B0000AZJXQ|5.0|What a beautiful piece of art by A Perfect Circle. Do not compare their work with Tool - they're different bands. It is really emotional at times. Beautiful use of guitars. Here is my analysis of the songs:<br />The Package - A decent song. It doesn't set the pace of the record however, so I'm not sure of the choice of it being the opener. 7/10.<br />Weak and Powerless - A brilliant, heart warming song. Very positive, but is repetitive a little. 7/10<br />The Noose - Quite possible the best song on the album. Emotional and very well polished. Nice structure and innovative use of vocals. 10/10<br />Blue - Brilliant song, which is slightly repetitive, but that doesn't matter when you're dealing with such a class work of art. 8/10<br />The Outsider - My favourite song. Thunderous vocals, excellent use of base guitar and pure brilliance. This song is the heaviest on the album, and arguably A Perfect Circle's greatest work. 10/10<br />Pet - A beautiful, mesmerising song. Amazingly chilling vocals by Maynard. Simply a great song. 10/10<br />Gravity - Uplifting experience. Possible the most &quot;boring&quot; song, but considering the whole album is amazing, that means nothing. 7/10<br />There you have it. It's a brilliant album, definitely the best of this year. This should belong in your collection if you appreciate works of art. It's as simple as that.
B00003CXB4|3.0|Sure, the king of beasts knows every inch of the Serengeti, but let's see that sucker try to navigate this DVD. For the long-awaited DVD debut of &quot;The Lion King,&quot; Disney has created one of the format's most byzantine navigation schemes to date. Seven-year-olds might sense some sort of internal logic here, but most parents will be stumped and peeved. Breathe, close your eyes and try very hard not to throw the remote control.<br />It doesn't help that the feature-film disc opens with eight &quot;sneak previews&quot; and a live-action commercial for Disney World. What should be an event experience is cheapened before it begins: &quot;The Lion King&quot; -- a crown jewel of modern Disney animation -- unspools like any straight-to-video kiddie show.<br />It's a shame, because otherwise, &quot;The Lion King&quot; gets the royal treatment. Restored and remastered, &quot;The Lion King&quot; looks and sounds spectacular. Colors can be wildly saturated without loss in definition -- as in baby Simba's Busby Berkeley-inspired &quot;I Just Can't Wait to Be King&quot; -- or subtle and true to life.<br />The audio defaults to the theatrical surround mix, but anyone with decent gear should switch immediately to the so-called Enhanced Home Theatre Mix (both are Dolby Digital 5.1). &quot;It will test your home system set-up,&quot; vows the proud rerecording engineer Terry Porter, who gets to explain his work in an unusual but quite welcome DVD extra. (It's on disc 2; dig deep to find it).<br />Most viewers will first view the new version of the film, which has an added song, by Elton John and Tim Rice, that's explained in a making-of featurette. Rice describes the music-hall-like &quot;Morning Report&quot; as &quot;a lot of bad animal puns.&quot; The song, sung by Zazu, runs less than 90 seconds and comes early in the film. It's fun, but you'll probably prefer the original pacing.<br />Viewers not interested in chasing around the DVD set to get the lowdown on the film -- there's a swarm of quick-cut Disney docus -- will do just fine with the commentary by producer Don Hahn and directors Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff. It's recycled from the laserdisc but not the least bit dated.<br />One of the best extras has old footage of  Elton John at the piano, tentatively unveiling &quot;The Circle of Life&quot; for the Disney team. Must to avoid: An unfortunate music video has the current stars of the Disney Channel romping through &quot;Circle of Life.&quot;here's a swarm of quick-cut Disney docus -- will do just fine with the commentary by producer Don Hahn and directors Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff.

0380789035|5.0|STORY: The man known as Shadow gets released from prison only to find his wife is dead. Not knowing what else to do with his life he finds himself getting sucked into a world under our own, unknown to most of mankind, where the gods of old are preparing to wage war against the gods of new.<br /><br />MY FEEDBACK<br />This was an amazing story. I was just caught up into the magic and expertise of the world created by Gaiman. This truly felt like one of the most original stories I've read in a long time. My only complaint is that I felt like this was a long book which is why I didn't give it a full 5 stars. Luckily, just when I was getting tired of a scene/situation, things would change and something new and unexpected would occur.<br />A nice mystery mixed with magic, myth and folklore. From the books that I've read that have won either the Hugo, Nebula or both awards, I have to say this is one that I feel really did deserve the awards won. Like his Sandman storyline, this is one that will keep you wondering what new surprises will happen next.<br /><br />Get it!!
B00006879E|5.0|This cd is great, I boughts it the other day with my Jason Mraz cd which I also higly reccomend if you bought this cd.  TO tell you the truth Harder to Breath is one of the weaker tracks on the cd.  Maybe because I've heard it soo much but I really do love the other ones.  Especially, SUNDAY MORNING, MUST GET OUT,THIS LOVE, AND THROUGH WITH YOU.  If you like Jamiroqui then you will love this cd, the lead singer sounds just like him but the backup music is amazing  which makes this band pure greatness!  PICK IT UP!
B00005JKZV|4.0|Well, first, I must start by saying that, while I do not consider myself a Tolkien purist, I am very enamored of his writing. I feel that some of the changes Peter Jackson made were very questionable, but after listening to his audio commentaty on the first &quot;Extended Edition,&quot; I believe I can understand why he made some of them. He made Faramir into a pseduo-bad guy so that the journey of Frodo and Sam towards Mordor wouldn't seem like a casual stroll. Think of how boring it would have been for the entirety of their story after the marshes to be them walking, accompanied by a few badass rangers. SNOOZE. The other bone I would pick with Jackson would be his treatment of the Ents. I think he botched that part of the movie, and can think of no real ratonale for that decision to have the ents needing &quot;convincing&quot; to go to war. Ah, such is life. I also thought that the pacing of the movie was far too rapid, and that the constant swapping between shots was difficult at the end. I am hoping that, with the extra time provided on the extended edition, some of these pacing problems will be resolved.<br />All in all, quite an enjoyable watch for those who haven't read the books, and an interesting, sometimes frustrating journey for those who have.

Jackdaws will definitly hold the reader's interest until the end, leaving a craving for more action.
0743243307|4.0|As someone below wisely noted, Monica Ali's first novel, shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize (and expected to have won, though it lost out), is in many ways a response to THE HOME AND THE WORLD, the beautiful turn-of-the-century novel by Rabindranath Tagore, the Nobel prizewinning Bengali poet and novelist. As in Tagore's novel, Ali's work shows the very circumscribed world of a Bangla woman, her husband who adores her, and the young man who excites her, and the competing claims the public life makes upon her own inner sanctum. Nazneen, the central character of Ali's novel, is extremely beautifully fleshed out, and her inner life is probed with great profundity despite the quietness of her actions and the closed-in nature of her immediate physical world. Her stubborn and talkative husband Chanu--at times contemptible, at other times quite loveable, and always human-- also emerges as a memorable three-dimensional character, and their interactions frame an intelligent meditation on multiculturalism, on Islam, on women, on Britain, on Bangladesh.  This is a superb first work.
6305428050|5.0|Chris Parker is in for one hell of a night!<br />A babysitter, Chris Parker (Elisabeth Shue) was looking forward to a date with her boyfriend, but he decides to cancel, and she's left feeling disappointed, of course. But, more importantly, she decides to keep an eye on kids Brad (Keith Coogan) and Sara (Maia Brewton) while their parents attend a gathering. However, Chris is suddenly faced with a challenge when her friend Brenda (Penelope Ann Miller) is scared to death, as she lands in a seedy downtown Chicago bus station, during her attempt to runaway from home. Chris has to make a choice: stay home with the kiddies, or go downtown to rescue her friend. Of course, she chooses the latter option, and takes the kids with her. Meanwhile, Brad's sex-obsessed best friend, Daryl (Anthony Rapp) happens to blackmail the gang into letting him come along for the ride. And from there, the action begins.<br />The kids bump into one misadventure after another in the mean streets of urban Chicago. From flat tire accidents, to auto theft, to gang fights, to secret criminal operation headquarter drop-ins, and then some -- somehow, no matter where they turn, these kids find themselves caught up in one catastrophe after another, so to speak. And, of course, their biggest challenge - other than making it through all the chaos in one piece - is to rescue Brenda, and make it back home before the parents arrive.<br />While the attributes of the film that were mentioned above sound pretty disturbing -- at least for a film aimed at the younger audience, there's very little that's dangerous in this film -- all of these elements are made to be kid - or rather - pre-adolescent-friendly. It's quite interesting and compelling how Chris Columbus made so many gritty elements appear fun and lighthearted, without sinking into sheer parody and silliness.<br />You can find guest appearances from many who would go onto more acclaimed projects. All in all, a lighthearted, fun, adventurous (pun excusable), charming and utterly poignant film. A guilty pleasure? Absolutely not - just a pleasure, as I have no shame in enjoying this film.), charming and utterly poignant film. A guilty pleasure? Absolutely not - just a pleasure, as I have no shame in enjoying this film.

This is a loving book that will stay with you forever.
0066620996|3.0|The unordained intent of business books is to make you think about certain tenets of performance, with case studies, and Good To Great definitely lives up to that credo. I could even say it is well-written.<br />But it may be instructive to note that the book represents ONE perspective about SOME arbitrarily chosen companies based on ONE metric, the data for which were collected and analyzed POST-HOC (known as \\"posthoc bias\\" to those in the know.) If you are expecting to come away with any pearls of wisdom about effective leadership or corporate success, you are preparing yourself for a mild disappointment.<br />Here are the insights you'll be exposed to, so make up your mind about how earth-shattering the offerings of this book are:<br />[1] Best leaders are not high profile folk but subdued, humble yet focused people who get results. (Not sure. Lee Iacocca, Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison, Jack Welch, Larry Flynt, Rupert Murdoch etc come to mind)<br />[2] Great leaders are supposed to believe in teamwork (Shlurp! Teamwork! Must make for a deliciously innovative reading)<br />[3] Companies need to focus on their \\"key profitability ratio\\" and hone it down to succeed. (Just me, or this swan-song of \\"focus\\" is painfully cliche? Also makes one wonder if business context is stagnant. What happens with KFC, Cadillac, Zenith who have tasted what it feels to run out of steam with a once beaming audience..would honing down their KPRs help? No mechanism to track these KPRs is forthcoming, that is your homework)<br />All in all, a tough call. I'd still recommend the book for some thoughtful inflight reading, if only for the WAY the authors make their case, but don't expect anything spectacular to ground your business/career on.
0553573411|4.0|I continue to be impressed by Hobb's work. This second book in the Farseer Trilogy has the same impressive strength of the first. The book is full of realistic characters, plausible politics, excitement and sympathy.<br />One minor quarrel-- nothing about these books has been predictable with the exception of the subplot revolving around the use of the Wit. Unfortunately, this one has been telegraphed from the beginning of the series and it was a little bit disappointing that so much of this book hinged on its use.<br />Still, one hackneyed element in two books is not bad at all-- certainly not by modern fantasy standards.
079073382X|5.0|Before Sunrise is a successful film by Richard Linklater (Slacker) starring Ethan Hawke (Dead Poet's Society) and the gorgeous Julie Delpy.  The two meet on a train from Budapest to Vienna and decide to spend the day in Vienna.  Their conversation is always interesting and philosophical, and the incidental characters they meet add humor and European atmosphere.<br />  The main feeling it gives you is the feeling of freedom, traveling in Europe carefree.  I've traveled myself in Europe like this, though the fantasy of having a &quot;10&quot; fall in love with me on a train never came true.  As for the conversation, one example is when Hawke talks about reincarnation: &quot;If we're reincarnated we are only 1/1000th of a soul, considering there were only a million people on Earth 1000 years ago&quot;.  An interesting, but half-baked idea.<br />I would've responded, &quot;We are all part of universal consciousness, we aren't separate entities, that's an illusion.&quot;<br />When Delpy says how her shrink thought she was a homicidal killer because of her fictional writing, it really drives home how much shrinks project and tend to think the worst in people; i.e. anti-humanists in a profession that should be made up of humanists.<br />  The characters they meet like the actor who plays a cow adds some great humor as well as the fortune teller (you're learning..50 shillings please) and the homeless poet: &quot;nice cakes, and milkshakes&quot;.  They were good vehicles to show Hawke as a symbol of American cynicism and Delpy one of European naive optimism.  There is a spontaneous realistic feel to it, the dialogue seems off-the-cuff yet intelligent, and my suspicion is Linklater was using his own semi-autobiographic incident.<br />  Another touch of realism in the dialogue is when Delpy talks about the war in Bosnia.  I'll take low-budget with good dialogue over high-budget with poor dialogue any day.

6305949980|5.0|I'd watched this movie a time or two before. My strange babysitter showed it to me when I was younger and I liked it but I really didn't get it. Then I discovered Edward Scissorhands and became interested in Tim Burton. So, I pulled out The Nightmare before Christmas from the Blockbuster's shelf, came home, and watched it. And I loved it- the strange music, the lyrics, the plot, and especially the characters. All of the characters are very real-strange for a fantasy movie. People of any age can watch this movie. Kind of like listening to Clay Aiken, which I'll get to later...but do yourself a favor and watch this one just once.
0060537639|5.0|I recommend this book highly, it is in no sense badly researched or boring, it is repetitive, though, in certain parts. How did the people with Chinese genes get to remote South American villages? How did the 500 ft. Chinese junk full of Ming china in its hold get into the Sacramento River in California and sink there? How did the various Portugese explorers know where they were going? Where did their maps come from, if they were the supposed discoverers of new routes? The answers are given in this terrifically interesting book. It's also fascinating to see how information can be lost or covered up and destroyed so that alsmost no traces of the giant armada remained in China--but traces do remain, no information can ever be entirely eliminated. The truth is always there to be found, this time, thanks to a man who just couldn't quit wondering why.

I have always kept up with the latest technology, but the most incredible thing about \\"The Nightfly\\" is how great it sounds on any system..lo, mid, ..or hi fi! Having been a Dan fan since Pretzel Logic, I was devastated with their demise, but along came this recording....truly one of the 10 best ever made. Fagan proves not only his skill as master musician, composer and lyricist, but he proves how incredible he is as a recording engineer!!! Slick, smooth, classy, savvy and incredibly musical, this album is one I can not or will not stop playing!! Check out Fagan's other magnum opus titled Kamakiriad. Good listening citizens!
076790382X|5.0|I bought &quot;I'm a Stranger Here Myself&quot; by curiosity.  Returning to America after twenty years in England sounded like an interesting parrallel to my own experience, just the other way around.  <br />The book is a pure delight.  I was caught in right at the first sentence: &quot;There are three things you can't do in life.  You can't beat the phone company, you can't make a waiter see you until he's ready to see you, and you can't go home again.&quot;<br />Then, I read in no time through  the 70 short essays (they were written as a weekly column to a British newspaper).  Each  treats one particular aspect of life in America.  It is admirably well-written, always humorous and many times frankly hilarious.  <br />From the parody of an IRS tax form and of a computer manual to the discussion between two British gentlemen on the Titanic that famous last night (&quot;Still, all in all it's not been a bad voyage, wouldn't you say?&quot;) to the reminescence of his father (&quot;practicing for a World's Most Boring Man competition&quot;) to the multitude of little Town America life aspect,  this book will delight you if you have a sense of humor.<br />I liked it so much that I bought another book from Bill Bryson, and will probably not stop until I've read all his books.
B00005LOUP|1.0|A bloated film calculated to inject gratuitous attacks on childhood innocence while hypocritically shoveling in cash and lecturing us on simplicity.  One of the ugliest things Hollywood has ever manufactured.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|\\"...[We] are here to understand the why, the reason...\\"-The Merovingian, Matrix Reloaded.<br />There is such poetry in this movie, both visual and spoken. The trick is to recognize and understand it. If one doesn't understand a certain poem, does one insult the integrity of it? If one did not understand Shakespeare, one would still recognize the pure genius poetry behind it, and would not call it \\"crap\\" or \\"a waste of time and money\\". <br />Just as Shakespeare was a master of the English language, poetry and stage, The Wachowski Brothers are masters of the visual medium know as movies. They utilize every resource known to literature and film making in order to craft their fine tale. This movie has everything: action, romance, philosophy; you name it and it is here. <BR>The story is obviously a continuation of the first Matrix movie and the second chapter in the trilogy. Returning in the story is Neo, the one, Morpheus, mysterious and wise leader, and Trinity, sensitive yet firm warrior/lover. Neo, having acquired magnificent powers since the first Matrix film, must continue on his journey to save humanity from the ever-present threat of the evil Machines; but not without with the aid of Morpheus, Trinity and a whole slew of new and intriguing characters.<BR> <BR>This film is a cornucopia of radically different ideas, yet the Wachowski brothers successfully mold all of the different elements into one cohesive whole. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie because, just like all of Poe's stories, this movie functions superbly on many different levels: One can enjoy this movie just for the action, devote in on the philosophical aspects of it, or ponder the question presented throughout the film.<BR>While this is an extremely complicated movie (many, including myself, had to see it numerous times, and even get written transcripts of certain scenes to fully comprehend it all), it is nonetheless extremely enjoyable. The speeches of the Oracle, Merovingian and yes, the ever-confusing Architect all contribute fascinating questions about fate, faith and humanity: What exactly is control? How can one make decisions of one's path is already decided? What is the matrix, and is the purpose of the one really just another form of control?<br />The people who didn't understand this movie obviously didn't care enough to think it over and try to comprehend it. Those who argue that many scenes were boring, misplaced and unnecessary also didn't understand a damn thing about this movie. Everything in this movie is necessary to the whole of the story; EVERYTHING is extremely interesting if only one take the time to understand it. There is enough interesting information in this movie to write a book, and still fit brilliantly into this movie.<br />This movie is yet another landmark in filmmaking history, and should go down as one of the greatest movies of all time because of how smart and entertaining it is. I myself have seen this movie at least 15 times, and would recommend anyone who asks me to go and watch this movie. Confusing, yes, but if one devotes themselves for five minutes to actually understanding the film, it would be well worthwhile. <br />The DVD does come with two discs, yet has far less supplementary feature than the first movie; this is its one and only downfall. However, since the features included on the discs are enjoyable to watch, and the movie is still so good, I will still give this a five out of five, and would give it a ten out of five if I could. <br />Watch this movie, and even if you don't understand it at first, devote some time to understanding this movie, and the rewards will far outweigh the work put in.

0345413377|5.0|Phillip Pullman has now become one of my all time favorite authors. After writting the pervious two novels in His Dark Materials (The Golden Compass and The Subtile Knife), I eargerly bought The Amber Spyglass. <br />With his tradmark flare and skills, Pullman creates a dark, wonderful and tragic ending to his triology. It picks up right where The Subtile Knife left off. From the first chapter on, there's no rear-view mirror on the Pullam car. The War between Heaven and Hell starts and our young heroes learn the vaules of love and loss, good and evil, and the most important aspect, the complex characterzation of man. <br />There are no words that can describe how excellent and rewarding this series is. You just have to read it for yourself! And good news for all us His Dark Materials junkies: The long-awaited \\"Lyra's Oxford\\" will be availble toward the end of this month. We will get a first-hand glance at Lyra's new life after the Triology and a detailed look at Pullman's fictional Oxford.
6304907648|4.0|COPYCAT stands on it's own despite being compared to SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  Truly frightening and suspenseful in scenes, the film works beautifully because of the cast (Holly Hunter and Sigourney Weaver) and the excellent script.<br />Sigourney Weaver character was stalked by a serial killer some years before, and as a result, is confined to her home where she lives in understandable fear.  The police now consult with her in her capacity as a criminal psychologist to find the identity of a new serial killer.  In the process, her world is once again turned upside down in a way which will make you want to jump up and lock your door.<br />CopyCat is a true gem of the suspense thriller genre but overlooked by so many as a 'copycat' of other great films.  Trust me, it really does deserve merit for its ability to remain as fresh today as it was upon first release.<br />Deserves a place in your DVD collection.
0553573403|5.0|George R.R. Martin has worked at Hollywood as a director and producer. So this guy knows how to enthrall an audience. He has worked on the television series Beauty and the Beast (which won an Emmy) and the Twilight zone. Many years ago.<br />In writing, GRRM's done a lot.

He has affirmed that there will be only six books, and the first three are packed with action, suspense, tragedy and brilliance.<br />Those who think his violence and sex scenes are gratuitous can think twice.

B00005JLKN|3.0|Don't expect a film better than &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; because &quot;Red Dragon&quot; is far from that.  This is the prequel to that film and a replacement for the 1986 film &quot;Manhunter&quot;.<br />&quot;Red Dragon&quot; once again stars Anthony Hopkins as the excellent Hannibal Lector, whom Edward Norton &quot;consults&quot; with to find out more about the Tooth Fairy serial killer.  The Tooth Fairy is played beautifully by Ralph Fiennes. The only problem is, it is a very long time into the film where he does anything frightening.  &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; had multiple suspense moments, whereas Red Dragon really lacks in this department.<br />Overall, I was quite disappointed with &quot;Red Dragon&quot;.  I found Edward Norton very dull, and too long before anything interesting happened.<br />For die-hard fans of the series only.
0767817486|2.0|This used to be one of my favorite movies but it no longer is. When I was younger I did not bother trying to comprehend the underlying message of this movie, nor any other movie for that matter. The message of this movie is now perfectly clear to me: convicts in Turkish prisons are frequently maltreated and tortured. Turkish prisons are inhumane and the entire justice system is flawed, corrupt and unjust. Moreover, the director of this movie implicitly implies that all Turks are barbarous, intransigent and uncivilized. This is corroborated by the fact that all Turkish characters in this movie are evil and their intentions are always malicious. Also an attempt is made to defame Islam and to show it as a religion which is inhumane, barbaric and merciless. On the other hand, Christians are depicted as humane and infallible. The principal point of this movie is that the Turkish society is flawed and atavistic as its justice system shows no mercy towards drug smugglers, rapists and murderers. Many of these assertions may be true but it would be a gross overgeneralization and oversimplification to claim that all of this is true and that these injustices are unique for Turkey. The director of this movie should have done some research at home before he set out to criticize an entire nation. Consider some of these facts: U.S.A. still has capital punishment; it has been demonstrated in many cases that the application of the death penalty is racially discriminatory (much more blacks are sentenced to death than whites); in many states, minors and mentally retarded are sentenced to death even though this violates the U.S. constitution; the U.S. government incarcarates people without letting them know what they have been charged with and denies them adequate legal representation etc. (Guantanamo Bay in Cuba). If these facts are not indicative of a flawed and unjust justice system, then what is? In my view, it is extremely hypocritical and cynical not to judge our own actions andtransgressions by the same standards we apply to others. This is a good movie but it would have been much better had it not been so severely biased and prejudiced.
B000069AUI|5.0|This cd is probally one if not the best album relesed in 2002. Baseing the cd off of its singles is a very close minded way of judgeing this great band, even if you love the singles. the best songs are Politik, God Put a Smile Up on Your Face, Amsterdam, Clocks, and The Scienteist. the whole album is wonderful! if the first was this good, they would be selling out ampatheaters accross the nation, if not the world. I had the pleasure of seeing this band in Atlanta last march (i think it was March...) and i must say they became one of my most memorable concerts that i have ever seen (along with R.E.M., Audioslave, Incubus, The White Stripes, and Queens of the Stone Age.) I love this album and if you buy it, it WILL NOT come out of your cd player for a lllloooonnnngggg time....i gurentee it!<br />&quot;Tell me I'm your politik&quot;
014028009X|2.0|Bridget Jones is your typical 30-something single woman in any large city around the world. At least that's what Helen Fielding would like us to believe. The truth is Bridget Jones is certainly an atypical 30-something single female from a &quot;comfortable&quot; background with a good job, in publishing as it happens, and all the attendant middle-class hangups about her physical size and what people think about her.<BR>If you are not part of this &quot;clique&quot; and you just know that she went to a public school and not the local comprehensive, then this book may well leave you cold. The only bits that will ring true are the getting righteiusly plastered with girlfriends whilst setting the world to rights and bemoaning all men as having far too much &quot;emotional f***wittage&quot;.<br />Frankly this book fitted a time and a place that just doesn't exist any more for most of the world's population. It passes a rainy afternoon but that is about all that can be said for it.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|Considering that &quot;The Matrix&quot; was and still is the gold-standard of DVD features (multiple audio tracks, commentary, several documentaries and featurettes, alternate viewing options ('follow the white rabbit'), cast and crew bio information, and MORE all on a single disc!), the absence of any such features on the 'Reloaded' DVD is disheartening.  I can only speculate that Warner Bros. Home Video is planning another 'Matrix Revisited'-type DVD to sell separately and make more money off of.  'The Matrix Reloaded' itself is a rare work of art.  The DVD edition is about as pathetic as a Paramount DVD release.  It is the quintesential waste of the DVD format, offering little over a VHS tape edition or a bootleg.  Rent it or watch it off cable.  Don't buy this version.  Wait for the inevitable 'Special Edition' to come out.
0066214122|5.0|Yet again Michael Crichton crafts a tale so compelling that you kow it could simply just happen.  In a world dominated by technology it is only a matter of time before some bright spark scientist starts looking at Crichton's novels as a blueprint for world destruction.<br />In Prey he tackles the subject of nanoparticles and also computer intelligence with horrifying results.  A simple computer program that helps systems problem solve is used to devastating effect when combined with swarms of nanoparticles allowing them to evolve independently of their creators, once released into the wild they become the hunter and their creators their prey.<br />Not the easiest of books to read as it contains plenty of technical knowledge but it is written with such conviction and so finely crafted that you can forgive him his forays into the &quot;technical stuff&quot; and just sit back and enjoy a thoroughly enjoyable ride.  Dealing with human relationships almost as much as the horrifying results of man's arrogance it is a real page turner and you will not be able to put it down, not even long wnough to wonder if that itch is really an itch or part of the swarm invading you.
B0000A5A0T|4.0|The rating, of course, is relative.  Practically any recording by Coltrane before 1966 deserves five stars, but \\"Blue Trane's\\" singular importance, it strikes me, has been exaggerated.  National Public Radio lists it in its \\"Basic Jazz Library\\" but omits \\"Giant Steps,\\" the recording that changed the harmonic language of jazz.<br />\\"Blue Trane\\" is one of many Van Gelder-engineered sessions featuring Coltrane's tenor in the 1950's.  Besides the Miles Quintet dates on Prestige there's sterling work by Trane on sessions with Kenny Burrell, Ray Draper, and Hank Mobley, to name a few..  \\"Blue Trane\\" is certainly an exemplary session, one moreover than inspires both Morgan and Fuller to reach new heights (though Fuller falters a bit on \\"Old Fashioned.\\"  One wishes  J.J. Johnson, especially after his superb Blue Note session with Rollins, had recorded with Coltrane).<br />The problem with the session, compared to the Miles Quintet recordings, is simply that Trane has to give up solo space to  an additional horn (if a sixth horn is to be added to the ensemble, it may as well be Cannonball Adderly's).  Also, opinions will vary, but an undeniable sameness attaches itself to the familiar, up-close,  \\"Van Gelder sound.\\"  Unless you're a Coltrane collector, the better bets from this period are the Columbia recordings, especially \\"Round Midnight\\" and \\"Kind of Blue.\\"  They capture superlative and stunning solos by Coltrane within the context of cutting-edge ensembles and three-dimensional sound.
0060278250|5.0|This book was great, I loved it. Garth Nix has written one of the best series I have read. It starts with Sabriel, followed by Lirael then Abhorsen.  It is definitally worth reading.  If you like His Dark Materials, I think you will like this! Read Sabriel first, it is very good but the next two are even better!
6304539282|4.0|Star Wars: A New Hope-A highly enjoyable beginning to the saga, this is easily the most light-hearted and accessible film of the trilogy.  Taking place in a galaxy far away, young Luke Skywalker is suddenly propelled into a galactic adventure against the Empire when he encounters two droids that bear an urgent message from Princess Leia, leading Luke to Obi-Wan Kenobi and pilot Han Solo.  Little do they know they'll be in a battle not only for their own lives but for the freedom of the galaxy!  Star Wars is first-rate escapist entertainment, with plentiful action sequences and high-tech visual effects.  Unfortunately, much of the dialogue, quite truthfully, reeks and the acting is only somewhat better (Only Harrison Ford and Alec Guinness really impress).  <BR>****/*****<br />The Empire Strikes Back-This superior sequel to Star Wars boasts a more complex and imaginative plot that bears plenty of intrigue and mystery (we get the first glimpse of Darth Vader's head, Yoda speaks of &quot;another&quot; hope), far superior special effects, and confident performances from almost the entire cast.  Director Irvin Kershner crafts some of the series' most memorable action sequences, including the battle on ice planet Hoth and the climactic lightsaber duel between Luke and Darth Vader.  The story separates into two threads, so the pacing isn't quite as consistent as the original.  The storyline following the Millenium Falcon is much more interesting and faster-paced than Luke's quest to become a jedi, but the latter story is just as vital.  <BR>**** 1/2/*****<br />Return of the Jedi-Long hailed as the weak link of the series, ROTJ boasts lots of rousing action sequences, terrific special effects, and decent performances, but little else.  The cliffhangers in Empire Strikes Back are lazily resolved and the continuing story is fraught with head-scratchers.  What exactly George Lucas was thinking when he included the Ewoks is beyond me, they're probably the trilogy's worst idea,period.  As cute eye-candy, they serve their purpose but they should have been kept in the background.  The battle of Endor Moon is cringe-inducing, with spear-toting teddy bears defeating high-tech imperial infantry troops with rocks and arrows.  If the special edition should have made any changes, it would have to be excising these teddy bears altogether!<BR>***/*****
B00008RH1H|4.0|&quot;Throne of Blood&quot;, aka &quot;Castle of the Spider's Web&quot;, is the third Kurosawa film that I've seen, and it's definitely different from the other two (&quot;The Seven Samurai&quot; and &quot;The Hidden Fortress&quot;). It's much more somber and introspective, less action-oriented, and the general theme centers on ambition and fate rather than cooperative action to overcome a common problem.<br />The film is an adaptation of &quot;Macbeth&quot;; only instead of taking place in medieval Scotland, it's set in feudal Japan. I tend to be a Shakespeare purist, but I really enjoyed the different historical setting. Warlords, samurai and huge, squat fortresses are depicted in full glory. The samurai costumes are so beautiful and intricately detailed that I had to pause the film just to stare at them.<br />In addition, the dialogue and acting have been altered to fit a Japanese setting. Many of the scenes are shot in the Noh style, which is a very old, very classical form of Japanese theater. In Noh, the drama plays out on bare stages. In order to compensate for such sparse environments, the acting tends to be highly stylized. To Western audiences, this may translate as unrealistic, but to Eastern, I presume it comes off as compelling.<br />Toshiro Mifune plays the title character, Washizu, who receives predictions of power and glory from a forest spirit. Spurred on by his ambitious, scheming wife, Washizu commits heinous acts in order to fulfill the prophecy. The effect is like a tightening noose as Washizu becomes ensnared in his own web of ambition.<br />The final scene is a cinema classic. Never one to go for cheap effects, Kurosawa uses professional archers and real arrows, and Mifune's reaction is genuine. The scene visualizes the claustrophobic mood of the film and the idea of inescapable fate. Kurosawa was a master of this type of filmmaking.<br />I'm always impressed by how much Kurosawa accomplishes with so little. Take the forest spirit, for example. He simply shot her in blinding white light and removed all high notes from her voice. It's effectively creepy, yet it's something filmmakers today, with their multimillion-dollar CGI effects, would not even attempt. It's for these moments of filmmaking ingenuity, which \\"Throne of Blood\\" abounds in, that Kurosawa has become so well respected.<BR> <BR>\\"Throne of Blood\\", despite a few slow parts and some overacting, is a gripping, haunting and worthwhile journey. It's also great filmmaking. I wouldn't recommend it to Kurosawa neophytes, but once you're hooked on the master of Japanese cinema, it's definitely one to seek out. If you're looking to purchase, the Criterion DVD is well worth the price; the film looks great and the commentary by Japanese-film expert Michael Jeck is entertaining and informative.
B000002H70|5.0|This is one amazing album and words really can do it no justice.Every song on here is at least good but the truly great ones would have to be the last five or so tracks.The whole cd has so much atmospere to it and is just incredible.Well what are you waiting for go out and buy Disinegration.
B00005M989|5.0|Whether this CD is technically the best of prince or not, I do not know or care. This CD is incredible, every song a hit, I cannot say enough about how much I love this CD. You can listen to it over and over again and just love it even more. 'U got the look' is such a classic, it is painfully sexy. 'kiss' is also a classic.. seriously every song is so freakin good this cd will never leave your cd player!
B00000JFV9|5.0|Now I, a brazilian 23 year old guy, almost post-student in Translation, see myself enjoying the wah-wah swing of Curtis Mayfield in 'Superfly,' a B-side movie which I, as well as other 'vintage lovers,' also loved as an outmoded but charming style. We're back to the question of 'Kitsch' in culture, and I think the fashion and shape of Mayfield's soundtrack is now being perceived more sharply in its context, just like any old good wine (isn't it the idea?) His swing has, I think, a next parallel here in Brazil: Jorge Ben in his late style, more swingable but sometimes too loose and just boring.

0312263120|4.0|I know nothing about cryptography or supercomputers, so I can't tell whether there are major or minor inaccuracies in Brown's descriptions of them (though, judging from the reviews, there are.)<br />But I do know  a little bit about Japanese, and in the first few pages of the novel there is a bit about how Becker is decoding into Mandarin Chinese, and suddenly tells them that all the characters he has translated are also part of &quot;Kanji language,&quot; a Japanese writing system, and that in &quot;Kanji language&quot; these Chinese characters have different meanings.  All wrong.  No one calls it &quot;kanji language,&quot; for starters. And characters used in Japanese as kanji (the word means &quot;Chinese characters&quot;) have the same meaning in Japanese as they do in Chinese.  If you had a sequence of kanji, you would be missing a lot of grammar in Japanese, but the meaning would be clear.  It would be like a sequence of nouns and verbs, maybe adjectives. A first year student of Japanese could have explained it to Brown.<br />So when I see a flaw like that on page 9, I wonder how he did with the far more technical stuff.<br />But his plot tricks are clever, and I read the whole thing with a grain of salt and enjoyed the ride.  Not as good as Da Vinci and Angels and Demons; closer to Deception Point.  He's got me hooked on thrillers, however, and now I'll have to find another author to read.

B00004XPPE|4.0|Very good at keeping your attention. Interesting to see so many great actors in one movie and still young. An excellent flix.
B000062X90|5.0|This is one of my all time favorites!The harmony in vocal and guitar are pure magic. My high school rock band(Home Grown) played some of these songs so they have special meaning to me. The stories told in Throw down the Sword and Warrior are more then just words with great lead guitar. I highly recommend getting this cd. If only for the fantastic dueling guitars. A pre- freebird harmonizer that was ahead of it's time. If you like Wishbone Ash at all, I believe this to be their very best.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Long ago and far away (well it was 1972 to be precise) the Zep came to Australia and played to a massive audience in Sydney. It was an outdoor gig but I still remember it. I think it was my first genuine rock gig. Seeing this DVD now brings the group alive again and for this every viewer should be grateful. The quality of this DVD is wonderful-the other reviewers tell you that and they're right. But you will take from this series of concert performances what you bring to them. If you never really GOT Led Zeppelin but you have a genuinely open mind (and ears)this DVD will win you over. If you were a fan to begin with then you'll be knocked out. If you never liked them and your mind is still closed...well this DVD won't help you! The high point? For this viewer it is the almost superhuman thrust and energy of &quot;Trampled Underfoot&quot;. Jesus! They attack the song as if they'll never play it or any other music ever again. Which in an odd sort of way is what all the best bands do. Miss this DVD at your peril. It shows you greatness of a kind we are not likely to see again.
B00005JMK0|5.0|I would love to purchase this movie on DVD. Especially with the soundtrack remastered in 5.1 or DTS! Despite its 80's release, it is still fresh.
0800177177|2.0|At one time I liked this movie.  This was when I saw it in November of 1992.  Now that it's over ten years later, this Dracula needs some Buspar and Prozac.  He's on the verge of an anxiety disorder. Unsure of himself, and a hopeless romantic, he has to hide in shadows, become a leather bat, and a wolf-beast for a few minutes a time.  Anthony Hopkins redeems the film beautifully by being the straight forward doctor who will make sure the vampire is seized and penalized to fullest extent.  Keanu Reeves and the rest of the cast provide characters as close to the novel as possible.  The film has heavy eroticism to mix with the horror of the vampire. <BR>     I read an interview with Christopher Lee, the most popular actor to ever play Dracula (7 times).  He wasn't happy with the movie.  Actually, Lee is the only actor to ever play the character correctly from the novel.  He talks at one point about the first scene with Gary Oldman.  Gary had a huge hair style and long red dress??  Excuse me?!  From the novel itself you'd read that Dracula was dressed all in black with a crimson cape and some white from his shirt showing. Sharp white teeth hid behind a grey beard.  His eyes had a red shine to them.  In all the films Lee made, he always integrated pieces of the novel from having read the novel several times. <br />    Look to &quot;Horror of Dracula&quot; and &quot;Bram Stoker's Count Dracula&quot; for accurate portrayals.  With vampires like this, there can't be much room for interpretation of the British Literature classic until the story is told.  Coppola is still a great director.  If he wanted to make a Dracula film, he should have called it his own.
0385504209|5.0|i guess i'm an odd one in that the judeo-christian-islamic tradition never made much sense to me. as a teenager, i came to one conclusion: the church is a man-made conspiracy to keep women oppressed. this book kind of builds on that theory using history as a backdrop.<br />a lot of what dan brown writes about is tied to what historians know about early christianity, pre-christian, and non-western faiths. and that's what makes it all the more interesting. it's an excellent, thought-provoking read.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|The genius concept of the Matrix has philosophy, kung fu, romance, mystery, eye candy, and great characterization. &quot;The Matrix: Reloaded&quot; is the second installment in the trilogy, once again dazzling us with tight visuals and a brain-teasing plot.<BR> While certainly not as mysterious as the first &quot;Matrix&quot; flick of 1999, &quot;the Matrix Reloaded&quot; is a great sequel in its ability to be as interesting as its predecessor was. Reloaded is not as mysterious because it answers questions, but is compelling for its new questions; as expected, this constant barrage of Q&amp;A is rather brain-teasing, and backed by a twisting, random plot for effect. <BR> We see Zion in this film. Zion was only talked about in the first one as we all know, and never actually shown. When they introduced the look of Zion in this film, I was slightly disappointed, because I had my own vision of it. In my mind's eye Zion wasn't simply one big dancing hall of rock, but a dark, dim retreat of humanity. The dance scenes really did bore me to death, and I felt they could have been handled better. <BR> Whereas the first Matrix had only a handful of characters, this one introduces an assortment of new players (and some without explained backgrounds at all). You'll either like this or dislike this, take it or leave it. I myself somewhat enjoyed the new assortment, even though it made the film feel a bit bloated in terms.<BR> Action scenes are back and better than ever. Neo versus Smith, Morpheus and Agents, highway chases, Neo flying... the list is endless. What is genius about these films is the choice to cut back on slow-motion effects - &quot;bullet time - allot, obviously because who wants to see some recycled and copied technique over and over again? We see the most &quot;bullet time&quot; at the beginning of the film, and that's basically it.<BR> Reloaded has been dissed because it accuses Morpheus of being a Shakespearean talking head... Morpheus barely talks at all in this one! He talks a bit much to one other character, once, but that's it. I found what he talked about interesting and it piqued my interest likewise.<BR> So there you have it. A beautiful, dark sequel. Not perfect, but I don't see any glaring flaws to condemn it &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;boring.&quot; The major problem I found in this film was the cliffhanger ending, and that's that.
B000089RVX|2.0|Well, a mainstream rock band with a female singer. Somewhat original and stuff, but I wouldn't be surprised if there were already 20 clones running around by the end of next year. Its decent music, the only reason most people associate them with rap/rock is because of their first single (my friend made me listen to it, I have given up on radio except for my good ol' Pix 106). Overall, my opinion on this band is that their singer is hot, but I will never buy this C.D. Thank you and good night.
B00008PX8P|5.0|In the year 3003, (if we haven't blown ourselves up or been rounded up and sold as pets on the Galactic Live Commodities Market,) someone looking up the phrase &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; in their supercomputer the size of a sugar cube will get something like this on their holoscreen:<br />&quot;Rock and Roll - a late 20th century phrase describing music created by small groups of mostly male musicians, played on percussive and amplified-electric instruments with vocals, and the lifestyle which accompanied that music, characterized by an idealistic belief in world peace, and in love shared freely and without commitment.  Examples of rock and roll bands:  The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Who, Led Zeppelin.&quot;<br />Searching further, the student of late 20th century music will likely be able to download and experience the material on this DVD - it's so good, that it's going to become part of the planet's cultural heritage.  This review, however, will likely be lost to obscurity sometime in the next 1000 years, so read it now while there's still time.<br />Here it is in a nutshell - this two DVD set gives Led Zeppelin fans everything we've ever wanted and more.  The sound, the images, the production, the choices made, are all nearly perfect.  The material is pure live performance - no &quot;creative content&quot; or &quot;dramatic embellishment&quot; of any kind - just film, film, film of rock, rock, rock being played live, live, live.  (If only some of our other great heritage bands would take a hint and give us more DVD's full of the same type of footage!)<br />The second disk in this two disk set would be the greatest rock and roll you ever saw - if it weren't for the first disk.  I am a hardened, veteran, tough-to-please lover of classic rock DVD, and I can say that, without any exception whatsoever, disk one of this set is THE GREATEST ROCK AND ROLL FOOTAGE OF ALL TIME.<br />I know, Muhammed Ali said something like that about himself - but he backed it up with his fists against Sonny and George, and Led Zeppelin will back it up as well on Disk 1.  Pop disk 1 in your DVD player, crank up the surround sound system, and if you are a real music fan, a half-hour later you'll be sitting there with an untouched beer on your coffee table, your jaw hanging slack, your phone ringing and you not getting up to answer it because that would mean pausing this and you aren't about to do that, no matter who it is on the line.<br />It's actually quite possible that Led Zeppelin never sounded as good on their studio albums, either technically or otherwise, as they do on Disk 1 of this set, in the Royal Albert Hall.  The sound is perfect, the video is perfect, and the performance is beyond perfection, into the realm of the supernatural.<br />Enjoy.  Easily worth twice as much as it's selling for.
B000002KLG|5.0|This CD is amazing.  There is not a single track that sucks here.  Everything is totally fresh and Q's producing is right on.  Patti Austin belts it on Moody's Mood.  Rit throws down on his own guitar parts.  The only downside is that it's short.  I would have loved to see this team do more together.  This is worth it just because of who worked on it.  The engineer, Bruce Swedien is still a force to be reckoned with. Q is always the consumate pro.  This is a total classic.  Enjoy it!

6305718954|4.0|i love this movie. but then, i'm one of those who questions religions generally. as someone else said, the premise is that father alameida was working to translate parts of the dead sea scrolls -- which are believed to contain something that promises to shake the foundations of the church. <br />weirdly, alameida's rosary winds up in the hands of an atheist woman who starts to experience the stigmata. and she also starts writing parts of the dead sea scrolls on the wall of her apartment. alameida is speaking (&quot;revealing the truth&quot;) through HER. A WOMAN. perhaps symbolic of mary magdalene.<br />stick with me here: some folks believe that mary magdalene was actually jesus' lover, and that SHE was supposed to carry on christ's teachings. and therein lies the premise for the movie.<br />there's lots of age-of-aquarius-the-truth-will-be-revealed type of stuff in here. oddly enough, reading &quot;the da vinci code&quot; by dan brown will help fill in some of the movie's gaps.
B000002UYZ|3.0|fair enough most on here are class and should be on but most are singles and there b-sides showing how good they were. but there are only a few albumn tracks on here and drive my car should be off with im only sleeping, she said she said, taxman and here there and everywhere on it it would be 5 star nevermind the other tracks that should be on here but good all the same classic rockn roll mostly from me to you is fantastic so is all my loving on 2nd cd girl, paperback writer, norweigan wood and youve got to hide your love away standout.<BR>good but should be better.
B00005JLWN|5.0|This movie -- set in the future -- starts off by recapping recent history.  The planet has just undergone its Third World War, and it resolves to avoid a Fourth.  This is accomplished by abolishing all human emotions - and thus all individuality - to eliminate the passions which lead to unavoidable conflict.  The world is angular and masculine and devoid of most color - where even the women dress like men.  The buildings look like Nazi temples.  And the rules are enforced by the Grammaton Clerics, who wear only tunics of black.  So if the movie looks a little like the Matrix. And if Christen Bale (as John Preston), the lead cleric, bears an uncanny resemblance to Keanu Reeves (which he does), then the similarity, I'm sure -- is purely intentional!<br />The population takes a drug to entirely suppress their emotions.  Adults - and children - are free to report anyone for extermination who shows any amount of feeling.  Preston's partner succumbs to emotion early and Preston does the honors.  The tables are soon turned, however, when Preston himself foregoes his daily dose, and he becomes overwhelmed by the beauty of the world that he now \\"senses\\" once the effects of the drugs begin to diminish.  He discovers the emotional richness of the world's past; the books, the paintings, the passages of music - and a woman, Emily Watson, who captures his heart -- to make his anguish complete.<br />The story is taut and well told.  And it builds to a climactic finish..  Preston joins the underground to help overthrow the world that the clerics are assigned to enforce.  Along the way, we are treated to some of the most beautifully choreographed hand-to-hand pistol combat I've ever seen.  The clerics also have this cool way of jumping into a group of six men - arranged around them like pockets in a billiard table - and then taking each one of the out, without ever changing their stance, by shooting and wrapping their arms around their heads as if they were doing yoga.<br />It isn'tuntil the end that we finally see the special up-their-sleeve speed loaders or the bulbous high capacity magazines that the cleric use with their automatic pistols -- that allows them to lay down a more blistering rate of fire than the multiple machine guns arrayed against them.<br />Even Preston's young son, a miniature Nazi himself, provides one of the nicest twists towards the story's conclusion as Preston proceeds towards his irrevocable goal - to set in motion events that will eventually destroy the current world order and restore the sanctity of human existence.<br />The movie starts off like a Matrix wannabe, but finishes by delivering some of the most exciting exhibitions of action, artistry - and emotion - I've ever seen displayed together in a pseudo sci-fi flick!  This is a film I highly recommend.  Don't miss it!
0679736646|2.0|Phil Dick is my favorite writer, but of the 15 books I've read by him, this is my least favorite. The plot is confused and the characters, never a strong point in PKD's books, are one-dimensional at best. The title of the book, which seems to be related to entropy, reality, and the notion of saving grace, is given very little treatment. These notions could have made for a great novel, but the ideas are not even half-fleshed out.
B00005JLK1|4.0|Cheesy?  Yeah. In some spots.  Original?  Not necessarily.  Fun? Yeah!  The old haunted house on a doomed and abandoned luxury liner.  Some good jolts, great FX, fun music and sound.  Really good for what it is.  If you are looking for mindless, gory entertainment - this is a good fix.  The opening: Great!!!
B00005JKZV|4.0|Looking at the size of the reviews on the page today, there are some strong opinions about this adaptation of Tolkien's books. My review is a little bit smaller.<br />It's good. It's not the book, but it's still good. No, it's not great; the true greatness shown in the books involved a lifetime of rewriting and world building, study and thought and rewriting again. Tolkein tinkered for DECADES over those books, that universe. Peter Jackson only had a couple years to try and take them and make them real, while dealing with budget, actors, and real life in New Zealand and Hollywood. So no, it's not the same. But.... darn good show, anyways. Glad I saw it, gonna watch it enough times over the years that it'll pay for me to own it on DVD.<br />So... if you're having trouble making up your mind, consider this: will you be renting it to watch more than once or twice in the next 10 years or so? If yes, shuck out the cash and buy your own copy. If no, then give your money to some video place and borrow their copy for a day or so.<br />It's not an agonizing chioce, people. It's just a movie. The book is something completely different, a labor of love created by a scholar and consumed passionately by hundreds of millions of people. The movie is cool. Get over it.
0385504209|1.0|Forget taking the On-line IQ tests. Read half the book, and if you can figure out the plot, congratulations, you have a 100 IQ. If you need to read to page 300, sorry.
B000089RVR|5.0|I own previous Dido CD (Angel). This new CD is best music I ever heard. I enjoyed whole album. Especially track 3 and 10. If you want to experience perfect music and angel voice, this album is for you...
0790729628|5.0|Ridley Scott is a director who, at times, can perfectly create a certain atmosphere he desires for his films, most notably being Alien and Blade Runner.  As he captured the void of space, fear of unknown, deadly creatures within confined space in Alien, he is able to channel some of the best qualities of an usual Philip K. Dick novel- surrealism.  <BR>  Many of Dick's science fictions focus on the grim, dark outlook of the futuristic world he creates, and infuses a sense of other-world into them, which worked well and create a legion of followers, not to mention several films influenced by or adapted directly from his works.  <BR>  In Blade Runner the main conflict is Deckard hunting down the androids, who possess many humane qualities that Deckard feels certain sympathy towards them, or at least thinks twice about the job he's about to do.  At the same time Deckard questions his own identity, and has certain doubts about his own existence of himself being a human, not an android.  The androids he terminates also have strong will towards life, a very human desire.  Top that theme with the dark portrayal of Los Angeles, with brilliant narratives are the reason this film remains as one of the most influential science fiction films of all times, and easily the best adapted work of Dick.  Scott obviously picked up the spine of the original short story, and was able to create the perfect world for the story, and added more character development to be a successful film.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|This is by far the best cd i have ever listened to in my life....His voice is so awesome....Every song on there has a different meaning and they're all just the best!!! If you don't have this cd...I recommend you get it or you're missing out so much....And request his new video..Follow Through...on VH1...
0618002227|5.0|It's all here! This is the book that started it all! Jrr Tolkien was a brilliant professor of german philosophy and ancient languages. It took him over thirty years to write 'The Lord Of The Rings' based on his epic mythological poem &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, penned during WWI. <br />In this classic epic, the Hobbit Frodo Baggins, relative of Bilbo Baggins who gets his own adventure in the book &quot;The Hobbit&quot; (which forms part of the back history to LOTR's) must travel from his home in the Shire (based on Oxfordshire where Tolkien lived) to the evil kingdom of Mordor to destroy the One Ring, a magical talisman created by Morgoth the Dark Lord. In the present Third Age, Morgoth's agent Sauron seeks the ring with the help of the corrupted wizard Saruman and his army of goblin-orcs. On his travels Frodo meets elves, dwarves, nature spirits, guardian-angels, fairies and heroes. His protector is Aragorn, disinherited heir to the throne of Gondor, destined to overthrow the mad pretender-king Denethor, who tries to burn his own city, like Nero. This books has all the whiz-bang special effects magic of the classic Grimms fairy tales, the trolls and unicorns you love to read about in Arthurian fantasy and the heraldic splendor of a medieval tapestry. The languages are unique to the book, invented by professor Tolkien as a game to play with his clever children. <br />If you enjoyed Peter Jackson's profound and entertaining movie adventure you will enjoy the book it so faithfully evokes - The Lord Of The Rings by Jrr Tolkien!
B00005OWEG|4.0|Validates the whole idea of DVD, as the true expression of the Director's vision.<br />The added footage further explains the idea of the American mistake, as we see the French plantation and it's lost inhabitants, almost hazy and shimmery in the jungle.  I still think that Sheen is unconvincing as a commando, he looks ragged and unhealthy, and devoid of any muscle mass.  perhaps his willingness to do the dirty work made him the candidate, as far as the generals were concerned.  The movie itself has an ending that is a bit flaky, reminiscent of tying up loose ends, but it does not detract too much from the scene-that of  a lost group of Americans, who find themselves in the nightmare of a lifetime, doing the best job they can.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Coming from a huge Tool and APC fan, Maynard once again shows his sheer brilliance in Thirteenth Step.  The lyrics are incredibly deep involving a man battling schizophrenia while the music, written by Billy Howerdel, has evolved from Mer De Noms, and has taken on a mystifying and intriguing new sound.  The additions of James Iha and Jeordie White are also huge improvements, and allow APC to do things that were formerly impossible.  I recommend this one whole-heartedly.
B000022TSW|5.0|I wasn't a fan of this show when it first aired. i thought 9-year old boys cussing and making homo sexual and racial jokes was sick and mean. But the movie changed my mind. I mean, Satan breaks out in a musical number. How could you not love that? I also loved Cartman's line about Jewish candy. Saddam is in this movie, too- in fact, he has a very large part. But I will not say how here. I wouldn't buy it on DVD yet; there will be a special edition 2-disk DVD coming out in '04. This movie is definitly not for kids. But I will admit that it's biggest fans ARE kids.
B0000C7PQK|2.0|I enjoy listening to Enigma, especially the earlier works. But this CD isn't worth spending .99 cents for a song. I was checking out the songs on iTunes prior to just buying a CD and it wasn't worth spending any money on it. I'm glad that there is a service that let's you preview all the tracks before getting stuck with an album that will be used as a frisbee. I think only people that worship Enigma will enjoy this CD, I'm sorry, but I couldn't.
B00005ATQF|3.0|Tries to do too much, schizophrenic in it's story telling, and frankly, I had a hard time identifying with the characters.  Nonetheless, it has some good action sequences, with the obligatory anti-war message.
B000066NW0|1.0|this music is crap.  Avril is a loser. shes a hipocrite who thinks she's punk then throws all this guitar pop music at us while flashing the rock on sign.  unless you are a girl under 12, get a clue, haven't you heard her live???!!! she even sucks then.  GOD i don't know what to say to get people to realize what the stupid corporate media is trying to feed them.  the lyrics suck, Avril sucks, her voice sucks, her guitar skills suck, her skatboarding skills suck, her people skills suck and this album sucks.  SO DON'T WASTE YOU MONEY ON THIS CRAPPY ALBUM, try buying some quality music that is actually punk (if you like that thing)
0385504209|4.0|Have you ever left a movie, limp, exhausted and just wrung out? Were you on the edge of your seat the whole time? The Da Vinci Code left me that way.  Everytime I relaxed a little, \\"Okay, they made it through THAT crisis\\", up would come another.<br /> Author Dan Brown takes his major characters, symbologist Robert Langdon and cryptologist  Sophie Neveu through a harrowing search/journey that leaves you with more information than you probably want to know about art history, symbolism, ancient religions, cults, architecture and much more.<br /> Although the flashbacks are too long, wordy and at times intrusive, the plot, the use of modern technology and the sheer speed of the action make this a book you will find hard to put down.
B000002G7G|5.0|After the fierce White Light/White Heat, this third album saw the Velvet Underground in a calmer, more contemplative mood and exploring their softer side which first surfaced on songs like Sunday Morning and I'll Be Your Mirror on the first album.<br />The exceptions are What Goes On with its shimmering guitars and Beginning To See The Light with its urgent rock riff and almost Stones-like flavour. Some Kinda Love is softer although there is still that unique driving sense of nervouness in the rhythm.<br />The gem of the album is Pale Blue Eyes, where Reed surpasses himself as a poet in the intimate, evocative images. This song also has one of the Velvets' most gripping melodies and the delivery is perfect. A gentle ballad with a wistful feel, Pale Blue Eyes must be one of the most beautiful songs of all time.<br />There are plenty of beautiful ballads like Jesus, I'm Set Free and That's The Story Of My Life. The Murder Mystery consists of spoken and sung parts over a brooding backing that becomes dissonant toward the end. This classic album concludes with the playful acoustic number Afterhours.
B0000549B0|4.0|I cannot think of another movie that shows the breadth of Stewart's acting ability.  His portrayal of the gentle, but quietly confident alcoholic was far different than his roles as either a lanky do-gooder, or as a righteous man of principle.<br />Here is Stewart in a perfectly subtle statement on conformity in society and the penalty for those who either conform too much or not enough-and shows that they knew how to make satirical gems way back in the day!  This movie is about rigid thinking and and it's effects, both good and bad.  Hilarious, too!
B00006879E|3.0|i bought this album because of the song &quot;harder to breathe&quot; which is obviously one of the few songs on it that doesn't bear a striking resemblance to the backstreet boys or N'sync.  but i think they have something pretty cool going on it just needs a little work.  from the lyrics to the sound, they aren't quite good enough yet, but if they head in the right direction this could become an awesome band.  it is a stretch to call it rock music though, clearly its pop, come on people, why is everyone so afraid to admit that they like pop????!!!<BR>but seriously, its worth it to buy the album, even if the only song you like is harder to breathe, just buy it...you'll come around
0782008119|2.0|If you're a fan of that genre of &quot;music,&quot; I guess this movie is for you.  For me, it was nothing more than a cure for my insomnia.<br />Blech!
B0000AXE8I|1.0|if u take out the first hour and you leave the car chase scene, that would have cut 1 hour of pure crap.  This movie was a waste of time ruining the legacy of the first one.
B0000AUHOH|2.0|There are times when you can tell while watching a movie that a director has a great sense of storytelling and vision but is being held back by restrictions that are beyond his control.  There was unquestionably A LOT of problems when this movie was put together, but this was NOT one of those times.  <br />It was pretty clear, from the minute the movie opened with that ridiculous opening camping scene; William Shatner's ego was firmly in the driver's seat for the fifth installment of the once-noble 'Star Trek' franchise.<br />Now the outside problems for this project were serious and many.  The screenplay was assembled during a writers strike and the budget for special effects was about a third of previous installments.  Both of these issues were EXTREMELY noticeable.  <br />Shatner though, at no point, rose to the occasion.  He took that flaming wreck of a movie and drove it right over a cliff.  Wonderful character actors such as David Warner are completely ignored, classic characters such as Mr. Scott and Uhura are turned into nothing short of caricatures, and Spock and McCoy have become a traveling support group for Captain Kirk.  All while William Shatner pretends to be Errol Flynn playing Captain Kirk.<br />Other then mere curiosity or the desire to simply have a complete collection of Trek movies, there'd normally be almost no reason at all to even consider picking this movie up.<br />So all that said, why did I buy it?  Well, for starters, I (admittedly) am a Trek fan and wanted to have a complete collection of movies.  Secondly, and most redeeming, the special features on the DVD are really terrific!  There are just a TON of material to pour through and spend your time watching.  Another reviewer pointed it out, but I also think it's true, it almost seemed like Paramount knew how bad the movie was and tried to apologize by LOADING it with content.<br />Still not a good movie, but if you're a fan and you're on the fence about picking it up, don't necessarilydismiss it based on just its (well-earned) reputation.  You might actually end up enjoying it, even if it is for reasons you might not have expected.
B00006BTCA|5.0|this is definately the best album of 2002.  Interpol can be compared to Joy Division, but the truth is they have something new and inventive going on which makes them unique.  The album isn't wierd, its different in an awesome way.  their lyrics are amazing and the cd keeps getting better.
B00164GDD2|5.0|Ghostbusters is great because it has elements from many different genres: romance, action, science fiction, horror, and above all, comedy. I've never met anyone who didn't start singing along when they heard the ghostbusters theme song! An American classic.
B00003CXXP|1.0|If you share my, and countless others', admiration for Stanley Kubrick's remarkable body of work, you might also be lured into viewing this film, if only to sate a justifiable curiosity.  However, this film has virtually nothing to do with Kubrick and everything to do with Spielberg, which is to say everything to do with cloying sentimentality, a simplistic and immature take on morality, and nothing to do with a serious investigation of the human condition.  *  I'm afraid I found nothing redeeming about this film.  It would be in a way better if it were billed as Pinocchio 2, but even then it would be a poor sequel.  The emotional world of all the adult characters is ugly.  Without the aid of the hyperbolic musical score and manipulative cinematography it would be difficult to know whether Spielberg was aiming to represent anything resembling real love.  The love depicted here is not worthy of even a robot.  Also, as is virtually invariably the case in Hollywood movies, sex is represented in a very negative and competitive way - there is nothing celebratory or joyous here.  I also found the performances of Osmond and Law less than interesting, although the blame should be laid squarely at the self-satisfied feet of the director.    *  If you have only seen Kubrick's more celebrated later work, 2001 and the films thereafter, then I'd beg you not to tarnish your impression of him by viewing AI, but rather seek out his earlier masterpieces, Paths of Glory, Lolita, Spartacus, and the unfortunately all too relevant Dr.Strangelove.
B0000C9V3T|5.0|When I first saw this film I was completely speechless when the film was over. When I saw it the second time I was speechless again and just couldn't compare it to any film. After seeing this movie about three times now I went and bought the soundtrack. I love the way Tarantino takes the time into picking what music should be put into his films. Every song on this soundtrack completely fits the film beginning to end.<br />If you like Tarantinos previous films and soundtracks to his films, then this film and its soundtrack will just completely blow you away. I recommend you buy this soundtrack and I can't wait to see Kill Bill Vol.II and see what music it has to offer.
B000001GS0|5.0|Phew, glad I bought this set. The other reviews convinced me that the sound wasn't poor or anything, and after listening myself I can now recommend this two-disc set myself to other people, who are maybe as of yet unsure whether to buy this 'cheap' mono Brahms symphony cycle. Not that I dislike less than top-notch sound...caliber of the playing and interpretation of the conductor are for me the things to go for.<br />Immediately I was stung by the high-voltage First, of which I only own one other recording, namely the Klemperer with as bonus the Tragic Overture, Op. 81 and the Alto-Rhapsody with the incomparable Christa Ludwig. I don't want to drift away, but I feel the urge to tell you to check that one out also.<br />To return, I like Jochum's recording of the First better than Klemperer's. Okay, the Second in this set is great too. For the Fourth I stick to Kleiber. <br />Anyway, the other reviewers here go into much more depth than me, so I thought it nonsense to rephrase their comments. If one more 5-Star blurb makes you open your wallet, the better, or so I thought.<br />Note: the finale of the first symphony is shattering...
B00008J2DQ|3.0|First off, I will admit that I haven't listened to any of Godsmack's albums from start to finish. I only know all of their singles from the S/T to &quot;Faceless&quot; due to radio airplay. &quot;I Stand Alone&quot; is a very convincing and powerful recording. When I find myself turning up the volume in my car, that's usually my criterion for how hard something rocks, and I turn up &quot;I Stand Alone&quot; every time it comes on.<br />That said, I only want to comment on a couple remarks Mr. Sully Erna has made in the press. I recently saw a URANIUM episode with the often self-righteous Julia C. asking a typically loaded question to Godsmack about the &quot;lame bands currently touring with Ozzfest that suck turd&quot;. She was referring of course to limpbizkit and Linkin Park. Mr. Erna almost interrupted her by replying, &quot;you said it exactly&quot;. <br />Along with the usual smug demeanor he displays referring to 'hard' his band is, Erna has a lot of nerve putting down easy targets like lb and LP when 1) he's now a part of the same media machine, and 2) his band and its music hardly seem original, since Godsmack's namesake is from an Alice in Chains song TITLE (not lyric, but title), not to mention the painfully obvious Alice influence. Also, there's unmistakable rip-offs of Korn on the early singles, not just in musical content but even in performance. Have a look at his microphone/stage movement on the S/T &quot;Whatever&quot; video (shot from live gigs), you will shudder at how similar it is to Jonathan Davis. It looks like an imitation one would do at a party, except Erna wasn't joking. <br />And as far as Erna's arrogant boast about &quot;Faceless&quot; not being matched by Korn, Staind, POD, et al? Korn certainly misses from time to time nowadays, but at least they have put together a formidable catalog of heavy-yet-varied classic songs, not to mention the sound innovation they brought to the music industry which helped open the door for Godsmack and countless other bands (and assured Korn's place in the annals of metal history, for better or worse). <br />These are the reasons that there are still many unanswered questions regarding Godsmack. As popular as they are, the general heavy-music-loving public hasn't yet heard anything truly original from them...<br />...and lyrics like, &quot;I hold you with my inner child&quot; don't help matters much, either.

B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Contrary to all the Negative reviews I've read of this Album, I say that this Album by APC is, by far, the greatest Album released yet this year.  From the first track &quot;The Package&quot; to the Last Track &quot;Gravity&quot;, this Album is a journey through the Human Psyche, that has not been paralleled since Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall&quot;.  Both are Dark, Deep, &amp; Thought Provoking in their style, and the Lyrics make you THINK.<br />I'm not surprised that a lot of people were expecting something Harder from APC this time around, but that's not what they are all about.  This album is a work of pure Genius, and you only have to listen to it on Headphones ONCE to understand what I'm saying.
B00005JM4Z|4.0|2 Fast 2 Furious is one of a few sequels that is actually better than the first.  This one picks up where the first one left off with Brian O'Connor, now off the police force, drag racing cars in Miami.  After getting caught by the police, O'Connor agrees to help take down a drug kingpin who needs good drivers to help transport \\"goods.\\"  Joining him is his childhood friend, Roman Pierce, who has had a falling out with Brian, but we do not know why.  The thin plot is really just an excuse to show fast cars, beautiful women, and great action, but who cares?  This is a great movie to watch that never slows down from beginning to end.  Just like The Fast and the Furious, this one has great driving sequences, some which remind you of the Blues Brothers, and an overall feel of cool to the whole movie.  The scene where Brian and Roman are trapped by the police towards the end is great as is their Dukes of Hazard jump off a pier.  This is an exciting movie that will keep you interested throughout.<br />  Paul Walker and Tyrese Gibson are very good together as Brian O'Connor and Roman Pierce.  Their friendship is surprisingly believable and much better over the one between Walker and Diesel.  Personally, I think that is the reason this one is better.  Eva Mendes and Devon Aoki are basically eye candy for the movie and look great doing so.  Cole Hauser stars as Carter Verone, the drug kingpin, who unknowingly has been infiltrated by numerous federal agents and police officers. Rapper Ludacris also stars in a very good role as Taj, a former racer who now stays out of the races and organizes them instead.  The DVD offers plenty of very good extras including the widescreen presentation, trailers, deleted scenes, outtakes, commentaries, and behind the scenes documentaries.  2 Fast 2 Furious is a fun movie to watch that is even better than the first.  Don't miss 2 Fast 2 Furious!
B000002LAC|5.0|I remember hearing in 1977 that Dolly, Linda and Emmylou planned to record an album together but I was very surprised when it actually happened ten years later after several false starts. It was certainly worth the wait - indeed, I think it is the finest album that any of them have recorded, separately or together. Given how highly I rate so many of their solo albums, that is saying something special.<br />Some of the songs may be familiar. To know him is to love him is an early Phil Spector song, which was a huge hit in the fifties for the Teddy bears and was successfully revived in the sixties by Peter and Gordon. Both of those versions pale by comparison with the version here.<br />Making plans is a Johnny Russell song that Dolly previously covered as a duet with Porter Wagoner. They had a number two country hit with it, only being blocked from the top spot by Old flames can't hold a candle to you, a solo single by Dolly.<br />The pain of loving you, written by Dolly, is another song previously recorded as a duet by Porter and Dolly. Farther along is a gospel standard. It shares the same tune as Green pastures, a song that Emmylou recorded for her Roses in the snow album. My dear companion is a song by Jean Ritchie, who has written several great songs. Rosewood casket is a traditional song of unknown origin. Hobo's meditation is a song from the pen of the singing brakeman, Jimmie Rodgers. Wildflowers is a song that Dolly wrote about leaving her mountain home in a quest for success. Those memories of you is a cover of a hitherto little-known bluegrass song. Telling me lies and I've had enough are also brilliant.<br />Any fan of traditional country music should listen to this, the best such album I've ever heard or am ever likely to hear.

Also for people who loves zim zum's or John5's guitar writing/playing on MA and AcS ive got to say that it was Twiggy Rameriaz that recorded the guitar and Zum and 5 were only the live guitarists, but Zum recorded some parts on MA and 5 has writtin on the other albums (Holywood and GOAG)So buy this album now!
B0000C7PSW|5.0|Rufus Wainwright's opening song &quot;Oh What a World&quot; has simple lyrics which, as they repeat, build layer after layer into fugue-like bombast.  It stresses from the start that this album is abouts sonics.  It will have a dense complex sound and a cleanly produced real orchestra throwing harps and horns into the mix.<br />&quot;I Don't Know What It Is&quot; starts slow and builds to a crescendo as well.  By its finale, it sounds like Phil Spector movie music.  Wainwright and his producer Marius Devries parlay this excess into camp charm.<br />&quot;Vicious World&quot; is a romantic lament backed by a vibraphone from a Mirwais producers album or a chill-out disc.<br />&quot;Pretty Things&quot; is just Rufus and his piano proclaiming his Wildean aestheticism.<br />&quot;Go or Go Ahead&quot; starts with a lovely Wainwright vocal over acoustic guitar and builds to a blistering rock 'n' roll climax--at least by tuneful Rufus standards.  Shades of 70s bands like Queen or Boston:  power chords and creamy harmonies.  A masterpiece of production, it's one of the album's best songs.<br />&quot;Vibrate&quot; is a bit throwaway but it's clever fun.<br />&quot;14 Street&quot; ushers in the album's finest moment where Tin Pan Alley melody, saloon piano, and witty poetic lyrics come together in a tasty mix.<br />&quot;Natasha&quot; is pleasant but unexceptional.<br />&quot;Harvester of Hearts&quot; may be the best vocal on the album.  Rufus' voice, in its higher register, sounds delicate and expressive.  The song is lovely too, though it repeats the word &quot;people&quot; too many times.<br />&quot;Beautiful Child&quot; is a nu-gospel stand-out that reads like a Blake poem. Again, dense busy production makes for a layered treat that may requires headphones to fully appreciate.<br />&quot;Want&quot; and &quot;11:11&quot; are slower songs with the occasional lyrical highlight, but they're not among my favorites here.<br />The album concludes with &quot;Dinner at Eight,&quot;another contender for the album's finest moment.  A beautiful melody wed to lyrics of David-and-Goliath combat, it's both a father-son love letter and piece of oedipal hate mail.  The orchestra is used to great effect here, especially the harp whose ripples mimic &quot;the drifting white snow&quot; of the lyrics.<br />Rufus Wainwright, along with Ryan Adams, Beck, an underrated Joseph Arthur, and a revived Tori Amos, are the singer/songwriters to watch in the new millenium.  Rufus has kicked it up a notch with &quot;Want One.&quot;  I wait eagerly for his promised sequel &quot;Want Two.&quot;
B0000B1OFL|5.0|What a great movie, an avid fan of the &quot;British MIni&quot; even before BMW stole the Mini. It was an easy viewing film that kept you smiling all the way through. The computer technology was just the best and left me thinking, that could be real!! The next time the lights go out here in New York I will think of the &quot;Italian Job&quot; It makes me want to go out and buy a Mini, with of course a Union Jack on the roof.Buy this film, you will love it.
B000059HAI|3.0|it's not a bad film, but why would amazon list kurosawa as one of the directors when none of the scenes he shot were in the final film?
B000006OAM|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite CDs. I got it at age 12 and now, at 17, it still takes a spin in my CD player quite often. I love all the songs, and they all hold such meaning for me. I love all of Natalie Merchant's work, but this is her best. She is an amazing musician, singer, and songwriter. Tori Amos (though I love her dearly!) shouldn't get all the credit for piano-playing! Natalie is INCREDIBLE too! I'll tell you a little bit about each song:<br />OPHELIA: This title track is brilliant and cryptic and very interesting. In the CD jacket Natalie portrays several of the characters mentioned in this song (such as a Carmelite nun, a circus performer, etc.).There are some people talking in foreign languages at the end, and I've never figured that out. If someone does, please tell me! This is a great song regardless, though.<br />LIFE IS SWEET: Natalie herself said that this is one of her favorite songs she's ever written. It's brilliant, uplifting, and inspirational. So much of the music out there these days is degrading and depressing. Way to go Natalie for upholding the true spirit of REAL music!<br />KIND AND GENEROUS: The biggest hit from this album, this is a sweet and simple tune. I've heard that it's dedicated to her fans; that she's thanking them for her success. If that's the case... You're welcome!!<br />FROZEN CHARLOTTE: Guaranteed to make me cry. Judging from the other customer reviews, this is a fan favorite. Some people went so far as to say that it was the best song of 1998! What UI love most about Natalie is that she can write strange, poetic, and cryptic lyrics that are nearly impossible to understand, and the meaning of the song truly comes out in the way she sings the words. &quot;Frozen Charlotte&quot; is a prime example of that. A standout track on an album of standout tracks.<br />MY SKIN: This (tied with &quot;Thick as Thieves&quot;) is my favorite song on the album. Natalie is an amazing writer and pianist, and here her voice goes from teary and whispery to an angry shout, and the result is one of the most beautiful songs ever performed. Natalie also portrays the character in this song in the CD booklet. <br />BREAK YOUR HEART: This is more typical Lilith Fair-fare, and has never been one of my favorites on this album. It's not bad by any means- on another album it would be the best track! &quot;Break your Heart&quot; sort of reminds me of an energetic Sarah McLachlan. <br />KING OF MAY: This song is dedicated to the late Beat poet Allen Ginsberg, whom Natalie greatly admired. This is a very touching tribute that may well be a classic some day. Somehow, the first line &quot;Farewell today&quot; really gets to me. It brings tears to my eyes every time I hear it.<br />THICK AS THIEVES: The epic centerpiece of this album. It's about war, but which war I don't know. I'm guessing it's about the Crusades, but I'm not sure. If anyone knows, be sure to say! Confusion aside, this is a wonderful, and creepy, song. It, along with &quot;My Skin&quot; is the best song on the album. It's full of meaningful lyrics (which can be read aloud like a poem- it's reminiscent of T.S. Eliot's &quot;The Waste Land.&quot;), like &quot;Know no future, damn the past, blind, warm, ecstatic, safe at last.&quot; If this doesn't send chills up your spine, you must not be human. She chants most of the song until the end, which is beyond-words-incredible. I could go on about this song forever. By &quot;Ophelia&quot; just because of &quot;Thick as Thieves.&quot; Trust me on this one!<br />EFFIGY: A profoundly disturbing song, featuring a guest artist singing in Tibetan. Natalie repeats the lyrics over and over: &quot;I'm an effigy, a parody, of who I appear to be/ put your flaming torches under me.&quot; Spooky, and very different from the other songs on this album.<br />THE LIVING: A very sad song about a man contemplating suicide (&quot;And I don't stand a chance with the living.&quot;). It's also the shortest song on the album at2:30. I love songs of this length- my favorite Tori Amos song, &quot;Josephine&quot; is also about two and half minutes. In short, &quot;The Living&quot; leaves you wanting more. <br />WHEN THEY RING THE GOLDEN BELLS: Judging from the rave reviews of her current CD, &quot;The House Carpenter's Daughter,&quot; people think that covers are what Natalie does best. This is a cover of an 1880's hymn, and is very beautiful, and features a wonderful guest vocalist. The tone of this song is much more upbeat than the tone of the rest of the songs on this CD.<br />OPHELIA REPRISE: This ten-minute instrumental masterpiece is at once low key and spectacular, leaving you time to contemplate the eleven wonderful songs you just heard!<br />If you are a human being buy this album! It will enrich your life and change you for the better
0141439807|1.0|I found when reading this book the story strayed from it's main character, Fanny, and went on for several pages, and sometimes entire chapters, about points which are irrelevant to the story. I also found the writer using excessively long sentances, and drawing out passages which could have easily been put in many less words.<br />I also found that the story seemingly goes nowhere. There is little or no character change, and there really is no conflict in the story line.<br />So if you want a dro pdead boring story with no action whatsoever, read on, dear reader, read on.
B00000JLWW|5.0|Ever since I was a little kid I read every book I could find on the Titanic. So I was waiting for this movie for a long time and was extremly dissappointed to find out that it was going to be made into a love story.<BR>  Titanic isn't the best film ever made but it's pretty close. The film offers something for everyone. For the guys it'a a top notch disaster film and there is female nudity. For girls there is the love story and Leo. The cast, with the exception of Billy Zane (as Cal)is superb. The music, special effects and especially the sets are amazing. The movie won eleven Oscars including best picture they don't just hand those out to anyone except to Chicago which sucked. Give Titanic a chance its worth your time.
B00006BTCA|5.0|In a world full of whiny love-starved emo brats and pop punk peddlers stands interpol slumped in the corner gazing at their fickle competition with their neo-prog and indie rock buddies.  This is a band who went on 'Pepsi Smash' (on a night when Michelle Branch, Simple Plan, and Chingy shared the bill) and screamed \\"AND YOU'LL GO STABBING YOURSELF IN THE NECK\\" to teeming masses of overprivaleged moron trl-watching teenage bokanovsky elipson minuses.  Their music is an eclictic blend of progressive rock in the tradition of Pink Floyd and King Crimson and droning postpunk similar to that of Joy Division  that fits in nicely between the Strokes and Radiohead. Interpol could save the world, provided MTV2 and the radio let us listen.
078322804X|4.0|When I heard that Blues Brothers was part musical/part comedy I was a bit skeptical about it because I am not a fan of musical movies.  Much to my surprise, Blues Brothers turned out to be a great movie with humor, good music, and shows some of the best car chases that I have seen to this day! The Blues Brothers are on a mission from a Nun to collect money for a good cause even though one has served time in prison, the other has a suspended drivers license while still breaking traffic laws, and both end up getting pursued by the police throughout the movie. Though the restored footage on the extended DVD version is a little slow paced at the beginning, the Blues Brothers is a classic that is sure to entertain. (rated R for some profanity)
B000005S0E|5.0|What is wrong with rozzy 1334 and Max from Toronto? The Top is a true masterpiece. Even if Piggy in the Mirror was the only song on it, it would still be a masterpiece album. Actually, Birdmad Girl is my fav from the Top. It is unique. Like circus music meets a really sick kind of metal. The sound is soooo clean and crisp. Songs like Piggy and Birdmad are mixed to be played very loud. Similar in mix to everything on Faith- the songs sound better the louder they are. The Top is very similar to Wild Mood Swings and Japanese whispers in the sense that they are not epics albums. They are more like oscurity collections without a main theme. However, these three are very, very good albums. Japanese Whispers spawned some of the band's greatest hits, at least 3. The Upstairs Room, one of the most lovely songs ever written was also on Japanese Whispers. So rozzy, you wher just kidding about the Top and JW being bad, right?
B00005LC4B|5.0|Robert De Niro's best performance is his terrifying portrayal of vicious psycho Max Cady, hell-bent on vengeance on his lawyer, Sam Bowden (played by Nick Nolte) who didn't defend him as well as he should of during a rape case. De Niro is clearly playing the part with as much relish as possible. His Southern accent, chilling laugh, Biblical tattoos, and the violent actions he brings to screen make him one of the most memorable villains in cinema. Not only that, but he is a believable one too, not too over-the-top. He's insane near the end, yes, but he is realistic. Nick Nolte gives a fairly good performance to Sam Bowden, Jessica Lange is good as Leigh, and Juliette Lewis gives a remarkable performance as Danielle Bowden, the emotionally-tortured teenage daughter of Sam and Leigh. The way the film uses seduction and betrayal as major themes is a key element. Director Martin Scorsese gives this film a classic horror feeling, paying special homage to the 1962 original by having Robert Mitchum, Gregory Peck, and Martin Balsam (all in the original) play cameo roles in this box-office remake. Not to mention, Scorsese wisely chose the same eerie score from the original film. This is a wonderful film, and it is horrifying. There is some graphic violence that is quite disturbing (particularly the scene in which Cady mutilates a woman in her apartment), but if that doesn't bother you, than you'll love this film. If you enjoy clever, intellectual psychological thrillers with LOTS of suspense, you'll love &quot;Cape Fear&quot;.
0743455967|3.0|You have to commend Stephen King for getting right to the point. As one of the best-selling (and most-read) writers in history, everyone wants to know: How do you DO it, Steve? How do you write so many books that so many people love?<br />Unfortunately, the advice he offers is the kind you can get just about anywhere. He doesn't tap into the special way HE writes. Instead, he tells you to &quot;show don't tell,&quot; keep it simple and clear, and don't over-write. I'd much rather find out how he comes up with ideas, how the strings his plots together, and what goes on in his head as he's working out the events of the story. (Why does this character die and not that one? How do you reveal a good villain to maintain suspense?) He touches on these topics,  but he doesn't get into them in depth.<br />The final section of the book stands apart from the rest. All of a sudden, he's writing about being hit by a car while walking down the road. He writes about drug abuse and trying to get back on his feet, physically and emotionally. This section is very good. King dives into autobiography with both feet, using his considerable skill at pacing and description to keep you on the edge of your seat about deeply personal matters.<br />If you want to try writing novels and short stories, this book will help you get it right. If you're a King fan, you'll get this book done in a day. For the rest of you, just flip to the final section and you'll be pleased.
B00005JKDQ|5.0|Monsters, Inc comes as the fourth film by the wonderful people at Pixar Animation Studios. This movie is a hilarious and lighthearted comedy for the whole family to laugh at!<BR>John Goodman and Billy Crystal provide voices for the lead characters, and Crystal is especially good as Mike, a little loser who lives for the chance to earn the 'scare record' with partner Scully at Monsters Incorporated.<BR>The superior quality of animation developed at Pixar cannot be emphasised enough, with flawless video quality from start to finish. The child in the film, known affectionately as Boo, is incredibly cute and irresistebly funny.<BR>A wonderful film, more than worth its weight in gold, and a must have for every collection!
B00005JM8V|4.0|Watching the 9.5 hour documentary Shoah one goes through a plethora or emotions: sadness, anger and finally triumph. Shoah is living history one that we will no likely to be able to repeat as time goes on.<br />Claude Lanzmann gives us a history of the Holocaust from the point of view of the participants. The survivors, the guards, the townspeople who witnessed the Final Solution firsthand. The thing that makes the film amazing is that we do not see the grisly images that were so prevalent in films like Renais Night and Fog. We simply hear voices and see faces.<br />The interview technique is what makes this film so important. We are forced to look into these people's faces as they tell their stories. And they do have important stories to tell. Also we literally visit the places of destruction as they are now. We see green meadows that were once killing grounds like Sobibor or Chelmno. We see the village of Grabow now reduced of its Jewish population; we bear witness to the railside horrors of Treblinka, and the haunting desolation that was and is Auschwitz.<br />The startling thing is that the people of the film have been able to rebuild their lives and go on. This is the triumph of the film. We hear horrible things to be sure but these people are true survivors.<br />The DVD does not offer many extras, but then not many are needed. The end result is a sort of numb silence and this prevades the viewing. The transfer could have been a little clearer but I feel that this was more of a flaw in the source footage than a problem in the DVD creation. The only real problem with my set was on the fourth disc where there were numerous sound fall outs. <br />All in all Shoah is not an easy film to watch. It takes patience and careful listening if one is to truly understand but it should be regarded as essential viewing for any would be student of history.
B00006SFBD|5.0|how can i start with such great work i really hade no idea who this band was but then i found this cd and it just rock every song is great not one bad song all have own style just all in all one of the best metal cds every down so pick this on up today you will love it and listen to it all the time you will see
B00000ADG2|2.0|I am baffled as to what people love about this CD. Lauryn Hill's image is great, but her music is below mediocre. And it's boring. Just because you have a positive message doesn't make you a good musician. There is no funk. The beats suck. That Thing is one of the most irritating songs I've ever heard. Seriously, people... You need to think for yourselves. This album is all hype and no substance. Oh, and comparing her to Marvin Gaye is just a crime. The Fugees are great, but don't be mislead. If you value funk at all, don't buy this CD. I gave it 2 stars for the positive message, but the music deserves a 1.
0553277472|4.0|Pirsig takes us on a literary chautauqua that dives into the split between romanticism and clasicism, and speaks magnitudes about the philosiphies and sciences of Eastern and Western Cultures. The book has seized rave reviews across the globe, and held best-seller status for record amounts of time.  One wonders, what could possibly be in this book that has made it so accredited for such a long time?  The answer is that the book takes the reader on a journey that was never supposed to happen.  Pirsig elucidates, in four hundred pages, about the conflicts with his son, and himself.  Phaedrus, Pirsig's former personality, is represented as a ghost from Pirsig's past. Phaedrus takes the reader through Greek logic, Eastern culture, and Buddhist beliefs.  The book gives a good explanation of the differences in Eastern and Western cultures, and how the splitting of the two has caused problems throughout the world. <BR>     Coming from a background of the dry sciences, my reading of classical literature is hardly amazing.  These two topics do not go together and rarely have anything to bridge the gap.  This book does that job wonderfully.  For the first time, I understood literature of this complexity, because it deals with the sciences and the arts; it kept me interested and also made me relate my life to the characters lives. <BR>     So, what do I suggest? If you have the time, the patience, and an open mind, this book will do you wonders and will stick with you for years to come.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|when i first read everyone elses reviews and they were saying how they could actually &quot;see&quot; parts of the movie i was like &quot;ummm ok.....weeeeiiirrrdoooo&quot; but when i bought this and listened to it i found that they were right! especially during song #2, the medallion calls.  it is perfect for presenting captain jack sparrow standing on the mast of his boat. (well actually its not his boat, it is the jolly mon which he &quot;borrowed&quot; from anamaria.) and this is a really good cd.  in my opinion, klaus badelt is a brilliant composer, and even people who don't particularly like classical music (like me) will love this!
B00000JNO2|4.0|In many circles, Gimmee Back My Bullets is not thought of as a prime time Lynyrd Skynyrd record.  Nonetheless, there are many good songs on this somewhat overlooked collection.<br />Whereas, Gimmee Back My Bullets does not expand very much on the original Lynyrd Skynyrd sound, it features more ear friendly tunes than the tired sounding Nuthin' Fancy.  The title track is one excellent piece of music as the lyrics cut right to the bone.  The guitar sound on this great song is oh so gritty and the drums just &quot;Run All Over You&quot;.  Cry For The Bad Man is another gem as its poignant lyrics make you actually understand the shoes an outlaw walks in.  Nice background vocals by the Honkettes on here.<br />Both Trust and All I Can Do Is Write About It show a gentle acoustic side of Lynyrd Skynyrd. Whereas neither of these tunes rank up there with the outstanding Ballad Of Curtis Loewe from the Second Helping Release, there are some pretty moments which include the touching lyrics of Trust and the piano solo on the later mentioned tune.<br />Without a doubt, Gimmee Back My Bullets is an underatted  record that is a worthy addition to your Lynyrd Skynyrd collection.  You just might want to pick up Second Helping and Street Survivors first.
B00000JZC4|4.0|The single that got me into this band was &quot;Take a Picture&quot;. The song was very soft and nice and calm; At the time, I wasn't much into heavy rock, nor did I know that Filter did that style. Even so, I loved the album, and since then, I've loved the style. Here's an in-depth look at all the songs from my point of view.<br />Sand: An un-reviewable track, for it is instrumental, and about thirty seconds long. I think of it as an intro to the following track:<br />Welcome to the Fold: At first, this was the only track I listened to, because I loved it so much. Nice and heavy, although the guitar in the verses is a bit repetitive. <br />Captain Bligh: After I listened to the entire CD, this became my 2nd favorite track. I love the opening drum beat, and the opening guitar is AWESOME!<br />It's Gonna Kill Me: WOW! This is a really great song! I love how it starts off with some soft bass, then Richard Patrick comes in with a nice long scream, and the drum picks up. It also has a great sounding chorus.<br />The Best Things: I really like this track a lot. I think it's a nice, sorta heavy track with a chorus better than the latter track.<br />Take a Picture: Great track. It would have to be, right, to get me into this group?<br />Skinny: This is my favorite track on this album. It has cool lyrics, and a great tune.<br />I Will Lead You: This is tied with &quot;Skinny&quot; for my favorite track. Great heavy guitar opening, great vocals, perfect chorus, and great vocal tune. I especially love the guitar when Rick is singing &quot;'Cuz I'm a lie&quot;.<br />Cancer: The thing I love about this track is Rick's hoarse, whispery, demonic voice. I also love the tune of the opening vocals. And who doesn't love the swooning chorus in the background?<BR>I think it's sooo cool also when patrick is saying what he is- &quot;I'm the Scum of the Earth, I'm a cancer, I am humanity&quot;.<br />I'm Not the Only One: I appreciate that Filter has provided us with two cool-down songs; this and the next. This is a nice song, and surprisingly calm, until near the end. Every band should have a song like this. I especially like that if you listen really closely, you can hear a cool high-pitched noise. This reminds me of &quot;Stuck In Here&quot; from their previous album, &quot;Short Bus&quot;. <br />Miss Blue: A pretty, accoustic song with a simple vocal tune that I totally dig.<br />Also, if you fast forward the track far enough, you hear Rick saying how much fans love him, then there is a lot of screaming. This is the only reason the album runs over an hour; Because of the space between &quot;Miss Blue&quot; and the secret (I guess you could call it a track).<br />I gave this album a star less than perfect because, well it's a great album and all, but I think they have potential to do much better. No matter how good this is, I still think (if possible, and it is) they could do better! Still a great album, though.
B000089RVX|2.0|Evanescence is NOT original. For proof listen to Linkin Park, Lacuna Coil, Nightwish, Lullacry and the Gathering. They have different things that Evanescence took. Evanescence is just a mix of them with some pop. I must admit there are a few good tunes like Going Under and Bring Me To Life but the rest of the songs are all boring and bland - the lyrics are really bad. (I looked them up and realized some of it doesn't make sense)Amy Lee has a \\"strong\\" voice but it sounds terrible and I'm not going to say anything about her \\"prettyness\\" because some people can't help that but what she can help is how she dresses and how she denies shes \\"goth\\". That is terrible. Do not buy this CD it is garbage. The occasional person might enjoy there songs but I ask of you to listen to Linkin Park, Lacuna Coil, Nightwish, The Gathering and Lullacry and then you can see what I mean. :)<br />Song Reviews:<br />Going Under: When you first hear this song it draws your attention and gets stuck in your head for the rest of the day. The beats are good, and the music is pretty outstanding. The song is about being pulled down (or going under) into something you don't want to. Which can probably speak for most of us, but some of the phrases in this song doesn't fit with the message. Either way, not a bad song. 4/5<br />Bring Me To Life: This is the song that got most of you hooked on Evanescence. Amy Lee's voice actually doesn't sound that bad in this song. So when you hear this song your probably thinking \\"Wow, she has so much talent.\\" and I'm not saying she doesn't because after hearing this song I was convinced she had a beautiful voice. (Just wait till you hear the other songs) the rapping does not spoil this song, it sort of fits in but Amy Lee and Paul McCoy did a pretty good job. 4/5<br />Everybodys Fool: An interesting song. \\"More lies about a world that Never was and never will be have you no shame don't you see me you know you've got everybody fooled\\" I wonder what that means. Peoplewho like Evanescence will now say, \\"I know what it means.\\" I could figure it out, myself, but the way the words are peiced togethar upsets me. The first sentance states that there are more lies about a world that never was and never will be. I get that. But then it asks \\"dont you see me\\" and then says \\"you know you've got everybody fooled\\" OK. That just sounds siller every time I read it! 2/5<br />Haunted: This song has a really good beat and is a bit scary. However, when you hear Amy Lee's voice it will definetly scare you. The first couple of lines are defeaning. And heres another funny line in the lyrics, \\"hunting you i can smell you - alive\\" I felt ashamed when I looked up the lyrics. Not only is the guitar annoying at the end - I think that they should have let Amy Lee have this one with a few good instruments that actually fit in nicely. I just wish Amy Lee wouldn't have screamed into the microphone. The lyrics are stupid and the beat was so good too! Its a shame they wasted in on this ... 3/5 (the 3 for a good beat).<br />Tourniquet: \\"A device, typically a tightly encircling bandage, used to check bleeding by temporarily stopping the flow of blood through a large artery in a limb.\\" As soon as I heard this song I looked up the meaning of a tourniquet. This song is one I hate. The lyrics are all about suicide and death. So if you want to get yourself in a bad mood and make yourself depressed go ahead and listen. Otherwise, stick to another song (or even better, another band.) \\"Music To Slit your Wrists to!!\\" 1/5<br />Imaginery: Its alright. This song sounds as if when it was wrote the people were drunk. Just check this out, \\"Monsters calling my name Let me stay\\" Okay, thats enough for me to realize this song was pretty bad. I don't know what else to say. I guess next time I see Amy Lee i'll ask her what the songs about ... I wonder what she'll say. 2/5<br />Taking Over Me: Another song that sounds too similar to the others. The difference is that the same wordsare put togetahr and mixed up making few sense but still drawing everyones attention. One day, all of you should go and amuse yourselves by reading the lyrics to the songs. (I have a few songs to go, because every time I read a songs lyrics I burst out laughing.) Ha ha ha. The song is sad. 1/5<br />Hello: The lyrics are so short, that I realized they ran out of ideas of what stuff to write about in their songs! I wonder what theyre going to do in their next album? (A mystery to me.) The song is alright. Not as bad as Tournequit (or however the spelling was, Im frankly too tired to spell properly.) 3/5<br />My Last Breath: For some reason this song reminds me of \\"Taking Over Me\\" and most of the other songs on the album. Horrid, really. The songs are all similar (As was mentioned earlier.) Pretty sad. \\"My last Breath ... Please dont sing...\\" oops, I'm being cruel. 1/5<br />Whisper: I don't see what the fuss is about with this song. Everyone says its so good. But really its just like the others. Don't waste your time with this song, but really you should I guess becuse everyone seems to absolutely adore it. This is another mystery to me. 2/5<br />Overall: I've heard worse but seen so much better. It was OK but really not good. ... So go and tick \\"no\\" if your a 14 (or teen. whatever) year old trying to be cool by listening to death. Go on. And tick \\"Yes\\" if you have a brain. <br />A Quick Note: Amy Lee (the lead singer) tries to hit notes that she cannot reach. I do understand that practice makes perfect but does she really need to put her screeching and screaming onto a CD? Some singing lessons is needed, not saying she doesn't have talent but she is hiding it and not showing it with all this screaming trying to sound like \\"Christina Aguilera\\" when, lets face in, Christina was born singing like an angel. Most of the others have to work hard, sorry to dissapoint you Amy.
B000002TPS|3.0|this cd is even more stripped down than &quot;countdown to extinction,&quot; which still had solos. Aside from &quot;a toute le monde,&quot; &quot;train of consequences,&quot; and &quot;Reckoning day&quot; this album is completely watered down megadeth. mustaine himself has even admitted that he was dissatisfied with the production; he said the songs that should have been slow ended up fast and vice versa. the only other megadeth album worse than this is &quot;Risk,&quot; which I still love, because anything Mustaine puts out I know I'll like it. Buy &quot;Rust in Peace&quot;
B00005JLEX|5.0|I've been waiting for this for way too long.  If it doesn't get released now, I don't think I'll ever feel the same again...do the companies not realize how much money this set could make them?  Everybody loves this show, and everybody wants to own it.  It's Seinfeld.  Is there any other reason to own it?
B00003CXBK|5.0|This DVD was the first time I saw a &quot;real&quot; anime, probably about when it came out. By &quot;Real&quot; I mean that it isn't about people play card games, raising kiddy monsters, or getting so constipated that your hair turns yellow. This was the first anime I saw that showed me what anime was really like. Anime doesn't have to be bad plots and animation. It can be awesome animation and stunning plots that can make you watch it again and again. If you are a Yugioh, Pokemon, Dragonball (especially), etc. fan, then get this DVD and make a bag of popcorn, because this will make you realize how great anime can be.
B000002H2H|5.0|This CD is one of the greatest metallica cds i have ever heard, it brings the thrill of metal and black metal together with hits like for whom the bell tolls, creeping death, and such. I also Believe that Ride the Lighting song is one of the best trash metal singles. Fade to black is also an awesome song, rather then being one of the heavy songs, it still impacts u with good notes, good lyrics and good guitaring.
B00003CWL6|5.0|It's simply one of the best films ever made.  If you haven't seen it then you certainly should.
6305252521|5.0|It's something we guard more often than anything: privacy. This along with your family is the most guarded thing you'll find, unless you're some nutcase who has to tell every single thing of their life for the fun of it. What if your most personal and traumatic moments were caught on tape for someone to see? What if the entire world saw?  That's the basic concept of this film which might be prophetic in the near future.<br />Truman Burbank leads a rather ordinary life: beautiful wife, normal home, good job, a caring best friend and a quiet town.  Until strange things start to happen: spotlights fall from the sky, elevators that aren't elevators, and an even a strange encounter with his supposed deceased father.  Slowly Truman starts to uncover the truth: his life is a fabrication, his friends and his wife actors and his town is a set and Truman's quest to break free and return to the only woman who actually loves him.<br />Acting? Top notch. Jim Carrey does get a chance to act nuts but there's also drama and you can see he's more than a rather goofy actor. Ed Harris plays kind of a duel role: the creator of the show with Truman's best interests at heart but also an almost strict forcing(you'll see this at the end). But honors go to Laura Linney. She plays that nice suburban housewife so well: one of my favorite scenes is when Truman looks like he's having a nervous breakdown and she has a sympathizing expression then she turns right around and does an obvious product placement ad. Versatile woman<br />Sadly the only thing people really talked about in this movie was Jim Carrey's breaks into drama but this could make you paranoid as well: what if Big Brother and the world as well is watching?
B00005N5S5|4.0|(Instead of reviewing a film you probably already know, I stick to DVD special features)<br />Those Extras:<br />Commentary:  NONE!  Yikes.<br />Deleted Scenes:  Now this is a bit odd.  They couldn't get Cameron to sit down for a full-length commentary, but he has time to do one for the cut scenes??  Whatever.  Anyway, they're nothing special, unless you're a diehard desperate for something new to chew on.<br />Documentary:  Two actually.  Covers everything you'd want to know about the film, and then some, as it actually runs on a little too long.<br />Overall:  Though only a couple of big features, they're so extensive that you still get your moneys worth.  The absence of higher than thou Cameron for a running commentary (c'mon, at least get Gale Ann Hurd!), plus outtakes and an on-set making of, cause this to fall short of greatness.
0805062971|5.0|Excellent read if you have a dark sense of humor - this is one of the few books I've read that's made me laugh out loud from the satirical and non sequiturish dialogue and proclamations of Tyler Durden. Anyone who's just graduated from university and about to enter the corporate working world should read this and second guess some of their work values. Not that's meant to be some kind of self-help or &quot;values&quot; book (despite the number of real underground fight clubs that have popped up) - it's more of a book about amoralism and anarchism, and a darned entertaining one at that. Plus I learned a lot about making soap.
0792846443|3.0|(Instead of reviewing a film you probably know, I stick to special features of the DVD)<br />(THIS REFERS TO THE UK VERSION)<br />Those extras:<br />Commentary:  Fair.  Reiner, who I've heard a few times now, really needs to work on this.  Far, far too many lapses where he disappears.  Another track features an arrogant Goldman bashing directors for having no imagination and praising---hell, overpraising---his writing abilities.  At one point he even pauses for a few moments then chimes in, &quot;Sorry, this dialogue is just so well written&quot;.<br />New Interviews:  Pretty much picture perfect.  Not just Caan, Bates, Reiner, and Goldman, but DP Sonnenfeld, and even Sternhagen.  Interesting stories from the set and years later.<br />Overall:  Just those couple of things to get excited about.  A lack of behind the scenes stuff, deleted scenes, outtakes, et al, don't make this a must buy unless you just want to own the film.
B000002L82|5.0|Let me just clear something up: New Order are not, nor have they ever been, a new wave synth-pop band.  Their music inspired a lot of  it, yes, and their most famous songs ('Bizarre Love Triangle', 'Blue Monday') were synth pop but the timelessness, power, emotion and innovation of their music has them being recognized now as easily one of the most respected, influential and popular bands of all time.  Too much to be lumped in with some trendy garbage of the era.  Their albums are modern classics.<br />It's too bad the sleeve for this album lost its magic in translation to cd format.  The vinyl version of this album is stunning.<br />The music catches them wanting to ditch the heavy, stylized gloom of their Joy Division work and 'Movement'.  Yet, they hadn't fully committed to making flat-out pop music like on every subsequent release.  So every song bubbles with the sound of a psychedelic post-punk band with subtle programming echoing the New York City hip-hop and electro at the time.  The lyrics are borderline incomprehensible, but they work because against the odds they evoke strong emotions, more so then on any other New Order album.    The music is still overwhelmingly sad and joyous at the same time, a New Order trademark.  <br />There are two very different versions of this album.  The U.S. Warner release includes 'Blue Monday' and 'The Beach'.  My problem with this version is that after the song 'Leave Me Alone' the album should just end, it's a natural and beautiful ending for the album, instead it jumps into a bouncy 7-minute electro workout 'The Beach'.  It's just wrong!
B00004TDTO|5.0|White Death, Great White Terror and Man-Eater are all names that have entered public vocabulary to describe the Great White Shark, one of the most efficient predators of the oceans.<BR>Yet, surprisingly, only very few people have actually encountered one, and fewer still had had the misfortune of been attacked by one, yet why is it that the name alone is enough to strike terror in our hearts and inspire awe and fascination? <BR>The answer is simple,Peter Benchley and Steven Spielberg.<BR>The collaboration of a best selling author and a director at his creative best resulted in one of the all time classics of cinema, an original film that has spawned dozens of imitations, and one responsible for keeping a lot of viewers out of the waters for a while, afraid of Jaws.<BR>The success of Jaws is due to many factors, all as important: <BR>The direction of Steven Spielberg is flawless, pushing the right buttons at every turn, starting with one of the best ever opening scenes in cinema history, then keeping the suspense brewing till amazingly appx. the 81st minute before the shark shows its toothy grin! The fact that this 'monster' was unseen for the largest part of the movie was a genuis decision from Spielberg and contributed to tickling our imagination, and increasing the tension.<BR>The acting was another factor to Jaws's success, <BR>Spielberg could not have chosen to cast better actors for his film:<BR>Roy Scheider,the reluctant hero Chief Brody,<BR>Lorraine Gary,the supportive and concerned wife that adds a needed comforting and homely feeling to the film, <BR>Richard Dreyfuss, the scientist that mixes a sense of  scientific and logical direction with a much appreciated humour,<BR>and of course, the great Robert Shaw,( interestingly not Spielberg first choice, as he wanted Lee Marvin or Burgess Meredith).<BR>It is by sheer good luck that Marvin and Meredith declined to take this role for varying reasons, for in my opinion no one could have played the experienced, weary and tough fisherman Quint better than Robert Shaw. You just have to listen to his speech about the 1945 Indianapolis shark attacks to know what I am talking about,it is one of the most chilling scenes ever filmed.<BR>The success of Jaws is also due to the soundtrack.<BR>Surely the musical themes of films like The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, Godfather and Dr Zhivago are instantly recognizable classics the world over, but John Williams score is in a league of its own.<BR>It is an integral part of the movie, as if a character in its own right. The opening strings are not only an accompanying or background tune, but the shark itself!! It gives life to the animal/character like no other music managed to do before or after.<BR>Another element of success lies in the fact that Benchely's book touched a very interesting and sensitive nerve: Monsters that prey on humans.This has always fascinated and scared people since the dawn of history, and many books and tales have imagined countless such monsters in the oceans,mountains or jungles.The fact that people are vulnerable to another predator in an environment they do not or can not tame, have always  been a source of fascination and fear.<BR>Of course, the Great White has had a very bad PR because of Jaws, (in reality the Bull and Tiger sharks are far more responsible for attacks on humans than the Great White) something author Benchley has tried to correct years later.But while science has increasingly blown away most of the myths that surrounded this animal for too long, still that name alone and that music will forever give us a cold chill down our spine,look at the ocean with slight aversion, for somewhere down there surely lurks Jaws.<BR>And this is exclusively  due to the success of the film and the creative genuis behind it,Steven Spielberg.
B00006LIRI|2.0|U2 are like nails on a blackboard.  <br />There is nothing original or interesting in their music since they started ripping off American blues-rock to appeal to the US market.  They wrote some amazing tunes in their early days, but even then they were a watered-down Joy Division ripoff.  The Edge's 'unique' guitar work is a blatant ripoff of the choppy, melodic rythm guitar of Joy Division/New Order.  The driving, military-esque drums are a blatant ripoff of Joy Division/New Order.  When they realized they could tap into the mass US market by pretending to be classic rock blues they totally changed their sound.  Then in the nineties when their brand of earnest classic rock became untrendy, guess what?  They started ripping off the then trendy club scene, even though in the eighties they poo-poohed dance music as unworhty. <br />Of course, nothing is truly original.  Everything is influenced by something else.  But U2 stand out by being completely unoriginal; cynical in their posturing as 'sincere, serious artists' when really they're fake sell-outs who will change everthing they're about to stay trendy.   <br />Everything they've done since the mid-eighties has been calculated appropriation and marketing.  Now they're just bloated and bland.

B000094HLA|5.0|I have several versions of the Goldberg Variations, and this one is ideally suited to the CD era.  Just look at the length of it, for a start: 71.11 minutes.  Of the others, Glenn Gould's first recording came in at an extraordinary 38.24 mins, but this was pushing the limit of what a 1950s LP could handle.  Glenn Gould's second version, releaseed just after his death in the early 1980s, was 51.20 mins long.  My least favourite version, on Naxos by Pi-hsien, is 55.08 minutes of muffled, murky piano-playing.<br />Andras Schiff performed this new version two years ago in front of an exceptionally silent audience in Basel.  (No-one appears to cough or fidget at all -- only once in the entire concert did I detect someone dropping something.)  The recording certainly has the ambience of the concert hall, but there's not even any applause at the end of the recital.  (Contrast this with, say, another ECM label pianist, Keith Jarrett, performing live, where the audience behaves in almost the opposite manner.)<br />Clearly there is not the sound of each page of music being turned over.  I am so new to piano-playing that I am still in awe of anyone who can keep so much music in his head.  (That's one of the advantages of recording in the studio!)<br />As usual with ECM CDs, the packaging is immaculate: detailed notes by Schiff himself, who first recorded this work 20 years ago, and even an acrostic poem on his name by Vikram Seth, author of 'A Suitable Boy'.<br />Will this CD usurp any of the affection I have for both the Glenn Gould versions?  No, they will continue to find a regular place in my CD player -- I just love their eccentricities, and I find their relative brevity easier to cope with.  71 minutes is almost too much music for my mind to handle, but this is a fantastic version.  There is none of the mumbled singing that accompanies a Gould or Jarrett piano recording, and I'll just have to get used to the idea that maybe JSB didn't intend a vocal track when he composed the Goldbergs.d the Goldbergs.

B0000524E5|3.0|A decent but disappointing flick. It disappoints because it is definitely not as advertised. From the commercials, you'd think you're going to see a movie about a bar with outrageous female bartenders. The movie is actually about Violet who moves from Jersey to New York to become a song writer. After a burglary, she's broke and gets a job at the bar Coyote Ugly. You get occasional glimpses at the girls dancing on the bar and flinging water, drinks, and ice on their customers. Other than Violet, the other women at the bar aren't featured. You learn nothing about them. And if you're a Tyra Banks fan, don't bother watching this movie. She's on screen about ten minutes. That's a generous estimate. Mostly the movie is about Violet's attempts to get her music heard. It's sweet but not unique. The DVD has deleted scenes. Probably only one of them should have been saved. I would have given it four stars if I hadn't been so disappointed.

0316926345|1.0|The story begins with Charles Ryder being in the army during in world war two. He comes across the estate of his old friend, Sebastian Flyte during the war and it stirs up his old memories and that's where the story actually starts because that whole first chapter, you must understand, is entirely boring. The novel is sort of told in flashback mode by Ryder who befriends Sebastian during his college years after meeting him in a contrived way (throwing up in Ryder's room) and that of course, brings about events that would never ever happen (a guy sending a fellow he barely knows a room full of flowers and inviting him to have lunch with his friends) in real life. Sebastian carries around a teddybear that is a gimmick the writer uses to make people remember Sebastian is \\"different\\" from the the rest of the people in the story. Besides the teddybear, Sebastian does very little else to distinguish himself between him and the rest of the people in this story but then half way threw it, he goes from guy who drinks for fun (Charles and Sebastain skip away and get drunk alot) to big just a pathetic drunk. So, I guess he was given TWO chacterstics then, lol. There's another fellow in the story called Anthony Blanche but he's barely worth mentioning but he's big gimmick is stuttering and after a while, it becomes so tiresome and awful. I couldn't wait for that him to be written out. He's supposed to be rather openly homosexual but Charles and Sebastian's relationship is written as more of sort of friendship with hints of homosexuality. It's really left up to the reader's imagination or what you want to believe. So anyway, Sebastian hates his family but he keeps dragging Charles back to his big rich castle home until he eventually encounters them, first sort of as individuals and later as almost a whole family except for Sebastian's dad who left the family and lives with another woman. Sebastian acts like a baby when he gets around his family and worries they'll steal Charlesaway from him but then he locks himself up in his room and drinks so Charles has little choice but get to socialize with them. Eventually, their 'friendship' falls apart and Charles falls for Sebastian's sister. After their 'friendship' dissolved, sebastian disappears and is only briefly mentioned and I found the novel got pretty dull after that and it was a struggle to finish. The final outcome of it all left alot to be desired to. I don't recomend it.
B000068MKZ|5.0|The lyrics to her songs are witty, poetic and uplifting.  Playing the guitar herself, Carla Bruni makes a surprising debut into a successful singing career.

0743243153|5.0|&quot;The Road Less Travelled&quot; is a book about non-conformity - being brave enough to admit that your life isn't going as well as you think it is, and finding your own path towards the truth, love, and perhaps even God.  Most people with even the most modest amount of self-awareness go through a stage whereby they challenge their own/parents/friends/societies beliefs and start to look for answers.  Few however, truly do change; instead they resign themselves to a mediocre existence of habitual worship (to God or to money) and habitual love.  This book's message is clear: do not to give up so easily, keep on searching!<br />At the time M. Scott Peck wrote the book, a main area of interest to him was Zen Buddhism, which fundamentally deals with the fact that our desires cause suffering (see &quot;The Four Noble Truths of the Buddha&quot;).  As a consequence of this, the book is a mixture of his own brand of psychology and psychotherapy (think along the lines of C.G. Jung), Eastern philosophy with a dash of Christianity thrown in for good measure.  Peck's questions and ideas are nothing new, however, he skilfully relates his own professional experiences with patients to exemplify the importance of self-understanding, so that we might break free from our suffering.  As part of this, Peck obliges us to examine the fundamental questions of our existence - what is the real nature of love? Is there any order to the universe? What is the meaning of life itself? Peck never directly gives us the answers, but does ask the questions and offers up his own theories. <br />&quot;The Road Less Travelled&quot; is a good book for those searching for some truth in their life, and one that I think everyone should read at least once.  After this however, Peck clearly forgot his own advice.  He became a &quot;Born Again&quot;, started up a foundation, and gave several lectures on psychology, life, and his love of Jesus (see &quot;Further Along the Road Less Travelled&quot;).  I am not saying there's anything wrong with choosing a religion, though in my experience you develop a tunnel vision on things, which is clearly what happened of Peck.  Still, &quot;The Road Less Travelled&quot; comes recommended to everyone, just realise that Peck doesn't have all the answers.
B0000C9V3T|4.0|Since we have quite a wait for the DVD (as of this writing), the best way to experience some of our favorite moments from KILL BILL at home is to get this CD. The opening song performed by Nancy Sinatra is here, along with Luis Bacalov's &quot;The Grand Duel&quot; theme, heard in the film during the animated &quot;Origin of O-Ren&quot; chapter. Bernard Herrmann's &quot;Twisted Nerve&quot; is here (begun in the film as the tune Daryl Hannah whistles in the hospital corridor). Al Hirt's rendition of &quot;Flight of the Bumblebee,&quot; better known as the theme from &quot;The Green Hornet,&quot; is on board (heard in the film accompanying the Bride's flight over Tokyo and arrival in Japan), as is Tomoyasu Hotei's &quot;Battle Without Honor or Humanity,&quot; the guitar riff and brass fanfare heard over the grand entrance of O-Ren and her party at the House of Blue Leaves (and used quite memorably in the film's first trailer). &quot;The Flower of Carnage,&quot; the theme song from LADY SNOWBLOOD (1973) sung by its star, Meiko Kaji, and heard in the film following the O-Ren/Bride sword duel, is on the CD as well.<br />Some great cues from the film are not on the CD or not presented as they were in the film. Missing in action is Ennio Morricone's memorable percussion-woodwind-and-vocal Italian western theme, &quot;Death Rides a Horse,&quot; heard as the Bride and O-Ren first confront each other in the House of Blue Leaves. Also missing is the Lily Chou-Chou number, &quot;Kaifuku Suru Kizu,&quot; the enchanting wordless vocal heard as the Bride gazes at the array of swords in Sonny Chiba's upstairs room. Only one number (&quot;Woo Hoo&quot;) of the three or so performed by the Japanese female pop trio, the 5.6.7.8's, in the House of Blue Leaves sequence is on the CD. The Latin-flavored instrumental number heard over the O-Ren/Bride duel and performed by Santa Esmeralda is suddenly a vocal rendition of &quot;Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood&quot; on the CD. &quot;Seven Notesin Black,&quot; heard during the Bride's ambush of the hospital orderly, is heard on the CD only under a rap song performed by the RZA, a number not heard in the film at all. (In fact, one wonders how the &quot;Original Music&quot; credit awarded to The RZA came about, since there doesn't seem to be any original music in the film.) <br />It's clearly time for a number of record companies to get on the KILL BILL bandwagon and reissue soundtracks and recordings that contain music from KILL BILL with a tag slapped on saying, &quot;Featuring the music from KILL BILL.&quot; The first candidate would, of course, be Nancy Sinatra's 1966 album, &quot;How Does That Grab You?&quot; which contains the recording of &quot;Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)&quot; used for the opening credits of KILL BILL. All it needs now is a tag stating, &quot;Featuring the theme song from KILL BILL.&quot; The second and third candidates, of course, would be anything by the 5.6.7.8's and the fictional &quot;Lily Chou-Chou.&quot; Calling all imports!
B00005MNP8|5.0|Ah, 1979. Do you remember it? It was all happening then. Suddenlly out of no where came Heart of Glass what a tune. Next up One Way Or Another was gonna getcha. Robert Fripp contributed to this record on Fade Away And Radiate. The great thing about this album is definetly the production value stylings of Mike Chapman. Cool cover as well. Bonus tracks are allright although I missed the instrumental Of Heart Of Glass, with all those swooshes in the song. Anyways a must have in your music collection, put on those boogie shoes cause this record will make you want to dance (again ok!)
B000005IRG|5.0|For those who have never heard \\"Television\\" before and are contemplating purchasing it because it is a 'punk' classic, I give you warning. If you define punk by \\"the Sex Pistols\\" or hardcore bands such as \\"Bad Brains\\" or \\"Minor Threat\\" you might well be dissapointed by \\"Marquee Moon\\", or at least shocked. More purist punks wouldn't consider this to be punk at all. All the instruments are played with skill, the the vocals, while not great, are not spat out or snarled, and you odds are, unless they hate all rock music, your parents would probably like this record. <br />Coming from the CBGB's scene this album lends weight to the argument that New York punk and proto punk are a different genre like, 'British punk' or even 'hardcore'. Obviously inspired by art rock legends, \\"the Velvet Underground\\", this album is a mellow trip of 'inde' perfection. There is none of John Cale's infamous 'white noise' to be heard however, \\"Marquee Moon\\" is polished and clear. The title track does reflect 'Velvets' classics, such as 'Heroin' and to a lesser extent 'Sister Ray', and is as brilliant as any sixties garage band 'wig out' you'll ever hear. Other influences can be heard, as well, \\"Friction\\" evokes 'the Modern Lovers' sound, while else where snatches of \\"Radio Birdman' and even \\"the Stooges' can be heard. <br />\\"See No Evil\\" kicks off the album with a simple guitar chord, then a few seconds later a second guitar wraps its self around the chord like a finely spun spider web. The mood is light, and what is surely the most 'punk' element to \\"Television\\" Tom Velraine breathes out his bored with life vocals, making gags, and eschewing that 'whatever' attitude that would later become either loved or hate by different punk factions. <br />Unlike many punk acts from '77' (or even after) \\"Television\\" was just as much about the instruments and quality of the tunes, as the lyrics, attitude and posteuring. Infact this is in the relm of 'punk' almost a poplar opposite to 'Nevermind The Bollocks\\". There is rythm, intelligence, harmonised vocals. To be honest this isn't punk at all, influenced by the same music as some 'punk' definetly, but \\"Television\\" took as different path entirely, and because of that, in retrospect this is the best album of '77', and therefore among the best of all time.
B00005MNP7|5.0|Wow this is another power album from this super group. All the tracks are great. Classics like Dreaming, Atomic and Union City Blues are all here. Notably though Slow Motion could have been a single, hands down, no question. Bonus tracks on this album are live cuts of Bowie's Heroes and Ring Of Fire from the Roadie soundtack (remember Meatloaf?)Overall the rating on this album should be a 10.Only one real dissapointment though, it is too bad that North American audiences didn't appreciate it as much as Parallel Lines.
B00005JLKN|2.0|This is an almost word for word remake of the 1986 film \\"Manhunter.\\"  While watching this one I kept asking myself why.  Why did someone decide to remake a prefectly good film?  This remake adds nothing, in fact it is inferior to Manhunter in many ways.  Poor casting is just the beginning of the problem.  I never bought Anthony Hopkins as a psycho in any of these in the series.  In this one he plays it way over the top in an almost cartoonish manner.  Ed Norton does an OK job as Will Graham, but this role could have been done equally well by anyone.  Most annoying is Ralph Fiennes as the Tooth Fairy.  This guy sleepwalks through the role and is about as authentic as a wooden nickel.  The film concludes with a lame \\"he's not really dead\\" cliche.  This was the choice to make it different from Manhunter?  Silly.  Two stars for the always interesting Harvey Keitel.  Skip this one and rent the far superior Manhunter instead.
B00005J6T0|5.0|If there was ever a chart made of the top 100 albums of the 20th century this album would be in the top ten. The album &quot;True Blue&quot; is pure pop heaven. The album is very well crafted, with hits like &quot;Live to Tell&quot;, Papa Don't Preach&quot; and &quot;Open Your Heart&quot;. Classic music from a woman who knows her stuff, considering this was Madonna's 3rd foray into the chart making business. What is more is that if you notice, Madonna's look has totally changed on the cover of this album, gone are the crosses, bangles etc, They have been replaced with a sleeker, thinner woman who took on the world and won.
B00005JMC6|5.0|Whale Rider is a wonderful film. It captures the struggle of people at the edge of losing their distinct culture in a way that everyone can relate to.<br />The grandfather is very traditional, keeping alive the Maori legends and beliefs. However, his insistance that everything be as it always had been almost causes the community to become lost entirely. It is only the strength of soul in his granddaughter that rescues their history while, at the same time, taking it in a new direction.<br />The performances of all of the actors are noteworthy but it is Keisha Castle-Hughes (Pai) and Rawiri Paratene (Koro) who stand out the most.<br />So many times morals are banged over our heads but the messages in Whale Rider are much more subtle, despite being extremely powerful. There is no denial of the new way of doing things but a celebration of traditions and history.<br />This is definitely one of the best films I've seen.

I'm really happy to see both &quot;Bleecker Street&quot; and &quot;Sparrow&quot; from their debut finally on a collection. Both are great. A handful of songs are live, but most are the originals, and all sound good. If this 2-disc set is not in your budget, I would surely go with the 20 track &quot;Best of&quot;. Either way, you've got to have &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot;.
B00006LLNU|2.0|I don't get it...Agaetis Byrjun was a beautiful masterpiece.  This album just puts me to sleep except for a few gems...what went wrong?!  Buy any GSYBE or even Mogwai's newest one, which, though rather repeative, is far more interesting than this album.  Sigar Ros, please go back to the dynamic changes you left behind with Agaetis Byrjun, PLEASE!  I'd like to blame it on the music industry, but i just don't know...maybe this album will grow on me, but so far; every listen just disappoints me... I really enjoy post rock, but this just feels like a drunken Enya.
B000002UWW|5.0|To me, this is hands down their best cd. Besides being 18 tracks, it's full of the funkiest funk from their first four funky albums. This includes the early hits &quot;True Men Don't Kill Coyotes&quot;, &quot;Fight Like A Brave&quot;, &quot;Behind The Sun&quot;, and the covers of &quot;Fire&quot; and &quot;Higher Ground&quot;. Also &quot;Under The Bridge&quot; was thrown on for all the newcomers at the time. My personal favorites are &quot;Me &amp; My Friends&quot; and &quot;The Brothers Cup&quot;. If I could add anything, I'd have it be &quot;Why Don't You Love Me&quot;, &quot;Good Time Boys&quot;, and the whole &quot;Uplift Mofo Party Plan&quot; album. That rocks. Overall though, this is pure perfect 80's Peppers. I'd get this disc before their new &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; collection.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|The whole premise of the story is to save Zion.  Then they showed Zion.  I don't know what I expected.  But I didn't expect Zion to be just a rave party, with everyone giving in to the wilderness of their fleshy desires.  To me, Zion looked like a bunch of coke heads who were wasted on the blue pill.  After seeing that, I couldn't take anything further in the story, seriously.  <br />I kept saying to myself, &quot;Is it really worth all that effort to save THIS?&quot;  THAT is what Morpheus was referring to when he said, &quot;Welcome to the REAL world.&quot; ???  If that's the REAL world, I'll take the fake one.  <br />HERE IS THE REAL ZION:     [...]
B0000AXE8I|1.0|Okay, so this movie answers some questions that were not answered in the first one, but that is all. That is the only reason this movie is watched. It is completely abysmal, totally unnecessary and the special effects cold have been ten times better. Too much of Neo's &quot;Superman Thing&quot; with a digital Neo rather than the actor, and too much...amend that - a waste of time with the whole Zion thing. I hope that the next matrix is a lot better, but from what I have seen here, I seriously doubt it. Matrix Reloaded is not worth having, not worth watching, and seriously shows how someone can really stuff up a good story.
6304509154|5.0|This movie just goes to show you that a movie doesnt have to be rated R to be scary. In fact this movie is scarier than most of the R rated movies Ive seen like The Exorcist,Friday The 13th,Nightmare On Elm Street and even Halloween.Michael Myers is scarier Freddy Kruger and shocks you with that white mask but not as scary as the scene in Poltergeist when the corpses are rising out of the ground.In fact the only movie Ive seen scarier than this is Silence Of The Lambs.<BR> There are just very few things as your whole house turning against you.Thats all I have to say about that.
0790729407|5.0|I found that this film was in all ways an amazing and accurate piece of work.
B00004U8H4|4.0|American Psycho is a great movie, full of colour and tone. Although the violence is rather severe in some scenes, it's brushed off as nonchalant business by the yuppie, male-model, capitalist, bourgeoisie &quot;pyscho&quot;, played devilishly by Christian Bale! It's a great performance and along with a super supporting cast headed by another incredibly talented actor, Jared Leto, the movie picks you up and carries you away on a wave of mayhem, pulsating to the music of Phil Collins and Genesis while sporting a maniacal grin with glee!
B000000OQF|5.0|&quot;Yowsah,&quot; &quot;OH YAAAIEEEYAAAHAAA!,&quot; and &quot;EIIEEEYYYIEEE&quot; were all immortalized on the &quot;right-place-right-time&quot; Hollywood success-story-turned-classic-debut of rock and roll soulmates Guns N Roses.  But there's much more than meets the eye.<br />First something needs to be gotten out of the way.  While most people see this as a great album (a rare case of &quot;decent album gets praise&quot; in music), the naysayers (and there will always be those) who deride GNR and 'Appetite' for &quot;no talent&quot;(?!?!?!?) seem to be not so much fans of Bach, but rather Grunge and modern day bland-o-rama rock.  There is no deeper insult than a follower of 3-chord latency like Crap Cobain and the highly-virtuosic Blink 182 (that is sarcasm) tearing apart the mighty gunners for not having enough of what their own heroes have none of at all.<br />Slash may have sloppy technique, but every now and then a fluke of a person comes along where that doesn't matter, because the person is composed of 100% soul, feel, and pure emotion.  Cynics be warned: That means there's a legitimate comparison between the late jazz/bebop revolutionary Thelonious Monk and Slash.  And maybe I relate to Axl so well because I'd rather speak my controversial-albeit-educated opinion, like the one in the last sentence, rather than just keep bottling up unique conceptualization for the umpteenth year in my short human lifespan.<br />I personally think that, although it destroyed the band, &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot; is their best, and for good reason, as it is one of the best of all time.  It is more diverse and on a grander scale than &quot;Appetite,&quot; but non-haters of GNR be advised: we're all Guns fans (or whorshippers) here, so it is a minor discrepancy.  Let us give praise to the highly powerful masterpiece that is &quot;Appetite For Destruction!&quot;<br />This album is EXHAUSTING.  And in the best way possible.  If you actually listen to it start to finish (as I do), by the time it's over, you've worked off all that violent anger and rage that might have gotten you in trouble, and you've just burned as many calories by sitting in a chair that you would have if you'd have run a marathon.  There are, as most people know, the three mega-singles &quot;Welcome to the Jungle,&quot; &quot;Paradise City,&quot; and &quot;Sweet Child of Mine.&quot;  It's pointless to analyze them to death, as you usually can't help but hear one of them on a daily basis while going throughout your lives - from a bar, to a stadium, scrolling across the radio dial, and in the privacy of your own home.  For one of the very few times in music history, a band that has taken over the world has actually left behind GOOD songs that although you would be hard pressed to avoid them through the course of your daily routine, there is no need to.<br>And ok, maybe Slash could have learned some more scales - but the over 6 minute epic &quot;Paridise City&quot; has so much passion and fire, how can you not simply be exploding with emotion at the double-time finale of his mega-solo? Isn't it great that pioneers of &quot;alternative music&quot; wish Slash had learned the lydian scale, while the former individuals could only fumble to even pronounce it? Sad, sad irony.  And Axl's voice? He's the ONLY singer I've ever heard that can belt out a jagged-edged scream that stays scarily dead on pitch and has all of the sincere energy of an opera singer all in one breath.<br />Other songs on the album can be characterized as band staples, just as popular as the singles, although never marketed as such.  That's when you KNOW you've got a huge album on your hands.  &quot;It's So Easy,&quot; &quot;Mr. Brownstone&quot; (revealing their signature blues-metal funk), and &quot;You're Crazy&quot; all drill their way through your brain like a trainwreck that magically never seems to come off the tracks.<br />My own favorites, &quot;Nighttrain&quot; and &quot;Rocket Queen&quot; have such massive groove, you don't know whether you want to snap your fingers and dance (which I don't anyway) or bang your head into a wall (that sounds better!).  Many twists, turns, solos, screeches, and smashes await the listener who dares to enter the world that is &quot;Appetite For Destruction.&quot;  <br />It's about an hour of heavy rock, sucking the energy out of any lifeform it encounters along the way, and yes it's 80's influenced, but it's GOOD dammit.  Axl's very talented, probably the most of the whole bunch; his untirable voice combined with his decent piano chops (and I'm a piano major), coupled with his unfortunate past, all meld together to create the quintissential musical potential.   All combined, the GNR albums proved to be templates for rock and roll, albeit a late entry into the rock and roll game.  Nonetheless, it's some of the greatest stuff of the past 50 years.  Most people have an album where they say nothing has come along since then.  If I had to choose, I would say Guns N Roses in general was the last great thing about rock and roll.  Every band that has come along since then (with the exception of Dream Theater) has copied and pasted one watered down note (much less a measure) from the &quot;Appetite...&quot; catalog, and called it a career.  YES, Guns could have been EVEN BETTER, but NO, they were nothing short of MAGICAL as it was.  And all this talk of past tense reminds me that there's always a wing and a prayer for a reunion before they all turn 60.<br />Can over 15 million people be wrong? yes <br>are they wrong here? nope
0800129806|4.0|First Knight is a movie that got quite a bit of buzz, and at first I was quite skeptical over it.  It is among the few medieval movies out there and few Arthurian based films at that.  I think the idea was original, as far as making a movie about this.  Most directors are timid when it comes to opening a new genre.  So I have to applaud this film for that.  <br />This is a romance, not an action flick.  So as a guy, that turned me off, initially.  But being how I'm fair in giving each movie a chance, I saw it.  And it was surprisingly good.  At least the romance didn't have cliche Hollywood sex in it, they actually tried to give the characters some sort of moral fiber, especially Julia Ormond's character, Guinivere.  The action on the other hand is so-so entertaining.  I guess I was hoping for more sword play or more/longer battles.  Something memorable like that.<br />Although the romance is surprisingly good, it may turn you off.  Depending on whether you're interested in the storyline or you just want action, action, action.  I prefer the storyline, so the romance is just fine for me, but for others it may be boring.  And it is a little, I think they spend a little too much time with Lancelot doing everything in his power to charm over Guinivere.<br />Sean Connery is Arthur, fitting, and he does well enough.  I did like the love triangle in this movie, because Arthur is the third corner who is kinda out in the dark when it comes to knowing that his bride to be, Guinivere, is falling in love with Lancelet, who is Arthur's new friend.  And therefore, when Arthur learns of this, the betrayal is complete.  Romance with betrayal usually stirs up good drama and suspense.<br />From the other reviews you probably know the plot already.  And it's an OK plot.  Malagant is a great villain, a little cliche at times, but very believable.  His hatred towards Arthur and his desire to own Camelot makes the plot interesting.  I would've liked to have seen Malagant and Lancelot goat it more during the course of the film than just have them have at each other in the end.<br />Now I give this film 4 stars, because it has some errors in it that rightly should subtract a point.  I found Richard Gere to be a poor Lancelot.  He makes a good skirt chaser, but as far as sword fighter, he is a poor action star.  He seemed slow, and I bet the majority of his action moves was done by the stunt man anyway.  His sword fighting moves were not convincing, it seemed as if his opponents half the time were either too stupid or predictable.  And for a great swordsmen, he doesn't show off nearly enough of his skills in the movie to prove to everyone he really is all that great.  All he does is do some sort of crazy juke with his blade and knocks his oppenent's weapon away.  What is this, Barry Sanders with a sword?  In fact I almost laugh everytime I see Gere do it in the movie.<br />Another complaint I have is the other knights of the round table.  Why even have them if you aren't going to give them any significant roles and they are nothing more but props?  I would've loved to learn more about the other knights, but the movie obsesses over Lancelot's lusting of Guinivere, when that time can be used to bring in more characters and create more interest to the viewer.  Instead, there are three primary characters and everyone else might as well be scenery.  The reason why this is a let down for this movie is because anytime you depict a legend through a movie, it's never smart to just choose three members of that legend and just ignore the rest.  Because those of us that have some knowledge on Arthur and his knights know that there were other interesting characters of the Round Table than just Arthur and Lancelot.<br />I know I'm being picky here but I have to mention it, and that is I thought it was a little cliche to have Lancelot always having to save dame in distress Guinivere.  How many times does he end up saving her life?  Three, four times?  I can understand the first time, but then after that, it got a little too predictable.  I would've rather seen Lancelot prove himself to her without having to save her life a bunch of times.  But it's the \\"knight save princess\\" fairy tale that a lot of people get all glossy eyed over.<br />The final complaint is the end.  The burial.  They send him out on a raft and then torch it, letting him sink into the sea.  Now I know this was used for dramatic purposes, but remember, the Arthurians were devout Christians, who believed in what's called \\"Christian Burial\\" not cremation.  So that's inaccurate.<br />Overall, despite these picky points on my part, this film is still a good movie.  The movie is good, but it drops the ball on not including the other knights, and it over plays its hand with Lancelot's constant begging for Guinivere to smooch him.  If this movie had chosen a better Lancelot, included more of the Knights of the Round Table, and cut down some of the cliches I would've awarded it five stars.  Instead it gets 4.  Which is OK, it's a good movie and it is worth seeing.  But I can't say it's the FIRST movie on my list.<br />Grade: B
078681859X|5.0|Let's face it, fantasy is a well-worn genre, bloated with Tolkein ripoffs, tired generic plots and characters. There seems to be no end to the stuff...and no shortage of readers who'll swallow it. And to this we can add a new type of fantasy that is fast reaching critical mass for younger readers...the Harry Potter clone. Check the young readers section of your local bookstore and you'll find literally dozens of books about young boy and girl wizards. As the saying goes, everyone wants to be the first to do something second.<br />There is nothing new in fantasy, only old wine in new bottles. So when a new fantasy comes along that actually feels new its a red letter day in my book.<br />That rant is by way of saying that this wonderful book avoids the pitfalls of many fantasy writers simply by virtue of the writing. A few years back David (and Leigh) Eddings burst onto the fantasy scene with their original Belgariad books. Plot-wise they were simply Tolkein retreads without the epic mthology. But what made them so readable, and so popular, was the original and entertaining voice with which they told their tales.<br />So it is with Jonathan Stroud. This is a fun, wry, funny, well-charactered piece about a modern London where magicians rule the land and magic comes in the form of controlling various levels of demons (or djinn). Set amidst the political intrigue is a story of a young apprentice magician's quest for revenge via the use of the some-time narrator djinn Bartimeus. He is the main reason to read the book. His amusing, ironic take on events is worth the price of admission alone. The world itself is well drawn and realised, as are all the characters.<br />Yes there are shades of Harry Potter (a young apprentice wizard in a world of magic where commoners are virtually cattle) and various other genre books (Randall Garratt's Lord Darcy series spring to mind) but it's all done with such verve and charm that it quite rightly transcends its influences and becomes aclassic in its own right.<br />Buy it. Read it. You won't be disappointed. I look forward to the next chapters of this trilogy.
B00008WG3U|5.0|This has to be one of the best CDs I've ever bought.<BR>I enjoyed every minute of it. I must have listened to it like 500 times after I bought it. Quite amazing. Politics, The Truth About Pop Punk, and some just plain messed up songs. What more could you ask for in an album?
B000066NW0|1.0|I used to be a fan of Avril when I was younger. Now I'm 13 and I relize how FAKE she is! She CAN'T sing. I heard her live on TV once, and her voice is so horrible, the band is louder than Avril's voice! The songs are really bad, lyrics are horrible, and now I won't even listen to the CD anymore. Take my advice: Avoid this CD and Avril Lavigne's garbage. If you want to listen to a female singer who can sing with a gorgeous voice, plays guitar beautifully, writes her own songs, and has wonderful lyrics, I recommend the album \\"Pieces of You\\", by my favorite singer, Jewel.
B00008EY7H|4.0|This was a good DVD release.  While not having as many features as Varekaki, they tried to put some good stuff on the disc.  <br />As far as the show goes, it was so-so.  I have seen every Cirque show many times, some in person, some on video.  Quidam is my favorite, with Varekai and Dralion tied for a close second.  <br />It was nice to see the show finally, as I have only seen the story-movie Alegria, and it ties in really nicely once you've seen the cirque show.  <br />Personally, I think threre's a LOT of wasted time on this one.  There are less show acts, and more theatrical stuff.  Too many clown acts, and drawn out boredom (much better than some of the older ones, but still not up to par with the more current shows).  <br />I think the Fast Tracks (long trampolines) and the Russian Bars are the best parts of this show.
B00004XQP4|3.0|Not that bad, not that good. Not Green Day, but better than Britney,
B000008L90|4.0|I have to agree with the previous reviewer.  This is a very good album, even though I have to admit it's not the same as her previous albums, but nevertheless, it's still a good album. I'd definitely like to see this on cd along with &quot;Donna Summer Polygram,&quot; which is also another good album that I owned in the early eighties. I also recommend the Donna Summer Anthology, and The Wanderer (if still in print).
B00004Z4WR|2.0|No matter how many movies i see him , i can only think of him as the &quot;Don Knotts of the 90's&quot;.  There appears to be no end to what an Academy Award Winner can do.<BR>the movie is boring.  attempts to tease, but never really does anything.  i kept thinking i should just get bullit out and watch that again, much better movie and chase scene.
0380725398|5.0|It has been 5 years since I have read Jamaica Inn.  It started as a requirement for my Enlish class to read and do a review on an author randomly picked by my teacher.  I would never know the impact this book along with another, Rebecca, would have on me. I was never much of a reader before this experience and to this day I remember Daphne Du Maurier's books vividly.  She will always remain my favorite author.
B0000C7PSW|5.0|Retreating from the pop moves of Poses, Rufus Wainwright returns to the grandiose romanticism of his self-titled debut on Want One (a second disc, Want Too, is expected in February).  His pastiche of show-tune, opera, classical, and pop is exactly where this striking original should be.  When he tries his hand at a straight genre, such as the lounge electronica of \\"Shadows\\" on Poses, he's a pallid technician.  But when he juggles many balls in the air - as he does on most of Want One - you can feel his creative joy.  Sure, sometimes he's a showboat; I could live without Ravel's Bolero laden over \\"Oh What a World\\" myself.  But his mistakes are minor - more like temporary lapses.  Otherwise, it's one gorgeous tune after another, sung by a pro who's worked as much on his upper register as he has his recent sobriety.
0446310786|5.0|Through the innocent eyes of an 8 year-old child, Scout Finch and her older brother Jem are faced with the racism of society as their father, Atticus, defends a black man accused of rape.  This book reveals the \\"norms\\" of the time period and expresses realistically the various points of view.  The heroic figure, Atticus Finch, teaches his children the ways of the world and instills the values that are needed to become accepting and responsible adults.  Through some comedy and truth, the story conveys messages to the reader about life, racism and human emotion.  I recommend this book to all readers because it reaches to all levels.
0312319517|5.0|I enjoyed THE AVENGER. It actually digresses into character backgrounds a LOT--almost excessively--but those digressions are very interesting, so I actually enjoyed reading them. A subtext peeks through a lot that you think is going to have a bigger pay off in the end, but doesn't. But it's a real page-turner. I found myself wanting meals to end so I could get back to the book. And I absolutely love Forsyth's summing up of the terrorist personality and the true reason for anti-Americanism around the world. He is so so so so so SOOOO right about that it was refreshing to read.
0064407667|5.0|I went back and forth about whether I should get this book to read with my 7 year old second grader.  I kept telling myself I should wait till she was older, but found the book at a good price, so I bought it. I worried it would be too depressing and scary for her, but it did not turn out that way at all.  The book is written from a narrators point of view, so the personal feelings of the characters are never fully exposed and explored.  You know that the three orphans are sad about their parents death, but the book doesn't wallow in their grief and make it painful to read.  If you can imagine Vincent Price reading the book, that tends to make it a little more lighthearted.  The bad guy of the book, Count Olaf, is an awful brute who is outright cruel to the children at times, but again the book doesn't have the children suffering without end.  Instead  it makes them more resilient to foil the Counts plans and triumph over him.  My daughter was EAGER to read these books.  That was the best thing about it all. We have tried classics, Pippi Longstocking, Island of the Blue Dolphins, Charlottes Web, but as great as they are, they lack The Bad Beginnings level of excitement, mystery and wondering what will happen next.  I enjoyed the book myself and will continue to read the rest of the series, in hopes they are as entertaining as this one.  I can see if you have a very sensitive child, this would not be the book for them until they are older.  Some kids my daughters age are scared of Harry Potter movies, so this book would be too much for them.  If your youngster isn't living in a sheltered world where everything is wonderful and bad things don't happen, and they can understand the difference between a made up story and a real one, then they just might enjoy this new type of childrens adventure stories.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Definitivamente teniendo ms de diez aos siguiendo a Iron Maiden es imposible no disfrutar una obra maestra como lo es este album.Me gust mucho el Brave New World, estuve muy contento de escuchar como la voz de Dickinson mejora con el paso de los aos, as como tambin el tro de guitarras, entre las cuales destaca la creatividad de Adrian Smith. Sim embargo, Dance of Death sobrepas mis expectativas. Es un disco excelente, con un nivel de elaboracin y trabajo musical que no esuchaba desde la poca del Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. Quizs Wildest dreams sea un tema ms enfocado hacia el golpe comercial o tal vez pensando en los inicios de los conciertos de la prxima gira del grupo, sin por eso llegar a desentonar con el resto del disco. Pero a partir de Raimaker empieza lo que considero una muestra del mejor Heavy Metal del mundo tocado en tiempos actuales. Definitivamente mis momentos favoritos en el disco son Paschandale o Face of the land, sin dejar de mencionar Journeyman, tema donde la voz de dickinson suena realemnte hermosa, as como tambin el trabajo de cuerdas acstico es excelente. Compren el disco es completamente recomendable sobre todo si son fans del mejor grupo de Metal del mundo. Up the Irons.
B00005A1VH|5.0|I have seen this movie a few times before, It is a great classic, Set in Tenn. it is about a rough around the edges country boy that can get pretty riled up. He then finds god and is against all violence. He is drafted for the war and doesn't want to go cause now he doesn't believe in it. He is finally told he has no choice and while on the target range for qualifying he ask for a ( recheck )of the shots he fired, and earns the respect of the rest of his soon to be solders in arms. The movie just keeps getting better and better. I can't wait till February 2004 till it is released on DVD format. It will defiantly be a welcome addition to my collection
0140277447|5.0|About time a book like this was published on the Rape Of Nanking, a disgusting and atrocious act, proven beyond a doubt to have happened and with the entire world in agreement except for the Japanese, who say otherwise due to oppression, censorship and indecency. The publication of this book speaks volumes about the freedom of today and speaks out against censorship, which flows so abundantly in Japan. Obvious reason and truth have prevailed in this book over the propaganda in Japan. Thank you Iris Chang for this emotionally charged accounting of the horrors of the Sino-Japanese War.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Combine the harsh black, white and red album cover with the withdrawn video for the first single and you might think Madonna had lost it in the music world for the very first time.<br />Much has happened since the April 2003 release of American Life, Madonna as usual has quickly moved on from the military theme of the album cover and American Life music video. The harsh black hair and camoflage gear has been replaced by her trademark blonde locks and hollywood glamour. <br />Madonna has once again successfully reivented herself with the successful GAP compaign, that kiss at the MTV awards, the stunning video for the second almost ignored single &quot;Hollywood&quot;,<BR>the best selling childrens book and the new radio friendly single with Britney Spears.<br />The cover is decptive in the way that this is not an angry album, sure American Life as a track is uneven and the rap is<BR>questionable but tracks like the upcoming single Nothing Fails, the Estee Lauder commercial anthem Love Profusion and Intervention are about love and happiness. <br />Much of the album deals with self-worth and experience and this is highlighted by the track &quot;Xstatic Process&quot;. A simple multilayered ballad with not one electronic effect. <br />&quot;Mother and Father&quot; features a killer hook and a rap that works and is begging for a remix. Also included is the electronic Bond theme &quot;Die Another Day&quot;.<br />Other standout tracks are &quot;Nobody Knows Me&quot; and the haunting &quot;Easy Ride&quot;<br />So forget the cover and the military theme and get the album. Even through all the up and down reviews and personal attacks from the media it has still shifted 6 million copies to date - 6 million people can't be wrong.<br />I question how many reviewers here actually own the album.<br />Don't worry about Madonna's future - she is not going anywhere - for 20 years she has been &quot;over&quot; - name one artist from 20 years ago that still makes quality music....
B00000JPH4|4.0|The Dark Crystal is one of those rare movies that occurs in the overlap between two creative forces, in this case legendary puppeteer Jim Henson and reknowned fantasy artist Brian Froud.  The story is one of a world in steep decline yet lingering on the brink of renewal, the characters are endearing and beautifully made, and while it lacks Labyrinth's musical numbers by David Bowie, even the music is good.  <br />The puppetry in this is amazing, conveying the personalities and feelings of the characters with, considering that the movie was made in the early 1980s, a suprising amount of facial expressiveness.  Jen and Kira, the Gelflings, are full of warmth and friendliness while the reptilian Skesis are suitably sinister and scheming, the shaman-like Mystics are gentle and contemplative, the Podlings are lively and celebratory even in the face of Skesis opression, and even the mysterious super-fluffy-dog Fizzgig is wonderfully designed.  <br />Whether you're interested in this movie as a fan of Jim Henson's puppetry, Brian Froud's artwork, or just fantasy in general, it's devinitely a vital part of any fantasy movie collection (and one of the first parts of my own).
078062999X|5.0|(i kind of like the ethan hawke)<BR>but Branagh's Hamlet is the best.  He makes Laurence Olivier, Richard Burton, Mel Gibson and the rest look so shoddy.  Simple things he does, like the way he says, \\"who\\" when Horatio tells him he's seen his father are gorgeous.  I think they overdo the madness of Ophelia.  I don't see that violence, though some of it is good.  That's a hard part.  Derek Jacobi's Claudius is great.  He played a good Hamlet once, too.  The scenery is great, doesn't try so hard, but ends up being timeless.  Some of the flashbacks are a little annoying, a little bit too much dumbing down (showing the decrepit Norway for example), and the flashes to the sex between h+o are also... (I don't know the word), but weak.<BR>     Robin Williams sucks.<BR>     Charlton Heston ast the Player King is brillliant; the exchange between Hamlet and he are so good.  The whole story of Pyrrhus is never done in films.<br />    Keeping the whole text is great.  I watched it over a few sittings.  I keep wanting to go back to it.
B00005JLK1|2.0|This movie would seem to start with a good premise, and it certainly starts with a good scene, but somewhere along the line it just falls flat.  In the tradition of Virus and Deep Rising, a small group of people on an ocean-going tug discover a large, seemingly abandoned ship, and go aboard to explore.  However, Virus and Deep Rising worked because our characters were up against foes that they could conceivabley escape from.  In this movie, where there are supernatural ghosts on the ship, the viewer knows for certain that there's no chance of escape until the ghosts are defeated.  Unfortunately, this makes all their attempts at salvage and later escape rather tedius.  And when they find a large stash of gold on the ship, and the happy version of the theme song plays, and they start discussing how rich they all will be, well, the tedium grows to annoying proportions.<br />Also, there's the problem with the characters.  They're not very likeable, in fact they don't seem to like each other very much (even though we're told several times in expository dialogue that they're as close as a family).  At one point, I was rooting for the ghosts to kill one of the characters because he'd become quite annoying, and happily he was soon dispatched.<br />This movie is part action adventure, part horror;  a combination that has been used to great effect many times, but in this outing it just doesn't work.  The two plots work against each other, not together, as you know that their efforts are pointless and find yourself wishing they'd just get on with confronting the ghosts.<br />However, if you're one of those people who jumps out of your seat every time something unexpected appears on screen, you'll probably like this movie, as there is plenty of that.  The atmosphere is also quite scary.  So, some people may like this film quite a bit.  For me though, it just didn't work.
0800105877|3.0|they don't show the ghost, for one, but rather there's this sort of trippyish light, as if they're at a psychedelic rock concert.  Ophelia is the most gorgeous Ophelia I've seen, and she acts well, too.  While Anthony Hopkins looks spectacular as Claudius, he's not as good as Derek Jacobi in the Branagh version.  But he is quite good.  <BR>      Overall, kind of weak.  The costumes are lame.  The player king is good.

B0000AZJXQ|5.0|mostly mellow, this very heave album has it all, distant drums, powerful bass, some of the tightest guitar work ive heard since TOOLs Lateralus, and, well duh, the melody powerhouse that is maynerd james keenan.  This dive into the strange and sometimes spiteful yet funny world has left me breathless. from soft to hard, calm to calmer, than a punch in the face..repeat as desired.<BR>APC's new line up is, well, perfect. for example, the first album was like &quot;hey look what we can do!&quot;, now itts more like &quot;Hey look who we ARE&quot;. this is how a perfect circle should sound, they gave us a taste of it last time. now it should be here to stay.

B00005JLSE|1.0|Granted the dancing in this movie was keeping my attention,(thats it !)...but I didn't care of this movie at all!  They made way too much of a BIG deal over nothing.  I couldn't wait for the movie to be over with and I couldn't believe THIS was the movie I was waiting to rent &amp; SEE !!!!<br />DIDN&quot;T LIKE IT AT ALL!!!! I DIDN'T EVEN WANTED TO GIVE THIS MOVIE 1 star.<br />: (
B00000ILBK|4.0|Ok, from what I have heard, the main gripe about this film, is that it could have been a TV episode.  But when it comes to being a film, I think that this movie hits it right on the mark.<br />The humor in it adds some bubbly fun to a film that could have been all syrup and saddness.  And unlike some sci-fi films, the humor isn't contrived and it actually makes sense.  Who doesn't get a kick out of Worf's wart or Data's ability to be a flotation device?<br />Another thing that made this Star Trek film great, was that it didn't center on Captain Picard, like many of the other films (and TV episodes) have a tendency to do.  You get to hear about how other people are reacting to and experiencing this latest adventure.  Yes, this film does give Patrick Stewart an ample amount of screen time, but it also allows the viewers to enjoy little quirks about the rest of the characters we have grown to love over the years.<br />Complaints about plot holes and such I think are reading too much into the film.  This is sci-fi, ok?  Give the writers, directors, and producers a little leg room!<br />Overall, I believe this to be an excellent addition to the Star Trek family of movies.  A little bit of fun, adventure, intensity, and the well placed moral at the end.  So grab some popcorn, a pillow, and your phaser shaped remote control, as Insurrection takes you boldly into a different style for this crew, and has a bunch of fun doing it.
B00006RAKP|1.0|Some of my favorite Elton tunes are not even in this set...Where's the soulful &quot;Momma Can't Buy You Love&quot;???? Also, I firmly believe the ORIGINAL &quot;Don't Let the Sun...&quot; was much better than the subpar duet with George Michael. NEVER EVER FADE OUT A TUNE THAT ORIGINALLY HAD A COMPLETE ENDING!!!! What a disappointment. I've already gotten rid of my copy.

B000094DUP|5.0|Gee, what a great album. She is one of the most talanted singers I have ever heard. Unfourtunatly she had Hodgkins Disease. Buy this album...
B0000B1OFL|5.0|I loved it for many reasons:<br /> 1. The acting was amazing, Seth Green was hilarious in this movie, Donald Sutherland was amazing in his short performance. Charlize Theron is amazingly hot, and makes an also fine performance. Mark Whalberg is okay as usual. Edward Norton is alright as the bad guy again, but they're better bad guys out there. The rest of the cast was absolutely stunning!<br /> 2. The plot was ok, but they made it alot better by adding twists, with the good guys stealing then the bad guys stealing from them, it made it interesting.<br /> 3. It wasn't too cheesy &amp; not too much gore or swearing which action movies need to do more often now.<br /> Overall, it makes a great, fun &amp; entertaining night, TWO THUMBS UP!!
B000002LND|5.0|\\"The Immaculate Collection\\" proves that Madonna is one the greatest and most influencial female artist of all time.  This is a compilation of her greatest hits from 1983-1990 plus two new tracks: \\"Justify My Love\\" and \\"Rescue Me\\".  This album shows how she's evolved as an artist.  It guides us to funky underground to funky sexy to bubble gum pop with a message to religious to erotica.  Every track proves that she knows how to attract an audience and keep them guessing what will happen next.  <br />\\"The Immaculate Collection\\" is an important album for all Madonna fans.  All who enjoy her music should also buy \\"GHV2\\"(Greatest Hits Vol. 2), the compilation that continues where this ends.
0385335482|4.0|I enjoyed the entire &quot;Shopaholic&quot; series but I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 only because the books are easy to read and great way to just zone out and relax, they are not great literature. But they are rather fun to read and hard to put down because you are always wondering what the next crisis Becky will get herself into and how she will get herself out. You can relate to her if you have an ounce of the &quot;shopaholic gene&quot; in you, although, I wonder if there are people out there that are this crazy about shopping and if they get themselves this seriously in trouble. I consider myself a shopaholic but I have never gotten in the situations Becky has gotten into, not even close ! <BR>I have reccommended them and loaned the books to all my friends and we all agreed they are a great summer book to read or a way to get away from boredom and monotony of everyday life with a giggle. Do not expect a deep or serious novel with Sophie Kinsella's writing. She writes for the 20's and 30's woman who has a sense of humor.<BR>I look forward to more books by Sophie Kinsella.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|The only reason &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; gets a four-star rating is because of the spectacular special effects.  Expect Oscar nominations for Best Visual Effects, Best Editing, and Best Cinematography.  The best scenes are the elaborate visual effects: characters morphing into the villian, the villian duplicating himself, flying through walls, the freeway fight scene, Neo flying like Superman, and many more.  No one can see any of the computer enhancements, a rarity for film.  The original score is wonderful, especially the techno music.  Though the editing and the sound effects are wonderful, they don't match the original.  <br />Besides this, the plot is almost non-existant.  The only interesting events are Neo and Trinitys' love relationship.  Like many other action movies, the effects try to make up for everything else.  Some quotes stated don't make any sense and don't fit the storyline; example: &quot;you've already chosen if you'll accept the candy&quot;.  <br />Those who like action movies will enjoy this.  Those looking for more than just action may not like it as much.  The action and effects receive five stars.  The story plot receives less.  Fans should also look out for &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot;, the conclusion of &quot;Reloaded&quot;.<br />***Note: Those who want to see &quot;Reloaded&quot; must watch the original first.  Otherwise, everything will be confusing.
B00005JLTN|5.0|i saw this movie four nights in a row in the theatres, and every time it was better than the last.  there is so much happening that it takes time to allow all of it to sink in.  once it does, this movie is more than just appreciable... it is applaudible.  it's kinda like waking life... either you get it or you don't... and if you don't, you laugh at things that aren't funny just to ease the tension that is building inside of you because you realize that you are totally confusaed and feel like an idiot.  wake up!!!  the matrix is pure genius.  buy it and watch it and understand it.  peace
0380789019|5.0|My friends loved Neil Gaimans work long before I read any of his stuff. This was the first book of his I picked up and it quickly became one of my favorites.The writing style is a little confusing at first but you get used to it. For someone who doesn't read all that often or hasn't read him before I might recommend the Sandman graphic novel series first (it is AMAZING). I have followed Neil Gaimans work for a good 10 years now and have no plans to stop.
B000001FOS|5.0|This is one of the greatest guitar cds of all time.  Yngwie Malmsteen teams up with Turner (former Rainbow singer) to produce a fantastic cd that will blow your brain with guitar riffs and fill you up with quality songs.  Rising Force, track 1, is powerful and a perfect start to the cd with a great guitar solo.  Hold On follows up, and then Heaven Tonight: both quality songs.  The next song, Dreaming, didn't do much for me.  Bite the Bullet is Yngwie's &quot;Eruption&quot; (Van Halen) and it's not bad at all.  Riot in the Dungeons blows you away with it's lightnight quick riffs and long intro.  Crystal Ball is my personal favorite on this cd.  Turner on vocals is absolutely phenominal delivering perfect melodies and the chorus is very catchy.  The last three songs are good, but nothing stands out for me.  Overall this is a great cd, and one of the best guitar cds of all time.  Get this and Buckethead's Giant Robot for a true guitar experience.
0060934700|4.0|This is with-out-a-doubt an interesting read. Some of the stories will make you feel good...some make you feel disturbed...and others are somewhere in-between. It's a good variety of stories. It definitely kept me interested the entire way through. I have to add...It's very much an adult book due to some of the more graphic stories. Two of my favorites were \\"Snow Glass Apples\\" and \\"Murder Mysteries\\".
B00005J6SZ|4.0|This album made of Madonna the big star she is now, but it's far from being her best. Despite of that, this album does contains two of her best tracks, the catchy and groovy &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; and the awesome &quot;Material Girl&quot;. Other good songs here are &quot;Angel&quot;, &quot;Dress You Up&quot; and &quot;Shoo Be Doo&quot;. The rest are just fillers, like the stupids &quot;Pretender&quot; and &quot;Stay&quot;, and of course the awful torchy ballad &quot;Love don't live here anymore&quot; (give me a break)
0060934719|5.0|This was the second Neil Gaiman book I read. This book is great. I got completely caught up in it. I've read it twice in the last 10 years. The first time, I read it in a day. I love fiction/fantasy and this did not let me down. I first read it at about 18 or 19 and it's an exciting and charming story.
B00005JLYW|1.0|THIS UNRATED VERSION IS FALSE AND DECEPTIVE ADVERTISING. THERE IS NO FOUL LANGUAGE OR SKIN ANYWHERE IN THIS MOVIE. IT'S A TRICK TO GET YOU TO RENT THE VIDEO. AND IT'S TO COVER UP WHAT AND AWFUL MOVIE THIS IS. SO RIDUCLOUS AND THE TERRIBLE ACTING MAKES IT EVEN WORSE. RUN DO NOT WALK AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE IT SURLY IS ONE OF THE WORST OF THE YEAR.
B00005JLWN|5.0|A lot of people have been comparing this movie to The Matrix.  But the special effects and fight scenes are actually realistic and believable.  Not just a bunch of people flying around(obviously on wires) in slow motion for 2 minutes before landing a kick.  Also the story isn't confusing or complicated. Anyway, comparisons to Sci-fi movies like Gattaca and Minority Report are more fitting.  It's a futuristic version of society where rulers try to rid the world of war, hate crimes, etc. by eliminating the cause...extreme emotions.  So they use a drug to eliminate ALL emotions, including love and fear.  Where Gattaca targets classism (money buying status), and Minority Report targets morals (arresting a person who's done nothing), Equilibrium targets desensitization.  It's an excellent study in extremes in order to avoid...extremes.  Christian Bale plays the top &quot;cleric&quot; who begins to feel, and decides to join the resistance to knock out the system.  Where The Matrix failed for me (long, overblown, over computerized, implausible fight sequences), Equilibrium succeeds with good old fashioned martial arts with weapons (that NEVER is overlong or boring), and only a few special effects, and no wires at all.  So everything looks fantastic and real. A must for any fan of the &quot;futuristic society&quot; genre of films.  Definately in the league of Gattaca and Minority Report.  With better action and choreography that in big budget, highly digital movies, like The Matrix and Charlie's Angels 2.  Christian Bale will definately revive the Batman franchise if his performance in this is any indication.
185984054X|2.0|While Hitchens raises some valid points in this brief tract, they are badly served by the intensely vituperative, partisan and anti-religious language that he uses.  This is unfortunate, because it undermines the credibility of his arguments.<br />I do agree, however, that Mother Teresa has (or had) some explaining to do regarding her interaction with brutal dictators in Albania and Haiti, her intervention in the Keating Five case, her organizations inability to properly account for donated funds, and her apparent indifference to alleviating poverty.<br />Good points - bad book.

Now, this is just my opinion, but jeese,<br />I thought that cd would never end. This cd gets irritating after<br />five minutes of play. But that's just my opinion. I would not buy it!

B0000C7PQK|5.0|I've been a fan of Enigma since its very beginning, and I always try to be totally unbiased in my opinions. I respect everybody's opinions although some of them are completely missing any significant reasons as to why they hate the album.<br />Of course, it took time for me as well to like the album. But I love it, this is not a commercial album. What did you expect ? I prefer artists who try to evolve to &quot;artists&quot; always making the same music. Why don't you listen to &quot;Voyageur&quot;, &quot;Look of Today&quot;, &quot;shadows and light&quot;, &quot;Page of Cups&quot; a couple of times before criticizing it? Apparently the ones who criticized it have the right not to like it, but pleeeeaaaase, stop asking for the same atmosphere, the same lyrics, the same music : artists change. Michael Cretu is so gifted, nobody can have doubts about it. Now give it a try and then, give a significant opinion with, possibly, justifications : I would like to know the real motivations behind every criticism, the real reasons why some of you don't like the album, artistic reasons, not criticisms about the timing : 47 minutes ? So what !! Listen to Madonna's latest effort, this is not worth the money. But of course, some of you are probably going to but Britney's next record and will like it. God !<BR>Anyway, thank you Michael for sharing your gift with us. This album is great. Follow your instinct and please, don't stop.
0553345834|2.0|The book is full of nonsense that should be simple common sense to anyone that has worked in the business world.  Mostly this book is a chance for the author to talk of his many &quot;high level&quot; meetings and for him to boast about all of the execs and sports figures that he knows.  This book is rather entertaining, but you will not gain much from it in the way of business or management knowledge.
0140177396|4.0|This book is a good one. When I first read it it was about a six on my scale of 1-10. But now I have started to realize that it is more of an eight. maybee nine. This book goes so much deeper than one can imagine, and when you think about it it really is a shock. A shock of how much the american dream has changed, and how friendship can be destroyed. This book does make you think of society and the hopes of reaching goals, it challenges and disturbes you as you read it (actually as you think of it). But overall this book is powerful and it plays on your emotions quite weel, so it is definately a good choice of reading.
0790729725|4.0|For as long as he could remember, Henry Hill wanted to be a gangster. So, when he was 12 years old, he started running errands for the neighborhood wiseguy and extortionist, \\"Paulie\\" Cicero (Paul Sorvino). By the time he was 21, Henry (Ray Liotta) had made a name and a good life for himself stealing and reselling cargo. Along with Jimmy \\"The Gent\\" Conway (Robert DeNiro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci), Henry organized and executed heists big and small for their boss and protector, Paulie. He married a headstrong Jewish woman, Karen (Lorraine Bracco), who at first reluctantly and then enthusiastically embraced the gangster life. Even a prison stint didn't slow Henry down. Wiseguys get their own kitchen and accommodations in the joint. But Henry's defiance of his boss' directive in dealing cocaine and Tommy's violent outbursts threaten to destroy the world the wiseguys have made for themselves. Even $6 million from the great Lufthansa heist, the largest cash heist in American history, may not be enough to protect this group of aging gangsters from their own mistakes.<br /><br />\\"Goodfellas\\" is based on \\"Wiseguy\\", Nicholas Pileggi's biographical novel about the life of mobster-turned-state's witness Henry Hill, who lived nearly 30 years as a small-time New York wiseguy before being arrested and entering the witness protection program in 1980. Martin Scorsese directed the film with a mind not to glamorize the gangster life, but to accurately portray the world of minor mafioso, a world driven not by violence -the violence is incidental, but by money. Scorsese succeeds in getting the audience inside of this world. Robert DeNiro gives one of the best performances of his career as Jimmy, who starts out level-headed but is eventually unhinged by greed and paranoia. Joe Pesci is fantastic at conveying Tommy DeVito's unfortunate combination of easily bruised ego and itchy trigger finger. Lorraine Bracco is a convincing mafia wife, but her performance is at its most interesting when she first discovers how truly bizarre the domestic lives of mob wives are. Paul Sorvino gives a nice supporting performance as the patriarch of this extended family. This brings me to the starring performance of Ray Liotta: Sometimes I felt that Liotta was appropriate for the role of Henry Hill, and other times I thought that his line delivery was wrong. So I have mixed feelings about Liotta's suitability for this role. But, overall, his performance is convincing enough.<br /><br />\\"Goodfellas\\" is an entertaining look inside inside an iconic American subculture. The Italian/Sicilian mafia is a fringe culture which, for some reason, never ceases to fascinate the mainstream no matter how ugly or petty it gets. I admit to not understanding or sharing this fascination. Wiseguys are never smart or complicated men. They are simple, laughably predictable people who exist in a very straightforward environment of their own making. The most challenging aspect of making a gangster film based on a true story may be making the characters interesting. Martin Scorsese accomplishes this by using the camera to immerse the audience into the world of these wiseguys. They are interesting within their own circles, so they become interesting to us. \\"Goodfellas\\" displays some of Scorsese's most masterful and seductive work. It contains some great performances, and it gives us a window into the culture of organized crime. Gangster movies must have the highest rate of being true stories of any film genre.<br /><br />The DVD (This refers to the 1997 single disc release only.): This is a 2-sided DVD. The movie is on both sides of the disc, and you have to flip the disc in order to finish watching it. The transfer has problems. In one scene that I recall, there is a thin vertical black line through the picture. The only real bonus features are a few pages of production notes and the ability to subtitle the film in English, French, or Spanish. I wouldn't recommended this DVD to collectors. If you are interested in purchasing \\"Goodfellas\\", wait for the Special Edition DVD to become available.purchasing \\"Goodfellas\\", wait for the Special Edition DVD to become available.
B00004YW6I|5.0|I really like PJ Harvey - the girl has attitude, makes strong music and creates a lot doing it the simpler way. But I always thought people were idealizing her too much, and giving her more honours then she deserved. For me she was always a great indie-pop/rock act, never a goddess. Sometimes her music sounds strange, with repetitive lyrics and disharmonical arrangements. But the Story changed ... and the changes came from the city and from the see. With a beautiful title, this became one of my favourite albums ever, although many PJ Fans wouldn't even dare to compare it to their loved efforts ¨Dry¨ or ¨To Bring You My Love¨.<br />This album is more pop, but anyway very innovative. From the first beginning, Harvey's energy makes you wanna screamm out loud your most hidden emotions like on ¨Big Exit¨ or the great single ¨Is This Love?¨. The duet with Thom Yorke was a happening and the result was gorgeous: ¨The Mess We're In¨ has a sweet dark melody and their vocals are totally synchronized and combined into one of the best duets I found on the history of rock. ¨We Float¨ explores Harvey's vocal habilities in a beautiful slow song, and the single ¨Good Fortune¨, besides the favourite ¨A Place Called Home¨, are make you fall in love.... in these stories!<br />I would just mention ¨Horse in My Dreams¨ as an example of those sometimes boring melodies Harvey explores, but as an album this iten simply deserves 10 starts!!!

B00008J4P5|2.0|First of all, I must explain that I don't have anything against the White Stripes, and I own all of their previous albums. It is really incredible that only 2 people just sit down and decide to create a very special and impressive kind of music by going the simpler way (2 persons=2instruments) and without asking other musicians for help. They created a great style and became a hype, but... are they so innovative as they were in the times of ¨De Stijl¨? I can't say yes. The fact is that many people just knew them right now after the commercial hype with ¨White Blood Cells¨ and think they are doing a brand new kind of music while they are repeating themselves since the 1st album.<br />I don't think the lyrics on ¨Elephant¨ are really great, and the songs are sometimes SO noisy that they lose harmony (something that must be there even in the most noisy songs). Maybe they should listen to Neubauten, Bauhaus or Nick Cave.<br />Maybe they should just keep doing what they do and people should realize they are ¨hyping¨ them too much.<br />I only like ¨Seven Nation Army¨ in this album. Oh, I miss the your-pretty-good-looking-for-a-girl times!!!
0688170528|5.0|When I was first handed this delicate paperback novel by a friend, I pondered why the bindings were stretched, why several pages seemed as if they had been turned more than once.  More than ten of the pages had highlighting and the cover looked like it had taken quite a beating.  After reading the first page I understood why this book had sustained such damage.  It was not because it had been mistreated; it was because that it was so treasured that it had been read time, after time, after time. <br />The first page starts off shockingly abrupt with the words, &quot;and then there was a shot.&quot;  The novel then begins to delve into a story between two families; quickly evolving into a love story between two Romeo and Juliettish teenagers, destined for a future of trajedy and loss.  Readers will be transfixed as they are posessed by the intense need of this book to fulfill the cliche of a true &quot;page turner.&quot;  I highly recommend it for anybody who enjoys a good love story,yet also seeks a novel with an unpredictable plot.  The Pact is part tear jerking love story, and part Courtroom drama, intertwining the two categories and bringing them together to create a truly beautiful tale of love and loss that certainly justify my reasons for picking it up a seventh time.
B000002HPV|5.0|Although this album does not offer the homogenic songs the title suggests, you just get 10 delicious songs. The album is a special mark on Bj&ouml;rk's carrer, where she goes even more alternative and sounds passionate and, as the same time, something is strongly cold on it, despite of thebooklet images showing fleshplants and blood. It's the portrait of a naturally paradoxal icelandic soul.<br />The only fast track here is the fan-favourite chaotic ¨Pluto¨; inspirational hits include ¨J&ograve;ga¨  and ¨Bachelorette¨, both orchestral and electronic. ¨5 Years¨ is totally nervous and beautifully full of noises, ¨Immature¨is an interesting lament and ¨Hunter¨ a catartic strong hit. ¨All Is Full Of Love¨is the magic end of the journey, and Homogenic, the best work Bj&ouml;rk released ever!
0060512806|5.0|Neal Stephenson's Cryptonomicon has to be read to be fully explainable or appreciated.  An epic book, it details two interlocking plots involving two interlocking families:  The Waterhouses and the Shaftoes.  Part of the novel is set in the current day, and we follow two Silicon valley types, Randy Waterhouse and his friend Avi as they set up a \\"data haven\\" in the Philippines -- and as their fiber optic cables are laid on the ocean floor by the Shaftoes, American expatriate adventurers, a sunken German submarine is discovered off of Manila, filled with Nazi gold.  Strangely enough, the submarine contains a document with the world \\"Waterhouse\\" on it, and Randy is confronted with a mystery -- what did his grandfather actually do in World War II?  <br />The other part of the story is set in World War II, and we follow Randy's grandfather, and a marine named Bobby Shaftoe, through their adventures, which involve high level crtyptograhy and a secret military detachment which exists to spread disinformation to the Nazis and the Japanese, in order to protect the secrets that the broken Enigma codes have revealed.  <br />But this is no mere Clive Cussler tale -- it contains levels of irony, comedy, and just pure information that bring it to a very high creative level.  There are portions of this work that will have you laughing out loud -- the cameo performances by Lieutenant Ronald Reagan and General Douglas MacArthur are masterpieces of sublime absurdity -- and other portions that will leave you in wonderment at Stephenson's technical erudition (van Eck Phreaking anyone? 4096 bit encryption? \\"One-time pads\\" generated by a deck of cards?).  <br />It is a breathtaking performance -- a fascinating, complicated work that can be enjoyed on many different levels.
B000002HH2|5.0|Bj&ouml;rk's ¨Post¨ is the sizzling second Bj&ouml;rk's Elektra-album who really came to prove who she was and her place on the contemporary alternative pop music. This album consists in a non-stop sequence of hitsand pearls and is absolutelly heterogenic and diverse. The first track and single, ¨Army Of Me¨, is a really strong electronic tune. ¨Hyper-ballad¨ is aclassical Bj&ouml;rk song, following her innovative (but today very imitated) mixture of strings and electronic noises and melodies which began with ¨Venus As A Boy¨, and the song is a real poem where she creates images of suicide thoughts. ¨The Modern Things¨is another impressive electronic track, and ¨It's Oh So Quiet¨ her most successful single ever, a cover of a jazz classic where she really reinvinted the song and gave it a totally new and unexpected interpretation. Other pearls are ¨Cover Me¨, ¨Possibly Maybe¨, ¨Headphones¨, ¨Isobel¨, ¨You've Been Flirting Again¨, evry one a totally different, lyric and strangely melodic track.<br />Post is a classic.
0743243307|2.0|This read was a huge disappointment. There were so many opportunities to draw the reader in, yet the author failed to make the catch. Developing a feel for these characters was difficult at best. As emotional events unfolded in the life of Nazneem, the author failed to take the extra step of connecting with the reader. At one point a significant loss occurs, yet the emotional aspects of such a tremendous loss are completely neglected.
B00005MNP7|4.0|Although this album is under my Blondie and general favourites, I have to give it ¨only¨ 4 stars for a specific reason: although it countains 2 of my Blondie's top-ten favs (the beautiful  ¨Union City Blue¨ and the (for me) historical ¨Dreaming¨, my e-mail signature song ;-), and the also loved classic new wave/disco ¨Atomic¨, the rest of the songs aren't as good as these ones, although it's great to listen to this album in a sequence.<br />This album came after the huge internacional hit ¨Parallel Lines¨, and if you read the booklet of this increbible remastered version with precious b-sides, you'll see that the band was really under pressure and had the whole world expecting another big success from them. Despite of all the tension it may have created, the album was another platinum hit and in a short time the band turned to another level and made a different kind of arrangements and melodies which sound amazing and magic. You can listen to that and recognize it's Blondie, even if you are a casual Blondie-listener; fans can listen to every song on this album and recognize all the ¨Eat To The beat-only¨ elements they countain. The drums are a special element that really captivate us on these songs.<br />Eat To The Beat is also necessary if you like Blondie. Your life can't be the same without UCB and ¨Dreaming¨ on it ;-P
1558216847|5.0|Well, I do not know if this particular story is true or not, but my own great grandfather made a trip from Vladyvostok to Poland in app. 1875. He was forced into Russian army after January Uprising of 1863-1865. He was 16 at that time.  He spent 12 years in Russian army and tried to escape many times. Finally he succeded. Similarly millions of Poles were deported to Siberia from eighteen to twenieth century. Most of them perished. Some of them survived and returned to civilization, sometimes in extraordinary circumstances, via Japan, China, Persia etc. Their lives were absolutly amazing.<br />History of Poland may seem stranger than fiction. Most Americans have no clue about it. Their vision has been shaped by Polish jokes and Hollywood movies about WWII which are not that faithful in depiction of historical truth (The Pianist is an exeption).  Just study the subject a little more before you judge something to be false (or true), as your knowledge of the outside world is surprizingly limited!
B0000B3B95|3.0|I give Hulk three stars because of a couple of reasons.  First, I'll explain what I liked about this movie.  The plot was great.  I appreciated the diligence and hard work that the producers of this movie put in to make this Marvel Comic character come to life.  Secondly, I thought that the layout of the sets were very artistic.  (Hey!  Sometimes, it's the smaller things that count, right?)  Thirdly, I thought the actors did a great job portraying the characters.  Fourth, their intention of making a C.G. Hulk payed off really well.  Not only was he green (a little humor there) but he looked rather realistic.  It's amazing how far technology has gone.  Now, I will address what I didn't like about the movie.  I actually only have two, as a matter of fact.  I thought more transformations were needed throughout this movie.  People go to a \\"Hulk\\" movie to see Hulk, not David Banner.  Secondly, I think the producers overdid his abilities.  EXAMPLE: The scene in the canyon with him bouncing off the canyon walls and then \\"flying\\" 100 feet through the air into a pile of rocks.  EXAMPLE: The fact that he could jump up and grasp onto a flying helicopter.  EXAMPLE: The fact that he could pick a tank up and hurl it 1,000 feet away.  But other than that, I thought the movie was good and I give it three stars.
B00005V331|5.0|Despite what some people may tell you, MOTORHEAD were not the originators of thrash,death and black metal etc. VENOM,is without a doubt,THE band that laid the groudwork for everyone you've heard after (Bathory,Slayer,Possessed and a million more).Were they the best musicians? No. Were they the best songwriters? No. But they started the whole thing. Enough of that-on to &quot;Welcome To Hell&quot;!! Raw guitars,pounding drums,and the vocals of Cronos (while not a great singer,was copied by many).&quot;Poison&quot;,&quot;Live like an Angel&quot;,&quot;Angel Dust&quot; and all of the tracks really, are black metal classics. Many like their second album &quot;Black Metal&quot; better, but for me, I still like this, their debut, a little more. This is a must for anyone into the black/speed/death metal style we've come to know.
B00007G1ZC|3.0|I read &amp; heard so much about Akira's last masterpiece.  I watched his earlier offering in the form of &quot;Ran&quot; &amp; many of my friends told me that &quot;Dreams&quot; was heaps better as it's a more personal &amp; heart-felt works of the Director.  Compounded by the fact that this is also Akira's last work, I told myself that this is a must-have collector's item.  When I watched this movie, I could understand why Steven Spielberg &amp; Martin Scorcese liked Akira's work so much for its subtle &amp; abstracted messages that screamed out quietly &quot;Humanity&quot;.  All the short stories were beautifully taken &amp; at times, I would gaze at them with bewilderment.  At times, the scenes seemed to drag on forever but perhaps, that's Akira's intention to captivate our attention through the protracted silence with anticipation.  I found the experience exhilarating &amp; puzzling at the same time.  The only downside of this movie would be that the final four short stories all talked about the same topic, about our callous nature that eventually destroyed nature &amp; civilisation.  Furthermore, I questioned Akira's idea of using the same actor for different short stories.  It's quite interesting to see Martin playing the part of Van Gogh instead of directing a movie.  All I can say is that watch this movie with an open-mind.  For visual treat, don't miss this but if you expect a fast pace &amp; direct movie, you would be disappointed.  A definite must-see for Akira's fan!
B000062YAZ|5.0|Being a self proclaimed &quot;old school metal guy&quot;, I go all the way back  to the beginning of the genre(Venom,Exciter,Motorhead,Metallica and more). I have probably heard almost every thrash/death/speed/black metal album and band there is. I have over 2700 demos and live tapes of this style from 1981 till now, and in my opinion, &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; is untoppable. This is the tightest,most intense,ripping album of this style ever. Yes there are many great bands and albums in the underground, but nothing compares to this. It could be argued that Metallica are better songwriters and musicians, but they have never had any albums this heavy or intense. The precision and power is incredible. &quot;Jesus Saves&quot;, &quot;Raining Blood&quot;,and &quot;Reborn&quot; are brilliant of course. However, &quot;Angel of Death&quot; is on another level. Bands of this style couldn't dream of having anything this good. A lot of over the top praise for this album? Maybe, but it is that good! Check it out and I don't think you would disagree
0385504209|5.0|This book was one of the few great books that I have read lately. It was the perfect combination of mystery, thriller, and historical fiction. The fact that the book is written in real time adds to the excitement. The different points of view that you experience gives you just the right amount of information...explaining things and yet withoulding enough to keep you guessing. I couldn't put this down and with my busy life the fact that I read this in 2 days really says a lot.
0316776963|1.0|My book club chose this book for our upcoming selection.  A friend in the club and I have come to the same conclusion:  we cannot finish this book.  We have both read chapter after chapter, waiting for the book to be other than mildly amusing and somewhat boring, but we never got to any part that hooked us into the book.  The author seems to think he is hilarious, in a rather self-consious manner, and his whole tone seems to proclaim, &quot;aren't I just so clever&quot;;  apparently many people agree with him.  I seemed to miss everyone's boat here, because I found the book so boring that I could not go on anymore.
B0000C7PSW|5.0|Seems like most of the reviewers so far have been big RW fans, know all his previous CDs, songs, lyrics. Not me. The only song I've heard until Want One was his version of Across the Universe, which I liked, because it's a beautiful Lennon composition, but it didn't break any new ground.<br />So this CD came as a complete revelation to me. I bought it on a whim, popped it in the CD player in my car, and listened to the chorus of voices at the beginning of Oh What a World. Well all I can say is that by the time the hints of Ravel's Bolero played through the background I was convinced that I was listening to a masterpiece....a genuine raising the hair on the arms type of CD that is so incredibly rare in these days of pop pablum designed for the masses.<br />I feel like there are levels and more levels of enjoyment to be had in this work, and I will give it many repeated listens. So far Go or Go Ahead stands out, along with Vibrate. But there's not a weak song on the CD. Congrats to Rufus for winning back a fan who had pretty much given up on pop music's ability to transport and inspire.<br />And now off to buy Poses, and see what all the \\"real\\" Rufus fans were talking about...
0440237688|5.0|The Giver is possibly the best book I have ever read.  I received it from a friend about eight years ago, who received it from a teacher she had been working with.  Since then, I have given the book to no less than thirty people, each of whom has touched my life in a loving and eye opening way.  I have read The Giver so many times, I have gone through three copies!  I am in my twenties and have worked with children most of my life.  My favorite literature genre is young adult, but due to my age I am often not taken seriously by those around me when it comes to discussing novels.  I feel anyone who takes the time to read The Giver will understand my passion for young adult literature.  I continue to pass along the words of Ms. Lowry, because I feel the need to share with the world the meaning behind her stories.  I have read several reviews for The Giver which have stated it is inappropriate for the age it is written for.  It deals with controversial, or delicate, subjects, such as death, puberty, maturity, sexuality, love, the environment, child bearing, the roles of men and women, etc.  The list could keep on going!  The point is, for those of you who work with children or have children of your own, this book gives you the opportunity to discuss these matters with them!  Open up your own mind and let them open theirs to the world around them!  Some reviews say The Giver is too emotional a read for children.  Let them feel!  Let them get angry, or hurt, or scared, or joyful--talk to them!  I feel this is an excellent book for communication--if I didn't feel this way, I would not have written such a lengthy and involved review!<br />I also recommend Gathering Blue, by Lois Lowry.  It is an excellent companion to The Giver.
B00004ZD69|5.0|Wow this is an incredible double CD.  GYBE! had been on my radar for some time, but I had not bought anything by them and now I wish I could have enjoyed this much earlier.  Other reviewers have tried to sum up the sound through description, I will try through comparison (BTW I hate reviewers who criticize the use of comparisons to other bands in reviews--music does not exist in a vacuum and bands listen to other bands!).<br />Sigur Ros is the most common comparison, and apt as far as the album has a mixture of strings and guitars and use them in long droning passages.  I would say that GBYE! is more traditional in its instrumentation and song structure, and not so precious as Sigur Ros.  The music, (mis)informed by GYBE!'s WTO bashing politics has a harder edge.<br />Almost all good music produced in the last 20 years comes back to Sonic Youth and this is no exception.  There are parts here that will remind you of &quot;Providence&quot; from Day Dream Nation, and the overall mood and atmosphere I would liken to the Bad Moon Rising CD.<br />Overlooked similarities are with some early 4ad bands:  Cindytalk, and Dead Can Dance (but angrier and less sophisticated), and if you like Medicine, And they will know us by the trail dead, My Bloody Valentine you will most likely eat this up too.<br />The engineering is great for the music, instead of cleaning up the tracks, they left the mix raw so that it sounds as if it were (and maybe was) recorded all at once, almost a live feel.<br />One of the best albums I have purchased in the last 2 years.
B0000C7PQK|5.0|Voyaguer, as different as it is from the previous Enigma cds, is still truly excellent.  After so many years of your usual chants and flutes, it takes some time to get used to.  I must admit, the first time listening to it, I was slightly dissapointed.  But after a couple more times of listening, I must say this is my favorite of the Enigma cds.  It can slightly be compared to the Screen Behind the Mirror.  The Screen Behind the Mirror had a harder edge to the music than the previous cds and didn't have as many chants.<BR>I looked through all of the reviews and was dissapointed to see how many people were so negative about this cd.  People said the lyrics were silly, it was euro pop trash, the magic was lost...so on and so on.  So not true.  <BR>There is nothing about the lyrics that are silly.  They are truly beautiful.  And whats this euro pop trash?  Euro pop is not a bad thing.  I must say, I have always associated pop with your Britney Spears.  I am sorry, but that is your pop trash. Sure, her songs are ok to listen to on the radio, but I would never invest my money on one of her cds.  Pop done right is nice.  Engima did pop right.  I can't understand why it is thought to be trashy.<BR>I am glad Enigma changed.  After about 4 cds of the same ingredients, it was time to change.  I loved the European feel to Voyaguer.  I have lived in America my entire life and I am so disgusted with the music.  Its all the same after a while.  Its so boring.  I have had a whole new outlook on music after hearing Enigma.  Everyone of there cds deserve 5 stars at the very least.<BR>Sometimes the best music isn't always played on the radio.
B000000W9Z|3.0|Tracking David Bowie from 1985 through the present is akin to going through a funhouse stacked floor to ceiling with bent mirrors: everything is distorted, yet everything seems very familiar.  For as soon as Bowie issued `Let's Dance' and its afterthought of a companion album, `Tonight', he lost his way, flailing wildly in different directions in attempts to either escape (Tin Machine) or embrace (the `Sound and Vision' tour, circa 1990) his past, all the while trying to reconnect with a past collaborator that would give him a new spark.<br />`Outside' finds Bowie already through with his reunion bit with Niles Rodgers and Mick Ronson (`Black Tie White Noise'), yet not quite ready to re-embrace Tony Visconti (`Heathen', `Reality').  So this time it's Brian Eno co-helming the project, and as can be expected, the results are effects-heavy and concept-light: the perfect Gary Numan comeback vehicle.<br />The loose plot of violence-as-art tangles with the songs, dragging them down not unlike Pete Townshend's narratives in `Psychoderelict.' The character pieces - all performed by Bowie, of course- smack of smugness and whee-it's-a-vocal-effect nonsense.  But like any Bowie album, there are moments when it all comes together: the brutal \\"Heart's Filthy Lesson\\", the rusted rock of  \\"I Have Not Been to Oxford Town\\" and the loneliness vacuum of \\"Hotel\\" all stand out as good songs.<br />It would be a few more albums before Bowie would chill out enough to start songwriting again, but this isn't a bad intermission.
B0000013G9|5.0|CrazySexyCool was TLC's masterpiece.  All that could be united in an album from pop to hip hop, from R&B to rap, this album has it all.  TLC got rid of the funky funny image that they have portrait with their debut album.  Now they approach to a much mature audience, being sexy and social aware.  \\"Waterfalls\\" the undeniable highlight of the album, perfectly describe the newer issues that affect today society in a perfect slow hip hop, \\"Creep\\" the first single release was a urban attempt, that fitted so well in TLC style, and focused on the cheating guys!, the love songs were well represented by the ballads of \\"Diggin' On You\\", and the sexyness was fullfil by so many sensual R&B tracks, \\"Kick Your Game, Red Light Special(wow!), If I Was Your Girlfriend, Take Our Time\\", and the funkyness wasn't left out here \\"Case Of The Fake People, Switch\\", overall, TLC's CrazySexyCool could be labeled as a perfect soundtrack of the middle 90's, and represented more than 10 million copies sold!, incredible this has to be the ultimate TLC album, and the best they ever crafted, and makes us realize how much they're gonna be missed.
B000068IEU|1.0|Lurid junk. The scenes in this film are disturbing yet the horrible acting is even more so disturbing.If you are to view this movie take into mind that its very primitive and savage. I don't think but about 000000000.1% of people alive today remember this. Heck, even Wes Craven forgot he made this pile or atleast he wants to forget.
B000002MY3|5.0|Jagged Little Pill was an album well written by Alanis and produced by mr. Glenn Ballard, it does not reached the titled of overproduced...it reached the state of an album that showed that you can be mad and still enjoyed singing about it.  None of the tracks were in any way filler cuts, &quot;All I Really Want&quot; showcased the plead for justice!, &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; was purely the I'm over you, but I want to hurt you song, &quot;Perfect&quot; stated the way that everybody feels by the pressure of being somebody in this life, &quot;Hand In My Pocket&quot; was a parade of life, &quot;Right Through You&quot; tell it in your face song, &quot;Forgiven&quot; as someone who believes in the power of God I do understand this, &quot;You Learn&quot; a song about life, and how you have to face it, with courage, &quot;Head Over Feet&quot; ay ay love, so complicated and simple at the same time, &quot;Mary Jane&quot; storyteller, &quot;Ironic&quot; the title say it all, life is in fact ironic. &quot;Not The Doctor&quot; if there was one song I didn't get, this was it, &quot;Wake Up&quot; already over yet?, the hidden track &quot;Went to your house&quot; is an amazing acapella song that showed the hurt and dissapointment, when you find out your lover is cheating..........An album that changed a lot the scenario for  woman in music back in the middle 90's, this album established the ladies as a strong force in rock and roll, and her leading lady Alanis Morissette. A unique and undoubtly classic record.

B000002HHB|5.0|Misty voice, strange behave and lyric genious, Natalie Merchant made the smartest move by leaving her former group &quot;10,000 Maniacs&quot;, now she won't have to share the pay check with so many people, alone sadly for any of her former group, she sounds better and not corny like she used to, this record has to be one of the best that came from the year of 1994-1996 where woman simply rule the rock music scene, other LP from that female era were (Jagged Little Pill by Alanis, Pieces Of You by Jewel, Tuesday Night Music Club by Sheryl, Yes I Am by Melissa E. and Relish by Joan Osborne), along with Tigerlily marked a unique state of music, that will be remember as simply welcome.  Many of the tracks tells their own story, &quot;Carnival&quot; the first single describe the busy life of a human being and the little time we ever take to see around, and take a glance of life, somehow the first time you listen to this record you will get bored to death, except for &quot;Wonder&quot; and &quot;Jealousy&quot; the upbeat songs in the album, but you will grown to understand the lyrics and the feeling of the album, after all, ....Go west..paradise is there...St. Andreas Fault one of my favorites!<BR>Buy!

B00000ILDE|4.0|One of the halmarks of the Alien franchise is the use of talented, upstart new director - in this case, James Cameron - who scripted this film right after the success of 'The Terminator'.  Whereas 'Alien' was an exercise in the horror of isolation of space, 'Aliens' takes a turn into an action-war film.  Remembering that 1986 was also the year of 'Platoon' and 'Full Metal Jacket', it is no suprise that Cameron chose to insert plot lines that paralleled the Viet Nam experience (i.e., a technologically superior race ultimately gets in over its head against a much more primitive enemy).  With an excellent ensemble (Bill Paxton, Lance Hendrickson) that actually matched the original, the sequel actually worked well.<br />What merits particular attention with this DVD is the inclusion of significant deleted scenes, which were left on the cutting-room floor because of time constraints (the movie was already pushing 2 1/2 hours).  The most important is a scene where Newt's family ventures out to the alien spaceship for a nasty surprise.
0393057658|5.0|I don't care for sports, and never have.  But this book is a GREAT STORY that just happens to be about sports.  It is the classic story of the maverick who defies all the conventional wisdom but knows what he is doing and prevails.  On yet another level, it is a terrific story about how one can think in an entirely new and different and above all USEFUL way about something that nearly every American (except me) knows something about has has strong opinions about.  In this respect it's very similar to stories about incredible scientific discoveries.  Either way, it's a great read that you won't want to miss.
B00000ILDF|4.0|(3 1/2 stars).  I have to admit that of all the Hollywood franchises, 'Alien' has been the most successful and consistent in terms of quality.  (Perhaps this is why the 4-DVD series box set released in 1999 is now being re-released as an 8-DVD box set with the original version AND director's versions for each film at the end of 2003.)<br />One of the reason for the success is change.  In the epic sequel, 'Aliens', director James Cameron left his mark by shifting from the original horror formula to the action genre, culminating in a triumphant ending where the planet with the aliens has been nuked and the queen is dead.<br />In this controversial third installment, upstart director David Fincher (who would later direct the brilliant 'Se7en') returns to the original vision - the horror of helplessness and isolation - one alien, an inhospitable environment, and no weapons.  For good measure, everybody Ripley cared about from the previous film are killed and she is infected by a queen alien.  For many fans, this represented too many nihilistic plot twists to swallow.  However, even amidst the controversy surrounding the production, the very dark vision for this film was there from the beginning and embraced by Sigorney Weaver.  Overall, the atmosphere of the set is great, the cast is superb, and the script is refreshingly bleak in its wholehearted attempt to not only end, but put a punctuation point, on the franchise - an attempt that would ultimately fail.<br />The weak part of the film is the rendering of the alien creature itself.  Originally, Giber envisioned a large four-legged bull-sized alien, quite different from the creatures previous incarnations.  However, at the last minute in production, the alien was begotten-by-dog.  In any case, the CGI (circa 1992) does not blend very well with the environment and the size and movement of the alien is inconsistent (e.g., does the alien run on two legs or four?)
B00007KQA3|4.0|An exceptional movie except the Eurithmics soundtrack is missing!  How fantastic was this original soundrack?!  It was so haunting combined with the imagery (ie.- Smith escorting Winston to a beautifull grassy plain), that the movie haunted me for two weeks after I first viewed it!  I love this movie and feel it is one of the best films ever made, especially with the Eurithmics sountrack warped and wobbly, painting a more surreal and inescapable nightmare.  The sounds reflect a feeling of seperation; a feeling of becoming disengaged!  We unfortunately do not get to hear this orginal score.  For a movie as wonderfully made as this one and considering the fans of the Eurithmics original sountrack, I feel MGM needs to be more considerate of this work of art and give people the option to hear both versions of the film.  This can be easily achieved with the DVD format, yet this very important option was left out.  Watching this DVD with the altered sountrack is like eating a vinyl sushi window display.  It looks like sushi but it has no flavor!  I strongly urge MGM to re-release this great film and give the Inner Party what they deserve...THE ORIGINAL!!!!
B00008OWZC|5.0|Goodie! Goodie! Goodie! I've read lot of reviews in my time, but I've never read one as stupid as that one! Led Zeppelin rippin off the Spice Girls? HA! HA! HA!  That takes the cake! The Spice girls weren't even around when Zep was jammin these tunes!! Where is yo' head Ned?
0783240287|5.0|This movie is not a standard issue Hollywood production. It has a very good humor, it has both general and musical culture, it has a delightful artistic play. I was very cautious about this movie in part because of religious topic, and in part because of some reviews here at Amazon. I've got it three days ago and I already viewed it three times.<br />First, they took the Bible story, and what usually happens there is that producers screw it up. Hypocrisy, fake pathos, sugar-coated heroes, and operetta-style villains often make biblical movies hardly bearable. Remember Disney's \\"Prince of Egypt\\"? Not here! Here there are none of such atrocities against the viewer. Joseph is not a semi-god or an angel, and his brothers are not accomplished criminals. You can understand how he'd got them to do what they have done. On another hand, creators of the movie did not flipped everything over either. What Joseph's brothers have done becomes understandable, but still wrong. Being able to survive such a delicate balance is already a huge accomplishment, but here is more.<br />The music and singing is excellent. Of course, if you are accustomed to Britney Aguilera and nSync, you may found it difficult to follow. This is a modern opera - it does matter what they are singing, and it's not rhythm-based drum solo either, it's melodic. But if you understand good music you will be delighted. Even some little imperfectness, when happens, is carefully measured and serves its purpose. Anyway, well, that's Webber, he does know what he is doing.
B000002KXV|4.0|This is a great classic album by a master musician and songwriter, but it suffers terribly from a very low output level. In other words.....IT'S NOT LOUD ENOUGH! I have a Sony 100-disc CD player and when I play this CD in the shuffle mode with other discs, I can barely hear it! Please guys! Remaster this with a higher output level! Nothing else needs changing at all. The production otherwise is superb. I don't know what happened on this one. I have CDs of recordings much older than this that are much louder. I wish that there was an industry standard for output volume that publishers had to comply with, and I also hope that Mr. Fagen or Mr. becker read this review.
B0000C23DO|5.0|I hear alot of people complaining about how so many songs are missing and how you don't get enough live tracks. Who cares? Listen, who honestly wants studio versions of songs that were taken off like &quot;Dark Star&quot; and &quot;China Cat Sunflower&quot;. If you are a new Dead fan buy this studio album only, however, get ALL of their live stuff. That is what's important. If your a true DeadHead though, buy all their studio albums and live albums and forget this. <br />   One thing I will say though is that this collection is MUCH better than the other &quot;Skeletons In The Closet&quot; collection.<br />   Anyway, just buy this. It's awesome. Peace.
B000001GQT|5.0|As one who records music groups and symphonies, I have to say that listening to this recording, I was truly amazed at the quality of the recording, yet the intensity of the performance is not spared in any way.  In fact, while background noise is minimal, one can hear subtle movements of the orchestra, the snap of the bows, and even valves on the brass instruments, a remarkable feat even for today.<br />Karajan has always been one of my favorites, and this recording shows why.  His interpretations are wonderful, and his tempos nearly flawless.  Karajan leads the Berlin Philharmonic to a level of dominance not before nor since accomplished in a recording session.  The engineers did a wonderful job ensuring that all parts are heard, and that the correct balances of strings, winds, and brass are met with perfection.  The dynamics of the recording hall can also be depicted, and adds to the brilliance of this recording.  This all makes this album a wonderful work to have!
B0000A02TZ|3.0|Since Animal House is certainly one of the greatest of its genre, I had great expectations for this special DVD edition. However, there is no documentation inside the package, other than an single leaf advertisement. I found this strange, not even a flimsly single sheet noting the contents. When you boot the DVD, there is no way to avoid the embedded previews other than fast forward, which in future viewings will be obsolete and annoying. The &quot;special features&quot; include interesting interviews about the making of the film, but also include a mock up of a &quot;where are they now&quot; that attempts to be humorous, and sadly at the end does no justice to the untimely death of John Belushi. A great film with a terrible DVD package.

Em says his hype is because he is white and that he ain't the first rapper who has been controversial.(5 Stars)<br />3/Business-Hot lyricsim but an average track by Em's standards.(3 stars)<br />4/Cleaning Out My Closet- Talks about hatred towards his mum and how he was treated badly. He basically just wants to get it all off his chest. It's quite boring though in my opinion.(3 stars)<br />5/Square Dance-CLASSIC! Eminem goes political and also takes shots at Canibus but nothing special. Other stuff he talks about on the song is excellent.(5 stars)<br />6/The Kiss-skit(NO RATING)<br />7/Soldier-Decent track with a hot beat(4 stars)<br />8/Say Goodbye To Hollywood: CLASSIC! Talks about hard times and how being in the fame hasn't figured out all his problems and how he wants to give his daughter the life he never had.(5 Stars)<br />9/Drips: Garbage track about unprotected sex. Obie Trice's lyrics are heavy though. Rubbish beat.(2 stars)<br />10/Without Me: I ain't feeling this really. Pop rap(2 stars).<br />11/Paul Rosenberg: Skit(NO RATING).<br />12/Sing For The Moment: CLASSIC! Em talks about y they get into rap music and how rappers have gone from nothing to something. It really is deep stuff. Also samples Aerosmith.<br />13/Superman: Misogyny track but it's catcy. We've kinda heard Em say stuff like this before.(3 stars)<br />14/Halie Jade: CLASSIC! EMinem sings in this track and does a good job. U gotta applaud the way EM shows love for his daughter.(5 stars)<br />15/Steve Berman: skit(NO RATING)<br />16/When The Music Stops: Features D12 and they talk about what being in the music business can do to you. Kon Artist steals the show. Bizarre says some interesting stuff but his lyricism is still whack.(4 stars)<br />17/Say What You say: Dre dissed Jermaine Dupri hard. Em takes another parting shot at Canibus. The rest is braggadocio rap over a hot Dre Beat.<br />18/Till I Collapse: CLASSIC!Em says he will go on no matter how things tough get. Same beat from We Rock You.Nate Dogg is great on the chorus. (5 Stars)<br />19/My Dad's Gone Crazy- Not a great beat by Dre. Em shows his funny side a little again. His 3rd verse is more serious and is the best. (3 stars)
B000084T18|1.0|And Fiddy is the reason.  This is crap!  I hate it.  The world don't need another rapper trying to be a 2PAC clone(or a reincarnation lol right).  He only got popular because of Eminem.  I bought it because of the hype.  Fiddy is an idiot.  If he wasn't doing this crap, he'd be mopping the floors at Macdonalds.
B00000ILDF|3.0|My favorite movie of the Alien series will always be Aliens (Alien is also great, but not quite as fun to watch in my opinion).<br />As for Aliens 3, I have a hard time deciding if I like it or not.  Although it beats the fourth installment, there are pluses and minuses to this movie.<br />The biggest thing going for this movie, in my opinion, is the atmosphere.  It would be hard to follow up on the example the first two films made when it comes to atmosphere, but I think this one still holds up.  I think the prison setting is very bleak and tense, especially in scenes such as the early one with the inmates holding those flares in the tunnels, and the final chase scene in the corridors as the inmates try to lure the alien into the lead furnace.<br />However, I think the movie has some noticeable flaws.  The most annoying, for me, would be the alien itself.  I don't know who decided to use CGI in this movie, but frankly I see this as an early example of people overusing CGI just because it's available.  I get sick and tired of movies (especially in the last few years) that use massive amounts of computer-generated effects when they can have more impressive scenes using puppetry or other techniques.  Quite frankly, there is something wrong when the alien in Alien 3 looks worse than the one in the first movie, made 10 years earlier.  Fincher (or, wasn't it some other guy directing a lot of the movie, and Fincher came in later?) should have just used puppets, bodysuits, and that type of thing.  Why can't people just stick to what works, instead of doing whatever is newest?  I can't get too nervous when the Alien looks like a well-drawn cartoon figure.  Ok, CGI rant over.<br />My other main complaint with this movie, which I have more trouble on, is it's negativity.  I normally love movies that have a negative feel to them (Night of the Living Dead, The Thing) but I guess this time it was just a little TOO much of a downer.  I mean, they kill Newt and Hicks before the movie even starts!  And Hicks was one of the coolest characters in Aliens, other than Hudson.  Hell, they were all cool.  I can see how it might be hard to avoid doing this in making a third movie, but sheesh.  So, after Fincher kills the survivors of Aliens 2 in the first 10 minutes of the movie, what happens at the end?  I guess I'd better not give it away in case someone who's reading this actually HASN'T seen Aliens 3, but... well, I guess such a negative ending can kind of suck when you've been following along with a series for 2 movies already.<br />Anyway, that's where my ambivalence about the movie comes in... I have a hard time deciding if the movie is dark and despairing in an awesome way, or just a big punch in the kidney.<br />I'll give it 3 stars cause of the atmosphere, and because even if it's a shadow of its two predecessors, it still beats the heck out of watching most movies.
B000002J03|5.0|Written and recorded during one of the most historical periods for rock music--1969--this album has it all: blues, rock, some folk, and even touches of heavy metal.  I bought this cd in 1997, and it is only one of a few in my collection that I can listen to from beginning to end.  It is truly amazing how such an album has had so much direct influence on music for the past 30+ years.  If you listen to many of the popular rock bands today, it is easy to trace their influences back to Led Zeppelin and especially this album.  This was Led Zeppelin at its highest....no other albums or songs would quite compare to Led Zeppelin II...and no other bnad has quite been able to match it.
B000089RVX|5.0|I cant figure out how these guys dont like the music. What matters if its a mix of other bands? Being a mix of good things on different bands seems to me what i should do to make a real good band. i loved each and every music on this CD, and the most of people in the world thinks the same. And you guys should stop envying them. Go get a life.
B0000669JL|3.0|...But if LEGEND is the only Bob Marley album you own, GET A LIFE! Sure, LEGEND is great, but a MUCH BETTER posthumous compilation of Bob's stuff is REBEL MUSIC. Much less mainstream and commercial! LEGEND is played out; if you're a true Marley fan, you'll buy the original albums (nine studio albums, and three live albums are readily available). If you don't have the patience to listen to all of Bob's stuff, and you want a REALLY GOOD compilation, get the SONGS OF FREEDOM BOX SET. But please, please, PLEASE don't buy yourself a copy of LEGEND, memorize all the lyrics to all the songs, and then go around calling yourself a Bob Marley fan, or a reggae fan. People like that are a disgrace to us TRUE reggae believers - ONE HEART! ONE SOUL!

0783233477|5.0|This film is really impressive and moving. Yes, it's a long film, -180min- but not like those ones you get tired in the first hour. It's 3 hours of emotional and unpredictable happenings, showing an impressive plot where Brad Pitt, as Joe Black, acts as Death in a human body. His extraordinary performance makes people believe he's really death, what truly frightened me. To top it off, Anthony Hopkings plays Bill Parrish, Clair Forlani's father. She falls in love with Brad Pitt, but she doesn't know almost anything about him, which makes it a very mysterious relationship, mixing life and death, weakness and power. For me, it's the most touchable relationship I have ever seen! <br />This film, although sometimes funny, will certainly touch you and make tears role down your cheeks, like it happened to me. I can just say that it's fantastic. You can watch it many times and you won't get tired of it, you will just appreciate it even more. <br />It's certainly my favourite film of all time and really worth seeing.
6305609705|5.0|Francis Ford Coppola's original 1979 version of Apocalypse Now is a dark, sardonic, surrealistic yet mesmerizing reworking of Joseph Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness.  Starring Marlon Brando, Martin Sheen, Robert Duvall, Fredric Forrest, Larry Fishbourne, and Dennis Hopper, Apocalypse Now trades Conrad's African setting for the then-still largely unexplored (by Hollywood, anyway) jungles of Vietnam.<br />The film's premise is deceptively simple.  A hard-bitten, combat-weary Capt. Benjamin Willard (Sheen) is given a difficult (and highly classified) assignment: he is to travel up a long Vietnamese river on a Navy PBR (river patrol boat) to find the jungle outpost of Col. Walter Kurtz (Brando), a highly decorated and intelligent Special Forces officer who has gone \\"rogue\\" and utilizing what one senior officer describes as \\"unsound methods\\" to fight the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong.  Willard is to locate Kurtz and \\"terminate (him) with extreme prejudice.\\"<br />In what many viewers of this movie consider the classic centerpiece of  Apocalypse Now, Willard and his uneasy Navy companions need the assistance of Lt. Col. Kilgore (Duvall) and his Air Cavalry unit's helicopters to get past a too-shallow part of the river, or else the PBR will run aground. Trouble is, as Kilgore (a \\"warrior-surfer\\") points out, \\"Charlie\\" controls the mouth of the river.  Still, Kilgore agrees to escort Willard and his PBR for two reasons: he loves a good battle, and the location is ideal for surfing. (When one of his soldiers points out that the place is known as \\"Charlie's Point,\\" Kilgore barks, \\"Charlie don't surf!\\")<br />What follows is perhaps the iconic scene no other Vietnam War movie has been able to top: the early morning helicopter assault on Charlie's Point.  In a terrifying yet oddly exhilarating sequence, we see Kilgore's Huey armada sweeping in on the seaside village with the morning sun behind them and Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries blaring from their loudspeakers.  It culminates with a devastating air strike on hidden gun positions which have shot down a chopper, prompting Kilgore to utter the hallmark line, \\"I love the smell of napalm in the morning...it smells like victory.\\"<br />Coppola's film then progressively gets darker and more surreal the farther the PBR makes its way upriver for Willlard's rendezvous with the mystery of Kurtz.  The deeper the motley group goes into the jungle and the more distant they are from the \\"world,\\" the weirder things get.  And Willard (and the viewer) begins to wonder: what made Kurtz turn his back on the tactics officially endorsed by the Army and the Pentagon?  Why was he being sent to kill Kurtz?  What made the generals and politicians who ran the war any better than Kurtz?<br />Apocalypse Now is famous for having been difficult to make and for being controversial.  When the Pentagon refused to allow Coppola to use its aircraft and equipment, the Oscar-winning (The Godfather Parts I and II) director turned to the Philippine Army, which lent its Hueys and other \\"toys\\" to the production.  It's also well known that Martin Sheen suffered a heart attack during filming.<br />What is somewhat not widely known is that Apocalypse Now was once a project George Lucas was heavily involved in.  As one of Coppola's co-founders of American Zoetrope,  Lucas and Coppola's collaborator John (Red Dawn) Milius came up with many of the ideas incorporated into the final film.  According to Dale Pollock's 1983 biography \\"Skywalking: The Life and Films of George Lucas,\\" the concept of the journey to Kurtz via a boat was Lucas'.  Lucas had also wanted badly to direct Apocalypse Now, but when the production schedule dragged on and planning for Star Wars got underway, Coppola refused to wait till the science fiction film was finished to begin production of Apocalypse Now.  He had set a release date for 1976, the Bicentennial year, and if Lucas went off to direct Star Wars, that date would be set back by a year. He refused to budge, and Lucas went his separate way.  As it turned out, production problems, including a typhoon and Sheen's illness, slowed down production anyway and the film was released in 1979.  (If you look closely, though, you'll see a visual homage to Coppola's friend and protege: the intelligence officer played by Harrison Ford wears a name tag with the name Lucas on his fatigues jacket.)<br />The original Paramount Widescreen Collection DVD (not to be confused with the more recent Apocalypse Now Redux) is a barebones offering.  Its single disc only has English subtitles, English and French audio tracks, the original theatrical trailer, a scene called \\"Destruction of Kurtz Compound\\" which has the only bit of director's commentary by Coppola, and excerpts from the original theatrical program.udge, and Lucas went his separate way.

B000065VB9|4.0|Definately not.  It takes a genius to put out something this unusually perfect.  This is basically a gathering of musical greats, all on the same page.  Gregory, and Weller on guitar, and Robert Fripp on the frippertronics.  Jerry Marotta and Phil Collins on the skins, and Tony Levin as the anchor on Bass.  Intruder creeps into your head and leaves an uneasy feeling.  If you've seen the video, I Don't Remember is his way of letting go of his Genesis past, and it's a great song that stays with you.  Levin's driving bass makes this a classic.  Games Without Frontiers, Family Snapshot, Not one of Us, and Biko are all outstanding tracks.  There really isn't a bad track on here.  Peter Gabriel III, Melt,  is kind of a Socio-political stand that you can identify with on many levels.  It's both musically and lyrically deep, and when you've finished listening to it, you're left wondering if there is something your're missing.  It's uneasy and beatiful all at the same time.

B000067CPX|5.0|People say that RHCP are too pop, that their music has gone too soft. To which I answer flatly: No, you're wrong. They have not gone pop at all, Just the opposite. Pop stuff is mind-dullingly repetitive with the same basic backbeats and crappy lyrics, while RHCP continues too expand its horizons with every new release. They have great vocals, varied approaches with instrumental stuff, etc. So let me tell you what's so great about this CD that I'm giving it 5 stars, eh? Well, for one thing, the 5th track, Don't Forget Me, is just amazing. I'm a bit biased becuase I'm a drummer, but the music behind the vocals on this song is unbelievable. Awe-inspiring. Every night I would stay up listening to this 10, sometimes 20 times in a row, because every time I heard it I had to hear it again. The lyrics fit perfectly too. Then you have &quot;Tear&quot; which receives the same comments, and then so does a song at the end of the CD that a lot of people underappreciate, &quot;Venice Queen&quot;. Something in this song makes me feel complete. When I have trouble getting through the day, this song picks me up off my feet. That's its purpose...another great thing about this CD. All the songs, though very different, each fulfill a purpose within the CD. The only song on this CD I have trouble listening to is &quot;Warm Tape&quot;. Everything else ranges to good to great, to excellent, to outstanding to mindblowing...you get the idea. If you have money inyour pocket and you do not buy this CD immediately your soul will be sold to the devil, it is essential to survival.
B000005HLV|5.0|This is by far the best gospel band I have evar heard!  They are not afraid to show their true faith!  They sing songs about how much love our lord gives us and how we can get through troubled times by trusting our lord and loving each other.  I'm so happy to see that they even don two crosses on their band name just to show even more their love for Christ!  <br />Songs about love, God, and our faith show that Christianity is not dead in music.  And with His power it shall only grow larger.  <br />Some other wonderful Christian gospel bands worth listening to are: Emperor, Mercyful Fate, Marduk, Mortiis, Rotting Christ, and Satanica (who show how evil and bad our Dark Lord is).  Merry listening fellow god lovers!
0790736039|4.0|This horror film about a demented clown who preys on innocent children is great. I recomend it for all horror fans such as myself. It is two parts but the second part is hard to find. I am searching for it at this time and if anyone knows where it is please email me at precizprincez86@aol.com It's a movie you won't regret watching and I would appreciate any help in finding the second half of it!
B000068IEU|1.0|I saw this back in college, and didn't think much of it then...Very unremarkable. Now, 18 years later (wow), I came across this again on DVD and was interested in the extras.  I also thought perhaps my tastes had changed over the years and maybe I would like it.<br />Truth be told, I don't remember much of this film at all from the college years.  And I imagine I will forget it again, this time for good.<br />It's like a bad John Waters movie without the humor.  The music doesn't belong on the soundtrack.  The acting is really bad, and the movie is just plain unremarkable and really sick-minded.<br />As to the extras, it is interesting to see Craven actually partake in interviews and the obligatory commentary track, only because this is such an embarrassing mess.  From the outtakes, you learn that the movie was originally titled &quot;Night of Vengeance&quot;.  There are extended outtakes that show the disembowlment of one of the victims, and this goes on FOREVER!  Also, all of the outtakes are silent, as the sound portion was lost years ago.<br />Anyway, it IS interesting to see where the creator of Nightmare on Elm Street, et al, started, but that's about where the value of this film ends. Save your money for the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre!

B000006OBQ|5.0|This is a great Frank Live album. I don't know where to begin. Not only does he sound great singing these wonderful songs such as The Shadow of Your Smile, The September of My Years, One For My Baby (And One More For The Road),You Make Me Feel So Young, Don't Worry 'bout Me, Luck Be A Lady, which are my favourite on the album. He puts 100% his heart and soul into the entire album. Also, it doesn't hurt, to hear his voice which I love. The man is so charming. You can tell Frank really enjoyed his time with the audience. His cracking up jokes, and being the cool and charming man he always is. Ol' Blue eyes fans you won't be disappointed with this purchase. It's one of my favourite Live albums of his.

And was i the only one hoping the child catcher would lock up the children forever as i was fed up with their dreadful cockney screetchers. <BR>Dick Van Dyke was no good in Mary Poppins and is no good in this.

This was a very easy book to read and very easy to understand.  But just because it is easy to read that doesn't mean that it isn't any good.  This book touches you in a very special very personal way.  He talks about how people need to get over the worldly things like money, social life, and being \\"successful.\\"  They need to live life like there is no tomorrow and tell people how much you love them and care about them.<br /> Tuesdays with Morrie is a great book that everyone should read.  To learn about Morrie and they amazing and unique way that he faced death.  It is a very inspirational story for everyone to read.  This book will make you think about things that you try to push into the back of your mind and not worry about them.  It will change the way you think of life.  If you want to read a great, inspirational book that you'll want to read over and over again this is the one for you.

0553277472|2.0|Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is about a guy, Robert Persig, that goes on a motorcycle trip with his son, Chris.  The purpose of the trip was for Robert to discover himself, to find out more about his past before he went insane.  I had a very hard time reading this book, and I didn't really enjoy it either.<br /> This book was the hardest book I have ever had to read.  This was because of Persig's rambling on of stupid, random thoughts and philosophies.  Through out his trip he talks about many philosophies that will bore you to death.  His great quest to find the meaning of Quality is unbelievably confusing and just plain stupid.  After reading this book every time someone mentions the word Quality you will want to punch him/her in the face.  He goes into such great detail about so many random thoughts and ideas that the book seems to never end.  <br /> I am very proud of myself for actually reading this book in its entirety.  I had such a hard time focusing and trying to understand this book and Persig's random thoughts that I dreaded having to even look at this book.  I suggest reading through this horrible book so that from then on it will make you appreciate every other book that you read.

1587990717|5.0|The book it seems to be correponds to intellectual treatment of variations around the survivorship bias (the fact that in a highly random environment one sees only winner and makes flawed generalizations about the properties of the system). Taleb should have perhaps mentioned something about the anthropic principle (it falls right into the argument) --but perhaps his constituents might not want to be overloaded with so many side points. Nevertheless the Anthropic principle deserves a discussion should the author continue the book. Since he seems to be rewriting chap 11 he should add the anthropic principle somewhere.<BR>Taleb has chosen more biology than physics alas --there are some strenths in the biological discussions as he goes into himself --but going into oneself is not sufficient.  Intospection is the beginning of science but not science. It is good for a personal essay but science is not built on personal essays.<BR>Still 5 stars because he goes deep into arguments and into himself but there are some things missing nevertheless
B000092ZYX|2.0|I was feverishly anticipating this album, and when I bought I didn't like what I heard. I find Radiohead's music very accessible and can like one of their songs on the first listen. But this album does not make me happy like other Radiohead albums do. It doesn't really have on objective, I hate to say this but it sounds like Thom Yorke, the Greenwood Bros. and company are starting to go pop. This album is like non-convincing theatre rock. It tries to sound really dark and dramatic but it's not. It doesn't sound like any effort or emotion was put into this, like it was thrown together in a couple of weeks and put it on sale. <br />Hopefully, Radiohead will ante up a little the next album.<br />PS: Awesome title, Dean 2004!!!!!!
B00005ASOI|2.0|i gave this film two stars only because of its stylized camera shots,and the use of the creepy music was a good choice but it all leads up to a bunch of nothing.<BR>one over the top bloody death at the begining and a dog that turns on its owner by tearing at it's neck.<BR>only to conclude with the killing of a witch that snores real scary and is invisible!!!<BR>this is not the scariest movie ever.<BR>i think it just might be the worst however.

B00000ILGL|5.0|Back in the late 70's there was this thing called LP's. They were like today's 12&quot; singles , but they had different songs on them. They could only hold about 35 minutes of music. Also, recording technology wasn't was it is today. When you release an album from the 70's on CD in it's original format, it will seem short compared to today's 70 to 80 minutes of music on a single CD (usually filled with throw-away filler). Back in the 70's, music producers were not fixated with blasting the world with bass. The music to today's ears doesn't sound loud.<br />With that in mind, if you weren't old enough to hear this music in the 70's, this will not sound right to you. But, you have to listen to this with the history in mind.<br />Moroder was THE pioneer in electronic pop music. His groundbreaking work on Donna Summer's 1977 &quot;I Feel Love&quot; was the first time a song without &quot;real&quot; instruments hit the Top 40.<br />Moroder's work then paved the way for the 80's synth pop revolution.

After all, it seemed to me everyone either loved the book or hated it.  I was curious to see which camp I fell into.<br />Luther and Nora Krank live in a nice neighborhood, make good money, and pretty much have an enviable life.  When their daughter Blair joins the Peace Corps and announces that she'll be gone for a few years, the Kranks sit down and think: \\"Hey, Blair's gone...we're tired of all the time and money we spend on Christmas commercialism and keeping up with the Joneses...Let's skip Christmas this year!\\"<br />But word gets out around the neighborhood: The Kranks aren't going to have a Christmas tree, OR a Frosty the Snowman on their roof, OR buy Christmas cards, or anything related to the holidays.  Instead, they're going on a cruise.  It's not long before the Kranks become public enemies Nos. 1 &amp; 2 on Hemlock Street.<br />Grisham, to his credit, has produced a good look at the insanity of the holiday season and how it affects us all.  He does cleverly expose our crazy holiday thinking, our commercialism, and our lack of recognizing the true meaning of the holiday.  But I wish the book had been a little more hard-hitting and a little less \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\"-ish.

Sometimes, I skip some of the songs<BR>to hear other songs on the album but I try to <BR>listen to them all when I listen to the CD. <BR>I first heard about them, on the radio with their<BR>song Bring me to life. Which I totally fell in love<BR>with the first time I heard it! So I had to buy their<BR>CD! And I'm glad that I did, cos it's the best CD!<BR>And I also think that the best songs are: Going Under,<BR>and Bring me to life, and Taking over me. If you <BR>don't have this CD yet, I suggest you go out there and buy it today! ;)
B00009V8Z9|5.0|After seeing the video for Follow Through on VH1, I could not stop thinking about the song.  It took me all of a couple days to finally get the album, but I am sure glad I did.  Out of the 11 songs on the album, I really enjoy 9.  The music is very mature and personal -- the lyrics seem to truly represent Gavin's take on things.  Gavin's vocal style is great.  I'm a big fan of Jason Mraz, David Gray, Dave Matthews, and Van Morrison and Gavin's truly up with these guys.  This is a great first album and more great things are sure to come.
B000002UB6|5.0|I'm not sure I get the re-release of &quot;Let it Be&quot; in de-Spectorized form. (Maybe Paul just didn't like Phil Spector? Or maybe &quot;Let It Be&quot; has other origins than I might think- was it something they kept saying to Phil while he sat at the mixing board until Paul came back with the song of that name?). This couldn't have been the only album from the 60s &amp; 70s to be suspected of being overproduced (understatement of decade), are they going to go back and fix them all? - But it's history, it's the way it was released, and I've been listening to this for so long now that if I notice changes in the re-release, it's likely to sound uncomfortably strange, and... &quot;Let It Be&quot; as in, &quot;don't change it,&quot; would be probably fine with me.<br />To tell the truth, I never could never really hear the Phil Spector in it, it had to have been overpowered by the Beatles' own writing and presence, just as it would be hard to deny they seemed to want to &quot;Get Back&quot; to a certain raw, live, more spontaneous, less &quot;canned in the studio&quot; sound, and they got it here so successfully that it's always getting wrongly accused of being rough and sloppy, rather than the &quot;stuck in a blender with reverb, sacharine &amp; strings&quot; (well, okay, but &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; is begging for orchestration and it works, well) that might instantly come to mind with the word &quot;overproduced&quot;.<br />I'm not even sure I like the idea of track changes. &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; is a great song that's worth of album space, but ditching &quot;Maggie May&quot; and &quot;Dig It&quot; may not be so much removing the fingerprints of Phil Spector, as the fingerprints of something else the Beatles might have wanted to &quot;Get Back&quot; to here, which is just plain having a not-so-stuffy good time. They're such short numbers I can't imagine their omission making so much room that they shouldn't have been included too. <br />That must sound like making much out of little, but I always thought there was an idea, a philosophy, with &quot;Get Back&quot;. I am a little confused where it's going to think the least slick &amp; serious stuff is going out the window even for what short numbers they were, and I can't quite picture what &quot;Let It Be&quot;- and its spirit- is going to become (Not a lot of point even talking about the songs because it's hard to think of a bad song the Beatles, as the Beatles, wrote, starting clear back at Revolver), but whatever this album turns into, you may just want this, too, for what it was, and is. I could try to be more critical, but in all these years there hasn't really ever been anything I'd have actually asked them to change, and the &quot;Let It Be That Is,&quot; was plenty.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|A Perfect Circle has done it again, left me completly speechless, with the newest album... bought it 2 nights ago stuck it in the CD player and was blown away, by the lyrics and the music on this CD... If you hear anyone who says this new CD sucks, kick them in the neck. because obviously this person has no talent or they dont appreciate good music
B0000AXE8I|1.0|There is nothing in this sequel that brings new meaning to the Matrix. <br />The script is ridiculous, there is no climax because there is no challenge: NEO can do anything he wants, fly, dodge bullets, resurrect. <br />Morpheus is now nothing more than a lunatic, delusional freedom warrior. Zion is a joke. <BR>Dialogs are mechanical and have no flow whatsoever. <br />The only thing amazing in this movie are the FX.
B0000TB05A|5.0|Filmed on the 1st September 2001, U2 Go Home is the first ever release to feature U2 playing to a home crowd in Ireland.<br />Following an 80 date sell-out world tour, U2 headed home for two extraordinary outdoor shows at Slane Castle in Ireland, where the band played to more than 160,000 people.<br />This homecoming concert will be released on DVD by Universal Island Records on November 17th.<br />U2 Go Home charts an emotional return for the band: in 1984 it was at Slane Castle where the band had recorded their landmark fourth album, an event which was captured in The Unforgettable Fire documentary. The documentary is released with the new DVD, re-mastered and re-graded for the first time.<br />The Elevation shows also marked the 20th anniversary of the band's first appearance at Slane, supporting another legendary Irish rock band Thin Lizzy, at the inaugural Slane Castle Festival.<br />The new DVD includes a bonus track, and DVD ROM special features include U2 calendar, screensavers and weblinks plus three songs shot on `Spincam' allowing the viewer an interactive, 360 degree view of the concert.
B000089RVR|4.0|From the word go, you can tell that there's a definite thematic narrative to the lyrics on this follow-up album from Dido. More personal, more soul, more autobiographical and sadly, a little bit more cynical than No Angel.<br />To walk through the numbers here, \\"White Flag\\" sets off with a racy beat but contains lyrics of a woman brooding what was most likely a melancholy affair. \\"Stoned\\" is even racier, and has a chorus that's difficult to dislodge from your memory, you'll be humming it for a while (as I was.) \\"Life for Rent\\" is where Armstrong gets a little cynical. Beautiful lyrics, but you shouldn't mind lack of an identifiable rhythm. \\"Mary's in India,\\" is a slow ballad backed only by guitar strings. Somewhat of a chick-song.  \\"See when you're forty,\\" nice U2-like beats, but not a spectacular tune. Listenable still. \\"Don't Leave Home,\\" and \\"Who Makes You Feel\\" are light, but well-paced numbers. \\"Sand In My Shoes\\" gets all Lobo-like, it is to music what chick-lit is to literature. \\"DO you have a little time,\\" - excellent number! Sounds a bit drugged, like Poe or Garbage's music.<br />In the end, the album leaves a mixed taste. Its best moments suggest that Dido's success is founded on a songwriting talent so undeniable that even people who don't really like music cannot help but be charmed. But it also has moments that remind you of her first album, a couple of songs bear quite close a semblance.<br />Either way, it isn't going to change anyone's mind about Dido. One could argue this isn't spectacularly different, but it’s a well-produced album and gives you a good deal listenable variety, particularly if you like Dido's intelligent non-trivial pop music.<br />Give it a try!
B00003CXCW|5.0|As a film critic says in one of the interviews on this splendid special edition, Billy Wilder not only had the craft, style and elegance we associate with classic Hollywood, he also had a biting wit that appeals to the sensibilities of today.  This film has aged much better than it's central villian, the demented starlet portrayed to perfection by real-life demented starlet Gloria Swanson.  William Holden's (literally) dead-pan narration as a two-bit screenwriter of B-movies is as sad and funny as it ever was.<br />The documentary on the disc does a good job of demonstrating just how unique the tone of this story is, how it perfectly navigates between funny and sad.  Not everyone in Hollywood saw the funny side when it was released, and it lost to ALL ABOUT EVE at that year's Oscars.  So what?  With this disc, SUNSET BOULEVARD is finally getting it's due.<br />Besides the documentary, you can read two screenplay drafts of an excised opening sequence, explore 1950's Hollywood with an interactive map and watch the film with audio commentary by a critic and historian.  All these features are secondary, of course, to the movie.  It looks gorgeous.  The black and white picture is rich and crisp, the sound is re-mastered and the story is as compelling as ever.  The special features only do what all good special features should do on a DVD.  They add to the richness of the film.  You may already know that Eric von Stroheim (who plays a character who directed Gloria Swanson's character in silent films) directed Gloria Swanson in silent films.  But did you know that the drugstore where all the screenwriter's hang out in the movie is the drug store where F. Scott Fitzgerald had a heart attack in 1940?  One of the reasons I love this movie is because it is so rich with Hollywood history.<br />I can't recommend this disc highly enough.  Kudos to Columbia for doing right by a classic, a real film lover's film.  I love this movie and I love this disc!  5/5 stars.
6302824613|5.0|As a '60s afficionado I finally got around to seeing this great psychedelic mindblower of a film. It starts off slow....enter Ursula Andress.  There are at least 100 beautiful European girls in this film and I can see Woody Allen's motivation to kill all men taller than him so he can get them all. As the film takes off you realize that you have to be on Acid to understand the plot, as everyone remotely connected with this film must've been. The sets range from a Scottish castle to a Berlin haunted house to Orson Wells' psychedelic torture chamber complete with mod spiral funhouse rooms, and it gets more bizarre from there. Great music by Burt Bacharach (The Look of Love).<br />  Has cameos from practically every British star of the time, has a Spaceship full of Woody's duplicate World Leaders...it has everything. What can I say, if you like the '60s you'll love this if you possess that '60s Psychodelic Consciousness that is.
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|I bought/listened to the new APC album last night, and although there are no hooks and/or real songs and the seriousness of it all is suffocating, it does have this sort of brooding energy that never actually explodes, which is compelling and interesting to a certain extent.<br />I think the drums have an interesting diversity to them- at times it sounds like Freese is recording them in a closed-door gymnasium or in the living room in front of you.  The bass is predictable and throw-away, because Billy is not a good bassist--he's a guitarist.  The guitars are generally cool, but in that &quot;Unforgettable Fire&quot; way.  What I mean by this is that there are no well-defined riffs, but rather textures, and heavily picked passages that create a general sound canvas.  On the &quot;Unforgettable Fire&quot; this made my hair stand on end, but Howerdel doesn't really come close in this regard.  His tone is generally quite glassy and his notes are only mildly interesting.  The lack of memorable riffs or hooks is a bad thing, and might explain the lack of strong impression I have from listening to the CD.<br />Maynard's vocals are beginning to grate on me because I think they are just plain not good.  The lyrics are interesting, but his vocal melodies (when he does actually sing, which seems rare on the CD because he talks/quasi-sings or whispers so much) are uninspired, frankly.  Particularly on the second or third song when he has that sort of yelping peak to the chorus.  Unlistenable.  It's so much better when he wails and sings things like, &quot;And you know I will always love you, as I throw your f*cking throat away...&quot;<br />Please don't let others know what goes on at Perfect Circle studios or we'll have bucketloads of albums with icy cold production jobs.  While Wallace's mixing job was pretty good with a light-handed approach to panning and such <BR>(something Tool tastelessly does), it lacks the typical warmth the most compelling albums tend to have.<br />One final thing: I think the aesthetic of this album is nice and new: it's very dense and brooding, and I believe it resolves.  I'm fairly certain it's conceptually about death and or dying, and there's a resolution.  It's a fairly complete work.  However, APC will need to expand on this, because <BR>they have maxed this out.  The first album was full of hooks, choruses, and 3-minute songs.  This follow-up CD begins with a song that is 7 1/2 minutes long, and the album goes on and on with indistinguishable guitar parts and meandering vocals.  I would not go so far as to say it is an ill-disciplined <BR>work, but I would say if they continue to be somewhat one-dimensional in their aesthetic (i.e., poker-faced without any humor or groove), APC will collapse from all the weight.  For the listeners as least.
B000002JSJ|4.0|Presence is often overlooked, which is unfortunate because I believe it is one of the great Led Zeppelin albums. Certainly, I have listened to it more than any of the others. We all know the background by now: Robert Plant breaks his leg in a car accident, forcing the cancellation of the band's tour. To make up for this, the band rushes into the studio to hash out their album in a very short amount of time. How did they do this? The answer is very simple - great riffs. Without time to over-conceptualize the music, Page saves the day by reaching into his bag and pulling out a collection of some of his most infectious guitar riffs, played by the band in a straight, hard-rocking guitar-bass-drums format. Musically, the sound is very similar to material such as the famous riff that makes up the main part of &quot;The Ocean&quot; (from Houses of the Holy) or &quot;Kashmir&quot; (from Physical Graffiti). The riffs are blues-based hard rock, articulated with very funky rhythms. Definitely, this is their funkiest album, an element which the other proto-metal bands were never able to (or interested in) mastering. The bass, drum, and guitar playing is top-notch and exciting throughout. Robert Plant's vocals and lyrics complement the music perfectly. At this point, the band had been doing what they did for so long that it was great for circumstance to intervene and force them to take a fresh approach.<br />The way they re-work Blind Willie Johnson's &quot;Nobody's Fault But Mine&quot; is brilliant, with a funky rhythm and lots of tricky drum and bass work. Plant's singing is also great here. &quot;Hots On For Nowhere&quot; is also great, with some outstanding singing and great guitar riffing (sounding like a 1950s Sun Studios sound updated with funky rhythms). And I think everyone agrees that the album's highlight is the opener, &quot;Achilles Last Stand.&quot; It's an uptempo number that chugs along for almost 10 minutes, driven by Bonham's relentless drumming, a chugging bass line by Jones, layer upon layer of brilliantly composed guitar lines by Page, and Plant's epic story on top. It's one of their greatest songs.<br />Of course, a drawback for some people is the lack of variety. The songs do seem cut from the same mold for the most part, and there is a sameness from song to song.  The album does not offer the orchestral vision of their earlier albums. Part of this might have to do with the fact that Jones sticks to bass exclusively here, so there is not the variety of textures that he usually brings with keyboards. It's all definitely guitar-driven hard rock. There are no acoustic numbers, and no real ballads, unless you count the slow blues &quot;Tea For One.&quot; A slow song such as &quot;Ten Years Gone&quot; would have worked great here, as would a more melodious number like &quot;Over the Hills and Far Away.&quot; The band's tender, reflective side is not in evidence here at all, nor are their mystical inclinations.  Throughout, there is a mood of urban world-weariness that in my opinion represents the band's most honest interpretation of what we call &quot;the blues&quot; - in this case, the blues that come from rock superstardom stardom and all the decadence that comes with that territory. Which is not to say that band is spent - this album proves that when the chips were down, Led Zeppelin relied on their fundamental strengths - great riffs, power, and bluesy themes - to pull them through. Don't overlook this great, vital Led Zeppelin album.
B0000009SE|5.0|This album is full of great music, but check out Hot Rats and The Grand Wazoo first.
B00005JLTN|5.0|I don't like the ending because it makes me wait several months to find out what happens.  Besides that it is a wonderful movie.  If someone watches it that hasn't seen the Matrix (one) or didn't comprehend the Matrix then they are definitely not going to comprehend this movie.  I will say this I was completely satisfied with spending my money on this movie after the first 20 minutes of the film.  I recommend that if you haven't saw this film that you watch the first one again first before you watch this one.  This movie is totally cool and I would give it 10 stars if I could.
B0000009SF|5.0|Hot Rats is wonderful, the fact that this album is even better amazes me
0380002930|5.0|Watership Down, by Richard Adams, is a tale that shows courage, determination, teamwork, human nature, ethics and adventure. It can't be said to be about one thing. One subject in this book is rabbits living in a village must flee their habitats, because of destruction by land developers. The rabbits try to search for a safe place, but every corner they turn, danger meets them. Character development is extraordinary, many of the characters are just like humans, because they are talking animals. Adam's uses old folk writing styles, with a \\"lapine\\" glossary for the language of rabbitese.
B0000009RT|5.0|Never before has a musician flexed his songwriting muscles as much as Zappa did on the first MOI album. A must!
B000000OSE|5.0|Guns N' Roses is and probably always will be one of my favorite bands.Despite what some may say,IMHO there is no filler on this album.Every song is classic.
B0000009S3|5.0|This album is one of Zappa's finest, and plus it has Captain Beefheart on &quot;Willie the Pimp&quot;. Buy it!
B000089RVR|5.0|I seriously thought No Angel was going to be the highlight of Dido's career. It was a brilliant album that was hard to top. When I heard Life For Rent I was amazed at the depth of the songs, and the quality of her voice(which shows more range that in No Angel). My two favourite songs on the album are 'White Flag' and 'Sand In My Shoes'. The chorus on 'Sand In My Shoes' is probably one of the best ever.
B0000009SM|5.0|This album is one of the greatest things to ever be put down on tape. Inca Roads is worth the p.o.a alone! All the songs on the record are simply amazing. Buy this now!
B0000AXE8I|4.0|I have to admit, I, along with everyone else in the known world, was somewhat disappointed with Matrix II.  Well, I've had about 6 momths to get over my disappointment and settled down to watch it again in the privacy of my home entertainment center and you know something....it's not such a bad movie.  In fact, Now that the movie doesn't have to compete with my expectations, I enjoyed a lot better.  I also understand a bit more about the gangsters and how they could exist in the matrix.  I still have issues with the Zion orgy/sex scene, That did go on about five minutes too long.  But otherwise, I feel much different about the movie as a whole.<BR>That being said, where was the menu on the first disk?
B0000009SY|5.0|This is one of my favorite Zappa albums, everything just seems to click. Some of the best music Zappa recorded can be found here. If you do not have this album you are not a Zappa fan.
1587990717|2.0|Very good subject, its sort of an applied probability book with discussions on financial trading. Also some disussion of the psychology of competition. That's good stuff, but the author keeps throwing his own persona into it, and he's kind of obnoxious, to put it politely. Its like a Saturday Night Live character giving an economics class or something. But not quite as funny. If you can get past that though, it's a decent book. I'd like to read more about the subject, but by someone else.
B0000009RX|5.0|The MOI are great. This album will prove it if you have any doubts.
B000031WD9|5.0|I couldn't stop laughing.  Rent the DVD it's worth the laughs.
B0000009TJ|5.0|This album has a great mix of covers and originals. Zappa's live band at their best!
B00003CXB4|5.0|This movie easily makes it into my top 10 movies list.  But everyone already knows/owns/or at least has seeen this movie, so... is the DVD worth buying?<br />I would have to say yes.  They put a lot of effort into making the picture sharp and colors \\"spot on\\".<br />I personally find the commentary fascinating, and my 5 year old loves the virtual safari.<br />Some of the extras are hideous (like the \\"Circle of Friends\\" singing \\"The Circle of Life\\"), but some people's trash...<br />Anyway, the movie quality alone is worth the DVD.
B00006399Z|5.0|my review is fairly tainted by my initial liking of this record .. this was one of my first records that I had when I was growing up in Calcutta, India ..   I have not had this album for the last 9 years and bought it last month from Amazon.Ca ..  must have heard it a hundred times in my previous life and all the memories came rushing back .. didn't forget a chord, not one beat .. had every nuance saved in my brain ..   One of the most creative and enjoyable live sessions .. just wish it was longer than 45 minutes ..   Compared among last exit and on the road .. the other two traffic live albums, my preference would be for this one based on sheer artistic quality ..   enjoy!
B0000C8AVM|5.0|What I like best about &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot; is its atmosphere of intimacy and nobility.<br />Dylan's strange, compelling voice is as tuneful in this album as it had ever been when he was very young, but because he is older here, it has a kind of fatigue built into it, which gives it a depth of character that makes it more expressive and moving.  This is something of a stroke of luck, because within a few years his voice became downright thin, a shell of its former self.<br />The songs themselves are also expressive and engagingly personal, which is unusual for Dylan, who more often goes for prophetic and inscrutable.  I get the feeling that he recorded &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot; at a time when the roller coaster of his life had dumped him in a very ambivalent place, leaving him full of regrets but still, upon reflection, ultimately happy about who he is.  The album feels like a &quot;taking stock,&quot; like the sound of a man who is confessing to the world--and to the people he loves--that he is a human being, full of frailty but full of affection and wisdom.  Kind of a mature theme!  Different than those psychedelic mid-sixties albums.<br />A very cleansing, well-crafted record of poetic popular music.  To my mind, clearly Dylan's best.
B00005JMEW|5.0|From the beginning, this movie has Quinten stamped all over it.Hannah (although a minor bit in Vol 1), Uma, Lucy, Michael and the presence of Carradine as Bill (we ain't seen him yet!) are awesome in their parts...............and don't miss the nasty little schoolgirl Go Go....she never stop stops....well til she meets The Bride anyway!<BR>A great ride for those who can handle the pace and see a little humor in the absurdity that can be Japanese Manga.....a real Saturday afternoon at the movies!
B00005NI5Y|5.0|What makes \\"Love and Theft\\" so enjoyable isn't just the witty one-liners and general silliness (and a few very revelatory moments, like \\"Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff\\"), it's that Dylan, by now, is so much a part of his own myth that for some reason when he jokes about Shakespeare it seems right. Who else has that authority, and when they're being so darn goofy? He may be the only musician of his age who hasn't descended into a heaviness that makes listening to him a chore -- he's perpetually a lanky Midwestern teenager bouncing around with mood swings.<br />And the album swings. The band is so relaxed that their riffing comes off as spontaneous. In the age of digital everything and perfected guitar licks, it's such a joy to hear Charlie Sexton's guitar rolling around the record. And like the best music, it may take a while before you actually hear what you're listening to -- it took me about a year to really catch the smirking violin on \\"Floater.\\" There's more nature and sepia toned history on this record than on nearly any Dylan album before, and it's sung by someone who's practically a part of both. But don't let that fool you -- the album has as much apocalypse rumble as \\"Time Out of Mind\\" had slow, distant suicide.<br />As great as the early Dylan records are, they're \\"personal\\" albums -- for us. You can't really put them on for a group of people. First of all, an acoustic guitar and a nasally voice isn't much to fill a room with, and you'd be focusing on his words. (The words here are worth focusing on, too, but that goes without saying, right?) \\"Time Out of Mind\\" has solid music -- it's an album you put on for your depressed friends to listen to in the background. \\"Love and Theft\\" is what you put on after, to make them put the razor down. I'm excited to think about where he takes us next.
B0000009SI|5.0|This is possibly one of the best &quot;rock&quot; albums Zappa ever recorded. Many suprises await you on repeated listens.
B000028U0Y|5.0|I don't think I can add much to the reviews already here, but this album is tremendous. The mix and ordering of songs is perfect, and Cash's voice brings them all home nicely. The CD starts with the famous Folsom Prison Blues and continues with a bunch of dark, prison-related tunes. After The Wall, which is the darkest of the all, Cash switches gears into a few humorous tunes to lighten the mood, then brings in June Carter to sing with him. The CD ends with  what is probably my favorite track--the soul-stirring Greystone Chapel, written by one of the inmates.<br />Buy this album. You won't regret it.
B00005JM4Z|5.0|I watched this movie because...to be honest...I was bored and<br />my husband recently bought the DVD.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I loved it, the coloring, action, camera work...the characters were all fabulous.  I never would have thought I would have liked it...I was wrong!  Now I need to watch the first movie!
B00005V9IJ|2.0|Many reviews already, so let me keep this brief. The movie never bored me but also didn't really 'get going'. It was nice and all that (slightly interesting), yet I felt that after walking away from it, there had been too many missed opportunities which might have lifted the feature above a mere ordinary level.<br />Tom Hanks gave a fine performance, though his character seldom appeared realistic to me (that's just me). My main concern would be the forced ending. It was, in my opinion, not worked out fully. This had nothing to do with Hanks or Hunt, to be sure.<br />Still, Cast Away looks good and realistic (except for the computer-made fish). I thought the crash of the plane worthy of special mention. But after Hanks got off the island, things went 'somewhat wrong'.<br />Well, not wasted time, and I'm sure a lot of people have and will like it. My ** might be a bit harsh.
B00006879E|5.0|This band is AWESOME.  I bought the CD after seeing them live opening up for Matchbox 20.  I had never heard of them before the concert.  Let me just tell you, I was blown away!  The singer also writes all the songs and he is also a guitarist.  The keyboardist really adds to the funky tunes.  I like the mix of their songs.  Some are rock, some funky, some bluesy, and some even jazzy.  I keep this CD in my car and never take it out.  I listen from beginning to end without flipping through one song.  I have since seen them again live and they nevertheless blew me away again.  I even got to meet Adam, the lead singer, and Jesse, the keyboardist.  They were so friendly and down to earth.  Buy this CD, and you will be equally impressed!!!!!!!
B0000AXE8I|5.0|Since we're rating the DVD version here, I'll give you 2 separate reviews: one for the film itself, and one for the DVDs.<br />The Film<BR>The second installment of this ongoing story answers more questions and leaves us with just as many as the original.  I don't know whether to feel more or less at ease, because I'm still left in the dark as to what's going on EXACTLY.  I would expect more of an explanation from the third one, however, I also don't expect to be spoon-fed the answers.  Obviously this film offers the simplest (and yet most complex) form of entertainment: visuals.  Amazing work was done in this film, from the fights to Zion to the special camera effects which placed them in impossible places (eg. car chase).  Neo has developed his powers further, however, he obviously is not invincible and like Morpheus said, the rules \\"can be bent, not broken.\\"  What solidifies this film as more than just an action movie is the plot.  The script is VERY deep and similar Shakespearean pieces, it takes some analysis to fully grasp all the ideas that are being explained.  If you want to fully enjoy this film, take the time to understand it all.  Then you can decide whether you like it or not.  However, such analysis is not necessary to enjoy the film.  Some complain that certain action scenes were dragged out (car chase, Smith fight), but I found them amazing.  They just seemed to keep going and it blew my mind as they kept adding more to each scene.  They certainly were more amazing than anything to date.  Why does the length annoy people?  So many movies are now 2 hours long (if not 3 hours) and it only seems reasonable.  <br />The DVDs<BR>While one DVD contains the film (which makes it worthwhile all on its own), the other contains all the special features.  I wasn't disappointed in the special features.  It contained more than the average DVD, but didn't go over the top either.  The nicest surprise was the spoof skit from the MTV Movie Awards, especially for thosewho hadn't seen it before.<br />Not that the special features aren't interesting, but because of the close release dates of the 2nd and 3rd installments of the Matrix Trilogy, I would expect a crazy special edition coming out after Revolutions is released, and an extra crazy \\"Trilogy Edition\\" soon after.  If you can't wait, go buy it now, otherwise I'd recommend holding off until the full set comes out later.<br />I've seen this movie well over 10 times now and each time I watch it I pick out something else that aids my understanding of the Matrix world.  Just sit back and enjoy the ride and read into as much as you want.  It resembles the Simpsons or animated movies - you can enjoy the surface humour, but if you look into it further, you can catch the not-so-obvious stuff that truly shows how clever the creators are.  Ergo, enjoy!
B0000009TK|5.0|Out of the three '88 band albums, this is my least favorite, but it is still worth every second you spend with it. Great music within.
B0000AMRJC|1.0|Don't buy this DVD...It blows!!!The sound is garbage...They rave about 5.0..DTS...They should take back these DVDs...I have been waiting so long for this release, only to to be let down...Buy the first version, the picture is not as good but the in stereo sounds better than this...<br />Don't buy...Unless You Want To Buy Mine... :)
B000002JS8|5.0|Everyone knows that AC/DC are the gods of straight-up hard rock songs, songs described in the liner notes of this CD as being about \\"humping and booze.\\"  Yes, AC/DC are established as the masters but it was in 1979 with the release of this album that the whole world learned it.  Please don't take this the wrong way but Bon Scott could not have picked a better time to die, with Highway to Hell as his \\"rock & roll will & testament\\" he will always be remembered as one of the hardest rockers around.  The highlights to this album are, of course, the title track.  The song Touch too Much is a catchy little piece and Walk All Over You has a powerful intro and chorus.  If You want Blood (You've Got It) is a stadium-ready sing-along hit.  Night Prowler is probably the most \\"metal\\" AC/DC song of the Bon Scott period and I consider this a great, great closer.
B00009W0U4|5.0|This has got to be one of the best movies I've ever seen.<br />People that complain about the brutal rape scene need to wake up and face reality. The scene is not there for the sake of shock. The point that the director was trying to make is that rape is brutal and disgusting. Most hollywood movie makers do not have the guts to show horrible things in a realistic light. Perhaps after seeing this movie people will realize how horrible rape can be. Most guys just hear \\"rape\\" on the news and don't think about the violence associated with it. My wife couldn't watch the entire scene and I just fast-forwarded it. If you can't stomach it do the same.<br />Then there are people who complain about the camera movement in this movie which says to me they did not get the movie nor the point. Time is a central element and character of this movie. The constant motion represents time (as it never stands still). Besides the actors in this movie the director has effectively put another character of time into the movie. And the theme is that people always have to deal with time and choices and their irreversible nature. After watching this movie you will have a new way of looking at life (or perhaps re-affirm your beliefs already). Just to put things in perspective to current events - take a look at what happened to that poor Cubs fan in the playoffs. One second he is sitting at a baseball game, rooting for his favorite team, loving life, next second his whole world gets turned upside down because the ball came his way. In a split second his whole life changed because of chance, because of timing, and because of his decision. <br />Our actions and choices in life are irreversible - but do we really have a say in what happens to us or is it predetermined destiny? It's the old philosophical question brought to you in a chilling, sometimes disturbing, but most of all very beautiful movie.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly was one of the most entertaining TV series of the past few decades.  No doubt some will compare it to \\"StarTrek\\" however all of the versions of StarTrek pale in comparison to Firefly.<br />Firefly's characters are intriguing and diverse.  The show is loaded with hints and potential for incredible development of several plots.<br />The DVD release of the first season will be the first TV series I will purchase on DVD.  And it is certainly something I've been looking forward to since the show was cancelled.  The fact that Firefly was cancelled is a mystery that may baffle many of us forever.  Certainly whomever made that decision had no concept of the quality or long term potential of this show.<br />The only thing Firefly lacks is marketing!
B00009V7RF|5.0|I bought this CD the same day that it was released and because so many of my peeps have borrowed it, I now have atleast 5 of these cd's burned and original circlulating. BEP are sooo real some people can't handle them, when you listen to their lyrics, you get exposed to the truth of the world, the government and even the selfishness of people that don't care about the bigger picture than themselves. They understand that hip hop is a culture that needs to be put out there and very much respected and studied, and they see that hip hop goes so much further than just the music. Anybody that is offended, a word of advice, open up your mind when you hear the lyrics and enable yourself to see the difference in what is put out there for &quot;the world&quot; to see and what is the truth and not quite so easily found. The BEP are true examples of knowledge in the world!!
B000002KB8|4.0|Well I bought the CD at On-Cue, and I'm thinking I might have gotten ripped off.  I opened the case to see that there were no liner notes, no lyric booklet, no albm credits or anything.  Just a sheet of paper with the album art on the front, it was blank on the back.  Then I put the CD in my stereo and discovered the track listings on both the case and disc to be in error, they said there were six tracks when in fact there were five.  Although I do believe I still got the right songs.  Figuring out what the real track listing was was not helped much by how all the songs ran together.  Aside from Black Sabbath and The Wizard all the songs started to sound the same anyway, I couldn't tell where one ended and another began.  But maybe I just got a bad copy, this is still a great album don't get me wrong.  The first two tracks are classics and the rest may run together but they form one kick-ass Metal song.  All hail Black Sabbath, the beginning, the end and all hail Metal.

B0000B3FCX|5.0|I feel that Tthe Long Road shows the real potential of Nickelback, although Silver Side UP was also excellent, The Long Road excells that. The Long Road shows how Nickelback can put together a wide range of songs from power ballads such as Someday and my personal favourite, Fellin'Way Too Damn Good and then you have Real ROCK, Metal songs such as, Flat On The Floor which gives an explosive start to the album and Figured You Out which is just so good. They also have added an excellent cover of Elton John's Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting and two other bonus tracks. Altogether a big thumbs up from me and i can really not wait for their next piece of work.
0451191153|2.0|I knew Ayn Rand first as the founder of Objectivism and later as a novelist. I think her capacity as the latter leaves a lot to be desired. Repetitively used is the &quot;tell-me&quot; (v.s. &quot;show-me&quot;) style of narrative: lacking in imaginative language both in the descriptive and intellectual context.<br />It becomes obvious early on what the message is: &quot;individuality is great, blind conformity, not so great&quot;. It becomes more and more obvious in the next 20 times the point is iterated, to the point of tiring. Objectivism aside, I feel there could have been more eloquent,subtle and ultimately effective ways to write a novel as a work of (intellectual) fiction. As a reader, I didn't care much for the characters, and that's a Bad Thing(TM) in my judging of books.
B00000HYXB|5.0|Nightfall in Middle Earth is not just a definitive Power Metal album, it is an essential in any Metal collection.  It's a shining display of rock music.  It is a remarkable achievement in music period.  I had listened to a few Power Metal albums before but this one blew me away, the expert use of synths and layering.  The tempo-changes from a pounding haunting rhythm to an explosion of sheer Metal Madness.  Every song is worth listening to, I do not envy Blind Guardian going on tour to support this and picking which songs to play, I wish they could play all of them.  Each song is a new heigh in Power Metal, but I guess the best ones would be Into the Storm, Nightfall, Blood Tears, Time Stands Still (At the Iron Hill), The Eldar, and A Dark Passage.

This book has been the most helpful that I have found for detailing the numerous tests and variations of each test that SPSS has to offer, especially for someone who is statistics illiterate.

B00000IAU3|5.0|Dido's first claim to fame was a sample from her song \\"Thank You\\" on \\"Stan\\", the story of an obsessed Eminem fan. Her album  had been out for quite a while, but this beautiful voice heard in the chorus of Stan made people want to know who this girl was, giving No Angel a sudden sale boost. But as we all know now, Dido is more than the \\"it's not so bad\\" girl. No Angel is nothing less than a masterpiece, with a sound that is a blend of Jewel-esque folk, pop, trip-hop and electronica (let's not forget that before going solo, she was a part of Faithless , and it  really shows on this album). But what I love about Dido is her lyrics, so simple but poetic and touching at the same time, and her soothing, silky voice. In a desert of oversinging pop divas, Dido is an oasis of fresh air. Her voice, which fits her music perfectly, has the ability to get you in a relaxed mood where you can listen to it for hours without getting annoyed by it. That's more than I can say for the likes of Christina Aguilera and Mariah Carey, who make me want to turn off the radio everytime their songs come on because their constant screaming is unbearable. Plus, she never relies on her looks and sexuality to sell records, unlike the aforementioned gals. Dido doesn't make music to prove she can sing: she does it because she is good at it and because she has a lot of emotions to share. A must-have for anyone who can recognize real talent and good music.
6302787297|5.0|1492: Conquest Of Paradise, is a beautiful, and wonderful looking movie. Not only that, but it's perfect from my standpoint. People would be able to see this film again if a DVD is released. And alot of people would grow to love this movie. Yes, it's about Christopher Columbus, but the movie is about a little more than just him. History wise, I don't know that much about Christopher Columbus, other than just some of the historical facts about him, and the film presents them all reasonably well. History facts aside, the movie does it's job to entertain the viewer, and presents to us a fair interpretation of Columbus and what he accomplished through his life. Ridley Scott, uses the world Columbus inhabits and achieves glorious results, along with working with Vangelis, what we have here is a rare breed of film where the soundtrack and the images, in some scenes in the film work together to make the viewer think about the subject matter. Like in 2001: A Space Oddessy, this is about equal to it, the soundtrack is amazing. Gerard Depardieu provides us with a solid, enjoyable performance, he is so fun to watch on screen in 1492. For a French actor, he is believable as an Italian, because his nose helps, and his accent is abstract and different from the people he associates with to accomplish what he did in Spain at the time. The movie is incredible, it makes you think about life. I think a DVD release by, I think, Paramount, is not just a good idea, rather a necessity, since this film covers such important subject matter for because of Christopher Columbus, we call our home America. I think it's crazy that the studio hasn't released this on DVD yet.

B00008S2VG|1.0|Like a lot of the other reviewers, I own every Madonna album and have been a huge fan of hers from the beginning of her career. I have enjoyed every single album she has made, have them memorized and play them over and over to the point of annoying my family and friends until this album. I have to say when I brought the album home and listened to it for the first time <BR>I was extremely disapointed. Madonna has a great voice she proved this with EVITA. Since then she has gradually gone away from using her natural voice and using synthesizers and other techno stuff to alter her voice.  The first of this \\"new\\" Madonna was \\"Ray of Light\\" which was not bad.  Then \\"Music\\" which also was a good album.  However, on \\"American Life\\" you get all too tired of hearing the techno sounds and altering of the voice it leaves you wanting the Madonna back from the early 80's to mid 90's who brought such hits as \\"Like a Virgin\\" to the beautiful \\"Take a Bow.\\"  I can only listen to three songs on \\"American Life\\" they are \\"Hollywood, Nobody Knows Me, and Mother and Father.\\"  The rest are just garbage. I hope Madonna realizes from the lack of sales in this album that her fans are missing what she does best and that is Sing!

0743455967|5.0|If you're thinking of buying this book to try to figure out the magic formula for how to become a writer like Stephen King then, sorry, you are out of luck.  For one thing, there is no magic formula, so stop looking.  <br />One reviewer complains that King doesn't reveal exactly how he comes up with his stories and how he goes about writing them.  that reviewer either didn't read the book, didn't read the book well, or is completely dense.  King talks about those things exactly!  He doesn't detail it for every book and story he's ever written, but all the answers are right there.  <br />If you want to be a writer, then you're going to have to realize that there is no pat, easy answer to &quot;Where DO you get your ideas?&quot; except maybe &quot;From my head, you dolt.&quot;  <br />I think only people who are meant to be writers will fully understand what king has in that last section, On Writing.  But perhaps the rest of you will enjoy the autobioggraphical parts.  I certainly did.
B00009V7T2|5.0|This album is great.  I'm a huge At the Drive In, and Red Hot Chili Peppers fan and to have Omar Rodriguez, Cedric Bixler, Flea and John Frusciante on one album makes it worth every penny.  Mars Volta rules! Sparta sux!
B00005QIPH|4.0|I read some of the other reviews.....those people must think that they are some kind of authority on music, fortunately I'm not under that illusion.  Forget the hype, and overanalzed reviews.  I like this cd because it puts me in a relaxed, chilled mood at work, and that's not easy to do.  Buy this cd and enjoy it for what it is.

0812550706|3.0|This book was a very interesting book to read, however, I found certain parts of it depressing, and even disturbing.  I hope the world never becomes like it is described in this book.  I like the way Ender wishes he didn't have to kill all those Buggers.  He doesn't want to be a killer, but he smart enough to be one, and is forced into it. That's what I don't like about this book. He is tricked into doing it without knowing that he is really killing the Buggers

B000060MY6|2.0|This was a great movie until, unfortunately, David Lynch has no idea how to end it.  The last part is truly pathetic.  But the acting of the two leads, both women, is wonderful.  Worth a view; what a pity the director didn't have a better writer than himself.
076790382X|5.0|This book is a compilation of columns written by Bill Bryson, and be warned: if you do not like attracting attention to yourself then do not read this book in public. Your imminent guffaws will surely startle anyone within twenty feet. This book is funny, hilarious, charming, and all of the above. Bryson brings to light some rather arresting statistics with humor, wit, and general good nature. The truly great thing about this book is that you can't tell if during a &quot;personal account&quot; Bryson is actually making the whole thing up from the very beginning. There are certain details you just can't imagine anyone going through, but then you look again and realize its plausible. In this book, you'll learn about Bryson's adventures with a &quot;Breakfast Pizza,&quot; his shocking discovery of a few numbers on a dental floss container, the attempt to put up Christmas decorations (with guidance from Mrs. Bryson), and questions he asks that baffle him as well. (Why do they put the capacity weight limit on the inside of elevators where it's too late to do anything about it?) In short, brilliant piece of work. I part from you with a bit of advice, if you read this in a hotel room and it's late, a pillow muffles shouts of laughter perfectly.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|The first half of this movie was so boring I almost turned off the DVD. There is a scene at the beginning where everybody is dancing in slow motion and that seems to go on for hours! The action scene at the beginning is done in slow motion and that goes on and on and isn't exciting at all. It's just boring. I hate all this slow motion stuff! Maybe it worked the first few times they did it but now it's just annoying. The freeway scene was hardly impressive. You could see where they would use the same stretch of freeway over and over. The part where Neo fights the hundreds of Agent Smiths is SO boring! Nobody gets hurt, nobody gets tired, nobody dies. So what's the point? Finally Neo just flies away. Why didn't he do that at the beginning? SO much wasted time! And the story is even more confusing. Whenever somebody starts talking that's all they do. Talk talk talk. After awhile all you hear is &quot;blah blah blah&quot; and you're looking forward to another pointless action scene. And the dialog is so dry. There's no emotion. This movie is just bad. I'll give it 2 stars for the special effects.
B00004VW0V|5.0|A critic who fails to acknowledge the power and talent of this artist because the work didn't fit the &quot;3-1/2 minute&quot; rule missed the point, embarrasses himself and does a dis-service to his craft.  Here is an artist that was driven from the industry TWICE by the greed of an uncaring industry.  This record is a collection of works that represented a fresh new direction for Cat Stevens.  It's what those who appreciate his work looked forward to hearing from him.  Cat Stevens could be trusted to change direction because he established his writing credentials early.  This entire record spills forth emotion and meaning that we find hard to get close to on our own.<BR>Although the Suite is a very unique offering it represents a complete expression of the thoughts and feelings that give the piece its character and significance.  Not a half baked chopped down 3-1/2 minutes that would better suit most &quot;critics.&quot;  Cat Stevens session work was meticulous in every detail.  He spent hours pouring over tracks to get them right.  The time spent on arrangements and attention to detail is well known in the industry by those who worked with him at A&amp;M and at Crystal Studios etc etc.  By the time this record was released, Cat Stevens had gone through the &quot;mill&quot; and had polished his performance such that the reproduction of his recordings in a live setting was amazing.  Buy the record.  It documents the efforts of an accomplished artist as he reaches about himself and produces a product that is his alone and well worth the investment of ownership, not to mention respect. I believe that Cat Stevens wrote this record for himself - a kind of splurge.  It contains the essence of his art and is very much a part of what he was about in 1973.  Too bad we pushed him out of the business - our loss.
B0000AOV85|5.0|At first when I heard this DVD was just a show that aired on VH1, I was skeptical. After going through the bonus material even before watching the actual program, though, I knew I was in for a real treat. The history of the band is breifly discussed to show where creatively the four members, sans Syd, were at during this transitional period. From there, very in-depth interviews and note-for-note explanations for each song are given. Ever wanted to know who the choir heard in &quot;Time&quot; was, or maybe the incredible female singer in &quot; The Great Gig In the Sky&quot;? The rambling old man heard throughout the album, perhaps? Take a look. I, myself was always partial to &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Us and Them&quot;, two songs the DVD goes into great detail over. You are also treated to a super-smooth demonstration of David Gilmour's godlike guitar-playing prowess on both electric and acoustic! There are even demo reels of a bluesier version of &quot;Money&quot; and a somewhat more sullen version of &quot;Time&quot; revealed. Beautiful! Amazing music from an equally amazing band.
B0000AZJXQ|2.0|Dont get me wrong i love maynard and what he's doing with TooL but as i listened to the album i could only point out a few songs that caught my attention. im a musician, and i know all the members of the band are very talented but what was produced on this album was not expected, if you're a diehard APC fan or crazy about maynard buy the album, but coming from a song writers point of view they gave it a shot and we can at least give them that. i still belive maynard is still one of the greatest vocalist of all time. i titled this review &quot;understandable&quot; because it is. maynard is frontman for two unique bands and it is hard enough being an important part of both of them.
B000060P79|5.0|Wow! This CD rocks! You don't have to like punk to like this CD. I heard their song on the radio, I'd Do Anything, and I loved it. So I thought I should check this band out.

Not only are there 13 tracks, there are great tracks with funny and cool lyrics that will blow you away. Candian bands rock! Buy it today! ~*Rock on!*~
0316666343|4.0|This book pulled me in from the very start.  Sebold does a wonderful job of breaking away the shell that is Suzie Salmon.  She takes you deep into her soul and the heart of her family.  I felt every emotion that Suzie did. The only fault of this book is the false hope that people can come back from the dead to fulfill fantasies.  It was a beautiful moment in the book, but it was incredibly sad because its not real.  We only get one chance at this life.  Its unsettling to think that passed souls just sit and watch over family, while craving to be part of the world again.  Everyone glamorizes death into saying that heaven is perfect.  This book makes you think twice about why heaven might be.  I commend Sebold and recommend this book to anyone with compassion.  This a book where you must let go of preconcieved notions and just take in the words for what they are.
0446530891|3.0|In David Baldacci's new thriller, &quot;Split Second,&quot; Sean King and Michelle Maxwell are Secret Service agents who failed in their jobs to protect the presidential candidates entrusted to their care.  After he was drummed out of the Service, King started a new life in rural Virginia as a country lawyer and volunteer deputy. Maxwell is placed on administrative leave, and she decides to do some sleuthing of her own.  Soon, she begins to believe that her case and King's may be connected somehow.  Maxwell and King join forces to get to the bottom of the events that wrecked their careers.<br />Baldacci has stumbled badly with this novel.  The setup is intriguing enough.  Maxwell and King are two attractive and capable individuals who gain the reader's sympathy immediately.  However, before long, the plot slowly but surely unravels.  The novel ends up preposterously, and even the most gullible reader is forced to groan at the convoluted and irrational events that explain Maxwell's and King's downfall.<br />No one expects thrillers to be models of logic.  However, one would expect that a writer of Baldacci's stature would have enough respect for his loyal readership to come up with a story line that has some basis in reality.  In addition, at four hundred pages, &quot;Split Second&quot; is too long and lumbering. As appealing as the main characters are, they cannot make up for the unbelievable and far-fetched narrative that left me shaking my head in disbelief.
B00005JY1B|5.0|This movie was excellent!  It's the kind of movie that you want to purchase and watch over and over and it just sticks in your mind after seeing it.  Very touching and thought provoking movie!  I highly recommend this film!  Funny, quirky and down-right moving!

B00008EY9G|5.0|Through the years, we have had some really unique, well-done and chilling movies that have become classics in this genre:  &quot;Psycho,&quot; &quot;The List of Adrian Messenger,&quot; &quot;Ten Little Indians,&quot; &quot;Frailty&quot; and now this wonderfully constructed mystery that combines elements of all of these and more, and yet manages to come off as quite a unique shocker in its own manipulative way.  Take your stock ten characters, place them in a motel (hmm???), an awful storm and then before you know, one by one....yes, they're picked off.  But note some of the eerie clues director Mangold posits:  why does the room number on room 6 becoming 9 important: what's that on Ray Liotta's shirt?  What are the scenes with Alfred Molina all about; nothing is as it seems in this movie and that's what makes it so much fun.  John Cusack is brilliant in his role as the cop turned chauffeur; Rebecca De Mornay does for this role what Janet Leigh did for &quot;Psycho&quot; and Angie Dickinson for &quot;Dressed to Kill.&quot;  Ray Liotta is also effective in his law enforcing role; Amanda Peet is both beautiful and impressive as the hooker going to start her own lime/orange farm.  Little Bret Roehr as Timmy is also eerily effective.  Only John McGinley who takes George a little over the top seems out of place and that's not a drawback, just one of those little petty things we have to complain about?<br />I loved the feel of this movie; the rain, the general &quot;staginess&quot; of the motel itself; De Mornay's love affair with her cell phone.<br />This is a great movie and in time think it will join those underappreciated classic mysteries of our time.<br />ENJOY!
B00000JY1X|4.0|It seems that most of the reviews here take this album entirely too seriously - breathlessly praising the brilliance of the lyrics, and how affecting they were..<BR>In my mind, the most impressive aspect here is not the &quot;brilliance&quot; of Merritt's song-writing, but the sheer simplicity of it. Despite what some of the music snobs may want you to think, no lyrical reference here is so complicated that it will, as one reviewer wrote, leave you heading for a dictionary. The subject matter isn't complex either - 69 Love songs? Aren't 95% of pop songs about love anyway?<BR>These songs are consistently funny. I can't listen to the chorus of &quot;Papa was Rodeo&quot; or the verses of &quot;Acoustic Guitar&quot; without laughing. Merritt's true talent lies in his ability to write a humorous song while instilling it with genuine feeling - despite it's humor, acoustic guitar is a song about a woman who's only really method of connecting with her daughter was to play her songs on a guitar, which, it turns out, wasn't enough.<BR>The music here is not complicated either - in fact, it's all fairly derivative - which is the point. Merritt has made an album that's like a juke box - you've heard all these genres before, just maybe not on the same album. But all the songs have one thing in common - they're catch pop songs, nothing more, nothing less.<BR>All this isn't to say that everything here is good - there are 69 songs, some are bound to be bad (Punk Love, for instance, is three minutes of my life I'll sadly never have back).<BR>But over all, don't be initimidated by the reviews that breathlessly congratulate the Magnetic Fields on the &quot;brilliance&quot; of their album - it's merely very simple, and very good.
B00005JK8K|5.0|I have to say, this movie really is absolutely great!  The battle scenes, the emotions, the characters, they all tie in together extremely well!  This movie really displays a realistic perspective of war.  What else can I say?  If you have seen Face/Off and Mission: Impossible 2, you should definitely see this movie!<br />For those of you who hate Windtalkers, you're nuts!!  This movie is awesome and thrilling in every aspect!  Some people may erroneously think that Windtalkers should have been about the importance of the Navajo code and how it helped the U.S. achieve victory in major Pacific battles, why is probably why they may not like the movie as much.  Windtalkers isn't necessarily about the Navajo code, it's more or less about the importance of friendship and the immorality of war.<br />Some people may say that Windtalkers doesn't have a plot, that it's just fighting and talking.  You don't see the plot in the movie, because it's not about one or more people trying to accomplish a certain physical task (like Tears of the Sun or Saving Private Ryan).  It is more related to inner conflict.  The plot, instead, is how Joe Enders (Nicolas Cage's character) tries to cope with his new assignment as guarding Navajo codetalker Ben Yahzee (Adam Beach's character) and killing him if Yahzee is about to be captured.  At first, Enders tries to stay apart from Yahzee to avoid being friends, but as time passes by, he finds himself drawing closer and closer to Yahzee and eventually befriends him.  Enders ultimately sees Yahzee's true character and finds himself unable to kill him if capture is imminent.  Enders would, instead, decide to save his life.  All other events in the movie, including the beginning where Enders loses all of his men, influence Ender's conflicting thoughts and emotions.<br />I won't spoil the ending for you if you haven't seen it yet, but you will be emotionally drawn to the movie when you see it.
B000005JA8|5.0|if you don't like it why not just say so.  solipsism is what you reject yet your words smack of it.  why not listen again and hear it for what it is - not what you think it should or could be.  one must be an artist to truly comprehend art.
B00005JL3A|1.0|I love the Resident Evil video games. I have been a fan since the first one was released in 1996. I love the storyline, the erie soundtrack, the creepy sound effects and of course, blowing the heads off of the walking dead. When I heard they were making a film based on it with George Romero directing, I went unconscious. I was so excited and couldn't wait to see it. Then, Mr. Romero was dropped from the project and it was given to the biggest hack in Hollywood history...Paul W.S. Anderson. Besides the competent Mortal Kombat, he has yet to make a film worthy of a one week run at a dollar house. This movie was shameful from beginning to end. Complete with faux-Matrix action, cookie-cutter acting, void of any horror or suspence and featuring CG that must have been made on a Tandy PC from 1988. He even trashed the storyline. There was no Red Queen nonsense in any of the games, and certainly no child hologram telling everyone they are going to die. And don't give me the excuse of it being campy on purpose. This movie failed on every possible level, including being one of those bad movies that never takes itself seriously and becoming a midnite cable classic. Anyone who likes this movie needs to see a George Romero film immediately. He is the one who started the whole zombie genre and it still the best at it. Once you see any of those films, you'll forgot about this one and realize how much better this could have been. Mr. Anderson is also helming the Alien Vs. Predator movie, due out Summer 2004. This movie has been in the works as long as the recent Freddy Vs Jason film. You'd be better off playing the 16 bit Sega game than being subjected to his desecration of it as a film. He is sure proof that talent and vision are traits not needed for a director's job in Hollywood.
B0000AUHOH|2.0|After Leonard Nimoy scored hits directing Star Trek III &amp; IV, William Shatner stepped behind the helm for this fifth installment, which is undeniably the worst in the motion picture series. Here we find Captain Kirk, Spock, and McCoy at odds against a renegade vulcan (and Spock's never before mentioned half brother) named Sybok who is searching for God. While this may sound like an intriguing idea, it certainly isn't presented as well as it should have been thanks to the derivative story, flat direction, and poor special effects. The only redeeming qualities about Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, is the beginning scene with Kirk, Spock, and McCoy at Mt. Yosimetee (Sp.?); this scene is very comedic and perfectly displays the acting chemistry between the three.  The film has recently been re-released as one of Paramount's Special Edition 2-Disc Star Trek DVD's and includes the usual type of extras that can be found on the other Special Edition DVD's, including test and production footage from the justifiably aborted &quot;Rockman&quot; scenes.  All in all, this film is worth a look for Trekkies, especially with the new extras, but the only real positive thing I can say about this package is that a Special Edition re-release of the excellent Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country will soon be on the horizon.
B00005S6K8|2.0|This is only my second online movie review--I felt quite compelled to speak out upon seeing a cable broadcast of this film. First off, let me say that I LOVE Harrison Ford and Julia Ormond, and really like Greg Kinnear. I really, *really* wish I could like this movie, but I find it so incredibly pointless ande lame as a remake! That is, if you've seen the original version with Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart, and William Holden. No question--it's a noble effort, but I'm sorry--there is simply NO COMPARISON as to how superior this story is interpreted in the original. Why try to re-make perfection?<br />I'm very bummed out seeing these three excellent actors trying to recreate--or, re-realize--what is so classically timeless and charming and something that so belongs to three other actors that can never be matched! Julia Ormond is so beautiful in her own right, and she won my eternal admiration as a contemporary screen icon for her performance in \\"Smilla's Sense of Snow,\\" but she cannot--and should not try to--compare with Hepburn. Ditto for Ford in his recreation of the Bogart role. I say, let all three of these contemporary actors become/remain screen icons in their own right/time, but there is no way they can compete with the screen icons of that other time via this movie. Furthermore, Audrey could not replace Julia in \\"Smilla,\\" nor could Bogie replace Harrison in the numerous roles Ford has made classic and memorable. The updated scenarios/references in this remake are, for the most part, trivial and empty. Please, go buy/rent the original 1954 version of this film. It is simply NOT TO BE MISSED! There is a magic in it that you just won't find in this re-make, and I'm sorry (for these actors) to have to say it.
0385484518|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie was a wonderful book about life.  Often times we just go through the daily routine of our lives, never looking into our feelings and the reasons for why we do things.  Morrie, did a great job of putting this into perspective.  He gave a new meaning to life besides the hustle and bustle we are used to.  His new meaning of life, odd enough, came from the idea of death.  <BR> Morrie has developed a disease that is deadly.  He's life is coming down to just a few months.  He wants to take these last few months and share his new outlook on life with everyone else.  <BR> I highly recommend this book.  It's a quick, easy read, so you don't have to worry about it taking to much time out of your daily routine.  So that's not an excuse.  Besides it wouldn't hurt to see life from a new perspective.  Reading this book gives you an inside of thoughts that enter your mind when you know life won't be lasting much longer.
B00006HAZG|5.0|The BBC adaptation of David Copperfield is nothing short of excellent.  The one thing that makes it so terriffic is the role of young David played by Daniel Radcliffe.  Daniel is more recognized as the beloved wizard Harry Potter.  This movie was a wonderful start to his career.  The movie also has some great names sharing the credits including Maggie Smith, Bob Hoskins and Zoe Wanamaker.  If you want to see a movie with Britan's finest in action, see David Copperfield.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|It is an absolute blast of hilarity when I go to Amazon.com and see all the negative reviews of this film. People (mostly really, really sutpid, stupid people)have already assumed the whole thing and are dissing this film like it is the end of The Matrix saga ,BUT OH NO NO NO YOU ARE SO WRONG! . I must first say that this film is the second part of a THREE PART series so now that you remember that you can kick yourself in the ass and call yourself a big idiot. Everything in RELOADED is 'middled' if I can say that. I mean 'middled' because it is truly a middle piece of story from a whole on and becuase it is just that the result is disasterous to people with a one track mind. You must wait for REVOLUTIONS to be released to see the whole result and then and only then it will be a day of truth for all these assuming bafoons.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|This was a horrible follow up to a good movie.<br />There was barely a script to this movie!<br />This movie was filled with cool fight scenes, but they lasted way too long and were over done to be entertaining. There was a techno dance scene that was put into the movie that made no sense at all and wasted about 15 minutes of my life. It looked like a bunch of mind controlled zombies if you asked me. There was nothing mystical or mind boggling about this movie at all except when the movie ended with TO BE CONTINUED IN THE MIDDLE OF A SCENE! We all got so angry over the way it ended we vowed to not even bother buying The Matrix 3. It was really disappointing.<br />At least with other trillogies, you know it is going to be a trillogy, so you expect that. Don't waste your money until 3 comes out on DVD..buy the boxed set!
B00004ZD69|3.0|Superlatives are a bit strong. The form of the extended tracks is episodic, and the harmonic and melodic material is entirely modal, grounded in unremarkable ostinato drones. Much of the music is spent building up to climaxes in which the band falls into a groove that is largely the same from one song to the next.<br />Those aren't necessarily flaws, if you happen to like the groove and the small set of modal figures the band repeatedly employs. I do, and I especially enjoy the ambient sections, which feature some very nicely constructed timbres. But there's nothing really new in any of this, so listeners hungry for quirky, genre-busting music should ignore the hype and keep looking.
0062502182|5.0|I think the cynics can't fail to enjoy this book if they let their over-rated critical faculties be tempered even slightly by their sense of intuition which, contrary to ideas prevalent in the modern age, is one that actually exists.   <br />I believe in the central message entirely: that we create our own future, we literally do, according to the manner in which we go through life and how closely we abide by our inner voice. There's a line in the book about the universe conspiring to help us achieve the something we want. That should be qualified. It's not anything. It's the same thing for everyone isn't it .. enlightenment.   <br />The book's spiritual message rang true for me as I have thought independently: every step I take towards enlightenment counts as three because God, this unmistakeable force, appreciates the one step effort I make and contributes two of its own - my destiny approaches me as I approach my destiny, it reaches out to me and carries me along. <br />And that is why I think the book is so popular. It's not, as the critics imply, because the readership is simple or stupid or incapable of being 'discerning' or of deconstructing the text. It's because Coehlo is in tune with this universal song, as they are, and they recognise this parable speaking straight to their hearts, revealing truths they already know, have already experienced - yes, empirically, if you must know - right down in their breast. Or else it will strike a chord in the seekers. <br />Those out of step with the song, on the other hand, will think it a fraud. 'A story contrived to appeal to this docile mass with its fuzzy New Age ideas, pah!' What they usually fail to realise is that the experience of God and of our own godliness is exactly that - not an idea, but an experience as real as getting brown in the sun. Once you've experienced it - or rather, you've recognised that you're experiencing it (for everyone does) - you've awoken and life is never the same. If you doubt it, just try it - follow the guiding principle evinced here, genuinely do, and a year later report back to the rationalist in you. By then I wager you'll be recommending this book to all your friends.
B000089RVX|5.0|Before I bought this album, I have never heard anything like this type of music. I enjoy rock, but there was something definitely unique about this group. After hearing the first single &quot;Bring Me to Life,&quot; I knew I had to buy the CD. The vocals are pleasantly haunting and add to the depth of each song. The lyrics alone are truly poetic and speak of love, loss, hate...and every deep emotion one could ever experience. I love and enjoy every song on the album, but my favorites include the second single, &quot;Going Under,&quot; &quot;Last Breath,&quot; and &quot;Whisper.&quot; I kind of wish &quot;Farther Away&quot; was placed on the US album as well, but it is found on an import. I would invite those who have a deep appreciation for lyrics and emotion to purchase this album. If you just want the album to be &quot;cool&quot; or say you own it...don't bother. This is one of the best albums I own to date. Thank You Evanescence!!!
B000089RVR|3.0|Dido sold her soul.  I get the feeling when listening to this CD, that Dido is trying to be something she isn't...trying to be somebody else.  No Angel was much more interesting to listen to.  The songs in &quot;Life&quot; are boring and Dido cannot hold a note.  She must have needed the money to do this one.  I wish I had mine back.
B0000524CY|5.0|Ok I loved this movie. I had to read The Novel as a child because my parents wouldn't let me see Excorcist but the Omen was ok? Yeah that's weird but it's true. I can go on with the story about the book but I'm not going to, except it was one of the best. now I just baught the dvd today, and I was excited. Now I've seen this movie in the theater. so instead I watched the directors comentary. now if you are not a film buff and don't want to hear someone talk shop. I suggest You never watch the directors comentary. but in this case, since I am a video artist and I love film. I study and find any info I can about any given film I find a serious Fancy too. With director comentaries, I feel they are a great source of Information. because you get to hear actors and directors react to each other and learn things about the film. you get the idea.<br />Well I loved hearing about Friedkin talking about filming in Iraq. I found it insightful and in my eyes very &quot;NERD FULLFILLING&quot; But as I watched the Comentary I realized what a  dullard he really is. I mean the whole thing was Him speaking. You got very little insights on the movie making process. no interactions between film maker writer producers or actors.<br />Just as you would In most DVDs. The best one is Texas chainsaw massacre which I saw on the IFC. that gave you a whole lot more to offer. You got a since of the struggle to get the damn thing done. But with Freidkin You got a since of his vision and not Blatty's. No interview of Linda Blair or Max von Sydow. these people ar all living, so there was no problem in getting these actors imput or memories but Instead You basically Friedkin  talking over the movie, and simply providing naration, which is quite annoying in my opinion. I like Friedkins work. but that was a bit much.<br />I realized if given the chance, I might want to pass up working with Friedkin He seems so self absorbed that It would be like working with an ego maniac who can't do it again. it would be like trying to build a boat with Noah, and all He talks about is the Stupid Ark. or flying in a Jet plane with the Wright Brothers. Talk about Bragards!, and lets not forget about me trying to put a bullet in my head.<br />Thats the since I get after hearing Friedkin. this is a man who created something so profound. Inspired so many people by scaring the BEJESUS out of them, and yet believes his own hype. Despite his prolific career. he has yet to make something as Good as  the Excorcist. In fact most are forgettable or not worth watching.<br />He kind of reminds me if Geraldo Rivera had any actual Talent. Now think about what I just said.would be like trying to build a boat with Noah, and all He talks about is the Stupid Ark. or flying in a Jet plane with the Wright Brothers. Talk about Bragards!, and lets not forget about me trying to put a bullet in my head.<br />Thats the since I get after hearing Friedkin. this is a man who created something so profound.

B000063S6Z|1.0|All you folks who expect a moving trance beat will be sorely disppointed. I wanted to scream &quot;get on with it!&quot; It doesn't. However if you're wanting music to which to contemplate your navel, then go with this. It is guaranteed to put you to sleep. A real sorry purchase.
B000067JG3|5.0|Oh my goodness.  I cannot, I repeat, cannot believe that people hate this movie.  I really can't.  I saw it, I watched it forty more times, and I STILL LOVE IT.  People say it's corny and has no content.  NO CONTENT??!!!  Please.  Look a little deeper.  This film is all about family and morals and values.  How much more content do you want?  You have no idea how many values and morals I have picked up from this movie.  Not to mention the fact that &quot;My Favorite Things&quot; has yet to fail in making me feel better.  How can you say this is corny?  It's a beautiful film.  The scenery, the MUSIC, the content, it's all beautiful (especially the music).  To quote Shirley Jones: &quot;The musicals had a good, happy feeling, saying that the world is a better place.  They say it's not reality, but who cares? There's too much reality these days.&quot; So true.  The storyline is so beautiful.  Maybe it's not perfectly real, but it really can cheer you up.  Maybe if we were all like the von Trapp family, this world would be a much better place.  Oh, and if you think this story has no content, I suggest you read Maria von Trapp's autobiography about her and her family.  That should give some insight into just how wonderful her family was, and the values and morals this film gives to us.  Not to mention the acting in this film.  Christopher Plummer captures the essence of a strict, retired sea captain perfectly.  And Julie Andrews.  Her voice is absolutely beautiful and never fails.  And her presence as Maria is wonderful.  She has the humor, the voice, the happiness, she just fits the role perfectly.  Just please, look a little deeper before you criticize this film as having no content. Please.  It's absolutely wonderful and mesmorizing if you look properly.
B00006BTCA|5.0|One of those albums which bear listening on repeat for months. And you'll wonder what you listened to before Turn on the Bright Lights came into your life.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|I just saw the &quot;Matrix Reloaded,&quot; and I have to say, guns will always beat martial arts, and I don't care how good you are with your footwork.  In Star Trek, they invented a sniper rifle which was actually just a transporter device that could teleport a bullet into a selected target, which would definitely create a paradigm shift in military thinking today.  On top of that, a device like a transporter would cause a new type of military<BR>standoff.  Why?  Because with current medical technology, you could teleport a small bit of poison into a victim and cause that person to die of seemingly &quot;natural causes.&quot;  I have no doubt the military would try to do something like this, as the Russian KG B has already done something like this, only they used needles to deliver the poison, bumping into their<BR>victims and pretending that the injection was a poke from an umbrella or something.  If everyone had the ability to transport poison into every other leader, they wouldn't have an outright war, but a standoff, as kings have not led their own battles since the days of Ramayana, a true warrior's kind of story.  Until people start portraying battles like the armies of<BR>Ramayana, we're in for more movies like the Matrix Reloaded.  That's just how I feel.
B0000C7PRY|5.0|I have been a Spock's Beard fan since 1996, I have loved every one of their CD's and can listen to them over and over again. I was very upset when Neal left the Beard. The last Spock's Beard concert I had gone to, I had said, &quot;There is no music, just Spock's Beard&quot;. Little did I know that that was their last performance together as a complete band with Neal leading. So now where was I gonna get my fix.<br />Well I only have to look as far as Testimony. I think this is Neal's greatest creation to date, the amount of talent he has in his one pinky, goes far beyond this guitar player here. There can only be one explaination, it must be god's work.<br />I am not a religious person. I am Jewish, and grew up without any religion. I can overlook the religious content in this CD, and feel the passionate music, read the words that touch my heart. Wait that's some Rush lyrics. Sorry. Back to the review.<br />So what was I saying, Oh yeah. Being not religious, I still felt like I would cry listening to this CD. It is so amazing, that I cannot even come up with the right words to describe how much I love this CD.
B00009V7T2|5.0|The second band to rise from the ashes of At The Drive-In, the Mars Volta was formed by Cedric Bixler (vocals) and Omar Rodriguez-Lopez (guitars) in 2001, months after At The Drive In's breakup. The Mars Volta focuses on ATDI's experimental side, by adding hits of progressive rock, free jazz and Latin music to the aggressive blend of emo and punk. Bixler and Rodriguez-Lopez are joined by Ikey Owens, Jeremy Michael Ward (who died of an overdose a month before the album's release), and John Theodore. Flea and John Frusciante of the Red Hot Chili Peppers also collaborate on the album. <br />De-loused in the Comatorium was inspired by the life of Julio Venegas, a childhood friend of some of the members in the band. Venegas, an artist in the El Paso region, slipped into a coma for a week after a drug overdose, and experienced a series of dreams, and battles between the good and bad aspects of the human conscience. He emerged from the coma in the end, but ultimately decided to take his own life. De-loused in the Comatorium narrates the internal struggle of Venegas, his addiction, his fearlessness and his thoughts while comatose until his life came to self-inflicted end. Yet the lyrics are very abstract, which probably represent the psychological and subconscious battle. Yet abstractions have been constant with Cedric Bixler ever since his days fronting At The Drive-In.<br />Musically, however, Comatorium is eclectic, bizarre, bewildering, and mesmerizing. Comparisons to art rock legends Rush are frequent, yet this is a lot more intense and complex than anything ever put out by Rush. Yes, Bixler's vocals are high-pitched, like Rush frontman/bassist Geddy Lee's, yet they are a lot more hostile and urgent. The guitars aren't also as carefully composed as those of Rush, and the drumming isn't nearly as multifaceted or virtuosic. However, the songs on Comatorium are long, sprawling and interesting, usually going through several phases before its conclusion. This is a throwbackto progressive rock. It is indulgent, ambitious and bombastic, much like prog-rock bands that have come and gone in the past, but yet The Mars Volta always keeps the music exciting. They also have a sense of direction on where the music needs to go, something a band like Rush was very good, at as opposed to past albums by Yes or Dream Theater, which insisted on the band members aimlessly noodling or overexploiting their musical talents. The band members started out playing in bands where raw emotion was the fundamental constituent of the songs they created, and did not rely on classically trained instrumentation. In fact, most of this album sounds like ATDI with longer songs with elements of old Santana, Pink Floyd's Meddle and Miles Davis circa 1969.<br />De-loused in a Comatorium is not an album; it's an encounter. It reflects a tragedy so musically and so abrasively. It is not mainstream in the slightest, so don't expect a 12-minute jamfest like \\"Cicatriz ESP,\\" or even a short 4 minute song like \\"Inertiatic ESP\\" to come on the radio anytime soon. It's full of enigmas, questions, emotions and reflections. Whether the Mars Volta is your style of music or not, De-loused in the Comatorium is probably the most interesting and uncompromising album released this year.

B00000DCHI|5.0|This Greatest Hits CD is great. When it first came out on tape, I could listen to the entire tape and there was not a song that I didn't like. When the CD came out and I bought that, though, it wsan't quite as good. On the CD it has the original recording of \\"Say Goodbye to Hollywood,\\" but on the tape it has the \\"live\\" version, which is much better. The tape also has a version of \\"New York State of Mind\\" which is much better than the one on the CD because it is dominated by Joel's lyrics and piano instead of the CD version which has a crazy sax player who plays a tune that does not go with the rest of the song. The CD has some really subpar songs such as \\"The Entertainer,\\" \\"Captain Jack,\\" and \\"She's got a Way.\\" There is one good song that isn't on the tape and that is \\"Scenes from an Italian Restaurant.\\" Unfortunately, I can't find the tape version anywhere, on tape now or on CD. (The tapes now have the CD version.)Highlights on this CD include \\"Movin' Out,\\" \\"Allentown,\\" \\"Only the Good Die Young,\\" and \\"While the Night is Still Young.\\" If you can find the tape, you have to buy it, but until you find it, this is your best bet.
B00000K413|5.0|Hi, I am from India. <BR>Words fail to clearly express the sheer beauty and impact of the album, \\"The Hurting\\". This album is a must for anyone who really loves music with a lot of substance and adventure. TEARS FOR FEARS is my all-time favourite band. Also, I personally feel, in many respects, TEARS FOR FEARS is the only perfect band in the whole world. If you don't believe me, just listen to this debut album of TEARS FOR FEARS. <br /> Each and every track is a classic in its own way. Here is my review of each and every track:<br />1) The Hurting: Title track that gives a glimpse of how thoughtful this band actually is. This one track should prove that Curt Smith and Roland Orzabal are people with genuine insight and that by no means are they negative. How about lines such as: <BR>&quot;Get in line with the things you know.<BR>Feel the pain, feel the sorrow<BR>Touch the hurt and don't let go, don't let go<BR>Get in line with the things you know<BR>Lean to cry like a baby<BR>Then the hurting won't come back, they won't come back, won't come back&quot;<br />The echoing guitars perfectly fit the mood and are a treat for the ears. Both Curt and Roland sing this song.<br />2) Mad World: Moody and reflective song. The song is not negative. It is about the current situation of people living their lives without any morals or values. It is a call for doing something to improve the terrible situation. The song sounds very much relevant and fresh to this day. <br />3) Pale Shelter: The song is about the lack of love in the lives of children due to inaccessible parents. Fine blend of acoustics and electronics. The Spanish guitar strumming is amazing!<br />4) Ideas as Opiates: This song is as good as its title. Slightly difficult to understand when I heard for the first time. From what I perceive, it is about those people who mislead the general public with their opinions and who don't actually care about the good-will of the society. The saxophone work is incredible.<br />5) Memories Fade: Totally blown off when I heard it for the first time. Incredible keyboard, guitar and saxophone arrangements. You can sense the actual mood from Roland's singing and the lively instrumentation.<br />6) Suffer the Children: The first song recorded and released by TEARS FOR FEARS. Like Pale Shelter, a very thoughtful song about children who don't get proper attention and love during their growing years. Nice pop song.<br />7) Watch Me Bleed: According to me, the second most philosophical track of the album. Once again, the song is not negative. Great pop-rock. Wonderful and sensible keyboard/guitar arrangement.<br />8) Change: Brilliant xylophone playing which goes round and round. Very good song!<br />9) The Prisoner: The most philosophical song of the entire album. The hammering gothic music perfectly fits the mood. The disturbing sound is a must for this track. It is worth contemplating about this track. How about lines such as:<BR>\\"Here behind the wall<BR>I feel so small<BR>Feeling and not believing<BR>Here anger is me<BR>Love sets me free<BR>Waiting but not relating\\"<br />These are the lines that speak of most of us humans, right? We have so many negative tendencies within us because of which we feel we are in a prison and that we are not really free. Once we realise that, we can try to free ourselves. The song is about all that.<br />10) Start of the Breakdown: The keyboard and percussion arrangements are simply brilliant because the song perfectly gives rise to the actual feeling of a breakdown situation.<br />11) The Way You Are: A non-album track, which appears on the remastered CD. Very unusual and up-tempo track. Very odd percussion arrangement, it actually reminds me of a percussion instrument called &quot;Chenda&quot;. Artists associated with temples or Kathakali in Kerala, South India, play chendas. <br />There are also lovely re-mixed versions of &quot;Pale Shelter&quot;, &quot;Mad World&quot; and &quot;Change&quot;.<br />That's all, folks. Above all, just as the name suggests, TEARS FOR FEARS is a band with a positive attitude. Their music really cannot be categorised. Most of their records are genuinely good, timeless and relevant. Buy this album, enjoy and feel every moment.
B00008H2LB|3.0|You have the admire the effort that Linkin Park puts into their albums. Yes, Meteora does sound overly produced, one can say the vocals are timed too accurately, there is nothing raw about linkin park. Their lyrics are solid, they flow well and at time sound flawless with the melody. If you are looking for meaning in the lyrics, look else where, Linkin Park's meteora is targeted for 13-16 year olds. Besides all that, this album is enjoyable. You can listen to it from start to finish..when I first got it, I listened to it time after time. The best tracks are: Dont Stay, Somewhere I belong, Faint, From the inside, Session and Numb...As you can see there are plenty of great songs on this album...if you like radio-friendly music and like Hybrid Theory I would recomend you pick this album up.
B000002UUX|5.0|Yes, that's right i believe this is the best thrash album; it's a better cd than Slayer's &quot;Reign in Blood,&quot; Anthrax's &quot;Among the Living,&quot; and yes even better than the legendary &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; by Dave's former band metallica. This album is the first to feature Marty Friedman, who is probably the best soloist in metal music. Friedman's phrasing is so out of control that no one can ever really cover his solos. &quot;Holy Wars...The punishment Due&quot; kicks off the album with a vintage ripping mustaine intensity, this song could be considered megadeth's best song ever. In this song dave successfully merges his musical superiority  with some of the best lyrics ever (trust me - read the booklet). Hangar eighteen might be the best musical song megadeth has ever done. Basically the solos on this album are absolutely mind blowing and so technical. Whether you're a guitar player or a thrash fan you must have this album
B00008H2LE|5.0|i love linkin park(especailly mike :P).this cd is totally perfect for parties and just for listenin to.its totally like exciting.i can sit here and listen over and over and over. my top 3 songs on this cd would be....<BR>1.NUMB!<BR>2.Faint<BR>3.Breaking the Habit...<BR>actually.no.i cant choose. theyre all sooooo new and interesting.the lyrics are really something i can relate to.i think thats why i love them so much(that and mike :P).
B000002B7S|3.0|This album is the first ozzy album not to feature the legendary Randy Rhoads; Jake e. lee replaces Rhoads and, in my opinion, does a pretty good job - he definitely has the talent, but simply does not have the amazing songwriting chemistry with ozzy that Randy did. This album is definitely no &quot;Blizzard of ozz&quot; or &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot; but it does have some good tracks. The presence of cheesy ass keyboard licks on several of the tracks is the downfall of this album
0385504209|1.0|On the plus side, the book started out interesting.  In an Indiana Jones style, I was pulled into the interesting puzzles the characters had to solve under great time constraints.  Then, the book transformed into a platform for the author to rage an attack against Christianity which seemed unfounded and insulting to my personal beliefs.  Finally, I got the impression that the author had to 'finish' up.  The ending was confusing and unsatisfying.  Characters actions were no longer believable.  Finally, the evidence regarding the lie of christianity that was to be reveled at the 'end' of the quest was never shown.  This left me feeling cheated.  I can't believe people actually thought this book was good.  I feel ripped off that I bought it and actually spent time reading this trash.
B00005JKG7|5.0|I just watched this DVD tonight for the first time and I thought it was great.  Classic ghostly tale, amazing score, and fantastic camera shots.  For anyone who wants a good chilling movie this is it.
B00004BZ0N|4.0|No album is ever perfect.....so thus the 4 stars, but its anything but a bad album. <br />Ok First of all this guy says that, &quot;This is one of those records that only a crusty ol' baby boomer would love. The Clash fancies itself as a &quot;punk&quot; band. Hmmm, is that right? Well, the Cranky Reviewer thinks differently. Sure, it's loud, but it's far from good. Even Avril Lavigne is better than these jokers.&quot;<br />Im going to have to disagree, how can you do that to the clash a band that has earned itself the honor of being inducted to the Hall of Fame...Im sorry but im all of seventeen years old and i love the clash, and once again your wrong because the clash are punk they dont fancy themselves on it because they were it.....and calling Avril better is just plain stupidity...<br />But its an awesome album pick all there cds up there well worth it
B00005JLYW|4.0|Sometimes going into a movie with REALLY lowered expectations is a good thing, and that's exactly what I did when I saw \\"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle.\\" Though the first film had its good, fun moments, it inevitably grew old and tiresome toward the end and never really solidified itself as even a \\"good bad\\" movie. \\"Full Throttle,\\" though, is somehow amazingly fun and even some kind of a good movie. Director McG takes modern pop filmmaking to its zenith with Matrix-inspired fight scenes, outlandish special effects, and (surprisingly) laugh-out-loud comedy. Not to mention a few PG-13-envelope-pushing scenes that make this an instant classic for any guy.<br />Sure, the plot of the movie is REALLY thin, if even existent, and some of the subplots test a sensible viewer's patience (one involving Barrymore's character and a Witness Protection Program is eye-rollingly ridiculous). McG knows that his movies would pretty much flop if heavy on plot, so he fills the void with fantastic action sequences and cleverly executed pop culture references that are more of a film-lover's treat than a spoof (look for nods to \\"Singin' in the Rain,\\" \\"Night of the Hunter,\\" and even TV's \\"CSI\\"). Much like first movie, though, it does have its rough spots where it sags, but they are not as numerous as \\"Full Throttle\\"'s predecessor and they are redeemed. How can one forget a drop-dead sexy Demi Moore; Cameron Diaz swimming in a martini glass or riding a mechanical bull; or the Angels grooving and writhing in a seductively bawdy, full-blown dance number?<br />That's the great thing about \\"Full Throttle.\\" It manages to coast COMPLETELY on brainless whimsy and not really insult the viewer in the process. In fact, in a way, it's kind of rewarding. \\"Full Throttle\\" has the look of a cutting-edge action spectacle, but the sensibility of a classic adventure flick. Guys may be taken by the female beauty in the film (as this reviewer was), and women may scoff at it, but even the serious filmgoer won'tbe able to keep a grin off their face. It's great fun, but don't go into this expecting a \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\"-quality picture, because \\"Raiders\\" this ain't. This review may be glowing, but it's still not hard to see the dramatic and narrative limitations of such a film. Do yourself a favor, though, and forget all of that heavy film jargon. Why beat \\"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle\\" down when it succeeds so well in being the funnest, most viscerally exciting movie of the year?
0316776963|5.0|David Sedaris is, without a doubt, my favorite humorist alive.  His writings are at once funny and poignant.  To be able to touch and move readers in the way that Sedaris does is truly a gift, and one that should be treasured while he's still around treating society to more of his wonderful work.<br />&quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; is at least as funny as &quot;Naked&quot;, and some of Sedaris's stories about living as an ignorant American in France were truly unforgettable.  A highly recommended read to take on vacation.  It's quick, absorbing and very rewarding.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I like 2 others reviews of the cd. That's what I call funny stuff.
0385504209|5.0|It shouldn't surprise anyone that this book is the subject of criticism and has had its historical accuracy and the like seriously questioned.  Those criticisms go a bit overboard, in my book.  First and foremost, this book is an intelligently written thriller, one that will constantly have the reader on turning the page waiting to see what happens next.  Dan Brown has written an ingenious series of codes that help the mystery unravel in a captivating manner.  This isn't a garden-variety whodunnit and it was never meant to be.  Rather, it's one of the few intelligent thrillers out in the market today.<br />In fact, this book has sparked an interest to learn more about art, architecture and history on my part.  Brown does a fantastic job of making each of these elements come alive in his story.  It's impossible to come away from this book without a greater appreciation for the artworks that inspired it.<br />All in all, this is a highly recommended book.  There are parts towards the end that make the final twist rather predictable, but they weren't so transparent as to make the story unenjoyable.  Solving the riddles is the true joy of this book.
B00006CXSS|5.0|A must have for anyone who enjoys historical/military films.<BR>The special features and interviews are a great addition to the series.  This movie is a respectable tribute to the men and women to took part in this world changing event.
B00008PC2O|4.0|(Instead of reviewing a film you probably already know, I stick to DVD special features)<br />Those Extras:<br />Commentary:  WHOA!  Holier-than-thou Cameron actually recorded a scene by scene talkfest with co-writer William Wisher.  We are told how much we should appreciate it due to the fact that Cameron dragged his lazy behind downstairs to record it in his private screening room.  That aside, it's a good listen that provides nice insight, to T1 as well which had this feature sorely missing.<br />Deleted Scenes:  Cameron is even watching his original near three hour cut, with some interesting moments that had to be sheared.<br />Behind the Scenes:  Much like the &quot;Superman&quot; DVD, this is one of the rare care packages that features three different explorations of the making of the film.  You will not go away wanting more.<br />Misc:  Silly features for diehards to play with on their computers, like morphing personal photos or building your own T...erminator.  For once even the box is worth a mention, a cool 3-D, shining silver cover and case.<br />Overall:  I'll get hammered for only giving four stars, but I love my outtakes and screen tests, and none are here.  But what is will dazzle.
B000099T2L|5.0|I'm a 23 year old female in Houston &amp; I sometimes feel as though I'm an outsider b/c I'm one of the FEW people in this city that does not like Beyonce. However, I can not deny that she has TRUE talent. Giving credit where credit is due she by far exceeded my expectations on this album. Since I don't like 'B'-the person, I honestly tried to find faults(i know its sad), but I couldn't. This is a very good debut. Everyone, from my sister (27yr old-housewife/mother), to my boyfriend (24 yr old educated thug), to my mother (46 yr old) to the hoodrat/chickenheads in my complex.. loved this cd! This is one of the few cds that I can listen to ALL the way through. <BR>My favorites are of course the club bangers 'Crazy In Luv' &amp; 'Baby Boy', as well as the beautiful 'Daddy' &amp; 'Closer I get to you', The &quot;In Love&quot; songs 'Dangerously in luv II' &amp; 'Thats how u like it' (w/ JayZ), The bad-girl-let-it-all-hang-out songs 'Naughty Girl' &amp; 'Hip Hop Star'. Surprisingly my Absolute favorite song on the album is 'Speechless'. I love the emotional rollercoaster that she takes you on. She chose the perfect title b/c that song left me ... Speechless. Point Blank, If you need a song to go w/ a passionate night of Love making w/ 'the one' then this song is a must-have. <BR>As for Ashanti... she should take a lesson from Beyonce for her next album. Oh, but wait then 'the princess' would have to learn how to sing.. never mind.
B00003CXIP|3.0|(Instead of reviewing a film you probably already know, I stick to DVD special features)<br />Those Extras:<br />Commentary:  Needed more.  Reiner several times will disappear and important ground will not be covered.  Stuff like locations or casting get overlooked and annoy.  At least he nicely details the train bridge sequence.<br />New Interviews:  Terrific.  Wheaton, Feldman, O' Connell, Reiner, Dreyfuss and even King hark back to the shooting.  Oh to have gotten to hear Phoenix as well :(.<br />Music Video:  Though the late River is missed, it was immensely fun to watch him and Wheaton rock out with Ben E. King to the title tune.  But where are Feldman and O' Connell?<br />Overall:  Good for a rental, cuz that's it, gang.  This needs SO much more.  A behind the scenes look, outtakes, deleted scenes, the trailer isn't even on the disc!  The &quot;Karate Kid&quot; is instead!
B0000AXE8I|3.0|Ok, this movie is definatly not as good as the first and is not for everybody. But I did find it entertaining. There are alot of parts that are extremely dumb and corny but then there are some others that are just so cool. And even the dumb and corny parts have something cool about them, even if it is something very small...<BR>In my opinion it is worth seeing at least once, so go see it and judge for yourself.
B000059Z8J|4.0|(Instead of reviewing a film you probably already know, I stick to DVD special features)<br />Those Extras:<br />Commentary:  Dang, they just missed.  Donner and (uncredited) scriptwriter Mankiewicz fill us in for nearly two and half hours, but I still went away somewhat unsatisfied.  Unfortunately Donner is a would-be jokester, and needs too much prompting from Mankiewicz on how a scene was done.  Rarely does Donner offer how an effect was achieved, which this DVD would especially be made for.  So many stunts with plenty to tell, but only half of the great shots are explained.<br />Behind the Scenes:  WOW.  Not one, not two, but three different half hour looks at how things were put to film.  Hosted by Marc &quot;Jimmy Olsen&quot; McClure, everything you could want to know about the flying effects or whatever is answered.  Though it would've been fun if they included the double-documentary produced in 1982 hosted by Reeve that TBS used to air (glad I taped it back then :)).<br />New Interviews:  Awesome.  Sure, Kidder, Donner, Mankiewicz, and an archived Brando are here, but even Reeve in his current unfortunate state, and Gene Hackman!<br />Deleted Scenes:  Total fun.  The original two and a half hour cut is pieced together here, but also included in a deleted scenes only section.  <br />Screen Tests:  Damn amazing.  To see not only a long haired, skinnier Reeve, but all the actresses who didn't get the part of Lois!!  Anne Archer, Leslie Ann Warren, among others.  For those who care, Ursa, the female villian of part 2, is read for by various ladies as well.<br />Isolated Music Score:  Well, for lovers of this score such as myself, this is a real treat.  Out of print CDs are no longer needed to be hunted down, heh heh.<br />Overall:  I feel so bad, only giving this four stars.  So much care was put into it, but lack of bloopers---one of my favorite supplements---are not included.  But that's a very small carp to a wonderful DVD offering.
B000085RTZ|2.0|After buying and listening to Kamelot's prevoius release, Karma, I wondered how things could get any better. Karma was just a complete metal masterpiece anyway you look at it. Now a year later we have Epica... and, as I feared, Karma easily wipes the floor with it.<br />Why the hate? Here is my reasons for my rating...<br />1. The lyrics are just bland all around, really no catchy choruses at all, just total lack of energy, nothing to headbang to.<br />2. What the heck is up with all these interlude tracks, I'm sorry, but if you want a intro for anything, be it just the intro for the first and only song (ex. Regalis Apertura from Karma, which is cool.) Why do bands go to the trouble making these &quot;in-between&quot; track tracks, I'm just gonna skip over them, and I'm sure I'm not the only one, even if the band is trying to tell a story with them. If the tracklisting says 17 songs, I don't want 11 real songs and 6 mini-songs.<br />3. The overall impact of this cd just leaves my to wonder, these are the same guys on Karma? The band performance isn't up to par. This is mainly due to the lackluster lyrics.<br />Dispite these reasons, the CD actually has a few decent tracks: &quot;Center of The Universe&quot; is basically like the &quot;Forever&quot; of Epica, and is the best track, and &quot;Lost and Dammed&quot; is decent.<br />Yeah I know what your thinking &quot;he compares everything to Karma, Karma this and Karma that. So what... to me Epica will always be a terrible record in the light of Karma.<br />Well there's my opinion, take it or leave it...
B00005JM1Y|5.0|I watched this a few weeks ago and laughed more than I have in months.  It is absurd of course, but so well done that the absurdity is comedic.  If you have not seen it you should.  I heard many others in the theater laughing as hard as I was.  I also plan to get the DVD.
0316666343|4.0|In Lovely Bones Sebold puts so much emotion into it. She makes the characters so real. It got me thinking what my heaven would be like and who i would see. <br />Susie Salmon was a 14 year old living her life like any average teenager. After a horrible encouter with a cerial killer who was her neighbor. Susie finds herself dead, on the cold snowy day in December 1973. Her killer Mr. Harvey hides the body he had raped and murdered in a very clever place, leaving only two people who knew the truth of what happened to Susie Salmon that cold winter day. <br />Susie watches her family from her heaven that consisted of only her simplest dreams. she watches them as if it were a movie, sitting there being able to do nothing to help find them find the missing peices to the puzzle. Susie could not walk up to them and tell them that where her body was or who had killed her. She simply had to sit and pray that they would soon find out who the killer was.<br />Susie watched over her family through their sad loss. As her dad would stop at nothing to find out who the killer was, and her mom just huddled up in a ball away from everything, and her sister who was only one year younger then her deal with her sisters death and the rumars kids spread at school. Susie also watched as her much younger brother tried to understand what had happened to his sister.<br />As time goes on her death becomes less and less imprtant. The detectives search but get tired as they are getting no closer, but her death huants Mr. Harvey.<BR>Susies still tries to talk to people, and get real close to a girl named Ruth they never really knew eachother but they have a connection that helps ruth with trying to find out who killed Susie.<br />This is a story that willl touch you and make you appreciate life a little more.It may alsotake away some of your fears of death, and give you a little courage to move on.
B0000931OG|2.0|I bought this album hoping for a continuation of the type of music to be found on their best-of CD.  Instead, I ended up with a disjointed, boring collection of very similar sounding tracks.  I think they could've tried harder.
B000002HAF|5.0|&quot;Where is my mind&quot; blah blah blah...Nirvana..blah blah blah.<br />Listen kids.  The Pixies are finally getting their dues...you've missed your chance, the bandwagon has already left the station.  But you've still got a chance to hop aboard and ride it as it transforms into a UFO and launches into outer space.<br />Simply put, this is one of the greatest albums of all time.  No guitar band since has musically topped this accomplishment, although many have borrowed and tried.  You don't have to believe me,  but that's your problem.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|Matrix Reloaded needs to take some lessons from BLADE II.<br /><br />1) Keep the same atmosphere.<br />2) Develop ONLY necessary characters.<br />3) Physical relationships can be best served by the imagination.<br />4) Same reason for being (kill vampires), different storyline (killed vampires in the first Blade - kill different vampires in the second Blade).<br />5) Don't reinvent the wheel (i.e., enjoy the same success as the first by not deviating from premise of story).<br /><br />It's hard to believe the people behind the first Matrix were involved with the making of Reloaded.  Actually, it's even hard to believe the makers of Reloaded even saw the first Matrix.  All of the pluses of Matrix were not evident in this sorry excuse of a sequel.  Where's the eerie, foreboding, and dark atmosphere that added a sense of \\"pins and needle\\" drama?  Every piece of footage of Zion should be laying on the editing room floor, along with some fight scenes, and atleast 30 minutes of monotonous dialogue.  Zion would be best served by leaving to the imagination.  By showing us Zion they minimized the impact of what Morpheus and his crew are doing, their actions are all of a sudden without meaning.<br /><br />Another thing that could have been best served by leaving to the imagination was the Neo and Trinity devotion.  I expected them to be holding hands in the fight scences.  I'm all for relationships and extremely happy Neo and Trinity found each other (good for them), but they need to internalize there feelings when they are supposed to be fighting for their survival (i.e., Blade and Neesa in BLADE II).  It's amazing what one can gather from a single glance and smile.<br /><br />TOO MUCH DIALOGUE.  I'm surprised Neo didn't have a sore throat after all the talking with Agent Smith (who said more in one scene then he did in the entire Matrix), the Oracle (who really should not have tried to talk with candy in her mouth- very unOracle-ish), and the leader of Zion (who was kind enough to give Neo a talking tour of a place I personally didn't care to see).<br /><br />TOO MANY FIGHT SCENES.  We get it, Neo can kick massive butt!!  Let's move on from the fight scenes and put more effort in a decent script.<br /><br />WHY REINVENT THE WHEEL?  Instead of keeping the dark atmosphere, sense of urgency, and character developement of the first Matrix, they went ahead and reinvented the wheel.  They developed too many characters that added nothing to the movie and only served to dilute the message.<br /><br />It was as if the movie makers went out of their way to intentionally sabotage this movie.
067144901X|5.0|My 15 month old son  just loves this book.  He walks arounds saying La La La when he wants us to read this one to him.  I highly recommend this one.
B000089RVR|5.0|The more I listen to this album, the more I like it.  I got the same feeling with her first album too.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This album is brilliant. Maynard, Howerdel &amp; Co. will keep you hooked till the end of this 50 minute masterpiece. The entire CD resonates with a unique sound all its own; a musical journey that guarantees you'll be craving for more with its conclusion on the twelfth track. Standout tracks include \\"Gravity\\", \\"The Noose\\", \\"Weak and Powerless\\", and \\"Blue\\".
B00004TH7Z|2.0|Excuse me, I felt like quoting &quot;Can I Play with Madness?&quot;.  When I heard that Bruce and Adrian were back in the picture, I was happy but at the same time sad, because they have put out some amazing material.  (Check out Dickinson's solo stuff and Smith's c.d. Welcome to the World.)  But I was going to give the new classic Maiden a chance.  After all, I heard &quot;Wicker Man&quot; on the radio and liked it a lot.  But you know, I noticed that the chorus was a bit redundant.  &quot;No big deal.&quot;, I thought.  Boy, was I in for a surprise!  First of all, the production is horrible.  Second, some of the songs are extremely long.  If the song is long 'cause of a cool instrumental journey (Powerslave, To Tame a Land, Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Seventh Son, Alexander, you get my point) then I'm all for it.  But some of these songs are long and don't build up to anything.  That &quot;Nomad&quot; song?  What was that?  It just had annoying keyboards that didn't lead to anything special.  There's also Janick's playing.  'Nuff said about that.  There's the absence of the trademark harmonies.  They've been replaced by annoying keyboards that make this c.d. sound like Celtic metal - that's NOT a good thing.  Also, a lot of the songs sound as if they were outtakes of the X-Factor.  One last thing.  If you listen, you can here that annoying moronic guitar strumming that was common in the X-Factor.  (Listen to the end of &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot; and you'll know what I mean.)  I feel guilty bashing my all-time favorite band; I know that I'm being brutal.  I just get mad at the fans who blindly give high ratings out of their ignorance.  Have you ever met a Kiss fan?
B000067CQK|5.0|This was my first Bowie recording, and i don't think i could possibly have picked a better one to start with. From Bowie's breathtaking vocals and guitarist Mick Ronson's amazing, lyrical string arrangements on &quot;Five Years&quot; to the gorgeous, desparate affirmation that is &quot;Rock 'n' Roll Suicide&quot;, this disc is beautiful. It cemented David Bowie in my pantheon of heroes forever. <BR>It's not perfect, however. In my opinion, &quot;It Ain't Easy&quot; (the only cover on the album) is far inferior to Bowie's own compositions, although he and the Spiders (especially Mick Ronson) make it sound probably the best that it ever could. To this day i don't understand why a better song, such as &quot;John, I'm Only Dancing&quot; or &quot;Sweet Head&quot;, wasn't put on the album instead. Perhaps Bowie felt that those songs interrupted the flow. At any rate, it's not a bad piece; it's just nowhere near the quality of the other songs. Also of a lesser quality is &quot;Star&quot;, which again is not a bad song - actually quite a good one, and far better than &quot;It Ain't Easy&quot; - but it's still by far the second least-successful track on the album. And finally: in my opinion, Bowie didn't do too hot on &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;. Blasphemy? I would have thought so too, until i heard what he could have done with it. To hear the song the way it should be performed, listen to the recording from the new Ziggy motion picture soundtrack. There's simply no comparison; the live version, with a different tempo and altered guitar riffs, is catchier, dirtier, and rocks way, way harder. I even like the vocals better. I think on this album, Bowie simply got the arrangement wrong on this fabulous song.<BR>Another problem - far more major - is the way that this particular edition was done. The powers that be at EMI removed some of the little things that i enjoyed from the LP and miss here. The mix is altered at the expense (i thought) of the sound's original sparkle, the acoustic bit between &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; and &quot;Suffragette City&quot; is missing, and the count-in before &quot;Hang On To Yourself&quot; is similarly absent. A previous reviewer (Douglas Bailey) noted some other flaws in this edition. All of these alterations, in my opinion, were stupid and needless. The LP version should never have been tampered with. Also, the packaging, though attractive and containing great commentary and photography, is absurdly flimsy. I ended up making copies of my CDs just so that i could avoid taking the original discs out of their sleeves, which was causing undue wear and tear on the spine of the booklet they're presented in. My copy of this edition is barely three months old, and the pages have all but come out of the covers. That average, short-term wear and tear should so readily damage the spine is inexcusable.<BR>Even with all of these caveats, though, this album - for the music alone - is still stellar. Every time i turn it on, it sends a shiver down my spine. For sheer extravagant beauty it's incomparable, and although Bowie has written better material (prime example: the epic title track on &quot;Station to Station&quot;, probably his best work ever), this is still overall one of the finest albums i've ever come across. There is really no word for this masterpiece but &quot;gorgeous&quot;.
6305508550|5.0|Office Space is a story about a computer software technician, Peter, that is sick and tired of his regular routine of working all the time.  His girlfriend makes him go to a hypnotist where he is told to not care anymore, which he doesn't.  Peter quits coming to work and doing as his bosses tell him to do.  He even gets promoted for his ideas while his hardworking friends are being fired.  Jennifer Aniston even ends up being his new girlfriend and she is much better than the first.  This movie is hilarious especially with Peter's two friends from the office and their knack for screwing up royally or just watching them get upset and explode.  Even though it is based on a job done in a cubicle, Office Space, actually makes the job seem fun.  Definitely, this movie is one of those that you will watch once and then eventually find yourself going back for over and over when you stay in for a night.  Not a very good party movie but a definite choice when you want to laugh hard with your buddies or a certain special someone.  It doesn't matter who watches this movie with you because it is an instant hit with anyone who takes the time to sit down and watch it.
0590353403|5.0|In this book the main character is Harry Potter.  His parents died when he was very young.  No one could take care of him so he was taken in by his moms sister and her husband.  He was to live there until his eleventh birthday when he would attend the school of wizardry called Hogwarts.  On his birthday he is taken to buy accessories he would be needing for school like a wand, an owl, and his robe for school; The groundskeeper who was friends with Harrys parents was going to take him to do all this.  The next day Harry would meet two new friends Hermoine and Ron who would tell him how to get on the train and tell him about the wizardry that goes on at Hogwarts.  After getting off the train they went to the main hall where the new students got in line to see what group they would be in.  It turns out Harry was in Gryffyndor, the same as Ron and Hermoine.   Harry showed some skills when riding a broom so he was referred to join the Quidditch team.  Harry had detention and was sent to clean the forest there he had an encountered the man who killed his parents.  The next day they found out someone was robbing an important artifact from Hogwarts.  Harry and his friends went through many obstacles to get to the man stealing it.  The man was a Professor who was fused with a man that killed Harrys parents and he battled the man using his wizardry powers and with a little help form Professor Dumbledore they destroyed the stone.  Harry and his group won the House Cup that is given to the school with the most points that is accumulated for the whole year through various activities.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|Scarface is the realistic portrayal of the classic rags to riches story.  A Cuban immigrant named Tony Montana is able to make connections with a local drug dealer and eventually take over his empire.  Al Pacino does a great job portraying the power hungry man who is willing to do whatever it takes to get what he wants, the world.  Even though this movie is pretty serious, it can still make you laugh because of Tony's jokes, and episodes around Miami.  Even though Scarface is a little long, this movie is a must see every couple weeks or so because the vivid scenes stick in your mind.  All you can think about is going back and watching the story unravel every time.  Scarface definitely has the ability to be a party movie but only in some circumstances.  If your audience is mostly men, then it would probably be the talk of the party.  If some girls are thrown into the mix, you may have a mixed reaction from them due to the graphic content.  Everybody I have mentioned this movie to or has seen the poster in my room has said that they love the movie.  A pretty big margin of people have never seen the movie or heard what it's about though.  However, after describing a little bit of the movie to those people, they say they would like to watch it to see it for themselves.
B0000C8AQM|5.0|Wondering if someone could identify two songs for me.<br />First, the song that jack teaches Zack when he sets the band up for the first time. Not Iron Man, but the other song (the one the entire group eventually plays).<br />Second, the song that Jack is singing to himself when the two girls offer him the School of Rock band name.<br />Thanks
B0000A02TZ|5.0|Animal House is the wacky tale of the Delta fraternity at Faber College that just doesn't seem to fit in.  Instead of having sophisticated dinners with their pledges, they decide to throw a huge party and basically if you show up, you are in.  Once you pledge Delta however, you need to watch out because these guys could get you in a lot of trouble: from stealing meat from a grocery store, getting you in trouble with the dean, angering your ROTC leader, forcing you to steal your brother's car, and ruin the homecoming parade.  If you can't keep up, it's better for you to find a frat that is a little more refined than this group of delinquents.  This movie is a non-stop laugh fest in which you better not eat or drink because you will end up choking or spitting it back out.  A definite must see every week or so because you will never believe what these guys will do for a good time and it causes you to have one as well.  When it comes to showing Animal House at parties there is almost no competition because partying is all that the guys in Delta want to do.  I haven't met a person that didn't like Animal House and if I ever do I would automatically assume they are a nerd because that means they either have no sense of humor or don't like to have fun.
B00005JKHN|5.0|I am a 15 year old teenager. I have been watching Sleeping Beauty since I was 2 years old and until nowadays I am drawn to watching it once every two weeks. Ebveryone thinks that itis strange for a girl at mt age to watch Disney movies, but this movies are the best, specially Sleeping Beauty, because it rescues the concept of real love, long forgotten, in pure innocence, without any sexual innuendos, but exploring a child's imagination.<BR>  This movie has an unique touch, the main characters, Aurora and Prince Philipe, almost don't have any major lines; they just transmit their feelings through their eyes. This movie can get inside your feelings by the melody and the beuaty of nature and colors, it also makes you forget reality and start beliving in your own dreams!
B00005JM1F|5.0|Old School is about three guys whose lives are heading down the drain fast and the only way they can see to get out is to start their own fraternity.  Granted some of the members in the frat don't even go to the college, these guys are the talk of the campus.  They may be loved by the students but the dean of the college is an old acquaintance who would love to see this guys crash and burn.  In order to keep their brotherhood together the guys are forced to complete a series of tests to prove their merit as a legitimate fraternity.  Old School is so funny that you have to watch it more than once at a time.  If you have not see this movie then you are truly missing something that is almost spiritual.  A constant urge to watch this movie is there seeing that I have viewed it at least fifty times by now and constantly quote the characters.  Not only is this movie perfect for a party but anytime is a perfect time to put it in and enjoy.  Never have I met a person who doesn't love this movie and the people I meet who haven't seen it shock me terribly.  If you see one movie at all in your lifetime, the obvious answer should be Old School.
0385504209|5.0|I very much enjoyed reading this book and I could not put it down. Yes it's true that it's not the best written book in the world but it does keep you reading and wanting to learn more about the topics covered in the book. I think that the book serves its purpose, it entertains you, keeps you guessing and keeps you reading. I think that all the bad reviews are from frustrated authors that have not been able to publish their books. Books are supposed to entertain you not bore you to death so who cares if he has a one page chapter here and there and all the other ridiculous comments people have made. I have shared this book with other friends who have read it and they too have liked it. It's a good book! Of course if you want a book to put you to sleep don't buy this one. Ask the people who gave this book a bad review what they are reading. I'm sure that will work.
B00006LJ6X|5.0|I'm a relatively new fan of Chicago, and since buying their box set this past summer, I've now been buying some of their remastered full albums.  The DVD in that box set includes a live performance of &quot;Devil's Sweet&quot; from Chicago VII, which I was really impressed by.  So I picked up this CD.<br />The first half of this CD really blew me away.  All instrumental jazz!  These were similar to those long jams on the first couple of albums, which I like a lot.  But definitely more jazz here.  What's most incredible is all 7 of these guys contribute equally to the sound.  You can hear everybody, and everybody even gets a chance in the spotlight without stepping on the rest.  All but one member individually wrote at least one track (and even that one member, saxophone/flautist Walter Parazaider, still co-wrote some songs). Not all pop fans are going to like these long instrumentals (they even admit in the liner notes that such jamming is more self-indulgent), but speaking as a musician I think it's easily some of their best work.<br />Even if you're not so much into the instrumentals, there's still a lot of great music left on this CD, which was originally released as Chicago's last original double album.  The second half gets more into the songs you've probably heard as singles.  These were generously represented on the box set too.  The songs, &quot;Happy Man&quot;, &quot;Call on Me&quot;, &quot;Wishing You Were Here&quot; etc. are also great.  And they flow well with the rest of the album; they don't sound like singles put on there for making money.  <br />Chicago VII has beautiful free-form material that you just didn't hear in the 80s from Chicago.  I don't accuse them of &quot;selling out&quot;; they're just one of countless victims of the 80s corporate music take over.  But Chicago VII is a shining example of what a truly talented band is capable of, when they're given full artistic control.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|When I first saw this in the theatre, I felt a bit let down.  I had been waiting and waiting for this movie since I heard they were doing sequels to the original and Reloaded just didn't measure up to what I expected. It's a rare movie that can live up to unreasonable expectations (which is why Lord of the Rings is so amazing, but that's another story).<br />Seen several months after the original release and with expectations suitably kept in check, this movie is actually pretty good. There's some excellent action and great fighting, interesting plot twists, and a good cliff-hanger ending that sets up the concluding chapter. One advantage of the DVD release is to be able to play through the critical scene between Neo and the enigmatic Architect. I left the theatre scratching my head, but I think I kind of get it now.<br />The big let down with the DVD is the lack of extras. Given the way the state of the art has advanced in terms of DVD extras (see the extended Fellowship of the Ring release as perhaps the best yet), the Matrix doesn't keep up. I know the Waschowski brothers like to keep their mystique, but the first Matrix DVD had a commentary from the visual effects people and some of the cast -- surely, Reloaded could have done the same. It certainly smells like there will be a Matrix Reloaded UltraUberSpecical Edition coming out at some point. I don't mind that, but at least let us know that there will be a better edition coming out later, so we can choose how to spend my dolalrs with full information. I for one will not be biting on a later Special Edition, simply out of principle.
B000006YO2|4.0|&quot;Bryan Ferry&quot; once sang with &quot;Roxy Music&quot;, and between them there are many collections. &quot;Bryan Ferry&quot; himself has no &quot;best of&quot;, that I'm aware of, other than an album of his ballads. &quot;Roxy Music&quot; has one, but no &quot;Ferry&quot; solo stuff on it. Then there are a few &quot;Roxy/Ferry&quot; collections around. The 20 track &quot;Street Life&quot;, which is pretty good, but out of print. The &quot;Ultimate Collection&quot;, which is 15 tracks, not as good, and out of print. Another entitled &quot;More Than This&quot;, which is roughly the same as this one, and out of print. And Finally this one, which is also called &quot;More Than This&quot;, and IN print, but is an import. These are all fairly similar, in length and song selection, but the others you may have to search more for. But between them all, I think this one has the best &quot;Roxy Music&quot;, and &quot;Bryan Ferry&quot; songs, just at an import price. So you could get this, or look through the used stores in town for the others. Or you could always just get &quot;Avalon&quot; from &quot;Roxy Music&quot;, or &quot;Boys &amp; Girls&quot; from &quot;Bryan Ferry&quot;. Luckily, it's all incredibly cool.
B00005JKZV|4.0|But for some reason, some guys just won't get over the fact that you can't always do stuff the same way. You know why comic book adaptations don't always follow the story of the comic book? Because it is a MOVIE.<br />I loved the first movie. This movie is so-so. On one hand, I gave it 4 stars for the action scenes, some comedy, a great music score, and some great characters. The scenery is incredible, and the extras are pretty big. I watched the first special edition extras and they really show you that the movie takes a LOT of time. So basically you will want to check that out.<br />The subtracted star? I don't think that the Sam/Frodo parts were good enough to live up to the Aragorn/Legolas/Gimli parts. I mean, it is really boring because Sam and Frodo have basically ZERO action scenes. They take around a rather annoying creature like dude called Gollum, who is just boring after a while. He isn't funny, and his mental psychotic scenes do tend to get old. The helms deep scene is the best, but then we have to switch over to feremir who will never live up to the great boromir.<br />I don't know, but whenever I skip across most of the ent/Sam and Frodo parts the movie is cooler. I don't read the books, but Aragorn and company have some of the coolest scenes ever and it is really a mood breaker when you have to watch some guys take around a mentally challenged Gollum.<br />Seriously though, The Helms Deep Stuff is AWESOME and a few of the other fights. But they love just going off on the most random things sometimes.
B000002KHY|4.0|I imagine this is one of the best selling collections in history. I mean, who doesn't like this guy? He's like &quot;John Denver&quot;, great songs that always put a smile on your face. These are mostly his best and biggest hits. 12 songs of just simply good and easy music. Included is &quot;Fire and Rain&quot;, &quot;Carolina in My Mind&quot;, and the almost rockin' &quot;Mexico&quot;. Practically all of these are sing-a-longs. I could also suggest the recent &quot;Best of James Taylor&quot;. That includes every song on this cd, plus 8 more. It might be the better deal. Whichever one you choose, when you play it, you'll know that &quot;You've Got A Friend&quot;.
B00006WUWQ|3.0|EXPENSIVE! What is this, 60 bucks for 3 movies that you can buy for 10 dollars? I wouldn't waste your time on buying 3 seperate dvds for 60 bucks, just go buy them individually.<br />The movies themselves are...<BR>Movie 1-Great, new fun and perfectly cast. Everyone loves the first Austin Powers.<BR>Movie 2-The best of all 3. This movie introduces mini-me and is the funniest one of them all.<BR>Movie 3-Terrible, it lost everything. The jokes are all repeats, and Byonce has absolutely no chemistry with Mike Myers. We see her talking to him then BAM they are partners and it is almost stupid that he has to find ANOTHER new girl.
B000008M54|4.0|This is one of those albums, that is so not what I normally listen to, and everytime I put it on, I love it even more. It's so refreshingly different from what's on the radio. I'm not sure where these guys are exactly from, but I can close my eyes and see them rocking some bar in County Cork, southern Ireland. The singers voice matches the music well, and it's all just a great mix of folk, punk, and traditional rock, with traditional instruments. The song \\"Fishermans Blues\\" was in the opening scene of the movie \\"Waking Ned Devine\\", and fits well there and here. Another favorite is \\"And a Bang on the Ear\\". It's so good, as is the rest of the album. I suggest fishing for this cd, you might get hooked.
B00005JM0B|4.0|I dislike the movie overall. It is too much like terminator 2. The graveyard scene, the whole terminator with emotions, and even the car chase is a little like terminator 2. The soundtrack is awful compared to T2, which has the best soundtrack EVER. But the movie does have action. Mabye a little comedy.<br />ACTION thats all that matters in the movie. Everything else is crap, but the action is great. The car chase where the sidewalk and stuff is decimated is pretty cool. There is more action, and some good effects.<br />The problems still. If you are looking for a good movie, forget it. The T-X is terrible. The bad guy in t2 was almost indestructible, but the T-X is killed so easily that she is almost a joke. The whole thought that machines would suddenly switch to a female terminator is stupid. <br />There is the problems I mentioned, but the biggest one is the ending. Well, theres this one part where they try to get into this super secret place but they are not told about the super secret place really. They use this book to find a code which gets them in, yet they were told that the place led them to somewhere else, so how did they get the code for the actual place they went to? I know that sounds really confusing, but when you see the movie mabye you will understand what I mean, not many others did.<br />The ending itself is terrible. Don't expect anything, you have to wait now for T4. WOOOO I cannot wait for that not to happen! No offence, but Arnold is getting way too old for this. I mean you can tell that he is getting older, so it is kind of ruining the point.
0312305060|2.0|I really don't understand why this book is so popular.  Cunningham, instead of putting together three stories that play off each other, offers obvious parallels - carefully placed but without any life behind them, the work of a decent craftsman and not an artist - with a twist that kept me guessing for exactly five pages.<br />I remember reading a review that praised his impersonation of Virginia Woolf's style, but didn't seem to realize that perhaps Woolf's style was there for a reason, that it was the only way to animate the material that she wanted to write about.  Cunningham is merely aping, and for no particular reason other than the fact that he decided that one of the three stories should be about Virginia Woolf-and then, lamely, had one of the characters reading Mrs. Dalloway and another named Clarissa.<br />Woolf's suicide, incidentally, came many years (and books) after Mrs. Dalloway-and is not connected to it in the way that Cunningham implies, and only because the commonplace association exists between the madness of the soldier in Mrs. Dalloway and Woolf's recurrent mental health problems.  Placing these stories together offers nothing but surface understanding.  No novel that has receiving so much praise recently is less worth rereading.<br />The only reason this book needs to exist is to bring people to Mrs. Dalloway and, even better, To the Lighthouse.  Otherwise, it is just a bunch of wax sculptures with some pretty parts.  I don't think that Cunningham, incidentally, is a writer who should be a novelist.  He is better at illuminating small moments -- exploring types vividly, for a few pages -- than creating characters that have sustained life.  His short stories are actually very good: this book is just very average.
B00008H2LB|5.0|This CD is again a masterpiece written by Linkin Park.  Every song on the album has a different sound to it while each incorporates rock and rap.  This album has literally been in my CD player for months at a time.  Linkin Park fans will greatly appreciate this album.  The rapping goes right with Chester's vocals and fits into the songs wonderfully.<BR>You will not be dissapointed, this album is a must buy!
B0000AXE8I|5.0|Amazing, simply amazing. One of the most successful part two's of a trilogy to date. Those who say this brings nothing new to the Matrix apparently weren't watching the same movie! Smith can copy himself, and apparently leave to the real world now. Neo has mastered his abilities, which makes for an amazing fight sequence that I can only hope is topped in the third installment. We meet more of the &quot;resistance&quot; of Zion. The Battletech-esq Mech that guards the gates to Zion made me scream for joy! Some scenes (such as the programmer) make more and more sense the more you watch the film, giving you a new outlook on the movie as you gain understanding of the Matrix itself.<br />  If you do not know, Reloaded and the soon-to-be-released Revolutions were filmed as one long movie, and then cut in half. So expect all the lose ends to be wrapped up in the third and final instalment of what can only be called the most ingenious and creative trilogies to date!
B00000JMQE|1.0|I have never written an online review, but I felt compelled to warn anyone who thinks of buying this DVD that this film is probably the single worst film ever released...Do not go near this one...The production values are laugh-out-loud terrible and the storyline is completely uninteresting. Do not go near this and who gave this film 4 or 5 stars??? I am shocked
0385504209|3.0|This is good hack work, but for insights into early Christianity I much prefer THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF JESUS CHRIST by Neil Elliott.  This book begins with standard characters, then devolves into a so-called mystery the answer to which presumably will rock the foundations of the Catholic church. But it's just laughable that the New York Times gave this high praise, and shows how far their reviewers have fallen, and how little they understand Catholicism.  Most Americans are not Catholic, and even those who are are not preoccupied with it.  Da Big Mystery Exposed would draw a ho-hum from most of them.<br />This is beach reading that will impress New York intellectuals as deep and weighty, since they understand Christianity, the Vatican, and Catholicism not at all.  But when the spook jumps out of the closet and yells &quot;boo&quot;, most Catholic readers will just shrug and say &quot;So what?&quot;
B0000C7PQK|5.0|Enigma blew me away with their fourth album \\"The Screen Behind The Mirror\\" from early 2000. In many ways, it was a whole new change in style from anything that they had ever done before then and marked the beginning of a totally new era in their career. I have no idea where to begin on explaining how stunning and deep their fifth album \\"Voyageur\\" really is. This album is a whole new chapter in Enigma's arc of music and in ways, a whole new Enigma may be emerging. The album doesn't having any Gregorian Chants nor does it have a lot of ethnic samples like their previous albums did. \\"Voyageur\\" does use some of the styles of \\"Turn Around\\" from the LSD collection but while that song while pretty good, it was relatively unremarkable by Enigma standards, this album improves that style. I completely and totally object to all the negative reviews that I've been reading on here about them not bringing Gregorian Chants on here at all. Enigma has never sounded better. This album did not disappoint me the slightest.<br />\\"From East To West\\" begins the voyage into the future with a warm and moody ambience along with the trademark flute intro melody but instead of being a 1 to 2 minute intro like it was on their previous albums, it instead becomes a haunting and moody song with Euro-style dance beats combined with a dark and moody New Age melody. In ways, Enigma break the mold by making the first track on an album being a full length song instead of just an intro. The title track is dynamite. It begins with alternative like guitars but then becomes a highly edgy and energetic dance song with a very strong Euro dance tinge to it. The throbbing bass guitar rhythms combined with strobe light voice effects give the song a very eerie feel. In some ways, it reminds me of what the techno group Underworld did on their 1994 masterpiece \\"Dubnobasswithmyheadman\\". \\"Incognito\\" is one of my favorite songs on this album. It begins with a male accapella intro but then becomes an intense and menacing song which in a way I could describe as some of the best trance music I've ever listened to. If you listen closely you can hear small excerpts from Enigma's 1990 hit \\"Sadeness\\" buried in the background. Pretty scary stuff I must say. \\"Page of Cups\\" begins with unsettling sound effects that remind me of a large number of bats or possessed seagulls flying overhead and a light tracery beat that gradually speeds up and then the birdlike sounds die off and the song becomes an odd and mellow song with a slightly old school hip-hop oriented style blended with electronic New Age atmospheres. \\"Boum-Boum\\" is absolutely awesome. The song is a highly danceable and very ominous song with crunching bass lines and awesome beat. The lyrics, I must agree with many, are quite cheesy, especially by Enigma standards but the music itself with its thundering beats and intense atmosphere completely overrides the cheese factor. This is one of my favorite songs on this album. \\"Total Eclipse of the Moon\\" is a joyous and cheerful song with a relatively sunny atmosphere and enchanting violin and Cretu on vocals. The only thing that irritates me is that the song is so short and ends abruptly just as you're starting to enjoy it. \\"Look of Today\\" is a very Euro dance oriented dance track. This track, while a very good song, comes dangerously close to being a generic Euro dance number. Still it's a good song but sounds more like it belongs on a remix album. \\"In The Shadow, In the Light\\" is a haunting and rich song with distorted vocals from Mr. Cretu done to an excellent degree. The melody is haunting and intense yet calming at the same time like the quiet before the storm. \\"Shadow, Light\\" wonderfully merges into the ninth track entitled \\"Weightless\\". This is a wonderful brief track. The song begins with haunting percussion and then a minor note melody and haunting echoing vocals from Cretu. Unfortunately the song is very short and ends just as you start to enjoy it and thus it feels sort of unfinished. \\"The Piano\\" is a haunting and enchanting instrumental with a sunny and dreamy, and lush sound to it and piano playing and no lyrics. The ending merges perfectly into the next track. The final song on here \\"Following The Sun\\" is the best closing song I've heard on any of Enigma's albums so far as of now. It's a very intense and a highly enthralling blend of sunny and stormy atmospheres all meshed in one. This song reminds me to a degree of \\"Return To Innocence\\" as it has a very similar melody and bright but haunting mood to it. The song though fades from the sunny cheerful mood and melts into a very dark and spooky dark cloud ambience that reminds me of Delerium's darker material. It almost evokes images of when one's following the sun, only to see it disappear behind dark storm clouds up ahead and into uncertain darkness, leaving one to wonder where Enigma will take us on our next voyage. This brings the album to such a haunting and dark close. <br />\\"Voyageur\\" is a welcome return for the pioneers of New Age/ Pop/ Dance and I can very easily say that this CD proves that Enigma has never lost their punch and in fact, I have to say that they've never sounded better. Must I say that the edition of \\"Voyageur\\" that I have comes in rather interesting packaging design. While the packaging isn't as well done as the entrancing transparent booklet design of their 1996 third album, it is far, far better than that awful digipak packaging. I am so happy to see Enigma evolve once again with this project. \\"Voyageur\\" truly lives up to it's title. It's a totally new chapter in Enigma's history and must be acquired by all Enigma fans. I am definitely looking forward to Enigma's sixth album whenever that comes out.
B00005JLU1|5.0|Crybaby is a must-see for any John Waters or Johnny Depp fan.  Although not to be taken too seriously, it is one of the most entertaining movies made in both the actor's and director's catalogue. Original, fun, hilarious, and visually stimulating...everything a film should be.
B0000AOV85|5.0|I read the online reviews and decided to buy this DVD-- Im a guitar player and a huge floyd fan.  <br />Ive watched this damn thing over and over again- cant get enough.  I was apprehensive due to the fact that I would prefer a DVD of studio footage and sound clips over just &quot;plain interviews&quot;.. but every minute of this is interesting and entertaining.  The &quot;track by track&quot; dissections are VERY COOL- they sit at the board and isolate certain tracks (on Time and Money, especially), and comment on how they recorded it, etc.  The interviews provide info you've likely never heard before.<br />Two huge thumbs up here.
0385504209|5.0|This is the most suspenseful book I have ever read.  And the story of the church and the Holy Grail...  who cares if it is true or not?  Who cares if some of his facts are not right?  This is a fiction book, and a book you just can't put down!  I suspect most of the criticism comes from people who don't want to see their faith challenged, or people that criticize this book based on factual truths/&quot;untruths&quot;.  Read this book for what it is... a fine work of fiction that uses the legend of the Grail to weave a masterful story.  Do not look at this book as a scholarly doctoral thesis on the Grail...  Do not look at this book as a religious scholar.<br />The book is an awesome story, the best suspense book I have read.  I highly recommend this book for everyone!!!
B00004XONN|5.0|Among the landscapes of this brilliant follow up to their classic, OK Computer, rest layers and layers of beautiful electronic, trip-hop, computer buzz, rock at it's core. Once again Radiohead stun the world and put the music industry on it's ear as they reach farther into the realms of alt. rock and deliver an original peice of art. The album once again is fresh and a completely different move for the band. The studdering, in and out repeating bleh kid a, kid a starts it off in 'Everything in its Right Place' followed by a mysterious distant sound of the title track that feels like a dream and then our blood pumps with 'The National Anthem' that by the way would be great. \\"everyone around here / everyone has got the fear / its holding on\\". Then we float along on 'How to Disappear Completely' feeling like we're belly up in a cold lake at midnight. 'Treefingers' is a beautiful haunting instrumental followed by the more straight forward 'Optimistic' that claims 'Big fish eat the little ones / not my problem / give me some\\". 'Idioteque' is a highlight and makes one heck of tune to dance to, it grooves and crackles in smooth majestic turmoil as \\"who's in bunker / women and children first... here I'm allowed / everything all of the time\\". 'Motion Picture Soundtrack' proves once again the Radiohead could be the best at finales where this feels very much like an ending possibly a funeral song as the gates open to the final resting place, the song also has the most impressive lyrics \\"Red wine and sleeping pills / get me back to your arms\\". Kid A is yet another classic from the greatest and most important band in the world.
B000067JBN|3.0|This movie takes an unconscionable amount of time to get going and we are well into the movie before we get to the book's most famous creations -the Eloi and the Morlocks .<BR>The early part of the movie sets about establishing a motive for the time travelling-and the movie discards the notion prevalent in the Wells book that intellectual curiousity is at the root of the desire and instead gives Guy Pearce a personal motive ,that of trying to prevent the death of his fiancee .In my view this is both a departure from and a cheapening of the novel which also seriously undermines Wells' philosophy by abandoning the authors explanation for the Eloi and Morlock -they are descendants of the effete aristocracy and the working class respectively-and substitutes an extra terrestrial basis for the divergence. .<BR>Presumably the movie makers did not have confidence in the ability of the juvenile audience at whom they are aiming being able to grasp even rudimentary pollitical theories!<BR>However we are talking about a movie not a book and judged as a simple minded piece of eye chewing gum this is OK once you get past the slow start and things pick up once the Morlocks  put in an appearance and terrorise the rather insipid Eloi into whose midst the time traveller has fallen .They are striking creations and it is easy to see where the budget of the movie went.Scenes of them hunting the Eloi are stromgly reminiscent of scenes in Planet of the Apes and I suspect it was that movie rather than the Wells novel that was the inspiration for the movie.<BR>I did not find the movie at all well acted ,Pearce was a tad insipid for my taste and the aupporting cast ,with the exception of Phyllida Law as the housekeeper ,was barely competent.Jeremy Irons had trouble keeping a staright face as the chief Morlock and I only hope for mhis sake that the cheque cleared -what with this and Dungeons and Dragons his reputation as an actor os substance is under threat.<BR>Watch it for the Morlocks.<BR>The rest is woeful
B00005JL3A|2.0|it doesnt do good with its wooden dialogue and its crappy acting. basically some moments are way better then others but the blending with zombies and heavy rock isnt great. the suspenseful piano music in the game is better and the games themselves are way better. Anderson directed a ok but boring movie to a great and horrific video game. a dissapointment really
B0000E65V9|2.0|While an official Sony announcement of the song list has yet to be released (should be here soon), fan sites and retailers have posted track listings for this set. Not surprisingly, Discs 1 and 2 are nothing more than just an expanded Greatest Hits package, with more from the first Greatest Hits and a few tracks from The Rising. How many fans don't already own both? <br />The real selling point for this package is the bonus third disc, which supposedly contains the following: <br />1. From Small Things (Big Things One Day Come)<BR>2. Big Payback<BR>3. Held Up Without A Gun (Live)<BR>4. Trapped (Live)<BR>5. None But The Brave<BR>6. Missing<BR>7. Lift Me Up<BR>8. Viva Las Vegas<BR>9. County Fair<BR>10. Code Of Silence (Live)<BR>11. Dead Man Walkin'<BR>12. Countin' On a Miracle (Acoustic) <br />From Small Things, None But the Brave, County Fair, and Code of Silence are previously unreleased songs, while Held Up Without a Gun and Countin' on a Miracle have been previously released in studio versions only and are listed as \\"live\\" here. <br />Personally, I'm disappointed. For all intents and purposes, that means only tracks 1, 5, 9, and 10 are new. The rest are all things most true or long-time Bruce fans already own on Springsteen or benefit CDs. <br />I'd also be bet that any live tracks have been overdubbed and polished rather than being an unedited actual performance. I sure hope \\"Countin\\" isn't from that video shown at the end of most 2003 concerts as fans were leaving the venues. <br />Now look at how many songs are on Disc 3 if this list is accurate. Only 12!!! Even at five minutes each, that would still leave lots of time for more material! Held Up Without a Gun is about a two-minute song! Why all they blank space? Hello, Sony?  Where's the VALUE for the consumer??  This disc is probably less than 60 minutes!!!<br />How many of us are really happy about dishing out the $... list (meaning a \\"street\\" price of about $...) just for basically four tracks out of three whole CDs? Die-hard fans already own \\"official\\" releases of most songs here (Vegas, Trapped, Missing, Lift Me Up, Dead Man Walkin') along with everything on discs 1 and 2. We can also burn/rip our own compilations from the CDs we've legally purchased already. <br />Newer fans (the Born in the USA type) own Greatest Hits and The Rising are not all that likely to dig deep into their wallets in this economy while looking for value for their holiday spending dollars. They have the \\"hits\\" they want already. So where's the real incentive to buy this soon-to-be over-hyped repackaging?<br />What about still unreleased but often bootlegged studio gems like Cindy, The Promise (original band version), The Way, Little Girl, Seven Tears, and so many others that surfaced on The Lost Masters and other boots?
6302759110|5.0|astounding work by Coopola with Gary Oldman(never been more eviler) in the part of Count Dracula/Vlad The Impaler. Vlad's love takes a dive off the building and he curses the church saying when he's dead he'll rise up and kill everyone, then he drinks the blood and leaves. four centuries later Jonathan Harker(Keanu Reeves) comes to do buisness with Count Dracula then Dracula seduces Reeves by 3 lovely vampire chicks so The Count can go take Reeves fiance, Mina(Winona Ryder)as his own. along the way we have great camera work with great scenery and special effects for the vampires and nifty trickery. the part where Lucy spits blood out of her mouth seems a little bit like the exorcist but that was vomit, but it was pretty cool. theres also a cool chase scene at the end where they all gang up and try to kill Dracula. Tom Waits as Renfield is fun and weird. nice horror pic
055357342X|5.0|He has up to this point kept the reader on edge due to the fact that being a main character grants you no immunity to death.  As he returns to the world of A Song of Ice and Fire, he once again takes the reader upon a brutal and exciting adventure.
6304578458|5.0|this is by far one of John Cusacks best movies and one of his great roles as he is a hitman who returns to his home state for a little high school reuion and everyone wants to know what happened to him, including his ex-flame Minnie Driver. other hitmen like Dan Aykroyd and the cops want him either put in jail or dead, but he gots some things up his sleeves. Jeremy Piven adds some spark as a property salesman. great moments include the classic scene when the store blows up, all of Alan Arkin's scenes and it just goes down the line. a must have in anyones collection
B000084T18|5.0|This is one of my best albums i was at the shops first to buy this. any body who likes eminem will love this i know i do.
630575067X|4.0|I liked this one, though the downfall to this one was Jar Jar Binks and thank god he was in less scenes in Attack Of The Clones ... good highlights include when Dath Maul takes on McGregor and Neeson(classic). the pod racing is loud and great and can Queen Amidala change outfits, man. a notch better than Attack Of The Clones. one of the best of 1999
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card is the best book I have ever read. It shows great war tactics and battle strategies and shows what potential kids can have. I thought it was stupid that the enemy was called the Buggers; it just sounds so corny and who would be afraid of a bugger? I wouldn't! I think it is hilarious kids call each other fart eaters and other funny names. I couldn't put the book down when I started reading it because it truly is the best book I have ever read because I love handballing and that's kind of what they do, so when people say the book is childish they're not wrong they just have to look at it in a different way. So that shouldn't affect your decision on whether or not you should read the book. It's positively GREAT, it is seriously the best book I have ever read, but you don't have to take my word for it, read it yourself!!!
0783242808|5.0|this one has a lively cast, I mean really lively. Alyson Hannigan(Willow from Buffy The Vampire Slayer) is a treat as the girl from band camp. Seann William SCott is crazy and insane as The Stifmyster. great comedy with 2 sequels make this series great. also the scene when Shannon Elizabeth bares her frontside is the highlight
B00005JL9B|4.0|You are on your way on a class trip. Sorrounded by all your fellow class mates. Among them are the bullies, best friends, long time crushes, and akward loners that you have known for your entire short life on this earth. You are than drugged and dragged to an undisclosed location where you are told that you are now in a fight for survival amongst your class mates. Winner kills all. <br />This is not a reality any of us expect to wake up to any time soon. This film was made to bring to an extreme light the competitiveness and ignorant structure of the japanese school system. It's a satire of the extreme lengths a government would go to in order to get the youth to fall in line. It's a sign of our troubled times where the young are no longer innocent, and many times they are forced to confront realities that were once years away but now are common place for your average 13 or 14 year old. This is the world of Battle Royale, a symphony of fear and violence. A warning that will never reach the ears that were meant to hear it.<br />This is not a movie about the joys of violence. It is not an anime style fantasy where young kids have super powers and fearlessly kill others for sport. These kids are thrust into their primitive instincts for survival. Making choices that no one should have to make. Would you kill your best friend if it meant your survival? Every possible reaction is explored, from the lovers who would rather die together than play the game, to the internet geeks who use their intelligence to outwit their oppressors. The Director uses classical music to elevate the violence from a mere childish fascination with blood and gore (ala Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill)to a serious situation where lives are real and death is not glorified. <br />It is not as violent as it may appear and it is also not as cruel as one may come to believe. This movie will never be seen by mainstream America because instead of confronting our fears we blame our media for our faults andhide from the agony our young are going through. We pretend to be squeky clean but allow movies like Kill Bill to grace our movie screens. Violence is all right as long as it's for fun. Violence that teaches a lesson is outrageous and immoral. Battle Royale for me was a solemn experience, with a few strange black comedic moments by the brilliant Beat Takeshi. It left me numb and provoked alot of deep thoughts. It's a brilliant film that only a few lucky people will discover.
B00004XPP0|5.0|a trilogy of epid proportions. these are always gonna be classic's to me and the making of them is great. though did we have to see Jabba The Hut getting all horny on Leia, ehhhh. but Han Solo, Chewy, Leia, Luke and the all star, Star Wars stars are great and the secret that shocked the world, Darth Vadar is Luke's father. if you having seem them then see them baby
B0000AR8NK|2.0|Not one of Bowie's stronger efforts. I can't recommend &#34;Reality&#34;. But it is nice to know that David Bowie kept working and recording until his passing. One has to admire such a work ethic.
B00009V7T2|3.0|Well I'm one of the few who are giving this a sorta bad rating.  but believe me kids, there is a reason for this.  One of them being that each song has the same basic artistic drive towards it, thus making the album a bit repetitive.  The quality and sonics of the album are absolutly beautiful, definitly a lot of time and effort went into the production of this album.  But as I was saying with the album being a bit repetitive; it caused me to love the album the first time, but loose all interest afterwords.  oh well.<br />The second reason is that well I'm listening to Wang Chung, and that just sort of kinda makes every opinion biased....
B00000373U|5.0|A recommendation amde to me as I started to expand my musical tastes. It was described as &quot;the perfect winter day album&quot;. In having listened to it as much as I have, I wouldn't entirely disagree. Elliott Smith's Either/Or album is amazing for what it is. The best descripton I have is this title - Raw, Painful and good. As opposed to the following Album, XO (also amazing), there is nothing at all refined about Either/Or. Which suits it to a very different and, simultaneously similar, mood.<br />Give it a listen, give it a chance. This is a must have.
0440211727|5.0|Highly recommended book for Grisham fans.  You will enjoy this one.  I wish I could write like him.
B00000JQFM|5.0|&quot;Surfing...&quot; is an album that anyone who call's himself a rock guitar player should have. A masterpiece from guitar genius Joe Satriani. Amazing in all aspects, a lesson in guitar playing: Tremolo Bar techniques, Wah-wah, great legatos, harmonics, and of course, a great tapping lesson: Midnight.<br />The only thing that could annoy somebody is the feeling that Satch is just too damned focused in his music, and makes no mistakes at all.
0714834491|5.0|The Art of Looking Sideways is a gem. Rather it is a bible of gems, notes, quotes and keen perceptions on a wide spectrum of topics relating most frequently to design and communication.<br />If you are an extremely  boring and ininteresting person, buy this book and memorise it,  you will soon be drinking cocktails with the best of innovators and visionaries. If you're the best of them you already have this book or are named Alan Fletcher.
B00000099Y|5.0|I read on a magazine once: &quot;Tool's Ænima will leave you cleansed or ready to kill&quot;. That's so true. As in other TOOL albums, every part of the band contributes with exactly what the song needs to express the emotion desired. Maynard James Keenan's vocals play a major role here, his voice expresses the anger, vulnerability so well, it's an outstanding voice. Guitar, drums and bass play just perfect in order to reach these emotional states. <br />Technically speaking, Adam Jones, being no technical guitar player manages to deliver some great riffs. Danny Carey on drums has a great sense of what the song needs, no show-off here, just the right thing.

B000002H33|5.0|Master Of Puppets was, is, and will be one hell of an album in the metal genre. Great guitar riffs: fast ones and slow ones. Great guitar solos: furious and technical (not so-technical but still pretty good). Furious and precision drumming and really nice harmonies thanks to Mr. Cliff Burton (RIP).The lyrics are just great. And a nice instrumental on top of it all.<br />In &quot;Puppets&quot;, there's no time to get bored. The crushing riffs will leave you wanting for more. And that's &quot;And...Justice for all.&quot;
B000002KIE|5.0|Ok, a lot of you people diss Good Charlotte fans because they're not \\"punk\\". Anyone with ANY sense at all could see that GC isn't punk. THEY say they're not punk so all of you lil teenie boppers need to get a life and see the music for what it is and what it's not. I like Good Charlotte but i'm not running around screaming \\"they're SOOOOO punk..blah blah blah\\"...i like they're songs, but i also like The Sex Pistols. They kick ass!! So why don't we all just enjoy the freakin' music for a change and stop yellling at each other because you don't agree.
B0000062GK|3.0|Crystal Planet offers nothing but a bunch of songs that sound like a variation from Summer Song. No true evolution in Satch's music. In Joe Satriani, he really explored different styles, succesfully.<br />3 stars just because he plays guitar so damn good.
B0000CNY27|5.0|I'm a fan of all Carpenter's film, my favorite without a doubt is Escape From New York, I didn't really care much for LA, but it was still ok. Anyway, the Special Features for the new Escape From New York DVD look good. Escape from New York was way ahead of its time when it first came out & Snake Plissken is probably one of the most dynamic character is modern fiction. It's a great film and I'm sure this new DVD is gonna make the film even better to watch.
B000002TPS|3.0|Youthanasia was produced to hit the radio stations, that's a fact that Dave Mustaine admitted. The tracks were &quot;slowered&quot; for that purpose, and in the end all went pretty f**ked up.<br />But some of the songs on this one are pretty good:<br />Reckoning Day.<BR>Train Of Consequences with that simple, yet effective riff.<BR>A Tout le monde.<br />All the others sound a little bit..mmmmhhh..i don't know, like they lack a real intention or something.
6305603847|5.0|Unbelieveable! I would never believed that music movie could be so amazing! Well done boys!  The Wall's songs lyrics and melodies gets deeper, more sophistic and better shapes in this film. This film main character is a great actor who's past tries to make him live almost impossible. There are many fine acts:<br />1. A little boy is sitting and writing poem on the classroom where is a cruel teacher who takes his poem and reads it for other students. Little later we can see cartoon part where teacher puts his students on the slaughter.<br />2. Main character is sitting on the chair and his girlfried triess to make him happier without no result. Suddenly, man gets a rage disease. He brokes television, curtais, quitars, window and so on. Finally he gets a big wound and his hand is bleeding.<br />3. We can see a flag of the Great Britain. Later, it turns on the  white cross which is bleeding blood. Blood streams on the sewer!<br />This one the greatest symbol menings what I have seen on the movies! People can't see the truth and their only way to salvation. They miss their change of hope!<br />If don't like Pink Floyd's music, you wont necessarily love this movie but in other way this movie can change your opinion to Floyd's music. In my opinion, this movie could tell for Adolf Hitler...  Finally, Tigers broke free and other new song are great songs to this movie!
B000060P79|5.0|Okay, I *love* this CD. If you're a fan of the whole pop/punk thing, you will definitely like Simple Plan! Their lyrics are fun, the guitar riffs are spiffy and I *love* Pierre's voice. If you like upbeat, catchy tunes, songs like &quot;Addicted&quot; and &quot;I'd Do Anything&quot; are great tracks for you. If you're more into the slower-paced, moodier stuff, &quot;Meet You There&quot; and &quot;Perfect&quot; are two amazing songs... &quot;Meet You There&quot; is my all-time favourite because of the part in the middle with just Pierre, a piano and a little bit of drums... But, if you're just a moody emo kid and you need to vent, you should listen to &quot;I'm Just a Kid&quot; or &quot;Worst Day Ever&quot;. Or, you know, you could just buy the CD for the sole purpose of looking at the adorable guys in the CD insert lol! Or, well, the bridesmaids if you're a dude... But, seriously, these guys are really great musicians. I saw them live in concert, and they were INCREDIBLE! They aren't just a recording on a CD, you know? They can actually PLAY their instruments and sing. I was a big Good Charlotte Fan.. UNTIL I saw them perform live on the MTV Music Awards.. they really did not impress me at ALL! But Simple Plan, they put on an amazing show - tons of energy, very audience-involving. Plus, I got the chance to meet them all and they are all extremely nice guys. Funny guys, too :) Talented guys.
B000006TRV|4.0|Pink Floyd was a intresting band that played a very strange music! It's a some kind miracle that Pink Floyd came so popular and cult band. This double-disc album is their most ambitious protect!  There are many classic songs that you can hear on the radio or disco for exemple Another Brick on the Wall part 2, which came one of the Floyd's music listeners favourites. My own favourite songs are dramatic Mother, brilliant The Thin Ice, aggressive Hey You and awesome Confortable Numb. There are too many ballads on the Wall and some weak lenks for exemple One of My Turns. All in all, This album is just another brick on the great music Wall, which stays there until the end of the world!
0887306101|4.0|Getting into the mind of some of the best traders, they all have several things in common. When reading Market Wizards, you keep saying to yourself, &quot;Yes, that makes sense.&quot; Just make sure you follow these rules in the real world. A little older, the same rules still apply today. It is even fun to read about how some of the trading was done over 10 years ago. Definitely an investment classic. This book should be read by everyone who is serious and committed to managing at least a portion of his or her own money.
B00006AFUR|5.0|Well I recently wrote a review for this spectacular record. I think that they tossed it because I cursed. Only I used a star instead of a letter. Well anyways, I absolutely adore this group. I recently discovered that the singer in this band is Jared Leto (Urband Legend, My So Called Life) It's hard to believe such talent and such a voice comes from this young actor. Well, hey I give him koodo's. Anyways, this band. Man. IT ROCKS. I rented the movie The Core about a month ago, and at the end of the film, there was this beautiful song that I got instantly hooked on. I kept rewinding it to hear the song over and over, and in the credits I saw the bands name, 30 Seconds to Mars. This awesome song is called Echelon. It's very unique. So I went and bought their CD and couldnt believe my ears. I was so impressed. (That being an understatment.) They are talented. Not like anything you've ever heard. I felt like I discovered a new band, (not hearing about them from trl or mtv. They have genuine talent that no band can copy) I played it to my friend and she said \\"Wow, they're really cool. I cant even think of any group that sounds like them. \\" That obviously reflects their originality. The lyrics are well thought out, and like that one dude said, the songs beg the listener to discover what they are really saying. They use metaphors. I read alot of reviews, and most people gave this CD 5 stars, but others, like 5 people, had the same complaints. It was either, they suck live, or their songs are too repetative. First off, give them a break. They are pretty much new to this stuff. Making a live show the best ever takes YEARS of practice and experience. It's hard to perform the perfect show with the noise, and chaos, and a howling hard to please crowd. No band is perfect. It doesnt mean Jared cannot sing. That's his voice on the album, and recording it in the studio isnt cheating. No machine can make your voice sound like that. The guy obviously took voice lessons. Many band singers merely screach and yell and kids think it's so cool. But Jared can sing. He proves it. I highly recommend buying this CD people. Yes, there is a space futuristic theme going on, but it's more than that. You gotta open your mind. Am I the only one not brainwashed these days. Well overall the CD rocks. And the repetition in the songs makes it fun to sing along. It isn't a put you to sleep, make you sick of the CD, kind of repetition. I've been listening to this CD over and over and I'm not bored with it in the least. I own over 200 CD's and this is my fav. That's a rare thing for me, to have a fav cuz I listen to everything almost. I also played this album to my friend's boyfriend. I only played him ONE SONG, and he said \\"Whoa I like this! What it this! Are the other songs like this one.\\" ? Indeed people, it has it's own style which is a dam rare thing nowadays. Sadly, I doubt you'll ever see this band on TRL, MTV, or the radio. Which is good. Cuz people like Britney Spears uses her sex to sell music. She cant sing! There is so much talent out there. Not everything can be played on the radio. But I think this band needs to be acknowledged. Spread the word people. I think only one time I was listening to a song on this CD and it reminded me of Tool when Jared hit a high note. So if you like tool, or Onesidezero you'll like 30 Seconds to Mars. Own this work of art! You wont be disappointed. Track # 9 gives me chills. I love this CD. I love every song on it. Which is also extremely rare for me. It's SO AWESOME!!! Most rock bands sound the same. So girls and guys, rock fans, pop fans, buy this CD. I like rock, but so many bands copy each other and it makes it hard to like one particular band. But this band is truly unique. They stand out. Get it!<br />p.s. Listen to the audio clips. Keep in mind it's only a 30 second sample. It doesnt do the song justice, but notice how he sings in each song. Wow a rock band that actually sings, instead of screaming. And u can hear all the different instruments while he is singing. It's cool and the chorus's are fun and addicting to sing along to. Ok I have talked way too much. Sorry I just love this band. It contains everything I look for in a rock band. It got 5 stars, so I was pleased to see that others too can recognize true talent in such a brainwashed society.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|DoD is just as brilliant as you could expect from a mature, energetic, passionate IM.<br />They're back with a massacre! Montsegur gives me the chills. Powerful rock and a horrible story flowing in the lyrics. And the mystery of the holy grail within.<br />I have listened thru all of IM studio albums and this one stands out as the most shiniest diamond. Best credit goes to the overall quality of the songs. Apart from the opener Wildest Dreams, all of the remaining 10 songs easily fit in the top30 IM songs ever.<br />Here's my provisional top 5 list of IM studio albums<BR>1. Dance of Death<BR>2. Seventh Son of a Seventh Son<BR>3. Number of the Beast<BR>4. Powerslave<BR>5. Piece of Mind<BR>6. Brave New World<BR>7. Somewhere in Time
6305949980|5.0|I absolutly LOVE this movie!!It was created by Tim Burton (awesome)in 1991. Even though Christmas is in the title, it is more like Halloween. It is about Jack Skellington, the pumpkin king of Halloweentown, who gets tired of doing Halloween. He accidentally discovers Christmastown and falls in love with it. He decides to take over Christmas but actually makes it like Halloween with presents (which I wish would happen) and everything starts going wrong. Luckily, Sally, the rag doll who loves him, saves him from disaster. It is a musical (my surprise) and they're really good songs! Danny Elfman makes the songs (also did songs from Spiderman and Chicago,the movie)and plays the singing voice of Jack. And besides that, this movie is perfect! The only movie that can compare with it, I think, is Edward Scissorhands (also made by Tim Burton). Thats not very good for young ones though, but The Nightmare Before Christmas is great for kids! Unless of course, theyre scared of claymation skeletons.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|This is a masterpiece and I enjoy it full stop.<br />It's just so wonderful that all the Maiden magic is now back with a massacre - That being the legend of the cathars and the silent ruins on mount Montsgeur and the valley of the burned below. Best way to relive history, my opinion.<br />Recently I bought Seventh son CD, previously had only the LP. In between I had almost forgotten about the band. When Seventh Son came out I was 18 and now it seems I reinvented Maiden at the best possible time. It's been too long but I'm glad they're back.<br />Looking forward to the concert!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This has got to be one of the most brilliant cd's ever created. The music on this cd will go deep inside your heart and send chills through your body. Songs like the noose and blue will have you listening to them over and over. This is a great cd if you are looking for a more mellow rock, I swear this cd is so perfect it will make you cry. GO BUY IT NOW.

0553277472|1.0|This book is about a man's journey on a motorcycle.  He goes through his past experiences and many of his obstacles.  Many of these obstacles are questions he has about different theories, philosophies, and underlying forms.  This book to me was something if had the choice, I never would have read.<BR> One of the most common thoughts Pirsig wrote on and on and on about was quality.  Seems pretty simple of a thought doesn't it?  Not to him.  He analyzed this thought so much that it couldn't make sense to anyone.  After all this examining he then decides to tell us that everything he has said about quality is wrong and should be forgotten.  This especially made me mad thinking why did he right a book and make others go through that too when it was all nonsense anyways.<BR> This book takes you through Pirsig's sad life.  He doesn't feel and he doesn't do anything but try to analyze different things.  Maybe if he would step back for a second, he would see the real answer.  Maybe he would actually start to enjoy life.
B00005JLWN|1.0|I just finished watching this movie-and in order to try to do the review justice-I actually sat through the whole thing-(just like when I tolerated sitting through 'Moulin Rouge'). -And Can you say....umm &quot;RIP-OFF&quot;!!?? From the Matrix, Resident Evil, and the book &quot;Brave New World&quot;? Save yourself the money and time from watching this silly knock-off from the aforementioned movies/books-and go see/read the real things. Believe-me you are not missing anything.
0743244249|1.0|I think people are just scared to admit that this book is terrible lest they be snubbed by other members of the Book Snob Elite. Unfortunately, Brett Easton Ellis did this story a long time ago - and better.  DeLillo sleepwalked through this one - a total waste of time.  Not worth finishing for any good reason at all.
0679411585|5.0|Perhaps a new modern classic on warfare, certainly one of the definitive books written about the Vietnam War.  Moore has given us both a military history of the battle of Ia Drang and a intensely personal story of those who served there.  It reads like a book written by a military man.  You will not find the beautiful prose of a William Manchester or Bruce Catton, but heart stopping action that will leave you breathless. <br />In this book you will see both the competence and courage of the ordinary grunt, and the incompetence and mistakes of their commanders.   This was not a strategic battle planned out in the corridors of the Pentagon, but, like the Battle of Gettysburg, it just happened. Thus, we have an unfolding of an unplanned battle that changed the course of the war.<br />Moore refuses to vilify the enemy.  Like any good solider, he has respect for the men who opposed him. They are portrayed as men of courage, insight and dedication. If you only had opportunity to read one chapter, read chapter 20: Death in the Tall Grass.  It tells of the story members of the 2nd Battalion surrounded in a field of grass, the terror of that fight is unmatched.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|Definitely better than the first, although I found myself wondering if the party scene early on was entirely necessary, or, if it WAS necessary, if it needed to be as drawn out as it was.<br />Other than that, fantastic.  Can't wait to see the third.
B00005NP04|5.0|Martina McBride does it again.  She starts off with her more upbeat songs, such as &quot;My Baby Loves Me&quot;, &quot;Life #9&quot; and as the album progresses so does the variety of her songs.  &quot;Whatever You Say&quot; shows her range.  Then to &quot;I Love You&quot; where she shows some flare on a pop-influenced song.  She then ends the album with some new songs.  &quot;Where Would You Be&quot;, my personal favorite, shows her range and the purity of her voice.  Overall, a great album thats worth buying.  This album wont dissapoint.
B00004U2G4|5.0|Mere words cannot do this album justice.  All the songs are excellent.  The only one that's below average is the lackluster rearrangement of &quot;Shapes Of Things.  Jeff solos like wildfire on &quot;Let Me Love You&quot;, &quot;Blues Deluxe&quot; and &quot;Rock My Plimsoul&quot;, which is one of the most AWESOME blues songs ever recorded.  The pounding bass and sensual vocals of Rod Stewart make it even better.  &quot;Morning Dew&quot; and &quot;Old Man River&quot; are both haunting pieces of work that take one's breath away.  &quot;You Shook Me&quot; is not quite as good as Zeppelin's version, although you can't really compare one to another.  And &quot;Greensleeves&quot; is pure Heaven.  The most beautiful, emotional notes to ever emanate from an acoustic guitar.  It never ceases to amaze me.  &quot;Beck's Bolero&quot; is a total trip, an otherworldly experience.  I love it when Beck slows down and plays those oh so lovely notes at about 0:34 into the song.  &quot;Blues Deluxe&quot; features some astounding piano from Nicky Hopkins and a BLISTERING solo from Jeff.  And Stewart sounds simply kick-a** on &quot;I Ain't Superstitious&quot;.<BR>All in all, I would definitely recommend this album to any blues/rock lover.  Jeff Beck is unreal, and this is his masterpiece.  &quot;Rock My Plimsoul&quot; alone is worth the price of the album.
B000005JA8|1.0|as pleasant as cancer.  and, expanding on that theme - growth for the sake of growth (as with cancer) is useless; being avant-garde for the sake of being avant-garde is soulless.  this stinks - the entire album reeks of contempt and solipsism.  i don't know what the best album ever written is (or if there is one), but i do know that this is the worst...
B0000C8AQM|4.0|I really love this CD. It's got a great array of songs on it. However, isn't the fourth song &quot;Fight&quot; by No Vacancy and not the David Bowie one? It is on the actual CD, and I was just wondering why it said the other one. Also, does anyone know if No Vacancy has a CD out?
B0000AXE8I|1.0|About halfway through this movie, I wondered if I was sleeping through a philosophy 201 lecture and the professor was intruding on my dream - but no, it was a pretentious screenwriter. Philosophical points in film should be made through the story (such as the issues of reality in the first film, and similar movies like dark city or existenz) not through (very boring) dialog. <BR>Beyond this very serious flaw, the plot of the movie was very weak. At the end of the first matrix, Neo is shot and recovers from the injury completely, and then enters Agent Smith's body, showing that he does not need to follow rules about what is corporeal and what is not. Therefore, hitting him, any of that - does not require martial arts. He's outside of the system, it doesn't work for him anymore. <BR>On the plus side, the entire issue of there being multiple copies of &quot;the one&quot; for a further control of the matrix - that was nice, I liked that it seemed at least somewhat interesting. <BR>On the downside, the assault on Zion - I am not sure that this was done as well as it could have been.
0767821629|3.0|I saw the Matrix and Reloaded before viewing this movie (just to clear the air). I liked it but it was very predictable. One other reviewer mentioned that this film left out the FX in order to be more of a thinking film. Think about what? The Matrix was rich in philosophical, theological, psychological, mathematical, and spiritual content. This movie had dablings, but not much. My wife absolutly HATED this movie. I though it was ok. There was no real &quot;AHA!&quot; moment (though I know where the directors wanted you to say AHA!). Perhaps I'm a bit biased to the Matrix, but this movie did not go as deep and simply skimmed the surface of &quot;what is real&quot;. Next on my list is eXistenZ.
B00007AJF9|1.0|Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush were perfect casting for the historical personages they portrayed.  Unfortunately, the script is such a total distortion of history that they were wasted.<BR>   If you know any history, you know that Elizabeth was no political innocent at the beginning of her reign.  She knew what she was doing and had the sense to listen to Cecil (here portrayed as an impotent fool).  I watched this movie in disbelief of its manifold inaccuracies.  Particularly distasteful was the character assassination of Mary of Guise.
0451167716|2.0|Usually the old maxim of &quot;the book is better than the movie&quot; holds true.  I can think of a million examples, yet strangely, I'm drawing a blank at the moment.<br />No matter, I bought this book to read on an extended vacation.  I never finished it.  Why?  Because it's boring and poorly written.  It's strange, but Coppola &amp; company were able to add the depth to the characters that is sorely lacking in Puzo's novel.  <br />It's not even good as pulp fiction, as say a Raymond Chandler or a Dashiell Hammett is.  This is a lousy book that was turned into 2 of the greatest films ever made.  Why it became such a bestseller in 1969 just proves true that other old maxim:  &quot;A fool and his money are easily parted&quot;.
B000059T1G|5.0|Why this f__king cd has only 7 reviews I'll never know. Its part of the reasoning behind the curse the band Traffic, the potentially best band ever, had. Reason #1 is right up front. Lousy, talentless Dave Mason, who thank god was almost out of there on this one. Reason #2 is the most god-awful hippie-era cover art ever to appear on a truly great record. Jim Capaldi had the nerve to say on his website that he liked this art. Needless to say who is Reason #3.<br />Nevermind. The band had two musical geniusus who had that rare, rare ability of a very few rock bands to reach Nirvana (which, luckily the band bearing this name, had). Steve Winwood and Chris Wood knew how to take rock music to its highest hights, which is about as high as Mount Everest. Skip track one and you have a perfect album, that goes there again and again.<br />buy this, it deserves 100 stars.
B0000AYJXR|1.0|They won't let you rate anything with zero stars otherwise that's what I would have given it.  This is one of the worst things ever created.  I can't even call it a film.  Don't buy it.  Do yourself a favor, buy the Looney Tunes Box set instead.  You won't regret it!
B00005O3VC|5.0|All I can say about this DVD set is that it's absolutely brilliant.  &quot;Holy Grail&quot; is an amazingly funny film made even better by finding out all the little secrets behind it.  I live a few hours drive away from the castle where it was filmed and never even knew it, but now I shall parade around the grounds spouting Pythonisms until they send me home (or put me in a long sleeved jacket and send me to Carstairs).<BR>The Camelot scene (shot in Lego - Disk 2) is hilarious.  They should make the whole film like this.<BR>&quot;Now go away or I shall taunt you a second time&quot;
B000089CJI|3.0|This album struck me right off the bat as something special.  Indie rock, garage rock, etc. has for years thrived off the pulse of guitars and drums and blood and sweat.  What the Postal Service represents is a new breed that redefines the notion of what a &quot;band&quot; is.  <BR>The Postal Service harkens back to the electronic sounds of groups like OMD and New Order.  Replacing that experimentation is a keen sense of melody and lyrical sensitivity.  The Postal Service approach their sound as something to create songs with, not something to merely make noise with.  <BR>It is their lack of experimentation that keeps this album from being a classic, however, though what they are doing is something worthwhile:  picking up the synthesizers and playing them with heart.  Given some more development, a group like this can be truly dangerous.  For now, we can close our eyes and feel the sadness of &quot;The District Sleeps Tonight&quot; or &quot;Sleeping In&quot; and say YES.
0312319517|5.0|Without question, this is one of Frederick Forsyth's best books, and that's saying something since he's written classics like The Day of the Jackal.  In Avenger, he revisits a familiar theme of revenge, one he handles well in many of his novels and short stories.  But Avenger is unique from many revenge novels because it is not merely revenge that \\"the avenger\\" is seeking; instead, it is justice.  Forsyth provides a great character with the man who is \\"the avenger\\" - a character reminiscent of the Clark/Kelly figure in Tom Clancy's novels (featured in Without Remorse).  This book weaves several threads into a larger story; this is well-done, and the individual episodes are good enough to stand alone.  While there are several elements that you see in other novels and in the thriller genre in general, Forsyth shows his talent with his precision of words and quality of narrative.  His writing flows in giving depth to his characters and action to his plot.  Nothing that is necessary is left out, but neither is anything extraneous left in.  Simply a pleasure to read besides being another remarkable Forsyth tale of action/suspense.
B00000K31Q|2.0|This movie is as lame and predictable as many teen films.  Julia Stiles' acting is stale --although as usual there's no denying her screen presence, the dialogue sounds like it was written between takes and the rest of the cast are cardboard cut outs of high school stereotypes.  I'm not knocking teen films because I happen to like teen films even though I probably outgrew them long ago but this one is pretty bad.<br />However, this movie has a few saving graces.  First of all it's a modern version of Taming of the Shrew.  And, it name-drops a few literary giants along the way (due to Kat's unquenchable thirst for literature!). Also, Allison Janney is priceless as a guidance counseler/wannabe romance writer. And, the rantings of Bianca and Kat's father about teen pregnancy are very funny. Finally, the firey Heath Ledger as high school bad boy makes the last half of the film bearable.  I'd throw in an extra half star for these things alone.
B00009TB5G|4.0|Great Film!  First the good news.  Great acting, action, cinematography.  The attention to detail is mind boggling.  The great quandry of an epic film is to sacrifice acting for effects.  Jackson has held true to the characters as well as the main story.  Of course a few of Tolkiens subplots are sacrificed but not out of disrespect.  They simply would not help the film.  For all you Tolkien purists...you just need to b**ch about something!  The truth is that you'll be closet fans of the films right to your graves.<BR>Now the bad news.  Jackson has missed with the Nazgul (ringwraiths).  The films simply do not convey what powerful and menacing creatures they are in the books.  Their very presence sapps the presence of being from any mortal within proximity.  The film does not make the viewer fear them.  Remember how you felt watching The Shining or The Excorcist?<BR>Can't wait for ROTK.
B00005JM02|5.0|This was one of the best movies our family has ever seen.  It rates right up there with Ice Age and Monsters Inc. My husband and I took our three children ages 6, 4, and 2 1/2 to the theater and they all loved it.  Our 2 year old sat still the entire time with his eyes glued to the screen.  The movie was sad, funny, suspensful, and exciting throughout.  You absolutely won't be disappointed in this one.  We preordered a VHS for Christmas this year, and I expect the kids will watch it over and over again as soon as they open it.  My husband and I can't wait to see it again as well!  Finding Nemo is a 10 star movie, not just a five!  Very adorable...you gotta see it!
B000075BFK|5.0|...THIS ALBUM IS HOTT REGARDLESS WHAT PEOPLE SAY IT IS GOOD NOT HIS BEST BUT STILL WORTH UR MONEY 2PAC 4 EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00008LDPU|3.0|All right. I know a lot of the review said this was bad and that the story was useless. Well, this DVD is what seperates those who understand the Matrix and those who still mindlessly think that the machines won. After Revolutions comes out more and more people will realize the truth. Don't be a fool, watch this DVD.
034529467X|5.0|Clarke has returned to the &quot;First Encounter&quot; theme several times and from several points of view.  They all have one thing in common though - the workings of the alien races are at first utterly mysterious, a puzzle for humans to solve.  But slowly, over time, we learn the true purpose (always something other than what is generally conceived).<br />At least he does not fall into the trap of an INDEPENDENCE DAY or any of the numerous copies in which Zoogoo from the planet Glowboh tells us mean Earthlings to stop our atomic testing or we will be destroyed.  Perhaps Clarke is trying to say that the difference in cultural perspectives are so great as to make it difficult to understand the workings of such higher beings.<br />This is a rather innocent book that has retained its charm.  Of course, the weak points are character development, the strong points being the plot line itself and the ultimate realization of our destiny.
B000003TA4|5.0|Nevermind...what can be said about this album that hasn't been uttered a million times before? On this record, Nirvana shows the distraught, messed up, sloppy, honesty we can all relate to. Nevermind pumps out great songs one after the other which is an implausable, if not impossible act...<br />Here are some of my favorites on this record and how they measured up.<br />Track 1: Smells Like Teen Spirit, This song is one of the best songs ever written! Lyrically speaking its a gold mine with the kind of lyrics we can all listen to and say \\"Yeah, I know how that is.\\" This songs lyrics would have easily been enough to carry it to the top, but with Krist Novocelic and Kurt Cobain's monumental guitaring and Dave Grohl beating the drums like a madman with really good rhythm make this song a masterpiece. 10/10<br />Track 2: In Bloom, Beautifully agressive riffs combined with steady but still shocking drumming make this song (about a macho jock type singing along to a song he has not the least bit of knowlege about) the kind you get stuck in your head all week long and dont mind. 10/10<br />Track 3:Come As You Are, In my humbled opinion, this is by far the greatest song on Nevermind, its hauntingly melodic guitaring make it unbelievable, but Kurt Cobain's heart-felt words of acceptance ,make CAYA unforgetable. 15/10<br />Track 5: Lithium, This song is your classic obsessive love song with a NIRVANA twist. Quiet guitar and slightly noticable drums during the refrain, with lyrics that paint the picture of a disturbed person who is trying to convince themselves its all alright. Then, the chorus hits and the guitar explodes in an astounding display of genius and sheer discontent. The songs somewhat disturbing Chorus make this song a classic: <BR>\\"I like you I'm not gonna crack<BR>I miss you I'm not gonna crack<BR>I love you I'm not gonna crack<BR>I kill you I'm not gonna crack.\\"10/10<br />Track 6: Polly, Many people say many different things about this song...thats its a song of poetic justice (A man rapes a woman, is sent to jail and raped himself), a song of how Courtney >shudder< and Kurt were raped by the interview in Vanity Fair that got Frances Bean Cobain taken away, or a ironic anti rape song that was misunderstood by the public, and was actually used as background music in a real rape film...but one thing most people can agree on is its sensational, simply put, its the genius thing most people strive for their entire lives.<br />Track 11: On A Plain, A little less agressive than some of the other tracks on Nevermind, this songs catchy but somewhat undeveloped lyrical direction which plays on a number of things including song writing, his childhood, and tapped into his addiction. The guitar is just as influential as in the other songs on Nevermind as well as the drums which leaves you wanting more.10/10...
0345423496|2.0|Well here we are again with the last installment of a once promising series that lost its way and descended into ennui. Who could forget the fantabulous 2001 or the almost as good 2010.  Somehow the literary aspects of the series seem to decline as the plot advances.  Gone is the initial sense of wonder and mystery; never present is interesting character development. <br />This last gasp seems to try but the old spark is gone. Clark again tries to give us his vision of a glorious future rampant with technology and neat doohickies.  But the real story is the tale of the monoliths and how we must desperately tell the makers of same that we are not the backwards race they may have originally considered us to be. Otherwise they might do bad things to us.<br />Which begs the question - why in the world would an intelligent lifeform send the monoliths to uncivilized worlds and expect a progressive civilization of harmony and peace?  That question, like many others, is never raised much less answered.  All in all, I am glad Clarke wrote the series but a more visionary 2061 and a more literal 3001 would have been a major accomplishment.
6305313687|1.0|The person who said they didn't use the word skinhead in the movie is wrong.  When the police are discussing Norton's character in the conference room they blantanly call his gang the most dangerous skinhead gang.  I found this very insulting considering that I am a skinhead and that the \\"skinheads\\" potrayed in the movie were what skinheads call boneheads.  The real skinhead culture has it's roots in Jamaican music and British working class ethics.  It started in the late 60's when the Jamaican immigrants to Britian brought with them their music and what was know as the \\"rudeboy\\" style.  Young working class mods that were fed up with the Psychodelic scene caught on to the rudeboy scene and came up with their own version of the tough jamaicans....the first skinheads.  They were not racist in any way and were always socializing with the Jamaican and other island immigrant youths.  The fact that the media and major motion pictures only give attention to the Neo-Nazi copycat skinheads not only offends me, but also socially marks me....and if I'm in the wrong place could possibly be a danger to my safety. So, in conclusion, even though I really like Edward Norton as an actor, this movie is horrible and should have never of been made without recognition to the original skinhead movement.
0451450639|5.0|Arthur C Clarke has returned to his favorite theme - that of the proverbial First Encounter.  We've had them in the RAMA series and in CHILDHOOD'S END.  But this time we meet them by proxy.  Everyone is quite familiar with the story but the originality and suprises (aided by an extraordinarily perceptive cinematic translation) just keep coming.  It's like the author is drinking from a well of originality and talent that won't run dry.<br />I loved the man-machine/man-monolith/man-Jupiter interactions.  Clarke has ventured into the metaphysical here and the movie perfectly suggests to the viewer what we, the readers, can only imagine from the text. <br />The idea of an extraterrestrial boost to Earthly intelligence has been suggested before (along with the idea that life itself arrived from outer space via meteorite).  One still has to ask the question:  OK, so where did THAT life come from? Clarke simply assumes that &quot;it is&quot; without questions.  <br />Another theme present in almost all his works is that we on this planet are still children of the universe, we are in the learning stage and must and will learn from the more &quot;advanced&quot; races.  Whether this happens or not - my personal opinion is that it won't - it is still a good concept to bandy about.
B00009TB5G|5.0|If you liked the origanal version of the lord of the rings then you will love this version. Gives you ll the stuff that they left out from the book. And I would imagine a lot more fighting and mybe we will get more that to seens of the ent's destroying Isengard!!!
B00000I8NC|5.0|This album is like most of GYBE's work: beautiful, alarming, tought-provoking--in short, utterly amazing.  &quot;Moya&quot; is one of their best efforts to date; the album is worth buying for that song alone.  The dramatic build of the song is incredible; the climax is incredible; the denouement is incredible.  If you're already a GYBE fan and you're used to Lift Your Skinny Fists and Yanqui, Slow Riot may leave you a little wanting.  It's short.  But it's as beautiful as either album mentioned above.  <br />The second track on Slow Riot features a strange dialogue about the state of American government and music that comments on it better than any words could.  Here we find less of GYBE's drama and more of their skill to arrangement words and music such that the effect is perhaps more dramatic than their most dramatic works.  <br />If you're new to GYBE, don't buy this album first.  Try on something a little longer and easier to digest--Yanqui U.X.O. is a good one for newbies, imo.  But as you become used to them, consider adding this one to your collection.  I find it indespensible for &quot;Moya&quot; alone.  GYBE has no rival in the contemporary scene; they may not even have any equals.  In short, if you like GYBE, you'll like this album.  It's GYBE doing what they do.

B00000IUP4|3.0|You know that is only a matter of time before your child will ask for a powered locomotive for his/her Brio train set. Brio offers a few powered options, this green engine being just one.<br />We were anticipating more fun out of this powered engine, but have been disappointed for a few reasons:<br />1. There is a cutoff switch on the bottom for use with the switch track (available separately or in combo with this engine), but it is placed in such a way that it comes perilously close to the ramp tracks when climbing hills, usually causing the engine to switch off whenever it climbs a hill. Moving that cutoff even a fraction of an inch closer to the rear of the engine would prevent this. Bad design.<br />2. Batteries are every parent's nightmare. We get around this by using NiMH rechargeable batteries in all our kid toys. This engine, though, does not work well with rechargeable batteries, insisting on alkalines - and the most expensive ones at that. Seeing how easy it is to leave it running, this can be an issue.<br />3. Read the instructions carefully before doing anything as it is possible that right out of the box this locomotive will not work unless you do. You have to be careful how you install the battery the first time or else the engine will not run, no matter what you do. And this is not simply a matter of getting the positive and negative ends swapped. It's possible to put the battery in the right orientation and still get no response. We futzed for a while before going back to the manual and \\"priming\\" the engine as directed.<br />4. If you do not have your track perfectly aligned, it will run off quite readily.<br />5. Almost requires the manually-operated switchable \\"Y\\" tracks in order to switch it onto a different track section. The fixed \\"Y\\" tracks will only work perfectly in one direction. If you let the engine decide which fork to take, it will usually run off the track. But if it comes down a fork into the merged section, it will work fine. Still, invest in the manually switched \\"Y\\" tracks.<br />Positives? It's durable. Has a little light up front that is fun. Adds another dimension to your train set. Kids enjoy it despite the deficiencies.<br />In short, though, it's not perfect and could be engineered in such a way to eliminate the problems noted, but hasn't been. Oh well.nvest in the manually switched \\"Y\\" tracks.<br />Positives? It's durable. Has a little light up front that is fun. Adds another dimension to your train set.

0786880708|5.0|I have read it several times and continue to come back to it.
0780631684|5.0|I LOVE this movie (and I'm not biased because Seann W. Scott and Amanda Detmer are in it.) I think this is SO underappreciated.<BR>You see, not only are they not conforming to the typical Teen Horror genre (repeated in just about every review) but they are taking what COULD have been and turning it around.<BR>EX: Characters. Typical personas. Just look at how they put a spin on the classic characters.<BR>THE LONER GIRL (&quot;Clear&quot;) was pretty much dubbed as one of those &quot;misunderstood starving artists with a troubled past.&quot; But then you see that there's more to her than the dark cloathes, the VERY BAD (sorry) art and the boards on her windows. She's pretty spicy, if you ask me.<BR>THE BLONDE BIMBO (&quot;Terry&quot;) hardly speaks, simply looks pretty and makes out with her boyfriend. But in her final speech, you think, &quot;Omg, she's pretty mature.&quot; Makes you sad when the bus smashes her to bits! NOT!<BR>THE GEEK (My personal fave--Billy!) well, is a geek, and you love him, admit it (On second thought--no, he's MINE!) And while he's really kiddish, it's good to see a kid in a teen flick that DOESN'T have their own car, wear kahkis and have an annoying cell/palm pilote.<BR>THE ANNOYING BEST FRIEND (&quot;Tod&quot;) was one other character I couldn't get enough. He was so cute, it was really funny to see best friends that fought all the time.<BR>THE JERKY JOCK (&quot;Carter&quot;) was probably the most exhaggerated character, but Kerr Smith played him well. He was still realistic (not EVERY jerky jock has to have a sensetive side.) And I DIE laughing when Seann Scott is lying headless on the ground and Kerr Smith has pissed himself!<BR>I also liked to see Alex gone crazy. It was funny and scary. This is not like a dark comedy, because it's still horror, it's, uh... a hot dog! Makes you gag, but topped with the best thing in the world--ketchup! How come it doesn't fail? It's packaged by a bun!<BR>I don't want to exceed my limit, but I will justsay--FD is totally original, everything about it is. It grips you. You don't even care about the &quot;flaws&quot; (omg, Alex has gone psycho but it's no excuse to freak out about a kid he hardly knew dying!) and you just want MORE!
B000089RVX|5.0|I don't know why I waited so long to buy this CD.  I absolutely love it.  It's very rare that I like every song in any CD but I truly enjoy listening to all of them in Fallen.  At first, I thought it was a little strange because of the two slow songs.  It seemed out of place BUT after listening to the dark and haunting melodies, I was blown away.  I was amazed at the range of Amy's voice.  It's refreshing.  She's not like the typical rock n roll singer.  I recommend this 100%.  Can't wait for their next album.  I hope they stick around for a long time.
B00001U0DP|5.0|To me, this film is perfect. It has everything--adventure, suspense, romance, comedy, tragedy--all extremely well done by a man whose tender spirit shines through every moment. <BR><BR>The best scene in the film for me is when Guido's love interest (who becomes his wife in the film and really IS his wife off camera), ducks under her table to see Guido, the waiter. When she asks him to \\"take me away,\\" oh my Lord, nothing in the history of film gets any better than that sweet moment.<BR><BR>\\"Life is Beautiful\\" is aptly titled. It is a testament to the beauty of the human spirit. It shows the hatred and horror the human species is capable of, BUT in stark contrast, it focuses on love--the love of a man for his wife, the love of a mother and father for their son, the purest love of which humanity is capable; hence, the triumph.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|When I first saw the Matrix Reloaded back in May... I left the theater with a feeling of 'huh?... what just happened'.  I knew I had witnessed some pretty 'revolutionary' film making, and some pretty impressive set pieces, but overall, the film left me feeling unfulfilled.  After viewing the DVD recently, I can safely say that I'm more satisfied with the film, and it makes a lot more sense to me.  While not as earth shattering as the original or memorable, Reloaded is still much better than most of the action garbage out there today.  And that Freeway scene is worth the price of admission alone.  It's hard for a sequel to live up to the original, and Reloaded doesn't... but it ain't half bad.
B000088E6D|5.0|this all the great CD with a beautiful voice i've ever heard ( based on young male singer ). he has a good talenta, a great voice who can make me feel comfortable, relax.<BR>You great.........Buble ;))
B00005JKC3|3.0|As comic book movies go... you have the elite films, the groundbreaking ones (i.e. Donner's Superman, Burton's Batman, Raimi's Spider-Man), the solid ones (i.e. Del Toro's Blade 2, X2), the average ones (i.e. Blade, X-Men, Dardevil), and the crap (i.e. LXG).  Hulk falls in some where between solid and average.  But I give it more of a solid score for the ballsyness that Ang Lee demonstrates in his unique film style and seriousness with which he handles Bruce Banner's personal demons.  You can debate all you want about the CGI effects, which I feel are hit or miss...exceptional in parts, particulary the dimly lit scenes, and somewhat cartoony at other parts.  But the acting is solid, and the action scenes, particularly the desert chase, are top notch.  This is a comic film that tries hard to stay close to the source material, but may sometimes take itself too seriously.  But I must applaud Ang Lee for taking on a project that is much bigger than the big ole green goliath himself.
B000002I4S|5.0|It's understandable that many listeners may prefer to &quot;Giant Steps&quot; the more accessible earlier or later Coltrane. The former offers up his explorations within more familiar song forms--often the blues; the latter frequently makes the song secondary to the soloist's quest for a rapture beyond musical form altogether. &quot;Giant Steps,&quot; on the other hand, is a musician's album. It set a new standard not only for saxophonists but for all players, requiring a combination of harmonic knowledge and technical facility that sent numerous musicians back to the woodshed for countless hours of practice. Without this album, and especially the title song and &quot;The Countdown,&quot; Coltrane's early work would have seemed short of realizing its potential, and his later work would have been open to increasing suspicion about his actual credentials. Like Armstrong's cadenza on &quot;West End Blues&quot; and Bird's break on &quot;Night in Tunisia,&quot; &quot;Giant Steps&quot; turned heads and gave a generation of musicians a whole new understanding of what jazz improvisation was capable of producing.<br />For the more technically minded, Trane's revision of dominant-tonic harmony is more impressive than his later embracing of modes as the sole platform for his scales and upper register probings. Suggested by the challenging bridge of Rodgers and Hart's &quot;Have You Met Miss Jones,&quot; the sequence moves through a cycle of descending major thirds which, in the hands of most musicians, feels awkward and unnatural. Coltrane not only mastered the sequence but learned how to use it as a substitution in conventional harmonic settings. More impressively, he learned to execute it with an agility and naturalness that makes it possible for the listener to ignore the harmonic underpinning entirely and be swept up by the wave of emotion and melodic inventiveness.<br />&quot;Giant Steps&quot; is the main reason Sonny Rollins temporarily stopped playing in public. To his credit he came up with his own solution to the tyrannous sameness of much pop song harmony, but he was never able to come to terms with the harmonic complexity and technical innovations introduced by Coltrane. On the other hand, few have.credit he came up with his own solution to the tyrannous sameness of much pop song harmony, but he was never able to come to terms with the harmonic complexity and technical innovations introduced by Coltrane.

0792164903|5.0|The night before I watched this movie I watched the classic Disney animated feature, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, and I read the original story by Washington Irving.  <br />Needless to say Tim Burton's marvelous Sleepy Hollow bears almost no resemblance whatsoever to Washington Irving's original story of a nerdy pedagogue and his propensity to out-of-control superstition and fear.<br />But then who's counting.  Why not take classic characters and catapult them into a story that is much, much more intriguing, compelling and, oh yes, frightening than the original? I thoroughly enjoyed seeing Burton's remastering of Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) as an obsessive police inspector whose childhood was marred by some pretty spooky goings on at home.  Crane is assigned to travel to Sleepy Hollow and investigate why the locals are having troubles hanging on to their heads. <br />Christina Ricci is wonderful as a retooled Katrina Van Tassel, a devoted daughter who wants nothing more than peace in Sleepy Hollow and is ready to take some enchanting steps to try to make it happen.<br />And if you thought that Cinderella's stepmother was wicked wait until you get a load of Miranda Richardson in her analogous Sleepy Hollow role.  <br />The gray-toned cinematography is absolutely striking, the Elfman soundtrack brilliant and the special effects are nothing short of spectacular.<br />Forget about this one just at Halloween. This bewitching offering will have you coming back all year round.<br />Douglas McAllister
0553208845|3.0|When I was assigne this book to read over the summer I though, &quot;Hmmm, why waste my time on this, it is most likely boring, and I have much better things to do&quot;. After I picked it up a few times I thought &quot;Hey not to bad&quot;. This book actually was a bit catchy for an upcoming freshman (which is odd), and the message it delivered was one of value. I do not recomend this bok to any highschoolers really, because it will be a roaring bore, but if you are an adult and you like to read books that have some value to them (i.e Symbols motifs and all that garbage), then give this a try, but you will probably not like this book, but that is ok because it doesnt exactly keep you on the edge of your seat, but overall it was not bad at all.
630528069X|5.0|This was a fantastic action flick, but the deeper message cannot be ignored.  John McLane found himself among what everyone perceived as \\"terrorists.\\"  He quickly assumed a \\"cowboy\\" posture, even going so far as to adopt the name \\"Roy\\" (Rogers).  He then acted unilaterally against the terrorists, seeking to kill them whenever he could.  He did not seek to form a coalition, he did not crawl whining to the United Nations, he did not adhere to the principles of diversity, tolerance, inclusion and compassion -- he just got to work killing the terrorists.  The result he obtained was wiping out the terrorist threat because, if  this unilateral cowboy had not killed the terrorists, they would have killed him.  Shouldn't John have reached out to these fellow human beings?  Shouldn't he have sat in the corner doing yoga, asking himself \\"Why do they hate us?\\"  Shouldn't he have considered the culture from which they came, or their religious history?  Why did people enjoy this film so much, seeing a guy behave as John did, merely greasing a terrorist whenever he saw one and completely eliminating the terrorist threat?
0446530891|3.0|Amazon's advance billing for David Baldacci's newest book, Split Second, states that this &quot;new thriller [is] reminiscent of his phenomenal bestselling debut, Absolute Power.&quot; I loved Absolute Power and some of Baldacci's other novels so on my recent vacation, I gave Absolute Power a read. Certainly the story starts with a bang as Sean King, a secret service agent guarding the life of a presidential candidate, is momentarily distracted by an elevator door opening. Suddenly, King finds his protectee assassinated by a lone gunman. Who was the gunman? Why did he murder the candidate? And what (or who) could possibly distract a disciplined secret service agent at the peak of his career? <br />Fast forward eight years to another secret service agent, Michelle Maxwell, and another presidential candidate. This time the candidate is kidnaped, but no ransom is demanded. Is there a connection between the assassination and the kidnaping? King and Maxwell team up to try to solve the mystery. In the page burning mayhem that follows, one of King's old lovers shows up (another secret service agent), a potential girlfriend is murdered and (literally) hung out to dry, a witness protection person is murdered in King's office, and a former lover is kidnaped. Meanwhile King and Maxwell repeatedly narrowly escape their own murders.<br />With such a great plot set up, and given Baldacci's immense talent, I certainly expected Split Second to be &quot;pure, mind-numbing adrenaline to the last page&quot;. (Quote - Amazon) Unfortunately the last half of Split Second is simply mind-numbing. It's almost hard to believe that the same person who wrote the first half of the book also wrote the rest of the book. For one thing, in the set up Baldacci establishes a love triangle between King, Maxwell, and another former secret service agent, Joan Dillinger. This has the potential to take an already good plot and boost it right into orbit. How would King balance two potential lovers, protectall three of them, and at the same time solve the mystery? King's dilemma could have made for delicious drama. I am disappointed that Baldacci chose not to take his story too far down this path.<br />Another downfall of Split Second is closely related to the first. One of the love triumvirate mentioned above (I'll not mention who for the benefit of the gentle reader who chooses this book despite my mediocre recommendation) is kidnaped. Now wouldn't the reader expect that such an event would be a tragedy in his or her loved one's lives? Not according to Baldacci, evidently, who continues to write his other two characters' actions with little affect or affection. Wouldn't one remaining lover lament the loss? Wouldn't the other remaining lover take advantage of the opportunity? Wouldn't they at least think about this? We'll never know because Baldacci never tells us.<br />Finally, this novel fails in my mind because of the letdown conclusion of the book. Both of the above discouragements could have been rescued by the kind of incredible ending that has made Baldacci so widely acclaimed. Not so this time round. In fact, the only truly surprising aspect of the ending is that it's so domestic.<br />I've given Split Second a split decision with a 3 rating out of a possible 5. The story does move along at a good pace. Each chapter is short and advances the plot forward exactly one scene. In fact, the book almost reads more like a screen play than a novel. But I believe most readers will be disappointed in Baldacci's latest novel for its uneven storytelling. Unless you have an abundance of time and a shortage of books, I'd recommend a pass on Split Second.
B0000C0FJB|5.0|Rush are one of the most underrated bands of all time. There might be better musicians in the world, but try to find any trio or group somewhere that plays together as well as they do. I know some people don't like Geddy Lee's singing but it isn't that bad. He has improved with age and if you actually listen to the music you realize his vocals fit.On this new live album they are playing better than ever. I saw them on this tour and it was amazing.I didn't expect a bunch of guys approaching 50 to play this well, or pretty much blow away any other live concert i have heard.The audio quality is the best out of any of their other live cds. It has the best dynamics and you can hear every instrument clearly. A huge improvement over different stages. All the songs are given their definitive treatments. The crowd participation is great too, but never to loud.Alex lifeson keeps proving that he is one of the most underrated guitarists of all time.I have heard van halen,malmsteen,satriani,vai,petrucci,dimeola,mclaughlin,howe,and many others. He should definitely be mentioned with them. A very influential player. Geddy Lees bass playing is great and comes through fine. Most people know he is one of the greatest bassists along with john entwistle,chris squire,tony levin,billy sheehan.this album probably has neil pearts best recorded performance ever. Maybe because he knew it was their last show and put forth some extra energy. Not many drummers his age can say they are at their best but he is. Just listen to his new drum solo. very few players could compete with his use of odd times and polyrythms and sheer technique and skill. A true master of the drums and is still probably the most complete drummer today.I would recommend this live album to people who are just finding out about rush and to people who already have every cd by them.It is the highlight of their career.(so far)
0805047905|5.0|This is a classic.  Not sure why my almost two year old loves it so much but she does.  We like to use the colors on each page as a way to practice our Spanish (I have her tell me the color in Spanish).
B00005JLWN|3.0|Equilibrium shows the viewer a nightmarish future in which emotion is suppressed by drugs and incessant televised lectures from &quot;Father&quot;.  Anything that might induce an emotional response is prohibited (art, music, drama, and so on).  A totalitarian police force, the clerics, enforces this new world order by destroying prohibited material and executing those involved in emotional offenses.  This has all been done before.  One reviewer called it &quot;a thinking man's movie&quot;; the only thing I found to stimulate thought was the attempt to figure out which story a given plot element was being borrowed from.  Numerous candidates present themselves: Brave New World, Ayn Rand's Anthem, Fahrenheit 451, even a little bit of 1984.  The borrowing goes beyond plot - many of the visuals are very clear ripoffs of cinematic versions of the above and the Matrix.<br />Because of the degree of &quot;borrowing&quot;, the film's plot twists are predictable in the extreme.  The exception would be the happy ending which is incongrously tacked on to the end.  One suspects that the writer and director did not think the average viewer was prepared for the depression that dystopian visions can induce.<br />Despite all this, the film is at least moderately entertaining.  The various action sequences are all well done.  Bale and MacFadyen turn in performances that are better than one would think possible given what they have to work with.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|Matrix: Reloaded. Save your money. What a god-awful piece of crap. Discombobulated story, bad acting, bad script, very little story direction, even bad musical score. What a disappointment. We had stayed up late the evening before the premiere, after a longer than necessary week, just to see the first Matrix again to make sure we had the story details right. Unfortunately, it seems like the whole Lord of the Rings or Star Wars all over again. The first one(s), outstanding, the sequel financially successful on hype or anticipation alone, but falling flat as a story. When will Hollywood stop producing products based on popularity and go back to talent or substance? My only hope now is that every character will die in part three so they can't make another sequel.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I listen to all kinds of music from rock to rap to techno to blues to jazz to bluegrass to folk to hard rock/metal. I first heard the 9th song on the CD, The Nurse Who Loved Me. Who ever thought the rugs topography could be so beautiful? Heh, listen to the song, you'll know what I mean. Other than that, the album is a very melodic and rhythmic album. There are certainly &quot;hard-core&quot; bits and pieces that all seem to come at the right moment. This is not an album for the light hearted. It's about drugs, depression, death, life, rehab, sickness false dreams and losing one's own mind. But the delivery is one of a kind and shall not be missed. This is probably my favorite album right now. Just listen to it enough and you may appreciate it like I do, too.
0066214122|3.0|This novel was my first exposure to Michael Crichton. Though I had seen several of the movies based on his books, I had never read him before. The book was an extremely easy read; I devoured it in one day. I liked the conversational style of his writing and the vulnerability he portrayed in his Everyman hero, Jack Forman. The pacing was well-done and the urgency of the situation kept me engrossed. However, parts of the story seemed awkward and his writing seemed sloppy in places. The story was told in first person, but Jack gave information that he couldn't have known (since he wasn't in the room, etc. etc.). It seemed like Crichton was writing this one for a movie, since most of the flaws in the writing would not have mattered in the staging of a film. I thought this was an enjoyable thrill ride, but not a particularly impressive or creative piece of popular fiction.

0316666343|4.0|I found The Lovely Bones to be an interesting read. One would expect a story that starts with such tragedy to be depressing, but instead it ends up being a story of hope. The story comes as close to a happy ending as possible, given the premise.<br />I felt that the loose ends were tied up a bit too nicely at the end, though I was glad to read a story that wasn't all doom and gloom. It was a welcome change, since so many authors are opting for disturbing over satisfying these days.<br />Comparisons have been made between this book and Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird. I think that such comparison may be a bit generous, but the book does have a similar feel. I'm sure that is due in large part to the fact that it is told from the perspective of a young girl.<br />The element of this book that I thought was most masterfully done was growth that Susie experiences by watching her family. I also thought that the author's view of heaven was well done. It was believable and sufficiently vague, so as to avoid spouting some concrete notion of heaven that might have alienated some readers.<br />In the end, I recommend this book. It's a pretty easy read and it's an interesting new take on the traditional &quot;coming of age&quot; story.
B000002USN|4.0|This album was a wonderful work of art, except for it would have been a masterpiece if all of the duets were actually duets not dub-ins. Sinatra's voice sounds a little rough and aged at times but it's still sinatra. I would have to say it opened doors to listeners of other music genres. A few of the artists tried to make the songs there own (cough, cough luther vandross?) Anyway i give this album 4 stars because after all it was a multi-platinum album. The orchestrations are wonderful but it lacks any vocal chemistry, still a good taste of sinatra in the September of his years.
B0000019PA|5.0|I bought this album, even though I had been warned against it by my most trusted musical advisor, and had found it to be good but not really worh all the praise that it received from every critic.  So finally this god awful top 60 albums of the past ten years comes out and right at the top is Neutral Milk Hotel.  Of course the list also has some pretty average bands like Girls Against Boys and Polvo who really don't belong on any best of list even if it was for the year the album came out.  So I decide to give the album another try and to my surprise it was really amazing.  I don't know if it is the best album of the past ten years, but it is definitely a classic.  The album never lets up with it's songwriting as each individual song is really great and full of really fun melodies and his odd but very listenable voice.  Any fan of Elephant 6 bands like Of Montreal or early Apples in Stereo are really missing out if they don't have this record.  I'd recommend it to everyone, but alas it is an acquired taste I think.  The main complaint will probably be his voice. It isn't very accessible, but it really works for the music I think.  I would buy it or at least borrow it from a friend to listen to though.  You never know what kind of musical experience you may be missing out on.
B000063NPX|5.0|The legendary story of the Beauty and the Beast never looked better than on this lovely Disney animated feature. In a time (1991, after the Little Mermaid) when the classic Disney appeal had long passed (Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, etc.), the entertainment powerhouse for all ages came back with a film that resurrected the fairy tale story concept, giving it a much deserved technical make-up with animation that was up to the best of its time, in fact setting new standards for the genre. As an example, take the scene where Beauty and the Beast are in a dance hall and the virtual camera does a pan from the top of the room to the height of the characters: it has more depth (physical depth, I mean) than most if not all animated features I've seen.<br />As for music, it's tough to run into a contemporary animated flic with so many musical pieces so perfectly integrated into the story, and actually aiding it in a way that leaves you humming the songs for days at a time, after seeing the movie. The least that can be said about the role of music in the story is that the title song that won it an Oscar in 1991 is just a bit of what the music does for the movie: it moves you, makes you smile, and takes you in a thousand different directions.<br />As for a story and their characters, this movie has them all:<br />-The classic &quot;villain&quot; concept was beginning to evolve into more of a character getting in the way, but almost in a funny way, such as the case of Gaston in this movie. This concept would later become the norm in most Disney movies with soft &quot;villains&quot; that are not such, and at times with no villains at all.<br />-Hilarious big and small characters in disguise of teapots, chandeliers (Lumiere is my personal favorite, hands down!) and all sorts of furniture pieces.<br />-A Beast that can scare you with his initial anger or win your heart with the tenderness it exudes as his character evolves in the movie.<br />-Finally, a Beauty (Belle) that can be paired with some of the most beautiful animated characters, portraying a woman ahead of her time, wanting to read and travel in a stagnant peasant environment that would not relate to her 'crazy' dreams of exploration, much less coming from a woman whose place -in their minds- was &quot;back at home,&quot; raising kids, caring after her husband, etc.<br />All in all Beauty and the Beast is a storytelling, musical and animation accomplishment of sorts. It totally deserves all the praise.ith some of the most beautiful animated characters, portraying a woman ahead of her time, wanting to read and travel in a stagnant peasant environment that would not relate to her 'crazy' dreams of exploration, much less coming from a woman whose place -in their minds- was &quot;back at home,&quot; raising kids, caring after her husband, etc.<br />All in all Beauty and the Beast is a storytelling, musical and animation accomplishment of sorts.

B0000AXE8I|3.0|Ok, I rented this with some hesitancy.  This film was almost universally disliked by the critics, and many of my friends disliked it as well.  So... I waited until the DVD was released to see the film, and I am so glad that I did.<br />The good:  Even though it's been overdone, I will admit that I enjoyed the special effects fight scenes, at least at first.  They were very well-choreographed.  <br />Unlike most, I also liked the Zion scene.  I always wondered what everyone seemed to be fighting for in the first movie, and now I know.  <br />And, of course, who can forget Carrie Ann Moss and Hugo Weaving.  Great actors, do justice to their roles.  <br />Also as usualy, great cinematography.  Those folks do know how to use cameras.<br />The bad:  Overdone fight scenes.  After about the first hour, it started to get tedious.  <br />The Oracle.  <sigh>  One of the few scenes which should have been a bit longer.  <br />Lawrence Fishburn: emotes like a poorly trained Shakespearean actor. He's one of those who tried to make the 50th row in the house feel what he was feeling, but too bad there's only 25 rows in the house. <br />Jada Pinkett Smith, the Albino Twins, and Monica Belucci:  hope they get more play in the third installment, I actually think they can be good characters.<br />The ugly: Keanu Reeves.  The man has no emotional range whatsoever, making the emotionally-challenged lunkhead that is Neo the perfect role for him.  About the only good thing I can say about him is that he's easy on the eyes.  <br />Philosophy 101: Uhm, I felt like this flick was a lecture taught by a poorly trained doctorate candidate.  It was heavy-handed, sermonistic, and preachy.  At least the first film challenged the viewer to think; this one practically rammed it's philosophy down our throats.  <br />Story/plot: I'd say ugly, except that would imply that there was one, which there wasn't. <br />The fight scene with the 100s of Smiths: It was drawn out, poorly done, and bordered on being a parody of itself.<br />Sadly, this film doesn't even have the excuse of being a guilty pleasure or a popcorn flick.  This, along with Mr. Lucas' recent work with the Star Wars franchise shows just how far filmgoers will go to make a buck or two without concern for quality.  If you want good, quality, modern sci-fi, check out the X-Men series or LOTR examples of how good film should be made.
B0000C9V3T|3.0|Great content, but you can't play it on your PC.  Copy protection prevents this from being played on anything but plain old CD player.  Seems pretty lame...  It'd be nice to have that on the label.<br />Don't buy it unless your OK with the CP...<br />Regards
B000005DQR|5.0|I first learned of DJ Shadow after hunting down the single used in the film Dark Days.  Having heard it in the movie it really set the tone.  I next encountered DJ Shadow in the movie Scratch.  This is a guy who loves music, loves vinyl and know how to eek something else from layering samples together to create something new.<br />Like all good artists, he weaves them into a tapestry rather than just putting together a bunch of samples to a beat.  There are so many different styles of music and spoken word that it is difficult to categorize.  <br />I find myself brooding and contemplating and easing into a comfortable melancholy while listening to this.  He has something to say and he has found a way of saying it that is truly spectacular.  Endtroducing should give some credibility to those who deem such sampling as lacking creativity.  Awesome.

B000002B1M|5.0|I wouldn't say that this album is on the same level as \\"Illmatic\\", but it's really close. Every song on here is tight, and there are a bunch that are on the Illmatic level (The Message, Street Dreams, I Gave You Power, Watch Dem Niggas, Suspect, Live Nigga Rap, & If I Ruled The World). This is classic Nas material he's still the street poet he was on Illmatic, not as raw, but now he's older & wiser. The production on the songs I mentioned are just as good, if not better, than on Illmatic. And lyrically Nas has grown, but it seems like he's not at his best on some of the tracks. Bottom line, this is a classic Nas album, if you liked Illmatic you should cop this, also check out another one of his classics, \\"Stillmatic\\".

B0000AZAUM|5.0|From the opening of \\"Five Years\\" with the drum beat slicing through the air to the contrapuntal closing chorus of \\"Rock and Roll Suicide,\\" this Surround Sound SACD mix is the nazz.  Ziggy's voice on \\"Moonage Daydream\\" actually echoes.  This is a great album that I think is even better in surround.  Perhaps the lyrics from \\"Starman\\" sum it up best:  \\"Then the loud sound did seem to fade/Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase/That weren't no DJ that was hazy cosmic jive.\\"
B000002HMH|4.0|Ok, here is how I see it, metallica was experimenting with this one, if you like the black album, but not their older stuff, you may like Load and Reload, though alot of there old fans dislike the change in their style, I like it. I can't get enough Hero Of The Day and Bleeding Me, not to mention the awsome Until It Sleeps, Don't get the idea that it's better than the black album. Even the people I know who hate Metallica admit liking The Black Album.
1878424319|5.0|This book is life-changing especially the agreement about not taking anything personally. This had never even occurred to me before. Even in my mid-thirties I have always lived my life based on what others say or don't say. I never knew I had the option of not taking anything personally. It transformed my life the moment I read it i.e. 'got it' and my life has never been the same since. It is an enlightenment. Thank you Miguel Ruiz for writing such brilliant things.
B00009RDG9|4.0|Don't get me wrong the Hunted isn't a great movie. If the Fugitive wasn't made, I doubt this move would exist. Tommy Lee Jones isn't playing Sam Gerard but it feels like he is. Except the guy he's after in this isn't innocent, he's a brutal cold blooded killer. He trained him to kill and now he went nuts and can't stop killing. Now he's the only person that can stop him. That's the plot student vs teacher. When they aren't having brutal fights, Tommy Lee Jones is tracking him down in the woods, sewers, old gf's houses and down busy streets. It's all fun though and it's nice seeing Tommy Lee Jones chasing a guy that's actually dengerous for once.  Benicio Del Toro is scary as the guy he trained and that lost his grip on reality. Despite not playing characters that are developed that great, Lee Jones and Del Toro play them well. Their fight scenes are well done and possibly the most brutal fight scenes seen on film in awhile. They make this film worth watching.

B00005JKN9|3.0|This is a short review, simply to say that the DVD is terrible! *Why is it over two discs, when it could easily be put on a single disc? Because the designers for the DVD printing spread the special features across the two discs. In actuality, they should have had a separate disc altogether for special features...**Also, the way that the film was split is very awkward - disc two actually begins with a sex scene involving 3 girls and Bill the Butcher. I would think it more appropriate to cut to the scene which immediately proceeds it. That way, a better opening would occur (if it has to be on 2 discs that is). ..***Finally, the features are terribly boring, and very repetitive. It seems all special features are going this way nowadays. Whatever happened to the fascinating commentaries which were SCENE SPECIFIC, not just a collection of random comments. For eg. Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers commentary. Anyway - judge for youself.
B000089CJI|1.0|The beats are ok, but dated already... the lyrics are sappy and bad. Good for the high school crowd though who have heard nothing better.  Melodies are pretty poor.<BR>To the reviewer who said &quot;Shoot me in the head if I ever find better music than this, please. &quot;<BR> You need to seriously expand your horizons. I could name about 50 bands that are eons beyond this stuff. You can start with My Bloody Valentine.
B000002LRX|5.0|This band has eaten away my mind for 14 years and I love every moment of it. With Faith No More you get nailed by creativity and are thrown aloof from the caterwalling of bands that simply clone themsleves around set genres and scenes. Most people can barely hang with such inattentiveness to convention. Faith No More set a million diffrent fires in alot of very diffrent people and catapulted creativity in music. <br />Angel Dust is a trip into a shade of Mike Pattons other band at the time; 'Mr. Bungle' by having some more twisted elements then The Real Thing(another true gem).

B0000CAXIC|4.0|I'll be honest. I was shocked the first time I listened to &quot;Colour and The Shape&quot;. I was expecting drums, heavy guitars, and Dave Grohl screaming. That wasn't the case. Unfortunately to me, the album seems very radio friendly, and the songs kind of all sound the same. I guess I was expecting more. But it really isn't that bad:<br />Good Tunes:<BR>&quot;Walking After You&quot; <BR>&quot;Up In Arms&quot;<BR>&quot;My Hero&quot; - I've heard this song before...somewhere<BR>&quot;See You&quot;

0446530891|5.0|I bought this book on a Friday night and became so captivated by the story that I ended up devoting every spare second of my weekend to it. By Sunday night, it was history and I hadn't had very much sleep in between the things I had to do over the weekend and the one thing that I found myself unexpectedly wanting to do - which was to get back to Split Second to find out what would come next.    Split Seconds starts out by describing two seemingly unrelated security breaches for protectees of the U.S. Secret Service. The incidents are set eight years apart and on the surface, the only common ground that they seem to share is the fact that both involved the Secret Service and in each case, an agent was individually blamed for what went wrong. Yet, there is so much more to Split Second. There is a highly complex connection between the two events and that is the suspense and delight of the story.    David Baldacci has woven a wonderful plot through Spilt Second that kept me on the edge of my seat. It is well written and very well paced. Despite the complexity of the story, Baldacci's writing style and clear explanations made it an easy and enjoyable read.    In Secret Service agents, Sean King and Michelle Maxwell, Baldacci has cast two extremely well developed characters. These are two that I would like to see continued in a subsequent story.    Kudos for Baldacci's latest! An exciting ride of suspenseful moments that kept me glued to the book from start to finish.    Highly recommended!    Daniel J. Maloney  Saint Paul, Minnesota USA

0385504209|4.0|I am so glad I read this book even though I almost didn't based on the reviews I saw posted on this site. As usual, there are always those who get excited about the inaccuracy of certain facts or believers who are afraid of other ideas... Is it an attack on the Church? No, it's not. It's a work of fiction, folks! Lighten up! Only an open mind can access to the next level. Unfortunately, this world has its share of frightened and close-minded christians.<br />The puzzle itself is a bit weak but the story line is entertaining. Light reading for those nights when there is too much reality TV. Don't be put off by these reviews - pick it up for what it is - a few nights of fun! Enjoy!
B0000AXE8I|2.0|Being a big fan of the first Matrix movie, I was extremely excited to see the second installment. I left the the theatre with an entirely different opinion.<br />The entire film played out like a video game. Neo was no longer the confused but determined protagonist of the first movie, but simply a hollow action figure fighting his way from scene to scene. Granted, these fight scenes were impressive, but whatever happened to the story? We were forced to sit through hours of explosions, presented with some philosophical musings, and then left to dangle for several months until 'Revolutions' is released.<br />I felt as if this movie was lacking something special. It focused way too much on Neo's fighting, and not enough on what he was fighting for.<br />I give this movie two stars because of one truly touching scene in this movie. Neo is presented with a gift from one one of the orphans - a dirty, tattered looking spoon, which we can only assume is from the 'there is no spoon' kid from the first movie. More moments like this may have turned off a lot of hardcore action fans, but would have made this film a lot more enjoyable.
B00005JM4Z|1.0|This movie definitely has its place among the worst movies I've ever seen. The first movie was acceptable; Even though there were a number of stupid scenes, the plot held itself more or less coherent to the end. The second one had absolutely nothing going for it. The plot was so simple and uninteresting that one had to wonder why the movie lasted for over an hour. The scenes were grotesquely horrible; Not even the race scenes were interesting enough to hold my attention. The portrayal of dumb DEA agents did not even elicit a chuckle. The dialogues were so awkward and consisted of extremely short sentences. I could think of three possible reasons for those terrible dialogues: 1) The actors were not capable of memorizing longer, more complicated sentences; 2) The budget was so low that the producers had to hire barely literate writers; Or 3) The intended audience was deemed capable of following only <BR>extremely simple conversations. <br />Oh, by the way, the cars, with the exception of the silver GTR (if it was a real GTR instead of a 4-cylinder, front-wheel-drive compact car clothed in a GTR-like plastic body), were not even impressive.
B000002J1Y|2.0|Okay - I've never been a fan of live recordings.  Seeing a band perform live can be Earth-shattering, listening to a live recording is only noisy.  I didn't do my research and didn't realize this was all live, or I would have never bought it.  I love the clean precision of Yes studio recordings, I don't want to hear cheers and whistles in the background.
068983571X|3.0|OK, the hype on this famous and classic book is huge.  I was expecting a nail biting, cliff hanging, edge of my seat read.  Instead, I figured out who the \\"bad person\\" was as soon as they were introduced.  And there was nothing scary about the book at all.  Sure, Holmes and Watson are very engaging characters and I enjoyed learning more about \\"the bad person\\" after all was said and done.  But, I just didn't find anything that special about the story.  Sorry!
B0000C1HLF|5.0|Okay, first of all, I just want to let all of you other reviewers know that I don't mean any offense by what I'm saying.       I love this movie because it's not complicated. Most movies now have incredibly long and annoyingly complicated plots. This movie requires very little brain activity. In other words, relax and have fun with it. The girls are cool, and the men are patheticly stupid. This is a girl's video, and if you have a problem with girls, I suggest you go watch football or some other men group show. This movie is terrific, so just relax, forget about the reviews, and have fun!

B00005JKN9|5.0|Shamefully overlooked in the Oscars, no one really wants to acknowledge that America was devised on the back of mass genocide, gang wars, thieves, crooked politicians all coupled with heavy doses of bitter bloody racism. Gangs of New York is all about that and then some more.<br />The film starts with an almost primordial scene as the different warring factions of a place in New York known as the \\"five points\\" come together to sort out their discrepancies using clubs, knives, swords, hatchets and claws. Its the \\"Native American\\" versus the \\"Irishman\\" or the \\"Native American\\" versus whoever else sets foot on their land. Bill the Butcher (a massively impressive, larger than life, Uncle Sam from Hell type character played by Daniel Day Lewis), leader of the Natives, wins the initial battle for the five points and soon enough the numerous other failed gangs have had to resign under his power. The leader of the Irishman is killed during the battle and his only son escapes, vowing revenge.<br />16 years later the son (Leonardo DiCaprio) is back to avenge his father by joining the natives to murder Bill the Butcher as an insider. By this stage the five points is starting to look more like New York and there are plenty of set pieces along the way including the abolishment of slavery marches, warlords feuding, gangs causing trouble in various ways, fire brigades battling each other, corrupt politicians trying to win votes, P.T.Barnum and his shows and DiCaprio's love interest (Cameroon Diaz playing... Cameroon Diaz) caught between two and even more men.<br />Historically you will love it, however the film does fail in that the premise is pretty much just your average revenge story with a whole load of \\"other\\" factual historical stuff on the outside, but it moves along at a cracking good pace and the screen time is mostly devoted to Daniel Day Lewis (wise choice from Scorsese - DeNiro is hardly missed at all!), who is an absolute powerhouse and it is his character alone that makes this movie worth its weight it Gold. For all its misgivings the movie still screams past most other historical dramas. Sure it is a little light on plot, but come on - its like the antichrist just directed his version of \\"Titanic\\" on a really bad acid trip. It is thoroughly outrageous stuff indeed. What did you expect - Oliver Twist?makes this movie worth its weight it Gold. For all its misgivings the movie still screams past most other historical dramas.

0812550706|4.0|This is a great book about a young boy named Ender Wiggin.  He is a member of a family that has three children and he happens to be the third.  He is looked down upon because he is the third and a family should only have two children.  He goes to a battle school and everything unfolds from there.  It is a book full of excitement.  It was very hard to put this book down.  I am very glad that I read it.
B00008EY9G|2.0|The first hour or so of this film is fantastic. The setup is simple. Different people get caught up in a flash storm only to end up in a motel where they start getting bumped off one by one. The story is very interesting, fast, with lots and lots of plot twists along the way but it all falls to pieces in the end with what the filmmakers probably thought was a unique and original twist-type-premise for the whole film. It sadly is not and even the final scene is like something out of Scream VII.<br />Watch &quot;Brazil&quot; or &quot;Jacobs Ladder&quot; instead to see how they got this kind of a plot twist right.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|The storyline is a little more thrilling, but it is very confusing at the end.  I thought it was a little too predictable, but still awesome.

B00005JMEW|5.0|It worth to wait for many years.  Mr. Tarantino never disappointed his fans.  I am in luck that I can see the \\"more violent\\" version in Hong Kong (where the Crazy 88 Fighting scene is in color).  First, I appreciate Mr. T's admiration to HK movies, especially the Kung Fu oldies.  Much of the fighting scenes - though handled by Yuen Wo Ping - are different from the wired scenes like those in Charlie's Angel or Matrix.  I would like to say that, believe it or not, the body cutting action is very very common in the 70's in HK's martial arts movie.  In one famous movie, the hero even carried his intestine hanging outside his torn abdomen.  Ridiculous?  No.  On TV screen, we once saw a sword fighter to cut half vertically an enemy.  Violent?  You've only seen little in Kill Bill.<BR>Also, the storyline is quite a common revenge story in Chinese martial art story.  So common that what this story still shines is Mr. T's superb story telling ability.  I am sure that no other director can present such a standard story in such a stylish way.  This is a cult/classic example how movie can bring magic to us.

B000006TRV|5.0|Unlike any other rock production, 'The Wall' stands alone at the pinnacle of genius songwriting.  A little heavy perhaps for those not familiar with the story or PF, but once understood, there is no substitute.  Even PF themselves could not top this work, so don't expect anyone else to.  For variations on some of this material, also watch the film and taken in 'live' performances available.  All in all, a fine piece of music.
B00008J4P5|5.0|This album is a masterpiece.  Simple, beautiful rock and roll like just like God intended it.  Folky, bluesy, kick your arse, punkish, super-creative.  Tasty!  Something for everybody in here.  Some of the greatest songwriting of the decade.  Not the most original chord progressions but recycling saves the environment!  I think people only compare it to Led Zeppelin and Beatles because there aren't many other bands that have that crisp level of emotion.  Thank you Jack and Meg for saving Rock and Roll from the industrial music crap factory!
B0000B1OE7|4.0|This new edition of NINJA SCROLL was presented in ANARMOPHIC WIDESCREEN for the first time . I like the picture quality . It was improve over the previous version .

You can feel the impact &amp; the surround effect during the action scene .<br />On the new track , both the ENGLISH &amp; JAPANESE DTS-6.1ES are mix in a very low level .

0385121679|5.0|I was reading The Amityville Horror when I was a junior in high school.  My mom was reading The Shining.  I said to her, \\"this book is so scary.\\"  She replied, \\"wait until you read this one.\\"  I have been one of Mr. King's patient readers ever since.<br />I remember walking through the halls of school with this book in my face.  I stayed up way into the night to finish this one.  I heard every floor creak that wasn't there.  The first few chapters take a while to get through.  Once you get to \\"The Overlook,\\" the fun begins.  Dick Halloran was one of the most noble characters in literature.  Jack Torrence shows us that at the end of the day, parental love triumphs over evil. I love, love, love this book.<br />After I read The Shining, I couldn't wait for the next product of Mr. King's fabulously warped gray matter to spew forth.  I read every Stephen King book I could get my hands on.  The Shining is and will always be my favorite.  Everytime I pick it up to reread, I find a little something that I didn't catch the first few times.  <br />I was so excited when I heard they were making a movie of my beloved Shining.  I went to see it opening day.  Was this the same story I read? Did Kubrick even read the book?  There was a made for TV movie with Stephen Webber that was much better.  Any time I hear someone say that they loved the movie, I ask them if they read the book.  The answer is usually no.  I think anyone who is a fan of the book may agree with me about the movie.  The Shawshank Redemption and Stand By me are much better movie representations of Mr. King's work.  How exciting when anyone says they are great movies to tell them that they began as short stories from our creepy hero.<br />For a good hair-standing-up-on-the-back-of-your-neck read, this book is it.
B0000039LE|3.0|Considering the cult following and numerous sequels this movie has spawned, I expected it to be one of the most frightening films ever. Maybe my expectations were too high, but it seemed  as dull as cold soup. I didn't even find this funny in a Plan 9 from Outer Space way.<br />It's true that this film is not very bloody, considering the subject matter, but that's not the source of its unrelenting dullness; Psycho, one of the most involving films ever, is even less gory.<br />I'll cut it some slack, and note that if you have no advance warning, there are a few startling moments. Also, as this was an early film in the \\"slasher\\" genre, it probably was much more shocking to its original audience.<br />Jamie Lee Curtis, I should note, does turn out an engaging and credible performance that is worth seeing.<br />I'm surprised Donald Pleasence chose to make this film. Jamie Lee Curtis was not a high-draw name at the time, and probably happy just to have work, but Pleasence was already famous, and has no excuse. His massive talent isn't really apparent here.<br />This is a low-budget garage movie, that doesn't come across as much more; I still recommend seeing it, just because it is admittedly a seminal work. It's also fun to play trivial pursuit, catching all the references to earlier horror flicks. But don't go in with high hopes of being scared out of your pants.

B00005MP58|4.0|I've lost count of how many times I've read Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen - it's one of my very favorite books. Comparing the two miniseries adaptations of it -- the more recent one by A&E/BBC and the one done in the 80s by BBC ([[ASIN:B000244FDW Pride and Prejudice (BBC, 1980)]]) -- there are definite advantages to each. The one you choose depends on what you want. If you want a really good and fun modern romantic comedy, watch the A&E version. But if you want what is closest to Austen's novel (which I prefer), watch the older version. The first time I tried to watch the newer version, I turned it off after the first 30 minutes because I kept saying, \\"THAT didn't happen in the book\\" over and over again and it was really frustrating me. I finally forced myself to keep watching it with my mom there to be able to vent to as needed (she's also a huge fan of P&P and of the Rintoul version), and got through it OK and then wrote this review afterwards.<br /><br />POSITIVES OF THE A&E VERSION:<br /><br />1) It is a visual feast: The costumes, sets and scenery are exquisite and make this version worth watching for that reason alone. They obviously had a larger budget than the 80s version, which is done in the old BBC 'stage play' style.<br /><br />2) Since this version is 75 minutes longer than the BBC version, you get to enjoy that much more of Austen's incomparable dialogue - the best ever written in the English language besides Shakespeare, in my opinion!<br /><br />3) In the interplays between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, their emotions are much more pronounced and open than in the BBC version... which makes their relationship more openly romantic even than in the novel. This is developed further by some scenes of them individually that weren't in the novel. In the 80s version and the novel, many of the subtleties of their relationship and feelings are left to the imagination. The A&E version is more in the unsubtle style of a typical modern romantic movie, which gives a wonderful new dimension to the story. The \\"unexpected proposal\\" scene is absolutely perfect; I think Austen would have loved it!<br /><br />4) Casting Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy. Although not as strikingly handsome as David Rintoul's Darcy in the 80s version (in the book, Darcy is far handsomer than Bingley), Firth adds the right amount of visible emotion to the character which David R. did not, while also maintaining a very aristocratic, refined air about him.<br /><br />POSITIVES OF THE 80s BBC VERSION:<br /><br />1) It is much more faithful to the historical setting of the novel. It captures much more accurately the slow-moving, thoughtful, refined, restrained, purist, obsessed-with-manners (but still quite amusing) aristocratic society of 18th century England. This to me gives not only a needed believability to, but also a much deeper understanding of, the characters and story. Austen's novels were very realistic and true to their time and place, so if you want the genuine Austen feel rather than the 'in-your-face' Hollywood style, see the 80s version (or just stick to the book). The A&E version comes across as being 20th century American, just cloaked in 18th century England costumes and sets. (For example, Bingley's two supposedly high class sisters slouch around, make faces and giggle audibly behind people's backs. Everyone seems to be constantly running, skipping or galloping somewhere. The less-than-savory characters, like Mary, Lydia, Kitty, and Mr. Wickham, look and act like they are from a much lower social class, in ways that go below what would have been acceptable in their class. A visitor to the Bennett home accidentally sees one of the sisters in her undergarments. When E. visits Pemberley, she sees Mr. D. coming from a dip in a pond with a wet undershirt on, rather than just having arrived in a carriage as in the book.) Some people have praised this aspect of it, saying that the BBC version is boring by comparison. But I believe that Austen's intent was that the interest in her novels would lie with her detailed character studies and intricate relational plots. That's what made her books so interesting, without all the action-packed gallivanting around and crassness which Hollywood seems to think is a necessity to entertainment. The BBC version recognizes this and retains a historical elegance and dignity; the A&E version does not.<br /><br />2) The casting is better. In the BBC version, each actor is completely natural and believable in his or her role. In the A&E version, much of the casting does not seem to fit the characters. Elizabeth comes across as being about twenty years older than she is, with a constantly knowing look as if she's already married with children. Mrs. Bennett seems too intelligent to be so silly. Charlotte seems snobby rather than humble. Miss Bingley seems cold and sharp rather than sweetly slimy. Mr. Collins is like a cartoon and not a believable person. The five Bennett sisters don't look at all like they could be related to each other. The actors seemed quite competent, just not cast in the right roles, and maybe directed to overplay them. The only one that was spot on was Colin Firth as Darcy. His was the only portrayal that I could totally believe to be a real person in 18th century England.<br /><br />3) The BBC version gives the same attention to each character that Austen's novel does. In the A&E version, only the principal characters are focused on, with the result that many of the characters whom we should have gotten to know better seemed to just be cardboard props, and their relationships with each other don't come across as being as intimate and familiar as they really are in the novel. For example, Elizabeth had a much deeper relationship with both her father and with her Aunt Gardiner than the A&E version portrayed, because it left out some key scenes between those characters. The only ones I could perceive as being really close in the A&E version were Elizabeth and Jane - and in the last half, Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. This is a great loss, because Austen's novels are all about the relationships between people, and each of their interesting personality quirks. They are character studies -- not just of the main characters, but of ALL the characters.<br /><br />Sorry for the length, but P&P is a special book and I wanted to share my full views on these adaptations for anyone trying to decide between them!<br /><br />BUT AS ALWAYS, it's a good idea to 1) read the negative reviews as well as the positive, since they are wildly different from each other, and 2) RENT before you buy!nt was that the interest in her novels would lie with her detailed character studies and intricate relational plots.

0425188809|3.0|A government experiment goes wrong: two animals escape from a laboratory. One is a highly, almost humanly intelligent golden retriever, with the usual dog sweetness and companionship; the other escapee is something like the experiments in \\"The island of Dr. Moreau\\", with a dark deathwish and incredible hate towards the intelligent dog. This monster is also very mentaly capable, and will stop to nothing until he finds his prey. Between them, two solitary people, a man and a woman, will come togheter, and their lives will change forever.<br />This is the a summary of Dean Koontz's \\"Watchers\\". I have only recently discovered this author's books, and \\"Watchers\\" is the second one I read from him, after the very enjoyable \\"Lightning\\". Based on Amazon.com reviews and on \\"Lightning\\", I was eagerly waiting to read \\"Watchers\\", but the final result came shorter from what I was expecting.<br />Although the plot is neither original nor too much believable, it could be very fun, because this is a work of fiction. If I  wanted reality, I would read Stephen Ambrose - a very good author. But the way Koontz treated his book was not very interesting. The main human characters are too much alike. Other characters enter and exit the book much too fast, and when they were part of the plot, I couldn't relate to them, because of their shallowness. The contract killer, the NSA cops, the lawyer, all were uninteresting and yet important - and boring - parts in the book. This was an error. The intelligent dog, Einstein, is the best thing in the story. But there is a huge mistake in its conception. Without wanting to give anything away, if the scientists were able to work the dog's genoma and make him intelligent, why the hell weren't they able to prevent it to suffer from such a common dog's disease like cinomosis??<br />This is what I'm talking about. Koontz imagined a story with a high potential to be awesome, and then treated it with carelessness. And the monster, also another part of the story with good potential, only appeared when a killing was scheduled. I couldn't even dislike the monster, because, apart from the killings, it didn't do anything hateful, and his motivations never showed up.<br />I know I'll be thrashed by Koontz fans, but that's my opinion: this book could be much better.<br />Grade 6.0/10story with good potential, only appeared when a killing was scheduled.

B00004WG2X|5.0|I've lost count of how many times I've read Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen - it's one of my very favorite books. Comparing the two miniseries adaptations of it -- this one done in the 80s by BBC and the more recent one by A&E/BBC ([[ASIN:B00005MP58 Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E, 1996)]]) -- there are definite advantages to each. The one you choose depends on what you want. If you want a Hollywood-style romantic comedy, watch the A&E version. But if you want what is closest to Austen's novel (which I prefer, and enjoyed more), watch the older BBC version. The first time I tried to watch the newer version, I turned it off after the first 30 minutes because I kept saying, \\"THAT didn't happen in the book\\" over and over again and it was really frustrating me. I finally forced myself to keep watching it with my mom there to be able to vent to as needed (she's also a huge fan of P&P and of the Rintoul version), and got through it OK and then wrote this review afterwards.<br /><br />POSITIVES OF THE A&E VERSION:<br /><br />1) It is a visual feast: The costumes, sets and scenery are exquisite and make that version worth watching for that reason alone. They obviously had a larger budget than the 80s version, which is done in the old BBC 'stage play' style.<br /><br />2) Since that version is 75 minutes longer than the BBC version, you get to enjoy that much more of Austen's incomparable dialogue - the best ever written in the English language besides Shakespeare, in my opinion!<br /><br />3) In the interplays between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, their emotions are much more pronounced and open than in the BBC version... which makes their relationship more openly romantic even than in the novel. This is developed further by some scenes of them individually that weren't in the novel. In the 80s version and the novel, many of the subtleties of their relationship and feelings are left to the imagination. The A&E version is more in the unsubtle style of a typical modern romantic movie, which gives a wonderful new dimension to the story. The \\"unexpected proposal\\" scene is absolutely perfect; I think Austen would have loved it!<br /><br />4) Casting Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy. Although not as strikingly handsome as David Rintoul's Darcy in the 80s version (in the book, Darcy is far handsomer than Bingley), Firth adds more visible emotion to the character which David R. did not, while also maintaining a very aristocratic, refined air about him.<br /><br />POSITIVES OF THIS 80s BBC VERSION:<br /><br />1) It is much more faithful to the historical setting of the novel. It captures much more accurately the slow-moving, thoughtful, refined, restrained, purist, obsessed-with-manners (but still quite amusing) aristocratic society of 18th century England. This to me gives not only a needed believability to, but also a much deeper understanding of, the characters and story. Austen's novels were very realistic and true to their time and place, so if you want the genuine Austen feel rather than the 'in-your-face' Hollywood style, see the 80s version (or just stick to the book). The A&E version comes across as being 20th century American, just cloaked in 18th century England costumes and sets. Some people have praised this aspect of it, saying that the 80s version is boring by comparison. But I believe that Austen's intent was that the interest in her novels would lie with her detailed character studies and intricate relational plots. That's what made her books so interesting, without all the action-packed gallivanting around and crassness which Hollywood seems to think is a necessity to entertainment. The 80s version recognizes this and retains a historical elegance and dignity; the A&E version does not. (In the A&E version, Bingley's two supposedly high class sisters slouch around, make faces and giggle audibly behind people's backs. Everyone seems to be constantly running, skipping or galloping somewhere. The less-than-savory characters,like Mary, Lydia, Kitty, and Mr. Wickham, look and act like they are from a much lower social class, in ways that go below what would have been acceptable in their class. A visitor to the Bennett home accidentally sees one of the sisters in her undergarments. When Elizabeth visits Pemberley, she sees Mr. Darcy coming from a dip in a pond with a wet undershirt on, rather than just having arrived in a carriage as in the book.)<br /><br />2) The casting is better in the BBC version and each actor is completely natural and believable in his or her role. In the A&E version, much of the casting does not seem to fit the characters: Elizabeth comes across as being about twenty years older than she is (with a constantly knowing look as if she's already married with children), Mrs. Bennett seems too intelligent to be so silly, Charlotte seems snobby rather than humble, Miss Bingley seems cold and sharp rather than sweetly slimy, and Mr. Collins is like a cartoon and not a believable person. The actors seemed quite competent, just not cast in the right roles, and maybe directed to overplay them. The only exception, as I mentioned above, is Colin Firth as Darcy.<br /><br />3) The 80s BBC version gives the same attention to each character that Austen's novel does. In the A&E version, only the principal characters are focused on, with the result that many of the characters who we should have gotten to know better seemed to just be cardboard props, and their relationships with each other don't come across as being as intimate and familiar as they really are in the novel. For example, Elizabeth had a much deeper relationship with her father, her friend Charlotte and her Aunt Gardiner than the A&E version portrayed, because it left out some key scenes between those characters. The only ones I could perceive as being really close in the A&E version were Elizabeth and Jane - and in the last half, Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. This is a great loss, because Austen's novels are not just about romance, but about the relationships between people, and each of their interesting personality quirks. They are character studies -- not just of the main characters, but of ALL the characters.<br /><br />BUT AS ALWAYS, it's a good idea to 1) read the negative reviews as well as the positive, since they are wildly different from each other, and 2) RENT before you buy!like Mary, Lydia, Kitty, and Mr. Wickham, look and act like they are from a much lower social class, in ways that go below what would have been acceptable in their class.

0790731509|2.0|I have to admit Newman puts up excellent performance in Cool Hand Luke.  But the film is really quite boring and Luke just gets annoying after a while.  He annoys because he doesn't really want to escape prison and just wants to get caught.  Of course this just serves to emphasize his existentialist nature, but it ends up being silly to a skeptic like myself.
B000089RVR|5.0|Life for rent is another awesome album by Dido. It is a bit more laid back than &quot;No Angel&quot; but in my opinion, I think that makes it better. Her soft calming vocals really suit the music. Its just great to listen to it while your driving in your car or even while your sleeping or taking a nap. Highly recommended!! A must have album for both dido fans and non dido fans. Go buy one now! hehe.
B00005JKNF|4.0|This is an enjoyable film.  The first half is a bit boring as the large number of characters are introduced, and it took me a long time to understand who's who.  But if you are an Anglophile (I consider myself one) you'll enjoy the nicely recreated social atmosphere at the upper-class estate from 1932.  The story gets more interesting when the Weisman character announces he's making a murder mystery movie based on such a social occasion in the UK.  Of course then someone does get murdered.  Overall this is an enjoyable film if you can put up with the first half.  The acting is tremendous and I just love the British pomposity.
B0000AUHOH|3.0|Star Trek V ranks at or near the bottom of the Trek films for most fans and casual viewers. And upon viewing this on its special edition DVD, my opinion has not changed. This is a film that tries hard but ultimately fails due to poor plotting, sub-par special effects and poor character development.<br />The movie opens with probably the best scene in the film, where you meet Sybok and learn a little about his quest. The visuals alone in the opening shots are very impressive. Then, slowly, scene by scene, the movie falls apart. Yes, there are a few peaks in there, which I will discuss later, but overall, the idea of a &quot;God Like Being&quot; in the center of our galaxy, it just so illogical.<br />The movie has a lot of embarrassing and just plan bad moments. The first of which is the meeting of three characters who represent the &quot;Planet of Galactic Peace.&quot; However, their intro is rushed and these characters are not given any depth at all. Why introduce us to these &quot;important&quot; characters if they care not going to be used in any meaningful (maybe one of them at the end) plot point at all? The direction by William Shatner also seems very uneven. Take the scene with Scotty and Uhura on the bridge. There is a very awkward moment of silence after their main dialogue is over. And the mugging Shatner does when McCoy makes very awkward comments to Spock's story about Sybok is just out of place. And add to that a semi-naked Uhura and Scotty hitting his head for a &quot;Three Stooges&quot; laugh and you begin to sink in your chair. The Klingon plot seems tacked on just to add depth to the story. And by the time we see where the movie is going, we just feel very disappointed and underwhelmed.<br />That said, I can't help but enjoy the wealth of good character moments in the film. I for one liked the campfire scene and the attempts of deep philosophy about old age and death. I also liked exploring the &quot;pain&quot; of McCoy and Spock and Kirk's insistence that he &quot;needs his pain.&quot; While most of the humor was forced and bad, the best had to be the \\"I could use a shower\\" scene, which is one of the biggest laughs in all of the Trek films. There were many moments of good direction by Shatner, especially in McCoy's \\"pain scene.\\" I do sympathize with Shatner a little, when listening to the commentary track, about how this was cut and that was cut but I still think on a whole, this movie was doomed to fail.<br />The DVD's picture is sharp and the sound is excellent. The extras are quite good but I would have liked more insight as to what went wrong with the film besides tight schedule and budget. Shatner's commentary with his daughter is good but has too many quiet moments. Check out the hidden and brief \\"comic reel.\\"<br />At this point in time, I do rank Star Trek V above Nemesis, mainly due to that movie's bad continuity issues but just barely. Still, it is Star Trek and if you like the characters, just sit back, don't expect much and enjoy the show.e that he &quot;needs his pain.&quot; While most of the humor was forced and bad, the best had to be the \\"I could use a shower\\" scene, which is one of the biggest laughs in all of the Trek films.

Just a concert from start to finish as you would hear it if you were there.<br />I wonder if the audio set had a booklet incuded with it. Mine has none. Just 3 CD'S. Could another reviewer confirm if the Audio set has a booklet included?<br />Considering these guys had no soundcheck this night, they sound amazing. The crowd has to be the most energetic I have ever seen. How I wish I was there that night. Great job Neil, Geddy and Alex.<br />Worth every penny.<br />Thanks to yyz from Vancouver, Canada  for answering my question on the booklet in the cd. Mine came without one. I figured I just got a mistake missing the booklet. I will return for another . Thanks again.
B00008J2DQ|1.0|To all of you who rate Godsmack more than 1 star....I feel sorry for you because you don't realize you are being ripped off bigtime.  This is a band who took there name from a song by grunge band &quot;Alice in Chains&quot;.  Fine.  But it doesn't stop there.  They are not inspired by Chains...they are trying to be Chains.  The only problem is that there are no interesting guitar riffs, the singing blows, the music is boring and unimaginative and it is stunningly lame.  There used to be a time when a guitar player would inspire other beginnners to learn or to play.  Seriously, do you feel the guitasrist for Godsmack could inspire anyone to play?  It is a sacrilege. Do yourself a favor and go listen to &quot;Dirt&quot; and then tell me, in all honestly,  who has the more intersting melodies and riffs...Jerry Cantrell of ALice in Chains or the wannabe from Godsmack.  Abort this band immediately.

A definative document to the greatness of Rush, as demonstrated by a 3-hour show, performed with powerful conviction, in front of 40,000 blissed out and full-throated Brazilian Rush fans!!!  How these 50-somethings can pull off the intensity and flat-out Rock And Roll BRAUN on this CD is beyond me.  And this is the 67th show of the tour!  <BR>Rush have been around for over 30 years.  They've always catered to their fans and not to popular trends.  They've always worked extremely hard at keeping their music fresh and their chops sharp.  You simply cannot find any three more accomplished musicians/song writers in Rock.  No one thunders the atmosphere like Rush and the fans respond with 100% excitement and joy.  Excellent camera work (see DVD), excellent sound production, excellent light/visual show (see DVD), excellent performance and musicianship.  It doesn't get any better, folks.  Buy this CD and DVD and experience the power of RUSH.

0780627024|5.0|In a previous review, someone had mentioned that the second half of Pleasantville became a social/political attack on the 50's, which ruined the fantasy aspect that made the movie entertaining.  I would argue that the film is an accurate reflection of the &quot;Nostalgia Trap&quot; that we often fall prey to in modern society.  The movie is not criticizing the post-war life, it is deconstructing the myth that everything was simple, or black-and-white in the 50's.  The comments above are myths that we have developed over the last 50 years (about teen-pregnancy, marraige, etc.). (If you want to read more about these misconceptions and see the historical data, read: The Way We Never Were: American Families and the Nostalgia Trap by Stephanie Coontz.) My favorite part of Pleasantville is when the mom at the end of the movie is stood-up by her boyfriend, and she says to David, &quot;It wasn't supposed to be this way,&quot; and he replies, &quot;It's not supposed to be ANY way.&quot;  That is the moral I carried out of this film.
B0000C0FJB|5.0|Arguably the best live Rush album ever. Complete live versions of YYZ, Natural Science, La Vila Stangiato, and By-Tor and the Snow Dog. What more could you ask for? How bout scorching versions of One Little Victory, Driven, The Trees, Spirit of Radio, and Working Man. This is possibly the most complete live Rush album.

B00000G3PA|1.0|no good ideas, dumb plot, predictable, unintelligent and not entertaining at all.
B00005QB9A|1.0|~<BR>One very important point that neither supporters nor detractors of this movie have mentioned is that it seems to be a metaphor for cinema. <br />Mind you, it is easily missed, in fact, I can't say for certain it was even intended! But just below the surface lies a resigned nostalgia that suggests the \\"greatness\\" of cinema is a thing of the past. Like a big old rusted ship about to be consumed by an indifferent ocean, the film implies that cinema is washed-up; the brilliance and splendour it once had has gone, and now it can only aspire to repetitious cycles of dead-in-the-water entertainment's - one lumbering \\"Titanic\\" after another.<br />When one considers that Tornatore is the creator of that other over-blown \\"paean\\" to movies, CINEMA PARADISO, it isn't beyond the realm of possibility to assert that \\"cinema\\" could be one of his thematic preoccupations. The structure of THE LEGEND OF 1900 (particularly the early scenes) parallels the emergence of film, and given the year of production it's not too much of a stretch to see it as another \\"tribute\\" to (or comment on) the first 100 years of the medium. <br />There is a pivotal scene near the end of the film where Max (Pruitt Taylor Vince) searches for the character known as \\"1900\\" (Tim Roth) within the rusted bowels of the abandoned ship (the wreckage of cinema). 1900 has never been on dry land, and as the ship creaks and groans beneath them, Max hopes to convince him to leave the ship before it is destroyed. He describes the world beyond the vessel as a place of infinite choice, but 1900 replies that he can't abandon the only reality he has ever known. In his heart Max knows that 1900 could never accept the \\"sea of anonymity\\" (mediocrity) that life on dry land (modern commercial crowd-pleasing movies) promises. Having no place in this world, 1900 (the embodiment of \\"true\\" art) goes down with the ship (the discarded notion of cinematic art). Perhaps Tornatore is signalling his own intention to go down with it. Onthe evidence of this film, it's a loss I could live with. <br />So, did Tornatore intend THE LEGEND OF 1900 as a denunciation of big-budget commercial Euro-puddings, cleverly made in the vacuous style of its worst excesses (criticising the likes of James Cameron's equally wretched TITANIC by emulating it!), or has he simply made a vacuous film? If Tornatore does believe that the glory of cinema has gone, it's highly plausible that he made this film  as a sad celebration of its passing, a \\"wake\\" of sorts, trailing wistfully behind the phantom ship of the lost glory of movies. (Oh dear, I'm beginning to sound like him!)<br />But I fear I'm giving this slice of over-boiled ham more credit than it is due. It pains me to have to even give it one star. I whole-heartedly share Zachary Norwood's astonishment at how highly this film is regarded. That such a lame, manipulative commodity should elicit such impassioned approval crushes the spirit of those with more cinematic discernment (and hope for the medium). Where Zachary recommends films like LAST TANGO, I'd be more inclined to suggest anything by Alexander Sokurov, Bela Tarr, Michael Haneke, Theo Angelopoulos, Robert Bresson, Carl Dreyer, Sharunas Bartas, Zhang-ke Jai, Hou Hsiao-hsien, Tsai Ming-liang, Bruno Dumont, Gaspar Noe, Jacques Rivette, Jean-Marie Straub, Chantel Akerman, Claire Denis, Margarite Duras, or Jean-Luc Godard, a short list that barely skims the surface of the depth of cinematic choice available, and in relation to which something as gratuitous and banal as THE LEGEND OF 1900 pales into insignificance. (For lovers of Tim Roth, I suggest his remarkable directorial debut, THE WAR ZONE, or any of his English work as an actor, particularly MADE IN BRITAIN by the under-rated and extraordinary Alan Clarke.) <br />As a \\"fairy-tale for grownups\\", THE LEGEND OF 1900 flatters the laziest of viewers, which demeans grownups and fairy tales. As one character says, \\"You're never really done-for as long as you have agood story and someone to tell it to\\" - or did he mean to say, \\"someone to sell it to\\"?<BR>~

0790734850|5.0|Almost every character in the is film is corrupt. Reasons vary, of course, but there are the usual suspects: money, power, ego, greed, sex, ambition, and fear. This film probably launched Russell Crowe's career in the role of always cynical and sometimes dangerously violent Detective Bud White who has his own concept of justice just as Detective Harry Callahan does. White's partner, Detective Ed Exley (Guy Pearce), is far more calculating and self-serving, willing to advance his career at whatever cost. Detective Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) is their associate and to me, the most interesting character in the film. He maintains a high level of efficiency without ever placing himself in harm's way. He serves as technical advisor to a television series and has a payola deal with Sid Hudgeons (Danny DeVito): let him know whenever a celebrity is about to be arrested so that Hudgeons can obtain an on-site  photo exclusive for his tabloid, Hush Hush. Meanwhile, having fallen in love with Lynn Bracken (Kim Basinger) who bears a striking resemblance to Veronica Lake, White learns about a unique prostitution ring whose other members also resemble other film stars. (One awkward scene in the movie suggests that Lana Turner was unaware of the ring.) Separately, White and Exley eventually penetrate more deeply and more dangerously the corruption in Hollywood during the 1950s, corruption which includes the L.A.P.D. And then....<br /><br />This is a classic, in some respects \\"noir\\" police film, ably directed by Curtis Hanson. Some have compared it with The Big Sleep, Chinatown, and even Training Day but I think there are more differences than similarities between any them. Basinger received an Academy Award for best supporting actress and Hanson shared an Academy Award for best adapted screenplay (of James Ellroy's brilliant novel) with Brian Helgeland. Years from now, this film may have more historical than dramatic interest but, so far, it has held up well as first-rate entertainment for those such as I who enjoy this genre of film.for those such as I who enjoy this genre of film.

Get a JVC stereo and set your treble and bass to 10 or put on some Koss headphones and listen to the best stereo sounding rock band in the world.  2112 is a landmark cd for Rush and adds perfectly to anybody's cd collection.

0800141806|5.0|All of the praise which this film has received and continues to receive is well-deserved. After seeing it again recently, however, I now think that the film's social issues have become, in the minds of  many people, more important than its artistic issues whereas I see them as being of equal and inseparable importance.  With all due respect to all the male AIDS victims when this film was cast, none of them could have achieved what Tom Hanks did in the role of Andrew Beckett. I presume to suggest, therefore, that this is a work of art which addresses truly serious issues which include but are not limited to AIDS within our society.<br /><br />That said, the basic plot focuses on Beckett's wrongful termination by his law firm employer after its managing partner Charles Wheeler (Jason Robards, Jr.) and his senior associates learn that Beckett has AIDS. (He had not previously informed them.) He is represented in court by Joe Miller (Denzel Washington) who runs a highly-visible, high-volume firm which specializes in representation of individuals seeking damages such as those which result from automobile injuries. Miller is a homophobic when he first meets Beckett (who seeks him out) and declines to represent him. Later, he changes his mind for reasons which are best revealed in the film. All of the acting is first-rate. The film's dramatic impact is largely explained by the fact that Demme (with strong support by Hanks) was determined to treat an immensely complicated and sensitive situation with appropriate style, grace, taste, and respect. He and his associates succeeded.<br /><br />Hanks received and deserved an Academy Award for best actor. My own opinion is that Neil Young deserved the Academy Award for best song which was awarded to Bruce Springsteen. Better yet, they should have called it a tie. Both deserved it. Given all the copy cat and sappy \\"music\\" which is composed for most films, Young's \\"Philadelphia\\" and Springsteen's \\"Streets of Philadelphia\\"  are not only uniquely powerful but enduringly haunting. My favorite scene is the last one which allows extended emotional involvement of the audience. No dialogue. No theatrics. Given how Andy Beckett's personality and character are presented in the film, this is precisely the way he would want his story to end.werful but enduringly haunting.

B0000AXE8I|3.0|The first Matrix film did something wonderful. It raised itself above the Comic genre, to create something new. Unfortunately, I have the feeling that the directors fired all their guns at once. There is nothing new in Matrix Reloaded. And what is worse, it falls back to the level of a filmed comic. The dialogue is lousy. The acting is mediocre. The fight scenes are repetitive. And as for all those QUESTIONS!!!!<BR>There's nothing wrong with philosophy in films. The first Matrix incorporated it beautifully. But whereas in that film they SHOWED us, in Matrix Reloaded, they just TELL US ... and tell us ... and tell us. And yet, when it finally comes down to it, whenever there is a pertinent question, nobody knows the answer!!<br />This film was a major anti-climax. Obviously, the &quot;real&quot; world of Zion is also part of the matrix - a matrix within a matrix within a matrix ...<BR>Ultimately, I can see the whole trilogy ending with Neo waking up in the shower.<br />Hey guys, it was all a dream ...<br />Or was it ?????

These aren't sappy love ballads.  In fact, they sound kind of creepy, like a bad 70's acid trip.  \\"Windowpane\\" sounds like it could've been in the movie The Others.  Akerfeldt's vocals are soothing, but Lindgren plays some ominous guitar riffs.  In true Opeth style, the instrumental that concludes the track outweighs the lyrics.  The lyrics take center stage on \\"In My Time of Need\\", a song about contemplating suicide (at least I think so).  Its delivery is powerful and despondent.  There's more doom and gloom in \\"Death Whispered a Lullaby\\".  The more you listen, the more you see how the songs all come together.  Akerfeldt brings it down to a whisper on \\"Hope Leaves\\".  On the instrumental track \\"Ending Credits\\", the rhythm section displays their fondness for bands like Pink Floyd.  \\"Weakness\\" concludes our eerie journey, but leaves you with one question...is this really the lighter CD or was it Deliverance?<br />Bottom Line:<br />Damnation is loaded with beautiful vocal melodies, soothing acoustic guitars, and calming musical interludes.  All this from a death metal band!  Opeth break down musical stereotypes with this 360-degree musical venture.  Death metal fans may be disappointed, but fans of rock in general will be quite impressed.  Damnation is the light at the end of Deliverance's dark tunnel (or is it?).  Side by side these two discs are sheer rock brilliance.

B000002P2V|5.0|Unfortunately, we never got to experience the direction that the band was heading. However, regardless of the overly critical reviews of this masterpiece, this was an incredible statement to close the end of the '70's, by the greatest rock and roll band of all time.<br />Roger's singing was never stronger than on this album. He eptomized the anger and the poignance of Townshend's lyrics. One of the main things to realize is that this album came out at the height of the disco era. The playing is contemporary, including great synth parts that never take away from the shear power of the rock and roll this quartet put forth.<br />Townshend, in fact, made a highly revered statement about the state of popular music in the song &quot;Sister Disco&quot;. The late John Entwistle also composed a couple of his strongest efforts: &quot;Had Enough&quot;(sung with wonderful intensity by Daltrey, the highly ironic &quot;905&quot;(with it's Townshend-like symbolism and sarcasm, and a hugely overlooked effort, &quot;Trick Of The Light&quot;. Again, Daltrey delivers this one with incredible emotion and feeling.<br />The whole band shines on this release, even in the face of Townshend's clear statements on society and popular culture. Townshend's writing here is incendiary, and the rest of the band fall right in. This was certainly an amazing comeback after &quot;The Who By Numbers&quot;, which was certainly uneven at best.<br />This disc is a *must have* for anyone that is remotely interested in the band and it's advancement. There's no question to their maturing as a band and as the voice of a generation. It also should be a collector's item, with it's cover shot including drummer extraordinaire Keith Moon sitting in a chair that is labelled &quot;Not To Be Taken Away&quot;(this was the band's last album with Moon, due to his untimely death soon after). Additionally, the only tune on the disc that features sparce texture from the drummer, with noticeable absence of Moon's infamous hard-hitting flawless timekeeping, is ironically titled &quot;The Music Must Change&quot;. It is this tune in which Townshend makes his greatest statement of the state of humanity along with an unintentional foreshadowing of the loss of rock's probably most unique and influential drummer ever.<br />Don't miss this disc. It certainly is an incredible statement of where this band may have headed. The Who came to grips with their growing up and maturing, and seemed to be coming into a new direction with incredible potential, if only the band had survived as a whole. They were never the same after the death of Moon, and this disc, particularly with the amazing performance of the title track, is a fitting swansong. This band changed the face of rock and roll. Witness the culmination of their career.us hard-hitting flawless timekeeping, is ironically titled &quot;The Music Must Change&quot;.

630587493X|1.0|This is by far the worst movie I have ever had to watch.  It isn't even bad in a way that you can laugh at.  It seems like it takes a bicentennial to watch. It is slow, boring and seems to have absolutely no point.  Each stop along the way in this movie, Williams is trying to become real, and in the process finds out how to be real boring.  This movie should have been 30 minutes maybe, but they decided to take that material and streatch it out for what seemed like 5 hours!  I am still not sure that this movie, which takes place over 200 years was not filmed in real time, like the show '24'.  Do not see this movie under any circumstances.
B000056H25|4.0|Because of the subject matter, the life of Jesus Christ, of whom more blood and ink have been spilled than any other human being to have ever walked the Earth, no one film can really be called THE definitive telling of this story.  But George Stevens put six years of blood and sweat into making a film that would come awfully close to being just that--THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD.  In its time, this movie ranked as one of the most expensive ever made by a major Hollywood studio at $20 million.  In its original form, it also ranked as one of the longest as well, at four hours and twenty minutes.  It was also critically savaged and did only so-so at the box office, though it was far from a commercial flop.    Although it doesn't exactly stick to the letter of the Good Book, THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD still depicts the life of Jesus from his birth to his eventual crucifixtion and resurrection with remarkable accuracy.  Several scenes, including Jesus being baptized by John the Baptist, are among the most moving ever filmed.  Stevens, who co-wrote the massive tome of a script with James Lee Barrett and Carl Sandburg, filmed on location amongst the vast panorama of the Colorado River basin along the Utah/Arizona border as a stand-in for the actual Holy Land, a move for which critics seemed unable to slam him enough, but which I think worked anyway.  Three composers--Alfred Newman, Hugo Friedhofer, and Fred Steiner--are credited with the massive score, and the use of the \\"Hallelujah Chorus\\" from George Frideric Handel's great oratorio \\"Messiah\\" was a cagey choice on Stevens' part.    One aspect about GREATEST STORY that obviously continues to raise eyebrows and no shortage of ire to this very day is the fact that Stevens seemingly cast half of Hollywood's acting elite in what were primarily cameo roles.  This had been done before in films like THE LONGEST DAY and HOW THE WEST WAS WON, to name just two, and would be done again and again in the coming decades.  I think that Stevens' flaw was not that he cast so many Hollywood heavyweights, but that he placed a number of them into roles they probably weren't cut out for.  Max von Sydow had the ultimate acting challenge of portraying Jesus of Nazareth here; and given the weight and expectations of Western civilization being imposed on him, he came off extraordinarily well.  Charlton Heston, no stranger to Biblical epics he, also gave a tremendous performance as John the Baptist, one that one would expect from an actor of his stature.  Telly Savalas, years before \\"Kojak\\", gives a steely portrait of Pontius Pilate; and Donald Pleasance, many years before HALLOWEEN, makes a very convincing Dark Hermit (a.k.a. Satan).    In the other roles, Stevens' choice of casting ranges from interesting (Roddy McDowall, Sidney Poitier, Dorothy McGuire, David McCallum) to a bit questionable (Robert Blake, Sal Mineo, Pat Boone [though Boone's later conversion to Christian music makes his presence here far less jarring now than it did then]).  But even now, Stevens' casting of John Wayne as a Roman centurion during the Crucifixtion scene is hard to swallow.  It's hard to mistake Wayne's drawl with the one line he has (\\"Truly, this man was the son of God\\"), and just as hard not to crack a smile at the flat way he renders it.    Still, despite the occasional miscating, the extreme length, and the near-impossibility of getting it 100% correct for everyone, THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD is quite an achievement in cinematic history.  Without a whole arsenal of special effects to work with, but with an imposing reputation all his own, Stevens made a definitive Hollywood epic that perhaps needs to be re-examined--hopefully in the original state that it was released.
B00003CWTI|5.0|If you're interested in seeing this brilliant and riveting intertwining of lost and pained souls, then don't read most of the reviews here.<BR>The film has an awesomely disorienting scene toward the end that will be totally ruined for you by some of these reviews.
B000000OR9|5.0|After playing with Tygers of Pan Tang and Thin Lizzy, guitar virtuoso John Sykes got the gig of a lifetime.  In 1984 he joined a reformed Whitesnake line-up, a position he originally declined.  John did some guitar work on Whitesnake's Slide It In album in 1984.  Impressed by his work, Whitesnake made Sykes a full member and in 1987 released their self-titled album.  The album prominently displayed Sykes masterful guitar work on such tracks as \\"Still of the Night\\" and the re-worked \\"Here I Go Again\\".  Whitesnake found themselves with their most successful album to date.  There are conflicting reports as to Sykes departure from the group, he either left or was fired depending on what you read.  However, Geffen records were certainly a fan of John's work in Whitesnake.  So much so they offered him a record contract of his own.  With the help of Tony Franklin and Carmine Appice, Blue Murder was born in 1989.<br />Sykes performs double duty on their self-titled debut, handling guitars and vocals.  Both are pretty smooth on the albums opening track \\"Riot\\".  You can take the man out of Whitesnake but you can't take the Whitesnake out of the man.  That's evident on \\"Sex Child\\".  Sykes parallels the work he did on \\"Slide it In\\".  There's no sexual innuendo or metaphor here, Blue Murder cums right out it says it (that's not a misspelling!).  Sex child / we're gonna slip and slide / I'm gonna come inside / girl.  \\"Valley of the Kings\\" is an eight minute epic that displays all the member's strengths.  Appice sets the pace with a pounding drum beat and Franklin plays in sync with Sykes guitar work.  Sykes and company throw in a couple of blues-influenced tracks, among them is the acoustic lead \\"Jelly Roll\\".  \\"Ptolemy\\" is a nice blend of blues & metal.  \\"Out of Love\\" is the group obligatory power ballad.  Blue Murder's debut album wouldn't be complete without an eighties metal staple.  Nope, it's not a song about gypsies, it a song named after the group.  Blue Murder is the best track on the album.  It has that perfect metal sound which defined that era.<br />Bottom Line:<br />Whitesnake should be crying Blue Murder!  It's clear that John Sykes was influential in the success of the eighties version of Whitesnake.  Sykes took that talent and displayed it prominently with Blue Murder.  The album is loaded with guitar heavy, metal anthems as well as smooth blues tracks.  Sykes sounds a little like David Coverdale, but that doesn't take away from his vocal talents.  The songs are simple, memorable, and a blast to listen to.  It's too bad Blue Murder weren't more successful.  Definitely a must for eighties Whitesnake fans.  I won't even hold it against the group that they dressed like pirates on the back cover.st track on the album.

0783231032|1.0|This is the absolute worst movie I ever saw.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|This move is phenomenal; other reviewers are hitting on a lot of good points.  So I just want to point out some counter argument concepts. Remember the cartoon the Transformers, which came out about 15 years before the matrix.  The idea is somewhat the same in the Transformers: The Autobots and Decepticons are robots that rebelled against their creators when they developed more intelligent and emotion.  The Autobots' Matrix, which Optimus Prime holds, was the most powerful weapon in the universe.  The first Matrix was my favorite movie for a period of time.  It had some new fresh ideas, it was stylish, artsy, Gothic, and best action and visual movie at the time.  It has an atmosphere similar to another animation call \\"Aeon Flux\\" which came out 5-7 years before.  This was set in a hyper-techno organic future environment.  The Matrix Reload is almost just an extension of the first movie.  The mystique is gone.  The visual is still awesome and superior above other.  A lower budget film &quot;Equilibrium&quot; that came out a year ago is another Matrix action movie that actually feels more creditable and fresh.  I wish they didn't release the next Matrix until they had something revolutionary coming out like the first movie.  I guess it about feeding the mass pop culture and money.  I give this a five star, since it is magnificent on many levels that I didn't touch on, but you know what they are.

B00006SFBD|4.0|I'm not the biggest fan of death metal.  However, every now and then I listen to the genre if it offers something different.  I've been hearing a lot of talk lately about Opeth.  I've heard they're not your typical death metal band.  They add a lot of different elements in their music.  I even heard Opeth promoted as the next big thing.  This peaked my curiosity.  Does Opeth really offer something different?  Does Opeth live up to the &quot;hype&quot;?  Let's explore......<br />Right off the bat Opeth assaults their loyal death metal followers with a fury of pounding drums and mind numbing guitar riffs on &quot;Wreath&quot;.  Vocalist Mikael Akerfeldt's growling vocals evoke angst and fear in their delivery.  The long instrumentals between the verses, highlighted by Lindgren and Akerfeldt's intricate guitar work, bridge the gap between the changing tempos.  The band continues their brutality on the title track Deliverance, but not for too long.  Two minutes into the track the heavy guitars give way to an acoustic interlude which shows off Akerfeldt's melodic delivery.  Don't get too comfortable though.  This 13+ minute epic bounces back and forth in a musical battle between beauty and beast, sure to please any hard rock fan.<br />Opeth don't believe in wrapping things up in a nice, three minute package.  &quot;A Fair Judgment&quot; clocks in at  10+ minutes, and begins with a classically inspired piano piece.  The track is void of death metal elements, but is loaded with plenty of fluid guitar work and showcases Akerfedt at his melodic best.  The guitar solos toward the end are intense.  Inserted in the middle of the disc is a short acoustic break entitled, &quot;For Absent Friends&quot;, then its back to the death metal.  &quot;Master's Apprentice&quot; continues with a heavy delivery battling it out with a more smooth and progressive sound.  &quot;By the Pain I See in Others&quot; concludes the disc, and is the freakiest track of all.  The track is heavy and melodic with breaks of silence in between.  After the silence Opeth adds some psychedelic elements too strange to put into words.  You have to hear it for yourself.<br />Bottom Line:<br />Deliverance is a &quot;melting pot&quot; of metal mayhem.  Opeth combines death metal, melodic rock, 70's progressive rock, and everything else they could think of.  Yes, I even heard the kitchen sink!  There are only six tracks on the disc, but five of them are over 10 minutes long with plenty of guitar breaks that won't disappoint you.  The fretwork is astonishing in its complexity and precision.  If you're not a fan of death metal, the vocals take a bit to get used to.  It's all worth it when Akerfeldt changes to a more melodic delivery.  Opeth are truly a metal force to be reckoned with.  I can honesty say I have heard nothing like them.  So, does Opeth live up to the &quot;hype&quot;?  Hell Yeah!

B000059XUO|5.0|I hate love stories, all those yuppy Julia Roberts movies make me sick.  When my girlfriend asked me what love story I'd sit down and watch, the only thing that came to my mind is The Crow.  <br />Simply enough, anyone who doesn't like this movie is a dumbass.  It's the wierdest love story I've ever seen, blending fantasy-ish components, a crime drama, and a love story all into one sleek package complete with some of the most kewl music ever made.  And it all came from a comic book by J. O. Barr(I know, I have a copy of one of the original series back in the early 90s).  <br />One quick final note: I've not seen &quot;Salvation&quot;, but I can tell you that &quot;City of Angels&quot; is the most horrible sequel to a good movie I've ever seen.  I now don't trust the name (without the late Brandon Lee) enough to watch any more sequels at my expense.  When Salvation comes out on tv, I'll try to catch it.
B00005JLSE|2.0|Choppy and jarring best describe the transitions between &quot;reality&quot; and the production numbers. Renee Zellweger looked and acted like a concentration camp survivor while Catherine Z-Jones waist (post pregnancy?) was poorly disguised by the hourglass costumes, although her dancing was excellent and her songs solid. Richard Gere is the surprise standout with excellent songs and dance routines.<BR>  The un-morality tale seemed stilted and bizarre with little emotional depth. It continues jerkly along until the finale that is probably the worst song and dance number of the movie. The DVD is saved from even a worse rating (2 stars) by the solid and entertaining back up given by the supporting characters. Needless to say this title didn't make it in to my collection and unless you are a Broadway Jazz junky it shouldn't be in yours.
B00004NHCC|5.0|It is hard to find information about Jazz in today's world, so it is hard to know what is good, what is bad and what is... well, you know. THIS is better than good. This is Sarah Vaughn, one of the best voices in the history of singing, backed by the best band she ever worked with, featuring trumpeter Clifford Brown. I'd pay the purchase price just for &quot;Lullaby of Birdland&quot;, but fortunately there are 8 other awesome tracks here. This is one of those albums you can play all the way through over and over again. No jazz record collection should be without it.
B00008H2LB|2.0|This &quot;band&quot; is one of my least favored, to say the least. so, needless to say, i was reluctant to get this cd. i hated Hybrid Theory with a passion because everyone was brainwashed into believeing that this band was the future of music and that there has never been any music like that of Linkin Park's. This cd, however, wasnt as praised by cridics or fans as Hybrid Theory was. So, this cd wasnt too over-rated, yet this band is very over-rated in the fact that they are signed to a major reacord label. I will admit that this is an alright cd and if it were by someone other than this disgrace to music then i might listen to it more than i do now. The video for Somewhere I Belong is cool, and i must say that it is their best single to date....although all of their other singles blow dead dogs for quarters. All-in-all, this album isn't worthy of a full 15 dollers, but if your ever in a used cd store and if you find a copy of this in there for like 6 dollers, go ahead and pick it up....if you find it in like Best Buy or somethin in the next 5 years or so, buy it....these guys will need all the money they can get.
B00006IK1C|5.0|In the summer of 1990 while Iron Maiden was on a break from their highly successful \\"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son Tour\\", frontman Bruce Dickinson had the opportunity to record a solo track for the Nightmare on Elm Street 5 Soundtrack (\\"Bring Your Daughter to the Slaughter\\").  As a result of this recording, which was later revamped on Maiden's No Prayer for the Dying album, Dickinson was offered the opportunity to record a full-length album.  The result was Tattooed Millionaire, a straight up hard rock album that takes Bruce in a different direction.  It combines elements of Iron Maiden and mixes them with a pop-metal feel.<br /><br />The album opens with shades of Iron Maiden on \\"Son of a Gun\\".  The track starts with a soothing acoustic intro followed by blistering metal riffs.  That's about as close to Maiden as it gets.  The title-track is an infectious pop-metal rocker that, oddly enough, is mocking the genre.  It's a scathing attack at pop/glam bands like Motley Crue or Poison (not specifically them).  Dickinson pays homage to our fathers and grandfathers on \\"Born in '58.\\"  It's about a time where men took pride in their work, their country, and fought the good fight.  \\"Hell on Wheels\\" opens with a riff very similar to AC/DC's \\"Back in Black\\" or \\"Highway to Hell.\\"  You don't get anymore metal than that!  Now, what late eighties / early nineties album would be complete without a song with gypsy in the title?  Not this one!  \\"Gypsy Road\\" is a power ballad about, what else, living on the streets.<br /><br />Bruce whips out the metal clich&eacute; book on \\"Dive! Dive! Dive!\\"  Not only is the melody repetitive, but the song is infused with typical sexual innuendo.  Bruce uses clever submarine terminology here, but we all know it's about going down on a woman.  In case you miss it, Bruce exclaims, Dive! Dive! Dive! / No muff too tuff / We dive at five.  A cover of Mott the Hoople's \\"All the Young Dudes\\" doesn't stray too far from the original, but sounds fresher.  \\"Lickin' the Gun,\\" a tongue and cheek \\"shot\\" at politics, has a bluesy sound comparable to classic Aerosmith.  \\"Zulu Lulu\\" continues where 'Dive!' left off, and \\"No Lies\\" closes the album.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />Bruce Dickinson clearly set out to make a fun, straightforward, hard rock album.  Tattooed Millionaire is exactly that.  No deep meanings, no complicated arrangements, just pure, kick ass, rock!the Gun,\\" a tongue and cheek \\"shot\\" at politics, has a bluesy sound comparable to classic Aerosmith.  \\"Zulu Lulu\\" continues where 'Dive!' left off, and \\"No Lies\\" closes the album. <BR>  <BR>Bottom Line:  <BR>Bruce Dickinson clearly set out to make a fun, straightforward, hard rock album.

0385504209|5.0|This book challenges everything you have been taught your whole life about religion.  Not only entertaining and heart-pouding, this book really questions the core of the readers beliefs.  I can imagine that many extremely devout Christians will be upset at this book, but God gave us free will and the ability to question.  What is amazing is that I don't know what I think of my previous definition of God anymore.  I can feel the student in me getting excited about learning again.  This is a must read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I enjoy this new offering very much.  Perhaps you can buy the boring musak that DB's piers are<BR>shoveling (Hello Mr. John, Mr. Stewart, etc) or you can let Bowie<BR>give you something more challenging.  Saying Bowie is no longer an important artist is the most ridiculous, 1 star thing that could be said.  <br />As for this cd, Disco King is a great song, as is New Killer Star<BR>and several others on the disc.  Thank you David!  You do not need a cane so keep on doing what you are doing, and your TRUE fans will be there for you.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|&quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; tries to be a lot of things.  It tries to be more visually mind-blowing than &quot;The Matrix&quot;.  It also tries to ask more philosophical questions, show more of humanity in the world of the machines, and to introduce us to numerous entities in the real world and the Matrix.  In some ways, the film succeeds (the highway chase is an amazing set piece!) and in others it fails (the &quot;Burly Brawl&quot; ends up looking unreal because they went farther than the effects were really capable of).<br />Many people have dissected the plot, the effects, etc.  What it boils down to is this: &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; is a kick-arse sci-fi kung-fu flick with gobs of philosophy.  If you're expecting anything more than that, you've got the wrong DVD.
6302886228|5.0|It has all the best songs. Bob Dylan gives a wonderful performence.
0451169514|5.0|I will keep this pretty short. There has been great deal that has been said about this novel already. It is horrifying, touching, insightful etc.  Indeed it is all of those things.  But in my opinion it doesn't get the credit it deserves by the more academic critics.  &quot;It&quot; is rarely featured reading in colleges, or high schools.  And I think that is something of a travesty.  This is one of the great American novels. This book is the kind of thing a writer dreams their whole life to create.<br />That is all.

I have yet to view the dvd, maybe it has better sound. As for the reviewer wondering if the cd set comes with a booklet? Yes it does, its in between the middle part of the foldout. Check it out.......good luck!
B0000640VO|2.0|This is my favourite movie ever.  Amelie is the sweetest person and her good deeds are inspiring.  I felt so great after watching this movie that I was utterly speechless.  I think i'm going to watch it again tonight!
B0000AXE8I|5.0|I was thrilled with this second movie.  The intrigue of the first movie is still there, with the addition of Neo's new found powers.  They also expanded Morpheus role in the world of Zion.  The new characters in this film were a small thrill.  The twins, hmmmm, will they return?  The architect, how many times have we done this now?  It even touches on the love between Neo and Trinity this time.  With a pretty hot love scene.  Yep, it did it for me....<br />Can't wait for REVOLUTIONS
B0000AZJXQ|2.0|After every Tool Cd, and APC's 1st, I have come to expect a more impressive effort from Maynard. The songs are all missing a lot of feeling. Over trying to make a classic,maybe. This CD is just plain EMPTY! No powerful words, sounds or vocals. I like 3 songs on this, and none of those compare to anything else MJK has ever done.
0385504209|5.0|An exciting book. You cant put it down because it is so exciting.
B000068PQ0|5.0|I don't know how to describe this music, but it's really cool! Most of it is synthesized instruments and sound-effects, but the best part of it is the precussion. <BR>1. Fight Test - This song is like the best ever! It has a great beat and it's very catchy. 5/5<BR>2. One More Robot - Okay, so I find singing about robots very strange, but apart from the lyrics, this song is good. The singer also has a different sounding voice. It's not bad, though. 4/5<BR>3. Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots Pt. 1 - This song's lyrics are funny. It's so cool, though! Very catchy. 5/5<BR>4. &quot;   &quot; Pt. 2 - No singing (if you don't count Yoshimi's karate yells and screams...) just weird noises and very cool precussion. 3.5/5<BR>5. In the Morning of Magicians - This song is awesome! Between the beginning, middle, and ending theme, (which are the best parts of the whole cd, I think) his singing is soooo slow (I usually fast forward it until I get to the good parts), but it's worth it! You'll probably have this song on repeat a lot. It sounds like a theme song to a movie :) 5/5<BR>6. Ego Tripping - A nice, peaceful song. I like it. 4.5/5<BR>7. Are You a Hypnotist?? - This song makes me wish I played the drums! It will definately have your fingers tapping...or whatever. 5/5!!!<BR>8. It's Summertime - An overall nice song. Catchy beat. 4/5<BR>9. Do You Realize?? - A song you can sing along to! They should play this song on the radio. A great tune. 4/5<BR>10. All We Have is Now - The only song I hit the skip button on. There's nothing great about this song, in my opinion. Plus it has some freaky robotic voice repeating what the words are in the background. 2/5<BR>11. Approaching Pavonis Mons by Balloon - All instrumental, a nice tune with sound-effects and someone making weird noises. lol 4/5<BR>Anywhoo...if you're thinking about getting this cd, DO SO! You won't regret it! :-)
B00008EY9G|4.0|Your basic scarey film with a plot that travels in a circle.  It involves a \\"random\\" group of people that all end up at the same motel.  Horrible events bring them there and continue throughout their visit.    It doesn't come together until the end of the film, because of all the flashbacks/flashforward...but if you take the time to watch it you will be surprised in the end.  It is NOT what you thought.
B000056VJ7|5.0|It is a rare thing to combine excitement, high quality music, and meaningful lyrics into one album. Meat Loaf does this in all the albums I own, including his class Bat out of Hell. If you have never heard Meat, start here, then try Bat out of Hell II. You won't be disappointed. Enjoy.
B000084T18|1.0|Doo-Doo! You want to hear some lyrics, listen to someone like Talib Kweli or Mos Def. This dude can't rap. The little girls just see his muscles and go crazy. What a waste of beats.
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|I bought this cd the very day it came out...I expected it to be more..hmm..hardcore, I suppose. I was a little dissapointed when I first listened to it. But I've been listening to it a lot more lateley, and it's growing on me. That's not what I wanted from this album though. I thought it was going to be another incredible production, like all other's from dear Maynard. The songs are fine, but the lyrics...They just don't move me like all his others have.  It's ok though, just another cd to listen to while driving. =)
B000089RVR|2.0|Its so sad that an artist like Dido, mildly pleasant but ultimately bland and MOR, has to be the mainstream reprasentative of what was the greatest musical movement of the 90s (and, yes, I haven't forgotten grunge). Portishead, Massive Attack, Faithless and DJ Shadow blaze the way for intelligent dance music, chilled, slowed hip-hop and that kind of mood music, and then Dido, assisted by brother Rollo from Faithless makes the formula a housewive's favourite by combining it with bland &quot;adult pop&quot; and safe, flavourless arrangements. OK, so No Angel was a nice enough album, but Life For Rent just stretches the point. Why does this kind of thing have to clog up the charts rather than some new, original music pushing through?
B000066NW0|1.0|I heard Avril Lavigne \\"sing\\" live in concert last month. My God!<br />Miss Lavigne should get down on her knees and thank the Lord for TC-Helicon's VoiceOne program, which allows sound engineers to modulate the pitch and timbre of the human voice, mainly so they can correct bad intonation and beef up a thin, puny voice. It's a godsend to talentless singers everywhere. Without it, Avril would have no recording career at all. She's that bad, folks.<br />Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to scrub the inside of my skull with boric acid and steel wool in a vain attempt to scour from my memory all traces of that dismal travesty of a concert. Oh, the humanity!
B000084T18|2.0|50 can't even talk. How the hell is he gonna rap? g-g-g-g-g gaaarbage!
0140177396|5.0|ive just finished reading this book and like many others was forced to read it to answer year 11 course work, although i was pleasently surprised. A book full of dreams even in a sad discrimative world. This book shows a very unusual couple Lennie and George working and living together to make their simply dreams come true, until life comes along in its interfering way.<BR>The best and most moving thing ive ever read with a true and powerful message true to us all. Not to be missed.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|This DVD is the next best thing to seeing Cher live in concert. The colour and the sound jump off the screen. It truly is the &quot;Cherist Cher Show&quot; Even if your are not a huge Cher fan buy this, you wont regret it! Cher puts on a fantastic performace that you wont forget. You will want to watch this DVD over and over again!!
B0000636UN|1.0|I can't believe this woman has a recording contract. Her songs alter between bland and uninteresting to unbelievably irritating. My introduction to &quot;The Crow&quot; was that simply awful &quot;All I Want To Do Is Have Some Fun&quot; song which really set the tone for how creatively inept she is. Last year I had the pleasure of attending my first Rolling Stones concert, which was almost perfect. For some odd reason, The Crow opened up. We timed our pre-concert dining almost perfectly so that we would miss her entire set. As we walked through the parking lot, unfortunately we could hear &quot;If It Makes You Happy&quot; which is probably in the Top 10 list of worst songs ever written. We overlooked this small annoyance, and looked forward to what was almost a perfect Rolling Stones concert. Almost. During their classic hit, &quot;Honky Tonk Women,&quot; The Crow came out and sang it with them. She managed to ruin a really good song for me. I want this woman and her bad music out of my life!!!!!!!!!<br />Incidentally, I know everybody reading this will give me an &quot;unhelpful&quot; vote because that seems to be the case on Amazon. If you agree with the review, you say it is helpful. People don't seem to realize that they are not asking whether you like the review or agree with it. Morons. No wonder you listen to Sheryl Crow.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|\\"Thirteenth Step\\" is not a clone of APC's first effort, so if you're looking for a regurgitated \\"Mer de Noms,\\" you're out of luck.  Personally, I hate monotony; I hate bands who have \\"a sound\\" and miss some really great creative opportunities because they're enslaved by an idiom.  There's always danger in innovation (example: Metallica's \\"St. Anger\\"), but the really great artists, who stick around for a while, push the limits of what their fans are comfortable with.  APC has done this, successfully, for the most part.  The variety of \\"Thirteenth Step\\" is also very refreshing, but that's no surprise; everything Keenan touches comes across that way.  \\"The Nurse Who Loved Me\\" followed by \\"Pet\\"?  Absolutely shocking!  And great!<br />Paz et al will be missed, but the revised APC is still a strong, talented outfit.  Thanks for sticking around, Maynard, Billy, and Josh.  Welcome, Jeordie and James.  And thanks for some more really strong songs, Billy and Maynard.  My favorite on the album has to be \\"Blue\\": great lyrics, some kick-ass vocals and vocal harmonies, great structure, and a killer bass line!  \\"The Package,\\" \\"The Outsider,\\" and \\"Pet\\" are also pretty solid.<br />One thing I love about both of APC's albums is their use of unconventional time signatures unpretentiously; they make 7/8 feel natural, but they also make the orthodox 4/4 and 3/4 exciting again.<br />I'm frightened, however, by the preponderance of ambient tracks on this album.  Take a lesson from Radio Head's \\"Kid A,\\" guys: if you're interested in holding on to a fan base and not only satisfying your own creative impulses (but that's your choice), don't forget to keep it heavy, and don't lose solid, well-structured songs to meandering spells of ethereal, computery sounds and underdeveloped sound concepts.  They make good breaks between songs, but they should never be the substance of a whole album, or very much of it at all.
0140177396|4.0|After reading the novel of Mice and Men, i gave the book four stars because it is a very interesting. This book always kept me entertained. In my opnion the whole book was the climax because therof the novel. George and Lennie are two great characters that protrayed a great friendship. Although Lennie was slow, you got a sense of how protective George was of him. There jounray across the country to find there dreams by getting a house together, thought would have come true but was tragically ended.
B000002IU9|5.0|I've only heard every album preceding this so far (except Sign of the Hammer).  But unless Warriors of the World is the most kick-ass Manowar album I'll ever hear this is by far their best.  The production is bigger than the early-eighties albums.  But the mtv-leanings that the last two albums had with songs like &quot;Blow your Speakers&quot; and &quot;Kings of Metal&quot; are gone.  Instead the best elements of both those times, the purely medieval focus of Hail to England and the cleaner production of Fighting the World are combined in Triumph of Steel for the best Manowar album I've heard.  All the songs are great but the best is Spirit Horse of the Cherokee (even though it is a pretty stereotypical view of Native Americans).  Anyway if any Manowar album is worth your money, it would be this one.
B0000AI45P|1.0|The addition of the bonus tracks takes away from the impact of this album. The art of the album is one of the strongest aspects of music. It's not enough just to write good songs. Thoughtful, effective album structure coupled with consistent, overarching themes enhances the musical experience. You wouldn't add bonus tracks to Abbey Road now would you? All albums should be treated with the same respect.
630438551X|5.0|This film was genius. Baz Luhrmann is amazing. He manages to team the original Shakespeare script with a modern setting and it works brilliantly! The actors and actresses are great and each character is portrayed really well. The soundtrack is really good as well! I enjoyed every minute of it. The language may be confusing at first, but you soon get used to it. The prologue is a brilliant start to it and very dramatic! Watch it!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|All I can say about his album is that it is phenomenal~ Once again a perfect circle has produce a beautiful album that captures many aspects of emotion. The new line up is amazing adding a lot of great bass lines and excellent guitar riffs. As always Maynards vocals are a gift from the heaven above. Despite people saying this album is mellow I feel that it rocks harder than the first because of the deep bass tones and rockinh guitar riff. 13th step is a definate must have for anyone who apreciates music and understands that good expressive music is a dying art form.
076790592X|5.0|I have to say, reading Tuesdays with Morrie was an excellent book.  I got a lot out of it.  I can honestly relate to this book perfectly.  From the moment I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down.  This book was about life lessons.  <BR>There was a strong friendship between Mitch and his dying teacher, Morrie.  They both went their separate ways.  Finally reuniting after sixteen years, they became close again.  Mitch decided to visit Morrie every Tuesday, just as like he was going to class again.  They would talk about everything in going on in each other's lives.  While Mitch was visiting, he notice Morrie getting weaker and weaker.  Mitch realized it was finally time to say goodbye and let Morrie die.  <BR>I would recommend this book to everyone with a problem.  This book covers many issues.  For instance: love, money, marriage, family, and death.  Everybody can relate to this book.  It's excellent!
B0000C0FJB|5.0|Great album.  Although the mix is sort of heavy (something I found fault in with Different Stages as well), the quality is otherwise amazing.<br />Saw the Detroit show of this tour, and will say that this CD does a pretty good job of capturing the spirit of the show.<br />A song by song review would be overkill [31 songs in total!], but there are countless highlights on here (YYZ, Natural Science, Secret Touch, La Villa Strangiato, and Working Man come to mind).<br />Fans will love this album, but people who are new to the band should probably start with a studio album.
0385504209|5.0|I haven't met a person who has read this book and not loved it. I just had to read it and am so glad I did. It was one of the best books I've ever read, and I read a lot. The conbination of fact and fiction really bring the story to life. It really makes you thing about everything that happens in this world that we don't know about.
B00005JKES|5.0|I loved this DVD set, and although it did not include Pilot, i got it on a separate DVD, which is fine with me, the thing which worries me is when will we see SEASON 2?????? Can anybody answer this question?? This is one of my favorite shows on tv ever, so i would love to have the complete collection at home! For true fan of David Lynch's work its a must, and i would recommend to everyone who did not had the pleasure of seeing Twin Peaks to WATCH IT NOW!:)
B0000A02TZ|1.0|I purchased this DVD expecting a professional movie, instead it is filled with commercials that cannot be skipped.  This is disgusting
038572179X|3.0|I had heard about this book for quite a while, and it was on my list of `must read, someday' books.   Having read it now, I consider it a well crafted melodrama<BR>so don't be put of by its `literary' reputation.  The book is divided into four major episodes concerning a certain family and friends before, during and after World War II. There is an air of foreboding in each episode and each chapter seems to detail events which, while appearing normal, seem to be bringing doom closer.  In this, I think, the crafting to the pace of the book draws the reader onwards to find out what happens. The descriptive passages had less power for me than the dialogue, however the story was compelling.<BR> The main character is an aspiring novelist and this I found to be the aspect I liked least.  I find writers writing about writing to be self referential, boring and bland, and this features more in the book than I think is necessary.  It seemed to me to break, rather than enhance, the flow of the book and to provide very little by way of insight into the thought processes of the characters.  This was the main flaw I thought in an<BR>otherwise entertaining read.
B000089CJI|5.0|When I first heard this CD it brought me to my knees. Death Cab, Figurine, and Rilo Kiley all together making one great batch of music. Shoot me in the head if I ever find better music than this, please. Some of these songs might get a little too much air-time for us hardcore fans, but dont be scared. We still have what brought this band together, and its not going anywhere. Listen and enjoy this music, its the best sound your ears will ever hear.
0385504209|3.0|I'm as partial to anti-Catholic conspiracy theories as the next man. I like reading those books about how the pyramids were built by a lost race from outer space, and how all world power stems from a Freemason/Knights of Malta conspiracy dating back 700 years, involving the Holy Grail and the nail-clippings of Christ. I'm also very much in favour of the ever-fashionable fictional technique of turning history to mush. Like most people, I'd much rather read a poorly written &quot;thriller&quot; with plot complexity and page mass in place of character, profundity or truth, catering to the paranoias and neuroses of the masses than, say, a history book. Here, finally, is apparently a book that combines all of my interests. I haven't managed to get around to reading it yet, however, because I'm still struggling through &quot;The Lost Druid Tribe of Atlantis: How A Race Of Ancient Druids Invented The 'Popular Esoteria' Genre From The Primordial Soup&quot;. I fully expect a committee of Vatican Bishops to destroy all copies of this book before I get my hands on a copy, anyway, so my 3 star rating must remain conjectural.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|A fan of classic films, this is one film with which I actually did not become familiar until I started dating my husband about 10 years ago. This is an all-time favorite of his.  He was turned on by the great score by Korngold, but became a true fan once he experienced the charm and hilarity of the dialogue, exquisite cinematography, and respect for the actual history upon which the Robin Hood legends are based.  Thanks to him, this treasure is now a favorite of mine as well!<br />We could barely wait until it came out; we rushed out the first night it was available and stayed up until the wee hours looking through the special features included in this 2-disc edition.  The features are fun and informative, but the greatest gift this DVD gave to us was a realization of the Technicolor.  We put our VHS tape in and syncronized the two versions and the result was staggering!  Did you know that the dress worn by Lady Marion when first she meets Robin actually sparkles?  The Sheriff's cloak is purple?!  It was as if a new movie had been released.<br />The extra-special treat for me was the addition of the classic Warner Bros. cartoons starring Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny: 2 bits of fun I wasn't even expecting.  <br />A must for any collection; this is a GREAT film and a fantastic DVD!
B000063DI9|5.0|seventh son of a seventh son is an absolute masterpiece which is only knocked off the thrown by the flawless number of the beast.This album is pure musical genius which was created by an ensemble of truly talented and skilled artists.They started experimenting with creating a unique sound which really makes you feel the magical and spiritual essence of this album.There are not too many heavy metal bands or artists in general which can match the pure genius of this cd.The album cover art is their best ever and the lyrics are very interesting to say the least.To concude,if you dont own this the you are not a true maidenfan.UP THE IRONS!!!
0064409422|4.0|This book The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe, by C.S. Lewis is a novel that makes you wonder what¡¯s going to happen next, and made me think what was the reason that people called Peter and Edmund the ¡°Sons of Adam¡±, and what was the reason that peole called Susan and Lucy ¡°Daughters of Eve¡±.<br />This book The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe, is about four young children named Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy.  Peter is the oldest out of the four, Susan is second oldest, Edmund is second youngest, and Lucy is the youngest out of the four.  These four young children were send to live at a professor¡¯s house at London.  One day they were playing hide and go seek and lucy hid in a wardrobe, soon she discovered that she was in a land called Narnia.  Then her brother Edmund discoverers the secret hidden inside the wardrobe.  Edmund then befriended the Queen, and promise that he will bring his brother and sisters to the queen.  Then Edmund told his brother and sisters to come to Narnia and meet the queen, but they refused, then Edmund betrayed his brother and sisters by going away to the castle that the White Witch lived in, and telling her where his brothers and sisters are, and told her that Aslan was on the move.  The witch then sended her minions to stop Aslan.  All of her minions had failed her, and the spell that the witch cast upon the land of Narnia had weakened.  The White Witches minions had failed her, because Aslan had the help of Peter, Susan, Lucy, and later the help of Edmund.  Later Edmund can no longer withstand how the witch had treated him, and he escaped.  Then a huge battle between the side of Aslan and the side (Good) of the White Witch (Evil), will begin.  Instead of either side winning, Aslan made a promise to the Witch.  The battle was finally over, and later Peter was announced as ¡°King Peter¡±, Edmund was announced as ¡°King Edmund¡±, Susan was announced as ¡°Queen Susan¡±, and Lucy was announced as ¡°Queen Lucy¡±.  This was only the starting of Narnia.<br />I think the author is trying to tell us that fighting is not the only way to solve a problem, and the author wants us to know that this is only the starting of Narnia. This book shows great trust.
B00000348D|4.0|This is considered a cornerstone of atonal free-form jazz. What that means is that there just is no diatonic framework for the song. &quot;Free&quot; is just another word for that. Call it &quot;accidental&quot; or &quot;absence of a key&quot;, in this strict sense it is neither really atonal nor free. Coleman never called his music &quot;Free Jazz&quot; either, except this album. <br />Given the fact, that his was recorded 1960, it's hard to call it revolutionary. Comparing the monotonous rhythm of this recording with the liberated drums of a Charles Mingus album from that time, it still is quite traditional for that matter. As an experiment it didn't fail, because you can tell it is just that, an experiment.
B000056K04|3.0|If you're expecting the kind of music that you could imagine yourself listening to with a small gathering at a live performance, this is not it.  This is the most &quot;studio&quot; sounding of all the albums for sure.  There are, however, some highlights, such as So Right and Angel, and of course the radio singles.  <br />DMB's three strong points are its songs, its style, and its incredible instrumental talent.  This album has the first two, but instrumental talent is definitely eclipsed.  Before These Crowded Streets remains my favorite album because it has strong examples of all three.  You can enjoy Dave's vocals and the pensive songs just as much on this album, but if you're familiar with their earlier work, you'll know what's missing.
B000063DHL|5.0|I would absolutely recommend this album to any one with an interest in metal.Somewhere in time is one of maidens best work with wonderful songs like wasted years and caught somewhere in time.The sound production is superb and the many well made songs will forever hold a place in your heart.You cant go wrong in picking up this masterpiece album.LONG LIVE IRON MAIDEN!!!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|unbelievable. different from MDN, but thats what it should be. bands should change style, try new things, and APC does this in a great way.  for all you haters of the album- get a clue.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|THE WORDS I WRITE IS MY EFFORT FOR YOU TO SEE THAT IRON MAIDEN CAN´T DISAPOINT THE FANS, THIS COULD BE THE LAST MAIDEN RELEASE <BR>AND SOME NOT TRUE MAIDEN FANS DON´T REALLY LIKE IT BUT IF YOU HAVE FOLLOWED THEM SINCE IRON MAIDEN AND TAKE HEED OF THE FINE RIFFS AND THE STRANGE WAY TO MAKE YOU DREAM OF THINGS NEVER KOWN <BR>THOU SHALL OPEN THY EYES:<br />WILDEST DREAMS AND RAIN MAKER : A (SPIRIT RAISER)<br />NO MORE LIES,MONTSÉGUR AND PASCHENDALE : A (MAKE YOU A STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND)<br />DANCE OF DEATH, FACE IN THE SAND,AGE OFINNOCENCE AND JOURNEYMAN:A+ (THE TRAVEL TO THE YEARS AND FEELINGS YOU HAD)<br />GATES OF TOMORROW AND NEW FRONTIER:A+ (NEW JEWELS FOR THIS GOLDEN YEARS)<br />IF YOU ARE OF OUR RACE YOU´LL UNDERSTAND....JUST REMEMBER.
B000063DI8|5.0|I dont get why this album has gotten alot of negative reviews because it plainly kicks ass.Most of the songs are excellent with one or two which are mediocre.The only songs which I cant get into are the assassins and run silent run deep.Although I wouldnt go as far as to say that this album is a masterpiece,it's however very good.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AND UP THE IRONS!!!
630469654X|5.0|My inspiration for writing this review was reading how much critics hated the sound track.  Man, what a bad rap!!!  In my opinion, the movie had comedy, romance, action, a sexy female lead, spirituality...and the soundtrack just set it off.  Set it off, mate!!!  I am not necessarily a fan of all of Alan Parsons' projects, but he really did this movie justice.  The musical score is excellent Alan!!!  I wish I had written the damn thing.
B000063DIH|5.0|This album seems to get mixed reviews,but personally I think this is a very solid effort from the heavy metal masters known as Iron Maiden.It may not be a flawless masterpiece like number of the beast,but it's still a very good album which will eventually grow on you.The songs range from slow to medium to fast.Standout tracks include be quick or be dead and from here to eternity.Trust me,this is worth your money and probably the last maiden album truly worth owning.UP THE IRONS!!!
B0000CD5I6|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised upon listening to the Jethro Tull Christmas Album.  For one thing there are at least 5 vocals that have been re-recorded again and actually sound better this time around.  There are also 7 instrumentals on this CD which include violins, cello, viola, guitars, drums and of course Ian on flute.       I've been very happy with this CD since it has 16 songs and there's not a weak one in the bunch.  I'd have to say \\"Another Christmas Song\\"* and \\"First Snow On Brooklyn\\" stand out for me since they are new songs and Ian's voice sounds very clear.      Then every single instrumental is a standout especially \\"Greensleeved.\\"  If you're a Tull fan, you won't be disappointed here.  In fact, you'll be singing right along with \\"I believe in fires at midnight, when the dogs have all been fed.....\\"  Etc.  This is probably one of the best Tull albums made in years.  Enjoy it!    Note:  I recently found out that \\"Another Christmas Song\\" was on the Rock Island CD.  They re-recorded it for the Christmas Album and Ian's voice sounds a lot clearer than it did previously.  The instrumentation is also different ..... for the better.  Sorry for my mistake.  DRM
0783226845|5.0|As I was going through the Video collection of my friend yesterday, my eyes caught the title &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot;. On seeing this my heart started beating a bit faster making me rush it into the DVD player! Although I watched almost the entire film till about 30 minutes from the end, hoping for &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot; in some unexpected turnaround, when it came to an end finally, it left me with an immense sense of  satisfaction of having watched a wonderful film. The subtle thread of human relations going through the film -- amongst the Schoolmates, between the Colonel and his assistant -- oh, it was lovely. Human values scored at the end, and Al Pacino gave a master performance of a monologue while attending the disciplinary proceedings at the boy's school! I would ofcourse watch the film again and again and again! <br />Although the title of the film gives an altogether different idea about the film, the contents of course does not deceive us.
B00004TS0E|2.0|First things first...why even bother to remake such a great movie.  Oh, I know, it was remade in the 1970's with sebastian Cabot in a made for TV movie, but still.  This is a classic that will always stand on its own.<br />You will never be able to surpass the original, the bar is too high.  You know the story...a man who looks like Santa is hired to play Jolly Ol' St. Nick at a department store and then gets into trouble when he insists he's the real deal.<br />Unfortunately, this movie has none of the warmth, charm, humor, or magick of the original.  The actors all seem to be sleep walking, the little girl playing the Natalie Wood role is annoying, and the courtroom sequence and ending is devoid of the magic that made you wonder if there really is a Santa.<br />Skip this and stick with the original
1400034779|4.0|I was going crazy after finishing the latest of Van Reid's Moosepath League books,wondering how I could wait until the next one is published,and praying there was something else out there that was as fun,funny,and heartwarming,as well written and engaging.  Then a friend told me about a recomendation from Amazon and lent me the first of this new mystery series.  It is wonderful and just what I needed after my post Moosepath let down.  Like the best mysteries, character and place come first,and the suspense comes out of caring about the people in the story.  I need to get the second book right away.  I'm having a post Ladies' Detective Agency let down!
B00007BH3Y|5.0|Ok, Philip Glass has done it once again. The man really knows his stuff. I thought &quot;Einstein on the Beach&quot; was genius . . . HA! This soundtrack does more for this film than you could imagine. You can feel the pain, you feel the suffering, you KNOW what these women feel by following the circular rhythms of this amazing score. Their pain is the pain that is felt over and over again through the ages, and the music provides such an amazing correlation of those facts that it will leave you breathless. Let it be known that Philip Glass knows good music, and THIS is good music.
B000089RVR|5.0|If you liked No Angel, then Life For Rent is a must have. While she hasn't changed a bit and remains a sweet and charming lady, Dido's music has been taken to a new level all together.<BR>From the dancy 'Sand in my shoes' to the sweet and slow 'Mary's in India' to the hitsingles 'White Flag' and 'Life For Rent', Dido's new album is filled with the most beautiful sounds, lyrics and the most impressive voice.<BR>Her lyrics sometimes tend to a dark side, slightly melancholic and depressed. Yet there is always a sweet touch, a bit of joy and a lot of love. Listening to 'See the sun' you feel the pain and misery, yet you are uplifted by the sweet chorus where she promises 'you'll see the sun again. And you're asking me why pains the only way to happiness, and I promise you you'll see the sun again'. Combine this with her incredible voice, touching you in your heart and your mind, and you have an album in which you can lose yourself completely while listening.<br />If you've heard the cd once, you haven't heard it at all. Thanks to Dido's brother and producer Rollo Armstrong, the cd is filled with the most fantastic sounds and tunes. Everytime you listen to Life For Rent, you discover a new bell, a new whistle, a new set of strings. This is what makes the music complete. It is not the mindless beats of today's dj's. It's not the simple pop that takes up all the air time. Life For Rent is a modern day symphony, it is a musical festival in itself. Pop, dance, all the types of music you can imagine, are combined to form an album. A true pleasure to listen to, time and time again.<br />If you are looking for a cd to fill the void in today's supply of pop and trance then Life For Rent is what you need. It guarantees hours of listening pleasure and it guarantees to blow you away completely.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|As A 15 Year Old Music fan I Think The Girls Of t.A.T.u. Are Positive Role Models And They Sure Know How To Make Addictive Music. When I First Got Into This Group I heard Chat About \\"All The Things She Said\\", I Heard It On A Weekly radio Show At The Time I Didnt Care What It Was I Just Wanted To Hear Rap, Than I decided To Give The Girls A Chance, And Later I Discovered A Song Called \\"Not Gonna Get us\\", This Is Total Hardcore Dance Music, I heard It On A Radio Show And thatS The reason Why I purchased This CD. t.A.T.u Know Quite A Bit About \\"Love\\" And How To Express Their Feelings For Eachother As Displayed On \\"Show Me Love\\" (A Rock-Based Song, Where They Attempt To use The F Word), And \\"Malchik Gay\\", Where They Sound Like They Are Having Lots Of Fun Expressing Their Feelings. All The Songs On This CD Are Good, Thats Why It Got A 5 Star rating, The Russian Versions Of \\"All the Things She Said\\" And \\"Not Gonna Get Us\\" Are Very Enjoyable To listen To And Its Fun To Try To Understand What They Are Saying. My Only Problem With This CD IS The Length Because Technically They're Are Only 8 Songs Because They're Is Just Another Version Of \\"Shoe Me Love\\" Which Sounds The Same, And The 2 Russian Songs. \\"30 Minutes\\" Is A Great Ballad I Only Wish that It Would Countinue For 30 Minutes, If You Are Happy Which I Am, You Will Enjoy The Message This CD Puts Out, And The Positive Messsages Make us Think That WE CAN LOVE TO! \\"Can You See Me Now\\" Is Another Dance Song Well Its Called \\"Clowns\\" But Thats A Scary Title Because I Dont Understand Why they Are Talkign About Clowns. The Russian/English Song \\"Stars\\", Finds One Of The t.A.T.u Girls Singing Ballad Over A Violin And The Other Rapping In Russian, its A Nice Mix. Overall This CD Will Not Disappoint Any Music Fan (Hopefully), Because These Girls Really Got Their Priorites Straight. I Hope To See More From Them In The Future! <BR>From ya Boy <BR>Chris (15 year Old Music Fan)
B000084T18|5.0|Anyone who attempts to compare 50 cent to Biggie or Tupac does not understand rap.  Hell, Dre himself would never make the mistake of comparing anyone to those two.  Lyrically, 50 cent is nowhere near Tupac and his delivery is fractionally as lucid as Biggie's.<br />With this premise in mind, this CD is a fantastic combination of production, rhythm, fluid rapping, and timely guest appearances.  Fifty-cent's greatest strength is his ability to melt into the beats so expertly laid out by Dre.  There are tracks on this CD that are literally flawless.  In these days of ill-fated offbeat attempts you rarely hear an album that &quot;fits.&quot;  <br />If you buy one rap album this year, this is the one.
B00005Y1UX|1.0|I'll keep it brief.  It's trashy, almost physically painful to watch, and embarassing.  It's so bad, that I'll even cast it among the ranks of Stargate and Independence Day, which at least had a few pan drippings of &quot;fun,&quot; albeit the kind of idiotic fun you feel when you see a movie that should end up in Mystery Science Theater. Save your time and your bucks.  Walk away from this dud.  Quickly.
B0000C7PQK|4.0|Well now, this is different... If you're expecting the same old Enigma sound than you're bound to be sourly disappointed, and many fans seem to be. When I first heard 'Voyageur' I didn't know what to think of it because I refused to believe all the negative reviews coming from this album but as much as I hate to admit it, they're mostly true. They are, however, a bit exaggerated. This isn't nearly as bad as some make it out to be. It's definitely several steps down from their previous accomplishments but it's far from disastrous.<br />Either Cretu's gotten lazy (he's had several years to work on this) or he's looking to change Enigma completely, and if that's the case and if this is a taste of what's to come than I really hope he's able to improve himself because this record does hold a modicum of potential but I feel that certain key elements to making this transaction a success are missing here. 'Voyageur' to me sounds slightly rushed and low on the passion that they're known to deliver. Even the artwork looks thrown together and I miss the breathy words of Sandra, which are pretty much gone, and the inspiring quotes often found in the booklet. There are a few exceptions though that almost, but not quite, make up for the lack of Gregorian chants, ethnic sampling, and their trademark flute pipes that briefly tease us in the opening track, \\"From East To West\\"... Maybe it's his way of saying goodbye to the old and in with the new as the light electronica comes in with a steady rhythm that gradually picks up speed but never explodes into anything mind-blowing... The title track is an alright song that reminds me a little of \\"Turn Around\\", which can be found on their greatest hits compilation, 'LSD', but \\"Look Of Today\\" is a perfect example of what this band must strive for if they wish to continue down this path. It has some high energy dance beats that take full control of my body movements every time it comes on, seducing my senses, while \\"Boum-Boum\\" is a strange but highly addictive euro-pop tune featuring the voice of Michael himself (unlike some people, I personally love when he sings) and Ruth-Ann from the trip-hop group Olive (I'm not sure but they might be defunct now) who first appeared on Enigma's last full-length album, 'The Screen Behind The Mirror', which is similar to this but, in my opinion, better. What truly makes this record worth buying though is \\"The Piano\\" which has the most breathtaking piano playing amidst a lush new age beat (this track may be short but it emanates beauty and passion and that's precisely what I meant when I said this album mostly lacks those qualities) as well as \\"Following The Sun\\"; a gorgeous song to close with that graces us for the second time with the angelic female vox of Ruth-Ann whom seems to be a very vital asset to this group now, keeping them together with her hypnotic singing style. Those two songs keep hope remaining in my heart that this journey of sensual meets spiritual will once again merge as one, and if Cretu wants to experiment than fine, but I pray they don't become another ambient electronic group that's here today and gone tomorrow. Enigma is one of my favorite bands and I really wanna see them end on top because that's where they started and that's where they belong.ut highly addictive euro-pop tune featuring the voice of Michael himself (unlike some people, I personally love when he sings) and Ruth-Ann from the trip-hop group Olive (I'm not sure but they might be defunct now) who first appeared on Enigma's last full-length album, 'The Screen Behind The Mirror', which is similar to this but, in my opinion, better.

B0000C8AQE|2.0|Last year Capitol released &quot;Simply the best&quot; on DVD and a lot of fans were very disappointed with it. The 1991 laserdisc release had even more tracks on it then the new DVD release???<BR>Capitol/EMI should release a complete video anthology of Turner starting with &quot;Ball of confusion&quot; from 1982 to &quot;Whatever you need&quot; in 2000 ! Why release this cd/combo set ? only for die hard fans who want to spend money and get nothing extra. I'm a very big Turner fan, but I am going to pass on this one...
B00004Y7SF|1.0|this cd is pure trash, just look at the name, and shes practically naked on the cover. It disgusts me that the tramp she is would actually go after something like x-mas, i mean come on she just made this cd to get people mad at her again. This is dirty ol' man music.
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is the story of Ender Wiggin, a child-soldier in a dim future where wars are won electronically. I listened to the audio version of this novel, but after a while, had to listen to this in seclusion! LOL, my father HATED the fact that the aliens were called 'Bugger,' and every time this was mentioned rather LOUDLY in the beginning by Peter, he'd strenuously object.<br />Other than the term 'bugger,' I thought this book was really fast paced, and exciting, if at times a little gruesome. Ender is an enjoyable character, 'caught up' by events beyond his control who you can really empathize with. The other characters are quite endearing: with two exceptions: I honestly wish Peter had been done away with. This character was irritating in the extreme... And Valentine? What's with Card making all his genius characters mentally ill? I wish she'd sought help for her pyromania. I won't even go there about Peter's psychotic tendencies.<br />Other than that, LOVED Card's work. Will definitely be looking up the next book in the series!
B00005JM02|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, i like all of pixars work; and this one just brings back those good old memorys of when i was a kid and watched kids movies. I felt warm and fuzzy again.<br />Also for what its worth the sharks in this are well represented, except they are predators really. I mean they look like sharks, the blue shark especially looks, incredibley real; its a little small but thats ok. I'm sure there are small blue sharks out there.
B00000DCHE|5.0|Songs in the Attic is a wonderful glimpse at a performer at his peak.  Coming off of the huge commercial success of Glass Houses and 52nd Street, Billy changes gears completely.  Instead of releasing a live album that recycles his more recent hits, he dusts off some of his earlier work and presents it to us in a live setting.  <br />You can see in these performances the brilliance and passion of an artist who is completely committed to his material.  Whether it be the intimacy of \\"You're My Home\\" performed in a small club or the intensity of \\"Captain Jack\\" in a large arena, each performance seems perfectly set in the appropriate venue. <br />Billy Joel is at his absolute best here.  I particularly recommend \\"Songs\\" to the fan who has only seen Billy in his more mundane concerts of the last few years, often paired with Elton John. This album shows you a performer at his creative peak.
B00005JMNY|1.0|This biopic of club kid/murderer Michael Alig is monstrously bad. The quality of the script, acting and style are on par with your average WB teen melodrama, but with a gigantic budget for drugs. If Macaulay Culkin intended this to be his comeback vehicle, think again Mac.<br />The only reedeming qualities of this flick are the costumes, Diana \\"Christina Crawford\\" Scarwid as Mama Alig with a coiffure by Hedwig and the Angry Inch, and Seth Green as Michael's pal and social mentor, James St. James.<br />Green portrays the most flamboyant character yet offers the most restrained performance, while parading around in outrageous costumes and six-inch heels. Yes, St. James is absolutely larger than life, but I didn't feel that Green was straining to emote, unlike the other actors. He was the only actor who wasn't completely tripped up by what a \\"controversial\\" personality he was portraying. <br />Additionally, this was one of the most homophobic gay films I've ever seen. Michael and his boyfriend lean in for a kiss and it fades to black? Give me a break.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|The best from the best band of all time!!!

6305014140|1.0|Well I didn't even make it through half the movie so I guess this can't be a full review. Firstly I don't see why everyone thinks this is the best movie ever. I was sickened by the violence, I had to turn it off when the monster ripped one of the characters arms off and began drinking the blood from his body while he was screaming for help. Im still feeling sick talking about it. The animation wasn't that great, either. So I really don't get what all the fuss is about, I wasn't impressed with it and I think it could have gone without the ultra-violence.
B000068PNQ|5.0|Sure it makes more logocial sense to simply buy the 'standard' version, its cheaper and you get what is really important, the music. I purchased the 'Deluxe Edition' because it was there in the record store and they didn't have the regular version. I paid more than twice what the standard edition cost (as I found out later at another record store), and yet somehow I don't feel cheated. Part of that i'm sure is the fact that the songs, unique, raw, powerful and like nothing I'd ever heard before, despite being into 'indy' bands supposedly heavily influenced by them. When \\"The Velvet Undergroud & Nico\\" was first released in '67, Andy Warhol, the 'producer' and 'manager' of the band, had previously mutated 'The Velvet Underound' into an art show production. The whole thing was wrapped up in Warhols packaging. From the peelable bannana to the stage show he had set up around it. So in a way this 'Deluxe Edition' somewhat caputures a fraction of what purchasing this album back in March 1967 might have been like.     The inclusion of a dual 'mono' mix of the albums seems a waste, which would have been better used if it contained outtakes, b-sides or other bits from the era. Though the Nico tracks included here are all from Chelsea girl and seem somewhat of a pointless inclusion I guess the general idea was to show what was being introduced in that era. The best thing however is the liner notes and CD packaging, which do as something to the asthetic feeling of the album.    Now to the music. The intense sounds and gritty realism of this album are bone chilling. Nothing else quite sounds like 'Velvet Underground'. Claimed by so many as an influence, from the cathartic and somber \\"Swans\\" to the lo-fi pop sound scapes of \\"Yo La Tengo\\", yet none come within a mile of replacting the genius and beauty of what Lou Reed and John Cale did back then. Soft, yet dark, melodic, yet dissonant. Essentially done by the band themselves the production is perhaps the best ever. Its raw without being incompotent, stripped down while still managing to seamlessly stitch together the musics layers.     Despite the bands annoyance at her having been thrust upon them, the 'Nico' songs are beautiful, and surreal. \\"All Tomorrow's Parties\\" sad cynicism and shuddering rythmic pummeling are beyond mere words. However its the Reed sung tracks, 'Heroin', 'Venus In Furs' and 'European Son' which really elevate this to a higher plane. Epic and desolate they invade the mind them shatter it.     Eventually whatever edition you get it doesn't matter. Just find the album and listen to it or you might well regret it.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|This band is being touted by the British Press as the next big thing and after hearing the CD I know why. They are amazing. The Cd is a good mix of ballads and hard rock. Jet can't help draw comparisons to the Rolling Stones, mostly because they play really good hard rock, amazing hard rock that is rare today, and they have that aura of coolness surrounding them that is so intriguing and rare. A must buy!
B000099T2L|5.0|Beyonce' Knowles delivers another platinum piece of work with her solo debut, &quot;Dangerously in Love&quot;.  The Destiny's Child frontwoman wrote and produced most of the 16 tracked album.  Songs like the bootyshakin' &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; and reggae fueled &quot;Baby Boy&quot; featuring rapper, Sean Paul, will have you pressing the repeat button on your stereo until you blister.  The second half of the disc only gets better with songs like &quot;Signs&quot; with Missy Elliot, &quot;Speechless&quot;, and the album's title, &quot;Dangerously in Love&quot;.  Also the hidden track at the end dedicated to her father/manager Matthew Knowles, definitely lets you appreciate and understand what a father and daughter relationship should be.  This is by far one of the greatest CD's this year!

B000002A3T|5.0|I'm 23 years of age and I'm one of those people who actually appreciate the older bands and artists for their raw talent, it wasnt always for the money but for the love. My mother always listened to Pink Floyd as I was growing up and when I was young I always made fun of it I guess because it wasnt cool to listen to this stuff when you are 10-12 years old. Pink Floyd has now become one of my favorite bands ever. IMHO...this is the best sounding album they have, its so smooth from start to finish. Its a record you can play while relaxing and you will just completely be overwhelmed by the music. Its so odd that all my friends that like a lil Pink Floyd here and there have never even heard of this album, I always tell them to pick it up and give it a shot cuz they dont know what they are missing, but they wont...thats fine though its their loss. If you like Floyd go get this album, throw it in the cd player and play it loud, admire the sound. \\"Marooned\\" is one of my favorite tracks on the album, no words to it just a relaxing tune. The whole album is great though.  Go get it!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This is one of the best rock cd's to come out in a while. The first album had some great tracks, but lacked a cohesive album fell as a whole. This album flows along nicely. Building energy as the album, not the track, progresses. Larger in scope than their first release, I think this album is on a whole different level, ala Kid A or dare I say it, Dark Side of the Moon.<br />Lofty expectations to be sure, but this album is that good.
B00000DHZJ|3.0|A good album, by a good Guitair player and an OK singer, but not as good as &quot;Cliff Richard : The Whole Story&quot;.
6305205620|5.0|This DVD of a &quot;Summer 1997&quot; performance by Metallica, was released in December 1998, some 5 years ago. I own the VHS format, which is nothing, but the 2 hour concert shown in it's entirety. Since this tape captutes the &quot;Load&quot; tour, it features some of that album's core singles, but the guys of Metallica don't shy away from playing selections from their 1980's albums, as well as a few numbers from &quot;The Black Album (1991).&quot;<BR>The opener &quot;So What&quot;, is a cover song originally recorded in 1981 by some British Heavy Metal group. The heavy rocker &quot;Creeping Death (from &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot;)&quot; follows.<BR>Most if not all of this video consists of tracks off of 1984's<BR>&quot;Ride the Lightning&quot;, &quot;Metallica (1991)&quot;, and the under-rated &quot;Load (1996).&quot; &quot;Master of Puppets (1986)&quot; is the only track off of that same album, and &quot;One&quot; is the only composition taken from &quot;...And Justice for All (1988).&quot; Of course &quot;Last Caress&quot;, &quot;Am I Evil?&quot;, and &quot;Seek &amp; Destroy&quot; are performed as encores. I especially dig the &quot;Kill 'Em All/Ride the Lightning&quot; medley, that consists of &quot;Fight Fire with Fire (1984)&quot;, and Metallica's first song &quot;Hit the Lights (1981).&quot; This video is a great buy, and the DVD format must be of greater quality, but hey VHS does the trick for me. Fans of early Metallica, the &quot;Black album&quot;, and the singles released from &quot;Load&quot;, will enjoy every minute of this stellar 1997 concert performance.
0671027344|5.0|An excellent book that really captures the audience and shows what it is like to be a teenager on the edge of being an adult.  Through the letters to an unknown friend, we learn all the trials and experiences Charlie must go through in order to become a grown man.  Charlie is indeed a wallflower, which is said to be someone who sees things, keeps quiet about them, and understands.  From meeting a homosexual friend, smoking cigarettes, falling in love for the first time, and having a couple breakdowns, we reminisce in how it is to be a teenager in high school.  Through this book you can relate your own life's similarities and differences.  It is a book that makes it so you can't put it down, and kept me reading for hours on end.
6305633177|5.0|This 90 minute DVD (or VHS) is a great look at the &quot;old Metallica&quot;, before they began to slide in 1996, with the release of the mediocre &quot;Load&quot; album. I actually purchased this tape during the &quot;ReLoad&quot; era, and was blown away by the raw energy of their early live shows, and Cliff Burton's &quot;Hendrix-style&quot; bass pyro-technics. The tracks &quot;Creeping Death&quot;, &quot;Fade to Black&quot;, &quot;Sanitarium&quot;, and &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; are worth the $20 alone you will pay for this collection. The other tunes are recorded a bit less professionally, but the sound quality is decent. &quot;Dave Mustaine (former-Megadeth)&quot; is featured on lead guitar on one song, and Cliff Burton's 2nd gig ever is captured on film as well. If you love the recordings &quot;Kill 'Em All&quot;, &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot;, &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, and &quot;Garage Days 1984&quot;, then this rare glimpse of early Metallica is a great purchase. Hey, also check out <BR>&quot;Live Sh*t (DVD version)(2002)&quot;, &quot;Cunning Stunts (1998)&quot;, and &quot;The Making of the Black Album (2001 documentary).&quot;<BR>&quot;Live Sh*t&quot; is by far Metallica's best live release. Every hit single, cover song, and fan favorite is featured.
B000008LOV|4.0|Is this the ultimate supergroup?  It very well may be.  These five guys, who need no introduction, work very well together.  You can tell they had a blast recording this album.  It's just a really fun album that fans of any of these guys will enjoy.
B000002N3J|5.0|I remember first buying this cd the very first day it was release. back in 11/95..  Its a very well put toghether collection. All old and new,remasterd tracks are good. I will dis agree with music fan from spain states that (crazy for you) is the worst tracks, that is her most immature sounding track how dare you, That is a very hard song to sing, she did good with her voice at the time. and took it to #1 in the U.S If Mariah or Whitney even Celine Dion were to do a remake or anything it would be a disaster. This a 3 million seller in the U.S  for anyones info. and its worth it..
B000002B1M|5.0|This has to be Nas's best cd ever, and it is essential to a hip hop collection.  His beats are phat, and he mixes old school and new school throughout the cd. Memory Lane has to be one of his best songs w/ the phat beat, and layin down mad rhymes. If u don't have this cd go get it because its one of the best ever
B00008S2VG|5.0|Im sorry that some here do not agree. American Life is a killer album, I just wanted to say for the record, Atleast It open at #1 selling over 5 million world wide still rising, U.S sales may have been slow but she's platinum selling over a million. Thats what really matters atleast still being certified. Since the beginning. Madonna has proved that. Its not her fault sales are slow, its the radio stations, Hollywood and nothing fails are for sure radio hits, I was at a club last sunday I heard nobady knows me mix it rocks....  anyway this is a must album to have for true understanding madonna fans.......
B0000041Q3|5.0|This is the ultimate Turandot! The best one to buy! Forget the Katia Ricciarelli/Placido Domingo/Herbert Von Karajan recording! That one is the absolute worst! But this one is even better because here you could hear absolutely everything that the orchestra, chorus, and singers etc. needs. Thank god this is not Karajan conducting because if he were conducting this recording he would omit every single rhythmic aspect that this opera needs! Thank you, Zubin Mehta, for bashing Karajan out of the recording booth. Zubin Mehta is the best conductor for Puccini's Turandot and he brings out every single hidden texture that's in there! Never before has Puccini's Turandot ever been conducted like this, not even by Erich Leinsdorf or Francesco Molinari-Pradelli, and definitely not Karajan. Joan Sutherland has a very majestic voice! Some of you reviewers say that Birgit Nilsson is better! Well, Joan Sutherland is just as good as Birgit Nilsson is as Turandot. And Luciano Pavarotti, he's got the greatest Calaf voice on record. He sings like no other tenor would sing this role and he bashes down the opera house with it. His voice could tie up with Placido Domingo and Jose Carreras on their Tuarndot recordings. The chorus here is like no other, it is definitely the chorus that Toscanini used in his world premiere, The John Alldis Choir. Everybody in the chorus really sings out their lines unlike any other chorus would. Turandot has never been better conducted or better sung than this one. Sir Georg Solti should've conducted that Deutsche Grammophon recording. His rhythm is so loud that it could totally break any stereo player if it's in full volume. Karajan acts like a total wimp in his recording of this same opera and no wonder it didn't get any Grammy Awards. This Turandot recording on the Decca label is gonna get a grammy soon enough for best recorded rhythm on a recording:gongs, thunderdrums, every orchestral textures. You can always count on Zubin Mehta for the most perfect rhythm ever! Too bad there's no Madama Butterfly recording with him conducting.
B000089RVR|5.0|On her first album, Dido told us she was No Angel... Yeah, right, after that album, and Life For Rent, we sure don't believe it! Well, at least I don't! :) <BR>The album is amazing, from the first one all the way to the last one! <BR>The first song on the album, White Flag (also the first single) is an azaing one, really, so are Life For Rent and Don't Leave Home (in my humble opinion :)). My favorite song is the already mentioned White Flag, because it's beautfigul lyrics and great melody, graced with Dido's awesome voice! <BR>What can I say, Dido is definately the whole package, and so is her CD! Rock on, girl! :)
0345451325|5.0|In this book it talks about what happened before HALO. The Master Chief is a boy and he is abducted at the age of six. he is put through a grueling training,and was surgically altered. then he recived the mjolnir battle suit. he meets cortana and is fitted into the best suit ever made. this book was the best book i've read in a while. because i'm in R.O.T.C. I understand alot of the military words that are used, like LZ or landing zone.
B0000AUHPK|5.0|Finally, a version of Wuthering Heights that faithfully follows the book.  While I cast no aspertions on the 1939 version, which did offer Oliver in an excellent portrayal, that film cannot compare to the more honest scenario & acting offered by Finnes & Binoche in the 1992 film.  Undoubtedly (in my opinion) closer to what Bronte originally wanted the story to \\"feel\\" like.

B000068GA4|5.0|I bought this album after i saw the video of mother on mtv or vh1, whatever. I'd heard that song many times before, but had never thought of trying out one of his cds, so I decided to buy Danzig - the first one. The first Danzig album is almost as good as this one, but not quite. This cd is such an incredible mixture of basic rock, blues, and metal. Danzig has one of the coolest voices I've ever heard; it sounds like a mix of Jim Morrison and Elvis Presley. Buy this album along with the first one. Best songs are: Devil's Plaything, Blood and Tears, Killer Wolf, I'm the one, 777, i'm not even going to keep listing songs because every song on this album is great.

THIS MOVIE IS BORING, NOT SCARRY, AND GORY AS HELL. GOOD NAKED SCENES THOUGH.....WHAT? I'M A GUY AREN'T I?
B000068G9X|5.0|I've already written a review for Danzig II, so this review will be concise. Every album on this song is great, Danzig's voice is awesome. This cd is really pretty much equal with Danzig II, but who cares buy both.
B0000AFX64|3.0|Just an FYI to anyone considering this....buy the series DVD's and skip this DVD, as it's just the fullscreen version reedited....they just blacked out the top and bottom just like they did with it's prior iteration.....and it's MONO.....at least the series version of this story is 5.1, and is not very different from the movie.<br />Skip it unless you're passing on the series, and don't mind fullscreen copy with black bars.
0385504209|4.0|Though this novel won't go down as a classic of modern literature, this bestseller is a surprisingly good read.  The pacing reminded me of \\"The Firm\\", one of those rare books that draws you in from the start and keeps up the suspense (and the reader into the late hours of the night).<br />The beauty of The DaVinci Code is that not only does it provide suspense, but it also causes readers to analyze theology, art, architecture, history and organized religion.  Even though the book is obviously fiction and undoubtedly takes liberties with its subject matter, this book will get your mind going.  I would bet that online images of DaVinci's \\"The Last Supper\\" have gotten quite a few looks over the last year.  I know that I took a second look at several of his works and did some online research while reading this book.<br />Please note that Brown puts forth many ideas in The DaVinci Code that are contrary to established religious doctrine.  If you are leery of any writing that introduces mythology, secret societies and pagan belief systems, then this is not a book for you.  I am sure that this book receives many negative reviews solely based on a reader's disagreement with the subject matter.  Remember that this is just an intriguing work of fiction, approach it with an open mind and I think you will enjoy it.<br />There are several negatives to point out.  The protagonists are Robert Langdon, an American symbologist and Sophie Neveu, a French cryptologist.  That is about all you need to know about them because character development was sacrificed in the interests of maintaining the action and suspense.  Unfortunately, the characters are used only to drive the plot and introduce the ideas/puzzles that make this book so unique.  A bizarre murder forces them to race across Paris and England to unlock the clues to a mystery that has existed for centuries.  Along the way, they must withstand vigorous pursuit from the French police, rogue members of an ultra-conservative Catholic sect and other mysterious antagonists.  I must say that there were a few times during their adventure that I had to \\"willingly suspend my disbelief\\" a little more than I might for most novels. Also, I found that there were several predictable moments in the story.  But for me, the biggest disappointment was chapter 105, when Robert invites Sophie to Florence. Gag... Brown did nothing with the characters along the way to make this relationship believable but story-telling convention required him to have the male and female protagonists romantically attached.<br />Despite its weaknesses, The DaVinci Code is an entertaining read deserving of its continued bestseller status.  This book goes beyond the traditional thriller and gets readers to think about the world around them, though definitely not in a way that the Vatican would approve!holic sect and other mysterious antagonists.

B000002KBU|5.0|When great albums are tossed around in conversation, one often hears Beatles, Stones, or Dylan albums, but often left out is the work of THE premier chanteuse of the '70's: Joni Mitchell. With certain bands (Radiohead), it takes a few albums to really realize the full scope of the artist's musical genius, but that can be done in one fell swoop with &quot;Blue.&quot; Simply stated, her 1971 recording is an arguably unrivaled piece of introspective musical poetry. Sure, it lacks the multi-piece completeness of her later efforts, and generally operates between two musical &quot;feels&quot; (the care-free &quot;Carey&quot; and the heartbreaking &quot;Blue&quot; make that case), but what's wrong with a piano, a guitar, and a masterful songwriter that knows how to get each and every song under your skin? &quot;Blue&quot; may not have a full orchestra behind it, but many of the songs are as violently moving as a Mozart opera.<br />What is so intriguing about &quot;Blue&quot; is that, for the most part, each and every song is increasingly better than the one before it. The overall effect is astounding.<BR>-The opener, &quot;All I Want,&quot; isn't BAD, per se, but it certainly is the lowest point in the whole album.<BR>-&quot;My Old Man&quot; has its own charm, but it certainly pales in comparison to the tracks that follow it.<BR>-&quot;Little Green&quot; is truly the first great song of the album. Stunning in its simplicity, it tells an inspiring story that resonates on many levels.<BR>-&quot;Carey&quot; is the favorite song for many lovers of &quot;Blue,&quot; an airy, driving tune.<BR>-&quot;Blue,&quot; the title song, is the emotional low point of the album, not in quality, but in how depressing it is. Mitchell brings a compelling vision to a color that represents so many things in life.<BR>-&quot;California&quot; and &quot;This Flight Tonight&quot; are both light, catchy tunes, but &quot;California&quot; trumps &quot;Flight&quot; with its sense of humor.<BR>-&quot;River&quot; and &quot;A Case of You&quot; are both extremely moving, the latter belonging in the handful of her best songs. Few love songs get better or more heartfelt than &quot;A Case of You.&quot;<BR>-True to the trend, the closer, &quot;The Last Time I Saw Richard,&quot; represents Mitchell at her peak both in the album and in her creative career. &quot;Richard&quot; could be her best song of all time, and it puts up a pretty convincing argument as it lyrically dissects opposing views on love and arrives at a chilling but beautiful conclusion. It says so much about Mitchell as an artist. She sings so much about love and disappointment, and this song captures both of those so well. It's an &quot;Anti-Love&quot; song if there ever was one, but Mitchell proves that even those kinds of songs can have the emotional depth of &quot;A Case of You.&quot; It's so beautiful, it's really hard to listen to. You can't miss it, though.<br />If there exists one reason to buy &quot;Blue,&quot; it is the album's closer, &quot;The Last Time I Saw Richard.&quot; Thankfully, though, there are ten reasons: every single song on the album. &quot;Blue&quot; is a perfect example of poetry and music at their most compelling, most moving, most personal, and their best.
B00003CXA4|5.0|I'd like to say, this film is probably one of my top 10 favorites. Very well scripted, and very well directed, same goes for the soundtrack to it as well. Though that's the only problem I have, why can't these greedy record companies re-release the soundtrack on cd for myself to spend 15-25 dollars on, instead of having to buy a used LP at some record shop and have to buy a record player for myself to be able to listen to it.<br />Hey, I got a message for you RIAA, why don't you re-release this score and you'll score yourself some cash of mine, and we'll both be happy, agreed? While your at it, why don't you re-release the soundtrack to 'Mobsters' as well. Maybe if these cds were available to buy, people wouldn't feel the need to download them from the internet!<br />Later
B0000AXE8I|4.0|The Matrix movie always had that feel of intrigue. It was the one cool action movie that had the most intriguing plot.Unfortunately, The Matrix Reloaded does not cut it the same way. Most of it's plot is fairly interesting, not as intriguing as the first Matrix but fair enough.There are many scenes that were maybe somewhat unnecessary like the Zion scene(which i would've cut in half) or the agent smith scene(which gets boring after a while).I believe the movie tries to astonish people with its special effects(car chase,smith agents) and leaves the plot out a little. Nevertheless it still a good movie. The scenes with the Oracle and The Architect were pretty interesting. I believe the ending of this movie its what makes it worth it. The movie, in my opinion talks about how destiny can actually be avoided, which foreshadows that the humans will resist in the end.It was a &quot;transition movie&quot; so it was basically paving the way for revolutions. It is a good buy on DVD because its special effects and some of its philosphical intrigue is still there. This one lives up to the matrix, but does not add much more to it.I give it four stars
0345350499|4.0|Morgaine is probably one of the best female characters that I've read (Only Pride &amp; Predjudice's Liz Bennett sticks out in my mind more). Morgaine has attitude but can show her sensitive side. The Church vs. Goddess worship theme did get old (which is the only reason it didn't get a five). But I guess even that was a sub-theme of the idea of a world going through change and the accounts of those who doesn't want that change and the suffering that results.
B000002UVX|5.0|On the album, Jimi played unrestrained, uninhibited and ultimately squeezed out every ounced of musical genius he had and let his guitar sing.<br />Get the album! <br />If you want to hear pure rock guitar genius at work, Jimi will astound you again, and again with every movement of his fingers on the strings. <br />The rhythm section, bass and drums, is solid, rock solid. Jimi feeds on this solid rhythm to create his tapestry of guitar music weaved with melodic wah. <br />Wah-wah comes like pure cool water on a hot day. Jimi paints the walls of sound with master strokes, using foot and fingers. <br />His fingers running through the guitars will strike you like lightning! Jimi reaffirms that with the power of love for his music he can do anything with his guitar, music-wise and more!  <BR>        <BR>This compilation is original rock guitar music that is imitated by everybody, never to be recreated again.<br />If you think Jimi Hendrix doesn't deserve to be number one,  this album will surely convince you that Jimi Hendrix is the master, the best, the top god of rock guitar. <br />P.S. The remastering is great. Credits goes to the remaster engineers for bringing out the best of Jimi's music.
0385504209|5.0|This book is everything a good novel should be. It's smart, beautifully written, paced with amazing precision, filled with action and bursting at the seams with religious insight and theories that have rarely seen such public attention. Although the latter is heavily borrowed from other source, Brown presents them in a story that compells you to pay attention through a page turning plot and full, dynamic characters.  Brown's novel hits the ground running from the first page and draws you into the mystery of an ancient society and the secrets they were charged to keep.  Throughout the story the main characters are struggling against time to decode the multiple messages left for them by the recently murdered curator of the Louvre. One of the great aspect of the novel is the reader own involvement to solve the riddles and codes. You are constantly toying with your own ideas of what the solutions could be. Most of the obstacles in The Da Vinci Code have solutions far beyond traditional logic and crytological methods. In fact, the relation of the answers to the character is one of the things that endears readers to the main characters of this novel. A few of the riddles are actually so easy that they discredit the characters (The bank code? Come on) but this is certainly very rare.  Brown gracefully treads a fine line between fact and conjecture by constantly enforcing the fact that while the arguments in the book are extremely persuasive, they are arguments made by characters who firmly believe in what they are searching for. Truly and amazing book.
0385504209|5.0|I read this book back in July.  It peaked my interest so much that I took a trip to France and Italy in September to look at the things mentioned in the book.  I was in awe seeing the paintings by Leonardo, for the first time. You come away feeling that you have learned something. Not many novels do that.<br />After this book, I read all his previous ones.  And I highly recommend them, especially &quot;Angels &amp; Demons&quot;, another exellent Robert Langdon's adventure, which inspired me to travel to Italy to see the Vatican for myself.<br />I can't wait for his new book.
B000099T2L|4.0|Well I dont have much to say about this cd, beside I LOVE THE SONG ''BABY BOY''!!!!! Beyonce is really talented and you put Sean Paul in the song....well yeah buddy!! I love the beat of this song! This is one of those songs that makes you want to get up and dance:)
B00008S2VG|4.0|I was eagerly anticipating this album, as most of Madonna's die-hard fans were, and unlike most others, I was not disappointed. On this album, Mrs.Ritchie shows a emotional depth and musical growth not heard since her masterpiece, Like a Prayer. I am not a fan of the 1st single, American Life. The only interesting thing she does is a rap which I found very funny and an obvious attempt to mock her fame and s called &quot;benefits&quot; of celebrity. Hollywood never jumped out at me and all these months later, it still doesn't. I'm So Stupid is a great song that shows how Madonna feels a sense of not knowing the Madonna in jelly bracelets, or the woman who fellated a bottle in Truth or Dare. Love Profusion is a fantastic song that is interspersed with some of the teachings she has learned from the Kabbalah. Nobody Knows Me is the standout track on the cd and I have heard some great remixes in nightclubs. Nothing Fails is haunting and the choir at the end still gives me chills. Intervention and X-Static Process are love songs for the new millenium. Mother and Father shows Madonna dealing with the very obvious conflicted relationship she had with her father. Die Another Day is not, contrary to what Sir Elton John says, the worst Bond song ever. However, it doesn't fit in with the context of the stories she is telling on American Life. Easy Ride has a great laid back feel and is a perfect ending to the cd. Overall, I am still listening to American Life and I love the quailty of the music overall. I will say that I am waiting to see what this woman has up her sleeve next. I would like to see a return to the Madonna of old, whose music beckoned you to the dance floor and allowed you to escape the mundane. Maybe we can all hope for that box set celebrating her 20 year anniversary to do the trick!
B0000DBJDM|5.0|Hip-O Records presents &quot;Pink Floyd:Live at Pompeii&quot;, from the concert featuring original cues from the legendary foursome performing classic originals.  Sit back and enjoy the classic performances by one of the great performers of our time.<br />Entire concert is a standout with the magnum opus &quot;A SAUCEFUL OF SECRETS&quot;, &quot;CAREFUL WITH THAT AXE EUGENE&quot; and &quot;SET THE CONTROLS FOR THE HEART OF THE SUN&quot;.  A few of these &quot;live&quot; renditions are better than their studio predecessors, such as the two part &quot;ECHOES PART II&quot; ~ and the puzzling &quot;MADEMOISELLE NOBS&quot;.  This is one of those great things about concert films ~ it allows a band to see how they come off visually, and gives them a chance to improve their appeal. Only with &quot;At Pompeii,&quot; Pink Floyd takes that mirror-element and uses it to further display their innovations in music.<br />Hats off to Adrian Maben (director), Universal Music and all the staff who had a hand in bringing this to the fans.  A must have for all who have followed the careers of each musician that we know as PINK FLOYD!<br />Total Time: 171 mins ~ Universal Music B0001315 ~ (10/21/2003)
6305327084|5.0|I love this movie in oh so many ways, most of which are much too subtle for me to express in my current state. But I just had to respond, at least, to all these reviews saying this takes place in the Midwest or Minnesota.  Where are you getting this from?  Willie leaves the Port Authority Bus Terminal in NYC - telling his boss his bus trip is 5 or 6 hours.  And in the bar, Paul talks about the guys in the bar who go to The Cape for 2 weeks out of every summer.  Sorry folks - this takes place somewhere in Central Mass.  In fact, I think I actually read that somewhere anyway.  A great film - great acting - I disagree with all the criticisms - but I won't go into them all now.
B000002UB6|5.0|What's all the big 'ol huffy about?  Wasn't it all because the four weren't getting along with each other any longer, that they couldn't sit down with Martin and mix this album down without wearing on each other's nerves?  Were there too many egos in the way here?  And was it Martin or the execs at Capitol/EMI that &quot;asked&quot; Spector to remix?  Yeah, the guy is a bit of a loon...a crack-pot, some might say...and alot of questions about his &quot;current&quot; problems &amp; demons, but I'm sure the guy didn't just force his way into the control room and DEMAND to mix it down, did he?  And, at least the goon used REAL orchestras and FULL arrangements to complete the production, right?  That's a whole heck of alot more than producers are using to churn out todays's over-homoginized, extremely pasturized, synthetic pop sound!  Gag!  What Spector did way back then, is now history.  For I am not opposed to the upcoming stripped-down version...I'm sure it'll probably give us some light on just how it was &quot;supposed&quot; to sound...but just give the old strung-out guy some credit, where it's rightly due, that's all.  One more thing...was this &quot;stripped&quot; version just &quot;recently&quot; created by layering out Spector's techniques?  Hmmmm, if so...sorry guys...you're missing two important links to &quot;o'kay&quot; this final mix, aren't we!
B00006LI4S|5.0|The real talent behind Pink Floyd?  You be the judge.  Everyone seems to give Roger Waters the nod.  And I'm not here to take anything away from Waters.  He is a very talented lyricist, and was definitely a very bold, creative force behind the huge success of Pink Floyd.  But watching this DVD, and seeing Gilmour do what he does with those guitars of his, and hearing his effortlessly recreated renditions of some classic Floyd tunes, tells me that at least musically this is the person responsible for the band's popularity.  He is a fantastic guitarist and is responsible for writing and playing some of my favorite songs of all time (i.e. Shine On, Comfortably Numb, Wish You Were Here, etc.)  I have to admit that it is a bit disconcerting to see David Gilmour looking more like your dad than the Rock and Roll Guitar God that he is.  But as soon as you hear him strum those familiar tunes, and hear that soothing voice of his, it doesn't matter.  I agree with the previous reviewer though ... he could have dressed a little more for the occasion.  But the bottom line is, he knew that he didn't need to.  Once the first note was played no one would be paying any attention to anything else anyway.  Although laid back, this is a great DVD and full of some great music.  If I lost it I would buy it again.

B00005R2M3|1.0|Ok, this CD is awful! It was given to me as a birthday present and I never had heard of her so I gave it a try and listened to it, and after hearing an entire minute of the first song... I immediately stopped my CD player and took this piece of garbage out. This sucks! I couldn't stand listening to it, mainly because of her awful annoying unattractive voice! she sounds nothing like how she looks. You'd expect her to have a nice sexy, soothing, pretty voice, but sadly she doesn't possess that. someone should put a muzzle on her, seriously. Don't waste your money on this crap. She may have looks, though evidently doesn't have the voice to match!

0385504209|5.0|I picked up this book at an airport as something to bide the time while I was sitting in a plane.  What a great find.  It held my interest completely.  From beginning to end - it would not let me put it down!  I highly recommend this novel!!
B0000AFQS0|5.0|The 24-year wait is over!  After first hearing the TKAA soundtrack in 1979, I immediately purchased a copy and played it over and over until the stylus on the turntable required replacement.  When I finally saw the \\"rockumentary\\" (in the fall of 1979), the dramatic onslaught of live and TV performances left me speechless.<br />Now, after years of playing the VHS version of TKAA, the release of the special edition DVD is extremely satisfying to watch.  The packaging is first rate and the booklet provides details into the making of the film as well as the location and date of every interview, appearance, and concert footage.  Watching Ringo attempting to interview Keith while drinking their \\"medicine\\" is a pure gem.  The isolated tracks of the Ox on reel two are mesmerizing and leave no doubt who the \\"fastest bass player in the west\\" was.<br />The long wait is now over and the restored version was worth the wait.  As Keith Richards says before 'A Quick One, While He's Away', \\"And now ladies and gentlemen, dig The Who\\".
B00006AUIG|5.0|Danvers Mental Hospital, built in the mid-1870s, now sits empty on a hill in Massachusetts, closed since 1985.  The Hazmat Evacuation Company underbids other crews to clean up the asbestos that can be found all over the asylum.  The team members: Mike (played by Stephen Gevedon, one of the film's writers) finds a series of taped sessions in the basement.  Henry (Josh Lucas) discovers hidden treasure in the tunnels beneath the asylum.  Jeff (Brendon Sexton III) struggles with his fear of the dark.  Phil (David Caruso) tries to keep the crew working as a team.  The team leader, Gordon (Peter Mullan), longs to return to his wife and child.<br />As the team begins to work, the eerie building begins to work on them.<br />This is a surprising thriller.  It doesn't rely on special effects to creep out the viewers.  It's all done with lighting, with story, and the use of a video camera instead of a big, bulky movie camera.  You feel that you're right there with the team, working in that immense building.  (A good example is when Henry is walking back alone from the tunnels, up a staircase that is divided by a gate for staff on one side and patients on the other.  The camera work and editing make this a genuinely creepy scene.)  When the team is told some of the sordid history of the asylum, that lends to the fear that both the actors and the viewers sense.<br />All the actors give fine performances.  That, coupled with a great script and great directing, make for one of the scarier thrillers to be made in a long time.<br />The DVD picture and sound quality are fantastic.  Plus, the extras are definitely worth watching: a featurette on the Danvers Mental Hospital (a real place in Massachusetts), audio commentary, deleted scenes, story-to-screen with commentary.  This is a creepy and atmospheric thriller that deserved much better at the box office.
B00008X5J5|4.0|This was never one of my favorites, though I've come to appreciate it. I won't consider this a definite classic like The Little Mermaid or The Lion King, but it's up there.<br />I thought that Aurora's voice is a bit too womanly for her, certainly very different from the singing voices of the other princesses. And I know this is going to sound strange, but it just felt to me that Aurora and Phillip's relationship wasn't very developed. I mean, it's a Disney...but at least the other movies had more interaction between the characters, even though it was love at first sight. In this respect, Sleeping Beauty falls in with Snow White and Cinderella.<br />But overall, the movie was very entertaining...I loved the scene between King Stephen and Phillip's father, when they were drunk. And the three fairies are so adorable! I didn't realize till I watched this again that Maleficent also had a sense of humor when she captured the prince and told him that he would be released in a 100 years.<br />Families will definitely enjoy this movie.
B00000G3Q4|5.0|A must see for all horror fans...and maybe some others too. Not as slapstick as the second and third, but with it's share of dark humor, Evil Dead is a highly entertaining movie! Bruce Campbell is a joy, as usual, and the over-the-top gore effects are even more pervasive here than in the others. Those who don't enjoy buckets and buckets of blood may want to steer clear, but as for the rest of you, enjoy!!!
B00005JKC3|4.0|I thought it was a good movie because I understand how much of a task it was to bring the hulk to life.  Your average movie buff doesn't really understand the time consuming process of 3D modeling, texturing, and animation.  <BR>Also, refering to the review a few up about how could the hulk could jump around like that, well the hulk can jump 100ft in the air.  Just read the comics.  He jumps over 100ft in the air and he picks up items that are bigger than tanks.  Which I think is the whole problem.  People are watching this movie with tv series in mind and not what the character is in which marvel intended.
B000060MMI|5.0|This is undoubtedly the best CD I have ever bought. I am a big fan of Irish rock/punk but this band puts them all to shame. From the kickin' &quot;Rebels of the sacred heart&quot; to the introspective &quot;What's left of the flag,&quot; this album includes both deep lyrics and incredible instrumentals. Any fan of punk rock or Irish rock should own and treasure this CD.
B000002BBY|5.0|\\"(What's The History) Morning Glory?\\" is definitely the ultimate rock'n'roll record of the 90's. This outstanding piece of art made by the genius Noel Gallagher shows you the best of British rock, not shown with so much grace and style since The Beatles.  A huge sucess has taken control of radios all over the world with classics such as \\"Wonderwall\\" and \\"Don't Look Back In Anger\\" - songs kept alive until today unlike so many other bands that, after their great sucess, have sunk into oblivion. Named many times as one of the greatest records of all times, this CD can show you the extremes, ranging from the harmony between acoustic guitars coupled with the fine orchestra in \\"Cast No Shadow\\" and the loud and heavy guitars that blow you away in \\"Hello\\" or \\"Morning Glory.\\" Another song that stands out is undoubtbly \\"Champagne Supernova\\", an anthem with more than seven minutes that managed to break into radio stations, even without being a single -another classic tune loaded with guitar solos in perfect balance. All in all, \\"(What's The History) Morning Glory?\\" is an essencial record for anyone who claims to love the art of rock'n'roll. Maybe you're not a fan of the modesty and politeness of the Gallagher brothers, but you've got to admit it: they certanly know how to make excellent music.
B00005JM02|5.0|This movie was AWESOME!  A great movie for kids and adults! It was hilarious, man!!!
B0000C0FJB|3.0|I wrote an earlier review where I gave 5 stars to this cd.  I was caught up in the excitement of a new RUSH release along with the DVD.  But after multiple listenings to the cd, and viewings of the \\"Rush in Rio\\" DVD, I'm downgrading this cd to only 3 stars.  This is sad, because I've been a RUSH fan since the summer of '76 when I recorded \\"All the World's a Stage\\" from a neighbor, plus seeing them live for every tour beginning with \\"A Farewell to Kings,\\" sometimes twice.  So, I think my RUSH credentials are well established.  The first reason for downgrading the cd is the bad sound quality mentioned in well stated detail by other reviewers.  I had to go back to the previous live projects, which all stand up well - especially compared to other bands' releases of the same time period.  This is bad.  Very bad.  Even though RUSH admit the recording equipment was primitive for this venture, technology - of which RUSH are not unfamiliar with - should have been better utilized.  I have a board bootleg of the \\"Permanent Waves\\" tour and the sound there is tremendous, especially on \\"By-tor and the Snowdog.\\"  And this is completely analog - reel to reel.  \\"Exit... Stage Left\\", \\"A Show of Hands\\" and \\"Different Stages\\" are all top form.  RiR really fails to meet the usual RUSH standards.  The next complaint is even less objective than my opinion of the sound quality.  I just get soooo tired of Neal and his anti-fan, anti-social, pro-Ayn Rand, whining.  This really becomes clear in the Documentary portion on Disc 2 of the DVD (He also reveals more of this character in his two books:  \\"The Masked Rider\\" and \\"Ghost Rider\\").  I'm not as concerned about Neal's, or the band's politics, philosophy, etc., however I'd like to think it important that there exist a give-and-take attitude with an artist, their emotional excerise in song writing and their audience.  Neal seems to miss this connection completely.  He expresses his emotions through the band's music or his writing, but he doesn't care to encounter fans at an airport terminal?  Take my money and treat me like crap to boot, Mr. Peart.  His writing has always grown and matured over the years, the tragic and positive events of his recent past have been touching, bittersweet, and uplifting.  But based on his own documented statements - or Geddy's and Alex's in his place - I realize he care's little for anyone elses, especially those of us who, listen to, purchase and/or see in concert.  Very arrogant of Mr. Peart.  Some fans are a pain, I'm sure.  However, to think that all fans want a piece of him is rude.  To write a song about it - \\"Limelight\\" is just wrong.  I would like to see and know more of the influences which go into creating a song by these guys.  Alex and Geddy are very personable, and in one or two segments Neal appears demi-human, but his not a person I'd would shoot the sh.. with after mowing the lawn on a Saturday afternoon.  I won't fawn over RUSH or think them better or worse than any other human, or Canadian, but I am interested in what it takes to create a great album like \\"Vapor Trails\\" - with all the emotional history the songs on this cd contain - or put together a tour.  But to Mr. Peart, if I do every encounter him, I promise I won't step into his Limelight (the most self-righteous song I've ever heard).  Again, to Mr. Neal, I too, and many others, have lost those who we should outlive.  But I won't boohoo over his loss too much.  I can't help it, but Neal Peart's attitude just gets in the way of any future songs because he's revealed himself to be a selfish egotist and hidden the person who I might care about.  Geddy and Alex shouldn't be expected to cover for Neal, which they tend to do.  Some fans idolize artists, some just want an autograph or photo, and some would like nothing better than to \\"spend and evening with a drink and a friend\\" whether their old or new.  It goes against logic that RUSH's music is effected negatively by one artist's exclusion of his fans.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|I was blown away initially by the first episode of this film. The characters were very well done, the fight scenes, and technologies were first rate. Neo was just learning about his powers. The second film just seemed to make a mockery of this and Neo should of been able to beat hell out of just about every one. Agent smith was a bore, however Hugo weaving was great in his role I believe his talent was severely hindered by the plot. The long winded speeches and hypothesizing was extremely wasteful, if the filmakers were short of story they might have made the movie shorter instead of padding it with cr$p! To cut a long story short I just hope that revolutions redeems those who work so hard at making sense of the cr*p they are dealt.
B000089RVR|5.0|Like many reviewers here, I wrote a half-hearted review the day I got this CD and listened, unimpressed, unmoved. But Because I spent $20 (AUS) on it, I kept it in my player and played it whenever I could and like Radiohead, or other subtly brilliant muscians, this CD has grown on me. Each time I listen to it another thread is woven in Dido's amazing musical tapestry.<BR>White Flag is one of my least favorite songs now because it is too different and seems out of place among the smooth, volitile tunes of the others. Standout tunes include Don't Leave Home, Who makes you feel, and the hidden track (after See the Sun). Sand in My Shoes is just wonderful. Since No Angel, Dido has grown and evolved and I guess we'll be getting a lot of great material from this talented artist for a long time to come.
0446530891|2.0|As a fan of David Baldacci, I looked forward to this book after ordering it from Amazon.  The premise was fine, but there was no real character development, there was at least one embarrassing lapse in logic (spoiler warning:  when the agents suspected Jorst had hidden the gun, they never thought it through with regard to the two women who were killed), and the end was way, way too far-fetched.  Like another reviewer said, the villain was an impossible cartoon, and worse, his motivation for doing all that he did was just lame.  I won't even be lending this book to anybody.
B00009P1O0|5.0|About 20 years ago, I found several of Neils's albums in the &quot;bargain bin&quot; of the record store. They were all about 3 or 4 dollars, and turned out to be some of the best deals I've ever gotten from the cheap section of the record store. This was just when CDs were starting to gain momentum.<BR>I preceded to pick up all of the 4 that have been recently reissued, as well as &quot;Time Fades away&quot; and &quot;Tonight's the Night&quot; for about $20 dollars. You see, I was hesitant to invest in a &quot;new&quot; technology (CDs)when you could only buy the 1983 list of the top albums of the last 5 years or so (a stellar list that included Michael Jeckson, Madonna, Bruce, etc.,). I figured I would tape the album, leave it untouched in it's jacket, and just wait for the more obscure titles to make it onto CD. <BR>I finally broke down in 1989 and bout a CD player and managed to slowly replace the important LPs from my collection. I figured there just HAS to be a copy of &quot;On the Beach&quot; out there - import, bootleg - SOMETHING! <BR>Now my old LPs currently reside in a closet at my parent's house in mint condition (too difficult to transport) and the only cassette tape I had had been borrowed by a former room mate and never returned. I was beginning to lose hope.<br />Imagine my shock to read that Neil was finally releasing OTB (and the others) on CD. I bought this one specifically first, since I still occasionly had &quot;Revolution Blues&quot; running through my head and no way to satisfy that itch... until now.<BR>Thanks Neil, for not being so principled that you felt you had to wait for a comparable technology to the analog versions.<BR>Now if you could do something about &quot;Time Fades Away&quot;...
B0000AXE8I|4.0|the Matrix Reloaded is more than 2 howers of trick photography and live action! The story it's self is not as strong as Matrix 1, but all the action makes up for that. The ending is kind of a puzzle, I hope it is explained better in the next movie.<br />One of my favorite events in the movie takes place on a crowded Sanfrancisco freeway when Trinity, amd Morphius are trying to rescue The Keymaker and escape agents. You have agents jumping from car to car, Trinity hijacks a motorcycle from a movimg 18 weeler and pilots it through the crowded fast moving trafic!<br />Morphius fights an agent ontop of a moving 18 weeler!
B00005YW4H|4.0|I'm not sure if this deserved 8 grammys, or that it should still be a top Amazon seller after almost 2 years out, but it is very good. I'd imagine alot of it's success came from being one of few releases of it's kind to get much exposure recently. People do want a change from the same generic radio songs, and this is a nice one. Each track is nice and easy, piano, acoustic guitar, light drums, and has a jazzy feeling, without really being jazz. I really do like her voice too. It's scratchy but smooth, and very sexy. So, I'm not sure if it's the album of 2002, but it is 14 cool tracks that sound as good as she looks.
B00005JLYW|3.0|this movie is realy not a sequal to Charlie's Angles; it does have more acltion and a deeper plot, the movie just doesn't have that cuteness the first one did. It the same kind of multilayer plot as in a Mission Imposible movie, and the main villan is a former Charlie's Angles operative.<br />My favorite sequence in the film is the motorcross! It's a combination of free style and dirt bike raceing, they make it look like there are 100 motercycles on the track at the same time going different directions and doing big tricks in a no holds bared, fight to win, race!
B000000W6F|4.0|Man I'm glad this came out when it did. I remember hearing &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; for the first time, and knowing at that moment they would become a favorite band. It was released in the heart of the alt-grunge movement, but to me it's alot more special than some of the other cd's of the time. &quot;Gish&quot; was an alternative, and it had the grunge vibe, but it also had a darkness to it, much like &quot;Nine Inch Nails&quot; or &quot;The Cure&quot;, but without being industrial or goth. Another thing that turned me on about them, was that they could rock your socks off on one track, and sing you a lulluby on the next, and sometimes in the same song. Casual fans might go for the &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, but this is worth it just for the songs &quot;I Am One&quot; and &quot;Tristessa&quot;. All around a great album, and excellent October listening.
B0000AUHOH|4.0|Star Trek V is a very good film.  Shatner has taken much abuse over it, but I believe the fault (then &amp; now) lies with Paramount.  The Star Trek films have been their biggest property, and yet if you read about how these films were made you learn time and time again (at least after Star Trek I) that Paramount wouldn't loosen the purse strings an inch.  They knew that these films WOULD make money - why be so tight-fisted?  Same thing applies today.  ST I gets some more cash to 'fix' it's problems, ST V is denied this.  Can you imagine what Shatner could have done with just a little money &amp; todays computer technology?  Sybok's 'horde-lets' transformed into an army of thousands.  More depth to the outer space shots.  And the ending Shatner always planned - that would have been something to see!  Paramount should be ashamed on how it has treated it's cash cow all these years.  After all - if you don't believe me just look at the original DVDs of the feature films, whose idea of 'bonus' features was widescreen and having the trailer on it!
B000001EC1|4.0|This is a great best of &quot;Bon Jovi&quot; cd, and really has almost everything that it should. 14 tracks including the huge hits &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot;, &quot;You Give Love a Bad Name&quot;, &quot;Bad Medicine&quot;, &quot;Keep the Faith&quot;, and two versions of &quot;Living on a Prayer&quot;. Also this has the excellent soundtrack song &quot;Blaze of Glory&quot;, and the new song &quot;Always&quot;. The only tracks that really seem missing are &quot;Never Say Goodbye&quot; and &quot;Living In Sin&quot;. Of course &quot;It's My Life&quot; came out well after this was released. There is a new hits disc out called &quot;This Left Feels Right: With A Twist&quot;, but that has all the songs reworked. I would stick with &quot;Cross Road&quot;. It has all the original versions, and will go great with your &quot;Van Halen&quot; and &quot;Def Leppard&quot; cd's.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|It's great to finally own this Pink Floyd classic on DVD in it's finest glory.  The Video transfer is fabulous.  I never imagined it could look anything but VHS-scratchy.  Now I can finally watch it as much as I want without fear of wearing out the tape.<BR>The only down side to it is the Director's cut.  Pink Floyd's fan who have never seen the original might not have a problem with the new material but, to any fan of the original the new shots in the Director's cut are cheesy and distracting.  Luckily both versions are included on the DVD, so you have the opportunity to watch both and make up your own mind.  Along with both versions of the film, there are a slew of extra features such as a documentary, lyrics, photo gallery and other &quot;Odds N' Sods.&quot;  All in all this is a must-have, for both new and experienced Pink Floyd fans. peace.
055357342X|5.0|From Mr. Martins web page and from emails I have exchanged with him, I can tell he is serious about his writing and wants a quality product, unlike some other authors who churn them out for the dough.<br />His unique style of writing, wrapping his characters in realistic personalities as well as setting the scene with political intrigue has this reader spell bound page after page.<br />The trials and hardships of the people in his stories are not glossed over with sugar, he paints a true picture of how things most likely were in the era in which his tale takes place. There is no guessing what is going to happen next, no cookie cutter formulas, no genre stereotypes. If anyone has broken the writing mold and come up with something unique, it would be George R.R. Martin.<br />I wait as patiently as I can for the fourth in the series, not minding the time it takes. I know the wait will be well worth it. As another reviewer said, I have read the first three a second time to keep me fresh in the story, and will read them a third time if need be. And I NEVER, ever read a book twice!!<br />Another redeeming quality in Mr. Martin is his goodwill genuine like for his fans. Unlike some other writers in the genre who have made fools of themselves in interviews and at signings. Mr. Martin has class, a lot of it.
B000003TAB|5.0|'Incesticide' was my first Nirvana album, because it was cheap, and now I own 'Nevermind' and 'In Utero' too,but this is the best.It's an excellent set, which incldes some average Vasalines songs turned into excelent Nirvava covers.The best song is 'Son of a Gun' because it leaves an imprint on your mind,and 'Dive','Sliver' and a rowdy version of '(New Wave)Polly' are also worth a mention.This is the best Nirvana album, so go buy it now!It should be fairly cheap.
B000066NW0|4.0|Hello everyone,first of all i will like to rule out that Miss Lavigne NEVER,EVER claim herself to be PUNK!Just because she's a newcomer with more rocking edgy style and those amazing &quot;rare  attitude&quot;,people misguided her type of music.She's in fact pop+rock+alternative and a little of country singer.Yes,she does has precocious talent,where she could sings,writes and plays the guitar.Thanks to her dynamic vocals and different voice range capablities that we have &quot;Let Go&quot;, a quintaple platinum status album and a handful grammy nominations which has already sold over 10 millions of copies worldwide.And believe me,as avril grows,her song writing skills are soon to be improved on a more mature side.She sets the example of a great teen icon for kids,unlike britney at the age of 19,but singing &quot;Boys&quot; and &quot;I'm a Slave for You&quot;.With her memorable voice,we'll probably be witnessing a fine country singer in making.......
B000053VAZ|4.0|great movie with Depp as Sam who falls for Joon played by Masterson who is mentally ill and who has an older brother played by Aidan Quinn. wonderfully acted with Depp doing great bits. for his loving women fans. a not to be missed Depp film I might add.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Give the girl the credit she deserves.An 8 times Grammy winners,who else could do that for her?In nowadays where pop queens are reigning,Norah Jones seems to come from another planet.She's a blue jazz chauntease,a great sleeper with a smoky clear voice,her sweet,hynotising vocals will leave the album wanting and ensure her a place in the future!Hopefully she'll writes on her own lyrics someday.
080018789X|4.0|great movie which has one of Cruise's most great performances as the sportsman Maguire who falls in love with mom Zellweger(whos just so sexy) and her kid Lipnicki(funny kid). Cruise is dumped by Kelly Preston(watch her in that nude scene, oh boy) and is dumped by Jerry O'Connell because he switched to some other contracter. Cuba Gooding Jr.(fantastic, \\"show me the money\\") is assigned to him. emotions spill and tensions rise  and this one is one of the best films of 1996, period. the highlight in the film involves where Cruise comes to Zellweger's house drunk and Lipnicki wants to go to zoo and he talks to Gooding Jr. on the <BR>phone(uproarous)
B000002WUD|3.0|I'm not familiar with his 70's output outside this box set, and supposedly there was a lot of subpar material recorded during this time. That alone could make this enticing to a diehard Elvis fan. Like some of the testaments given here, Dave Marsh's liner notes emphatically and persistently argues that Elvis created a wealth of great work in the 70's. I listened to this whole box set several times over the years, shuffling the order or start to finish on long trips. I tried coming from a fresh perspective, avoiding any comparison to his earlier &quot;classic&quot; work, but I can't help but feel that the set isn't that great. I tried, but it just doesn't live up to the mammoth praise people have heaped upon this set. However overhyped it may be, it still has some good, even brilliant moments.<br />The first two discs collect the singles. Overall, they're okay, but often schlocky. Elvis's voice is strong throughout these singles, but most of the time, he doesn't sing with much subtlety. His phrasing isn't that sly and inspired anymore, and he occasionally stoops to bellowing. He's still pretty much in command, but he can't overcome the over-cooked arrangements. The best tracks, &quot;Burning Love,&quot; &quot;Steamroller Blues,&quot; &quot;I've Got a Thing For You Baby,&quot; and maybe a few others, do come together; great stuff but that's only a fraction of these two discs.<br />The next two discs are studio highlights, and here's where the set gets more interesting. The song selection is more daring, the performances are more loose and relaxed. Not just the rehearsals, but the master performances as well. The extra production is also stripped away, and most of the material has a live feel (maybe they were cut live, maybe there are overdubs, but regardless it feels pretty live). The downside is that these recordings are so loose, a number of them are a bit too unpolished. There are a few fragments and incomplete songs, and it's frustrating because with a tiny bit more focus, a great fragment like &quot;Lady Madonna&quot; (only a minute and a half, and Elvis doesn't know most of the lyrics; he does some entertaining scatting, though) could've been a classic.<br />The last disc is my favorite, the best of the whole set. Sort of a simulation of a 74-minute concert, it's consists of live performances taken from various shows, and the flow is seamless. Start to finish, this is highly entertaining and fun, and though loose and relaxed, Elvis is in total command the whole time (occasionally flubs a lyrics, but it doesn't break the spell once). The arrangements, the setlist, and the performances are pretty tight. I almost wish this was reissued separately, because it makes for a great live document.<br />So, yes, it's get better as it goes along. It may be a distillation of a decade's worth of music, but it still feels sprawling, still has some rough spots. It doesn't come together for a truly sustained period of time until the last disc.
6301697707|5.0|a classic nodoubt. with its chilling premise of what the hell is going on underground and what are these snake things that eat us. suspenseful from beginning to end with Bacon and Ward being dynomite in the leads. Michael Gross and Reba MacIntyre really put the gun in guns as one of the snakes enter there house and they unload on it. followed by 2 sequels which the 2nd on is better than the 3rd one
B000066AXC|5.0|This moving, very stirring film required several viewings on my part.  First of all, I had to get over the disappointment that A BEAUTIFUL MIND beat out &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; as the Best Picture of 2001--a disappointment that created an inherent bias in my not-so-beautiful mind.  Second, all of the Hollywood embellishments in this film had to be dismissed as inconsequential to the overall magnitude of the story--a story about a very real man with a very real illness.<br />And it is here--the story--that A BEAUTIFUL MIND excels.  The human mind is a complex, often unforgiving organ that tends to confuse its owner over what is real, and what is an illusion.  And thus the distinction between reality and illusion becomes blurred, a disturbing development that leads to complete dysfunction.  Princeton mathematician John Nash succumbed to the power of his mind to distort reality; the resulting battle to conquer his demons--aided by the unwavering support of a loving wife--is a compelling, wonderful story.<br />Russell Crowe delivers a riveting performance, but needs to work on his West Virgina accent.  Jennifer Connelly, Christopher Plummer, and Ed Harris are sensational.  I'm still a little miffed that this film won Best Picture, but darn glad A BEAUTIFUL MIND is in my video collection.<br />--D. Mikels
0800187873|5.0|the two leads give dynamic and outstanding performances as Donnie and Lefty. its based on the real Brascos life and its made with such class and sophisticating. its dramatic through out and the characters are believeable. the real life Brasco was satisfyed with Depp after he did this film and they all thanked him(watch Inside The Actors Studio with Depp, 2002 episode). great job by Mike Newell
B00009V7PJ|5.0|After reading the various reviews on this DVD I decided to part with some well-earned cash. Boy, was it ever worth it! This DVD really rocks! How this lady does it I will never know. Each and every song is a true masterpiece and performed by a fine, fine entertainer. But it's not just Cher's performance that amazes. Her dancers, her costumes, the set design, the lighting, the sound, in fact absolutely everything ooze class and quality. I HIGHLY recommend this DVD - it is quite brilliant.
0780622545|5.0|it begins good and ends satisfying. its about this men who stop time and rearrange the city like people playing with dolls and one man finds this out as he goes and trys to find the truth and that is that hes in space in a made up place. the men are like the little girls and then the people are like ken and barbie, playing with them, moving them around, doing experiments on them. Alex Proyas makes another great science fiction movie alongside his 1994 classic &quot;The Crow&quot;. the end where Sewell gets all the superpowers is great. Sutherland is wacky as the doc and Connelley has never been so gorgeous.
B000092T6M|1.0|I remember when ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES came out, I had extremely high hopes for it. The promotional stills and interviews looked promising, and I was expecting a high-spirited romp on par with Errol Flynn's celebrated film. Boy, was I in for a letdown.<br />The movie started off thrillingly, with Michael Kamen's spectacular score playing over medieval illustrations. But as soon as the opening credits ended, the film showed its true colors...a dark, dank, gore-laden bore. Seriously, what Robin Hood movie worth its salt starts with a dismemberment scene? I couldn't even look at the screen for this sequence. Alas, it was only the beginning. We're later treated to a close-up of Robin slitting his hand open (and blood seeping thru his fingers) to swear revenge for his father, we see Will Scarlett take an arrow thru the hand, we see the Sheriff of Nottingham's witch slice her arm open and spit into her blood to make a prediction, we see a blood-filled egg cracked open in another scene, we see the Sheriff's face getting stitched up...really, how's a guy supposed to keep his popcorn down? How did this movie get away with a PG-13 rating? This is R-level stuff all the way. Of course, the movie's lack of color and light doesn't help much. I don't mind them foregoing the tights for this go-round, but why isn't Robin Hood wearing his signature Lincoln green? Why isn't Will Scarlett at least wearing SOMETHING red? Everybody's wearing browns and blacks, which makes the film monochromatic and dull. Sherwood Forest looks dirty and gloomy instead of inviting and exciting. The sets are so dark and shadowy that it's a miracle anyone can see where they're going. I'm sure John Graysmark and John Bloomfield did their best with the sets and costumes, but they would have been better served had they been colorful and well-lit. And the plot takes too much of the spirit out of the legend. Robin's such a sullen gloomy Gus that it's impossible to imagine the Merry Men taking him in, muchless letting him lead them. Friar Tuck's reduced to a potbellied wimp (what happened to the swordsman who was more lethal than he looked?). Azeem, while a good character in his own right, really doesn't belong in the Robin Hood mythos. (He would have made a fine stand-alone character, though.) The witch has no business being in this film at all. And what purpose does it serve to make Will Scarlett Robin's traitorous half-brother? Director Kevin Reynolds tries to guide the movie with a swift and steady hand, but the film is such a dismal mess that he ultimately can't hold it together. It's so ponderous and serious that there's no sense of fun to be had. And hearing Kamen's glorious score accompanying the film makes the experience even worse. That music deserved to be in a much better movie, and it possesses the fun, exciting spirit that the movie itself utterly lacks.<br />And then there's the acting. You couldn't find a better Sheriff of Nottingham than Alan Rickman, and he literally steals the show. But that's not too hard when everyone else stinks. Morgan Freeman does his best with Azeem, but again, this character doesn't belong in the saga. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio doesn't have any spark as Marian, nor is she really beautiful enough to play the part. (Olivia DeHavilland she ain't.) Christian Slater can't make heads or tails of the tarnished Will. Brian Blessed is wasted as Robin's doomed dad, as is Michael Wincott as Guy of Gisbourne. Sean Connery's cameo as King Richard is fun, but pointless. The supporting players are so dull they aren't even worth mentioning. And Kevin Costner...great actor, but a LOUSY Robin Hood. He has neither the presence or the attitude this character requires, and he's always talking in a droning monotone. In no way does he come off as an inspiring leader; he's more apt to put you to sleep. Nor does he have the physicality the role demands. I haven't seen a Robin Hood this inept since Barrie Ingham in A CHALLENGE FOR ROBIN HOOD. Yeah,Costner gets in a few good shots with an arrow, but when Robin thoroughly sucks at swordplay and can't even take the Sheriff without help from Azeem, you know the filmmakers have screwed up. Robin Hood's supposed to be the last dude on the planet you want to mess with, not a graceless klutz. Errol Flynn would have trashed the Sheriff and his witch with both hands tied behind his back. Heck, even Cary Elwes' MEN IN TIGHTS incarnation and Disney's cartoon fox Robin would have made short work of them. This Robin...well, had he been killed at the end of the movie, I doubt anyone would have really cared. He's hardly the sort of guy you want to root for.<br />Call me old-fashioned, but I don't like my swashbuckler epics to be gory, dark, and dismal exercises in tedium. I like them bright, colorful, exuberant, and fun...with a minimum of bloodletting. THE MASK OF ZORRO is a case in point, as are THE PRINCESS BRIDE, LORD OF THE RINGS and PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN. Compared to those films, PRINCE OF THIEVES falls horribly short. Compared to the Errol Flynn classic it so wants to topple, it's an even bigger failure. Maybe some day there'll be a good, modern Robin Hood movie that measures up to the Flynn version and truly revives the legend for a new generation. But for now, this film ain't it. Stick with the Flynn version.
6303407188|5.0|one of my all time favorite Johnny Depp movies. nicely done in black in white about a director, Ed Wood(superbly and awesomely played by Johnny Depp), who is one of the worst directors ever and he gets to work with Bela Lugosi(a great performance by Martin Landau). full of other wonderful cast members with Sarah Jessica Parker, Bill Murray and Juliet Landau(Drusilla on Buffy The Vampire Slayer and who is also Martin Landau's daughter). fun from start to finish.
B00005JLYW|5.0|When I saw this movie in the theater, I had one of the best movie experiences in recent memory.  The movie was wonderfully over the top, well paced, exciting, sexy, full of delightful surprises and gags and just plain fun.  Moreover, I haven't laughed so much out loud at the movies in ages.  So I was surprised afterwards when I went online to read reviews of the movie and found that it was almost universally panned.  Well, let me set all you critics straight -- the movie is almost entirely camp and fantasy.  To actually critique it against any serious criteria is to miss the point of the movie entirely.  In fact, I kept on saying throughout the movie, \\"Oh my God, that's so stupid!\\"  But with a big grin on my face.  Which, of course, was the intended audience reaction.  My only criticism is of Demi Moore, who was the only one to receive praise among the critics who panned the movie.  The problem with her role and performance was that she was the only one who played it straight, which made her villian seem completely out of place in the movie.  That the critics found her the only good point in the movie goes to show you where they're coming from!
6305909326|4.0|there are some good Polanski movies out there like Fearless Vampire Killers and The Pianist and this one is ok but its sparked by Depp's depth of his character as he goes on a search for the truth, leading him into a world of sick and twisted things. nicely directed but the finale is a little falayed out but in the end with Depp and Lagella's work it becomes intense and a good ride.
1586210912|4.0|Rich Dad Poor Dad audio is a riveting story of the narrator's childhood and how he was influenced by two different perspectives: that of his dad, a govt employee, and his friend's dad, a capitatlist to the max.<br />He illustrates principles he learned from his friend's father and shows the counterpoint views of his own dad, ironically the formally educated one. <br />The narrator stresses not just education, which he does value, but also financial intelligence, which he stresses is not taught in school.<br />The narrator has an interesting voice, and the tale conveys these principles in a way that is easy to follow. The story is told in a fashion that reminds me of John Boy narrating the life of the Waltons. It's down to earth and yet conveys principles with each illustration.
B00005JMD3|3.0|dont find logic in this movie but the sequencing of action are great and Farrell is pumped and primed in the lead. Jackson is great as Farrell's boss. Martinez(the bad guy) seems miscast though. LL Cool J and Michelle Rodriquez flame and spark good supporting roles. also starring Josh Charles of Tv's Sports Night. basically for action junkies or fans of all the stars.
B00006BXI0|4.0|Divine wings of tragedy has some nice riffs and solos, Michael Romeo proves to be some sort of DimmeBagDarrell meets John Petrucci guitar player.
6304458924|4.0|you've all seen movies where the bad guys seize the plane and reck havoc like in Con Air, Air Force One, Executive Decision and so forth. Liotta is dynamite in a tour-de-force performance as he kills off everyone on the plan except a few and Lauren Holly who has trouble dealing with the fact that a psycho is trying to kill her and she doesnt know how to land the damn plane. intense, violent and that is good enough for me.
B000005DSN|5.0|Stratovarius best, by far. Highlights: Black Diamond, Forever free, forever free, forever free (oh, sorry), Paradise, Holy Light, Legions, Visions.<br />And please, check out the melody of star wars played by the keyboards in the end of Before The Winter.
B00005JLSE|1.0|The 1920's produced so much superb music in America.<BR>Sadly the music in Chicago sounds as if it's been generated by an abysmally programmed computer. No heart, no soul, no genuine period flavour.<BR>Very disappointing.
B00008H2LB|2.0|Ok, i gotta admmit that this review has some prejudice on it. But i'll try to get that away. <BR>Linking Park shows some good evolution in Meteora, doing this sort of &quot;Korn meets The Backstreet boys&quot; metal. In fact, one could easily say that there's no metal at all in Linking Park's approach to music. There's just a couple of heavily-distorted guitars and that's all. But that's my opinion being a metal listener.<br />The songs are very catchy, and the guys can sing and scream like they were in a real nu-metal band (i don't like Nu metal either). So, Linking Park did a good job on this one, and there's no doubt that this album is going to be considered just great by the teenagers.
B00005JMNY|2.0|I suggest that you read the book instead. It explains things in detail and gives you a much better picture of the club kids. I was so excited to see the film because I loved the book, but honestly it was a let down. It rushed through everything and did not go into great detail about anything that happened, infact some of the characters mentioned in the book were not even in the film. Good acting, bad story line. However, Party Monster The Shockumentary, now that is something that you need to see.
B00006RU5B|3.0|The Soundgarden meets RATM band is just like that, unfortunately. The guitar riffs follow the style of RATM but a little more...mmm, yeah, let's say it: commercial and softer. I loved Soundgarden's music and lyrics, and one could hardly listen to this band not remembering RATM or Soundgarden, it's the risk you take when doing such a fusion of people. Anyways, this new line up couldn't produce a solid group of songs for an album. There's some ones here and there but in general, the album doesn't show some authentic Audioslave sound.<br />Bottomline: Audioslave reaches a quality level that's lower than any of it's &quot;parent&quot; bands, unfortunately.
B00007BHOE|4.0|I gotta admit, you gotta love Slipknot. What other band is as great as them? This DVD proves that there isn't. I love the songs and the part on the second disc where you can have multiple camera angles on certain songs. I would always watch Joey drum. Who wouldn't? You need to go and buy this DVD. It's just so great.
0316666343|5.0|Although the beginning of this novel is ugly and horrifying, the story is beautiful and inspiring. Alice Sebold has written her characters, especially the main character Susie Salmon, so well and with such insight that I felt I knew them. Several parts of the story moved me to tears, only the second book out of the thousands I've read to do so. Rarely does a book this powerful and emotionally riveting come along. Thank you Ms Sebold for bringing Susie and her family into my life.
B00005A46T|4.0|Dude, as usual, Slipknot delivers the great taste we love. I love Slipknot, and Corey is just..magnificant?...Joey's drumming makes drumming look so easy when you watch Disasterpieces...go buy this cd now...or else...
6302820448|5.0|This film is on its way to being every bit as much a family classic as It's a Wonderful Life. In fact, I can easily imagine it in black and white with Jimmy Stewart playing Billy Murray's role.  Murray pulls this movie off effortlessly and it is definitely one to watch over and over again. I think it may be his best.<br />Bill Murray is a weather reporter in Philadelphia. He is also a male chauvinist, a prima donna and real jerk in general.  He does not want to go to Punxsutawney to cover the Groundhog Day celebration and during his report even says something to the effect that `this is one time where cameras can't truly capture the effect of a big rat predicting the weather'.  He is sarcastic and contemptuous of everyone and everything. All he wants to do is go back to Philadelphia but a blizzard he predicted would not hit DID hit and he is stuck in Punxsutawney. He is also stuck in GroundHog Day.  Every day following is February 2nd and he wakes in his bed with the alarm clock a playing Sonny &amp; Cher  tune.<br />I have heard it said that this is the consummate film on reincarnation.  Maybe it is. He can't make it stop and he has no choice but to settle in and learn what gives life its value regardless of where one is or what is going on - although that is not his first or even second choice.  This is a very funny film as well as a real `feel good' flick.
B00000JCOV|5.0|Dude, this cd is just..man..I can't even describe it. They are just so great that there is no word that can be humanily possible to describe them as. This cd is GREAT. Wait and Bleed and Spit it Out are the best tracks. Now, you will buy this cd because it has great music and the lyrics are catchy. Well, there is other reasons but don't get me started...
B000089RVX|4.0|I would definitaley recommend this cd to everyone. The music is good and the tune is just so..god I kan't think of a word. Well, just to let you know, you have gotta buy it if you are into gothic style music, even if you aren't, buy it anyway. You gotta give it a shot before you hate, right?
B00004SZWD|5.0|It doesn't get any beter than this Stevie Wonder is considered a musical geinus and  he definitely deserves that title and he should wear it ...... He is so extraordinarily wonderful and this is one of his nest albums everys ong on here is good and every song has a great meaning to it this album is wonderful and it brings back a lot of memories!!!!!   My favorites are Sir Duke, I wish, As, Knocks Me off My Feet, and many more!!!!<br />If you like neo-soul then I would definitely recommend that you buy this this album because this classic neo-soul at its finest!!!!<br />This album also reminds me of the good old days!!!!
B0000BWVCM|2.0|Nightcrawler was cool during the action sequences but why are we having an ultra-dramatic scene about him being an outcast within the first act of the film.  The team and the audience just met him and already we have to cry for him.<br />Why does the movie seem like a long set-up for the third one.  We know Pyro is bad so can't we just get on with it so we can enjoy a Pyro/Iceman fight.  I wince at how many imaginative things they failed to do with Iceman's abilities.<br />All the amazing, original villains in the X-Men universe and this multi-million dollar film decides to focus on Stryker and LadyDeathstrike.  A low-key character actor picking up some extra cash and a black clad woman with dark glasses who has the exact same powers as one of our heroes.  WOW!  They really give Mystique and Sabretooth a run for their money!<br />In the first film, Cyclops seemed to be a straight man for the rebellious Wolverine.  So what interesting direction does the sequel decide to take with his character.  It doesn't.  It does even LESS with him.  Unless you consider his overblown, unnecessarily melodramatic crying at the end of the film, a form of character.<br />How anyone could consider this film better than the first X-men is beyond me but perhaps I'm just a Mutant amongst too many humans.
B00000JFV9|5.0|This album soundtrack was written and composed by the immaculate, multi-talented, wonderful, musical geinus Curtis Mayfield this is an awesome soundtrack I like all of the songs on this album is &quot;GIMME YOUR LOVE&quot;  this is the best song on here but my other favorites are :Little Child Running Wild, Gimme Your Love, Freddy's Dead, I'm Your Pusher, and many good other songs I would definitely recommend anyone who likes Curtis Mayfield to buy this album!!!!
B00005JKJA|4.0|Even if Mr. Chronological's interpretation of this film is correct, this type of narrative construction can hardly be considered simple to follow. This film is deliberately confusing, as Lynch films are more like dreams than conventional stories. If Mulholland Drive would have been constructed in a fashion that was simple to follow, it would not have the same dramatic effect. This film is open to many interpretations, and trying to simplify something that is intentionally complicated is not the answer.
B00005A1PR|5.0|This is a great album and India is a great artist this album has great songs on here and they are very nicely composed also I really do think that this is a very nice album and especially a great album to be a debut she  is fantastically  creative and talented she is truly an artist snd she deserves any award that she is nominated for!!!!!!  Some of my favorite songs are: Video, Brown Skin, Strength, Courage, and Wisdom, and I am ready for love and many others !!!!!  Therefore, I would recommend anyone who likes and enjoy neo-soul music!!!!
B00005YW4H|5.0|The first time I heard the music of Norah Jones, I was captivated by the sound.  Her music is smooth and melodious, unlike the hyper screaming of today's pop, which often seems more interested in making a lot of fast noise, than putting together quality music.  I strongly disagree with those who claim that her music is androgynous, or irritating, rather, it is refreshing to find an alternative to the same old rhythm-driven drivel being pumped out by more shallow artists.  Norah's voice may not be the best I've heard, but it is certainly one of the most interesting and distinctive; the kind of cool inimitability that makes an artist more than just another good voice.  Norah's talents extend beyond her vocal chords, a pretty mean jazz piano, and a gift for timing demonstrate that, unlike her peers, she is more than just a vocalist singing in front of accompaniment. I played nothing else in my car for almost six months after I bought this CD; I have a new favorite female artist!
B000002L7R|5.0|The recent success of Rufus Wainwright's brilliant \\"Want One\\" had me thinking back to the last time an artist put out a sonically dense, adventurous, goofily eccentric, high romantic masterpiece.  My favorite Prince album came to mind.  I was only 18 when the oriental-occidental sonic fusion of \\"Around the World in a Day\\" first reached my ears.<br />I can remember wondering even then \\"How will this quirky music hold up?\\"  I can remember thinking how Prince was so far ahead of everyone else musically.  As music sinks into boy band chirpiness and nu-metal lugubriousness, the time is right to reach back and listen to a Prince classic from the mid-80s.<br />\\"Around the World in a Day\\" opens with Far Eastern sounds and can be properly called Beatlesque, a very late entry as a cut on the Fab Four's 1966 album \\"Revolver.\\"<br />If a song were a Salvidor Dali painting, it would sound like \\"Paisley Park,\\" a strange ditty packed with symbolic and surreal imagery.  It limns a libertarian world of fun and frolic, a utopia that children--or at least the children of the 60s--might dream about.<br />Campy romance is next in the humorous excesses of \\"Condition of the Heart.\\"  Prince's squealing vocals prance all over this funny yet heartfelt tune.  In places, its lyrics are gorgeous:  \\"Every single day's a yellow day, and I'm blinded by the daisies in your yard.\\"<br />\\"Raspberry Beret\\" is a great story-telling song about a young slacker who'd blows off work to ride motorcycles and make love in a barn.  <br />\\"Tamborine\\" is Prince proving he's so oversexed, he can make a salacious metaphor out of anything.  D. H. Lawrence would be proud.<br />\\"America,\\" a piece of chugging rock-funk, is Jimi Hendrix buttoned down for the 80s.  Boy, this song is tasty!<br />\\"Pop Life,\\" a paean to hedonism undercut by its monotone delivery, features thunderous chords and rippling arpeggios, great breathy sex kitten back-up vocals, and witty 80s cocaine references.<br />\\"Ladder\\" spins faux-mythology into strange electro-gospel that's as rich and lush as good cheesecake.  Don't look for it to make sense; just soak in it.<br />\\"Temptation\\" closes the album with Prince's struggle between his sensual and spiritual impulses.<br />Prince seems mischievous after the mega-success of 1984's \\"Purple Rain,\\" giving us an album of uptempo quirk, knowing everyone would listen.  Well, listen again!
B0000C0FJB|5.0|This album is for music fans, and not just Rush fans. The amount of music in the package, the quality of the recording, the energy captured from the record is amazing.<br />Die hard Rush fans will appreciate the wide range of songs from their early beginnings to the current releases. Also, new Rush fans and music fans not exposed to RUSH will appreciate this recording since it encapulates the essence of RUSH -- the energy, and the power of thier live perforances. <br />Its a LIVE recording for God's sake!  <br />This and the DVD are worth it !
B00009UW0N|5.0|Halloween is John Carpenter's best film. It is a classic horror film that will be watched long after I'm gone. It is excellent because it is so simple. It does not rely on buckets of blood or fancy special effects. Halloween builds tension and keeps a viewer at the edge of their seat. A sense of dread of what it to come is prevalent at all times. You know the killer is going to strike but WHEN? The main character Laurie Strode is very adorable and the audience is immediately sympathetic to her. The killer who is after her is the devil come to life (figuratively of course). He wears a mask that is horrifying and carries a big ass knife. Micahael Myers attacks without a noise (aside from the freaky rasping noise he makes) and shows absoulutely no mercy. He is the most frightening villain in cimema history. Anyone who says this movie is boring has a severe case of cinematic A.D.D. This movie is scary beyond reckoning. Halloween is a movie that you really have to watch. It's not flashy and the action is not in your face, but it is the tension that leads up to a murder is the scary part. Guys, on a dark night (preferably Halloween), turn out the lights and sit on the couch with your girlfriend. Pop in Halloween and she will be all over you. I hate to sound like the bus driver in Billy Madison but, I know from experience.
B00004Z459|5.0|Let's be serious here for a moment...Linkin Park is a musical travesty.
0792160347|3.0|This film is stylishly shot and poorly acted, and paced at about the speed a rich old woman might utilize to putter about the perfume section of Neiman Marcus.<br />I think it would have been more interesting if Julian had been an amnesia-suffering killer who, after his rich senator's wife angel rescues him from prison, murders her, too, and then goes back to turning gay tricks on the \\"bad side of town.\\" But that didn't happen.<br />A lot of male/female dialogue in this movie is truly cringeworthy, and the funniest line to me is when Julian's lawyer tells him \\"The maid saw you try and rescue Leon, so they're not going to prosecute on that\\" after Julian pushes the guy off a twelfth floor balcony. That's like shooting someone and then being let off because you put a pillow under their head while they died. I also found it peculier that in a sprawling city of ten million or so people where supposedly no one ever leaves their car, characters keep running into one another on city streets and shops.<br />All in all, a good snapshot of wealthy LA on the cusp of the eighties, but there really isn't much more to be gleaned from this movie than that.<br />One note on the sound quality of the DVD. The dialogue is very hard to pick up at times, which forces one to turn up the volume quite high. This gives the viewer an unpleasant jolt whenever the pounding Moroder tunes come in, because they are recorded very loud. Be warned.
B00005AQGH|5.0|This is the best rap cd I've ever heard. Me against the World and ThugLife  1 are also klassiks.

B000089RVR|5.0|Dido may not be a great technical singer, but she is so refreshing and pleasant to listen to in today's world of manufactured pop, bad rap, & Nirvana \\"wannabe\\" type bands that have so taken over the airwaves (oh, how I miss the 70's & 80's!).  She is one of the very few solo artists currently in the scene who writes her own songs and also has a lot of control on the production.  Simply put, the outcome results is good pop music that people of all ages can enjoy.  Her lyrics provoke feeling, yet are kept simple and never overwhelming.  <br />In \\"Life for Rent\\", I feel the lyrics are more mature this time around.  Just an example from the title track ...\\"if my life is for rent and I don't learn to buy, well I deserve nothing more than I get, cos nothing I have is truly mine...\\".  This is simple, but clever. In my opinion, this is how good pop song lyrics should be.<br />The first thing I realised was how much cleaner the recording is as compared to \\"No Angel\\".  It must have been recorded on better equipment as there is much less hiss on this album.  Some people have argued with me over this, but I have a few copies of \\"No Angel\\" and there's definitely a lot of unintentional hiss on all  copies.  I feel you are seriously hard of hearing if you cannot recognize it.  I'm not talking about the vinyl record effect used on the title track either...which was obviously intentional.  <br />We hear some of her typical voice characteristics on this album,  but the quality of singing has seemed to improve. In the title track during the second chorus, she does her signature slide of voice into the high falsetto that she does so well without yodeling.  She does it so beautifully, that it gives me the chills at times.  This is definitely one of my favorite tracks on the album.  Her voice also shines in the chorus of \\"Don't Leave Home\\".  There is power and strength there that we didn't get to hear on \\"No Angel\\".  If you liked her voice in \\"No Angel\\", you will love it here as well.<br/>Some people have rated this album (for better or worse) according to how they feel it compares to \\"No Angel\\".  If that were the case, then I would have to give it 4 stars instead of 5 since I prefer \\"No Angel\\" better as a whole.  However, \\"Life for Rent\\" stands on it's own and I feel it should be rated as such.<br />The reason I prefer \\"No Angel\\" better is because it has a certain flow to it that keeps you listening song after song.  I also preferred the musical arrangements a bit better.  Some of \\"Life for Rent\\" seems overproduced a bit.  I wonder if it was due to this p*nut guy who is credited for a lot of the programming.  Whomever is was used way too many samples and beats which we've heard way too many times.  This is probably my biggest gripe about this album.  Example, the sampled male voice in \\"Who Makes You Feel\\" drives me nuts! The scratchy vinyl record effect is also getting a bit old.  It was cool on the song \\"No Angel\\", but  they should have left it there.  But as for the lyrics and the strongness of the songs along with better vocals, \\"Life for Rent\\" is a winner.  A live performance of this album without all the fancy programming would be amazing!

B0000C0FJB|5.0|What a show! The band just rocked, and Alex was on fire. The crowd sound level is high, which is good, because this is no ordinary crowd. The crowd in Rio just goes nuts. Check out YYZ where the crowd sings along with the instrumental note for note. The chants and the crowd participation are much more lively than the two shows I saw in the US on this tour. Some people may not like the sound, as it is not as good as a studio album, but it is a live album. They had a night with no sound check, a primitive recording truck, a night after their equipment was soaked during a show. With no overdubbing, they put out hell of a CD with a great &quot;live&quot; feel. Their best live CD ever. My ears are going to be bleeding by the end of the week.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|THIS MOVIE BLEW.  I am Severly pissed that I cannot give it MINUS 10 stars.
6305364648|4.0|Let make the record strait.This movie is very well made, fun to watch but keep in mind its a complete remake almost scene by scene of a french movie called &quot;lA TOTALE&quot; with Miou-Miou and Thierry l'Hermite, another exemple that Hollywood has to take other people ideas because it can not come up with any on his onwn.
0312319517|5.0|See storyline above.<br />This is, what I think, one of his best novels of recent past. An exciting thriller that will take you to the past. With scenes about the 'tunnel rats' of Vietnam to the atrocities put forth by the Milosevics, including a wife, son and daughter described as making &quot;...the Munsters look like Little House on the Prairie&quot;, too the present, with hero/protagonist Calvin Dexter out to capture Zoran Zilic (the name even sounds evil) an old Milosevic henchman.<br /> I'd really like to see this become a series. With a great skill at writing international thrillers and a super hero like Calvin Dexter, how can you go wrong.<br />Highly recommended.
B000006O7C|3.0|Had the marketing gluttons at Columbia held their greed in check and issued this at a single disc's length and price, it might have made a greater impression. Sadly, they have opted to milk the passing of Jeff Buckley by releasing every scrap of tape available, including a disc's worth of unnecessary demos here. &quot;(Sketches For) My Sweetheart The Drunk,&quot; even as an incomplete work, still sounds amazing. Buckley had the soaring voice of a tormented angel and was barely beginning to understand his potential. It shows if you contrast the alternate versions of &quot;Nightmares By The Sea&quot; or &quot;New Year's Prayer.&quot; But aside from those two songs and a straightforward solo performance of &quot;Satisfied Mind,&quot; disc two is the kind of yuck that would never be released if the responsible party had a chance to get back to it later. Unfortunately Jeff Buckley doesn't have that option.<br />But the first disc, oh, what a loss we have sustained! The apocalyptic imagery of &quot;The Sky is a Landfill&quot; fills all the promise of &quot;Grace.&quot; There is a newly mined soulfulness to &quot;Everybody Here Wants You&quot; and a haunted quality to &quot;You and I&quot; that suggests he and producer Tom Verlaine were kindred spirits. (Indeed, some of these songs hearken, in the best way possible, to Verlaine's finest work as a solo artist and with Television.)<br />It's pretty darned obvious that Buckley was in the process of making a brilliant album. The final &quot;My Sweetheart The Drunk&quot; is something we will never hear as Jeff intended, and that's the pity.<br />Disc One: 5 stars<br />Disc Two: 1 star
B0000CD5FN|5.0|Since having left The Clash, Joe Strummer has brought out some interesting albums. This one was recorded before he died and completed by the Mescaleros. <br />It is an excellent album. Moving lyrics, full of wisedom. A rocker that aged gracefully. <br />I think this is going to be on my playlist for a long time.
B000002WPI|5.0|How can you not love this album? if you dont have this how can you call your self a hip hop head?<BR>This is hip hop at its best!! Non of there other albums are as best.
B00005Y7AW|5.0|Rufus Wainwright has an incredible ability to sweep his listeners off into a reverie, lulled into happiness by his soothing voice.  It is impossible to listen to &quot;Poses&quot; withought smiling and sighing happily.  The moment I heard &quot;Greek Song&quot; I fell in love and have not stopped reccomending this album since.  It is well worth the money to own this album!!
B00005JLEX|5.0|The show is not very well known in France, though very witty, and so funny!<BR>I've been looking for tapes for years now, as the show isn't on french tv any more, and my old tapes are just really used! <BR>I cant wait for the dvds to be released, to watch again the bubble boy, the shrinkage, the soup (...).....yada yada!!!<BR>Thank you Jerry I just love you
0156027321|3.0|I read Life of Pi with high expectations and was very happy as the book began to flow along it seemed to slow down.  Early on it promises that &quot;this story will make you believe in God&quot;.  I was not personally expecting this outcome for myself but by the end of the book I never really see where that promise is addressed or even hinted at as a result.  Martel is a gifted writer but I think he tries to do too much with this novel.  He does offer interesting reflections on overcoming one's fear and life as fiction.  I would recommend reading this book within a book group as discussion may help some readers sort through his work.

B000092ZYX|4.0|This album is spectacular.  I won't try to say anything else about it until I make that point.  Nowhere else will you find a group with such a grasp on sounds and how to make them tear up your insides with such abandon, to assault your ears unmercifully.  <BR>The thing is, this is Radiohead, and for some reason, this is what we've come to expect.  <BR>After raising the bar infinitely with O.K. Computer, and continuing the tradition with Kid A and cousin Amnesiac, Radiohead have relentlessly redefined themselves by simply making music, how they want to hear it, and how we need to hear it.  <BR>Maybe Hail to the Thief doesn't do that, and that's why I don't quite feel so emphatically about it as I did about past releases.  Is it better than 99 percent of the stuff out there?  Absolutely.  Do I get something new every time I listen to it?  Without a doubt.  The electronic rhythmic pulse is absolutely mesmerizing, going deeper than it ever has before.  Radiohead has the ability to seduce the listener into a trance-like state, with synthesized soundscapes and soaring vocals.  <BR>I just wouldn't recommend this as a place to start with Radiohead.  But it's definitely a great place to continue.  And it shows that we can always expect something great from this band.  Something honest.
B0000C0FJB|5.0|A lot of people are complaining because Rush just released another live cd 5 years after the previous one. Well, if crappy bands like Dave Matthews and Phish can release 4 million different live cds, why can't a good band, like Rush? <br />Rush In Rio is far superior to Different Stages. The sound on &quot;Rio&quot; seems a bit more raw, but to me, it still sounds better than Different Stages. I thought Rio sounded pretty damn good for not having any kind of soundcheck that night. <BR>The cd contains the entire concert, plus 2 extra songs that were played earlier in the tour. <br />This cd has some of the die-hard fan favorites, like By Tor And The Snow Dog, Natural Science, The Trees, The Pass, La Villa Strangiato, and about 3 minutes of Cygnus X-1. It also has most of the part-time fan favorites, the radio hits, like Tom Sawyer, The Spirit Of Radio, Working Man, Limelight, and New World Man, which is another older song appearing on a live cd for the first time. <BR>It also has a lot of the 80's MTV hits, like Distant Early Warning and The Big Money. <br />So this cd should please ALL the fans. Never bought a live Rush cd before? Start with THIS one! Are you skeptical because you're satisfied with Different Stages? Forget it, buy THIS one! You'll completely forget about Different Stages. <br />The audience is a little annoying once in a while, but that's just the way Brazilians are. If you've heard Iron Maiden's Rock In Rio, you know what I'm talking about. They just like to chant and yell. They even chant along to YYZ. Yeah, the instrumental. <br />This is for die-hard fans and part time fans alike! You won't be disappointed.
0898705525|5.0|I feel sort of silly trying to review a book by Chesterton so I'll just say this: I have read this book twice. The first time I read it I was so disappointed in it that I became angry for having wasted my time. To my eventual benefit I wrote scathing remarks in the margins of each page.<br />A decade later I picked it up again and that's when things got weird. As I read it a second time I got the distinct impression that I was reading a vastly different book. Had the contents magically changed? My scathing margin notes remained the same, however, and I could vaguely discern which passages from Chesterton they were allegedly referring to. I could even, with the help of my notes, reconstruct what I had once thought Chesterton was &quot;hopelessly trying to say.&quot; Since my second reading I have come to regard it as one of my favorite writings. This is truly a masterpiece written by one of the most gifted and imaginative minds we've produced.
B000005QH3|3.0|This movie is at a slow pace for the first half hour, even with car chases that are monotonous. In order for Vanishing Point to work as a good time passer, I would recommend skipping the first half hour if you've already seen it before, because it's the rest of the movie that puts the pedal to the metal, and is pretty fun. Also, if you've recently caught a music video on T.V. by a group called Audioslave, for their latest single, \\"Show Me How to Live,\\" it is basically a shot for shot remake of Vanishing Point, narrowed down to the songs running time.
014028009X|4.0|Bridget Jones Diary written by Helen Fielding. The book is about a woman called Bridget who is in her mid thirties, who is single, smokes and drinks. This book is based like a diary. The story tells us about each day of Bridget's life for about one year explaining the difficulties of being a thirty year old woman who is overweight, single and smokes and drinks.<BR>The story starts of on Christmas day when Bridget goes to a dinner party where Mark Darcy a family friend is there.

Helen Fielding uses very effective ways of writing this story such as comical moments, she also explains what is going on in Bridget's mind and the way the book is set out like a diary which helps us understand how Bridget is feeling. The book is very comical because of Bridget character because she always manages to embarrass her self, which also makes the reader fell sorry for her, which make the reader more involved in the book.<BR> I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and I think any one who is in the same situation, as Bridget will relate to this book and will fully enjoy it as well. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did.
B00003CXSP|2.0|I was disappointed in this film, though it is not entirely  awful.  It misses the uniquely gripping feel of &quot;Lambs&quot; and devolves into scenes of fright and terror meant to shock and revulse in the worst, gratutious way.  Hopkins' performance seems thinner in some spots but almost a caricature of his Oscar-winning performance in others.  Moore holds her own, but I think the film suffers from the producers' presupposition that no matter what they put on screen would benefit from the critical and popular acclaim afforded the first film.  It doesn't happen here.  This film is clearly &quot;off-note.&quot;  I didn't find myself caring more for any of the characters in this chapter.  I couldn't wait until it was over.  Not one I am likely to watch again.
0425173739|5.0|Jacqueline de Bellefort calls on her old friend Linnet Ridgway to tell her that she is engaged to marry a man named Simon Doyle.  Linnet seems to be happy for her friend, but she soon meets Simon and woos him away from Jackie.  Simon and Linnet marry and go on a honeymoon to Egypt, but they are stalked by Jackie wherever they go.  Soon Linnet is killed and Jackie is an obvious suspect.  She has an airtight alibi, and Hercule Poirot has his hands full, trying to find the real killer.  There are other suspects, as Linnet was a very wealthy woman and there are many who would like to get their hands on her fortune.  Poirot works his magic and, by keen observation and a very logical mind, he is able to unravel the mystery.  This is a beautifully constructed book and is Agatha Christie at her finest.
B00000IAU3|5.0|It took around a year, to get this album out of the oblivion, why?, just because it takes radio to listen everything around in a rap song to began playing it, sadly that's a big trend in the business, rap has taken over the top 40, and it's not letting go..., No Angel showcased an artist that produced an amazing contemporary Adult top 40 album that feature a s style that has been almost vanished from radio waves, the ballad, and the sentimental songs, No Angel is a fution between great lyric ballad with slow downtempo electronica beats, every tracks gives the album the push it need it to become one of the best selling album of the new millenium, the highlights of this album are definitely &quot;Here With Me&quot; a trong ballad the portrait the unconditional love, and the need of it, &quot;Hunter&quot; speak about the freedom an space in every relationship, &quot;All You Want&quot; a personal favorite, and one of the most deeply sounding of the album, great chorus line, &quot;Thanyou&quot; the hit, overall this album includes many songs that are well constructed and not even get close to be fillers or flops, this album really stand out of the crowd, and should become an all time classic.
0380789035|3.0|An entertaining tale, creatively told, with a great premise, I felt a little underwhelmed by the end. Part of that is definitely the hype effect as I'd heard so much about Neil Gaiman being this amazing writer that it was next to impossible for him to blow me away. The stakes were too high for that.<br />The book does suffer from a bit of self-indulgence as Gaiman throws everything he can into the 588-page...epic? Road trip? Love story? That's another part of the problem. The book is ostensibly one man's story being told against the backdrop of some rather grandiose events, but at times it feels like it's actually a patchwork of random short stories that couldn't quite stand on their own. And the ending falls somewhere between cheap bait-and-switch and outright letdown.<br />Getting there is fun, though, not unlike a two-week relationship full of (...), drunken philosophizing and a clean, no-strings-attached parting of ways, self-respect still intact. I'd hesistantly recommend it for those looking for something - different? - but with a hearty caveat emptor.
B0000B1OFL|1.0|Totally predictable plot, very undeveloped characters, bad acting, despite good actors (I love Ed Norton) and in addition shameless advertisement of mini cooper cars. Forced myself to finish - very boring. I understand that original movie was much better (didn't see one myself).
B00006AW2L|5.0|This June 1966 album (USA release) was the first with all Stones-written material, and, as an archetypal album, contains the seeds of some of the best and worst moments of the ensuing decades. Mick Jagger is at his most self-assured to date, the varied instruments add texture and interest, and the somewhat underrated rhythm section provides a solid, driving foundation.  On the other hand, certain riffs that were later overplayed creep in, a few songs are just average, and the Stones play one of their worst numbers in \\"High and Dry,\\" marking a romance with country sounds that would produce extremely varied results over the years.<br /><br />The CD opens with four huge hits, \\"Paint it Black,\\" \\"Stupid Girl,\\" \\"Lady Jane,\\" and \\"Under my Thumb.\\" With the exception of \\"Stupid Girl\\" (Jagger sounds somewhat tentative at first over a truly rocking background, then gains strength), these are among the best of their early work--and their early work is generally their best work. \\"Under My Thumb\\" is much tighter than \\"Stupid Girl,\\" the rhythm is years ahead of its time,  and Jagger is much more self-assured. \\"Paint it Black\\" and \\"Under My Thumb\\" benefit immensely from arrangements using sitar and marimba, and both feature superb vocals. The latter song ranks with James Brown's \\"It's A Man's World\\" as one of the greatest misogynistic songs of the period. This is perhaps a dubious distinction, but the song is incredibly impressive, and just an amazingly original effort within the R&B/rock genre.  Jagger is deceitfully playful in his thickly accented \\"Lady Jane,\\" and the imaginative use of Wyman on harpsichord enhances the effect.  All of these songs show the Stones as a multi-dimensional band, definitely still blues and R&B based, but expanding into new territory.<br />The other songs are generally good, especially \\"It's Not Easy,\\" \\"I Am Waiting\\" and the 11:35 minute (!) \\"Going Home,\\" an almost unprecedented song in which Jagger completely nails the struts, panting, lip smacking, gutteral tones, and assorted other vocal sexual tools that became an important part of his persona. His singer-cum-vampire vocal is easily too long, but this cut sweats away and builds to a great crescendo. An overlooked gem. \\"Flight 505\\" has nostalgic value, but it lacks focus both in solo and ensemble playing. There are also some too-easy riffs that later became synonymous (in a repetitive way) with later guitar work. \\"Think, Think\\" plays it too safe; the Monkees could have done this.  As mentioned above, the album also contains the awful, grating,  \\"High and Dry.\\"  If you have a programmable CD player, you'll know what to do with this cut.<br />Personnel and other luminaries include:<br />Mick Jagger -Guitar, Harmonica, Percussion, Composer, Keyboards, Vocals,<br />Keith Richards Guitar, Composer, Keyboards, Vocals<br />Brian Jones - Dulcimer, Guitar, Marimba, Sitar, Bells<br />Charlie Watts- Percussion, Drums, Marimba, Bells<br />Bill Wyman-Organ, Synthesizer, Bass, Piano, Guitar (Bass), Harpsichord, Keyboards, Marimba, Vocals, Bells<br />Ian Stewart-Organ, Piano, Harpsichord, Keyboards<br />Jack Nitzsche-Organ, Percussion, Piano, Harpsichord, Keyboards, Organ (Hammond)<br />Andrew Loog Oldham-Producer<br />I recommend \\"Flowers\\" over this CD, but Stones Fans will want to get both.

B00005NGAG|4.0|Sometimes the plot is not important and sometimes neither is acting. I actually found the acting in this movie quite mediocre. Nonetheless, all this is not important. The movie has style and you can see this from the start. It is quite rare and I value this very much.
B00008H2LB|5.0|this is an AWESOME cd and everyone should listen to it, I mean, these bad reviewers, have you even listened to it? I mean, you can't make a bad review about somethin that you've heard one song of. I, for one, listened to it and it's great:<br /> Don't Stay: 10/10 I love it, punk/rock song sang by Chester.<br /> Somewhere I Belong: 10/10 Slow rap verse, than a heavier chorus makes for an awesome song.<br /> Lying to You: 10/10 One of my favourites, Mike sings the verses and the bridge(With help from Chester) &amp; backs up Chester on the chorus, it's fast, &amp; brilliant.<br /> Hit the Floor: 8.5/10 Great, alot of yelling in the chorus, but it's great. Pedal to the metal.<br /> Easier to Run: 10/10 Slower song, Chester mostly with some help from Mike, it's awesome.<br /> Faint: 9.5/10 Great catchy tune, love it.<br /> Figure_09: 10/10 Rock song, very fast-paced, well-done.<br /> Breaking the Habbit: 10/10 Slow, but shows that Chester can do more then yell.<br /> From the Inside: 9/10 Perfect, except it's great!!<br /> Nobody's Listening: 10/10 Awesome song with a different background music that I'm sure you've never heard before.<br /> Session: 8/10 Good enough instrumental.<br /> Numb: 10/10 Their latest single, it's sad, but it's stunning.<br /> Great album, buy it!!
B00005AQE8|5.0|this cd is amazingly amazing.  I recommend for you to buy it.
B00004ST9Q|4.0|This is a great DVD! But I must admit some of her oldest videos looked a little silly right now! But hte muzik iz good! She's got the voice and the talent! The worst thing about this DVS iz that some videos are missing: &quot;Shoop Song&quot;, &quot;Something In Common&quot;, &quot;When You Believe&quot;, &quot;It's Not Right But It's Okay (thunderpuss remix)&quot;, &quot;Could I Have This Kiss Forever&quot;, &quot;If I Told You That&quot;, &quot;Watchulookinat&quot;, &quot;One Of Those Days&quot; and &quot;Try It On My Own&quot;... Maybe there will be a re-edition... I hope they will include her incredible live performance with Bobby &quot;My Love&quot;...
B000069AUI|5.0|i love this albam it is my most favourite. these guys r my fav band ever. i have listened to the CD like a million times. i also have their first albam and it is just as good. i love them soo much, chris martin writes such beatiful songs and awsome lirics, he is so talented. love you Coldlpay!! xxx
B000002U8G|5.0|This album began the spacey (and in my opinion, the best) phase of Pink Floyd (Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here)<br />&quot;One of These Days&quot; is a lush instrumental which combines a simple running bassline with pedal steel guitar howls and organ bursts. This song is definately one to put you in a trance.<br />&quot;A Pillow of Winds&quot; shows a slower, more sensitive Floyd. Not strikingly beautiful, but pretty nonetheless.<br />&quot;Fearless&quot; is a track that doesn't get alot of credit for what it is. This song is a pastoral, almost folkish jig with lyrics that can only make you laugh. <br />&quot;San Tropez&quot; fine cocktail jazz that envokes visions of an outside cafe in some tropical villa.<br />&quot;Seamus&quot; an innuendo-filled blues number. Probably the weakest song on the album, but fun every now and then.<br />&quot;Echoes&quot; this is the song that really makes the album. The 23 minute epic is rivaled only by &quot;Shine on You Crazy Diamond&quot; or Dark Side of the Moon as a whole. This song captures the essence of climax perfectly if the listener is patient. My advice, if you can space 30 minutes, get some nice headphones and listen to this song the entire way through. David Gilmour's guitar work after the whale calls will leave you breathless. I promise.
B000001OAA|5.0|One of my all-time favorite albums is the 1995 debut disc by Garbage, who, in my opinion, are the world's greatest modern rock band. The group came together when guitarists' Duke Erikson & Steve Marker wanted to form a band with their friend, drummer/producer Butch Vig (who produced Nirvana's classic, \\"Nevermind\\"). But they still needed a singer. One evening the guys are watching MTV, and they see a music video by a band named Angelfish, fronted by a Scottish lass named Shirley Manson. Impressed with Shirley, the Garbage men immediately contact her, and the rest, as they say, is history. Their 1995 self-titled debut album is a fabulous whirlpool blend of bone-crunching rock and shimmering pop, with classy euro-trash production, samples and effects, capped off by Shirley's seductive voice. It arguably remains their best album to date (though I certainly love \\"Version 2.0\\" and \\"beautifulgarbage\\" just fine).There's not a dull track anywhere on \\"Garbage.\\" Whether tearing up the joint on rockers like \\"Supervixen,\\" \\"As Heaven Is Wide,\\" \\"Vow,\\" and \\"My Lover's Box,\\" pumping up the pop on \\"Only Happy When It Rains,\\" \\"Fix Me Now,\\" and the big hit \\"Stupid Girl,\\" or soaring through the atmosphere on songs like \\"Queer,\\" \\"A Stroke Of Luck\\" and \\"Milk,\\" Shirley & the boys are a superb musical force to be reckoned with. They are original, intelligent, crafty, and just plain genius. To my ears, there's no other modern rock band these days that comes close to them. I sure hope that there will be more music to come from Garbage in the near future, 'cause they're that good. \\"Garbage\\" is a stunning album by the kings (and queen) of modern rock. Long may they reign!
B00005K3NY|5.0|What sticks with you from this film, apart from its superlative physical effects, is the unreleting darkness and foreboding created by the sets, lighting, and cinematography.     A vision of powerful forces locked in a conflict and intrusion by unwanted forces into your very thoughts form the basis for a highly disturbing and entertaining film.
0316666343|1.0|I wanted to love this book.  It had been near the top of my books to read list for almost a year and the reviews on Amazon finally persuaded me to go out a grab a copy.  After all, the story was intriguing and I was looking forward to reading something that was a little more complex.  In the end, the only value I got out of the novel was a shelf decoration.  The story had all the makings of an emotional tour de force, yet the only emotion it ever evoked from me was utter frustration after about the 103rd page when I finally gave up on the book.  What surprised me the most was how overly-simplistic the writing was.  The problem was having the story told through the eyes of a fourteen-year old.  As a result, too many passages were devoted to what was seen rather than what was felt by the characters.  The book was like snapshots that only left me yearning for the story behind the pictures.  A novel dealing with a little girl's murder and how it affects her loved ones deserved to be told with more insight than it was in The Lovely Bones.  What a disappointment.
0380807343|2.0|Not to say that Neil Gaiman is a poor writer, because he is surely one of the most imaginative and talented writers out there, but Coraline falls flat and is definitely not his best work. It is an undeveloped story with characters lacking depth. The peripheral characters (Coraline's neighbors) seem be tossed in to add some fleck of color, but add nothing to the experience. I know Gaiman seems to be exploring the children's market with other books like Wolves in the Walls (which is only worth purchasing for the illustrations, really), but his talents lie in other genres and should stick with it. There were some moments that were creepy, I admit, but this story doesn't belong in book form. (It would've made a great Twilight Zone episode). All in all, stay away from Gaiman's children's books and read the Sandman series or his other works intended for grown-ups.
B00005JKZV|1.0|If I was unfamiliar with Tolkien's work I would probably have enjoyed this movie.  (Trying) to look at it in an objective manner, it is good entertainment.  However, if you have read and enjoyed the book(s), you will be grossly disappointed in the movie version.  Although one could argue that the requirements of a 3 +/- hour film preclude a more faithful adaptation or rendering, the amount of time devoted to gratuitous and seemingly pointless additions to the story could have been far better spent in adhering to the original.  <br />Tolkien's work painted a very rich picture, with beautiful renderings of human strengths and weaknesses: nobility and greed; good and evil; honor, duty, and loyalty.  Much that was the best in the texture of story was ripped out or altered for no apparent reason.<br />After watching the movie twice, I re-read the books again.  The amazement and delight of the written work seemed to shine all the more brightly after viewing the movie.<br />On the plus side, I guess it could have been worse.
B00007BH5C|4.0|I bought this CD hoping the song from the trailer for The Two Towers would be on it and it's not!!  The song I wanted is played towards the end of the preview.  That's why I gave this CD 4 out of 5 stars.  It's an excellent compilation; it's just missing the one piece I had most desired!  If anyone knows where I can find it (besides downloading the trailer), please email me!  WintreLJ1402@yahoo.com
B0000C0FJB|5.0|Being a Rush fan ever since Vapor Trails was released has opened new doors in my life.  Since then I have purchased and received as gifts several Rush albums.  Considering what the crew and the band went through before the show, I'd have to say that this is the best live DVD and CD from the hardest working band in rock.  Watching the DVD and listening to the CD for the first time, I would have never known that before the show there were no sound checks, no warm ups, etc.  No one reads a long review so I will keep it short.  RUSH has gained another fan for life.  It was touching to see other fans show thier appreciation for the band that keeps on getting better.  They did this for the fans, and it truly shows by thier work on stage and in the studio, hitting it home to places where other bands do not dare to go.
B0000C0FJB|3.0|I went to the theatre and saw the show first hand on a big screen but the sound was just terrible.  It really pissed me off.  I couldn't hear the drums at all.  Credits are given that Lifeson aided in the mixing and the guitars are definately out front on this one.  I was looking foward to another &quot;Show of hands&quot; only better - due to increasingly sophisticated technology - but this is a sore disappointment over all - simply because the songs are inspired but the recording leaves much to be desired...  Grrrr!
0679731725|5.0|This book deserved its Brooker Prize (and more).  Take a well-written, understated story of a butler adjusting to a new (American) gentleman, put the butler on his first road trip, have the memory of his butler-father intermingle with his trying to make sense of his new world - you get this thought-provoking tale.  What are the limits of professionalism and loyalty?  How does one maintain these qualities in a world in which their definitions appear to be changing?  How does one admit to themselves that clinging to old ways leave one unable to read correctly present situations much less respond correctly?  These questions are explored in a tale of grace and humor.  Recommended.
B0000E65V9|3.0|Regarding Techmarcom's review:  as a long time die hard fan also, I generally agree with most of the points made.  I will buy this cd for the 3rd bonus cd also, and will probably never listen to the first 2 as I aleady have them in other forms. I also have many of the disc 3 songs in other forms, too.  <br />But the one point that Techmarcom makes that I have to chime in on is the point that this cd is not really made for the long time or &quot;die hard&quot; fans.  I think that, generally, these discs are NOT intended for us long time/die hard fans who have all these songs on disc already (or at least most of the songs).  But instead, the discs are mainly a good gift idea for friends and family of these die hards - people that you want to introduce Bruce's music to and need a starting point to do so.  For this purpose alone (and only), these &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; type cds are a great idea.
0156027321|4.0|I really liked this book as I kept reading, as it made me think a great deal about how one looks at the world.  This book is not for those looking for an escape like a historical novel - it's more of a thought starter or discussion starter for reflection on life.
B00008OWZC|3.0|Ok, there are some great moments on these three live discs, I admit it. But, 23 years after this band dis-banded, do we really still need &quot;new&quot; albums from them.  Is Jimmy Page still really hurting this bad for money. I thought he was really just trying to cash in when he did that Coverdale/Page album.  Led Zeppelin is the great hard rock band of all time, but how many more 20 minute versions of their songs do we really need to hear? Get their original albums, and leave it at that.
B00005JLT5|3.0|The story is about a Pianist surviving during the World War II in Poland. How many movies have come on the backdrop of World War II and Germans, Concentration Camp? <br />I was expecting some heroic act by the pianist - at least during the time when he was collecting pistols in the German camp or while throwing guns to the ghetto. Although I do not expect Arnold kind of heroism, I was expecting something a normal human being would do on times of pain. But Alas! I see him hiding and sneaking like a coward from place to place. The pianist was found to survive and worry about food more than thinking anything heroic.There is a dialog &quot;You are great pianist in Poland and in the world&quot; but there were not enough scenes to emphasize and give impact. The director could have deleted couple of scenes on this instead of showing his hunger.<br />Although survival is more important, the Pianist getting help from others and on emergency - did not get any sympathy - but conveyed selfishness. It is true that as a single man you cannot fight the mass but there is nothing to convey that he even felt that.<br />I could not find any great performance by Adrien to win an Oscar. Mediocre acting. But he playing the piano before the German needs appreciation. It is unfortunate that the excellent performance of the Pianist is shown along with the end titles. Thank God I watched in the DVD version so could enjoy - not sure if I would have had the opportunity or patience to watch this in theatre.<br />The movie is boring at times as there is no fight back. Nor one gets motivated. I have not read the actual story but the challenge of converting an autobiography to a movie failed partially.<br />You cannot compare with the epic movie - &quot;Schindler's List&quot;. I recommend &quot;Life is beautiful&quot; more than this.
B0000C0FJB|5.0|I don't know what these Philistines are complaining about. This live CD from Rush is CRAZY GOOD!  The sound is enormous, like the show was.  Now, I agree that without the sound check, the sound crew needed a few songs to help Geddy's vocals to stand out more.  But, hey, take it with a grain of salt!  This is an incredible performance and an amazing show captured here, if somehow not &quot;perfect&quot;.  It's live, man!  Stop nit-picking!  Rush is on top of the world on this night and they celebrated this event with a sound and visual document to preserve it for posterity.  They did a great job and the music ROCKS!  5 stars, at least.  Buy this CD and/or the DVD.  Celebrate the amazing career of Rush.  They deserve the praise!
B0000AXE8I|5.0|Let me just say that this movie works in every way. I'm so tired of people blatently bitching about the overextened action sequences, the poor storyline, and the &quot;lack of mystery of the characters&quot;. Lack of mystery of the characters? Isn't that the whole point of a sequal? How can you anticipate a sequal that will not further develop cahracters and explore new and different material. And there seems to be a fair share of mystery in this movie that ends as a cliffhanger.  <BR>    What many people fail to see is that this is just one part of an entire story, the story being the supposed liberation of the human race. So of course they're going to have to show the city of Zion. Not to waste time, but develop the city of Zion: it's people; it's unity; it's style of living; and perhaps most of all it's peacefulness. I'm quite sure that the dull nature of the scenes of Zion in this movie will be drastically contrasted with the ultra-violent nature that it must undergo in Revolutions.<BR>    As for the action sequences...they're amazing. Beautifully choreographed. There is nothing like them. These action sequences show how Neo is, without a question, The One.<BR>    And as I recall, one of these reviews sais something about having a lack of enlightenment after watching this film. In what sense of the word? I'm sure you are not looking for some life-altering realism from an action/adventure film. If you want enlightenment then you should should study Dante's Inferno or Eliot's The Wasteland, do not look for enlightenment from an ultra-violent sci-fi flick. Don't get me wrong...this movie is very stylish, very original, and has it's share of Biblical allusions. But this series is, in essence, a shootem-up war saga, and the finest of it's kind I might add. I eagerly anticipate the concluding chapter of this amazing series.
B000002NBY|5.0|Listening to this album now, what surprises me is that, after 16 years, it still sounds a bit revolutionary.  I remember that, on first hearing, the experience was a bit like Bob Dylan's sudden appearance with an electric guitar.  All of a sudden the musician I expected had turned into someone else entirely.  And, after the initial period of adjustment, I liked what I was hearing.<br />By drawing from an entire set of different traditions, including a style of African music that no mainstream American had any idea even existed, Paul Simon synthesized a musical form which combined ingenious and tuneful lyrics with infectious rhythms.  As I found out when I finally managed to get to his concert, people actually got up and danced to this music - and kept on dancing all night.<br />What is completely original, isn't the music, but Simon's lyrics.  He moves from a serious, and not always subtle, political statements like The Boy in the Bubble or All Around the World to intensely personal monologues like Graceland.  He has an ability to turn a phrase and hare off unexpectedly that always leaves me with a renewed respect for the capabilities of the English language.<br />As such this album has remained once of my all time favorites.  The legacy of a singer whose work has marked many of the phases of my life.  Just when I get down a bit he manages to remind me that I too am still crazy after all of these years.
B00009W0U4|5.0|I gave this film 5 stars because it's one of the most challenging films I've ever sat through. Any filmmaker with this much audacity and imagination has my attention. The credits roll in reverse (as in \\"Kiss Me Deadly\\") and the film does the same. It opens with a horrifying descent into a horrifying gay S&M club called the Rectum by a crazed Marcus (Vincent Cassel) searching for a character called Tenio (tapeworm) with his friend Pierre (Albert Dupontel) desperately trying to stop him. The camera work in this scene does gymnastics and is dizzying and uncomfortable. They find Tenio (or so they think) and when he breaks Marcus' arm, Pierre grabs a fire extinguisher and pulverizes the man's face. What follows are the events (in reverse) that lead up to this violent encounter including one of the most repulsive rape scenes I've ever seen in a film. I had to look away a couple of times. Marcus is in love with Alex (Monica Bellucci) who left Pierre for him. They're all still good friends. But at a party, Marcus does coke and gets out of hand causing Alex to walk out without him---leading to the vicious rape. All of this supposedly takes place over the course of a day and may or may not be a fantasy indulged in by Alex. Whatever your interpretation is of this film will no doubt influence whether you like it or not. The violence is incredible and stomach churning. Yet the film goes from all out horror to softer and softer scenes until it reaches a dream-like conclusion---which is actually the beginning. And therein lies the mystery. Was it all just a fantasy or was it real? The acting is excellent, especially Dupontel as Pierre who, as we see in reverse, goes from ballistic violence to an eloquent, gentle intellectual. Alex left Pierre because he wasn't exciting. So the fantasy aspect does have some credence. Anyway, viewers should beware the box warning of graphic violence. Once you get past this, if possible, \\"Irreversible\\" is a most curious film. But not for the squeamish.
B0000CD5FN|5.0|I, like so many others still cannot believe the death of legend Joe Strummer.  It would only go to figure just as Joe and the Mescaleros are starting to really put out some awesome music the untimely end would come.  &quot;Streetcore&quot; was just released earlier today and I have listened to it continuously and I am truly impressed with the entire effort.  From the music and lyrics to the production of the disc, the Mescaleros truly put their hearts behind this album.  Strummer's voice is strong as usual and mature enough where he knows how to use it better than ever.  The band is tighter than ever and you can tell they are all having a good time of it all!  Each of the 10 songs are standouts of their own from &quot;Coma Girl&quot; to the surprising rendition of Bob Marley's &quot;Redemption Song&quot;, who else could pull off a version of it like Strummer??? No One!  It is also good to see that &quot;Long Shadow&quot; was included, Joe wrote it for one of the recent Johnny Cash &quot;American series&quot; albums and it did not make that cut, but the song is truly a Strummer classic! &quot;All in a day&quot; reminds me of some of the work Joe did with Mick Jones' Big Audio Dynamite's &quot;No. 10 Upping Street&quot; (as writer/producer). As I said I can go on and on, the album is awesome, and at times haunting, Joe, you will not be forgotten!!  The packaging of the CD is tastefully done, and remindful of the old days if you are a Clash fan with quotes and what we would see as half thoughts or Strummer catch phrases.  I have only one complaint about the whole album, I was hoping there would be more of a tribute to Joe in the liner notes, the man was an absolute legend and steam rolled the way for many of these &quot;so called&quot; punk rockers and revolutionary rockers.  Buy this disc!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!  The world can only hope there are some other hidden Strummer works that can be released one day!
B00008EY9G|5.0|&quot;Identity&quot; is one of those psychological thrillers where you really have to pay attention or you get lost. It's an engrossing mix of creepy murder thriller and character study that draws you in quickly and doesn't let up. A group of disparate strangers winds up at an eerie run down motel in a brutal rainstorm and find themselves being picked off one by one by a mysterious killer. Meanwhile, a schizophrenic mass murderer is scheduled for execution but his psychiatrist is arguing for an insanity reprieve. The stranded strangers discover that they have odd things in common. And then there are the motel room keys left as macabre clues. A truly great cast includes John Cusack as a limo driver, Ray Liotta as a cop, Amanda Peet as a call girl, Clea Duvall as an unhappy newlywed, John Hawkes as the loopy motel &quot;manager&quot; and Alfred Molina as the psychiatrist with Taylor Pruitt Vance as the schizophrenic and Rebecca DeMornay in an all too brief role as a hotheaded TV star being driven by Cusack. Other actors in the cast are good too. Director James Mangold keeps things moving with no room for draggy spots and each character has secrets---their own &quot;baggage&quot; so to speak. How the two plots come together is truly bizarre and beautifully handled. I found the ending to be a let down, but actually it made sense in a frustrating way.  So I recommend &quot;Identity&quot; for those who enjoy a genuinely spooky story and murder mystery with a twist. Watching the cast alone is worth watching the movie for.  Good extras on the DVD, too.
0385509456|5.0|Haddon is a subtle and sensitive writer, leaving it to us to draw the conclusions that Christopher can't. His precise and careful prose reveal just enough to keep us a step ahead of Christopher - and give us an ominous sense of dark relevations waiting in the wings - while retaining a suspenseful mood throughout the narrative. In the end, though, the only mystery here is one that's beyond Christopher's, or anyone's, power to solve: how people can be so brutal, violent, and cruel to each other in the name of love.

0156027321|5.0|When I first received Life of Pi, I thought that it might be a little boring. Boy was I wrong! This book has a lot to offer.<BR>The character's are interesting and the settings are exotic. You enjoy Pi's journey and find yourself hoping he makes it to shore safely!<br />I suggest this book for teens and above due to the sometimes graphic things that happen to animals and people alike.
B00006879E|4.0|Not too many bands can combine a broad range of styles and have it sound this good! You can hear soul that will remind you of Motown, boy band pop with more testosterone, classic rock like Cream all put together in a funky, groovy, feel-good way. The classic ups and downs of love are what many of the songs are about and you can still listen to it over and over again. A must add to any music lover's CD collection.

B0000AXE8I|4.0|What can you say about this film that hasn't been said already?  Maybe it didn't live up to the hype.  But with these kinds of expectations to fulfill how could it?<br />Here are my thoughts on The Matrix Reloaded in descending order of what worked well: action sequences - spectacular; music - great, really pulse-pounding; acting - passable; plot - hard to follow the first time through.  Finally, there were a couple scenes that appeared unnecessarily risque and gratuitous.<br />The bevy of DVD special features should please most people.  The MTV Movie Awards clip is very amusing.  Audio commentaries and outtakes would've rounded off the extras perfectly but sadly, aren't included.<br />The Matrix Reloaded is a good, not great, movie.  There's just not a lot of revolutionary material here.  Don't expect the high level of surprise and awe the first film delivered.  Watch it with that frame of mind and you won't be disappointed.
B000067IZ3|5.0|A lot of movies that are about drugs describe the substance and shows it's effects on the characters who use them. Here, Steven Soderbergh directs a movie that shows the battles, losses, and meager victories between the authorities, the two sided faces, and the people who sell and supply. A great plus about the film is that even though there are three stories to be told, and they do have some significance to each other. Soderbergh makes sure that you don't get overloaded or confused. Each part has enough to give, and every piece that follows comes one at a time. There are no sides taken to any situation, even though there are characters who obviously make seedy and corrupt decisions. You are watching it from a filmmaker who wants to bring you how it is: ugly, slimy, brutal, and quite exausting. <br />Michael Douglas is more than fine as America's new drug czar. He later finds out that his own daughter, played by Erika Christensen, has succome to drugs herself. This makes an irony and brings a much larger pressure onto their household. <br />Beninco Del Toro, in an excellent Oscar winning performance, is Mexican police officer Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez, who along with his friend and police partner Manolo Sanchez (Jacob Vargas), find their clever ways of police work favoured by a General Salazar, who offers them work, money, and protection for helping him with his so called claim to bring down a major drug cartel. <br />Meanwhile, San Diego housewife Catherine Zeta Jones is shocked to find her husband arrested, without knowing why, until their lawyer (Dennis Quaid) relenquishes the reasons, which will surprise her indefinitly. <br />Everyone has a lot on their plate. And although we are sympathizing for Douglas' father and Amy Irving's mother as they try not to let their teen daughter slip further into susbstance abuse, there is an interesting take on the possibilities of what wrongs we are all capable of. Del Toro's character wants to do right, yet his police paycheque is such poverty, and the competing drug runners they apprehend for their druglord boss are large and powerful people. Javier and Manolo are good at what they do, so this new opportunity gives  them something they didn't have as Tijuana cops: excitement and more money. Now they are hotshots. However, an underlying guilt of it all haunts Javier like a ghost. <br />Everyone here has more than a job to do. With such a field of excellent actors, from Miguel Ferrer as a cocky drug runner, Topher Grace as the unfixable punk Seth, or Benjmain Bratt in a terrific cameo as the head of the Obregon Brothers drug empire, they all make the film more interesting to watch, yet what I also liked is how nobody crowds the film and their time in front of the camera, considering the large number of actors and actresses there are. <br />I really have to say that Don Cheadle and Luiz Guzman as the duo of DEA agents who survey Zeta Jones's every move, are my favourite to watch. They aren't these crisp super hero agents you see in other films. They're simply a pair of the agency's best, remaining very relatable as real people, but very driven when their job takes them to the front of the action. And since they're friends, they also make some good funny moments, joking about this, or bickering about that, without turning the movie far away from any of the movie's purpose.<br />The violence and substance abuse isn't way over the top, but when the drugs and guns do show up, it isn't pretty either. The story is really well written, and doesn't throw you around. It could have, considering the material's volume. I can't think of a better movie that has a lot to say and a lot to show without confusing you.  <br />A sombering low key soundtrack adds to the film's gritty and surreal mood. And the acting is terrific. There hasn't been a better ensemble of actors than in this film, and with the terrific storyline and directing, I hope they leave this movie alone from any sequal ideas or such. It said what needs to be said, and we'll know how things will go on after the film ends.

B00005JH9W|5.0|For anyone who thinks \\"Freaks\\" is merely exploitation, guess what?  You're right.  Cinema is all exploitation. To exploit means \\"to make the most of\\" or \\"achieve highest expression,\\" and that is exactly what director Tod Browning does with his 1932 masterpiece, \\"Freaks.\\"  He takes a rather simple story: greedy trapeze artist foiling a love-struck midget into a marriage of convenience, and makes it special. First, he populates it with real-life \\"freaks,\\" (a term that in today's p.c. world makes one shudder) allowing them to speak their own voices. Sure, their acting is not exactly Oscar-caliber, but neither is that of the ensemble cast of Visconti's neorealistic, \\"La Terra Trema,\\" and yet, the latter film ranks amongst the world's all-time greats. Browning's film is not a horror film by any means. It may be frightening or disturbing, but its effectiveness stems from a deeper realm of cinematic mastery. Browning seems to use more artistic freedom here than he had been allowed in his earlier Universal classic, \\"Dracula,\\" and the result is pure magic. While \\"perfect\\" is not an adjective that one would readily apply to \\"Freaks,\\" (and by the way, even \\"Citizen Kane\\" contains some interesting technical and/or creative flaws), let it be said that like other chilling classics, such as Herk Harvey's \\"Carnival of Souls\\" (1960), and Hitchcock's \\"Psycho\\" (1960), \\"Freaks\\" may well be one of the most inspirational movies for aspiring filmmakers and avid film buffs ever made. It is complex in its simplicity; it is tragic in its purity; and ultimately, it is the stuff that celluloid dreams are made of... just ask David Lynch if \\"Freaks\\" entered his mind while he was making \\"The Elephant Man.\\"
B0000C7PQK|5.0|I always get very excited when a new Enigma album comes out and this time was no different. The best tracks on this are the title track &quot;Voyageur&quot;, &quot;Boum Boum&quot; a silly but great dance track and &quot;Following The Sun&quot; the final, and probably best song on the album. Ruth Ann of Olive guest vocals on this track and the results are great! This album takes getting used to ,but once you do, you can't stop playing it!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|It seems that alot of the negative reviews here are because this album does not sound like TOOL or APC's brilliant debut.  <br />First of all, this is not TOOL.  This is an exceptionaly talented group of musicians that have come together to make beautiful music and the vocalist for this project happens to be Maynard James Keenan from TOOL.  <br />Secondly, If you want want every album to sound like the last you could always buy the entire AC/DC catalog and be done with it. I honestly did not expect this album to be better than Mer De Noms, but I believed that it would be at least as good.  My expectations were definitely exceeded mainly due to the fact that it is a bit different than their debut album.<br />After three weeks of repeated listening this Album has moved closer and closer to the top of my list of all time favorites. I think Thirteenth Step is only beginning to creep into my conciousness with its moody and other-worldly tones that definitely draw me into the lyrical journey that Maynard has mapped out so perfectly.<br />This album definitely requires you to listen to it multiple times in order to appreciate the rich textures and thought provoking lyrics.
0689835604|5.0|The drawings are cute and the flaps are surprisingly durable (though they definitely wear).  We got this book for my daughter at 7 months and she loved it.  We're still reading it daily at 10 months.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|Ok, so i've been patiently sitting through these &quot;reviews&quot; of this movie, and I'm seeing a growing trend: a severe misappreciation of this film. people, for crying out loud, it is the MIDDLE movie. therefore, the expectations should be lowered somewhat. Also, I'm sick of people complaning that the &quot;mystery&quot; is gone from the movie. You want mystery, go watch a MYSTERY movie. it seems pointless to come to an action movie and walk away disappointed because the mystery surrounding the first one is gone! ANd of course, there is the infamous ZION scene. OH NO. the screen is showing an event that probably goes on in 100,000 diffeerent locations across the US on any given night. but funny, i don't hear a general outcry to shut those raves down! If people feel like being hypocrites, they should at least be intelligent about it. Lastly, there seems to be a great deal of complaint directed towards Keanu Reeves. Granted, he blows as an actor. But i must say that i didn't really go into Reloaded looking for Oscar performances. I went for the action, and for the numerous, and usually well thought out plot twists. NOT TO SEE AN OSCAR WINNING PERFORMANCE. Oh, and one last little thing that's annoying me. Some of my more intelligent friends claim that the film tries too hard with its philosophy, and fails miserably. More specifically, they refer to it as &quot;lite&quot; philosophy, claiming that the ideas really arent that revolutionary, or even that interesting. I seem to be constantly explaining to them that such a process is necessary to make the philosophy accessable to the general public. But at the bottom of it all, it's an entertaining action movie with excellent special effects. For those to wrapped up in themselve to appreciate, i have only pity.
B00005N8JG|5.0|One of the tracks from Opalescent was included on a new age sampler CD attached to the front of Nature and Health magazine, which is where I first heard it. The more I listened to the track, the more I wanted the album, but trying to locate Opalescent in Australia was quite difficult. Luckily I managed to find it - finally! - and it has proved to be the best purchase I've ever made, music-wise. This guy is phenomenal, especially considering his age (21). My music collection includes a huge amount of Vangelis, Jarre, Tangerine Dream and most of the heavies of chillout, electronic and ambient music, but I think I wound up listening to tracks from Opalescent at least once or twice a day for literally months - more than anything I've ever owned. Hopkins' music is utterly mesmerizing. It creates an ambient atmosphere unlike anything I've ever heard before. Everything flows together. This will sound cliched, but if you only ever buy one chillout album, let this one be it. I cannot recommend it highly enough, it is one of those one-in-a-million perennially listenable albums that I'm sure I will never tire of.
B00005UEAR|4.0|Buy this CD for the first disc that has the best songs the band has produced since 1994's &quot;Awake.&quot;<br />They shouldn't have bothered with the second CD, however, so neither do I and neither should you.  I guess they needed to justify the title or something.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Dang, she did it again. this album is hot, u must get.<BR>just about every song is relateable.  if u haven't got this yet, u need to GO GET IT!  the songs are touching and moving. my favorite is makeover.

Aside from the nasty and horrible critiques and comments that she receives, Christina is truly an artist and this is portrayed through her music.  <br />GO GET IT!<BR>Lots of love Christina!
B0000DG00B|5.0|I have wondered for a long time when this was going to be released. This 2 cd set contains both of the Allman Brothers Band's performances from the Atlanta International Pop Festival in July of 1970.  &quot;Every Hungry Woman&quot; from the first set was previously released on the &quot;Mycology&quot; compilation and scorching versions of &quot;Statesboro Blues&quot; and &quot;Whipping Post&quot; from the second set were released on the &quot;Great Festivals of the Seventies&quot; lp in 1971.  Highlights of the first set include an inspired version of &quot;Dreams&quot; and the Berry Oakley vocal spotlight &quot;Hoochie Coochie Man&quot;.  The band was really locked in by the time of the second set.  From the barnstorming opener &quot;Don't Keep Me Wonderin'&quot; the intensity never fails. After the aformentioned slide workout &quot;Statesboro Blues&quot; the band performs one of the best ever versions of &quot;In Memory Of Elizabeth Reed&quot;.  Duane and Dickey trade licks like there is no tomorrow.  An emotional reading of T-Bone Walker's &quot;Stormy Monday&quot; follows with a great vocal by Gregg.  Berry Oakley's lead bass kick starts the runaway version of concert favorite &quot;Whipping Post&quot; played jazzier than usual.  Just when you think the intensity can not get any higher the best ever version of &quot;Mountain Jam&quot; clocks in next at around 28 minutes.  Johnny Winter joins in on the jam to make it more interesting than usual.  It contains a monster bass solo by the underrated Berry Oakley and great jazzy drum interplay between Butch Trucks and Jaimoe.  The guitars of Duane and Dickey just soar and Gregg adds some interesting keyboard fills to the mix.  Old friend Thom Doucette adds his tasty harmonica playing to a number of songs on the set.  The first set also contains a good version of Muddy Waters' &quot;Trouble No More&quot; which was not played during the second set.  Some have called the Allman Brothers Band of this time period the greatest live American rock band.  This new set &quot;Live at the Atlanta International Pop Festival&quot; ranks right up there with &quot;At Fillmore East&quot; and after hearing these two live sets I'm inclined to agree.  The new 2 cd set is the next best thing to being there!  If you like this set by all means pick up the Deluxe Edition of &quot;At Fillmore East&quot; that was recently reissued.  The new Deluxe Edition of that set contains at least one version of every song played during this historic run of concerts. Hopefully some of the performances of the other bands that played at the Atlanta International Pop Festval like Ten Years After, Mountain, Johnny Winter, Jethro Tull etc. will be released in the future.
B00004DTLI|5.0|This bad boy cooks. I listened to it every morning on the way to school in my best friend's old beat-up Monte Carlo jamming to an 8 Track player rigged up to play out of some house speakers in the back seat. This is pure British Blues Metal served up Hot 'n Nasty. And for what it's worth, this sounds nothing like their late 80's tripe, and that's a good thing.
B000092ZYX|5.0|This record grew on me. At first, I did not like it, and I love Radiohead! I listened for a couple of weeks, and one day, I started hearing it. It is now one of my favorite records. I think Thom York is a fairly passionate fellow. If you ever doubted this, listen to this record. This is one of the best reords of the year.<br />Vivillo
6305426694|4.0|If like me, you're something of a sucker for socially conscious movies, flicks with their hearts in the right place, then A CIVIL ACTION is definitely a must-see for you.  In terms of facing complex moral and legal issues (not always the same thing, in fact often miles apart), writer director Steven Zaillian seldom takes the easy way out.  The film rings true on those fronts--although he does frequenly engage in a kind of cinematic shorthand that compresses time and events and I do believe there are some of those &quot;composite characters&quot; so ubiquitous in true-life films.<br />Still it's commendable effort.  If you like courtroom drama at all, you will appreciate the wheeling and dealing and the high stakes human drama going down here.  The cast list suggests that there will be some quirky characterization going on, if not a downright acting feast.   Any movie that boasts Robert Duvall, James Gandolfini, William H. Macy and John Lithgow can't go wrong on the acting front, right?  Well, yes and no, they all turn in fine performances.  Only Macy and Duvall get to do anything really quirky though.<br />Others have suggested that John Travolta is somewhat miscast here.  I disagree.  He makes a believable transition from money grubbing ambulance chaser to impassioned champion of the common man (woman and CHILD).  Not easy to do in the space of a couple of hours.  Jonathan Harr had over 500 pages to tell that tale.  Harr tells it better, but Travolta and Zaillian do a credible job, given the limitations of cinema.<br />A CIVIL ACTION is a worthy effort.  Certainly not perfect, but many will find it provocative.  Most will find it well worth their time.  These days, when you seldom see anything like the classic socially conscious filmmaking, so common from the 30s to the 70s, it's heartening to see a film this intelligent and authentic.  (Why can't all these notorious Hollywood Liberals make a halfway decent liberal film anymore?)  This is a film well worth your time.
B00006LLNU|5.0|Beautiful, edgy, layered, stark, sparse, mysterious, lush, simple, spiritual, full of soul, fresh. There is no artist or band or musician in the business of music making music this enchanting. This is their best record yet.<br />Vivillo
B0000A98ZP|5.0|This movie is with out a doubt the quintessential teen movie.  This is the movie by which other teen movies go by.  This movie no matter how old you are never gets old.  In fact I have a hard time watching this movie without quoting it word for word. The movie starts off great. With the quote from David Bowie to how each member of the prat pack arrives. Right after that you find yourself laughing from start to finish. From clips like &quot;The door is way to heavy sir&quot; to &quot;Chicks can't hold their smoke that's what it is.&quot; This movie may not have real heavy depth, but it does have some depth.  The way in which actully get into the truth about what high school is all about instead of skirting around the edges is great.  Even thought it was made in the 80's school all over the world are still the same way. This movie is the cult classic. The one that start it all.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|There's a slew of people out there that did not like this movie (I am not one of them, however) and I think I've discovered why:  if you're looking for another movie just like the first Matrix, you're going to be disappointed.  The Matrix was truly a mind-blowing movie in and of itself...the plotline, the effects, the fighting style.  At the time, everything about it was different and completely unique.  But you have to consider that that movie was the &quot;introduction&quot; to the world of the Matrix.  That very small universe was bound to expand, and that is exectly what happens in Reloaded.  Remember, it's not called &quot;The Matrix Rehashed.&quot;  Reloaded may suffer from a bit of a &quot;middle child&quot; syndrome, in that the concept is no longer new, but it provides no resolution at it's end either.  We are introduced to so many new charaters and locales, which can be a little disconcerting at first.  But let me break some of the more major points down here:<br />Zion:  Why do people hate these scenes so much?  No doubt many had already formed a picture in their mind of what the city would look like, and it probably just didn't fit in with their image.  Ultimately, I think their visit to Zion was necessary though.  You need to actually see the people that these characters are fighting to save.  On the whole though?  The Zion scenes take up so little time in the whole of the movie, who cares really?<br />The fight scenes:  The Burly Brawl IS a bit over the top...but that's what it's supposed to be.  Admittedly, I was ready for it to be over, but it was still a special effects feat.  Everything else is very much in keeping with the first movie.<br />The car chase:  Some people thought it dragged on...I thought it was mezmerizing.  The effects were truly extraordinary and the concept of why the freeway is so dangerous to our heroes make it all that much more exciting.  What's a true action movie without a big car chase?  This one puts all others to shame.<br />The big &quot;talk&quot;:  Ah yes, Neo's infamous conversation with the architect of the Matrix.  Is it dry?  Like a desert.  Is it completely confusing the first time through?  Completely.  Is the rhetoric a bit puffed-up and imposing?  Definitely.  Is it helpful to watch the DVD with the subtitles on?  Absolutely.  I've watched it multiple times and I still feel like I'm missing something.  I guess you either get it or you don't.<br />You cannot take a movie like this too seriously.  If you do, it suddenly becomes pretentious and annoying.  But it IS just a movie, and should be taken as such.  Sure, there's some potentially serious philosophical points, namely the power of choice and the power of love.  And heck, that makes for some good conversation fodder.  But lets get right down to it:  this movie is pure eye candy, that happens to have a decent storyline and an attractive, talented cast to boot.  As a side note, the second DVD has some worthy extras, especially the documentary about the making of the big car chase, and the MTV Movie Awards snippet is hysterical as well.  <br />Bottom line:  If you're looking for more of the first movie, you're setting yourself up for disappointment.  Viewing for pure entertaiment?  Watch on!
B00005BL2A|4.0|The return of Depeche Mode could not have been better. Andrew Fletcher, Dave Gahan and Martin Gore got together with producer Mark Bell (best known for producing Bjork) in 2000 to record Exciter. Pre-production work was made by Mr. Gore together with his friend Paul Freegard and engineer Gareth Jones.<BR>DM started recording this album in London in Rak studios, then they moved to Electric lady studios in New York, where they spent a few weeks and after that they went to Santa Barbara and worked 3 months more. They finished recording and mixing the album in London again. <BR>You can feel the good vibe in the band when you listen to the album. Dave Gahan's voice sounded better than ever. \\"Dream on\\" is the first single from the album, a combination with acoustic guitar and electronics and a catchy chorus sang by the three piece. \\"The sweetest condition\\", the third track on the album shows what atmosphere in a song is, DM never used guitars in the way they used them in these one. \\"When the body speaks\\" is a ballad sang very simple by Mr. Gahan and with a chords arrangements made by his friend Knox Chandler. \\"Dead of night\\" could be the strangest song in the album, but also very powerful. \\"Freelove\\" also shows that Gore's lyrics still touch people the way that very few songwriters could do it. The input of Airto Pereira (percussionist) is also important on this track. \\"I feel loved\\" changed completely in the studio, according to what the band members said about this song. It's a hit on the dance floors. Martin Gore took vocals to perform \\"Breathe\\" and \\"Comatose\\" and the last song on the album called \\"Goodnight lovers\\" is just perfect for an end, a very simple lullaby, great lyrics and Dave's voice sounds like whispering the song. I would recommend this album to all kind of people, those especially whose don't have a DM record in their collection.
B00004YKUY|5.0|I don't understand why this wasn't a smash hit.. sure its got a 80's sound..  but if you like very well done melodic guitar work and a vocalist that moves you with every word I don't know how you couldn't love this CD.  I am a guy and many of these songs (and I love all of them) make me want to weep.  No other CD has ever done this to me.  The emotion from Steve is sometimes overwhelming to me.  And all of the music is well written..  If you are tired of the boring downbeat music of today pick this baby up. Listen to it twice and you will have a hard time putting it away for very long.  Thanks Neal for showing us how to make a guitar talk..  you are truly talented. And Steve, no matter how many comments you get about being a Perry dupe.. keep it up...  You have something Perry never had... trust me.
B00005JKZV|1.0|we could not finish this movie. One long noisy chase seen<BR>with cliche heros and villians. At least we didnt spend the <BR>theater money on it. The entire 3 segments might have made one<BR>decent 90 minute movie.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|This CD is excellent!  The music is a mix between pop and rock with some softer songs as well.  In my opinion the Russian release is 700 times better but for those of you who can't stand singing along with another language this CD will do.  Absolutly a must have for your collection.
B000000H57|5.0|Many good detailed reviews have already been posted on here. I really can't add too much more. <BR>October Rust continues to be one of my all time favorite albums, especially in the Autumn. Type O is a unique gothic rock band delivering chillingly haunting melodies of sex, pain, love, hate and death intertwined with a passion for Mother nature. Vocalist Peter Steele (whose voice I can only explain humorously as that of Dracula at the opera) delivers a unique wit to his style, something that is usually absent with \\"Goth\\" music. Humor is evident on the first two tracks and of course on \\"My Girlfriend's Girlfriend\\". Every song on here is hauntingly beautiful. Peter can express emotions that can bring me to tears on \\"Red Water\\" and send chills down my spine on \\"Love You to Death\\". The only other vocalist out there that can stir such emotion in me is Trent Reznor. All this and at same time, Type O Negative is somehow heavy enough to be hard rock. You would never think that \\"four dead trees\\" could sound so good! (Peter once chose these words to describe the look of the band) Thank you TON for this magical collection of emotions.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|the drum beats that you hear throughout the album keep you wanting more and more.  I bought this cd wondering if i would hear a song better than weak and powerless, and i think there are 3-4 songs better......BUY THIS ALBUM, YOU WONT REGRET IT!!!
0345440900|5.0|I was given this book before the birth of my first child and I love it.  The style of writing was a bit annoying but bascially I really thought the advice was excellent.  I'm actually really really shocked at some of the negative comments I read about this book.  I think that the most important take home message for me was to try to figure out ALL my babies cues for what she needed and trust my motherly instinct (that is, listen to advice from others but trust my instinct for what is right for my baby).  For me, in order to do this, the flexible schedule Ms Hogg suggests  makes all the difference in the world, both for the baby and the rest of the family (seriously, which of us do not strive on a flexible schedule, for example, we look forward to leaving work at a particular time of day everyday and eating dinner with our family at a certain time also, many people look forward to watchiing TV at particular times).  <br />I had to go look through my copy of \\"The Baby Whisperer\\" when I read some of the negative comments in order to make sure I had the same book that was being discussed as I thought the book made so much sense.  The comments where people said their baby was miserable because they were underfed was quite mysterious to me.  I believe that Ms Hogg purports that what we need to do is listen to the cues of our babies and react to that.  If they are hungry, feed them!!  Please don't starve your children.  She does suggest a schedule, but it is a flexible one, one that may take more than a few days to establish.  Everyone strives on routine to some extent, why shouldn't we develop a routine that our babies can come to expect and feel comfortable knowing, to some extent, what will happen next in the new bright big world they've come into? <br />About breasatfeeding, it was not my impression that she suggested or advocated that women not breastfeed, she simply laid out the reality that some women either will not be able to breast feed, or choose not to.  What'sthe big deal, if you want to breastfeed (which by the way I think is best if Mom is healthy) then breast feed and skip over the parts that address the women who will not!  <br />In the final analysis, I think Ms Hogg suggests that a flexible schedule helps both the baby and the rest of the family get into a comfortable routine so that everyone's needs are met, especially the baby and that in the end, you have to what works best for your family, not anyone elses...who can't agree with that?!
0385504209|4.0|Although wrapped as a thriller, this nailbiting yarn from Brown braces a controversial subject. Little surprise then that it has provoked such pointless debate here in the reviews. Funny, because a bit of literaly license is not uncommon, e.g., in the description of the Pyramids in &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; (Agatha Christie), or old England imagery from Sherlock Holmes, or the veracity of &quot;Blairwitch Project.&quot; This is not intended as a documentary, it is fiction, so it is in fact quite a positive thing that it mirrors reality SO closely.<br />As a sinister thriller with a killer plot, be prepared to immerse in speculation, action and intrigue. Fascinating. As a book about religion or cults, assuming that really gets your goat, well it will incite you to get to your keyboard (as it did me) and that's a good thing, people!<br />A highly recommended book to own. I could even stand an entire second reading!
6304806418|5.0|This has to be one of the best films of all time. Madonna is at her peak on the singing, dancing, and everything. There's nothing I would change. The music is so wonderful that it will be stuck in your head constantly. Anyone would fall in love with this film. (of all ages)

0553103547|5.0|The entire series of A Song of Fire and Ice (or, at least, the entire portion that has already been published) is a brilliant epic about Heroes, War, Kingdoms, Love, Vengeance, Magic, Dragons, Tragedy, Hope, and much, much more. It is beautifully written from the perspectives of all of the major characters-- and every single character is crafted and developed with honest, detailed precision. The beauty of Martin's method is that he presents you a tale that you can understand from the viewpoints of every major player, and every player has intense strengths and weaknesses that they stay true to in the book, which allows you not only to cheer on the characters that you grow to love, but also respect the characters you grow to hate. In a way, it also makes the book both unpredictable and predictable.<br />As I mentioned before, the book has something for everyone: Battles, strategy, swordplay, and honor for those who like to read about warfare and knighthood. Magic, Oracles, and Alchemy for those who are intrigued by sorcery. Dragons, Giants, and Direwolves for those who like mystical creatures. Marriages, Affairs, and Romance for those into the lovey dovey stuff. Plus Assassins, Theives, Rebels, Corruption, Betrayal, Spies, and more...

B00005JLWN|5.0|Truly a visual delight that could take the Matrix on for 10 rounds and come out swinging. Vaguely Orwellian, this film is about a futuristic world in which emotions are outlawed in order to prevent a 4th World War. One of the enforcers of this rule is Preston, (Christian Bale), a so-called cleric in this world, dispensing order among the sense offenders. In order to eradicate all emotion in the population, drugs are administered daily to wipe out all feelings. When Preston doesn't take his dosage one morning, his entire world is upheaved as he experiences for the first time the feelings and emotions of the world around him. <BR>With some truly stunning fight scenes that rival movies like the Matrix and the Transporter, prepared to be awed as this movie runs it course, ultimately leaving you thirsting for more.
B0000009TJ|5.0|This is the first FZ album I ever heard. My electric bass teacher lent it to me after I keenly asked him \\"Whose song is this?\\" at a concert where a band played \\"Let's Move To Cleveland.\\" I loved the song immediately, and upon listening to it on disc I didn't only love it for its [to me, at the time] eccentric melody, but also for the guitar solo, which I was to find a typical example of Zappa's personal way of soloing.<br />At close to 130 minutes of music this may be the perfect (and a \\"light\\") Zappa introduction to no-know-persons. Although most of the material is taken from FZ's late 60's through mid 70's repertoire, or what some might call his hey day rock material, big variations (thanks to re-arrangements) are being made, and styles vary. There's also a bunch of classic rock covers, such as \\"Purple Haze,\\" \\"Sunshine of Your Love,\\" \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" among others - even the \\"Bonanza\\" theme is included. All cover songs are worth listening to - they're extremely extreme! After listening to any of them for the first time there is NO WAY the words \\"Just what I expected\\" will escape from your sincere mouth.<br />What differs the old FZ studio songs from these 15-to-20-years-later-live-versions are the arrangements and the lyrics. A lot of the lyrics are humorously replaced on the spot (the band seems to have a really good time) and close to all songs on this album feature a horn section armed with five men who handle 10 different horns.<br />From what I understand, the '88 tour band (the last of Zappa's rock bands) knew 196 songs - songs that Zappa could call off at concerts at any time, and it truly shows that this band have practiced A LOT! The musicianship is, as on many of Zappa's albums, EXTRAORDINARY.<br />As a musician I can deeply recommend it for inspiration to anyone involved in musical activities.<br />As an \\"innocent bystander\\" I recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor who wants to enjoy well performed quality music, but if you're looking for an album to cry to while enjoying a bowl-size glass of white wine and looking out the window at the pouring rain, questioning the meaning of life and death, then this is ABSOLUTELY NOT it.<br />To Zappa-fanatics who don't own this album I must ask \\"Fanatic, are you kidding?\\"enjoying a bowl-size glass of white wine and looking out the window at the pouring rain, questioning the meaning of life and death, then this is ABSOLUTELY NOT it.  To Zappa-fanatics who don't own this album I must ask \\"Fanatic, are you kidding?\\"
B000002KBU|1.0|Joni sounds oh so sad and depressed on this album, like she lost her best friend. I want to paint her a happy face, and remind her there is so much more to life than unrequited love. Please Joni, keep your chin up, and smile, if only for a little while. Damn those blues away!!!!!!!!!!!.
B00005JKC3|2.0|Apart from when the Hulk is on the screen, this film suffers from Eric Banality! and Ang Lee hits a career low in total misdirection. Okay, don't get me wrong, Ang Lee probably said to himself \\"Okay, this movie is about the Hulk but it is also about family relationships, genetics and all these other things that should make this action film a little better\\" which is good, but then he goes and directs a version of the Hulk that is anything but action packed at all and it ends up being a really sloppy soap-opera with zero drama or suspense.<br />Eric Bana is usually great but here he delivers a totally flat performance. The story is extremely convoluted and while it tries so hard to be MARVEL, Lee just can not stop himself from playing with the AVID and while he toys with his new montage to make the film look like a comic (great idea but overused!), he forgets to EDIT the film at all. It does not even register as a Superhero movie and starts to move into \\"Disaster Flick\\" territory only to be completely confused about itself. At the same time Lee is trying to make the film more adult but misses the connection there and kids will be bored to death with what little he has provided for them in terms of the hulk smashing things up which is what they want to see.<br />Its a film that does not know what it wants to be. In short, another director may have been a better choice and the film screams Edit me! Maybe this is one of the first movies that should receive a new directors cut where the film is actually 30 minutes shorter. Having said that the special effects are very good but there is not enough action sequences to actually make it worth your while.<br />Its no Spiderman by a long shot.
068484267X|4.0|ANGELA'S ASHES- FRANK MC COURT<br />Angela's ashes, follows one boys quest through the harsh catholic life of Limerick, fighting for survival in a land of poverty. Frank learns to deal with many expected and unexpected happenings, and in the end fulfils his childhood aspirations. Drunken fathers, sin and begging are features,which sum up the main storyline of the novel.<BR>  This novel is a non - fictional memoir of a childhood is filled with adventure, poverty and sin. The style in which it is written takes you on a journey back into the past, discovering a life, which can be seen in a new light. The novel is a spyglass into the past, and shows the conditions of a different age, and supposedly a different world altogether.<BR>   At the beginning of the novel, there are four main characters. These characters consist of Malachy, Frank, Angela and Mr Mc Court (who is also named Malachy). However as life takes its toll, family members come and go, and more and more strain occurs. Each of the characters is very different (personality wise). They each have very different views on how life should be lead, which sometimes leads to a head on collision.<BR>  I think this novel is very unique and absolutely amazing. I believe that I connected with the characters and felt what they felt. At times I found the storyline a bit depressing, however this shows how well the novel has been written. I would recommend it to anyone aged 13 upwards, as it is an extrodinary tale of love poverty and sin. I was captivated by the sadness, and enlightened by the happiness, and can honestly say it was an amazing experience. I think that I would definitely read it again, and I am currently reading the sequel `tis to Angela's ashes.
B00004Z4WR|4.0|This is a fun movie to watch.  I don't really like Mr. Cage very much but he does do a good job here.  What isn't fun about watching a bunch of people steal a bunch of sweet as cars in one night?  And the chase with Cage in the last car is awesome!  The jump!  WooWEE!!!!  A fun movie to watch with some peeps or by yo self homes.<br />Way better than either fast and furios movies.
B000000W5N|5.0|I just listened to the CD over and over again driving from Las Vegas to the Grand Canyon. I've had this album ever since it came out and never tire of it. The Stones at their very best. This will be my favorite album until I die....then they can bury me with it...
B0000DBJDM|5.0|I saw Pink Floyd at Pompeii in 1979 at a midnight theater show in college. It was part of a double show, the other being Flesh Gordon. Needless to say, very few in the crowd were there to see the Floyd. However, for a minority (including myself), the film <BR>had quite an impact. I had to wait years to find the VHS version, but once I did, it was played over and over. I was always intrigued by the shots of the Pompeii ruins, artwork, bubbling mudpits, and lava flows intertwined with the soundscapes of Floyd classics, especially Set the Controls and Careful with that Ax Eugene. It provides a powerful atmosphere of isolation and despair. Unfortunately, in the DVD version, Adrien Maben has inserted some space footage (planets and spaceship) and other modern imagery (Naples) that distracts from the original mood of the theatre version. The DVD does contain some extra footage of interviews and Dark Side sessions, but the real power of the film is the concert footage. Fortunately, the DVD has an option for concert footage only. This is a must for all serious Floyd fans, and anyone who is intersted in their pre Dark Side phase. The performances of Echoes, Ax, and Set the Controls are probably the best ever recorded. Get the headphones, turn out the the lights,  put on the Concert Footage option, and enjoy.
B00005JKOV|5.0|This was a fantastic movie that just flows beautifly from one scene to the next along a smooth tango-jazz-classical soundtrack...  Each scene runs it's own course like different episodes of the same show.  It has the sort of same discontinuous flow that a dream might have, and yet it all seems to point to an underlying theme of life, death, and dreams.  Deciding where the story begins and ends is up to you, but there are so many ways to enjoy this movie, that I'd recomend it to anyone.
6305364648|1.0|This movie troubled me at the time of it's release.  I was bothered that so few reviewers, and even fewer viewers, noticed the inhumanity and cruelty of the main character.  Harry Tasker (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is authentically abusive toward his wife Helen Tasker (Jamie Lee Curtis), bludgeoning her with fear.  The film's central message seems to be that no one swarthy can be trusted.  Bear in mind that this film was made long before 9/11/01.  I am a pretty easy-going viewer and enjoy a good shoot-em-up action film as much as the next person, but this film was truly offensive to me.
B0000C0FJB|2.0|I picked RiR up on the spur of the moment. I haven't been a major fan of Rush for a few years, but a live album is always entertaining. And, usually Rush live albums aren't too bad.<br />Well, this one definitely is bad.<br />This is easily the worst mix on a live CD I've heard in several years. Vocals virtually disappear; the drums frequently sound unbelievably thin. It sounds like a midrange quality audience bootleg. <br />Which is a disappointment, because their live albums are usually pretty good best-ofs with some extra oomph and excitement. This album lacks any of the subtleties of previous live Rush recordings, and words can't express how bad the mix is.<br />If you want a recent live disc, get Different Stages instead.<br />(the CD-only tracks sound a bit better than the bulk of the CD but are pretty thin sounding.)
B00005QIPH|3.0|What can I say that hasn't been said already?  I've listened to the album a couple times already, and it isn't all that bad.  Unfortunately, there's nothing to write home about it either.  Minimalist guitar chords and basic melodies are all that come to my mind.  Their music could use some more depth.  Very reminiscent of Television and VU to say the least.  Still, it IS somewhat catchy and worth a listen.  Just don't expect too much.
0156027321|5.0|Funny, it seems that most reviewers, as well as, the author himself misunderstand this book (or could it be me, then?). This is a celebration of life in the most atheistic way: life being created by the linguistic universe we interpret it in, a social phenomenon, essentially. Here stories are our lives, religions are our stories, very much in line with Wittgenstein's second period. <br />And furthermore, this text steps over the sweat-smelling meticulous architecture of the post-modern novel, the meta-structure itself being played with throughout. The first post-post-modern book, I have read.<br />Brilliant and delight!
B0000C0FJB|5.0|What the hell are you guys talking about. I'm still waiting for the CD and the DVD to arrive at my address and I am pretty sure the entire show will rock the house and kick ass....and the sound will be amazing (you guys are no experts and have no clue what you are talking about...come on, give me a break). It's Rush performing in front of 40,000 very animated, vocal, and enthusiastic souls. That's the energy that south americans have and will never give up.<br />As someone said before, this stuff is only for die hard Rush fans, who really appreciate their work in every aspect.<br />LONG LIVE RUSH....Thank you guys for giving us this piece of treasure (specially a live DVD).
0767805712|5.0|The world of Gattaca is one where people are stratified in society by their genetic composition. Racism and classism are things of the past. Those who are bred to be genetically superior are dominant in society compared to those conceived naturally and tethered with the possibilities of a plethora of medical problems. <br />In this world, Vincent (Hawke) is a person trying to overcome his own DNA by impersonating a genetic superior. In this reality, impersonation isn't just looks... The movie takes great pains to show how appearance has become secondary in identification. <br />This movie is not the best execution. It has an excellent cast, and the supporting cast tends to run away with the film. Hawke and Thurman give somewhat cold performances, along the lines of the film itself. I think this film's strongest points are an excellent premise (one that is very relevant today with health care becoming increasingly oriented towards risk stratification)and a wealth of supporting cast talent (especially Jude Law, whose performance is stellar, and it's always nice to see Ernest Borgnine in a movie).<br />This movie is true science fiction, not aliens and space ships and the like. It's sci-fi like Bradbury is sci-fi. It's thinking sci-fi. <br />As a note, the title Gattaca is derived from the letters GTAC, which stand for the letters used to represent the nucleic acids which make up DNA (Guanine, Thymine, Adenine, and Cytosine).
B0000AXE8I|1.0|Sorry, but this movie was ANNOYING.  The fight and chase scenes were excessive and got boring after a while (the highway chase might be an exception).  Orpheus'--er, I mean Morpheus'--&quot;prophesizing&quot; was dull.  I skipped over the Zion Orgy/Keanu's Butt scene--ick.  The plot (as other reviewers have mentioned) was nonexistent.  Most of the minor characters, especially Persephone and her husband (name?), were really, REALLY annoying.<br />The only thing I liked on this entire DVD was the &quot;behind the scenes&quot; look at the highway chase.  Not worth the money.

0306812835|4.0|The book is indeed good for the layman (I would even say very good), but it lacks rigour and this makes it less usable for professional purposes...<BR>The author wants to avoid as much math as possible but as a consequence, some explanations contain gaps.<BR>This book can be seen as an extra to more professional books, everybody will definitely learn something from it and it reads very well...But if you want to have a rigorous understanding of structures, you should buy another book ...
0441172717|5.0|Dune is possibly the best science fiction novel ever written.  Most importantly, the story is engrossing; it's a page turner, a book that you stay up reading into the wee hours.  The characters are well developed, and the future worlds created are entirely believable.  I've worked in politics and the political machinations in Dune ring so very true. Many of the insights into human philosophy and psychology are extraordinary; importantly they occur in the course of the story, and don't slow the pace of the story - they're not laboured.  I first read Dune when I was about 14 and last read it when I was 36, and I read it 2 or 3 times in the intervening years. These days I find much science fiction trite and tedious, but Dune continues to entertain and intrigue me.<BR>The first 3 books in the now over-extended series are by far the best.

I have been referred to as a musical nazi before, because I only like the best stuff out there and think that everything else should be tortured and expirimented on.  I must warn you...enter into the realm of this album with no expectations. Pretend you don't even know who Maynard James Keenan is and just listen to it as though it were a beautiful painting that you can so readily get lost in.  If you want to go on a glorious journey through your own thoughts, buy this album and just listen.

B00003CX95|4.0|And I'm about as Scottish (or Celtic) as Che Guevara. This film is well written, well acted, well crafted, and truly worth every award it's received. Rent it, buy it. Just watch it and enjoy.<br />It's an oft-told tale: of a quiet hero forced by circumstances to take a stand again forces that seek to destroy what he values most. Sound familiar? It should. It's been the basis of drama for, oh about 2,500 years. And why? Because it works.<br />This film takes place during a period that, unless you're Scottish or are interested in Medieval Britain, most of us know very little about. I certainly didn't know about William Wallace and I AM a history buff... The setting doesn't get in the way of the story, and I found myself more than entertained. I found myself inspired. Not by Wallace's specific struggle, but by Gibson's treatment of the ideas behind it.<br />Now, the violence and gore may turn off some viewers, but this film packs a wallop in telling its tale. There's all the elements of the epic, including romance and betrayal and, of course, war. Gibson has been justly acclaimed for faithfully reproducing the look and feel of medieval Scotland -- blood, guts, mud and all.<br />Oh and to the \\"not historically accurate\\" nay-sayers: I don't care if it's historically inaccurate. So what? If I wanted historical accuracy I'd read a dmn non-fiction book or watch PBS. Sheesh.
B00008DDSC|5.0|This is a great little movie. It's original, funny and sexy. It's definitely for adults only, because of the S&M storyline, but it's a lot more than that. The story is refreshing and original, as well as very funny. If you liked James Spader in movies such as Sex, Lies and Videotape, you will enjoy this one. Have fun watching it.
B00005NB8K|5.0|Oliver Stone an ex Vietnam combatant, a Doors music fan, made an estrordinary work , a great vision of the sixtiees and Jim Morrisons life, great preformes, a worthy Doors movie. Not recomended meet the doors with this movie, is only the vision of a fan.
B00000G3PA|4.0|This is one of the first movies I got when I got a DVD player and got my surround sound set up.  I turned everything way up and played this movie and felt like I was in the theatre.  It's a rush.<br />The problem is when there are no asteroids hitting the earth, this movie drags.  there's no character development nor a drop of decent acting.  Then again, that's not the point of the movie.  So you may FF to get to the action sequences which are amazing, but as an audio and visual experience on DVD, this is a movie to have in your collection!
B00005JLKB|5.0|It's like the X-Files meets Superboy (while he is learning about himself and his powers) This is an awesome show! It's like a real live comic book on TV!  The DVD shines!<BR>Who in the heck directed &quot;The Hulk&quot; movie? They could take some lessons in good story telling from this show. Unbelievable! This is great entertainment! Make some popcorn, grab a Coke (with ice) and settle in for hours of entertainment. WOW!
B000092ZYX|5.0|It seems that there is many things being said about this album, what it is, what it isn't.  People are finding political themes and other meanings that  translate into what they believe the songs are about.  That is one of the many amazing abilities of this modern-day masterpiece of music.  I found \\"Hail to the Thief\\" to be original, different, and musically euphoric at the same time.  I am enthralled so much into the album that I wanted to hear what other consumers thought.  I have to say that anything negative said about this album is typical of something so brilliant that provokes negativity from those who do not appreciate something different.  This album is a breath of fresh air from a musical climate that has become stagnant. Radiohead has always pushed the envelope, sometimes questionably, but I must say regardless of what any die-hard fan or Radiohead themselves say about this album, it is a work of art.  It takes a couple listening to fully appreciate, but the songs will grow on you.  It's beautiful, melodic, hypnotic, and masterfully structured.  I'm addicted, so I may need some help soon.  My favorites on the album include - \\"Where I end and you begin\\"  \\"Go to sleep\\" \\"Punchup at a Wedding\\" \\"2+2\\" Sit down\\"  and \\"There there\\".  The whole album is wonderful though.  A music lovers dream.

0671027344|5.0|Oh man!  Charlie has forever changed how I think and feel about life, in general.  He is the most charming, sweet adolescent character you will ever meet in any book, and he becomes a part of your own personality at the end.  Once I picked this book up, I would read and read.  And to tell you the truth, I would have never read it if it weren't for my Sophomore English teacher.  But once I started, I ended the entire book in one day!  It's engaging, emotional, heartfelt, and real!  And Charlie, being as young as he is, seems older and older as the pages progress.  And by the end, not only as Charlie learned something, but the reader has as well.  BEAUTIFUL READ!
6305232660|5.0|This has most of the excitement of Armageddon but has a plot that you actually care about.  You get to go through a range of emotions other than just cool special effects.  It's more believable and more realistic which allows you to actually pay attention to the character development.  In the end, it is about the same thing as Armageddon and though it does what it does well, nobody's going to win anything for this movie.  But as entertainment value for an evening (or many - I've watched it over a dozen times and still love it), it's completely worth it!
B0000C9V3T|5.0|The high point comes early, on track 3, THE GRAND DUEL - (PARTE PRIMA) by LUIS BACALOV.  That it does not overwhelm the soundtrack is testament to the strengths of the other tracks.  It's not downhill from track 3.  It's fascinating and entertaining all the way.  Not a bad track on here!  Tarantino's best soundtrack.  Helps that the film is a knockout!!!
0767827791|3.0|OK version of the William Inge Broadway play casts thirtysomething William Holden in the twentysomething role of Hal, a drifter who blows into a sleepy Kansas town on a Labor Day Holiday weekend. How does the movie shake up the sameness of the one set play? It goes on a picnic, literally showing what the play only eluded to, with an entire town celebrating an Americana holiday weekend, with much sly eavesdropping on the American conciousness. Picture Steven Spielberg's work with New England townies in &quot;Jaws&quot;, and Director Joshua Logan accomplisshes much of the same with Mid-Westerners in a down home country state of being. I also liked the visual sky and corn stalks references of the farming industry governing, like a sleeping watchdog, over the rural community. The best thing about it though, and the best performance comes from the featured screen debut of Cliff Robertson who brings much spirit and sensitivity to the role of the lead character's best buddy.
B0000C0FJB|5.0|A fantastic performance set against the Brazilian backdrop.  The boys were definitely in fine form that night!
B00000K19E|5.0|If you haven't seen or heard of this movie by now, then you need to go rent it.  Once you've seen it, if you like it and there's one DVD you're going to own, this is it.  It's one of those movies you can keep watching.<br />This would probably always be a good choice as a gift too, if you're thinking of buying for someone else.
B00006L83N|5.0|On their latest release, Symphony X pushes heavier guitar riffs and aggressive vocals to the forefront.  &quot;Inferno&quot; begins with a fiery guitar solo that boggles the mind with its speed and accuracy.  A feat that's repeated many times throughout the album.  Allen's vocals are aggressive in their delivery, but never lose their melodic dexterity.  The vocals and guitar work are equally as punishing on &quot;Wicked&quot; and &quot;Incantations of the Apprentice.&quot;  Perhaps the most lethal track on the disc is &quot;King of Terrors&quot;, which is based on the Edgar Allen Poe classic &quot;The Pit and the Pendulum.&quot;  For those who think that the group has abandoned their progressive roots for a heavier sound, fear not.  &quot;Accolade II&quot; showcases the epic production and vivid expression that Symphony X are known for.<br />Of course it's the centerpiece of the album that steals the show. &quot;The Odyssey&quot; is a brilliant, twenty-four minute, progressive metal masterpiece that takes the listener on a musical journey through Symphony X's interpretation of Homer's epic poem (high school literature).  The track is broken into seven chapters that tell the tale of Odysseus' harrowing post-Trojan journey back home.  The story is played out in both lyrical and instrumental forms.  Influenced by classical movie scores, &quot;Odysseus' Theme / Overture&quot; begins our story.  The group relates to the original Greek tale with chapters about the Cyclopse (&quot;The Eye&quot;), temptations of the Sirens' song (&quot;Sirens), Odysseus' conquest of Circe (&quot;Circe - Daughter of the Sun&quot;), a dangerous ocean journey (&quot;Scylla and Charybdis&quot;), and finally our hero's return home with violent results (&quot;The Fate of the Suitors / Champion of Ithica&quot;).<br />Bottom Line:<br />One of the best metal albums of the year!  The combination of sharp melodic vocals, heavy guitar tones, over the top arrangements, and epic story telling make The Odyssey a cut above the rest.  Symphony X are carrying the torch of old school metal as they display a flair for furious guitar shredding and conceptual story telling.  Don't think that means their music is outdated.  With the added progressive elements, the group makes classic metal sound fresh.  It can be a little confusing figuring where the next chapter begins on &quot;The Odyssey&quot;, but I won't hold it against them.The Odyssey a cut above the rest.

B00006L7XQ|5.0|I am the least capable person to review this album. This man had been writing and singing songs for forty years and all I'd heard of him was &quot;Ring Of Fire&quot;. I knew the song. I did not know who sang it. It was all but another one of these inevitable songs on every compilation, and one of these songs every channel my parents loved so much would play. I never noticed. Today, I still know hardly more.<br />One late-summer evening as I was zapping through the music channels here in The Netherlands, my thumb froze over the remote. On the screen singing was, not the usual parade of lewd, crafted, playbacking little mouths seemingly right of production lines, not good capable singers only better than the rest because of management and advertisement skills; it was a man dressed in black, looking old as death, with a voice raw as a crow's. I did not know it was he, if it had mattered. It was Cash, singing &quot;Hurt&quot;. I looked, listened but then more. It was so unspeakably sad, so unfathomably melancholic. How can I describe the emotions hearing that song? Haunted and moved don't seem adequate.<br />Enchantment. I was a youth with a passion for music: metal, symphonic, classic, techno. Give it to me, give it to me every day, all day long. I'll be satisfied. I was a youth, looking at an old man, singing for me, singing of his life and emotions. Music moves me always, but it was this music, barely more than a voice and an acoustic guitar, that drew a tear, dropped into my heart - then another and another. Silent, invisible tears filling hollows, and all that showed on the outside, were a sniff of the nose and a blink of the eyes. I was a youth.<br />Many of the songs on this final album, including &quot;Hurt&quot;, are covers, even though some are his own. Cash here also covers Paul Simon, Hank Williams and John Lennon. Not all of his arrangements are better than the originals. Technically. But Cash performs with such feeling, such sway, such voice, that this is the most cherished music I've bought in a lifetime.<br />Then, as I sat there oblivious, and wishing I had seen the whole thing, the clip ended and I saw Cash's name. I turned off the set, stood, and hoped I would hear it again. Weeks later, Cash was dead. Today, I still know hardly more.<br />Five stars to this album<br />Bram Janssen,<br />The Netherlandsthe most cherished music I've bought in a lifetime.<br />Then, as I sat there oblivious, and wishing I had seen the whole thing, the clip ended and I saw Cash's name.

0618164413|4.0|This makes a great gift. Curious George is a very fun character, who gets into really interesting situations. There's a lot of \\"story\\" here, and hours of reading fun.<br />I like this one as it's become a cherished book for my kids. They read it together, and have lots of fun with it.
B0000C0FJB|4.0|i`m fan for the band for the last 20 years, i think the cd is great , in the beginning of the cd , i cant heart the voice in the first songs and is very crowdly,but while play the cd like in the 5 and 6 songs is fixed(more clearly),add to this if you want more quality you can equalize the sounds to hear more clearly, i saw and hear the dvd and the quality sound is much better and tell you is very more clearly.<BR>if you compare the last songs vital signs and between sun.... the sounds is very clearly, i think Rush had intention of the touching feel of the best group of the world and is not neccesary<BR>to show(we know it) in turn of this i think better idea to show with geat quality of the sound.for me the salvation of the cd is the last songs vital signs and between sun....
0060987464|5.0|This is not an autobiography.  It can certainly pass for an autobiography, but the real purpose of the book is an outlet for Marilyn Manson to state what events came together to lead him where he is today: the world's leading figure against Christianity. This is where the book leaves off. Since then, Marilyn Manson has become more than the definitive anti-Christ, and evolved to be at his very core an artist who stands against Everything. And he does it with a grace, originality, and subtlety that is so hard to find in many other artists today.<br />Many who read this book wonder what happened to him. Where did he go wrong? The people who ask this are unfortunately the ones who he is trying to reach the most. A better question is not what went wrong in his life to lead him where he is today. The question is what happened to everyone else, and why is Marilyn Manson the only one?
B000002JPA|5.0|I bought this album almost ten years ago, I think, and it's still the best album I've ever heard.  I love pretty much every album Dream Theater has made, because they all have their own unique sound, but there's just something about this one I love above the rest. So many great riffs, melodies, instrumental passages.  From the heavy-hitting prog epic &quot;Metropolis Part 1&quot;, to the impossibly uplifting &quot;Surrounded&quot;, to what is probably my all-time favorite song, &quot;Learning to Live&quot;, there is no moment of this album that doesn't blow me away.  Prog really achieved perfection with this disc, in a way that no other band before or after has done (although Pain of Salvation did come pretty close with &quot;Remedy Lane&quot;).  These guys just make stellar music.  I eagerly await the new album.  I know it's gonna be a great one.
6303257844|4.0|I saw bits and pieces of this movie a few years ago, and didn't think much of it. Last night I watched it all the way through for the first time. What a ride!<br />I love the chemistry between Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves. Both their characters were so heroic and caring - what a great example! <br />The movie was just plain on-the-edge-of-your-seat action. It was fast, it was exciting, it was fun.<br />There wasn't a lot of cussing, but there were several bloody scenes. It wasn't nearly as gory as most similar kinds of movies are, however, which I appreciated.<br />This isn't going to change your life, but it's certainly a fun few hours.
B00008RH3L|4.0|Miller's Crossing is one of those films that is like a fine wine, gets better as time passes.  The performances are great, yet this isn't your typical Cohen brother film.  I'd say this is their most serious effort to date.  Worth a look for fans of ganster films, but you may want to think before purchasing cause there isn't much here in terms of extras.  However, the film is something to savor.
B000050FEN|5.0|when you see a realistic movie you know it's good. i liked this movie to every extent. it's a likeable movie.
B00005JKZU|3.0|There are already myriad reviews of this film, but I'll add my $.02 - if we're just talking about the merits of the film, it was pretty good but can in no way compare to the detail and depth of the original Tolkein works. It was darker in many places than the first film, if that's possible. But if you've not read the books it gives you a decent overview of the events the contained in the book. I'd recommend getting the books and the movies and do your own comparison.
0783225857|5.0|One of my favorite movies ever. I can watch this over and over again.
B000089RVR|5.0|Life for rent was beyond my expectance, it delivered a mix of with a nice beat, songs with breath taking lyrics, other songs with a beutiful sting arrangement etc..  The best songs I think are White Flag, Life For Rent See You When You're 40, Who Makes You Feel, Do you Have A Little Time and See The Sun.  I could easily name all of the songs but I stick with my favourites.  If you have blood running through your veins you will love this CD.  Believe me it's well worth it!
B00005JLYW|5.0|i loved this movie. it's so much better than the original. the only reason i liked the original is because cameron diaz was in it. there are many reasons to like this sequel. more fun , allot more action , and it's funnier.
0385504209|5.0|I could not put this book down.  The mysteries just kept building up and up to the exciting climax.  Dan Brown kept my attention from start to finish.  His grasp of symbology and cryptology tied everything together in a neat package.  The characters were believable.  My husband was so enthused about &quot;The Da Vanci Code&quot; that he read this book in record time.  He especially enjoyed the way Mr. Brown incorporated technical features throughout the book.
B00005UEAR|5.0|having been a rush fan for over quarter of a century (yikes!) I never expected to say this, but disk 2 of 6DOIT has knocked 2112 off my top spot of greatest album ever. This is a true masterpiece. Buy it and you will be hooked.<br />Steve
B000083E79|5.0|I recently attended the farewell tour by cher and i wasnt a cher fan then but i am now. She blew me away at the concert and i loved her. I recently bought 5 of her cds including this one and i fell in love with her music. It has meaning and it tells a story. It has helped me get through my hard times the past year. I love cher and would give up my life for her. I recommend everone buy this cd and if you dont, your the one losing out.
B000002LR6|5.0|Ministry's most commercially popular album &quot;Psalm 69&quot; is a classic Industrial Thrash record and this is one of the strangest yet coolest(not cool as in the trend) albums i own. Most people know about this album seeming it features there hit single &quot;Jesus Built My Hotrod&quot; however i can asure you that this album offers much much more than just that song. There is nothing negative at all about this album, even the 8 minute song &quot;Scarecrow&quot; is good and even the last two tracks of the album &quot;Corrosion&quot; and &quot;Grace&quot; are good which are sinister instrumentals. Singer Al has one hell of a harsh voice and his screams will make your ears bleed. The guitarist plays some very crunchy guitar riffs and in songs like &quot;Just One Fix&quot; you may be reminded of Rammstein by the sound of the guitar riffs, and the drummer is intense enough to please a Slayer fan, and The sampling work on this album is great.<br />Some of the standout tracks on this album include &quot;N.O.W.&quot; which starts off with an intense drum roll and then samples start coming in as well as guitars, and near the end a sample of George Bush declaring war. &quot;Just One Fix&quot; is the catchiest song on this album with some of the best guitar riffs that this album has to offer. The guitar riffs remind me of Rammstein song &quot;Zwitter&quot;. I love the scream at the begiining of the song. &quot;Jesus Built My Hotrod&quot; is their hit single. This song is one of their most fast paced songs on this album and one of their least dark songs on this album. This song is one of the coolest car songs ever. &quot;Psalm 69&quot; is my favourite song on the album. The song starts off with a priest telling the people to open their prayer books to psalm 69, and after that you hear a haunting sample, and then you hear a sample of a kid praying. This song is also the funniest song on the album with some very odd humor. This song is mainly mocking christianity.<br />Thisis such a great album if you call yourself an Indutrial fan and you don't own this, get this album now, you will like it. All in all no filler track, all tracks are great, terrific sampling work, high replay value, great vocals, great odd humor in some songs, no negatives.
B00004R99R|2.0|Alright, I know, I know, this is a children's movie but still. First of all, Hera and Zeus were NOT happily married; she only married him because he raped her. Secondly, Hera was not Hercules' mom nor did she love him, she tried to kill him on numerous occasions. Hercules was one of the offspring of one of Zeus' many &quot;consorts&quot;. Another thing, this is supposed to be Greek mythology, in Greek mythology Hercules was called Heracles and only become Hercules in Roman mythology. Also, there were nine muses not five. Narcissus would be dead and not up on Mount Olympus staring into a mirror; as soon as he discovered himself with his reflection in a lake, he stayed there and slowly died. Gah! I like this movie but it annoys me too much with all the mess ups in it.
B0000CD5FN|4.0|Joe's passing was one of the hardest days of my life.  I've never met someone as truly dedicated to his art as Joe.  So, when it was announced that there would be one last cd released by Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros, I was unbelievable happy.  Sitting on pins and needles, I finally heard the cd.  I was truly amazed.  After Joe's last brilliant cd, &quot;Global A Go-Go&quot;, I wasn't sure what to expect. The world music isn't as prevalent on this new cd, &quot;Streetcore&quot;.  However, the cd still delves into a variety of music:  rock, folk, blues, hip hop, reggae...it's all here in true Strummer style.  Joe was lucky to have had Mick Jones as his songwriting partner during the days of the Clash.  He was blessed twice, because Martin Slatery and Scott Shields were the perfect complements for Strummer's writing.  <br />&quot;Coma Girl&quot; is as good a song as Strummer has ever released.  Great melody and a good rockin' song.  I would have loved to have seen him play this song live.  &quot;Get Down Moses&quot; is another fun song with elements of reggae and hip hop.  &quot;Long Shadow&quot; was a song written for Johnny Cash.  A very poignant song.  It was written about Cash's legecy, but fits Strummer's just as well.  It was recorded with Beck's guitarist, Smokey Hormel.  Joe's version of &quot;Redemption Song&quot; is amazing.  His vocals are truly awesome.  I would never say anyone could sing it better than Bob Marley, but Joe does a damn good job.  &quot;Midnight Jam&quot; is a really cool song that's mostly an instrumental.  Joe passed on before he was able to add lyrics to the song, but it was too great of a song not to add, so Slattery and Shields added it to the cd.  &quot;All In A Day&quot; is a great rocking song.  When I read the liner notes, I was half expecting to see it listed as a Jones/Strummer song.  It definitely sounds like something that Big Audio Dymanite would have put out back in the days when they were good.  <br />One note about the cdpackaging.  It's done in such a way that I was reminded of the packaging of the Clash's &quot;Sandinista&quot;.  Lots of little quotes and, as one other reviewer said, &quot;half thoughts&quot;, that are very much something that Joe Strummer was known for.  His wife, Lucinda, even has a little &quot;Thank You&quot; section in the liner notes which is really sad.  <br />This last cd by Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros is, in my opinion, the best one of the three on Hellcat Records.  It takes the best elements of the first two cd's and melds them together.  If we're lucky, Hellcat will be able to release a live cd by Joe and the Meskies.  If not, I think this is a great place to end an amazing career.  Godspeed, Joe.  And, thanks for the memories!
B0000CD5FN|4.0|I haven't heard a rock album this solid in a long time. Easily the best album of '03 and Joe's best work since the Clash. Highly recommended. 4 1/2 stars.
0966638328|5.0|I read Eiseman's color guide literally cover to cover. I am not only  impressed with the way she writes about color, from the perspective of color psychology, but that she is able to effectively organize an extensive series of exquisite palettes according to so many different &quot;feeling states.&quot;<br />I teach color theory in my two-day Dynamic Graphics Training course and had always recommended another book that has a similar<BR>approach--Designer's Guide to Color 5 by Ikuyoshi Shibukawa and Yumi Takahashi [Chronicle Books, San Fran]--but Eiseman's palettes are better, color-wise. And they use a more sophisticated presentation by having both a dominant color and surrounding secondary colors, as well as offering a more extensive library of palettes. And they not only give CMYK values like the Color 5 book, but also the PMS spot color and the hexachrome color values. And of course the beautiful layout and typography of the book add quite a lot to the book's seduction. It's utterly enticing! Well worth the investment.
B0000B3FCX|1.0|If I had two nickels to rub together, I'd probably use them to buy something. I dunno what, maybe a piece of bubblegum or something. What else can you buy with two nickels? Time was when you could buy a cup of coffee with that kind of money. But that was before my time. It is for these reasons alone that I can't give a rave review to this album, even if I wanted to, which I don't, but wouldn't nonetheless, unless my life depended on it, for instance, if the record producer was holding a gun to my head and I truly believed he was going to pull the trigger if I didn't give a rave review, my sense of self-preservation would supersede my fine critical acumen and against all the musical instincts I possess I would then have to give it a rave review under duress and therefore it would not be legally enforceable as an accurate testimony regarding what I would consider its true worth. Does anyone have a licorice whip I can chew on?
B0000C9V3T|3.0|This soundtrack has a few good songs on it, I got it just for the whistle one (so I can learn the whistle) and &quot;Woo Hoo&quot;, the one the japanses chicks sing in the club. Some of the older songs that are on the Cd are good (I love the Issac hayes one), but a few just plain suck (especially the one with RZA talking over it). Good to buy if you really like some of the songs from the moive, but dont be looking for anything more than that.
B0000A1RJI|4.0|Just take a look at the background.Hans Zimmer is shown as overproducer and, whatever it means, there's no doubt he was the first composer assigned for the job of scoring &quot;Pirates&quot;. And it shows, because from beginning to end, this OST sounds like Zimmers touch. It reminds you of &quot;The Rock&quot; and &quot;The Peacemaker&quot; in a way that it's unhealthy for Klaus Badelt.<BR>Undoubtedly, this score is Badelt trying to play with a theme created by Zimmer, his mentor.<BR>Nevermind, if you're in to the sound of Hans Zimmer's. This OST is strong, heartfelt and, at times, even majestic. It is a pleasure for your ears. As long as you don't keep tracing it back to those other soundtracks I mentioned.
B00005NTJK|4.0|Thirty years later, this is still a great album. On my second listen through I decided to do an A/B comparison to the Canadian release on Vinyl because somthing sounded wrong on my first listen. <br />It was, of course, only the order of songs. &quot;Alive and.. &quot; was not on the vinyl, but &quot;Inside&quot; took its place. And on the second side, &quot;Teacher&quot; took the place of &quot;Inside&quot;. Like many children of the sixties, I am just as sensistive to the continuity of the album as to the individual songs themselves. This mix really throws me for a loop,hence the 4 stars instead of five. I just hope I can get used to the new order because the mastering is very clean, none of the pops and clicks that the vinyl has accumulated over the years. <br />Overall, this is still a great album.
B000068TSI|5.0|We Were Soldiers was the greatest war movie I have ever seen. It beats Platoon, Gettysburg, Full Metal Jacket, and Hamburger Hill. I think this was the best performance Mel Gibson has made since the Lethal Weapon Series. This movie has action and it also has a few funny parts in it too. This movie has got me so hooked that I am even reading the book. A must see movie!!!

Details abound in the authors description of the different types of zombie outbreaks, the distingushing characteristics of the undead, and how to protect yourself from a fate worse then death...coming back hungry for FLESH. In all seriousness though, it is the serious portrail of this survival guide that make it humoress. I enjoy the fact that the author decided to write it as though it were a survival guide rather then a humoress narative or something along those lines. If you don't understand that humor, don't buy it. If you don't, buy it, enjoy it, and follow its instructions to the letter...OR ELSE!!!

IT WASNT SCAREY AT ALL!!! the blood was so fake ,who has red orange blood?! i mean come on!! the acting was bad, the characters didnt seem scared enough. i'd compare this movie to a corny hunted house at a pumpkin patch or something.after watching the movie you'll feel confused and mad .nothing scary happend though out the movie. dont buy it!!!

B000005JA8|5.0|As is evident from many of the reviews on this site, TMR is not for everyone.  It certainly requires repeated listens and an open mind.  You've likely never experienced anything quite like it before, although you will have caught brief glimpses in the music of Pere Ubu, the Fall, John Lydon's PIL, Talking Heads, Flipper, Meat Puppets, the Ex, and Sonic Youth.  TMR is a dense yet exhilirating and groundbreaking brew of Mississippi Delta blues, free jazz, '60s garage rock, and dadaist word-play.  For those who enjoy avante-garde music, I highly recommend TMR.  The Cap'n is a genius, and the fact that most mainstream fans simply don't get him does absolutely nothing to dissuade me of that belief (in fact, just the opposite).
0385504209|5.0|The thing that really got me after I completed the book (in under 2 days!) was that most of the novel expands 7 hours.  With a lot of flashbacks, character points of view and history to keep you going, this book is one of the most fast paced books I have ever read.<br />The story behind the mystery is very enticing.  I noticed some of the other reviewers mentioned sitting by a computer while they read the story - I too did this and interrupted my reading quite frequently to look up details.<br />At the very least, keep a thorough art book - Renaissance in particular - handy while you read this novel.<br />Definite top 5 books I have ever read.
B00005UEAR|4.0|I really don't like to do this sort of &quot;song by song&quot; analysis of albums, but this one deserves it:<br />The Glass Prison: Great song, starts with double bass drumming and great guitar solo. Heavy crunchy riffs on this one, the seven stringed guitar sounds really heavy, close to the &quot;Awake&quot; sound. Great guitar and keys solos, nice lyrics, outstanding Bass as well. 5/5<br />Blind Faith: Another good one, but there's something missing. 4/5<br />Misunderstood: Just average lyrics and song structure. 3/5<br />The Great Debate: I Hate, i really, really hate the lyrics of this song. The riff is ok, but just that. I think that DT shouldn't be doing these sort of Tool stuff. Tool's great, but that's because they are TOOL. The lyrics of The Great Debate tend to be &quot;deep&quot; but are awfull and that spoils the whole song.<BR>Yeah, the riffs are OK, pure Tool, nice time shifts and all. 2/5<br />Disappear: Skip this one. 1/5<br />Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence: A good story. Good riffs, nice intro. 4/5
B0000BYM3K|4.0|It's that time again when we, the true Maiden fans, get out our t-shirts, our Eddie and Iron Maiden flags and start to wave them like we alsways do, full of pride that our favourite band has pulled another trick out of the hat and created an album that does both us and the band proud.<BR>Even though I'm only 16 and have only been a fan of Maiden for 2 years now, I've heard literally all Maiden songs, own most albums, the computer game, the t-shirts, and I've even been to a concert where I was in the front row. To me, Maiden is what makes a band great and makes music worth listening to.<BR>This album is no exception to what makes Maiden great. Even though they're getting on a bit now, they can still show these young kids in metal a thing or two about how to play metal and give the fans what they want and still leave them wanting more.<BR>It's no &quot;Number Of The Beast&quot; where you can't fault anything, yet it's no &quot;X-Factor&quot; where it sounds depressing throughout everything. Its does have some flaws, but these are miniscule mistakes. The first track, Wildest Dreams, has that unmistakeable fast beat tempo, courtesy of Nicko and the boys on guitars, and sounds like the sort of music we come to expect of the band. The songs Rainmaker, Montsegur and New Frontier are also exceptional songs which make you feel alive and want to raise your hands in the air and scream. The only song which I still don't like is Paschendale because of its hard opening which sounds like something that Metallica would do (no offence to any of their fans out there). The other songs, Gates Of Tomorrow, Journeyman, Face In The Sand, Age Of Innocence, No More Lies, and the title track Dance Of Death, are all great songs but not my favourites.
B000002H97|4.0|This album is actually the one. The one that started the &quot;new&quot; Metallica. Though it isn't a bad album at all, it is clearly for the masses. Slower songs, the lyrics changed a little from their previous works, no complexity at all.<br />And...Justice For All was so complex and brutal that this one seems to be even softer than it actually is. <br />Metallica performs great songs: Enter Sandman, Wherever I May Roam, Through The Never, Sad But True.<br />Absolutely recommendable for everyone who wants to take a look into metal music or wnats to give metal a chance.
B0000399WI|5.0|This movie is without a doubt one of the best you will EVER see.  The lead character, Andy Dusfrene (played brilliantly by Tim Robbins) is falsely accused of the double murder of his wife and her lover, and he arrives at Shawshank Prison where corruption, murder, bribery, and sadism take place daily.  He befriends Ellis &quot;Red&quot; Redding (also brilliantly played by Morgan Freeman) and the two begin a long and poignant friendship.<br />Both go through the trials and tribulations of prison life as Andy tries in his own unique way to bring some normalcy and even beauty into their surroundings.  But Andy has a secret that we don't discover until well into the film; A secret destined to change the lives of both he and his friend. This secret leads to many twists and turns and finally to the shocking and inspiring ending of the movie.<br />Of particular note, is the superb performance of Bob Gunton who plays prison warden Samuel Norton. Why he didn't get the Academy Award for his role is beyond me!  He does some of the best acting in a supporting role that has EVER been done by ANY actor. <br />This film showcases the indomitability of man's spirit as well as the farther reaches of his courage.  This is a must see and one you will want to see again and again.
B000000OSE|4.0|UYI I is probably the best work ever done by Guns N Roses. Their Hard-Rock was unique. And they even wrote some ballads and stuff like that. Some of the songs on this one are classics.<br />Nice rock for everybody who could stand Axel Rose's vocals.
B0000CABJ1|5.0|Ok, I admit it, I didnt buy this because I dont have a greatest hits package from Donna! I have many....!<BR>But here you get the hits in new and wonderful remastered sound and they sound really good and fresh! Here youll find all the hits that catapulted Donna to stardom all over the world.<BR>From \\"Love to love you baby\\" up until the great \\"I will go with you (Con te partiro)\\" from a few years ago. There are 3 new tracks that really make this worth buying. The first 2 are on disc one. \\"Thats the way it is\\" - a really catchy straight up popsong with sort of a reggae feel. The second one is \\"I will follow love\\" and it really lives up to Donnas standard of melodramatic showtunes with a hard discobeat! I love them! <BR>But the real standout track is found on disc two (the bonus disc). This track is the underground dance track that leaked out all over the internet in the beginning of this year and was picked up by DJs all over the place! Its called \\"Youre so beautiful\\". This has Donna singing over a throbbing bassline and it builds up to anthemic proportions! I mean, who can sing \\"hey hey hey, mmmmmm,oooohh\\" (or something like it!), and make it sound as sexy as Donna?<BR>Im only asking.<BR>BUY IT!
B000001FOS|4.0|Oh..this one's so - so - so &quot;80's&quot;. The vocals, and all..so, so 80's.
B0000AQS6R|2.0|(Instead of reviewing a film you probably already know, I stick to DVD special features)<br />Those Extras:<br />Commentary:  Atrocious.  Not only is Chase not there, D' Angelo doesn't shut up about her hair and breasts, Quaid has a handful of words to say, and Flynn---a sub, sub, sub-character---does all the talking like a bragging journeywoman actress.<br />Overall:  THAT'S IT????  No making of, no deleted scenes, bloopers (which are ESSENTIAL to a comedy DVD), no new interviews.  This is the second DVD treatment of this film, what do we have to do, wait till the fifth time around for Warner to get it right!
B000021XS0|5.0|After Falling Into Infinity, Dream Theater faced the fact that they needed the typical process lived by many bands...&quot;returning to their roots&quot;. And lucky us because DT did a tremendous comeback with this one. Recruiting Jordan Ruddess was a major upgrade for the band. <br />The only thing that i'll never be pleased with is the whole concept of this album. I mean, i loved the &quot;abstract&quot; lyrics of Metropolis pt 1, and turning the whole story into a murderer and how the spirit (or whatever) manages to tell her truth it's just plain..mm...human...mmm.., i don't know how to explain it.<br />Well, now the positive things, which are the most. Metropolis Part 2 : Scenes From A Memory is a trully, trully masterpiece. This album is art people. Great riffs, melodies, solos, and everything.DT moves between nice soft-emotional songs and fast metal riffs. The songs are so-well constructed...it's amazing really, there's no words to describe it. Go Buy It...<br />Outstanding drumming. John Petrucci's solos are incredible!, Ruddess is a monster on keyboards, check out his solo in Beyond This Life, amazing!.<br />There's some Tool influence on Home's main riff, but that's OK with me.
B00001MXXH|3.0|(Instead of reviewing a film you probably already know, I stick to DVD special features)<br />Those Extras:<br />Commentary:  HUMONGOUS treat.  That John Hughes took the time out to go scene by scene for us was too cool.  You won't go away still curious about how the film was made.<br />Overall:  Even with the commentary being it, the chance to hear Voice of the 80s Generation Hughes record a track bumps this up to a three.  This wasn't dubbed a Special or Collector's Edition, so you gotta feel a more jacked-up offering will be along soon.  New interviews, deleted scenes, a BTS and even the trailer(!) will be awesome.
0385504209|1.0|Great opening chapter, and downhill from there. I was suspicious when so many articles and websites and reviews commented that \\"they never knew such and such\\" or that their \\"eyes were opened\\" about church- and art-history. Was this written-for-screenplay-use book being taken seriously?  Apparently so.<br />Beyond the wooden characters, and predictable plot - the guy was seemingly trying to teach or inform the readers about \\"great mysteries.\\" My frustration hit its peak in the first few chapters. He has his art-scholar quoting experts talking about \\"Wicca\\" as an \\"ancient religion.\\" Anyone with three minutes on the internet can discover that Wicca was made up whole-cloth in the past 50 years from the writings of A. Crowley.  The positive reviews seem to have a common thread: they are gleeful. They are enjoying what they perceive as \\"those Catholics/Christian getting theirs, hee-heehumor.  Likewise, liking a book because it proves a point is not the same as the enjoyment of a good beach-book.<br />Thumbs down. For those who were concerned or \\"never knew...\\" some of the \\"facts\\" presented - a little research will do the trick. This pulp-fiction bodice-ripper of a detective story has not undone 2000 years of history and understanding.  This conclusion can be made on a critique of the \\"sources\\" cited in the book - without recourse to point/counterpoint on his conclusions.<br />For an article on that, see Crisis Magazine: [...]
B00005U8EM|3.0|(Instead of reviewing a film you probably already know, I stick to DVD special features)<br />Those Extras:<br />Commentary:  Great job from Ramis, who covers all technical, location and casting aspects of this favorite.  Pretty much no stone unturned.  Ramis is really coming off as one of the better directors to handle DVD running commentaries.<br />New Interviews:  Only half good.  I'm getting really sick of the star of the movie not showing up to talk about it.  Instead we get McDowell and Tobolowsky---who comes off a little too into the movie---along with Ramis and writer Rubin.  The HBO original BTS would've really bouyed this.  Glad I taped it back then :).<br />Overall:  Sorry to say that's it.  Lacking the ususal fun stuff of a Collector's Edition leaves a fan disappointed.  Ramis nearly saves that with his fine effort on the audio track.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I originally bought Come Away with Me by Norah Jones for myself, and my husband almost immediately kidnapped the CD for use in his car when he travels, and especially if he is stuck in traffic.  The peaceful, soothing and lovely tones of Norah Jones are so wonderful.  Now I'll have to buy another one just for myself!<br />This music CD is definitely a must have, for anyone who wants an alternative to the hip hop, rap or other types of music that are often playing on the radio.  Turn off the radio, put in this Norah Jone's CD and relax!
B00004S6GL|5.0|After just learning the news of Elliott Smith's passing yesterday, I felt compelled to share the fact that his songwriting is on a higher caliber than most others, and it is unfortunate that his talent will probably remain a silent wonder to those of use who have had the pleasure of being introduced to his songwriting craft. This album is simply excellent. It can play over and over without getting old. It is a significant stride from the straightforward acoustic tracks that you may have heard from past records. Each record has its own unique aspects that make them worthwhile.<br />Figure 8 is an excellent compliment to the other Elliot Smith song collections. If you are even a remote fan of his style, yet enjoy a bit more production than most of his acoustic songs, this is the record for you. The melodies remain strong. The balance between some electric guitars, drums, and hooks are a welcome addition to this talented songwriter's acoustic folk-like melodic, slightly pop-rock influenced style.<br />Elliott Smith, thank you for your music while you were with us. Rest in peace. - Dave B., Chicago.
B000006MV8|5.0|I remember buying this from the local convinience store. Back then they were called albums, The 2 hits Baby Blue and Day after Day were my reasons for making this purchase. The album as a whole, to me has a very cohesive sound throughout. The original order of songs made it a very even CD, it has a very big sound, and the production is outstanding. It continues to be one of my all time favorites. Pete Ham, was a great song writer. Much more credit needs to be given to this bands legacy.
0671027387|5.0|I have read all four of Dan Brown's novels and rate them all at 5 stars.<br />Deception Point is the only novel of Brown's that has made a mistake<br />by assigning goodness and evil to  2 main characters by making one a<br />Republican and one a Democrat. The Democrat is a good guy<br />supporting a tax-funded black hole agency as something desirable.<br />The bad guys are evil free market villians which the public needs to be protected from. It's a shame that a person (Brown) that has explored so much of history and has made clear cut conclusions in order to weave his stories with so much authenticity, has to this point been unable to shed his political brainwashing received in schools of higher learning.<br />Deception Point did not have to identify political parties to make it the exciting novel that it is.
B0000C0FJB|1.0|True to their history of producing sub par live albums this one sets a new low.  It's too bad a bad this great band can't find the technology and or crew to make a decent recording.  I guess after 30 years you can't fire your crew because their your friends and you can't bring yourself around to telling them they can't make a decent live recording.<br />From the first track the poor quality is painfully obvious as you strain to discern Geddy's voice from the crowd noise.  It sounds like he's in the front row and the crew miked him from about 5 feet away.  <br />Overall the bass is about twice the volume it should be and Geddy's voice about half the volume of what it should be.  In the included booklet Geddy mentions the fact that the CD is an afterthought to the DVD that they were recording.  Geddy really has no excuse since he is listed as a co mixer in the credits.  <br />Most of the album sounds muddy and almost mono.  There is little channel seperation. In 2003 you expect much better recording quality. <br />It really is a shame because the performances are first rate.  <br />MAYBE the sound will be better on the DVD, after all they were actually trying to record for DVD, but I would tend to doubt it because this CD sounds terrible.  And that's a shame because I've been a fan for over 25 years, and I'm still waiting for a decent live album.<br />Go checkout the DVD reviews to see if they managed any better recording there.  At least you'll get to see the light show.  My only saving grace was that I only wasted $15.99 at Circuit City for this poor quality recording.
0440180295|5.0|This is an amazingly entertaining book. Before reading Slaughter House Five, I had never laughed out look while reading a book. No longer. This is brilliant book is extremely clever. It is original in almost every sense. I normally read non-fiction and was not entirely excited about reading this. But this book surprised me in spectacular ways. Vonnegut is outrageous. He is witty and he holds no punches. If you like fiction, you likely will like this book. <br />If you are skeptical and think that fiction is a waste of your time, give this book a try. It will open your mind and make you wish that you were as creative as Kurt Vonnegut. This book reads very quickly and should be enjoyable to everyone who appreciates satire and surprise.
076790592X|4.0|This book is about a unique man who finds out he has a limited amount of time to live.  He has a former student, Mitch, who hadn't been in contact with him for many years.  This story is about a man's journey to death and the relationship that forms between Morrie and Mitch.  This book was a moderate to easy read, but I really enjoyed it; it had a lot of good ideas and morals behind it.<BR> Mitch was fortunate enough to find out about Morrie's situation, and they began to start meeting together again.  Morrie used this to tell Mitch those things that he needed to get out and that Mitch needed to hear.  Morrie is not afraid of the death that he is about to encounter; he chooses to learn from it.  One of his quotes is \\"Once you learn to die, you learn to live.\\"  He really chose to live according to this, and he incorporated Mitch in along the way. <BR> I would recommend that everyone read this book at least once in his or her life.  It's not the most in depth, mind-boggling story, but sometimes it is important to hear those small but very important things every now and then also.
B00003CWTI|5.0|\\"Magnolia\\" is what Robert Altman's \\"Short Cuts\\" wanted to be. Where Altman's film was disjointed and distant, though, \\"Magnolia\\" is coherent and emotionally resonant throughout.<br />I find myself thinking about the film often, and then thinking about it again, hunting for the soundtrack with the amazing Aimee Mann songs (\\"Save Me\\" and \\"Wise Up\\" are particularly good), and connecting elements of the film as I listen to the music, considering what it means to me, what it might mean to people I know.<br />Watching the \\"Magnolia Diary\\" on the DVD reminded me of my own experience in directing and producing a drama in college, with all its humor and difficulty and chaos. To go from that chaos, though, and create such a powerful film from it... it's nothing short of incredible. Despite being more than 3 hours long, \\"Magnolia\\" is well worth seeing more than once.
B000000W5N|1.0|Overrated album. Please The Stones can't play music at all.<BR>Look at the art cover of this CD. What are they? GAYS?? I think so. At least put the picture of a girl wearing jeans. <br />Don't buy this. There's so many great albums to be heard. Don't waste your time on the Rolling Stones. It's just a tourism journey in rock history. That's it.<br />Charlie Watts, someone give him a little of blood.<BR>Bill Wyman, bye bye.<BR>Keith Richard, try to kill yourself with drugs.<BR>Mick Jagger, fill your mouth with gum and shut up.<BR>Brian Jones, the only musician in there, died.
B00005JKZV|4.0|This movie, in a word, was 'entertaining'. I wouldn't go so far as to give it a 5-Star rating, because of its mistake of leaving out several key events in the books. But, putting that aside, the portrayals were nearly flawless, and the emotions seemed to actually jump from the movie into our hearts. I would very much hope that viewers were touched by Smeagol's plight, and Frodo's gradual losses of control. Smeagol was portrayed perfectly. His expressions look so human, that it's a wonder that he was computer generated. Frodo's 'posessed face', though not a great achievement in acting, was very amusing. The bettle for Helms Deep was also very strong. The hopelessness, the bravery, all were wonderful, and had us actually rooting for a victory for good. In Smeagol's case, we were disappointed, and even saddened by his pain and confusion.<BR>This movie recieves a 4-Star rating. (4 3/4 would have been better.)
B00006AW2G|1.0|The Rolling Stones sucks. Always did and always will.<BR>Charlie Watts can't play, please. Let's be honest. He can't play drums. He's already dead sitting there. Keith Richard can't play lead guitar either. Mick Jagger just be quiet. Bill Wyman, go to sleep and Brian Jones, well he's ok. And unfortunally the only one worth it in that bad died young.<br />Don't get any Cds by this awful band. The Who are wayyyyyyy much better, not to mention the Beatles and The Kinks.
0761536434|3.0|This is really two books in one. The first half is a detailed history of the rise and fall of Atari. It is chock full of interesting details, and rightly focuses on the fascinating personalities who drove the company that did more than any other to take video games mainstream. The author's years of covering the industry and these people paid dividends in this section.<br />By contrast, the second half of the book, which mainly covers the rise of Sega, Nintendo and Sony, feels rushed and is far less comprehensive. Many part felt like rewrites of news articles, rehashing history rather than bestowing new insights. I don't want to sound too harsh, because this is a good overview, but this section falls short compared with the high standards set by the Atari history.<br />I also have a couple format quibbles. Many direct quotes are offset from the main text in bold. This is distracting. Some quotes simply repeat what had just been stated in regular text. I understand the need to back up assertions with quotes, but some of the comments are bland and don't really add anything.  Other sections begin with quotes that are only tangentially related to the ensuing text, or were from speakers who don't make further appearances or whose comments are not elaborated on. Another complaint is the use of excerpted passages from contemporary news articles that don't give the source up front but force the reader to look up footnotes in the back. If a passage is important enough to offset from the main text, the reader should be told right away who wrote it and in what publication.<br />Also, I thought the title was slightly misleading, since this is more a history of the video game *industry* rather than of video games themselves. A subtle distinction perhaps, but while there is background on certain titles, especially from the Atari years, I had expected more on actual games.<br />Overall, the book is informative and interesting though I believe it falls short of its lofty claim of being an &quot;ultimate&quot; history.
B00005Y1UX|5.0|A milestone on cinema? On some levels, yes. This film's moral structure &amp; general architecture is breathtaking. Add to this a perfect musical score and you get some of movie's finest moments.<br />Indecent Proposal is one of the most entertaining morality works out there. The moral to the story, without needing to go into theology or any other construct, is really simple: there's no such thig as a free ride. When most people were presented with this proposal so many or us said &quot;yes, in an instant&quot; and you wonder about the education standard of our country! The line of the seductive Robert Redford when Demi Moore accused him (while slowly being seduced by him herself) of being a man &quot;who likes to own things&quot; seems to sum up the entire film: &quot;You think I need to BUY women?&quot; Redford, a man in this piece who as a billionaire has seen and caused the evolution and destruction of multi-national corporations the size of an ancient egyptian empire, knew EXACTLY what would happen to this marriage, and to their mind- and to the heart, if they entered this contract knowingly and accepting this proposal most indecent. He knew the face of THEIR arrogance and the fragile nature of human relationships and the sometimes invisible architecture of the human soul; knowing, like every being with a secret plan for another human being, that that would bring about the predictable but unexpected chain of responsive events. The movie's most poignant twist comes when he reveals the route not taken in HIS own life, with all his money, and how that has generated much of his millions. Only then do we really discover under no uncertain terms what he desires, and what he is willing to embrace to get it. This begins the falling domino of epiphanies that leads to the revealing of the gentle but fragile hearts of all three of the characters, and the transcendent nature of love, committment and surrender.
B0000041WM|5.0|I agree, I found this CD a pleasant recording of Rigoletto.
B000063DFN|5.0|What else can I say except that this is without a doubt one of Iron Maiden's best efforts.The cd starts off with the classic song aces high and keeps you on your feet throughout the whole album.Excellent guitar work and you truly feel the vibe of the album.No Iron Maiden collection is complete without owning this classic work.PICK THIS UP TODAY AND UP THE IRONS!!!
0385720920|5.0|This read was extremely surprising.  It was hard to put it down and the end came together in a way you'd never imagine.  It was beautiful.  Chuck's way with words is irrisistable.  After this book I couldn't even wait till the next week to pick up another.  Any of his writing is worth the time, money, and effort.  Don't miss out.
B00005RFAI|1.0|She is just another trend like britney spears or eminem.The people who work with her in making her music ask her to appear as a tough weird chick in order to appeal to a certain demography of people in order to sell records.I almost fell asleep listening to the record because it is so bland and boring.Her voice is mediocre and the sound is too comercial for me.She has a real attitude problem and seems to be a manhating lesbian.PEOPLE PASS ON THIS ONE!!!
1400031354|5.0|This is my favorite of the 4 Ladies Detecttive Agency books written by A.M. Smith. All are charming, this one has a little more grit than the others, but you really should read all four; and I hope some more to come. The characters are all flawed, but this only makes you care about them and their struggles to find justice, love, and a place in a pretty hard world which the main characters embrace with all of their hearts.
B00005QG9J|5.0|i picked this cd up after hearing the single &quot;wish you were here&quot; and it is easily the best album i own, this cd never gets old no matter how manny times you listen to it. yeah it is a little mellower than s.c.i.e.c.e and Make Yourself but it just proves how much of a musical range incubus has. songs like 11am, mexico, and aqueous transmission, all of those songs just alone make this album worth buying, they are musical masterpieces.<BR>i strongly recommend getting this cd if you like any kind of music.
B0000C0FJB|3.0|I'm sorry but the audio is just terrible and poorly mixed.  This sounds like an audience bootleg, from the LAST row.  The band is pretty much mono and buried in constant audience noise.  The drums aren't clear enough and everything is kind of muddled together.  Such a shame for an amazing concert and set list.<br />What is frustrating is knowing that the actual music would have been recorded straight off the mixing board and would be very clear (just like ESL, SOH, or Different Stages), yet in post-production someone decided to mix in tons of audience noise to ruin an amazing recording.  This has nothing to do with having no sound check, older on-site recording equipment, etc.  None of that would have added so much audience noise on top of the board mix.  That's purely a post-production decision.<br />Disappointing for such an amazingly talented band.
B000092ZYX|5.0|If you haven't heard this CD yet, make sure to listen to it at least 5 times in various states of mind before you judge it.  (You know- Happy, Sad, Hungry, Lazy, etc.)  <br />It's that kind of music!<br />I fell in love with the song &quot;There, There&quot; the first time I heard it on the radio and went out of my way to download the rest of the album before it was released.  (Of course, I've bought it since.)<br />I have to admit, I listened to the album 4 or 5 times before I started appreciating all of it.  I can't remember my first reaction to songs like &quot;2+2=5&quot; and &quot;Go To Sleep&quot;, but can't now figure out a way that these songs didn't help suck me in.  Both of these songs are what I call 2-in-1 (and perhaps even 3-in-1) songs.  A typical music group would take the various parts of those songs make each of them one song, and then, of course, drive each of them into the ground for 6 minutes or so.  Instead, Radiohead creates one incredible song that ends sooner than you are used to.  <br />Make sure to listen to &quot;Sit Down. Stand Up.&quot;, &quot;Backdrifts&quot; and &quot;The Gloaming&quot; with headphones to get the full effect of these songs.  I'm getting dizzy just thinking about it.
B00008PC2O|5.0|I saw this back in 1991, when it was first released, and I said to myself then (at 9 yrs old), this was the best sci-fi ever made. I had seen Aliens (also directed by James Cameron) so many times before that, I didn't think there could be a better sci-fi. Then, T2 had to come into my life. I saw the special effects and Arnold back in action, and as most kids would say, that's what made the film great. But, since I've grown up and had time to watch it again (and I did, over and over), I realize it shouldn't have been the effects or Arnold I was looking at, but just the whole package. Aside from Arnold, reprising his role as The Terminator, everyone did a great job. Especially, Linda Hamilton (reprising her role as Sarah Connor), the young Edward Furlong as John Connor (the target this time around), and Morton (the unsuspecting scientist who was the brains behind the machine brainchild, Skynet, shot down by the cops).  <br />James Cameron was and is my favorite of all filmmakers alive today. I have other mentors, like Alfred Hitchcock and Frank Capra, but they're dead. I'm a hopeful filmmaker, struggling to get my start and Cameron's films, and the way he does things has given me a lot of motivation to get in the business. I wouldn't mind using his masterful skills in my own projects. T2 was one of those influential films from my upbringing. And, I thought the way movies, like Alien 3 and T3, continued and ended up ruining his storylines was almost like a crime. His ideas in both Aliens and T2 were so well thought out and told to us, those filmmakers doing those sequels screwed us as viewers.<br />So, in closing, T2 and even Aliens are the last great sequels of both those franchises. And, I have to agree with of the other reviews here. They are both two of the best sequels ever made; right up there with Bride Of Frankenstein and Empire Strikes Back.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|Let's face it, we were all anxiously waiting for the follow-up to the 1999 original that grabbed us all by the nuts and totally reinvented the sci-fi genre. For those years in between the sequel and the original everyone would talk about how &quot;insane&quot; the new movies would be, and finally the day came &quot;Matrix-Reloaded&quot; hit theaters, we ran to see it just as the film-makers had hoped, and then it was a thud! A thud heard across the country from countless fans. What the hell happened to our beloved franchise? What were the brothers thinking?<br />Sure there's some kick-ass stunts and sequences but altogether this&quot;Reloaded&quot; is just another LOAD!
B00005JLYW|1.0|Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle should have been renamed to <BR>Charlie's Angels: Everything But The Kitchen Sink.<br />Because?<br />Well because the director took it upon himself to throw just about every plot cliche and pop idol, explosion, popular actor/actress to get you the viewer to see this drivel.<br />Say what is the plot to this film?  <br />Plot?  I equate the plot to Swiss cheese.  Swiss has holes and the plot to Full Throttle has plot holes so big I can drive my car through them (I drive a Buick LeSabre BTW).  I always thought that Charlie Townsend ran a detective agency and not a top secrete spy shop ala CIA, NSA...etc.<br /> The beginning of the film has the angels in Mongolia of all places trying to bust out a justice department workers.  My question, which never is addressed, is how did this guy end<BR>up in Mongolia, especially if he holds one piece of a ring that holds encrypted ids for the witness protection program?<br />On top of that, the other ring, on the hands of another justice department worker is assassinated along with a whole team of agents.  My question is if you knew the first ring was stolen, wouldn't you want to maybe lockup the 2nd ring instead of <BR>giving it to some guy to waltz around with?  Or better yet, why store this info on rings to begin with?<br />Then lets stretch our disbelief by having 3 chicks perform all these physics defying martial art moves and escape Mongolia with the kidnapped worker sans the ring. <BR>Of course as the angels try to track down who stole the ring, they uncover that Dylan (Drew Barymore's character) is in the witness protection program (plot cliche).  Why who would've thunk of that?!<br />Also lets add that Dylan's ex-boyfriend, get released from a maximum security prison. Only after serving 8 years in jail. Well - I guess thats believable, right? Sort of like having John Giotti get out of jail and nobody says anything.<br /> Hello?<br />While we're at it, why not throw in Crispin Glover's ThinMan character from the 1st Charlie Angels film.  Crispin's character is now reduced to a mysterious screaming, hair sniffing Gomez Adams wannabe instead of the more intriguing martial arts sword<BR>wielding henchman of the first film.  Also the director and writers try, why I'll never know, to make Glover's character sympathetic and get the audience to feel for this guy.<BR>Like all of a sudden the movie wants to be character driven instead of plot driven?  My response to this is perhaps the director needs to get off the junk and think about where this story is going.<br />But, hey, lets not stop there.  Perhaps the audience will become board at lack of plot and the switching between driving this puppy by character or something trying to be a plot.  Lets throw in some pop stars like Pink or hey, Bruce Willis into the mix to generate some interest!  Hey, how about throwing in Jacqueline Smith into the film to give a T.V. Charlie's Angels passing the mantle to the new Charlie Angels.  Wouldn't that be great.  <br />By this time my wife is asking me why I'm more interested in reading my Newsweek magazine instead of watching anymore of this nightmare. Of course this movie wouldn't be complete without the coveted blooper reel as the credits role.  Yes, nothing like watching out take after out take of Barymore, Diaz, and<BR>Liu yuk it up over flubs and gaffs.  I can't help but wonder if they are laughing because they are having a good time or laughing at us for watching this really unwatchable film.
B0000C0FJB|5.0|Alright, the sound is a bit under produced, but that's a GOOD thing considering it's a LIVE CD. It's pure Rush, and sounds EXACTLY (Except for the MUCH louder Brazilian audience) like my show in Houston last year. This is Rush at their best. I recommend this CD ALONG with the DVD to EVERYONE. Not just for Rabid fans like myself. Worth a HELL of a lot more than you'd be paying. :-)
B0000C0FJB|3.0|Here's a to-the-point review for Rush fans:  the performance is great, the sound is disappointing (compared to &quot;Different Stages&quot; or even &quot;Animated&quot;), and the crowd noise is a bit intrusive (why do crowds in Brazil chant??).  The best-sounding cuts are the &quot;board bootlegs&quot; which aren't on the DVD and aren't from the Rio show.  I'm sure the DVD will be a better presentation of the performance.

B00000DOY2|4.0|Aretha Franklin isn't the queen of soul for nothing.  She certainly knows how to put feeling into her music.<br />I Never Loved A Man features many classic singles.  Respect is the most commercial song on here but there are other stand outs as well.  Dr. Feelgood is slow and sassy.  Save Me grooves along quite nicely.  And sleeper tracks like Good Times and Soul Serenade will always uplift your soul.<br />Whereas the music isn't as diverse as her greatest hits collections, there is plenty of charm on I Never Loved A Man to make the listening experience a good one.
B000089RVX|5.0|OMG! What an amazing album! It's been a long time since I am completely &quot;fallen&quot; for an entire CD, this one did it! What great sound, great vocal, simly refreshing, just wished I'd bought this CD sooner.
B000003CMC|5.0|Truly an Allman Brothers record where the band is at peak performance.  Yes there are only nine songs on this puppy including the 34 minute Mountain Jam.  However, the instrumental touches are truly grade A.  What fabulous drum solos on One Way Out, Mountain Jam, and Les Bres In A Minor.  The guitar duels between Dickey Betts and Duane Allman are legendary.<br />Many many highlights on this record.  Blue Sky is a such a joful tune with Dickey Betts' voice shing strong.  One Way Out is a super blues jam featuring classic blue wailing by Greg and the band belnding their instruments in full harmony.  Mellisa is such a pretty tune and Les Bres In A Minor is super creative.<br />Yes Mountain Jam can be a little long.  However, the Allmans  put in so many creative and driving touches that it has many captivating moments in spite of its length.  I realize that you have to be in the mood for something so long.<br />Overall, I have to round this CD to the full five stars.  The band is in top form and everyone of the recorded songs has at least some appeal with several being outstanding works of music.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|This middle installment of The Matrix trilogy begins about 6 months after the end of The Matrix.  Zion, the underground human sanctuary that was only talked about in the 1st film, is featured prominently.  Morpheus, Neo and crew have had great success in freeing more and more minds, but the machines are fighting back. They are tunneling down to Zion and will surely obliterate the city if allowed to reach it.  New insights into the nature of the Oracle are revealed.  She informs Neo that the &quot;key&quot; to the destruction of the machines is within the Matrix. Agent Smith is back in a big way; his apparent destruction at the hands of Neo in the 1st film has somehow freed him from the confines of the rules that govern the system.  He is a rogue program, overwriting other programs and making numerous copies of himself.  Perhaps he represents an evolution of artificial intelligence no longer content to simply exist. As he confronts Neo, he says that he intends to take from Neo what Neo took from him; &quot;purpose&quot;.  A search for purpose, for meaning in one's existence is a very human attribute.<br />A host of new characters are introduced.  In Zion there are members of the governing counsel and other cyber-warriors, some of whom strongly disagree with Morpheus' single-minded commitment to the prophesy of &quot;The One&quot;.  Within the Matrix there are new villains and a vital new character called &quot;The Keymaker&quot;.  The action has been ratcheted up a notch, including an amazing car/motorcycle/tractor-trailer chase sequence.  Neo soars like Superman through virtual skies, sometimes at such speed that he literally tears up the landscape in his wake.  But this film is less satisfying than the 1st, partly because it's the middle chapter, but also because some of the dialogue is so thick you could cut it with a knife.  Morpheus seems pompous and melodramatic here, spewing lines heavy with self-importance.  Neo has become so accomplished within the Matrix that he looks almost bored as he takes on all comers, leaving little doubt that he will prevail and thus diminishing suspense.  The love-conquers-all theme is revisited as the relationship between Neo and Trinity is developed.  But there are interesting revelations about the history of the Matrix; there is an implication that Agent Smith may be able to extend his influence into the real world; and the ending reveals a startling new development in Neo's abilities.  If the Wachowski brothers hit a home run with the final chapter, then the shortcomings of this film will be forgotten.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|There are a small number of films in the history of Hollywood that can actually be considered perfect. &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; with the incomparable Errol Flynn is one of them. With over a hundred reviews already, there is little for anyone to add. I will, however, provide a brief summary as to why this film is indeed perfect, a term I use very rarely.<br />The cast--the greatest of all swashbucklers at the peak of his charm and athleticism, Errol Flynn-- Olivia De Havilland, a lovely woman, a fine actress and an ideal partner for our hero--Basil Rathbone, oozing evil from every pore--Claude Rains, conniving and sinister as always--Eugene Palette, a jovial yet formidable Friar Tuck--Alan Hale as rough and ready Little John--and on and on--even the most minor character is just right.<br />The sets and costumes--absolutely gorgeous--the archery contest is just one of many scenes where technicolour shows its stuff !<br />The Directors--Messrs. Keighley and Curtiz could not have brought this legend to life more expertly.<br />The Music--unforgettable Korngold score.<br />Add all these ingredients and you have true cinema magic !<br />Warner Bros--the DVD is marvellous, and the extras on the second disc ( detailed in other reviews ) provide more treats for the lucky viewer. What a beautiful job !<br />So--if you have that dreary Kevin Costner/Robin Hood DVD, throw it on the trash heap, and revel in the real thing ! A triumph !
B00003CXZ4|5.0|It's not uncommon for a film to start at the end of the story, then explain through flashback what led up to that moment.  MEMENTO starts at the end, but is anything but common, because it then progresses backward in time.  Each 5 to 10 min. segment (shot in color) occurs at a point in time just prior to the one before.  Interspersed within this reverse narrative are B&amp;W scenes in chronological order which, if all put together, lead up to the final segment, which is the beginning of the story.  How could something that sounds so confusing make a watchable film, you might ask?  It's a tribute to screenwriter/director Nolan that he created such a compelling and thought-provoking mystery/thriller from such a framework.  It's rare to find an unconventional approach to film making that really works..and this does.<br />Guy Pierce is excellent in the role of Lenny, a man who has suffered a severe head injury while trying to defend his wife against an attack by burglars.  This injury has left him incapable of making new memories; he retains nothing for more than 5 or 10 mins.  He can't watch a half hour TV show because by the end, he's forgotten how it started.  His condition is not amnesia; he knows who he is and recalls everything about his life before the injury.  His brain simply won't retain any new experiences.  <br />Lenny's wife was raped and murdered by her attackers, leaving him devastated and filled with rage.  A police investigation turned up a suspect known only as &quot;John G.&quot;  Of course, Lenny's injury would quickly cause him to forget all of this, so he has his chest tattooed with &quot;John G. raped and murdered my wife&quot;.  His quest to find and kill   the man who ruined his life is what gives him purpose.  In order to function, he is constantly taking Polaroids and making notes to refer back to after he's forgotten.  The most important clues that he uncovers he has tattooed all over his body.  Lenny's mission is complicated by two people with ulterior motives who take advantage of his dysfunction.  One is Teddy (Pantoliano), a cop helping him find the killer; the other is Natalie (Moss), a woman he meets along the way who he thinks may be able to help him.<br />Christopher Nolan adapted the screenplay (which was nominated for an Oscar) from a short story by his brother, Jonathan Nolan.  The genius of the script is that it mimics Lenny's handicap in that the viewer doesn't know what preceded the current scene, just as Lenny doesn't know because he's forgotten!  It raises intriguing questions about the role of memory in our perception of reality.  At one point, Lenny is thinking out loud about his predicament.  He wonders how many times he's been reminded and forgotten that his wife is gone.  Imagine learning that a loved one has died, over and over, each time as if it were the first.  &quot;How can I heal if I can't feel time?&quot;  How can he trust others that he only knows through scribbled notes on photographs?  In a surprise revelation near the end of the film, we find that Lenny can't really &quot;know&quot; anything because he can't even trust himself.  Because this film is so unconventional and tough to fully absorb in one viewing, some impatient folks will consider it a waste of time.  But MEMENTO is extremely well made (Oscar nominated for Best Film Editing) and well worth the effort for anyone who appreciates film as art and is not intimidated by complexity.
B000002LQR|5.0|This is definitely the best peppers album. Anyone who listens to anything made in the past 50 years should at least dowload &quot;under the bridge&quot;, as this is one of the greatest songs ever written (right up there with &quot;Stairway&quot;) and is unfortunately not on the demo list. The album falls right in between their start with &quot;freaky styley&quot; and the most recent &quot;by the way&quot;, with a range of styles from a hardrock/rap mix in &quot;give it away&quot; and &quot;suck my kiss&quot; to a much softer, but still classic &quot;under the bridge&quot;. If you've somehow missed out on the chili peppers altogether, think of them as the only band my thug roommates (who have never even heard of zeppelin, steppenwolfe, or the who) and i (who hadn't heard of 50 cent until about a month ago) can agree on. My parents liked this cd, and so do all of my freinds, so it truly is a must have for all.
B000002UC5|4.0|The release of McCartney in 1970 signalled the rest of the world that the Beatles were no more.  Yet it should be emphasized that the blame shouldn't fall on Paul, as he was the one who coaxed any of his bandmates when they threatened to quit.  Maybe he realized they were right after all, that the Apple was rotting from the inside.<br />After the tumultuous breakup, I wonder if the idyllic guitar and piano works of whimsy reflected the quieting Paul needed.  The album starts with the brief ditty &quot;The Lovely Linda&quot;, an ode to...well, gee, it must be his wife... haha, we then get the guitar and drum &quot;That Would Be Something&quot; which is concatenated with &quot;to meet you in the falling rain, mama.&quot; to be repeated over and over.<br />The instrumental jam &quot;Valentine Day&quot; has bluesy guitar riffs reminiscent of the Let It Be and Abbey Road sessions, and sounds like something John would've done on the latter session.  It proves though, that it was unfair to lump Paul as specializing in singing sweet ballads only; he could rock and roll too.<br />The sweet but jangly guitar number &quot;Every Night&quot; demonstrates Paul's quiet vocal, with his lyrical and idyllic waxing.  It's one of my favourites here, and would've fitted perfectly on Abbey Road or The White Album.  &quot;Every night I lay on the pillow resting my mind/every morning brings a new dawn/every night that day is thru/but tonight I just want to stay in and be with you.&quot;  Nice stuff there.<br />The upbeat guitar instrumental &quot;Hot As Sun Glasses&quot; sports some spright keyboards before yielding to &quot;Junk&quot;, a quiet guitar number in the manner of &quot;Blackbird&quot;.  This look at the &quot;sentimental jamboree&quot; in the yard makes one go &quot;why&quot;?, as the things one discards tells a story of one's life.<br />&quot;Man We Was Lonely&quot; with a sing-song melody is another song that could've been a White Album candidate.  It's seems to be a song about his time with the Beatles:  &quot;when we were hard-pressed to find a smile/but now we're fine all the while&quot;  That doesn't matter now that he's with Linda, he seems to be saying.<br />Another bluesy rock song that could've fit on either White or Let It Be is &quot;Oo You.&quot;  Then comes another instrumental jam, with rolling bass and drums, piano, and keyboards--&quot;Momma Miss America.&quot;  After two minutes of that, some blustery electric bluesy guitar reminiscent to the solo of &quot;For What It's Worth&quot; comes in, accompanied by piano, which later has some glissandos towards the end.  This could've been a good movie instrumental.<br />The title boy in the &quot;Teddy Boy&quot; gets a shock when his mother, with whom he lives alone and tries to please after the death of the father in the war, takes up with another man.<br />&quot;Singalong Junk&quot; is an instrumental reprise of &quot;Junk&quot;, and here, I can hear the pianos and strings hidden by the vocal version.  The other standout, &quot;Maybe I'm Amazed&quot; demonstrates the two sides of Paul, quiet melodic vocals and piano and his Little Richard-influenced screams punctuated by guitar.  The devotion nurtured between and he and his wife is demonstrated here, especially  after his final bitter days with the Beatles:  &quot;maybe I'm amazed by the way you love me all the time/maybe I'm afraid of the way I love you/maybe I'm amazed by the you pulled me out of time/hung me on the line/maybe I amazed at the way I really need you.&quot;  If I found someone like that, you'll be the first to know.<br />&quot;Kreen-Akore&quot; A final instrumental of mostly drums, with guitars and funny sounds, breathing, and harmonies by him and Linda inbetween.  Given the quiet minimalist sounds prevalent from the White Album (&quot;I Will&quot;) or Abbey Road (&quot;Something&quot;), I wonder if this is what Paul's contributions to a successor of to Let It Be would've been had one not become four in 1970.Maybe I'll know more when Let It Be...Naked comes out on 17 November, then compare that with McCartney. Not a classic by any means, but it's a first step and breather before he and Linda became a band on the run five years later.Maybe I'll know more when Let It Be...Naked comes out on 17 November, then compare that with McCartney. Not a classic by any means, but it's a first step and breather before he and Linda became a band on the run five years later.

B00005JL3A|1.0|I was reluctant to watch resident evil, considering it was based on a video game. Well, my fears were realized in this hack-n'-slash skin fest. First the good: the first fifteen minutes were excellent. Great tension, great screenplay, excellent action. (Especially the scene where they are trapped in the elevator). The movie went down hill from there, into some campy zombie-killing thriller featuring an impractically clad heroine, and dozens of super-model looking commandos. sorry, I had to pass on finishing this, about the time the woman woke up in the mansion, my brain began to go numb. Perhaps the sequel will be better? But then again, considering the success of past video-game based films, perhaps not...
B000002LND|5.0|Being The Greatest hits seller by a female artist, I believe Immaculate will hit the 12 million mark in the U.S alone soon, it still sales between 3 to 5 thousand weekly, its already at 10.5 million. World Wide over 22 million, and for being a hit collection(WOW)its hard believe it only stalled at #2 here in the U.S. enough said! this is a for EVERYBODY album to have, fan or non fan it fits anyone who grew up in the 80's even 90's. just cannot avoid it, Im sure non fans can relate or atleast at one point like one madonna song.......... thanks....

B000055Y12|4.0|This is perhaps the only Alfred Hitchcock color film I have not seen, until now.  It is a rarity for television.  And it would be edited for television broadcast anyway.  Now on DVD, you can see TOPAZ in its entirty.  If you have seen TOPAZ before, well here is the surprise.  There are three very different endings of the film you may have not seen yet.  This DVD version will show them all to you.   If the ending chosen leaves you flat, in the Bonus Material section, you can see all three alternate endings and decide the one you like best. John Forsythe (Bachelor Father [1957-62], [[ASIN:B00008WJEZ Charlie's Angels - The Complete First Season]] [1976-1981] as voice of \\"Charlie\\",  [[ASIN:B000QUEQ72 Dynasty - Seasons 1 & 2]][1981-89]) sure does make the beginning act of the film much more interesting to watch.  I can not say this is the best of Hitchcock.   May I would recommend: [[ASIN:B00003CXC7 Rear Window (Collector's Edition)]] (1954) and [[ASIN:B000ECX0O2 Rope]] (1948).
B00000F1D3|4.0|This Believe album is good. Very well put together,, But To Mr.Mc Cartney. Madonna's (Ray of Light) was NOT out sold by cher sorry buddy you wrong, Ray of Light is now at 4.5 million copies in the U.S alone, and is at 15.0 million copies world wide and peak at #2 for 2 weeks in 1998. Cher album peak at #4. this is not to put Cher down in anyway, But A proven fact is that what Cher has done in the last 45 years or so, Madonna has done it in 10 years. and has remained in the spotlight/charts since 1983 through 2003 and currently at debuted on th HOT 100 at #50.  But dont get me wrong Cher rocks since 1998 was her return,/ Madonna never left. and also has more fans of all ages.  thanks
B000002U82|2.0|I have always heard of this album as the \\"greatest of all times\\", hundreds of years in Billboard's top 100, billions of copies sold and things like that, so that I longed for such a long time to listen to, enjoy and buy it, and put it among my favorite CDs.<BR>Until one day I listened.<BR>Big deal, really! <BR>I used to think an album is great when it's made of great songs, but maybe I was wrong, `cause I couldn't find one on this one. It's just a mess of useless noises mixed with boring and prolix songs.<BR>The \\"noises\\", oh, they're great, expecially if we consider that this was made in the 70's, but when they come up with the \\"ordinary\\" songs, all I can hear is the usual Pink Floyd-style superslow ballads ( la \\"Comfortably Numb\\", the only decent one, and it's not on this album).<BR>There's only one track I like somehow and it's \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\", but it's instrumental , it should be preceded or followed by some real good songs, but this is not the case. As for the greatly overrated \\"Money\\", it is good, but I heard better ones, it is catchy, but I heard far more catchy ones, it has clever lyrics, but I heard cleverer ones.<BR>It's not that I don't like alternative music - I'm not gonna make a list of my favourite groups, that's not the purpose of my review, but I can swear I'm not used to listening to crappy pop or hip-hop, nor am I a punk or metal addicted who cannot appreciate mellower tunes - it's that in my own view, a song needs something special to be great - the melody, the rhythm, the combination of sounds - and though most people seem to disagree, I cannot see anything of this among these tracks, nor among Pink Floyd's songs in general, with few exceptions. And, since I went this far, let me go farther and even be blaspheme: I find them quite repetitive; and when I want to listen to some good repetitive music, I turn the stereo on and listen to \\"Dookie\\".
B00005Q66T|3.0|.Its cool to see most here seem to really like this album, Its a good collection, thats to show Madonna is the queen and king of pop music.    The only artist alive with 3 collections if hits and still charting after ghv-2. for instance 2002 (Die another day) peak at # 8 for 2 weeks on the hot 100. 2003 (American life) peak at #37 thats impressive. And (Hollywood) #1 on the dance and sales charts, and now with Miss Spears back on the hot 100 with (Me against the music), debuting at # 50 and word is that song will rise atleast into the top 20.WHAT'S UP!!!  I graded this GHV-2, a 3 stars, Its good but she could had maded it better by adding a mega mix of all theses hits in one or end the album with a new track. Though not much promotion GHV-2 was able to sale over 167.000 copies its first week and nearly 200.000 by its 2 week. and to date, since 2001 it has shipped over 1.3 million copies in the U.S and now over 5 million world wide. GO MADONNA!!
0446310786|3.0|The main story of \\"To Kill a Mocking Bird\\" tells the tale of Jem and Scout Finch, brother and sister and children of lawyer Atticus. When a young man is accused of the rape of a white woman, Atticus agrees, amidst tremendous controversy, to defend the accused in the town's court of law. During the lead up to the case Scout and Jem have to tolerate racial slurs and insults because of their fathers role. In spite of his brilliant performance in the courtroom and the overwhelming evidence against the white family's accusations the defendant is found guilty. He is later shot dead whilst in Prison. <BR>The issues of this book include poverty against wealth, racial separations and boundaries, relationships between people, religion and self-discovery. A book packed with issues is always thought provoking and this is no exception. <BR>There are three main characters in the book, Scout a tomboy who looses her temper a lot, Jem her older brother who is the more level-headed of the two and Atticus their laid back, gentle Dad. The book is written in Scouts perspective giving you an insight to her views of life. Other characters include Dill, a young boy that spends summers with Jem and Scout, Bob Ewell a nasty lazy drunkard whose daughter is the accuser from Atticus's case and Boo Radley. Boo Radley is the mysterious character that was once accused of stabbing his father in the leg with a pair of scissors. <BR>The style of this book is in the narrative of Scout. The genre of this book I think now is slightly dated and old.<BR>Personally I thought this book was interesting to read although probably only once. I think that this was because I found it really slow at the beginning but it did get gradually better towards the end as there is a big twist in the storyline. One good point to this book is that after reading this book your vocabulary is enriched with long completed words. I can understand the book but I am slightly unsure what all the fuss is about? Maybe when I'm older my interests will have changed and I will want to read this book a lot more? I mean don't get me wrong this book is well written and everything but considering it takes a lot of concentration to read it, it didn't really leave me with a satisfied feeling. I wasn't inspired.
B000051Y0G|4.0|I remember this album. the only track that really recall is (girls just wanna have fun). after maybe true colors.. I love cyn still today I got to see her here in san diego last year she really good, this old songs brought back the 80's for me, But i cannot stand how this album (shes so unusual) to madonna, Look face it, once Madonna broke out with like a virgin Cyn was done, So please do not compare theses two ladies work, it makes me sick..

B0000C7PQK|4.0|hi there. well... i bought the new voyageur cd, that after i saw the special cd packaging :)<BR> <BR>after listening, i have to say that there is not such a huge change in the essence, but it is much more soft listening, less (or no) complicated lyrics, no voice samples, it is... very airy...<BR> <BR>yet, it's a pleasant album, nice music, and cretu's voice seems to add a little complication to the songs (the inflexions of his voice at the end of 'Incognito' sound just like BT's voice on 'Somnambulist' - same voice effect, same melodic voice line). i'm not quite happy with the track titles, i think they're kinda silly and... usual (if not overused).<BR> <BR>in the end, i think everyone may agree that perfect production and perfect sounds save the day! and it's a happy ending for voyageur, who has almost no identity and no message at all. it is maybe a new beginning, it is enigma but reduced at it's musical essence (and adding more commercial beats), during the album you can hear samples from the first enigma MCMXC aD (first there's the 'Sad, dis-moi' whispers, and then on 'The Piano' the melodic line follows the one from 'Sadness')<BR> <BR>so the message one can understand is that this is some new ground for enigma, or is the journey to a new ground, leaving behind old samples and instruments. The very last sounds at the end of the album are really enchanting, really enigma and they may be most relevant for what's next and also for the message of this recording.<BR> <BR>drawing a line, i can say that cretu has not proved that he could change something in music with this album, it has no serious innovation on it, but i'm not even sure he had to prove something like that, yet it would be nice to see enigma in different clothes and from a different perspective, something that fits the future or maybe anticipate it. this is where cretu's genious would shine. else, we could see that cretu is a good composer, that he can come up with good tracks, nice arrangements and great sounds.
B00000373U|5.0|I am writing this one day after the untimely death of the great singer/songwriter. I can only feel thankful for giving us his great music to forever remember him by. 'Either/Or' is his best. The great indie classic is sweet and tender aching with pain that now seems very apparent after his suicide. Highlights include 'Pictures of Me', 'Between the Bars', 'No Name No. 5', 'Cupid's Trick' and 'Angeles'. Goodbye Elliot Smith, God bless you, your music will live forever.
B0000C9V3T|4.0|A good soundtrack gives the listener all the integral music from the film's most important scenes, and helps the listener relieve those scenes away from the theatre. A great soundtrack does this while managing to fit almost all the music and actually deliver them in order of the film. Not exactly gospel criteria, but this is how I organize my soundtracks, and Kill Bill Vol. 1 is a great disc. <br />Any fans of the film will enjoy this disc simply because most of all the important tracks are on here. Highlights definately include Nancy Sinatra's murder ballad 'Bang Bang' (played during the opening credits after that first chilling scene) tracks 9 and 10 (played during the House of Blue Leaves massacre) and the great Twisted Nerve, which Daryl Hannah's character whistles on her way in an attempt to dispatch a prone Uma Thurman. Also prime tracks are The Grand Duel (a great Morricone'esque spaghetti western tune) and The Flower of Carnage, a lovely little japanese tune played during a bittersweet scene from the film.<br />My only complaint is the missing songs, such as the beautiful hymn-like tune played during Uma Thurman's attaining her sword, but it's understandable not being able to fit everything here. Instead, we are granted all the trailers accessable on the CD, including the Bootleg trailer, containing footage from Vol. 2!<br />Personally, i loved this CD and readily anticipate the sequel.
B00006JLX4|5.0|Pavement's original debut is a raw, garage rock masterpeice and the re-issue is even better. With added live recordings, b-sides, unreleased tracks and enough indie bliss to send you straight to the moon (48 tracks on two discs). This rugged trash talking clever ride knocks the door down with 'Summer Babe' and the hilarious image of \\"she's eating her fingers like they're just another meal\\". Highlights include the rich 'Zurich is Stained', the climatic 'Here' and the anthem like chant of 'Two States'. There are great live performances of 'Two States', 'Summer Babe', 'No Life Singed Her' and others. The John Peel session #2 is fantastic and the possibly the best new track is the lovely 'Secret Knowledge of Backroads'. This is a must have album and indie's finest. Not to mention the bands first and best.
B00000JR2A|5.0|If you love music, well now you've found your favorite CD! Seeds of Love is my absolute favorite CD out of the 450+ I own. It is poetic, beautifully written, incredibly creative and heartstopping. Woman in Chains will make you cry and Badman's Song will make you jump up, dance and sing. You will find yourself closing your eyes and physically absorbing every lyric. Turn it up loud and let the sweet but powerful music wash over you. You will love and cherish every single note!!!
0767830555|5.0|Scorsese's dark and brutal tale of an isolated outsider who wonders the Big Apple behind the wheel of his taxi cab, a job he takes and works relentless hours to fill his sleepless nights. He observes what he calls &quot;Scum and garbage&quot; polute the streets. Tips from a fellow cabby and an insatible desire to do something big leads to an assasination attempt on a presidential candidate. When that plan flops he turns his sights on saving a young prostitute, played well by a young Jodie Foster. This heroic or psychotic rampage depending how you look at it, (I'm partial to the latter) leads to a bloody climax. Taxi Driver is a brilliant character study and a stunning betrayal of New York City in the 70's. Great direction and an outstanding performance by DeNiro. The film, it's direction and it's star deserve all the awards in the world that it didn't win and will always demand our attention.
B0000DCGT4|1.0|American Wedding will work for anyone who wants to see classic charaters (the few who remain, anyway) pushed to the comedic extreme without any concern for a possible trainwreck. It is indeed a trainwrek; everything you liked about the first two American Pies cannot be found here. After the first five minutes is becomes a different movie, different enough that it will remain thebad apple of the triology forever and by any measure.<br />What made the American Pie series work is left behind in this mostly mindness, half-baked attempt to rekindle success with forced comedy, stolen skits (thank you Zoolander for inspiring a dance off), and shallow gags that last too long. <br />This movie proves why Stiffler was a supporting character in the first two movies as his antics--which now include a squeeky laugh with every line and ann extension of his geneder crisis--grow tiresome by the second. Finch swings back and forth from a unemotioned monk to reaction man. Michelle degresses from her development into a real person in the last movie and turns into the bone queen. And Jim obviously had his mind elsewhere, perhaps that this was likely his last movie.<br />The acting for many is forced at best, which can only be attributed to worst script. Even the most seasoned actors struggled at times. In fact, the script was so bad, it makes one wonder whether the writer never wrote the old characters into the movie or they simply had the good sense to stay out.<br />In sum, I intend to stick to my old rule of thumb from now on. When a movie has such a short run in the theater, never buy it sight unseen. Rent it first. Had I stuck to this rule to begin with, I'd be out $3 bucks instead of $20.
0792842103|4.0|its quick and its great with a good cast starring Robert DeNiro(City By The Sea, Raging Bull, ShowTime), Jean Reno(Leon The Professional, Godzilla1998, Rollerball2001), Natasha McElhone(The Truman Show, Solaris2002), Stellan Skarsgard(Deep Blue Sea, Savior, The Glass House), Sean Bean(Dont Say A Word, GoldenEye, Patriot Games), Jonathan Pryce(Regeneration, Tomorrow Never Dies) , Skipp Sudduth(tv's Third Watch) and others bring this movie its spark. the premise is DeNiro and company go after a suitcase and then half way in things start to go array and some of his members turn on him. good car chases.

B0000DBJDM|2.0|Well, it seems PINK FLOYD: LIVE AT POMPEII director Adrian Maben has got himself a case of George Lucas disease. The new DVD release of the so-called \\"Director's Cut\\" of that film is completely re-edited, with a slew of new material, and it completely ruins the mood of the film. Thankfully, they included the original version of this haunting movie on the disc, as well. There's a drastic difference between the two.<br />Here's the deal:<BR>The original version of the film, released in 1972, was 61 minutes long, and consisted only of performance footage from the Pompeii amphitheatre and a Paris studio, plus some extra footage of Pompeii. This was shot in full-screen 4:3 and is presented as such on the DVD.<br />Maben went back into the Abbey Road studios while the band was putting together DARK SIDE OF THE MOON in 1973 and shot some documentary footage of the band recording and talking. The new footage was spliced in between some of the original performances for the film and the result was released in 1974 in America; it was maybe 70-something minutes long. Unfortunately, this edit has not made it to the DVD.<br />Now, this new version uses more footage from Abbey Road, some B&W<BR>footage of the band in a studio in Paris, new shots the director took of Pompeii, a whole bunch of archival footage of space exploration, and new titles that look made for a straight-to-video release instead of the Godard-esque ones we had with the original (Willy Kurant was one of the cinematographers.) This is about 91 minutes long, and has been inexplicably matted to a 16:9 format.<br />I must say the new footage seems extremely out of place. It doesn't match visually with the old footage, looking very straight-to-video. Much of the editing of the original is broken up with splices to new stuff the director just couldn't keep out (\\"Hey, Pink Floyd is \\"spacey\\"--- I'll put in computer-generated shots of planets!\\"); the result is more a series of thematically related music videos than a unified movie. What really gets me is that there's an interview on the DVD with the director where on multiple occasions he touches on why the original and almost-original versions of the film were so special, and then he proceeds to destroy that with his new version.<br />In the original, the ruined Pompeiian setting gave the movie a<BR>palpable sense of silence and isolation; in the new version they're not much more than a pretty background. The original version held its shots long enough to give the viewer an opportunity to absorb the spacial setting for himself; now we're treated to the short attention span version of things. And why was this this thing masked to 16:9 for the new version? Having a dad who's worked on satellites and space probes my whole life has given me an appreciation for space footage on its own merits; but using simulated flyovers of Mars's surface to accompany Pink Floyd is worthy of a fan's website, not a feature film... please, let the spirit of \\"Laserium\\" rest in peace.
B00004YYDI|4.0|though some people didnt find this movie moving or great but I did. its about a hitman named Leon(Jean Reno) who gets involved with Natalie Portman after her family gets killed by Gary Oldman and his henchmen. Portman wants revenge for her familys death and Reno shows her the way. with some non-stop action that brings the movie to its title name. Oldman is great to watch as the mad pill popping dirty cop.
B00006JIA4|3.0|How do you compile 3 whole CDs worth of Queen songs and manage to leave off Keep Yourself Alive?
6305169187|3.0|it was a flop at the box office but I liked it because I like Bruce Willis and he's great in this. certain people will find some of the story without logic but there's great fun with the supporters like, Will Patton, Michael Clarke Duncan, Liv Tyler, Billy Bob Thornton, Keith David, William Fichtner, Peter Stormare, Ben Affleck, Steve Buscemi, Ken Campbell and Owen Wilson(especially Wilson, but did he have to die, huh). some of the effects are good but then again not so good. the end sure brought tears to my eyes when Willis died instead of Affleck.
B00005JM0B|4.0|I thought Terminator 3 was outstanding! To follow Judgement day and still be on the same caliber is unbelievable. I think with the way the movie ended Terminator 4 should definately happen. I really enjoyed Nick Stahl playing John Conner. I mean furlong was fine for connor as a winy 10 year old but as a 22 year old man about to lead a world against machines, he wouldn't have pulled it off. I have yet to get the dvd of T3 but I'm hoping to get it the day it comes out. I'm also hoping for T 4 even if Arnold isn't in it. The way the third movie was played out, it felt as if Arnold was passing the story on to Stahl and Danes. And the two of them were wondeful. And having good old Dr. Silverman in it was even greater. Here hopes T 4 happens. Wouldn't you like to know how it all began. Where Kyle Reece came from. What he was like. How John beat the machines. Terminator 4 I'LL BE BACK to watch
6304258984|4.0|a top notch action thriller is one of the best action movies of 1996. its about Ed Harris and hes fed up with crap so he organizes a team and they hold up Alcatraz because he's going to launcha missle that'll kill a lot of people. Nicolas Cage, with Sean Connery(a man who knows Alcatraz like he knows his foes), Michael Biehn and a team of professionals go to The Rock and try to get the missles and stop Harris from killing innocent people. some stupid oneliners but otherwise its great with a car chase, missles flying, people eating toxic green balls. it has everything a action movie cooks up. theres a great team of other actors like William Forsythe, John Spencer, Vanessa Marcil, Tony Todd, Bookem Woodbine, John C. Mcginley, Steve Harris and Anthony Clark(who is gay and funny in this movie) that cook up those ingredients and give us a good ride
