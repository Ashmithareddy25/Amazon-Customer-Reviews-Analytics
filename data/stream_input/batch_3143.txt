1451627297|5.0|Outstanding. Amazing. Genius. With 1000's of other reviews on here it hardly seems worthwhile adding another view. But this book is SO good, I can't avoid it.<br /><br />Don't be put off by the size, and don't worry if it might seem like you're in for a long history lesson as you are nothing of the sort. The story is absolutely gripping, the words fly by and you won't want it to end. Half-way through, I thought this book was almost as good as anything he's written. By the end I knew it was the best. If not the best book I've ever read. As a fledgling author it both inspires me and makes me want to put the pen down, knowing I will never be able to write anything this strong.<br /><br />Buy it. Read it. Then read it again. You won't be disappointed.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|Allegiant is unlike any other book I’ve read. The view on the world and on the way that people think is expressed in a way I have never seen before. This book brings to light the importance of true love, forgiveness, bravery, and true sacrifice.<br /><br />Being the last book in the series, you have no way of knowing what is going to happen, because there are no more books to reassure you that the main character will survive. This only adds to the perfectly created plot that has everything from romance to hard-core action. Tris is strong, brave, and has a mind of her own. She decides to join a rebel group that will leave the city to explore outside the borders of the city. And once she does, everything becomes a lot more complicated. And in the midst of all this is a representation of what it means to be brave, and the deference between what is right and what is morally wrong.<br /><br />This book made me laugh, cry, scream, sob, smile, grin, and everything in between. The words are so perfectly crafted I felt as though I was right there with the characters. Veronica Roth continually tests your sanity with intense, vivid, and for anyone who’s looking for a book that will end in a way never expected, I give them this book, and a prayer for their sanity. Because this book, will blow their mind.
0142403873|5.0|This book has it all! It's a very creative story about the little guy overcoming odds by using his wit and imagination. The monster in the book was introduced in a way that was not frightening to my children at all - in fact they loved the suspense, and hoped to meet the Gruffalo! The poetry has an excellent meter, and is very fun for parents to read. I highly recommend this book, and the short film DVD which is also available.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is extremely addicting. I started playing it on my computer. Then on my phone. And now on my kindle! I'm glad there is a life limit. Otherwise I'd never get anything done.

B00BD99JMW|4.0|It took me two whole days to accept this book. I hated it for a few hours, was looking for some hidden chapter, or the always popular 90s catch phrase \\"psych\\". To my at first extreme disappointment it wasn't there. Then it stewed inside and I thought it out and there was true resolution. It couldn't have folded out any other way.  I am clearly not a YA, but I'm a girl  so I get what everyone wanted. Just live with it for a little while, and maybe you'll find it just a poetic of a story as I did.

B00EW9GQR6|3.0|One of the brilliant things about Lady Gaga's \\"Born This Way\\" was just how varied the song styles were. It was like she took a sponge over the best of what the 80's and 90's had to offer, sopped it up, then wrung it out all over her music. A little Madonna, a little Prince, even a little Springsteen. It was an 'everything but the kitchen sink' approach and it worked to an amazing effect. Now, after riding a tidal wave of personality and more hype than just about any pop album in the last few years, we get \\"ArtPop.\\" What was an amalgamation before now just comes off as rote. Her personality still compensates for a lot here, but this is not much more than a standard issue laptop dance album. After Katy Perry's disappointing \\"Prism,\\" \\"Artpop\\" carries too much baggage and ultimately fails to deliver the goods.<br /><br />The opener, the middle eastern tinged \\"Aura,\\" does give the album a major kickstart, but even then it just ascends into electronic dance music. There's the three rappers on \\"Jewels and Drugs,\\" which does not one up having Kanye West on the last album. And for friggin' sakes, a pot puffing song in \\"Mary Jane Holland\\"? If I wanted Myley Cyrus, I would've bought \\"Bangerz.\\" The profanities are gratuitous, the songs sound-alikes, and the lack of variety gets painfully obvious after a couple of listens.<br /><br />The saving graces come mostly from the singles. \\"Applause\\" was enough of a bell-ringer that I was prepared for a solid album. Odd that it is what closes the album. \\"Venus\\" is also fun, where the worldplay may be juvenile (Uranus, hee hee hee), but the hook inescapable. The duet with R Kelly is a big surprise as the old school crooner is a perfect match for a subdued Gaga on \\"Do What U Want\\" (even the title is a throwback, in the way the best songs on \\"Born This Way\\" were). That's only four songs that I think will interest me long enough to go back to the album for. Lady Gaga is now in danger of becoming something I was hoping she'd be able to avoid; \\"Artpop\\" reveals the artist as cookie-cutter poptart saved mainly by that larger than life character she's invented for herself.\\"Artpop\\" reveals the artist as cookie-cutter poptart saved mainly by that larger than life character she's invented for herself.

B00EP0SIOG|4.0|Before receiving my Sphero, I watched a very entertaining review on YouTube about it (by JuanBagnell) in which he pointed out that Sphero feels like it has a gerbil inside it.  And yeah, it really does.  An excited, manic little gerbil.  Once I got my Sphero, we quickly began to refer to it as \\"he\\" and \\"him,\\" because it really does seem to be alive at times.  I particularly enjoy having Sphero to nuzzle up against my daughter, and it seems like he's doing it all on his own.  As weird as it sounds, we both have a lot of affection for this little guy.<br /><br />On the positive side of things, Sphero has a lot of speed and it's fun to pick what color you want him to be (despite my impression of him being male, my poor Sphero is usually pink or lavender).<br /><br />I know a lot of technology and research and development went into this thing, but I think the manufacturer, Orbotix, missed the boat on so many counts.<br /><br />First of all, Sphero can't do much.  He's kind of hard to control (aiming him onto the included little ramps is frustratingly difficult).  He's just this little ball that you can remotely cause to roll around.  You can use a \\"rainbow\\" function that makes him randomly change colors for a minute or so, but why not have that as a setting you can just turn on and leave on?  Or how about other customizable light settings?  It would have been cool to have been able to control him like LED Christmas lights with different effects.  It seems like that would have been so easy to do, yet they didn't.  Perhaps they are waiting for someone else to develop an app for it.<br /><br />Sphero also has a \\"spazz\\" function where he kind of hops around for a couple of seconds.  If he can have THAT much movement, why not program in other options?  I'd love for him to just roll around in a little pattern by himself so I could sit back and watch him.<br /><br />The spazz function often causes the aiming of Sphero to get out of kilter (as does driving him around erratically or running into things), so be prepared to often have to stop and re-aim him.<br /><br />I was really disappointed to realize that Sphero does not have sufficient traction and power to play with him on my lawn.  He just spins in place.  I could buy the separate \\"Nubby\\" cover, which will probably give him sufficient power to roll in the grass, but at this price point, considering that rolling is ALL Sphero can do, it just seems that a clear or white Nubby cover should have been included.  Unfortunately, not only was it not included, you can't even buy it separately!  At the moment, only orange is available (and that was \\"temporarily unavailable\\" until just recently), with blue and green coming sometime in the future.  But I don't see clear or white in the pipeline, and that's really what I'd prefer (to let Sphero's pretty colors shine through).<br /><br />The Orbotix software for Sphero is very buggy.  It crashes a lot, and I often have to \\"rename\\" my Sphero for no apparent reason.<br /><br />Speaking of renaming, the software does not currently have an option for renaming your Sphero.  I wrote to the company and asked about it, and the rep asked for my Sphero's MAC number (very hard to see in the software) and color code (when you start up Sphero, he flashes three different colors, which vary from one Sphero to another).  Then the rep told me that to rename Sphero, you should start up another Sphero app, then back out before using it, and when you go back into the Orbotix software, you can rename your Sphero.  This does work, but I really resent that the customer service guy made me jump through hoops rather than just telling me that.  And why isn't there just a settings control within the software to do this?<br /><br />And ever since I got Sphero, the Orbotix software kept promising that something was going to happen on 11/12/13 (\\"DEFEND,\\" it cryptically says), but that date came and went without any change to Sphero (including the \\"DEFEND\\" screen, which still shows).  What the heck is that about?  (UPDATE:  With the next release of software, that screen no longer shows, but there is now an advertisement screen imploring you to \\"join the Robolution,\\" which means applying to be a beta tester.  All that hype just for that??)<br /><br />All these points really bug me.<br /><br />However, Sphero is so endearing, I'm glad I have him.  I like to absentmindedly roll him around in the living room while I'm sitting with my husband as he's watching football.  It keeps me from getting too bored, and it's kind of relaxing.  I also like to roll him down the hall to knock on my daughter's door.  It's so cute when she says indulgently, \\"Sphero, is that you?\\"<br /><br />I'm really torn on how to rate Sphero.  The Orbotix software would get two stars.  Some of the third-party software is kind of clever, but none of the programs work that well or add much functionality, so the best of them would get maybe three stars.  However, Sphero himself works well, has excellent battery life, and seems very durable.  I'm hoping that future software will add more functionality.  But in the meantime, I can't help it, I really like my Sphero, even with his many flaws.  So I'm giving him four stars.<br /><br />UPDATE: After updating my software on 12-10-13, Sphero became mysteriously faster, which should be a good thing (especially in a wide-open area), but he also seems to have become much harder to control, even when set to a slow speed.  No other significant functionality was added with the update.  I'll have to get used to the new \\"feel\\" of Sphero, but right now, I'm thinking about dropping him down to three stars.  This last software update seems to have made him lose some of his \\"personality.\\"
B00847KFDS|3.0|Compilation records often sound great in theory:  star artist records hit songs with an all-star cast of guest artists.  And certainly the release of this album was associated with considerable buzz in view of John Fogerty's place in the rock music pantheon.  Mr. Fogerty is especially beloved by his fans, not only for the quality of his work, but for his personal integrity as well as his perseverance in the face of adversity.  Kudos to him for taking the risk of remaking these classic songs.  But like many compilations, this CD is certainly a mixed bag and many of the tracks fall flat.<br /><br />Almost all of the tracks on the album are remakes of CCR classics performed by guest artists, such as Kid Rock, Bob Seeger, and Zac Brown, accompanying John Fogerty.  There is an obvious lack of chemistry between some of the guest artists and Mr. Fogerty and a woodenness in many of the performances - not surprising in view of the fact that he doesn't have a working relationship with them.<br /><br />There are, however, some pleasant, notable exceptions such as \\"Wrote a Song for Everyone\\", with Miranda Lambert, \\"Have You Ever Seen the Rain\\", with Alan Jackson, and \\"Fortunate Son\\" with the Foo Fighters all of which are vibrant performances.  Arguably the most successful song on the album is \\"Who'll Stop the Rain\\", performed by Bob Seeger, who sings the song like he owns it.<br /><br />Adding an element of incoherence to the album is the fact that Mr. Fogerty apparently couldn't decide whether this album would be country, rock, or bluegrass, as it is a mixture of all of these.  There are influences of each in CCR's music, which the band was able to synthesize masterfully, but that did not occur on this album.  On the other hand, Mr. Fogerty incorporates bluegrass instrumentation - fiddle, mandolin, and banjo - on some of the tracks and these work beautifully.  The album might have worked better if Mr. Fogerty had simply updated these songs himself with touches such as these, much as Kris Kristofferson did successfully on his album \\"The Austin Sessions\\" as, by definition, the use of disparate guest artists pulls the album in many different directions.<br /><br />Finally, on a technical note, some of the recordings are uneven with a very muddy bass guitar sound, and excessive sibilance in the recording of Miranda Lambert's voice.
B00CVFTDKU|5.0|The finest crime drama ever, supported by the best possible cast with superior writing and direction. Went back and re-watched after the powerful ending (sorry - doubt many would see that coming, unless it was process of elimination). The idea of this being remade in America (no, FOX, no!) is laughable (see: Being Human, Torchwood). Can't wait for series 2 - happy that Olivia Colman is signed up - won't be the same with Alec Hardy!

0385537131|5.0|We’ve been treated before, in books and movies, to images of bodies hanging from a tree limb and swinging in the wind.  Most often, the dead body is the result of a lynching in a Southern state such as Mississippi or Texas and the deceased is a black man whose crime is being in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br /> In John Grisham’s latest novel, the venue is indeed Mississippi but the deceased is an old white man, Seth Hubbard, who has done the deed all by himself.  To make matters worse, he’s left a handwritten will leaving a hidden fortune to his black housekeeper, Lettie Lang.  He also disowns his two offspring and and has a few choice final words for his two ex-wives, hoping they perish in pain.  The  two big questions are:  Did Hubbard know what he was doing and Why?<br /> Grisham populates this story with a multitude of colorful characters.  By the time you’ve read the first 50 pages, you’ll be introduced to many pompous and scheming lawyers, the despicable offspring of Mr. Hubbard, Lettie Lang’s greedy relatives, and the few good people such as local attorney Jake Brigance and the crusty old magistrate, Reuben Atlee.  Jake is faced with the difficult task of representing the estate of the deceased and must argue that the terms of the will be enforced.  You’ll have no trouble at all deciding which characters you’ll love and whom to hate.<br /> The plot takes its time and covers a lot of legal ground.  We have depositions, selection of the jury, and ambush witnesses suddenly found at the last minute by unscrupulous lawyers.  Some readers may be a bit impatient with the early pace of the story but I found the legal machinations fascinating and never dull.  If nothing else, the story should give one plenty of motivation for making sure your last will and testament is done very carefully so that your surviving family members and other relevant parties are not treated to a torturous trial and exorbitant legal expenses.<br /> Did Hubbard know what he was doing?  It’s pretty much established in the affirmative right up front so I’m not giving any of the plot away.  The other question as to why he did it isn’t resolved until the end.  I thought I had it figured out but I was on the wrong track.<br /> I seldom give a book 5 stars but this one deservedly rates it.t he was doing?

B00GH4R95C|5.0|As an adult who grew up on Super Man re-runs in the 60s and the later Super Man movies I can honestly say that this film was one of the most in depth character portrayals of the story thus far.<br />Russell Crowe & Kevin Costner are outstanding as the Man of Steels fathers Jor-El and John Kent. Micheal Shannon as Gen. Zod was more that just a shallow one dementional bad guy who you actually find yourself having some degree of sympathy for.<br />And Henry Cavill does an excellent job of showing how an almost invincible being can still have moments of doubt and emotional turmoil. The flash backs to the young Clark Kent added to the development in a way I don't think any former Super Man movie has and the death of John Kent brought my family to tears. It's great for all family members. And there's nothing moms need to worry about if little ones watch.<br />For anyone who's heart has ever swelled at the thoughts and ideals of a super man, Man of Steel is a must see.
0143120530|5.0|I won't go into detail on this book and its contents - this is ably covered in many other reviews.  I'll just add my praise.  This is a well-written, very interesting book which is an extended meditation on memory: its nature, the history of human attempts to harness and improve it (including in cultures rich in oral traditions), and the various memorization techniques used by everyone from the ancients to the &#34;mental athletes&#34; who compete in memory contests today.  Foer chronicles his own journey and ultimately victorious achievements in the latter world, teaching us as he does so what his own mentors taught him: that, with the exception of very rare prodigies, most of these champions are average people with average memories that have been dramatically improved with the techniques Foer outlines.  It's a fascinating read: never dry, always compelling.  And useful... I've started using some basic memorization techniques myself, and they work - even for a guy like me who routinely forgets where he left his glasses or car keys.<br /><br />In short, a great read.

B00881VLCE|2.0|I love the puzzles, but I can't even finish a puzzle without it freezing up. It also shuts down my Kindle and it won't come back up for 5 minutes. Very frustrating!!
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|I think the story was sound and enjoyable.  It is not the best &#34;Bond&#34; story, but Craig was plausible as the character.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|cant get enough of this. just wish when they offer free power stuff you can get it without buying anything. now that its on kindel I play all the time. thanks! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000ZHCQ5U|5.0|I like to talk about and quote from this movie.  After all, what's the point if you don't tell anyone?
0979019710|5.0|I have read  The Miracle Morning this year in January and have just finished re-reading it this morning. It has changed my life so dramatically in so many positive area's. I am an MD of my own company in the health industry. For years i had been under performing and struggled with some bad habits that were affecting myself and all those around me. So something needed to change and through a PD email i receive monthly i saw link to The Miracle Morning, download the 2 free chapters and naturally bought the book. Since then i have passed my personal copy on twice, re-read it, given as gifts and had my family download it. Hal's book was my game changer!! I have increased my confindence to a level i never knew existed. I have taken a backyard business to warehousing and have a national distribution network, a new product for the industry  which i trademarked in Australia  and have filed for Canada as well as the US and am currently in the process for Health Canada approval. I must admit i have had help from others, mentors and friends but the underpinning of my success has been the discipline i have received by waking up to live the miracle morning. Side note, download the Headspace app, this has also changed my life, i incorporate it into TMM.  I recently sent the &#34;Email that will change your life&#34; and am getting  enormous value through this excersise.<br /><br />TMM has not only changed my life but many others i know.<br /><br />KM
B00BFTV09K|5.0|A really good book that is both nuanced and well written about the production and marketing of processed food and the society that craves it. Rich in information, facts and insider interviews.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Wow. That was a great book, to say the least. I was put under pressure by several of my peers to read the book before the movie and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Why? Well, the story is from the perspective of young Ender, cutting to his mentors at the beginning of every chapter. This style gives us an idea of what is going to happen and why. The beautifully crafted work is one to admire with the immense amount of imagination that goes into making any sci-fi novel, plus making it from the perspective of a small child-- even harder. The story flows well and builds up to the final chapters with much suspense. I could not put the book down. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did.
B00CEF014E|4.0|Solstice is a really good read full of action and with great pace. The plot is creative and the characters are believable. Damian Stevenson really has a talent for writing however I found parts of this very short novel felt a little rushed and there were a few holes in the plot which could have been explored more thoroughly. That said I still thoroughly enjoyed it and so have given it 4 stars. I would definately recommend this book to anybody with a couple of hours to spare.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for this game to come out for my Kindle since the game first came out. Thanks King.com! Thus is the most addictive game and now I can play it on my phone and Kindle. Twice the fun! Couldn't ask for more!! Totally recommend this game to anyone of any age. Each level has its own challenges. I never get board.
B00C50NV2M|3.0|seems like a good item...i just need to get a 3d movie screen...lolol...but it is a good buy...hope it works when my 3d screen arrives...<br /><br />I think it will do the job...
B00EUUJID6|5.0|This group is very easy to listen to. They all have such great voices  individually and together great harmony and sing in five different languages.
B00F35B8F8|3.0|Someday substance will return to moviemaking, but not today.  Live animal experimentation in a futuristic utopian society.  Yeah, that's what Star Trek was all about us getting to.
B00594XOZU|1.0|All it says in the app store is currently unavailable. I have it on my phone and it works grate.
B004TTHLBE|5.0|Engaging narrative; richly developed characters, geneologies, and histories; modern take on old gods... sounds an awful lot like what Gaiman excells at (to the nth degree!)  Who could ask for more?
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Grisham delivers his usual excitement from the beginning.  But the effect of the dramatic ending was somewhat tempered by telegraphing it early.  I don't know how he could have improved on that, however.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A true Stephen King novel, returning to the basic, but slightly believable horror that made us fall in love with his work early on.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|This is only my second gaiman and there will certainly b more. Loved the writing style and the complete disregard for normal literary order or expected sequence. Combine your dreams and reality, your wants and nightmares and u have an idea of how this book works. I loved each page.
193700788X|1.0|She really ruined this series with the last three books! I have given mine away & will never never read her books again! I wanted to throw this book across the room. She botched these beloved characters and made the last book so horrible it was like someone else rote the last three books then we don't get the whole ending as she put out the what happened after sookie book. Not going to read it! She's just putting them out ripping off her fans how dare she! So glad I never started her other series.  Caution do not waste your money!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I gave it 5 stars because it kept me totally captivated.  I could hardly wait to get to the end. Wonderful twists-- great story. BUT the end is a disappointment.  The only way I'd be able to recommend this book would be if I knew there would be a sequel. PLEASE PLEASE a sequel
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The game is very interesting. each game has different challenges. it is a great time burner when waiting for children.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|This show has opened up a non-threatening dialogue between me and my kids.  We discuss the situations and the choices made so my kids know my expectations in a non-threatening way.
B008IG5BHK|5.0|To all of the people that want true history...read a book.  Movies, and especially kids movies, have never ever followed even close to factual events, so to knock a very good kids film for factual inaccuracy does the movie itself an injustice, in my mind.<br /><br />My kids would watch this movie every day, as many times a day, as they would be allowed to.  Not completely sure what the draw is, but the movie does have a lot of entertaining scenarios, as well as the fact that Pocahontas may be their favorite Disney &#34;Princess&#34;.<br /><br />The plot is good, even though factually inaccurate, and the kids are completely enthralled with the fact that John Smith is still alive, which somehow keeps the movie good every time they watch it
B00C7GY8Y4|4.0|I do not have a lot to say about this album.  I enjoy the songs for the most aprt, but I will say that this is not an album that I listen to on repeat.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is amazing. I read through the whole series in about 4 days, and have seen all the movies. It's a great story, with great character development. And the books are 100% better than the movies. They do a pretty good job, but nothing beats the books. I would recommend this series to anyone looking for a good exciting read.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I enjoyed this book and I felt that there was a satisfying conclusion to the story, but I feel like it lacked the energy of the first two books.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|Saw this film on a plane, so I'm glad I didn't pay to see it. It was an OK way to waste a couple of hours. I fell asleep during part of it, so I can't complain about plot holes. I'll see anything with Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Mark Ruffalo - it doesn't matter if the plot makes sense or not.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Some parts didn't make sense but it is by far my favor tout of the three books from the series
B003E6LC6I|5.0|I love this show...The acting is fantastic and the story lines keep you in suspense..Glenn Close is excellent with a great supporting cast.
1476727651|5.0|Halfway through and at that point of &#34;can't wait to see where it all meets&#34;.  I am a fan of King, but I will be critical when necessary. This is a great read and the concept of going back to The Shining was a great one.
B00G8YZ48K|5.0|Absolutely love the series, but REALLY frustrated with Amazon.  My TV pass isn't working and I can't watch the latest episode!  Ahhhhhh!
B00F87ZUYG|1.0|I can't write a review of this show, because I haven't seen it. I ordered Amazon's pass for the show, which normally works okay, but for some reason it has stopped working for The Walking Dead.  I called Amazon, and they told me that the episode &#34;Live Bait&#34; was not available yet, which appears to be complete BS.  I am frustrated with Amazon lately.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game is awesome.  It is a lot of fun. It's simple, but I could play it for hours. I haven't gotten sick of it and I don't thong I will.
0553582011|3.0|I've always enjoyed his writing style but I was hoping for more closure on at least some of the plotlines.  It's a good time-killer, but I think I will jump of the endless train of character development, alteration, and destruction, and drop the series.  It's stating to read like book 3 of 20 in a harlequin romance series.  You can tell there is no end in mine.
0385351399|2.0|Disappointed in this social media pseudo-expose'. Eggers wrote a great book in &#34;A Heartbreaking Work......&#34; while The Circle is too obvious in it's plot and lack of depth in characters. Great airplane book, quick read but the ominous social media giant deserves better. I can only assume Eggers dashed this off - no excuse otherwise
B00ENTDDGW|4.0|Good and entertaining design to the game but I find a couple critiques. As you increase the difficulty setting, it seems to jump too drastically between medium and hard. I also find that you block part of the screen while trying to control the puck, and this becomes a major problem on higher difficulty levels.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|Interesting book.  Adult version of A Wrinkle in Time or The Grey King. Didn't love it and not sure I will read others.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Very good book and was so sorry this was the final one in the series.  It was hard to put down, once begun.
B00G70J81O|5.0|I liked the movie. Was it a classic? No, but it was a lot of fun and Hugh Jackman was born to play this role. The story is fun and we get some extra action and cursing in this version but not a whole lot of extra footage. This is a much better film the the Origin story they did a few years ago and if you are a fan of the X-Men or comic book super hero movies in general you will like this film.
B00FEHXISA|3.0|Not too bad but I wouldn't buy a copy for my library. I may not even watch a sequel to this. I'm not sure if it's the character I don't like or Robert himself that I'm tired off or it could be the plot or whatever. It just didn't click anymore. The first one was very good, the second was good, but this one is just OK.
B003OUXECE|4.0|Puts a lot of detail unto the first game. You will play the game after and recognize all the names in the recordings
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Great plot and characters were played well. It's one of those few stories with a lot of twists especially at the end. I wouldn't even give a clue for anybody who wants to watch this because that would kill the plot. Just watch it and enjoy.
B009WUBERW|3.0|Okay for the cameo appearances in the movie, and they appear just at the right time,kind of funny in that aspect.
B00E6X4GAW|5.0|This is an extraordinary account of a brave young girl living in a part of Pakistan that she clearly loves so much despite the hostility of the Taliban towards women, girls and education. It gave me a tremendous insight into the difficulties faced by all females in her country.<br /><br />The contrast she narrates between life in the Swat Valley and Birmingham is enlightening and fascinating.
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|The whole movie was in one building, it would be better if it was more related to the city as a whole, but it was still okay.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Problem is the lack of software support on the Kindle for the mappings.  Even the static maps didn't work well during the storms we had over the weekend.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|Awesome frequency and dynamic range for someone looking for a good quality bargain!  They are also extremely sleek and stylish.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|One of his Best!  Love all the songs on this CD.  Have also bought this for friends & family as a gift.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The plot was interesting, held my attention and was very thought provoking. I have also read the previous books by the same author which I found a bit more exciting, but I am glad I read this one.
B00D48BT5A|4.0|Good read for people who like the gossip and background surrounding people and events.<br />I found my mind wandering a bit sometimes with to much detail.<br />But it is very interesting, crazy how many people died trying to fly from USA to other places.
B00GFOIUVQ|3.0|It takes to long to load but the graphics are awesome. You can download it but check out the reviews
B0012QRPU4|3.0|It's just a synopsis of the show. It tells you about who these characters are. It was nice to see the writer of the show.
B004K8WJ3Y|4.0|In 2008, England's Whitesnake made a surprising move: Returning with \\"Good To Be Bad,\\" their first album of new material in eleven years. Now, fast forward three years, and the band is heard even finer toning their already good pop metal/glam metal/hard rock sound, the same sound that they helped to invent all of the way back in 1978. Indeed, despite featuring a new rhythm section (as Michael Devin and Brian Tichy replace Uriah Duffy and Chris Frazier on bass and drums, respectively), 2011's \\"Forevermore\\" could not be more vintage Whitesnake.<br /><br />There are a handful of obligatorily docile ballads to be had on this fine album (see the bloated and open-sounding \\"Easier Said Than Done,\\" \\"One Of These Days,\\" and \\"Fare Thee Well\\"), as there are a sizeable amount of radio-ready hit-singles (i.e. \\"Love Will Set You Free,\\" et al). But no matter what the intensities of the songs, one thing always remains constant: Infectious catchiness. Indeed, this band clearly know their way around a great hook, and this fact is greatly showcased pretty much all throughout this set's sixty-three-minute playing time. And when this is coupled with the band's decent songwriting and exceptional musicianship, the end result is one pretty darn solid release.<br /><br />And the record's use of balladry and commercially-accessible material, its most memorable moments are its heaviest and most metallic. Opener \\"Steal Your Heart Away,\\" with its up-tempo pacing, groovy, hard rocking guitar line, and distinctly AC-DC-indebted vibe, would make for an excellent party song. It is also highlighted by an assortment of Aerosmith-ian slide guitar runs and even a country/bluegrass-flavored harmonica solo. And it is followed up by \\"All Out Of Luck,\\" which is an even heavier tune, and boasts a really memorable, groovy main riff, and some nicely melodic soloing (including one particularly guitar-able solo near the end). And this number might also have a killer chorus, but is actually most remarkable on account of it featuring an excellent instrumental break/bridge that allows the guitarists to truly show off their ample skill.<br /><br />\\"Tell Me How,\\" a hard rocking, stadium-sized anthem that boasts some unforgettable, wah-wah/whammy bar tinged guitar leads; the bluesy acoustic balladry of \\"One Of These Days\\"; and \\"Love And Treat Me Right,\\" which is another infectious and feel-good hard rocker with impressive solo flights, are three pieces of further standouts. But it is actually \\"Dogs In The Street\\" that takes the cake for having the best and lengthiest guitar soloing on this whole record, as it is filled with dazzling leads. And what epic, wailing, long, winding, and air-guitar-worthy soloing it is, too. And \\"Forevermore\\"'s two final highlights are \\"Whippy Boy Blues,\\" which is a hard-rockin' good time filled with not one, but two positively terrific guitar solos; and the closing \\"My Evil Ways,\\" which is complete with a thundering drum intro, unforgettably epic choruses, and more excellent, pyrotechnic soloing.<br /><br />Not only is \\"Forevermore\\" an indisputably successful album that is as contagious as it is as high-quality as it is highly contagious, it is also one of the best pieces of hard rock/traditional metal to surface in all of the year 2011. And not only that, but this reviewer might also venture to say that it is  one of the genre's finest releases of the decade so far, too.count of it featuring an excellent instrumental break/bridge that allows the guitarists to truly show off their ample skill.<br /><br />\\"Tell Me How,\\" a hard rocking, stadium-sized anthem that boasts some unforgettable, wah-wah/whammy bar tinged guitar leads; the bluesy acoustic balladry of \\"One Of These Days\\"; and \\"Love And Treat Me Right,\\" which is another infectious and feel-good hard rocker with impressive solo flights, are three pieces of further standouts.

B005LAIIN0|4.0|Very entertaining! Insight into the 'what would I do if it were me?' Question. Saw it in the movies came home and reserved it ASAP.
B00B7364H2|5.0|A true bargain for anyone looking for a great collection of classical music recorded to the highest standards. At about $2 per CD it doesn't get much better than this.
B005H9B44A|5.0|Another Marvel home run. Fun and action packed. I love how Marvel has connected all these movies. Can't wait to Phase 2 movies.
B00GH4R95C|4.0|Entertaining movie. I liked that they created more background to the story. It was a little cartoonish during the fight scenes, but overall, very entertaining!
B007MU85D0|5.0|This album is one of my favorites. I have listened to it so many times, and I seem to never get tired of it! It is so diverse in sound and depth that I feel that I hear something different in the album every time. It also has an interesting combination of being fast enough to run to, but yet slow enough to listen to in the background as you work. I highly recommend it!
0330447920|4.0|This is an OK book to read as Wilbur Smith is one of the best authors in the world and his best books are &#34;Train From Katanga&#34; (&#34;Dark Of The Sun&#34;) and &#34;Eagle In The Sky.&#34;
B00GH4R95C|5.0|IMHO the Amazon video service is more reliable than Comcast's On Demand video and the resolution seemed better too (Need fast internet for this).  The first movie I have watched on this was Man Of Steel and I was blown away by the subtleties of the lighting and atmospheres the visual effects provided. I also liked Amy Adams as a hot Lois Lane.  Zack Snyder never makes a bad movie!  Of course neither does Christopher Nolan who worked on this too. Mix in their wives working on this and you got a 5 star AAA flick! I liked this movie so much that I purchased the Blu-ray the next day after watching it on Amazon instant video.  My only regret is having not seen it in theaters.
B004AUGJS8|3.0|A sunny romance twists and turns into a dark, albeit suspenseful (because of the music cues and dramatic camera angles), tale of a sociopath's fall from grace and mental stability. Kirsten Dunst was absolutely wonderful, but Ryan Gosling's acting was wooden and lacked warmth, even in the parts where he should have been believably romantic. The huggy movie poster fooled me into watching this. I kept waiting for the movie to snap out of it and give me what I wanted as a viewer: satisfaction.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|This game is a little fun but it gets boring after a while... I kinda like it I'm gonna give it a few days
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Engaging and entertaining read.  Suspenceful pace with vivid characters and integrated subplots. Once you get started reading, it's hard to put down.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's useful to have. No problems so far with this application. Needed it for basic math I can't solve in my heard. :)
B002UWH8P6|3.0|It started out very well, but became cliche very soon.  Looking for thoughts on what the past and future would look like. Why did the Ancients have a ship sent to collect human specimens.  Personality development over took the mission, which could have been done in a locked room.  A ship sent by my Ancient Grandfather would have been able to protect itself and its contents.  And traveling faster than the speed of light would get you to the Ancients before they were able to develop that space craft.  The Ancient's civilization would be 14 billion years past the second galaxy on the right and straight on til morning.<br /><br />If you went to the edge of the Universe, would you be able to go beyond it or because all matter and energy is of this Universe, you could not go beyond the boundary.
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|This is one of my favorite ever movies. The story is beautifully paced, well written, perfectly developed. Be warned, however, that this is not a typical film. If your taste runs a little left of center, this is a film for you!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I've been a reader of Stephen King's books since the mid-70's, beginning with &#34;Salem's Lot.&#34;  My adult son, who recommended &#34;Dr. Sleep,&#34; wasn't even born when &#34;The Shining&#34; was written.  It was great revisiting Dan Torrance grown up, as well as meeting new characters.  I don't know if anyone else has this reaction, but Stephen King's writing for me is sometimes like the best/scariest amusement park ride, scared out of my wits...then laughing!  (&#34;Great party isn't it?&#34;  &#34;Give us a kiss dear.&#34;) Stephen King is indeed the master storyteller!
0553386794|5.0|I picked up this series after hearing how much people enjoyed the TV series on HBO. It has been a LONG time since I have found a book (or series) that captures my attention as this first book in the series did. The writing is amazingly rich, and the character development is excellent. It was nearly impossible for me to put this book down until it was finished. The conclusion to the first book was incredible, and I was glad I planned ahead enough to buy the second book before finishing the first. I wasted no time continuing the story in the second book.<br /><br />This book is amazing.
B009CF3MEK|5.0|I have not yet seen the 2012 version, and I wanted to see this 1974 version first, especially since I am a fan of Robert Redford. This was an excellent production, and I would watch it again. Great acting and supporting cast.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|Month and months later i still love this cd. Great easy listen no need to skip tracks. I like to have it on at work.
0316055433|5.0|The Goldfinch is unlike any other book I've read. I read it slowly, savoring it and, at times, rereading entire chapters. I did this for two reasons; one being that it was so beautifully written that I wanted to take it in again. The other, because I wasn't always certain of what the point was. I would step away from the book, thinking, &#34;What's the relevance, the significance of what I just read?&#34;, only to have it twist around, spinning and evolving and taking shape in the back of my mind, the centrifuge making sense only when seen from a distance. Even now, it stays with me, heavy and palpable.<br />I won't bother giving a summary of the plot (I think that's better left to dust jackets and website summaries). I'll just say this in closing: I don't think I'll ever read this novel again, but that's okay. It's a part of me now
0785153942|4.0|I must confess I'm not really into comic books, but I really like the movie Pacific Rim, so I added this to my blu-ray purchase. I'm not regret at all. It's a very elegant book, with awesome design, and it's a great inside to the unknown part of the story. The only thing... I wish it was longer, and I wish there was more of them.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I purchased the game and have not stopped playing for two hours very addicting game. So far no in game purchases required.
B008JFUR10|5.0|Very good edition. If you loved the movie is a MUST have. The extras are pretty nice, but what I loved the most was the audio commentary by Guillermo del Toro. If you are a mecha fan, you will love listen to him.
0684847817|5.0|Wonderful book!  Brian Froud's artwork is gorgeous!  The cover & pages to this book are nice & thick.  Binding is tight.
B007PVHMCG|2.0|To small for the price. The idea is great, but my son loose interest as soon it was put together. This piece should cost no more than $15.
B00BEIYMTW|2.0|This movie would have been good as the visuals were excellent and some of the action was fun to watch, however, the shameless similarities to Cars and the original story line where too much to bear. We have the down and out hero who has to fight to win, the old grumpy character that makes him turn around and be better, the female interest and even the foe are similar characters to Cars. They did nothing original here at all to set this apart from Cars. They didn't even try to do anything different which leads me to believe Disney is nothing without Pixar when these types of films are created. I sat there watching it just waiting for it to &#34;take off&#34; (pun intended). It started out too slow and never really got that exciting. If I never saw Cars it might have been a good film but there are too many retreads of other movies out there and this is yet another one. There are much better animated films with more original storylines. I have watched Cars a dozen times with the kids and would easily sit through it again and again before wasting time watching this even a second time. It gets 2 stars because of the visuals but 1 for the story.
B0002KPIQY|5.0|Based on a true story of the super model Gia. It depicts her crazy, drug fueled journey to fame, then her fast fall to a horrible end
B005LAIIN0|4.0|This is a really good Zombie film with a more original approach. Brad Pitt is fantastic as always. I watched the unrated version only so I am not sure how the theatrical version is in comparison. From what I have read, the unrated version extends the violence scenes and up's the gore factor which is what you want to see in a Zombie flick. I wasn't thrilled with the PG-13 rating this got in theaters but I really wanted to see it as it looked interesting. Then they released the unrated version.... Overall a very good film.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It's. Amazing worth the money and makes you want to read more..I love it<br /> She keeps you.on the edge of your seat
B0062NAVXA|4.0|We need to know the stories of our current service personnel and what they have done for us.  I served and know the cost of serving, but Freedom isn't really free.
140006922X|5.0|An interesting read for a &#34;born again&#34; believer, an agnostic, an atheist, a Jew (or other persons of any other belief that the &#34;true believers&#34; of Jesus would find heretical). Although I have read other books about Jesus and the place and time in which he lived, I learned new things in this book. I think this is a must read for anyone in our culture because Jesus (and &#34;God&#34;) are made so much a part of it - like it or not, or believe it or not. It is easy to see why, with all the “messiahs” of Jesus' time that the Jews did not hone in on him as their true messiah.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|We owe it to ourselves and our fellow Americans to know about the Founding Fathers and what kind of men they were and why they had such skills to write our American Charter papers.
0062255657|5.0|Neil Gaiman has this wonderful way of writing that sucks you in and makes you feel everything going on in the story.  He can throw shocking things in there and you just accept it and enjoy the story.  He can somehow take and normal every day person like a little boy and put him in such a strange and difficult situation and make it so believable even though it isn't possible in the least.  This story made me say, &#34;WHAT!&#34; and then laugh and sigh and then hide under the blanket. So if you want to think and ponder and be entertained.  I recommend this book.
B000I5XOVY|5.0|Swordfish is a well written movie with lots of action and explosions.  It is a great movie to watch on Blu Ray to test your home theater system.  I bought this movie to test out my new home theater system and I must say it was a good choice.<br /><br />Oh and Holly Berry is pretty easy on the eyes.
006202406X|5.0|So this is not your typical ending of a series.  In fact, I normally would not have a nice thing to say about a series that ends like this one does, but I have to say that even though I cried buckets, I loved the series and recommend it to anyone who loves dystopian stories.  The characters stay true to themselves through out the story and still grow and progress and learn.  The things they went through really made me think and consider what I would do in the same situation.  Still I wish it could have ended differently and if I had been writing it I may not have had the guts to write the things that Veronica chose to write.
B00B2JSRAS|1.0|This is pure fantasy. The author is a quack and a hack engaging in magical thinking for materialistic gain. It is hard to fathom that people buy into this in this day and age. If you believe in The Secret, then maybe this is for you. However, if you prefer living in reality, you may want to skip this title. The premise of the book is that God/The Universe/Whatever should and will submit to the will of your ego.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|l really think this game is addicting. the music is awesome and trippy and as you achieve each level its a sense of accomplishment. I highly recommend this game to people that like puzzle games.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Meh......... Ok if you only really want to do netflix and YouTube  I'm sure it will get better once google developes more apps
B00EVW0SA0|1.0|Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx (hereafter referred to as Fauxxbama) star in Roland Emmerich's mashup of Triumph of the Will and Die Hard.<br /><br />Sony lost 200 million on this bomb. Good. Isn't making a action/propaganda movie for liberals a bit like cooking a steak for a vegetarian?<br /><br />The quips were not funny at all. Every. Single. Character, from Fauxxbama to the little girl was annoying as a chalkboard scratch. The movie then sets about insulting every American left.<br /><br />The special effects, however, were quite excellent.<br /><br />The movie ends, after the desolation of the White House, with the entire Arab world wanting to sit down and talk about peace. Why? Because the capitol building was burning and the White House was destroyed? Shoot, if that's all it takes, lets do it tomorrow!<br /><br />Olympus has Fallen was a weak movie, but still far better than this insulting piece of trash. It makes me wonder if the funding Roland Emmerich got for this movie was from Iran. Seriously.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Well, of course, I hate that Matthew has been injured.  What a surprising bummer.  Can't wait to see Season 4 in January.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Thank you Marcus, Danny, Mikey, and Axe for everything you gave. And to everyone that lost their lives. If I didn't see the movie trailer, I would have never have known about the book. You did an excellent job writing this account of your mission. After reading this you actually encouraged me to REENLIST into the navy reserves medical program. Thank you for everything Marcus.
B0058PJ6NE|1.0|I started having problems with my Kindle Fire Hd. I ran a virus program and it stated that this program had a virus. The virus program took it out and all works fine now
B008Y6XUTU|4.0|Nicholson and Keaton are great. The story and dialogue are creative.  It is funny and endearing. I have watched the movie 3 or 4 times.
B000I543T6|5.0|What can I say.  Al Pacino was at his best in this movie.  So was Mannie.  This movie is a must have for gangster movie collectors.
B003B02OOG|5.0|This was great reading.  John Grisham did a great job of giving the reader insight into the lives and culture of people living in Mississippi.
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|Watched &#34;The Croods&#34; with my granddaughter and we both enjoyed it. Nice fast-paced movie with a good message. She had sen it at the theater when it first came out but wanted to watch it again, which says it all.
0375831002|5.0|I love an author that can transport me to another time and place.  I actually listened to this book on Audible and was fascinated by the way the narrator told the story!!  Excellent Book!!
B005HEVBGG|5.0|Great series.  I somehow missed this durin the 90s, but watch TNG regularly.  So this is a delight to go back and watch for the first time.
1401907725|5.0|Beautiful messages, art work & quality cards; It is amazing how powerfully they respond to my questions & hearts desires.
B000HL09MG|2.0|a bit too confusing for my taste.  i like movies that you have to follow and keep track. plus i didnt feel  the  personalities of characters were described enough for me to really care what happened to them.
B004XCM89M|1.0|The format of this Blu-ray is for area B and even my blu ray multiplayer could not read it. I don't understand why Blu-ray are not region free!
B000TEUSJK|5.0|A little off from history, but that is holly wood for ya! other then that it was good. happy ness to you!
1476712042|4.0|I honestly loved this book! It was effortlessly written and intriguing. I had to fight myself to put it down. However, I find the character of Abby kind of annoying at times, she irritates me and she's sometimes irrational and selfish. But I guess that's part of her characterization. I actually think the sequel (this story told from Travis's POV) is way better. Anyway, I really recommend it because it's a lovely read and gets to the heart of love.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Very good tale, different type of story line and interesting characters.  The book didn't drag at all, held my interest throughout.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|My husband travels a lot and its great to know how he should pack.  I also appreciate being able to check the forecasts.  The web site is easy to navigate and I'm on it at least five times a week.
B009R659L8|5.0|I'm almost finished and can hardly wait to learn what happens.  I love all MHClark's books.  They are always a quick read as they are hard to put down.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|it is the best game ever u get a lot of money in no time it is the best hunting game please get it everyone.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This book kept me on my toes and guessing until the end.  Loved everything about it. The ending was not what I wanted but fit the book.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Wow!  Grisham weaves a wonderful tale and follows the reality of life in the South!  As educational as it is a good read.
B0038LB4TE|2.0|I don't like reading about Reacher in the first person, I prefer the books when they are written about Reacher, not through his own words.
6304498969|3.0|As much as I love this CD, which I listen to frequently, I have to say that the DVD is something of a disappointment. It's just a little too static and dry. Also, my impression is that Clapton has never been the most compelling performer to watch anyway. He's too \\"inward\\" and doesn't project himself on stage. I think he views himself as a performer whose job it is to deliver the goods as well as he can, and leaves the stage antics to people like Ted Nugent. Typically, EC doesn't even look at the audience and rarely acknowledges their presence with more than the obligatory \\"Thank you\\". Okay, it's not thrilling stuff to watch but it's great to listen to.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|my lives keep disappearing, I love this game but every time I get lives saved up they disappear :( if anyone can help me understand.
0792833260|5.0|Amazing movie! One of my favorites of all times. Have watched it several times and ended up buying it. Will probably watch it again some day.
193700788X|3.0|I couldn't believe the ending..I was actually very disappointed by this book as I had high hopes for it that it didn't meet at all.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|He's young and new out here. Has his own style which is very refreshing.  I play it often in my studio.  The music moves you.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Exciting from start to finish.  I want John Grisham to write more novels.  I'm reading them faster than he's writing them. :(
B007MB5OCE|5.0|THE BOOK IS QUIRKY AND I LOVE THE UNUSUAL CHARACTERS IN THE BOOK.  THE PATH THE VARIOUS CHARACTERS TAKE IS AMAZING AND AMUSING.  VERY ENJOYABLE READING!
B00338QENI|5.0|Excellent book.  Very informative.  I found it hard to put the book down. It is amazing to realize all that she (unknowingly) contributed to science.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|I enjoyed the book very much, and I didn't want it to end. Now I am going to watch the movie.
B00ESY77LO|3.0|Kind of a strange movie (rap music playing at the parties, really?).  I rented to watch with a friend who wanted to see it.  Glad I did not purchase it to own!  Would not watch it again.
0810970686|5.0|My 7-year-old boy can't get enough of this series (and his dad likes it, too). Cute books, definitely worth trying.
B000CEAGH6|5.0|My daughter loves loves loves velociraptors and was super excited to receive this.  A with all the Schleich products we have purchased, the quality is great even with little brother's rough play (when he tries to defer the dinosaurs of course!)
B000URWYTS|5.0|I bought this book knowing very little about Frank Lloyd Wright and nothing about Mamah Cheney. Now I want to know everything about them. A century ago an affair between 2 married people was absolutely scandalous and nearly ruined a famous architect's career. Today it would earn free publicity. Although some parts of the book were slow-moving the story was intriguing. I had a tough time putting it down. The ending was rather shocking. I can't wait to research the lives of these two fascinating people. I will definitely read this author again.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Reality, futuristic, and skating the edges of science fiction are words and terms for this thrilling story.  There seemed to be some gaps between events leaving the reader wondering what they missed but it wasn't difficult to pick up the thread.  Overall a very entertaining book.
B00DW39B2K|2.0|Not one of the better DeNiro movies. A little slow, no edge to eat, didn't have me on the edge of my seat or biting my nails. It was just okay.
B00B0LPYXG|2.0|This movie dragged on way too long and didn't have anything compelling to carry it. I would not recommend it.
B002XISR8E|1.0|This product was sent to an address in the USA, which was not playable in the USA. It was playable only in a region which included Afica and Europe. Why would I be sent a DVD playable only in that region, when it was ordered and delivered to a location in the USA. I bummed. They refunded my money with no explanation, I would rather have a playable DVD .
B008TMA1LY|3.0|I really enjoy this game as a time passer, however it's slightly aggravating that when you get to a certain point you cannot get any further without paying actual money for some new characters. It would be a lot better if everything just ran from coins acquired within the game rather than actual money.
B006IYG5HE|4.0|Detective Hole is a loner but a big, tough, scary, and blessed with a great sense of humor. Plot is developed by chapter flashbacks to 1944 and a group of Norwegians participants on the eastern front but on whose side?  I read this book on a recommendation here that Mr Nesbo was in league with Steig Larsson and among the best Scandinavian authors.  I certainly agree. Now if someone could write a series using Nesbo' detective Hole and Larsson's Lisbeth Salander - what a great read
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|A little disappointed that  to get the additional game I need to critique the game just played. I like to play without feeling I need go grade it. I retired from teaching to get away from that.
B003H4I4JU|3.0|Speaker for the Dead takes a completely different path from Ender's Game, diving into spirituality and emotional conflicts. I was expecting to find MORE about the war with the Formics or the advancement of mankind towards the stars, but the book makes an effort not to touch those themes. However, the story is interesting, even though some concepts like a &#34;faster than light conscience&#34; are hard to believe. At the end I was happy to have read it but completely lost interest in the rest of the series.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|Not what I expected...Was hoping for another masterpiece like his previous solo album The View From The Hill back in 1996. However, time has altered my original impressions a bit, and I thought in all fairness I should amend my original comments - and criticisms.  I love the first five tracks, especially track 5, On the Road To Love&#34;, co-written with Kenny Loggins. It's a great catchy tune with a country flair that reminds me a bit of the Moodies hit Your Wildest Dreams. This is some of Hayward's finest solo material. From there on out though, he switches gears and the album takes a decidedly bluegrass twist, even incorporating two tracks from Moody Bluegrass 2...Much Love, and a new single, What You Resist Persists. The album closes with a TECHNO version of the Moody Blues single I Know You're Out There Somewhere, here titled Out There Somewhere, followed by, in my opinion, a dreadful Raul Rincon remix. This foray into techno, to me, is hard to swallow.  I wish there was more Moodies-sounding material here. To me this mix of three musical genres just doesn't work. I really do appreciate Hayward's respect and admiration for American country and bluegrass music though, but I hope he doesn't try techno again. Younger fans will probably like it but I want to hear something that sounds like the front man of the Moody Blues. I give 5 stars to the album anyway, in spite of the aforementioned comments.  I hope that when the Moodies celebrate 50 years together next year that they will reunite for an album along with founding members Mike Pinder and Ray Thomas. They were on Moody Bluegrass 2, so maybe there's hope. We're just the singers in a rock n' roll band.
0061950726|3.0|Like several other books;  the ending I did not like because I felt that more  time needed to be spent on new characters.
B0002IQHY8|4.0|A lot of AP fans seem to hate this album. Its not bad at all - its just not like his other ones, and doesn't sound like them either. But if you just listen to it as it is I think you will come to like it.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I was so disappointed with how my Kindle was working.  I knew I needed to clean up its act, but could not figure out how to do it.  I was trying everything I knew how to do.  Then I received an ad about this &quot;cleaner&quot; and I used it.  Hooray I love my Kindle again.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|I'll say it again - An incredibly beautiful album for any time of year. One of the very best winter themed albums ever done.
B00000DQSZ|5.0|Product met my expectations, the music sounded better than the original recordings. I'd been trying to find these artists for some time . My quest is finally over!
B00G9U7NEQ|3.0|not as funny as the 1st one. several chuckles, small smiles. Seemed kinda forced. Also,the story of how Randall became bad was not really in the movie. He comes in as a scared kids and joins the bullying, brash top-scarer club.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game! I wish I had started playing sooner. Now I'm making up for lost time! Great game, graphics! TOO MUCH FUN!
1594744475|5.0|Well written, with recipes for some traditional bento foods, an extensive resource on where to purchase bento producs, and some really cute ideas on making lunch cute!
B002BU0DPE|2.0|The volume changing capabilities are great, and I love the overly movable mic. The only problem is the headphones start to hurt my ears, due to bad padding, after only ten minutes.
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|The movie took forever to get going.  It was, I think to long for my kids to sit through.  I thought the acting was good though!
B00G4I1CLS|5.0|This movie was absolutely informative, it captured my interest entirely, and the truth was bold and clear. I cried during this movie, it broke my heart. I hope it made others realize the horrors of captive orca whales. &#34;Blackfish&#34; did an excellent job spreading the word about Seaworld's horrible industry.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Excellent. I was disappointed when I reached the end. Two great characters. Great mysteries. Moral themes. Approaching apocalypse. Highly recommend. Rivals Game of Thrones.
B00G32OER4|4.0|Chilling, realistic, and very graphic. Beautiful setting, and good essence of the 60's vibe. I just didn't really like the negativity and slander towards witches. It was very incorrect in that aspect.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|One of the best Christmas movies ever!!! Funny, yet wholesome. Great story telling without shock value. A MUST for the Christmas Season
B00BAXFECK|5.0|This book is so well crafted and characterized, it sucks you in. I was afraid the terrorism part of the plot would be lurid and overblown, but it completely incidental to the real story. The portrayal of unthinking resilience in the main character is right on.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham never disappoints.  While a fictional story, I'm sure there's an element of truth.  It gives the reader a perspective of the ugly truth of our history.  Loved it!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This device is totally AMAZING! The set up was easier than expected (and I expect a lot from Google). Within 5 minutes of plugging the device into my TV, we were up and running and watching a show on Netflix. The picture was much better than the same show being played thru my BlueRay device. I am gobsmacked. I'm now closer to &#34;slinging&#34; all my shows from my devices (iPad, iPhone, Nexis 7, and various laptops). Shortly I will be able to cancel my AT&T Uverse account! (And, I'll be saving over a thousand dollars a year.) For the money, this device is well worth the price!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is the best game ever in the whole world I am  stuck on 23 but my dad is on 377 wow
B008M87GJK|5.0|Very quick and easy to set up different categories of stories and browse each category in film strip style rows. Impressively quick to load each story.  A delight to use.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This is such a fun game and i love the relaxing music also. I am addicted to this game now and I don't want to put it down. I like that you are actually able to advance without spending a ton of money to play this game too.
B00756GRUE|5.0|The calendar is impossible to read. All of the other items on the watch were just what my husband wanted.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I honestly didnt expect the book to be as good as it was. I enjoyed it a lot and cant wait to see the movie hoping it doesnt ruin too much. But i strongly recommend it to everyone especially teens that can somewhat relate
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Totes love it. It's consuming me from the inside out. I have spent a good many hours immersed, and I love it. So good!
B00A757EFW|4.0|Its so fun. &#34;Ok, i just got to eat all the pellets. Uh oh! Its a ghost! Theres another ghost! Im cornered!!!!! No don't eat me!&#34; Then he dies.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Super fun game for Kindle. My son likes to upgrade the guns with features and we challenge each other on who can make the most kills. Fun and challenging. No issues so far!
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Its stupid. You cant swipe anything. How are you supposed to win. Dont waste your money. Even though its free
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Could use a little more realistic help. Like regrowing trees that got chopped down. But I do like it. Yay :)
B007VDN1PA|4.0|So far it seems to do exactly what it said it would do.  I have lots of old slides and with a digital card and this scanner, I can save the slides onto the card and then show them on the computer instead of having to get the slide projector out.  It will also allow less space to store the images as well.  I haven't tried the negatives yet but will get to those as a winter project.<br /><br />Mary
B00AKKTDJY|1.0|Doesn't work on Kindle Fire. Game is messed up don't buy. EVER. you are making a horrible mistake if you are buying it if you have a Kindle fire.
B00FXMECS6|4.0|They kept the film close to the first one, a few twists and turns kept the film moving... and funny.
B0030B624E|3.0|Some comedy, the 4 main actors keep the movie from being horrible.  They carry the movie and keep it from being unwatchable.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|It is a good action move. Captain Kirk is always charging into action with, Spock and the Enterprise's outstanding crew backing him up. One has to lesson to the dialogue there are some great one liners said by all the crew members.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Great movie! I hope that all parties involved in agruculture take time to watch it and note what a wonderful asset Temple Grandin was to the Beef Industry!
B00F35BV64|2.0|By the title alone, this review may come across as immature or juvenile.  Yet despite my best efforts, I can't come up with a better description for this movie.  It's incoherent, poorly written and nonsensical.  It also apparently contains some sort of subliminal brain washing hidden in all of Abram's lens flares that cause people to enjoy it, because when I explain my reasons for disliking this movie I hear a lot of, &#34;it's just a good, fun movie!  It's got good action and it's Star Trek!  Don't over-analyze it!  JJ ABRAMS IS THE BEST DIRECTOR EVER.  ALL HAIL ABRAMS.&#34;  Sorry, I just can't agree to any of this and I refuse to jump on the Into Darkness bandwagon.  Okay, let's get into some details.  And as a disclaimer, I will NOT be able to keep this spoiler free.  You've been warned and what-have-you.<br /><br />The 2009 Star Trek reboot wasn't the best science fiction movie ever, nor the best Star Trek movie, but it was really fun and if you overlooked the flaws (which weren't nearly as numerous as they are in this followup) it really was quite enjoyable.  One of the best sequences in that movie, if not THE best, was the introductory scene.  It was intense, it evoked emotion and it was a great action sequence.  I had no doubt that I was watching a Star Trek movie.  The intro scene to Into Darkness was none of the above.  It was goofy, pointless and made no sense.  I understand it laid the groundwork for the whole &#34;we're supposed to be friends, Spock!&#34; plot point, but there are better ways that could have been done.  The biggest flaw with that sequence... why was the Enterprise under water?? Why wasn't it in orbit where it belonged?  The pasty black-eyed natives wouldn't have seen it there.  The entire reason they put it there was to have the scene where it rises up with water falling off of it.  But why do we NEED that scene?  It's a space ship!  We already got the Enterprise rising up through Saturn's Ring in the last movie, and that scene looked cool and made more sense.  This intro only laid the ground work for how little sense the rest of this movie makes.<br /><br />So next we're introduced to the movie's villain (or merely one of them, as we later find out).  And he's mysterious and borderline interesting and made cooler by the fact that he's played by Benedict Cumberbach.  But wait... how does he convince the star fleet officer to blow up a building and kill hundreds of his peers AFTER he saved the life of said officer's daughter?  What kind of monster would kill hundreds of people for his child in the first place, let alone AFTER their child was already saved?  Couldn't he have at least TRIED to contact a superior officer?  &#34;Hey boss, I think some dude has it out for us, because he wants me to blow everyone up.&#34;  No.  He's just a sheep and does what the bad guy wants.<br /><br />Okay, I'll just cut the &#34;bad guy&#34; crap and say it.  It's Khan.  KHAAAAAAAAN! You know, the villain in one of the most iconic Star Trek films that already came out 30 years ago?  Yes apparently we need him as a villain again, because someone thought that giving this movie its own identity was a bad idea.  Not surprising since Abrams doesn't seem to have an original bone in his body.  Except this time Khan is a white gentleman, presumably English. But the character is Indian.  Okay... Well, as long as they give him good motive and make him an interesting character, that's forgivable right? WRONG.  The original Khan was a such a good villain in Wrath because he and the Enterprise crew had a history. He had a true REASON to hate Kirk.  This Khan's weight as a villain in this continuity is baseless.  He's apparently a puppet to a corrupt Starfleet admiral who found him randomly, suspended for 300 years in the vacuum of space, and wants to use him to build a star ship with modern technology. *record abruptly stops.*  What???  Admiral Marcus is going to use the 300 year old man to develop technology that exceeds current tech?  Who thought of this during the writing process?  It makes no sense.<br /><br />That brings me to yet another item in the stream of things that make no sense: Admiral Marcus.  At first I really liked the idea of the Starfleet Admiral trying to beef up Star Fleet into a force to be reckoned with against the Klingons.  The plot of the movie should have been based around THIS.  I have a feeling it originally was and some producer put his hand in the cookie jar and said &#34;okay, this is good but we need Khan in it.  People won't watch it unless Khan is there.&#34;  It seemed like Marcus was pulling the whole &#34;the needs of the few outweigh the needs of the many&#34; schtick, letting one crew take the wrap for a mess that would lead to Starfleet needing a greater military presence.  But then I thought, &#34;wait, why is this even necessary?  Doesn't the Federation have the foresight to know that they're surrounded by potential enemies everywhere and that they already NEED a strong military presence?  Didn't Nero's super-ship prove that a few years before?  There shouldn't need to be a stupid evil plot to sacrifice the most celebrated ship in the fleet and all of it's crew to make it happen.  And why is Marcus so evil?  Why wouldn't he care that he's killing a ship with a crew of hundreds on it?  This is just bad writing.  A villain without a purpose, evil for evil's sake.  This isn't Disney and we should expect more.<br /><br />You'd think the good guys, the crew of the Enterprise, would be the one shining spot in this movie, the one redeeming factor.  This is ALMOST the case, except that the 2009 movie handled the crew much better.  Here, Kirk isn't so much clever as a fumbling, lucky idiot (though I still do enjoy Pine as the casting choice.) I had enough of self-doubting, boyfriend Spock in the first movie, I didn't need more of him here.  Ohura is nothing but a nagging girlfriend.  Clearly there could have been SOMETHING more useful to do with her character.  Urban as Bones is still enjoyable, I don't have too much negative to say about him.  The roles that the rest of the crew had were easily forgettable, even the wonderful Simon Pegg couldn't hold this crew together.<br /><br />I could keep going... (why did Khan put his people in torpedoes, of all things?? Why did they have to ask future Spock for help? Isn't that cheating?) but this is going long enough.  If the movie weren't so pretty to look at, I wouldn't have given it the extra star.  As it is, that was the only enjoyable thing about it for me.  I really hope that Abrams will be too busy with Star Wars to get his hands into the next one.  Perhaps with a better director and a better script for #3 (if there will be a #3) I can forget that this mess even happened.  May this franchise live-long and prosper under more capable hands in the future.
B003FAJTOA|4.0|I enjoyed the story, the casting, the huge number of properly outfitted extras, and the elaborate costuming of the principle characters.  The film was a bit long, and the subtitles' made the film sometimes tedious to view, but overall I enjoyed a glimpse into the past of the Japanese culture.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|A hoot all the way through.  &#34;It's so fluffy!!&#34;  An Addams Family for the current age.  Look for the edition which includes the Minion mini-movies and definitely get Despicable Me 2 as well.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|My son introduced me to this game and from the minute I started playing I have been addicted to it. I call it my bad day game. If I'm having  bad day I kill the world. I can play nonstop for hours and the same goes for my kid and my husband now to!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|It is so sad that they ended it that way. It was also most suspenseful. Nothing like the movie I watched
B009AY04A8|5.0|This game is very exciting. Your mind is always working &amp; you nexer know what is coming next. Takes you to a whole different world.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I loved this book!  It is fiction but the research that was done to write this book was excellent.  I would definitely recommend it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Very well thought-out app. Quite intuitive and easy to understand. I wish that all apps were this uncomplicated and straight forward.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|It did not suck me in as well as the other two books, but it was a good book. A happy ending is in the eye of the beholder. The crazy reviews for this book are waht made me want to start reading the series to begin with because i wanted to know what people were so up in arms about to begin with! It was a worthwhile series. I am excited to see the movie in 2014.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Lee Child books about Jack Reacher are always gong to be top class. He's a great story teller and his writing style is right up ther with the master, Wilbur Smith
B004X2M3N8|4.0|Dr. Who as it should be funny, adventurous, and smart! I gave it 4 stars instead of five because I wanted more moments between Eleven and Sexy!!!
1400052181|5.0|because it is a story that needed to be told and it was very well written a must read !!
B00GINENG0|3.0|I think this game would be even more fun if I could finish letting him grow!!! Every time I almost get to level 10 the screen blacks out and I can't see anything. I can hear him but not see him. I uninstalled an  reinstalled and started over. I almost got to level 10 again and it blacked out again. Please fix and I will rate 5 stars!!!
B0000X61UU|5.0|This one is an oldie but goody.  I bought this workout when it first came out many years ago on VHS, and it is still one of the best workouts on the market today!  It's a whole body workout doing some cardio as warm up in the beginning and then it moves on to , legs, arms and abs.  It moves right along, and you know that Cindy actually does this workout on a regular basis for herself, so you can achieve great results, and get the body you want, and you will if you stick with it.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Extraordinary story teller, John Grisham, delivers an ending that was unexpected.  This will soon be another Grisham tale made into a movie..
B007SGM084|1.0|UGH!  Yuk what crap!  Too bad I spent money on this dribble!  I got to the first third of the first book and just got sick.  Why someone would waste their time reading this is beyond me!  Why someone would waste their time writing this I a puzzle.  I do know some who have read the trilogy and said things got better as it went but holding my interest to get past where I am is tough!  I would give it a minus 3 stars if that was possible.
0875428940|5.0|I had this years ago but unfortunately it got misplaced so I bought it again and it is definately my favorite tarot deck!
B000VI12ZS|2.0|Nick Cages acting remarkable isn't the worst part of this movie (though it is especially terrible).  The story has a strong backbone and is based in history but there is lots of unnecessary and poorly done dialogue.  I wish it was done better as the book was so good.  I wouldn't recommend this movie at all.
B000001GPX|5.0|These are simply the best interpretations of these Beethoven symphonies. If you do not have them please get them, you will never go back to ANY other version of the 5th or 7th ever in your life, unless someone else comes up with something better.<br /><br />If you already have other versions of these symphonies, but this CD and compare.  If you do not have these, probably this is all you need.<br /><br />This is Carlos Kleiber at his best with the Vienna Philharmonic at their best. You can't go wrong.
B00CGNYDIE|3.0|It's a fun game, particularly if you're partial to this type of game.  However, at the higher levels too often there isn't sufficient information to actually solve the puzzle without guessing.  If it's a logic game, then I should be able to solve it with logic.  Otherwise, it's just an elaborate version of &#34;I Spy&#34; where the only way to move forward is to guess what the colour might be.  Even the hints eventually have you guessing.<br /><br />If would be better if logic ruled and guessing didn't.
B000002KYR|4.0|Favorite ZZ Top album. Now I can have it in the car. That \\"little band from Texas\\" has a way, and that way comes across with this work. I though I had typed enough words, so, here are some more.
B0041D843M|5.0|I am applauding. As a former home economics teacher with more college hours of human nutrition than most doctors, I have always known a direct link between food and health, but I never understood why my doctor didn't know what I already knew. To think that we would rather have disease and medicine rather than good food and health is disgusting.  Wake up people! It's YOUR body.
B000002J09|4.0|Good addition to my CD collection. I have had the LP version for many years, now I have it for my car.
B00EDPFGMU|5.0|Phenomenal album by Drake. Along with Born Sinner, one of the most anticipated albums of the year. The songs blend into one another so you can't tell where one ends and the next begins. As an artist, Drake's progression is obvious here.
B000001FS3|4.0|This is my favorite U2 album. Its is nice to be able to listen to it in the car. Like the music.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|Gets the job done - gives a direct gigabit connection to my Macbook Air so I can change my router settings after a reset.
B004GYY714|5.0|works great on kindle fire. Is ideal for listening to progams that no longer broadcast over the air, but broadcast over the internet. the other bonus is that is free.
B00A6CCF0K|1.0|So disappointing!!  I have loved Stephen King since the old days of Carrie, Christine, and of course The Shining.  I couldn't wait for this book to come out; the idea of meeting Danny Torrance as an adult was fascinating to me!  Danny (now Dan) is an interesting character, but this story was so incredibly boring I couldn't believe it came from SK.  The villains were like stock characters from a Hollywood movie.  I didn't care about the little girl who needed Dan's help; the author just doesn't give us anything to love about this kid. SK is always so good at giving his characters depth and making you know them, but he missed it on this one.  I didn't even finish the book, and that is saying something.
B008JFUNHI|3.0|Ender's Game had a lot working for it. There was mostly solid performances and some good special effects, with a decent plot.<br /><br />However, as someone who never read Ender's Game the book, I have to admit that the problem I had with the movie is that it felt like at the end of the film, I was watching an entirely different type of movie than I had for the first part..<br /><br />Through about the first 4/5ths of the movie, I was watching a film that seemed to combine two distinct types of films: a coming of age a story and a kick tail sci fi action film. The Coming of Age story was particularly marked as Ender progressed. He gained the respect of peers and even a sergeant who swore he would never salute Ender. He grew and became a leader as his true potential was brought to the fore.  While there were indications that the Graff was rushing to violence, Ender showed enough character, compassion, and decency that you felt he'd do the right thing once in command.<br /><br />***Spoilers***<br /><br />And then he commits genocide by blowing up the alien planet, after being tricked by the adults who were using actual ships in his last simulation. As a viewer, I felt like I'd suffered a bait and switch.  While there were some darker scenes, nothing really suggested that the whole alien threat was in the mind of the adults. Nothing suggested what would happen. Colonel Graff  looked like the tough and determined Coach/Authority figure pushing our young hero to greatness not the crazy paranoid guy who wanted to go to total war with aliens just in case.<br /><br />The 30 day countdown shown in one scene made even the most extreme behavior to prepare Ender seem okay because after all it was 30 days until the alien bug apocalypse. Apparently if you read the book, you'd know it was 30 days until we invaded the aliens, but again that's not how it looked to me.<br /><br />To be fair, it did seem the adults didn't actually plan on Ender blowing up the alien world. They were more like, &#34;Hmm. Okay, that works.&#34;<br /><br />The adaptation from the book is at times sloppy. For example, while we don't know the aliens language, we do know the name of the species. How? Also, why the heck did the aliens who wanted peace spend decades making no effort to make amends with Earth while thousands of Earth ships set themselves to invade, instead opting to contact the young boy who was to lead the forces against the planet and speaking to him in vague dream imagery. And why the heck did they promote a kid to Admiral, put him on a shuttle , and send him on his merry way?<br /><br />I've read some reviewers suggest that this should have been made into two movies to provide more detail and explanation, but if they told the story the same way, I would have been more annoyed to watch two movies that end with our hero being duped into genocide.<br /><br />Based on box office results, this is probably the only film we'll see in this series and it's quite a pathetic ending. The only thing the ending does do is make you empathize with Ender. Just as he was told the simulation would be one thing, the movie told us it was one thing until the very end when it became something else entirely in a way that's not clever, but really annoying.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Confusing because none of the peripheral characters were developed enough to tell them apart or to care about them, different from previous 2 books in the series, terrible ending. Makes me sorry I started the whole thing.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I loved this book.  A change from my usual purchases.  It had a little bit of everything.  The only thing that was a tad bit annoying was the detail of checking everything over and over.  I understand the problem but sooo much detail over and over.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|I am not good at writing book reviews, but I will say that each time I put these works down, I could not wait to pick back up again. I found them to be exciting, intriguing, totally satisfying. Diverse characters, intricate plots, plenty of puzzles. I absolutely loved this entire trilogy and highly recommend it.
B00C7607BC|5.0|A favorite of mine and now of my daughter's. The Blu-Ray looks great and having a digital copy is pretty awesome!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I loved this trilogy!  I have read all of the books in the Millennium Trilogy and none of them disappointed me.
B007SGM084|5.0|I routinely read paranormal romance stories. I was supremely happy with these books. I could not put them down. I would highly recommend them too
B00CNQ7CRI|3.0|Book is trite.  The nit business was disgusting.  I would not recommend this book.  The humor was Britsh, maybe it is funny.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is really fun. it has a lot of different awesome unique cool levels. so much fun! love love love it! :)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved it! It wasn't too hard or too easy. I definitely recommend this game for fun that doesn't get you frustrated.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I have a real weakness for the &#34;town with a secret&#34; trope, and that's why I bought this book. The promise of finding out the ultimate secret kept me engrossed, and I was not disappointed when it came. Very good use of my reading time overall. Not sure the sequel can hold my attention now that the cat's been let out of the bag, but I'll be trying it.
B00886XQO0|5.0|This really upped my Cod game, works great for other titles also.  I've been having issues with deteriorating battery life recently.
0525953728|5.0|Could not put it down.  The dedication and devotion to duty is extraordinary.  This will make you appreciate the sacrifices our men and women in the military endure.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|IntereSting not as u expected but it was a good book still it's very surprising at the end of the book
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I like this author quite a bit and this book didn't disappoint -- it was a little darker and not quite as humorous and other Liane Moriarty books I've read, but a page-turner nonetheless
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Great plot, lot's of interesting characters Very imaginative world the author has created although is it is very reminiscent of medieval Britain with Turkey or central Asia on the other side of the sea instead of France.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Finally a book that seems to be in the old original John Grisham style. This book picks up with many of the characters from A TIME TO KILL.  Sycamore Row is well written and easy to read. I had given up on Grisham for a while when he was using other authors. This is worth your time to revisit Grisham again.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Seriously beautiful game. Graphics are gorgeous, game play is flawless. I'm totally impressed with this game.<br /> I played the original on Facebook for about a year or so until I moved on to the tablet..specifically the kindle Fire hd..I have missed playing zynga games,so I was thrilled when I saw this available.<br />The goals and characters are just like I remember, the only thing I can complain about is I can't seem to figure out how to move the buildings after placing them...either its just me or its something they are working on..<br />all in all this is a must play if your a zynga gamer or was, like me. HAPPY gaming all.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think that dispicable me minion rush is really fun. plus I loveless despicable me expesally the minions. there so cute.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Truly underwhelming book about a great man. Too much about family and not enough about missions. Shame he didn't have a better ghost-writer. Snore.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Enjoy the subject matter.  The writing. The plot.  just love it all.  keeps me interested. Do not want to put the book down once I start.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|This was so predictable-so banal such a waste of time I couldn't read the whole thing.  I tried-but it's awful
0399159347|4.0|A secret can shatter lives.  Liane Moriaty explores the impact of a secret on a family prior to and following its revelation.  It is well paced story with an ending that disappointed me.  Considering the gravity of the situation everything wraps up into a neat, tidy package and the characters disappear back to where they came from -- the land of the semi-happy.
140006922X|5.0|This book allows the reader to see Jesus as a human being in a given period of time and a specific geographic location.  Invaluable information concerning the religious practices that Jesus, as a Jew, would have been under are included along with much of Jewish history.  There are only two points that need more attention or were not included that I would stress.  I think the fact that Jesus never led an armed rebellion against Rome as did other &#34;messiahs of that time period&#34; needs more emphasis.  The trial of Jesus as outlined in this book relies on the Jewish authorities actually following their own written rules.  This group of Jewish authorities are repeatedly described as corrupt etc and I cannot accept that such a group would follow any rules that would hinder them from what they physically could do.  No book is ever going to be perfect but this one comes as close as one could wish.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so glad I don't have to log onto Facebook to get my fix. The game is challenging while still being fun.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|In the spirit of The Diary of Anne Frank from from a different angle. A realistic look at the resiliency of the human spirit of a child. Very moving.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I think it's a great game.I'm having lots of fun with it,keeps you sharp and on your toes thinking.Go diamond rush.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Couldn't get enough of it. Love this novel. Hope to see it become a movie.<br />There are monsters. Some you can see, some you cannot. Be more afraid of the latter.
1616551607|5.0|A lot heavier than I expected! I was impressed with shipping time (super fast) and how well-made this seems. The cover is beautiful fabric. I bought this as a gift so I have not explored the inside. My friend loves it, however, so I will take her word on it.
B009LDCZ7I|4.0|An exciting story  and the acting is supurb...anxious to see season 3, though the reviews on it have not been great..<br />I'll take a chance anyway... Claire Danes and Damian Lewis are among the best in a  series.....T.V is terrible these days and its so nice to have the DVD'd to watch @ ones leisure..... commericial free !!!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I enjoy this Bingo game, perhaps it is the voice variety and all the different regional accents there is just something more interesting than the usual cartoon silliness on other games.  Although free, and very winnable without using real cash, the pricing is good.  Hope it continues with no advertising.  great game and appropriate for all ages that know their numbers.
1781162646|5.0|This is another great book from the master. He really is a living legend. I love the whole story, the characters, the story, twists and turns. And really there was a surprise at the end.<br />Loved it.
0307744434|5.0|This book was enchanting, I loved the whole story and wish that I could visit such an amazing circus one day!
B00DC6YEE2|1.0|I hate Tim Burton, I think.  I do love Henry Sellick and I think his 'Coraline' is the BEST stop motion out there.  The nightmare before xmas is too creepy for me, just plain morbid.  In my humble opinion, one can tell this movie is 20 years old.  The 3D is not bad, but not spectacular either.
B00FOWX6NM|1.0|I would not recommend this product at all because I have only used for 1 week and the back of the cover is torn from the brown bumper and makes the whole cover looks so annoying.It is really a huge disappointment on this product
1589944607|5.0|This game really is amazing and I love playing it. It is a bit long, especially the first couple of times you play it, but it's worth it. As a fan of the show I am amazed at how the board game manages to capture the feel of the show. The tension builds as the cyclon attacks build up and... then BAM, you make the jump and things are calm again (for a little while). I've played this game with fans of the show and people who've never seen it - I think those that never watched the show enjoy it less and have less of a context as to who people are and what is going on. They still seem to enjoy the game though.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Access all of the Kindle library makes this ap valuable even though the ap is free!. It is easy to use and I already have enjoyed a book from kindle on it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love it spool much,  only thing is I run out of lives and don't like it Lol other than thy thumbs up! :)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game.  Challenging yet fun. Enjoyed playing it as a family with everyone guessing.  And you can't beat the price.
B008220BP2|2.0|Not very imaginative or exciting. Dull script and predictable .not really a good story line or anything to hold your attention.
B00FPGSPQU|2.0|Entertaining but not near as good as Hangover 1 or 2. Poor attempt to match the first two. Feels as if it was written in about a day with the only goal to pump out a third movie, not a quality product. Still fairly decent watch, not a total waste of time.
0143116177|5.0|I never took an economics class, but I've had a growing interest in the subject of the last few years.  Mr. Ferguson gives an excellent and entertaining history of how money has shaped modern civilization.  I'm looking forward to reading his future works as well.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Typical of John Grisham, I found this book hard to put down.  An excellent story with insights into Court Trial preparation and life in the Legal field in the Deep South.
006202406X|5.0|Those giving Allegiant a low rating are doing so because they wish for a fairy tale ending.  Roth follows the hard path to the finale of this series, following the true course of the story.  She made the tough decision to end this series on the correct note over the happy note.<br />I couldn't read through the final chapters quick enough!  Very rarely do I enjoy a second edition to a series, let alone a third!<br />Although not a ride off into the sunset ending, this book was truly the perfect ending to this amazing series!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|best game ever so so fun and addictive. I live this game I have such a good time playing it it hives me something to do
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This is definitely fun to play. So far I am having no problems with the app. It's a great continuation of the original castleville on Facebook.
B001HOF8AA|5.0|I love Imelda May! She is from Ireland so it is rare to catch her in a concert tour. But I have my tickets to Viva Las Vegas Rockabilly Weekend and she is performing there! Can't wait!
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|The game itself is cute and fun, but if you run out of lives you either have to BUY more ($0.99 for a batch of lives--and this is not the only things they're selling), or wait up to half an hour for 1 life to be available.  With so many free, fun games out there, this strategy to try and force the user to pay to play seems quite counterproductive.  The over-all feeling is to simply walk away and not bother with it anymore.  If they want to give the option to purchase, fine; but they seem to want to twist the user's arm by trying his/her patience, and that's not fine.  I can understand why it has received such low scores in some of its reviews.
B0000VD04M|5.0|This is a great story about a very peculiar director/producer in Hollywood a long time ago. I think Johnny Depp and everybody in it did such a great acting job.
B009ZE27US|3.0|it was ok to fool around with but I would imagine a teenager having more fun then a adult, but I guess its who the adult is,
B00DURHYWC|5.0|I love it! A very talented group of wonderful musicians from Portland Oregon! Pink Martini is my favorite band on the planet!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Keeps me connected with all my friends and family and what is happening around the world. I love all the pins
B008NW67E0|5.0|I love the music of this group.  I believe &#34;beauty is in the eye of the beholder&#34; even when it comes to good music.  If you like Bluegrass or Celtic music you will most likely love this too.
B00E8B1358|5.0|it would been better if the movie would not have been starting and stoping I would like to see it again this out the trouble watching the movie so I hope you  can do somthing  ?
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really like this game. So far it's fairly challenging and I love those kinds of games. It's going to be my newest favorite game.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|In some ways this is an ingeniously written book and one that probably warrants re-reading to fully appreciate its intricate organization and absorb its pithy messages.  I pushed myself to read the first part of the book and it wasn't until I was well into the second part - and after I had read the author interview at the end - that the first part made sense. The author's depiction of North Korea's culture in regard to the value of human life was also compelling, especially when contrasted with that of the U.S. And it was a good reminder of the power of the &#34;big lie.&#34;  I gave only 4 stars because some of the conversation, especially in the first part, felt artificial and stilted.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Great movie...very entertaining, not a boring movie and loved the ending.  Would recommend this movie to all.  Oh, and not a bloody or cursing movie.
B00991TCOG|5.0|She is amazing. Happy, lively music! She is outstanding. Talented. Uplifting. Energizing. I cannot imagine practicing as much as she to have done.
1936891026|5.0|Inspiring read. It's a book I am going to read over and over. The War of Art is about recognizing, confronting, and defeating resistance and procrastination.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|a good read, a typical quick and easy Grisham read.  There were a lot of lawyers and names that were often hard to follow, but the story was good, the characters great.  Very enjoyable.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|This is a good book with unexpected twists!  The characters are likeable, and it reminded me of A Wrinkle in Time for some reason, probably the fantasy aspect of it.  Enjoyable and I want to read more of his books!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This is a wonderful CD. Love the sound, use it in the car and in my phone, recommend this CD and singer. I can't imagine that you have not heard her sound,  it would make a great gift for any age.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book  was a part of history that I did not know even existed in the United States.  It is a must read for everyone.  If you think you have it bad, read this book and you will realize what these children when though for most of their lives.  Some got lucky, some did not.
B0012UNWJ8|5.0|I love this heartwarming film about this young boy and his gift for playing Chess. I originally saw it in the theater and have loved it ever since. I started watching it with my own son when he was about six and he still loves it to this day. I loved being able to download it to my Kindle and watch the same day, it was instantaneous!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun game, it is just challenging enough to make you really think but not so hard you quit, but now I want more levels!
0634022296|4.0|Great book and easy to read.  It is a Christmas gift he loves the Beatles and I am sure he will like it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy to see candy crush finally on my Kindle. Love, fun and takes up all my free time. SMILE!
B005ZB91KY|5.0|Very thought out and for a long movie was still entertained. The actor is a good personality for this part.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|GREAT GAME!Hours of fun and easy to play.Graphics are spectacular as is the complete experience.I would recommend this game to everyone!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I think this story teaches you a nice lesson which is that no matter how people  look  they might be amazing people that's what happened in the story with the main character Auggie.<br />I love this book .<br />I think people who like sad and cute and sweet books will like this amazing book Wonder.<br />  By Malu Maria Luisa z. Hall Age 9
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|My kindle was almost 100% full and it seemed like the more I deleted apps the bigger the memory gets. So I decided to look for an app and this one is working wonders. It is very very good for a free app.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|A real classic!  Very funny, with a great cast.  A &#34;must watch&#34; flick when the family is together for the holidays.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|very fun... to much work with the tickets though. lives should also come through quicker.......the waiting. makes me move on to other games
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Great movie full of action and excellent video and sound quality.  I stream thru PS3. I liked this Bond movie more than Casino Royal.  Q was a nice addition
1451695195|5.0|The author felt strongly enough about his message to the reader that even knowing the possible negative feedback from his contemporaries, the felt obligated to write it.  That speaks volumes for the accuracy he worked very hard to present.  This was truly in my mind his soul speaking to mine.
B00E193TM2|5.0|I am big fan of tthier music and this cd doesn't let you down. 5FDP does it again  theirs is a sound that can't be matched. JUST BUY IT. YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED
B003F1WM2K|4.0|I love the Patti Smith Group, and their break-through music remains a favorite of mine.<br />but Just Kids is not rock and roll. It is a journalistic autobiography that recounts what Patti remembers of her life from early adolescence to the death of Robert Mapplethorpe.  It gives some insight into that time and her long love affair with Mapplethorpe, largely in a gossipy colloquial style that resembles an 'as told to' pop bio.  As one might expect from our pop culture, most of the famous mentioned are names dropped along the way with little detail or interest. Still, it fills in some dark corners of life in NYC and is an honest and even humble story of the artist in development.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|This app is great and all but why cant I watch videos in full quality.  Love the app but its bugs like this that drive me insane
0374533555|5.0|A rare book that has the author doing original thinking, not just churning what we already know. Kahneman's book should be required reading for every politician who asserts that his/her planned legislation is desirable. For that matter, it should be required reading for every judicial system judge in order to be appointed to the bench. Likewise for every student who wants to learn anything.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|My nephew recommended this movie.  It was much better than I ever thought it would be. It was suspenseful and smart.
B00EK0UBPU|2.0|Vivid, complex and lush descriptions of details that sometimes do not have any bearing on the story line. Yet despite these lavish and often lengthy descriptions, I felt very little empathy or relationship to the characters. I noted that the scene, detail and character descriptors were often marched out rigidly in groups threes. I would assume this book is academically a golden specimen, but I found the reading of it required a fair amount of &#34;soldiering on&#34;. The story would have been superb were it about 200 pages shorter. The story itself was magnificent, but the length and detail it consists of has made many sections I would describe as simply tedious.  The shame of it is I believe many people will simply skim over some of the mundane descriptors, which often go on for pages and pages!
B000E6UK5K|5.0|Best album since the demise of PF.  Can't understand why it took me 7 years to find it.  Gilmour's guitar is mesmerizing.  Tracks 2, 4, 9 and 10 are going to be legends.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Very easy to use and I could use my cell phone or Galaxy note 8 to control it. Just download the application and connect to wireless you done. Only thing I have problem is you could not return this guy off. you have to either connect it to TV all the time or unplug it.
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|Fun game, easy to learn and play. I downloaded it when it was free, but it would be worth paying for.
B004SKLD9A|4.0|I've always enjoyed this movie.  It's very dystopian and even though it borrows a lot from other SiFi works and kind of jams them together, it's still works and feels fresh.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|It was an easy read and interesting novel. Would recommend to young readers that are interested in good fantasy stories.
B001TODCII|5.0|This is a classic movie. Great storyline, acting, and action. You wonder how in the world will he find his daughter. It's amazing to watch it unfold!
B003B02O0A|5.0|Time to Kill is Grisham at his best!  With his vivid character description and sharp details, I felt as if I were there at the trial watching Jake Brigance defend Carl Lee Hailey.  Carl Lee Hailey was accused of murdering the two violent men who attacked, raped, and almost killed his nine year old daughter.  Racial tension, violence, and suspense are present throughout this exciting novel.
B0001I55OC|4.0|I really liked this movie. So much action and romance. And Gerard Butler is hot! Great time travel movie. I understand there's a book, but I haven't read it.  Very enjoyable!
B008VNIA32|5.0|The best &#34;Ring&#34; cycle ever! So much better than the Met 2013 Wagner birthday release, these performances date from the 1992 time frame, and focus on singing and story-telling. Wagner created his own version of the myths and legends of the Tuetonic/Norse people, and this Ring portrays those story lines beautifully. Sung in German with multiple subtitle options, the vocal work is glorious, especially Sieglinde, mother of Siegfried, and the &#34;bra&uuml;tliche Schwester&#34; (bride-like sister) of Siegmund, who also impresses in this heroic role. Wotan (Odin) in this production is the glue that holds all together, and is spectacularly sung and acted. At the end of the day, it is Wagner who is the winner here, and I've never heard a better Ring cycle.<br />Blu-ray, 4 Operas on 4 Discs,

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It is easy to play and yet, it is challenging when you reach the higher levels. It just passes the time.
B001XVP9CY|5.0|This is a great version of a great movie.  It is a bit longer than the original release and it doesn't have the horrible Harrison Ford voice-over narration that the studio required.<br /><br />If you're not familiar with the film, it is an excellent film that attained cult status in 1992 when it was rereleased.  The original theatrical version had an abysmal voice over that pulled you out of immersion in the film to explain things you could have figured out on your own from context, or that didn't help the enjoyment of the film.<br /><br />For example, in one place the narration of the theatrical release explains the language spoken in the slums of the future, where it comes from and who speaks it.  In this version in the same spot, there is music building dramatic tension.  Notoriously, the voice over originally contradicted the ending of the film, explaining the finish differently from how it actually happened.  Harrison Ford, Ridley Scott, the director, and even the author of the voice over hated it, but the studio insisted because early test audiences found the movie confusing.<br /><br />This version does not have that voice over, and it's a great version of the film.<br /><br />Mark your calendar for your Roy Batty's incept date, January 8, 2016! (Roy is a main character played by Rutger Hauer)

B008AK8FHM|4.0|Fascinating description and self-analysis of the author's near death experience.  I would have liked more details of his own perceptions during his experience rather than what was going on around him during that time but the book does offer plenty to think about and consider.  Worth reading.

B00BAXFAJC|5.0|Brilliant, thrilling, complex, complicated, dense, convoluted -- a work of great art. Catton is a major talent but it will be a tall challenge to top this one.

B000OVLINI|5.0|The writing is gorgeous. Bravo to the translator. The characters are richly defined and as a mystery it is a page-turner. All of these factors make it a great read but it has even more. It shows the effects of the Spanish Civil war and WWII on every character including Barcelona as a character. What an outstanding book.

B00FWLDHSY|1.0|I just reviewed &#34;The Heat&#34; and said it was bad, but this thing is 10X worse.  A nerd who lives in his grandmother's basement MIGHT like it.  Doesn't' deserve even one star.
B00AAI7B7W|4.0|All these years and I'd never seen The Exorcist. When I was a young teenager, I was too frightened to watch it. Then, I kind of forgot about it, even though I felt like I had seen it because there was so much controversy over it, especially in the conservative Christian churches I attended. Seeing it 40 years (really?) later, I appreciate its importance in film history and in our culture. It's also just a good story. I especially like the conflict within the doubting priest and how he stays true to his calling in the end.
B00004SC3M|5.0|Very intriguing with a surprise of romance.  Love is a beautiful thing that can happen to us when we least expect it.

B00006BSGZ|5.0|Maria Callas, the incomparable one. This DVD gives us a glimpse of her greatness.as a stunning soprano, gifted actress, with a remarkable ability to interpret her role and convey her deep-felt interpretation to her audience in a spellbound way. She is the complete package. She has no equal.<br /><br />This is a must-have recording.

B009EP3DJM|5.0|As I write this review, Ke$ha's second full-length \\"Warrior\\" has been out almost exactly one year.  So many artists whose success breaks out almost overnight and like a firestorm on their debut, as was the case with Ke$ha in 2010, are sure to fizzle out considerably on subsequent releases.  Well, I am glad to report to you that this is most certainly not the case here!<br /><br />Far from being a sophomore slump of any kind, \\"Warrior\\" may be even better than its predecessor.  While there is nothing here that is quite the level of \\"instant classic\\" in terms of radio accessibility as was her breakout hit \\"Tik Tok,\\" overall \\"Warrior\\" is a step forward in other ways and a more mature, well-rounded album.  I think this has a lot to do with Ke$ha's lyrics being a little more meaningful and substantive on this one.  All told, there are still a fair amount of the type of lyrics about a free-spirited party lifestyle that we have come to know and love from her like \\"I don't wanna go to sleep/I want to stay up all night/I don't want to think about what's going to be after this/I want to just live right now\\" (from \\"C'mon\\").  Phrases like these make Ke$ha's music the ideal party music.  I know I work second shift and I love listening to her CDs in the middle of the night until, well, \\"when the sun's comin' up.\\"  Her lyrics such as these assert a central and universal theme, of both how good it is to be young and how good it is to be alive.  Ke$ha's music is true to herself.  She doesn't water it down or make it all flowery and diluted like some mainstream pop stars do.  She is the real deal.  She can rap like she's from the streets to be sure, with even the occasional f-bomb thrown in here and there for good measure, and yet there is always that remnant present of her suburban Tennessee valley girl roots as well.  Ke$ha is an outcast at heart, almost like a hybrid of the Sex Pistols and electro dance pop.  I love how in my favorite track here, \\"Wherever You Are,\\" when she says,\\"Love will never die,\\" she says the word \\"die\\" with such a defiant sneer, not unlike Johnny Rotten before her.  Very convincing and distinctive.  Finally, perhaps the lyrics that stand out the most to me are in closer \\"Love into the Light,\\" where Ke$ha poses the question (to paraphrase her):  \\"Can we all get over (our differences) and stop talking (garbage)\\" about each other?  Something for all of us to consider, no doubt, and a superb way to end this excellent album.<br /><br />So, if you can't already tell, I absolutely love this CD and Ke$ha, which is why I can't for the life of me fathom why \\"Warrior,\\" although it's been a modest success, has, even after a year, yet to achieve gold status sales-wise, unlike its multi-platinum predecessor.  I love both albums and own and will buy anything she ever puts out.  She is my favorite female artist to come along in years.  All in all, \\"Warrior\\" is a super successful sophomore outing.  The songs are catchy, fun to listen to, and life-affirming.  Highly recommended to any and all Ke$ha fans!

1605065684|3.0|Like many Frankenstein books this one does not state whether it is the superior 1818 version or the heavily modified 1831 version. I was looking to buy both editions to see the difference and decided to start out with the 1818 version. Usually with the &#34;original text&#34; title comes the actually original text. Which this is not. This is the 1831 version<br /><br />Just in case you decided to look through the books in an actually store here is 2 easy ways to tell which is which.<br /><br />1: the 1831 version starts off with Letter 1-4, then proceeds to Chapters 1-24.<br />  Sadly I do not know how the 1818 version is structured but it is apparently different.<br /><br />2: The last lines have a slight change.<br /><br />1818 version: He sprung from the cabin window as he said this upon an ice raft that lay close to the vessel and pushing himself  off he was carried away by the waves and I soon lost sight of him in the darkness and distance.<br /><br />1831 version: He sprung from the cabin-window, as he said this, upon the ice-raft which lay close to the vessel. He was soon borne away by the waves, and lost in darkness and distance.<br /><br />If you do not care about which edition you have than this is more than okay to buy. If you are looking for a certain edition (specifically the 1818 version) I suggest going to a book store looking through the books before hand.
B00EPFEY44|5.0|I love everything he sings, makes my heart just a little lighter! The DVD is great to watch, turn up the surround sound on the TV and it is like you are in Portofino!
B000SP3DE2|2.0|I'll be honest and straight forward. The biggest issue I have with this movie is the title. If the title were changed, then most of my other gripes would be eliminated.<br /><br />Before I go on a mini rant about how the changes from the source material became this movies' downfall I will point out the good aspects of it.<br /><br />-There is a great atmosphere throughout the whole movie.<br />- The costumes were done amazingly well, especially for Dracula.<br />And that's about it. . .<br /><br />Now my biggest gripes were with the characters and story.<br /><br />Jonathan Harker was hardly even there, even when he was the focus. Granted, in the book, he was downplayed after the first few opening chapter so that other characters could shine. This, though, is just sad. I don't know whether to blame it on bad writing or bad acting from Reeves. Probably both.<br /><br />Mina Harker is just a disgrace compared to her original self. In the story she was smart, very loyal to the people she loved, was very tormented, but still strong.<br />In the movie she is almost quite the opposite. She just decides out of nowhere that she's gonna to start seeing Dracula romantically when her fiance, Jonathan, is still missing. Even when he turns up and sends for her she tells Lucy that she might not even go see him. So now Mina turned from a loyal lover to a slut who acts as if she doesn't care for anyone.<br /><br />Lucy Westenra has almost the exact same thing happen to her. She turned from a sweet tortured girl to a girl who is leading 3 men on at the same time. Plus all the pain and agony that is detailed in the book is slowly sucked away in this story. All of the pity you could even feel for this character is snuffed out because she is almost nothing more than a sex toy to the villian. I knew Hollywood could never write good female characters unless it came to sex, but geez.<br /><br />I don't have much complaints about Doctor Seaward within the movie. He was just pushed to the side most of the time and seemed more like a creep here.<br /><br />Again, I have little complaints about the Texan, Quincy Morris. He hardly even talked in the book and his death is just as anti-climatic as ever.<br /><br />Arthur Holmwood, Lucy's finace, also had little changes. So nothing much to say.<br /><br />While Dr. Van Helsing had one major change in personality (for a comedic effect) I honestly don't mind it much. In the book he sometimes came off as a know-it-all rude person. In this he is more light-hearted and emotional while still being very smart and respectable.<br /><br />And now for the greatest travesty, Dracula. One of the most iconic villians of all time was ruined by one little thing. They turned him into a horndog.<br />I know the whole sexual vampire thing was just starting with cinema around the time of this movie, but seriously! It's honestly a disgrace to the character,<br /><br />It is worth noting though that most of the actors did the best they could with what they had. Anthony Hopkins steal the show yet again while Keanu &#34;Cardboard&#34; Reeves is just there.<br /><br />Most of the story story flaws were pointed out when I was complaining about the characters (Mina leaving Jonathan, a sexual Dracula, slutty women, ect). If you compare the original story with this you can already tell which parts would leave fans of the book sour so I won't go on about that. There are 1 scene I would like to point out though.<br /><br />The beginning scene shows Dracula when he is human. After his love kills herself after a misunderstanding Dracula renounces god and stabs a huge cross. Which then goes on to squirt out gallons on red water which is supposed to be blood. This scene is quite odd. The over the top blood effects were not needed (this is not a Troma film). Plus this whole ordeal makes him a vampire?  The throw-away explanation from Nosferatu seems like Shakespeare compared to this origin of vampires. This scene and the whole reincarnationsub-plot could have easily been done away with.<br /><br />All in all, when compared to the book this is a horrible movie. Like I said, though, most of my problems with the characters and story could have been overlooked if it wasn't for the title stating it as Bram Stoker's story.<br />But what about without the book? Well, then this is a decent film. It just depends on whether you can get past some bad acting, rushed story, and sexual vampires. If you have never read the book and am not interested in it I would suggest the movie. If you have read the book, I wouldn't.<br /><br />I honestly liked this movie years ago when I first saw it. Now it is unbearable to watch.
B00DSO9RMC|3.0|Not Terry's easiest read. However, it was good to spend a while re-visiting with Moist, Death, the Patrician perhaps for one last time. The wry humour and verbal games were missing. I appreciate the effort, however. Thanks, Terry, its been immense fun from beginning to end.

I find the mood and tone of the whole album to be very uplifting/inspiring. It makes me really happy to support independent artists, and I've gotten my money's worth in terms of sheer joy. It looks like the price has more than doubled since I bought the album, but even at the current price...it'd still be worth it.

0062082841|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moT1UTVY6D16UL]]If you like Guillermo del Toro's films, heard of his Bleak House but have never seen what's inside, or just admire his sense and sensibilities, this is going to be an incredible book for you. It provides wonderful insight into the working mind of a director and eclectic collector.<br /><br />This is a big and heavy book. The hardcover is nicely embossed to make it feel like a wooden bookshelf. Inside, the book is filled with plenty of pictures and extensive text which makes for a substantial reading.<br /><br />The book's roughly split into three parts, covering his collections, notebooks and lastly the unfinished projects.<br /><br />The first part shows off the amazing collection of items found in his man cave, also known as Bleak House. There are photos of the different rooms and the incredible amount of objects he collects. There are movie props, huge piles of books, all sorts of character figures, a few life-size sculptures, one is of H.P. Lovecraft, in the hallway there's the monster Sammael from Hellboy and many more. The whole place feels like an intimate museum. The photos are delightful, and when you look closely you can spot surprises, such as a Totoro or a book you might also have read.<br /><br />In this section, GDT also talks about his graphic inspirations, on how he read paintings, analyse films, explains his techniques of storytelling and his idea incubating notebooks. Fascinating.<br /><br />The second part on notebooks actually looks at the eight films he has made so far, namely Cronos, Mimic, The Devil's Backbone, Blade II, Hellboy, Pan's Labyrinth, Hellboy II and Pacific Rim.<br /><br />In interview style, author Marc Scott Zicree (MSZ) and GDT talks at length and in detail the inspiration behind each film. It's really insightful to read about how the ideas morph and evolve. No all ideas get used, of course, but you'll still see them in the notebook pages. You'll gain much more if you've watched the movies, although that is not totally necessary, but highly recommended. Pacific Rim's coverage is sadly much shorter than the other films.<br /><br />The numerous scanned notebook pages really provides another dimension to how GDT's mind works. There's quite a lot to read from the notebooks' captions alone. Also included are amazing concept designs from GDT himself.<br /><br />GDT says the notebooks are for his daughters, but they only draw manga style and find his drawings reprehensible and horrible. That's pretty funny. Author MSZ managed to elicit lots of interesting bits of information with thoughtful questions.<br /><br />The last part on unfinished projects is quite brief. Five projects are mentioned with each taking two pages.<br /><br />Interspersed throughout the book are also write-up by prominent guests, such as James Cameron, John Landis, Alfonso Cuaron, Ron Perlman, Mike Mignola and others just to name a few.<br /><br />What's missing in the book is perhaps his role as a producer on other films. I would love to read about what he does as a producer. It's not mentioned in any way, but that's a small issue.<br /><br />Overall, this is a truly insightful and incredible book.

B0087IT8FK|5.0|This is a feel-good movie, but in an atypical, somewhat provocative way. It was a record-breaking box office hit in France, and is planned for an American remake by the Weinsteins... but I wonder if it's even possible to translate this combination of dark humour and heart-warming obliteration of social barriers. If you liked Amélie, you'll probably like this one too.

I enjoyed the story very much (as predictable as it was).  The game play was good if a little redundant, but there is enough variety to keep it from getting boring.  I look forward to seeing anything else is added to the game in the future.  Overall a well made game and worth the money.  It would be an absolute steal as a FAOTD.

B00F2HW220|5.0|If you've enjoyed any of Arjen Lucassen's works, do yourself a favor and get this album.  Describing it is truly beyond words, it is something you have to experience firsthand to fully comprehend.  As one of the reviewers mentioned previously, the storyline more closely resembles The Human Equation than some of the more grandiose Ayreon albums, and is all the better for it.  This is definitely Arjen at his best, if I could give it 6 stars I would.

B00BAXFECK|5.0|Fantastic story beautifully written. Donna Tartt's very best book yet. Have read all of her books and once I started Goldfinch it was hard to put it down. Don't let the length be daunting.
B00EB9Z9Z2|5.0|superb excellent and very inspiring book...<br />book has inspirational stories of people who were in extreme worse situation.. and now thy are on top<br />really liked this book..<br />thank you Rhonda Byrne for this book
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|The best Star Trek movie in years. The new crew is excellent and the story is good, although it brings back a couple of old enemies in this new reality that skirts off the true nature of their reality and did not explore it suffiently in my opinion.. I will not tell you who this is referring to. All the actors are on their game and seem to understand what Trekkies need and want and don't deviate too much from the original concept.A worhty note:Simon Pegg-EXCELLENT! What a gifted actor. This movies is fast and entertaining. You love it.
B005LAIIMG|4.0|A sequel is needed. Good human interest story about &#34;Z&#34; s(Zombies) which is the craze for now with good perfermances, although, Brad sometimes looks like a deer in the headlights. There should be a sequel to this one which can explore the family situation and reconstruction of the world a little better than the ending leaves you with. The cover poster shows Brad with a gun as a guy not to mess with, but, that is far from the truth. He is a family man that has been thrust into this situation and does what he can to discover the cause. Definitely worth seeing.
B008JFUO36|4.0|Good special effects & a surprise plot twist makes this story interesting. Morgan Freeman always adds another star to any movie project he is in. Entertaining.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Great praise. for this scientist, great disdain for the corporate interests who still will not develop the free energy he discovered.<br />He discovered AC what we use in our daily lives but give no credit to him or his laboratory on Long Island. Only recently is there a push to acknowledge this true visionary.
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|BUY THIS MOVIE! DO NOT READ THE REVIEWS!  IT SPOILS THE WONDERFUL SURPRISE. UPLIFTING, ENTERTAINING, A TRUE INSPIRATION TO THOSE WHO WANT TO GIVE UP.
B002VECLVO|5.0|Brilliantly acted with great resonance to any feeling person about love and loss and exclusion. It lingers in your mind.
B008JFUUIA|2.0|This movie has some cool music, but is pretty trite. I wanted to show it to my middle school music students, but it had too many un-funny sexual remarks in it to be appropriate. That's a shame , because the mentality it would attract would be middle school age. I wish that it were more appropriate for kids. The plot is pretty juvenile, but the jokes and curse words make it inappropriate for kids .
0811876373|5.0|Love the recipes in this book! I have made a few from the book and a few of my own creation...all were great and cake pops are the hit of the party. Just enough cake without the guilt of eating a huge piece of cake. Love them!
1577311523|5.0|Love this book! I read it every once in a while to remind me whats really important in life and to help me find more clarity.
B007QA3AH2|5.0|I don't know why....but I love this film. Always did like Star Trek and this was a very good spoof
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|Very unusual story but I had to keep watching it. Would like to watch it again sometime. Some movies you can watch more than once. This is one of those
B001HM1PFO|5.0|One of the best movies ever. Iconic and funny. My daughter and I watched this for our movie night. She loved it.
0446310786|5.0|One of my all-time favorite books. This format was perfect. I just wanted a copy for my homeschooled son. This was a great inexpensive option.
0802473156|5.0|It provides you with the tools to have a positive, healthy, loving relationship!  I learned so much about both myself and my loved one, but the principles can be applied to anyone in your life that you care about.
B006OE7XM4|5.0|Great voice! Good mix of up tempo and slow jazz songs...a very nice and fresh sound and a powerful voice
B003G4W49C|4.0|Great book. Found two typos in this Kindle edition. Other than that, great fun read at a great price. Thanks!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad to have the app on my kindle. I love this game. So easy to use my two year old plays.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Such an amazing, well done movie. Daniel Day-Lewis is perfect as Lincoln; he literally gave me goosebumps. The movie is lengthy, but by no means dull. It offers a unique viewpoint to Lincoln's emotions, private life, and the fight to end slavery. Just a fantastic movie that I think anyone would appreciate.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|I'm a little tired of the alien story line, but I definitely liked this movie. It has some great actors in it, and a lot of action. Essentially (no surprise) aliens come to our planet for resources and exploring humans (in not so friendly ways - but not too graffic, so don't worry if you have kids). Any feuds or problems need to be set aside to destroy this new threat, and there are some interesting turns in the plot. It's a new take on something bordering overdone, and they did a good job.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|I had ordered this for my father, who is quite the war buff. He absolutely loved it, and I thought it was such a good movie. These brave men were just amazing, and it's so nice to see a movie that really captures who they were and what they could do.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Absolutely gorgeous!! It is visually stunning, and emotionally/psychologically profound. I especially like that it follows the book, which doesn't always happen. It is such a remarkable story told by some one who had endured so much, and grew in so many ways. I don't want to give too much b4ecause it may spoil it, but it really is an amazing movie, and everyone should see.
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|Very much liked the \\"voice\\" Ms. Gilbert uses and the idea of a woman of science at that juncture of history. Interesting conclusions arrived at by the end.
B00AA7V2Z0|5.0|I'm not the biggest fan of horror movies but this was just the perfect amount of scary. It was suspenseful and the character development was on point. Great acting on everyone's part. I was afraid to see what happened next but I was even more afraid to stop watching!
B008I43DYU|2.0|I never knew that there was a skin pack and it cost ninety nine cents! This is an outrage!!!:( thank you very much. By the way don't sue me I'm only 10 and a half:p
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|It's kinda annoying that it keeps doing  thesE same puzzle or hidden object over n over. A more variety puzzle would be better.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Real steel is one of the best games I have ever got. I didn't want to get it because I was afraid it wouldn't be cool.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|My kids love this game,my three year old really likes it and I think it's good for his hand eye cordnation
1577314808|5.0|Tolle of course is an amazing human being. I appreciate his way of coming across very complex, but yet also being able to talk to the layman. Great business!
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|An album that grows on you, its one of my favourite for 2013.<br />Its energetic and meaningful & gets your foot tapping!
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|The premise of this novel had great possibilities -- the development and growth of an on-line world destroying individual privacy expectations, a growth that is embraced by its participants.  Unfortunately, it fails to attain its initial promise.  The protagonist, Mae, is either purposefully vapid and dull or just not fully realized.  She is not an attractive character and why she would attract millions of followers in this make-believe world is a mystery.  Or perhaps that's the point :  even uninteresting people attract a following in a celebrity driven universe not because of any achievement but because of good publicists.  The growth of social networking sites and the  erosion of individual privacy as a direct result is a major issue.  Facebook and Twitter have blurred the lines between what is ours and what is shared.  The conclusion of this novel feel hurried and is unsatisfactory as a result.  This is a cautionary tale and in that respect, it is worth a read.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|Great show, modern day Sherlock Holmes.  Think of Criminal Minds with just the really smart character (Spencer) and a pretty girl.  Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu have a great chemistry, I'm not a big fan of either of them alone, but they're great together.  So I finally am a Lucy Liu fan after all these years of being on the fence about her.
B008Y5T5ZE|5.0|Great Depp movie, a cult classic. I've watched it several times over the years and enjoy it just as much each time. That to me is a measure of a great movie.
B002N7CTKM|5.0|Greatest show ever.  Great characters.  Really original stories and television concepts.  Frequently breaks the \\"fourth wall\\".  Two really pretty girls, an oddball but great guy that does a lot of the fourth wall breaking by referring to whatever they're doing as like something out of a tv show, a cool guy, and Chevy Chase on top of all that!  Sometimes even Jon Oliver!
B004LWZWBU|4.0|We enjoyed this as we had listened to the book on CD as we drove a few years back.  Funny
B00E1L9N8E|5.0|A truly beautiful movie.  Every shot a work of art. Leave it on in the background without sound when entertaining, it's just always pretty to look at.
B004LDLI0S|3.0|The rants of a megalomaniac. It's a hard read because of all the hate this nut case spews, but it is a look into the beginnings of a propaganda program that changed Germany, the German people, and started WW II.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I enjoyed reading and re-living the history of computing. I wanted to remember every detail as I read. It was a marvelous book about an extraordinary man!
B000VDUWMC|5.0|What an interesting book. It all makes perfect sense. The germ was without a doubt the most effective weapon. Why did Europe, and Asia develop so much faster then the rest of the world? Well you will have to read the book.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|“Flabby” popped into my head when the guy to my right on the bus asked how I was liking “Doctor Sleep.”<br /><br />Flabby. That’s what I thought, but I replied, “Sort of scary but not as scary as the Shinning. I liked it but I liked ‘Carrie’ a lot more. And nothing gave me the heebie-jeebies in quite the same way ‘The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon” did.”<br /><br />The guy next to me on the bus said, “If you ask me, the best thing he’s written so far is ‘On Writing.’ “<br /><br />I think I agree with his choice for the best by King.<br /><br />Then I started thinking what I really meant by flabby. “Doctor Sleep” is a long book. Too long, by a third, I think.<br />It didn’t exactly feel padded with a lot of excess. But it just seemed to be filled with too much that didn’t feel necessary; information and incidents that didn’t add any roll to the story.<br /><br />Flabby in the sense that it at times “Doctor Sleep” seemed soft and overly familiar, in a couple instances almost hackneyed,  with stuff we’ve all heard before – like the cat King names Azzie who hangs around in the nursing home and jumps onto the bed of someone who’s about to expire.<br /><br />I really got thrown out of the story when – as a too-handy plot device that for me stretched plausibility a bit – King introduced “a powerful sedative” the government’s super-secret National Security Agency had just developed that members of the True Knot managed to snatch and use to put the good guys into a nice and deep slumber whenever convenient for purposes of the narrative. For me that stretched plausibility too far<br /><br />Things like that are what caused me to call the book “flabby.”  But that’s flabby by way of comparison to other of books King has written. He is a master storyteller and rating and ranking what he writes is like comparing novels written by Charles Dickens. “Great Expectations,” is probably a better piece of story-telling than “Bleak House,” but everything Dickens wrote is praise-worthy in some shape or fashion.<br /><br />With all that said, I’ll bet you “Doctor Sleep” is still one of the best books you’re likely to read this year. It’s my opinion that it would have been an even better story had it been a little more tightly constructed, a little leaner perhaps. “Doctor Sleep” needed, it felt like to me, a ruthless editor.<br /><br />In a word: Frightfulhan “Bleak House,” but everything Dickens wrote is praise-worthy in some shape or fashion.<br /><br />With all that said, I’ll bet you “Doctor Sleep” is still one of the best books you’re likely to read this year. It’s my opinion that it would have been an even better story had it been a little more tightly constructed, a little leaner perhaps. “Doctor Sleep” needed, it felt like to me, a ruthless editor.<br /><br />In a word: Frightful
B000N2HBSO|5.0|A must read for anyone that is into Lincoln. This is one of the best researched books I have ever read. You will love it.
1742204147|5.0|This is a well-researched, detailed guide on the whole of Japan.  It covers all the regions and, of course, Tokyo and other major metro areas in a lot of detail.<br /><br />The focus is on the regional backgrounds and highlights for the typical Western tourist.  The writing is clear and I did not feel overwhelmed by the abundance of information. It's nice they include Japanese characters for place names, so one can point to them to a local and (hopefully) get some help.<br /><br />Now I hope I'll have saved enough dollars to convert to a few yen by next summer so I can travel to Japan...
B002ZG9774|5.0|I love this movie, the bluray is packed with some great features and the sound is spot on perfect. Great price too, I can't complain
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|I have yet to run in to any issues as of yet.  It does start slow. Still fun though.<br /> Filling space
B00A50PDDY|5.0|21 Pilots have a sound all their own. How can two guys, a piano, a ukelele and a sound track be sooooo good!?!
B00BG5CXGM|5.0|Spigen SGP Slim Armor case for iphone 5/5s Love it!  Fits great.  I have dropped my phone a few times and no cracks.
0790729733|1.0|This flim should begin with a legal disclaimer stating that everything in this film is conjecture.  Lacking that it should be removed from circulation as it is a very misleading hodgepoge of guesses and paranoid delusions that are taken as fact by the uninformed.
B0049VVE7Y|1.0|I really liked the 1st and only one I watched. As a prime member I thought it'd be free, but it's not. Can't see spending $2.99 + tax for each episode in HD.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great fun for all ages with a wide variety of games and skill levels. excellent to get your brain &amp; reflexes going or just relax and pass the time.
0316019984|5.0|Nothing more can be said about this incredible book. My husband's response was, &#34;Take that Kindle!&#34; With the digital age, books have really stepped up to the challenge. Luckily I have a 13 year old that loves reading, so I wasn't using this as a lure - she also loves comics - but more as a gift that I know will boggle her mind.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|So sophisticated and poignant it hardly seems YA.  I teach middle school ELA and I'm planning to use excerpts within our Holocaust unit, hopefully encouraging the students to pick up the book and read it independently.  The &#34;narrator&#34; makes the realities of that time accessible for a younger reader, while not scaring them beyond the point of understanding.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|One of the best series ever! If you are a fan of the (even if your are not) this is a no brainer. I especially love the digital copy and blu ray is 2nd to none.
B00DJ3ITKS|5.0|Very nice reading! There are several ideas that Bezos developed that could be replicated in different field. This is a must read for every retail entrepeneur.
B007DIQC90|5.0|Great Album - Thank you for helping with the original exchange of a broken disk!  Very professional!  Album is great!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this is a great game, fun and challenging. kind of like jewels with a twist.I usually cant put it down. I would recommend it to anyone
0425252868|5.0|What an incredible story!  I have encouraged three other people to read this!  It would be a great movie, but they would get it wrong.
B00FAPU0UK|5.0|This is a really fast-moving, raunchy, edgy sexual thriller which definitely got my full attention. The scenes are powerful and full of unexpected twists and turns, right up to the final page. I'd really like to know what happens next! Great entertainment, thoroughly recommended.
B008745B32|5.0|I began reading, not understanding the gravity of this book, annoyed by the action of the characters.  I have finished, feeling that I have grown up more.
B007URVZJ6|3.0|Very useful for first-timers on Kindle but lacking in-depth hints or pointers.  Book provides exactly the information in its title and no more.
B00FVVR2ZO|4.0|the game is great just as much as mystery manor it is different from other hunt and find games I have played
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|Excellent!!  Good story, great acting, and amazing special effects.  Chris Pine is wonderful, but Benedict Cumberbatch steals the show whenever he is on screen...
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I was searching for movies with Richard Gere.  When I saw Hachi, being a dog lover I decided to watch it.  It was an amazing true story of a man and his dog.  The actual story took place in Japan, while the movie was in the U.S.  This is a very touching story, which will make you laugh and cry.  Yet it leaves you with an incredibly wonderful feeling inside about the love and loyalty of dogs.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who has ever had a dog.  There is an actual statue of Hachi in Japan at the Railroad station.  I won't say more since I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone.  After watching this movie, I decided to buy it for myself.  It's one I will watch again and again.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|The title says it all, but Amazon wants me to type more stuff here. Besides the obvious, the BD has really good special features and the 3D was amazing on my plasma. Watch it now!
0618918248|5.0|Reviewer's background:<br />I was a Christian from May 30, 2003 to some time, I'd say, fall of 2011.  I had been a devout Christian doing everything I could to be the good faithful Christian.  In the last 2 years of my Christianity, however, I started to see and think differently.  When I mean different, I mean I could no longer follow the blind stupidity of many of my religious peers.  After being accused of not being a Christian for accepting anthropogenic climate change (I still don't understand that logic) and not rejecting evolution outright (which I can understand), I decided I can't really be one of &#34;them&#34;.  You wanna talk about not fitting in?  I felt alone while being surround by my friends.  Being a &#34;closet evolutionist&#34;, or should I say &#34;closet science acceptor&#34;, made life suck.  I began watching youtube videos about science, which is how I came across Richard Dawkins (I guess I'd been living in a cave).  Through these videos, online debates, and fact checking, (and reading a book on Greek mythology, oddly enough), I became what I could only call an agnostic.  In the past, I had cursed this book (never having read it).  But since I had become an agnostic, I decided to buy the book.  I loved it.  Let me be clear, I was an agnostic first, THEN bought the book (not the other way around).  I will say, however, that now I am an agnostic leaning toward atheism, as Dr. Dawkins put it.<br /><br />The Book:<br />Whether you are a Christian or not, I believe you will be intellectually stimulated.  Richard Dawkins does his best to be thorough with his reasoning, arguments, and documented examples, and I believe he does a good job.  But he also doesn't handle the reader with kid gloves; despite his obvious British politeness, if something seems incredibly stupid, he'll say its incredibly stupid.  Because of that, I felt directly challenged a couple of times (which I'm used to, and not afraid of).  Whether you end the book with your faith in-tact, or not, is irrelevant:  You will be smarter after having read this book, and have a fresh outlook on other people's beliefs.<br /><br />I liked the physical properties of the cover.  It was tough and durable, but wasn't as &#34;solid&#34; as a hard cover, but not as weak as your average paper cover books.<br /><br />Since I loved this book, I used this as a &#34;gateway&#34; book to reading books by Sam Harris.  I later plan to read other books from Dennett and Hitchens, and maybe others, in due time.  I'm in no hurry.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|Loved this book! It really made some of the Law of Attraction theories real for me. My favourite experiment was the one where we &#34;tell the universe&#34; what we want to see in our surroundings over the next few days. I asked for green cars. The very next day I was sitting on a London bus reading another book, when I felt the urge to look up. We were travelling down a small residential street, and within the space of 10 seconds I saw no less than 7 green cars parked on the sidewalk. Seven! It was amazing =)<br /><br />Only two percent of the population buys green cars. They must live on the same street LOL
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i really like this app, it is really fun fun fun fun fun.fun fun fun fun  uf. h. bb fun and really really fun
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It is very good and is keeping me wanting to read it and not put it down.  It is very good so far.
B00A3AU9KI|5.0|Belkin quality as expected - company package & works well.  Charges my iPhone quickly in the car.  I'm glad to not have to carry my cord back & forth any longer
B00DYEN6XC|5.0|Exactly what I wanted!<br /><br />I expected the figurines to be of low quality since they were freebies, but they weren't, they were very detailed and it looked really presentable on display.<br /><br />Of course, the Blu-ray is as what you would expect it. Crisp quality!
0920668372|5.0|I first heard this book as part of a Mother's Day sermon with a soloist singing the &#34;I'll like you for always....&#34; and I sniffled all through it. I had to get my own copy and every time anyone I know is expecting, I give it to them. It's the sweet story of a mother's love as her son grows and then his for her as she becomes feeble. Any Mommy will love it but....remember to keep some tissues within reach!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is an addicting, fun game of mild logic use--challenging, but not too difficult to strip away the enjoyment. I'd pay for this app!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire is the best book our of the 3.  I adore the character development and gripping plot.  This is my third time reading it, and each time is just as enthralling as the initial read.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I had read rave reviews about this book and finally bought and read it. I don't know what I was expecting but at first I found the way the story went back and forth to be annoying (sorry!). As I got into the book, I couldn't wait to get to the end to find out what the heck would happen! It is well written and original in tone and technique and that is refreshing. I will read more books by this author.
B00B49GSKC|4.0|Good movie, great cinematography and direction. The movie was definitely worth buying in my opinion, especially to fill out my collection
B00EP22QKG|4.0|Not the best that this Icon can do but more she is still so much better than most. Joan J is the original Queen of Rock & Roll and she still believes that life philosophy. I recommend this CD as an introduction for the younger generations.
B001TH16DS|4.0|There was a slight blemish on the package but other than that I was completely satisfied. I knew what I was getting knowing that it was used.
0307476073|5.0|This was a very compelling story of personal searching for identity.  The juxtaposition of the grittty physical conditions against the devil-may-care attitude left one wondering how the issues would be resolved.  The author clearly loved reading books, as she sacrificed pounds of creature comforts for volumes of books!  Our book club wondered what she would tell her own children about risky living.
0439023521|5.0|Such a good book, I borrowed this from a friend and had to return it before I could finish it. I immediately went online and bought it because I needed to own it and find out what happened! Such a good read, so is the rest of the collection. You go from loving to hating the main character and back again.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|Fun.  Other then waiting for some crops to grow you can play and advance to new levels rather quickly. Like the graphics and real farm sounds.  Easy to figure out with hints and easy to understand language.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|Of course the book was better and I agree that Jennifer Lawrence isn't really the actress that I would picture for an emaciated hunger stricken character, but she did a good job and it was fun as a fan of the book to see how they brought to life the fantasy world that the book describes. Looking forward to catching fire!
B00GLX0Z8C|2.0|I gave it two stars simply because Jennifer Aniston is in it. How can you not love a movie she plays a stripper in? Well, it's not good, that's how. The humor is all based on crude junior high body part jokes. I don't mind a few of those jokes, but when that's the only thing a movie offers in an attempt to make you laugh you have a loser. So for me it's $4.99 down the drain.
B00DHRLK84|3.0|The book was better but the movie was worth buying. I am terrified of fast moving zombies but other than that I can't complain.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Love this game and had no idea it was on Android until I signed into Amazon because I was board. Wonder why its not advertised by MTG themselves and why its not on the Android Market.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|I like the game but need lots of coins I wish it would sync with castleville on my Facebook game
B00966TN1Q|4.0|The pace is fast and packed with twists and turns. One is never completely sure of the outcome, which keeps one riveted.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|good graphics. uses energy like a lot of facebook games. I like the contract hunts that enable you to earn to upgrade your gear.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|a friend of mine plays this game so I thought I'd give it a shot. not crazy about the in-app purchases but it oz a lot of fun. higher levels are challenging.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Love Downton Abbey... .... ...... highly recommend...if amazon would not required so may works for a feedback, us extreamly busy people would leave a ***** star feedback rating more often, rather than just skip them all together
B00GHJ6BJW|4.0|This album is not as exciting as her other albums.  I love her up-beat, catchy songs that are plentiful in her previous albums, but this one is a little slower paced.  There are some great songs in the album, but just not as many as her other albums.  I was a little disappointed that Applause is by-far the best song on this album and it was the first one released as a single.  I will admit that I do like the album a little more each time I listen to it, but I didn't instantly love it like I have her others.
B007A2O3FO|4.0|fair entertainment for the priceworks great... .... ...... highly recommend...if amazon would not required so may works for a feedback, us extreamly busy people would leave a ***** star feedback rating more often, rather than just skip them all together
B000OWC2QE|5.0|I thought this a beautiful family friendly film with great facts; especially interesting was the info on larvae spawning on August 8th that is a total mystery to underwater scientists.  As the wife of the member of this account and a Johnny Depp enthusiast, I just noticed who was narrating this film...one of my favorite actors.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The best show on tv. So many characters and so many plot twists. Keeps you entertained and looking forward to the next program.
B009ZM74F8|4.0|Cool and creative concept of a movie. Action and Sci Fi. Thumbs up!<br />Not like any other movie i remember seeing.
B00F880BWG|5.0|First several episodes turned a lot of people off, including me.  Then it fell into line for another great season.  Have watched through the episode showing the return of a character from last season and now am jonesing for next Sunday.
1609611543|5.0|good book… Thought provoking… the world of vegan, non-gluten and so on can be very confusing….however the<br />author does a great job here! thank you
B003INBNXO|5.0|One of the best Films I've ever seen! Truely outstanding. Ip Man is one of the best Martial Arts films I've ever seen. Truely a Masterpiece!!!!!!!!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|It makes compete sense to me that this was what humans would do and therefore what God would plan to ensure we understand the message Jesus came to communicate to us of all ages.
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|it's a strange book and if it's true a disturbing book.  I love to read so this was just interesting
B00CDFWJIG|5.0|I read the books, and they create an interesting storyline. However, the movie adaptation is something quite different. I feel that the main characters did a good job of interpreting the general feel of the book, but overall there are too many details left out of the film that are important aspects of the &#34;Caster Universe&#34; of the B.C. book series.<br /><br />Considering the film on its own: I really liked it. The male lead is a handsome guy, generally likable, and a good fit. The scenery sets a good tone for the movie, and the storyline does not drag. I think I enjoyed it more because I already &#34;knew&#34; the characters, but I treated them more like &#34;movie counterparts&#34;, and enjoyed the film more :)<br /><br />I recommend this to the general audience. Even my 30 year old white guy husband found it generally entertaining (but I bought his ticket). If you're reading this review, go ahead and give it a try! I doubt you will be disappointed.
B000002GAF|5.0|Trip down memory lane!  Slowly replacing my vinyl with CD's. Such a lush voice! Totally evokes my high school years.
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|My sincere thanks to the casting director for finding such a handsome man to play Superman.<br /><br />I love Cristopher Reeve as superman, but Henry Cavill is also excellent. While Reeve has boyish charm and boyish looks, it seems that Cavill isn't as charming... a little more brooding. That being said he's great - Sigh - and great to look at!<br /><br />A bigger upset for me is that Lois Lane has become a bit wimpier. I much prefer the 1980's Lois played by Margot Kidder. She was abrasive and exciting character in her own right. This is not the case for Adams who is just ... there. Very conveniently, always there, in fact, for superman to scoop up. I also think that Lois Lane is better with darker hair. But that's another bone to pick.<br /><br />Zod is a badass, as is his crew. Good job Zod!<br /><br />An excellent hero film, I am anxiously awaiting a sequel :)
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|My son -Who is 14 -and all of his high school band buddies watch this movie over and over and over again. It is interesting!
B004MC0FO8|5.0|Get that awful song out of your head faster by using Shazam! Can't remember the artist? The title? No problem! Shazam is a great tool to help you expand your musical horizons.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have so much fun playing this game. I love how the levels get harder and harder! it's very addictive, I don't seem to get a lot done.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book had me on edge from the beginning.  I enjoyed the book and felt for the characters throughout the entire story.
B001J4E1D8|5.0|first off the story is fantastic! for anyone who enjoys Jane Austen I think you would really enjoy this film. the quality of this dvd is great i wish they had it on blu-ray however...
B000QE9ERK|1.0|Depp's acting was good, the story kind of thin...........I didn't understand the ending.  Did he go to hell?  Was that woman the devil?
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|One of my favorite adventure games so far. G5 really nailed it. the story line is really interesting and the graphics are beautiful. The mini games are really fun. Great pirate adventure!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Does exactly as advertised. Works great. Great replacement for the original cable that went bad. Good value for the price.
B00EMAGCJM|4.0|This album REALLY grew on me.<br />I really never liked Miley at all...especially after hearing &#34;We Can't Stop&#34; and seeing the video. But I went ahead and bought this album because everyone was talking about it, and that's when I realized, yeah she does a lot of things just for the attention, but who DOESN'T do that these days??? Very few.<br />Nevertheless I am very shocked at how this album grew on me, and how much I really do enjoy some of the songs; especially since this isn't even really my type of music.<br /><br />My favorites:<br /><br />- Wrecking Ball (10/10)<br />- My Darlin' (9.5/10) *current favorite song*<br />- Love Money Party (9/10)<br />- Someone Else (9/10)<br />- Adore You (8.5/10)<br />- Drive (8/10)<br />- Do My Thang (8/10)<br />- 4x4 (8/10) *not for everyone; really grew on me*
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Just started playing. It's good so far. It seems like you will have to spend money to get far. Another review will come later.
B006PTZNSY|5.0|Like many others have said, this album is very diverse. There really are songs for just about everyone on here.<br />I love Nicki so this review might be slightly biased, but I just love this CD.<br /><br />I can't list my top favorite songs, as I usually do for albums, because there are far too many.<br /><br />Only 2 out of the 20 songs on the album I generally skip over/don't listen to, and those are Champion, and Sex In The Lounge.<br />Champion is very slow, and I'm not a fan of the features...not to mention Nicki is barely even on the track. And Sex In The Lounge is kind of just dumb to me...it's really catchy, and I like Nicki's verse, but overall not the best song and just like Champion she is barely in it.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Great movie. You will be stuck to the screen the whole time and even jump a few times. Definitely worth watching.

B00E8TVHBA|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! It has officially become my number one favorite movie out of all the movies I have seen in my life.This movie is perfect for people who love musicals, love stories, and stories about two worlds being mysteriously brought together and they end up having fun.

B00CGZXS88|4.0|Mystery genre:  I found it a very interesting and enjoyable short story.  It was typical of  the Agatha Christie genre.
1455525839|3.0|\\"White Fire,\\" the newest offering in the Pendergast series by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child, provides an episodic interim storyline that is meant to appease its fans until the next novel that advances the character's life journey ahead with answers--or at least suggestions--to larger issues posed and developed by the earlier novels is created.  With that in mind, \\"White Fire\\" can be viewed as a bit of a tease; it mentions the enigmatic Constance, Tristram, and Lt. D'Agosta with perhaps, a bit of a hint that the next Pendergast thriller might take place at Vincent's upcoming wedding, but it doesn't move these characters ahead on any timeline towards their respective futures.  Instead it focuses on the character of Corrie Swanson, student at the John Jay School of Law Enforcement  and her decision to write a thesis based on an old story involving a group of miners that were devoured by a huge grizzly bear at the turn of the 20th century in the now ritzy ski-resort town of Roaring Fork, Denver. Despite the fun inference to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Oscar Wilde and a missing Sherlock Holmes story, \\"White Fire\\" ultimately relies on predictable plot devices and an action scene involving snow mobiles that would work better in a different type of thriller.<br /><br />Not that there has not been plenty of action in other Pendergast plots: the sequence on the island at the end of [[ASIN:0446555002 Two Graves (Pendergast)]] includes enough action to put the creators of the James Bond films to shame.  However, in this case, the action is not prompted by enough arcane knowledge revealed by either the stumbling efforts of secondary characters like D'Agosta or the staff at the Museum ([[ASIN:0812543262 Relic (Pendergast, Book 1)]], [[ASIN:0812542835 Reliquary (Pendergast, Book 2)]] scholarly study or Pendergast's vast bank of experience in the macabre annals of his odd family and the world of criminal depravity.  The connection to Conan Doyle, Wilde and Sherlock Holmes works to a degree, but the discerning reader will have already pieced most of that puzzle together before Pendergast even gets the chance to take out his magnifying glass and sleuth about.<br /><br />Along this line, most readers who enjoy the respite of engrossing themselves within the pages of a well-written thriller, will be able to figure out who the culprits are before the second third of the story begins.  None of this matters, Pendergast is still the reader's hero with his black perfectly tailored clothing, trilby hat and pale ice cold features.  Nonetheless his appearance in \\"White Fire\\" merely titillates the reader's curiosity, whetting his/her appetite for a bigger, more meaningful chunk of Pendergast. Likewise, he/she wants more detailed histories--answers to the conundrum of Constance and the open-ended parenthesis of all the other beloved characters fashioned by the Preston/Child team.<br /><br />A new character is added to the melee, Captain Stacy Bowdree, USAF.  After the sad demise of reporter Bill Smithback, hopefully this edition of a feisty, pistol-packing slightly demoralized veteran of multiple tours in Afghanistan will interject some of Smithback's trademark impulsiveness back into the stories.<br /><br />Bottom line?  \\"White Fire\\" is an okay addition to the Pendergast series of thrillers by the writing team of Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child. Focusing mainly on secondary character, Corrie Swanson and her adventure in Roaring Fork, CO, the reader enjoys Pendergast coming to the rescue and using his Sherlockian aptitude to puzzle out yet another disturbing crime in a repertoire fit for its own cabinet of curiosities. Recommended for die-hard Pendergast fans with the caveat that \\"White Fire\\" is most likely intended as an episodic filler to hold the readers until the next time.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />\\"reneofc\\"a degree, but the discerning reader will have already pieced most of that puzzle together before Pendergast even gets the chance to take out his magnifying glass and sleuth about.<br /><br />Along this line, most readers who enjoy the respite of engrossing themselves within the pages of a well-written thriller, will be able to figure out who the culprits are before the second third of the story begins.

B004W2UBYW|4.0|Book was very interesting throughout although sometimes difficult to follow due to the large number of persons involved. Being close to the same age as Jobs made the book more interesting for me. Good book for anyone who enjoys historic accounts of interesting people and events. It's a shame Jobs died so young.
B00CR1DX9A|4.0|Very funny. A well written farce that only slips into silly a few (well done) times. And you don't need to know anything about British politics to enjoy it.
B000ZMVAXO|5.0|great crunch!  Between the guitar tone and the tone/gain knobs on this, I can get the sounds I want.  The only drawback is that there's no reverb, but what do you expect from something this tiny at this price?
B008JFUR10|3.0|I know this is a common refrain but this does bring back memories of the cheesy monster movies of the cold war era.  I see Mothra, Rodan and of course Godzilla in several of the monsters in this movie.  The idea of brawling with mechanical soldiers is cool and well done.  We get to see the good guys lose which is inspired for a monster movie. I also like how this movie is not American-centric.  The climatic scene set in Hong Kong is wonderful and it does not let facts ruin a good story.<br /><br />Otherwise the movie has terrible character development and a plot riddled with facts and detail that is nearly impossible to follow. It is just big and dumb and next to impossible to follow if you try.  The acting is wooden and from the most stock of stock actors.<br /><br />Again this is just a big dumb movie.  If you turn your brain off you can enjoy the cool monsters and machines but don't expect too much!
B004QIG7CW|5.0|We enjoyed seeing this on our family Disney vacation.  It has good memories associated with it.  The kids love the music.
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|Great game, challenging, but not too much, enjoyed playing it, good hint set-up in case you are get stuck, and nice graphics
B00ECR7KX2|5.0|Got this in a regular DVD stead of Blu-Ray. No significant difference for my older eyes.<br /><br />Saw this at the cinema. Good price. Fast arrival. Blah. Blah.<br /><br />Kenneth Branagh's version much better. But this ain't no second rate production. B&W adds some mystery.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|For a simple app it's very well done and easy to use. Nice feature that you are able to dim the screen by simply sliding your finger up and down the screen.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Solid entertainment. Of course it is ridiculous. Who cares. It gets it done in fine fashion.<br /><br />There is absolutely no biological science or sense to this silly stuff.<br /><br />Am a Walking Dead addict.  God Bless Herschel Greene. And thank god for Herschel's peg leg. A transportation technological triumph. Man that is technology.<br /><br />It is Cugat.
B0094LYBT2|5.0|Acting...3 stars. The Message...5 stars. The topics and relevance of this movie are enduring,powerful, and a &#34;must see&#34; for any 'guy' who wants to know what is required to be a man, a father, and &#34;a man of God&#34;.
1400069289|5.0|This book was highly readable, and I learned a lot about why we do what we do.  Some non-fiction books are difficult to plow through, but not this one.  It was fascinating.  I would recommend it to everyone.

B001NZ3DY6|3.0|I just got this for fun. It has some filler songs that all sound the same, but does give you the few hits that your looking for.
0345803507|1.0|a trilogy of books that should never have been published or made this book series is lame and boring nothing happens plus it was once twilight fan fiction before it got published but this book trilogy should never have been published to begin with and plus e l james is terrible role model for women another terrible role model for women is stephenie meyer do not buy books by either one of these authors they do not know how to write books at all trust me i know this
B002F6FQGK|4.0|I like this album. It has grown on me more and more. I am interested to hear more from them. There is some redunancy but I found that more often with CD's that try to cram too much music onto one album. I would rather have 5 great songs than 12 &#34;ok&#34; ones.
B002FOQY2M|5.0|This album is even better than FUNs newer album, &#34;Some Nights&#34;. It's great! I just wish Fueled by Ramen was the same as it used to be and they would find bands to make more stuff like this!
B000VWSINI|5.0|Great hits album. I own some Eminem but didn't have all of these songs. If you just want something that has a bunch of great songs on it, this is it.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game is very fun. I like that you can earn coins for in app purchases.  Fun levels and vehicles.

B009LQKHIO|5.0|This book highlights the very best of what it means to be human.  Megan Kimble and Todd Jordan have both suffered the loss of someone close to them.  Megan, broken and scared, has brought hope to Todd.  You see them picking themselves up by their bootstraps and making the necessary changes in their life to achieve a better, happier life.
B008MM9630|1.0|There is little &#34;fairy magic&#34; about this game. In my opinion, poor graphics and an overly simple farm theme combine to make this a waste of time.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|this app is a fun time killer that is fun when you make allies early on. though it has some bad multilplayer matching
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|this is the best app I have ever tryed in my whole life<br />becuase it has sensing and more cool stuff u should really try its awesome.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a roller coaster ride of a book.  The twists in the plot made this an exciting read.  I would recommend this book to anyone that likes face paced suspense thrillers.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|I love dance and I love satire. This video provided both. The Australians seem to have a clever way with language and a keen insight into people who take themselves to seriously.
B004N6369Y|1.0|This is book is awful. What's the story? Everyone is so positive and happy and there's no conflict. The rooms are clean. The daughter lets a homeless man sleep in a room and nothing happens. She's busy in school. She can travel.<br /><br />Why even tell us about her mother? The mother is another dull character. Wow - she has tattoos and two kids w/a rock star. Now what? There's no emotion. And the daughter never tells her father about the drug use? Why does the daughter sheild her mother's terrible behavior from the dad? Who gives a hoot?<br /><br />And there's the spineless father who is afraid to tell his ADULT kid he's dating. WHAT?<br /><br />Yeah, I borrowed the book on cd from the library. I'm on disk 4 and it's unimaginably dull.<br /><br />AND, the narrator (reader) is awful. Sounds like he practiced all the French words separately, recored them at another time, and the French words were &#34;inserted&#34; where they belong during another recording session. He's a dull reader. Goodness.<br /><br />I've NEVER read her books before, and I tell you now, I'll never ever pick up another Danielle Steel book as long as I live.
B009P3N1GI|5.0|Short story or not, this book is a full story in itself, again intriqueing magic system, awesome characters and the plot worthy of Sanderson fame.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Totally addicted and can't wait for more!!!! Have read the books and watched the HBO series. Can't wait for more of both!!!
B00FRQ32N4|1.0|wont download on my kindle I deleted all my games wont DOWNLOAD so yeah it just wont download if.someone would help me
0316044938|3.0|Without ruining the end, all I have to say is the book was definitely different than I thought it was going to be. It certainly wasn't bad, but it wasn't better than I was hoping for.
B001BANK32|5.0|If you love the movie, you'll LOVE this novel. The novel is more scary than the movie ever thought about being. Awesome.
0307389839|4.0|Loosely constructed musings about the relationship of running to writing, full of Murakami gems and philosophical asides, all related in a deceptively simple style.
6305428352|5.0|Having read some of the other reviews for this movie make me sad.....sad for those that don't get it..... and those that are unable to be lifted by tis movie's spectacular ending. Sure.....it has some plot weaknesses....but what movie doesn't?<br />I have viewed this movie more than ten times.....and know all the story turns. Even with that......I find Mr. Holland's Opus to be one of most entertaining movies ever made.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|It was an excellent read, that left me wondering what would happen next on every page. Sanderson has done it again.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|works as stated was very easy to hook up and use. just make sure you have a good wifi connection and you will have no problems
B008XK69S6|1.0|Goes through the motions but doesn't deliver. Nice GUI but I need is actual functionality. Its automation couldn't find any music on my Kindle Fire nor could I direct it to where the mp3 files are stored. If there is a way to do that, it's not readily apparent. Seems like all flash and no substance to me.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Well done drama that give us unfamiliar with that culture and lifestyle what it might have been like back then.
B000X2H8G4|5.0|I am a Rehab Director in a skilled nursing facility and my staff and I absolutely LOVE the SuperEar Personal Sound Amplifier.<br /><br />In working with the older adult population, we find that many patients with hearing loss struggle to process medical information- not because they can't understand, but because they can't hear! I know that this device is NOT a replacement for personally fitted hearing aids, but it is a godsend for communicating with people that either do not own hearing aids or do not wear their hearing aids for a variety of reasons.<br />Before the SuperEar, our patients would struggle to hear during Physical, Occupational, and Speech therapy.  Therapists would strain their voices to be heard. After purchasing and using the SuperEar with a variety of patients and therapists, patients are happier, my staff is begging me to order more, and families of our patients are wondering where they can buy this product!
B001NOQI3U|4.0|So corny in many respects… But what's not to like about a cross-dressing romance film about Judaism starring Barbara Streisand and young, very sexy Mandy Patinkin?
0385340990|5.0|It's an interesting book.  It holds your attention from beginning to end.  It's well worth purchasing and sharng with others.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|All the melodrama! What a guilty pleasure.  So many characters you love to hate and hate to love.  Who will they kill off next???
B00F91RYL8|1.0|Just another Zombie movie. And BTW - Philly sure looks a lot like Glasgow!!! Nothing but special affects and not much of a plot.
B00915G6WQ|2.0|I have loved watching Dexter from the beginning, but this season kind of annoyed me.  I found the Hannah character morally repugnant and really could not find Dexter's feelings for her at all plausible.  They struck me as evidence of a clear and certain moral turpitude in Dexter that moved the series out of a region of moral ambiguity I could find interesting.  Some time after season 4 or 5 Dexter stopped being someone I could hope to find redemption in, and in season 7 it actually became hard to watch.  Most painful was Deb' s loss of vitality.  Throughout season 7 her character was tragic and lost.  I don't plan to watch season 8.<br /><br />NEXT DAY:  okay well I decided since I wasn't going to buy Season 8 I might as well read ahead about what happens in it.  Having done that, I realized that the series is for the most part a tragedy, particularly for the character Deb Morgan.  Rather than rooting for Dexter Morgan, I am now rooting against him, and have decided to watch Season 8.  I might or might not feel moved to change my review on Season 7 after I've finished Season 8.
B00F35BV64|2.0|After the first one with this group I found this one to be disappointing. I was expecting much more. Maybe next time???
B009CG29RK|5.0|I just love this movie!  Great for adults and children in my eyes.  I had to buy this one instead of rent :) I have watched it more than once!
B003B02O0A|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. I could easily understand all the characters, and found that they all described the &#34;hometown&#34; atmosphere.  Makes me want to go there to visit the restaurant and clientelle.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Love this cd.  Have at least 4 hits on it.  Plus, had to buy it for the song &#34;Treasure&#34;,  cause that is my name :)
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|this game is addictive and is so enjoyable to play. you don't get tired because the game board is always changing.
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|Unbelievable story with great suspense.  Good performances by all, especially Affleck.  I don't agree however that it should have won the Oscar.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|Well, since this is the only dictionary, I guess it's alright but I didn't really get a chance to use it before I had to rate it.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|The ending was VERY DISAPPOINTING! But still pretty good read. Personally Veronica Roth should've ended the series in book number 2.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book, loved the entire series. Seriously worth reading you'll love everything about it. Don't watch the movie if you haven't read the books!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Veronica Roth didn't wimp out - she kept true to the characters and ended the book the way it should end. Only thing that seemed out of place was the shift of voices in the third novel. If it was a good thing to tell the story from the point of view of each character for each chapter, she should have used that literay device throughout the entire trilogy. That being said, my 7th grade students and I are still talking about the ending!
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This movie is a classic. And perfect for all year round viewing, however, Christmas time is always fitting. I'd recommend it!
B005COO1X6|5.0|Again SK delivers a page turner! Loved it!  From a long time fan. Write some more singles! They are great.
B0044DEAUA|4.0|Works well, was easy to set up. I wish the volume could go louder. I find myself leaning toward the speaker to hear better once the volume is all the way up.<br /><br />I does the job and I like the push button to turn on Siri to make a call, read a text message, etc.

B0034DGPEU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It is a fascinating and sometimes disturbing story.  I have no doubt that though this is a work of fiction, many of these things actually happened on some plantations.
B00EW9GQR6|3.0|In case anyone here is interested, I chose to buy this album first over Katy Perry's &#34;Prism&#34; which I just purchased recently. The main reason there was that I was more interested in &#34;Applause&#34; over the slightly disappointing &#34;Roar.&#34; It was also kinda cool that I got the rare silver foil copy of &#34;ARTPOP&#34; too but that's a story for another time. Both of those tracks are far from my favorite tracks from both &#34;ARTPOP&#34; & &#34;Prism&#34; & it was a plus for both them & myself having them on SNL. My main reason for buying Katy Perry's album was/is &#34;Walking On Air&#34; which she performed on the show along with (even though I got &#34;ARTPOP&#34; ahead of time) having Lady Gaga perform &#34;Do What U Want&#34; on SNL too. I now recommend purchasing both but &#34;Do What U Want&#34; when it comes down to it...lol.
B00006F2WY|4.0|As an avid Purple fan from their first album through about &#34;Come Taste The Band,&#34; I found this recording interesting.  I had bought it in vinyl back when it was first released about 1970.  That copy was worn out a long time ago.  So it was nice to get a new copy.  Is it great classical music?  No.  Is it a great rock album?  Also, No.  But it is any interesting piece.  The idea of &#34;Classical Rock&#34; that integrated classical and rock music has been used by many groups and performers such as Moody Blues, King Crimson, Yes, and EL&P.  But this album took the concept to much more of the extreme as Jon Lord really attempted to write a classical music composition first with the rock group integrated.  If you're expecting a album anything like the previously mentioned groups normally recorded in the late 60's or early 70's, you will probably be disappointed.  If you're a bit more open, you will possibly find this album interesting.  Be forewarned though that is a live recording in a concert hall so don't expect state-of-the-art sound quality.  The additionally cuts not on the original album are nice but don't really add anything.
B00ERIUO02|3.0|You see, obviously Katy Perry & Lady Gaga both put out new albums at nearly the same time. I got a better feeling from & quite simply thought that &#34;applause&#34; by Lady Gaga was worlds better than Katy Perry's latest hit &#34;Roar&#34;, yet I was still interested in what else the album might offer, therefore I kept an open mind on it. I was quite excited about getting the new Lady Gaga album (which I did, by the way get with the rare silver foil), yet I'm still letting &#34;ARTPOP&#34; grow on me just like I expect &#34;Prism&#34; to do.<br /><br />Considering both artists 1st hits, it was great having them perform on SNL. &#34;Applause&#34; got me interested enough to buy Lady Gaga's album first, but I demanded more & actually got it. &#34;Roar&#34; was kind of disappointing for me though at 1st glance. As far as SNL goes though, both Katy Perry & Lady Gaga performed songs that REALLY got interested in them & those songs were &#34;Walking On Air&#34; & &#34;Do What U Want.&#34; Quite honestly, &#34;Walking On Air&#34; is/was the key reason why I chose to purchase &#34;Prism.&#34; Period! &#34;Do What U Want&#34; with that...lol.
B003INJETO|5.0|Love the music, can be sneaky and sly or quietly beautiful.  Lead singer can rock a mean falsetto then roar with the best.  The more you listen to it, the better it gets.
0805053883|2.0|The book was a lot more worn than the seller let on. The binding was all frayed at the top. I was disappointed in what I got.
B00GHJ6BJW|1.0|flop artpop, this chick just gets worse and worse...25 million dollar waste....LOL way to go caca for releasing such TRASH.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|My daughter is a Star Wars geek, so even though we had all the movies on blue-ray and DVD, I got her this for her birthday. I'm enjoying the heck out of it! The extras are well worth the price for me - 3 discs of extras. We're loving it. I read the negative comments and need to say, get a life. The only problem I had with the changes Lucas made were at the end of Jedi. I hate the he took out old Anakin and put in new young (and highly annoying) Anakin.<br />But for all the extras you get on this boxed set, It's okay. I'll probably watch the DVD of the original when it comes time to pop in Jedi.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I have a lot of fun sitting down at night and playing this before bed.  It starts off easy until you get the hang of it, then it starts to get even more fun as you start to learn what to look for as it gets more challenging!  I would have rated it 5 stars but you only get a certain number of lives before the game locks you out for 10-20 minutes.  You can, of course, purchase lives for the low-low price of $0.99 a shot... but I'm not prepared to drop $40 a month on the game.  All in all, great idea, great game... just too much soliciting of add-ons.
1451627297|3.0|I'm sort of a fan, coming and going, as soon as I love him he writes and writes and writes. The same story could have been more interesting by saving a few trees, if you know what I mean. He spends so much time in the character's head remembering things that he gets temporarily sidetracked from the story every five pages or so.
B00G6ZTM3Y|4.0|Primarily, this game is great. It has many more blocks than minecraft pe, actual bosses, and man more exciting features for kids and adults to enjoy. I Believe any fan of resource-gathering exploration games should definitely try and get addicted to this game. It is a great game to burn time, and once you get the hang of it, you'll master it.

B009LDD1X0|5.0|The Big Bang Theory is my favorite comedy series currently on television. The Big Bang Theory has an excellent ensemble cast and great writing. I also like the way the writers utilize the ensemble cast so that they are all given storylines and their own individual quirks. Season 6 is the pay off season in terms of Leonard and Penny's relationship finally growing. I enjoy watching the evening broadcast of previous episodes as well as watching Season 7 on CBS. We could all use a daily dose of laughter. Enjoy!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoyed the puzzles and the challenges! Clever puzzles that make you think to solve them! I am looking forward to more.
B00AF82WTO|5.0|This is the version of Persuasion that I love best. I also have the version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. I bought the version with Ciaran Hinds because I loved The Mayor of Casterbridge so much. The 2008 version of Persuasion is much more charismatic. I also enjoy Alice Krige as an actress so that was a bonus.
B004CEUEWE|4.0|I order the movie a couple of years ago and I really like all the actors and storyline for this movie. It had romance also a lot of action and it only didn't cost that much. I saw it on amazon. I had it for 24 hours which I liked in case I wanted to see it again.
B0042816YK|1.0|The image is not good, when I tried to watch it didn't work.  I opened it so I think I can't return it.
B003XCVQ3C|1.0|I had the same experience as Daniel E. Peck. It worked for a year or so. First it started failing in detecting the TV's speakers. Thus, the tv showed my mac's desktop but the sound came in the computer speakers. On reconnection worked half of the times. But a few weeks ago the image started failing too. Now I have to twist it a little bit to the right then a little to the left, tap the table and cross fingers... If you review other HDMI adapters you will find that the price in this one is outrageous. Just before writing this review I bought the BlueRigger Premium Mini DisplayPort to HDMI Male to Female Adaptor Cable also sold by Amazon by less than half of the price of this product.
B00CHILW64|5.0|This movie provides the viewer with a realistic enactment of what one family in particularly went through as well as all the others indirectly during the horrible tsunami that came without warning. It helps you to experience the fear and hopelessness this family endured through it all. We give it five stars.

B00CEF014E|5.0|Seldom do we find a book where the blurb looks like a spoiler. Finishing one third of the book, I was under the notion that Dana Barnes was definitely hallucinating about her boyfriend Tyler as mentioned in the blurb. I had lost interest but with the advent of the 5th chapter, I was in for a big surprise. Every character in this novella has a well defined character sketch and a definite motive for the way he/ she is or has projected themselves.<br /> The adventure lover in me was served with a sumptuous bouquet of twists and turns which left me aghast. It’s a must read for every adventure/ thriller lover - basically anyone who loves books must read this. You will be in for a treat and will definitely laud the author for such a laudable writing.<br />Three Cheers to you Damian for treating us with a great read.
B008GANNIC|4.0|This is a great album. Great new songs. They went back to their roots but I prefer their older music albums.
0393338827|5.0|This is Michael Lewis at his best. Like several of his books, he takes a rather mundane topic and makes it interesting by focusing on the people - not the subject. If you enjoyed any of his other books, you will certainly enjoy this one.
B007V4LBLU|5.0|A very nice movie telling a tale about heroin addicts and the state of edinburgh in the late 80s...good acting by all the characters..
B008Y5OWMK|4.0|Based on what occurred during Johnson County War of 1892 (although it is hardly factual), \\"Heaven's Gate\\" features stunning photography and strong performances. When the film was initially released it bankrupt United Artists going over budget and failing to recoup its cost and faced nasty critical barbs which seemed directed more at director Cimino (and the fact that the film went over budget) and the disappointed expectations of critics rather than the film itself.<br /><br />While \\"Heaven's Gate\\" IS flawed (in my opinion the second act could have been trimmed as the momentum achieved during the first act comes to a glacial crawl), it truly remains a visionary western influenced as much by European film directors like Visconti or David Lean (the critical reaction to \\"Heaven's Gate\\" in Europe remained positive and that's where the film gained stature initially over the years)as John Ford with elements of Ford's westerns thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />Kris Kristofferson plays a sheriff James Averill who was born into wealth but seeks justice for the immigrants that are settling in Wyoming. The immigrants are being forced from their land by wealthy cattle barons led by Frank Canton (Sam Waterston in a deliciously evil portrayal) and enforced by Averill's friend Nate Campion (Christopher Walken). Campion is also Averill's rival for the affection of madam Ella Watson (Isabelle Huppert). Watson is on Canton's hit list that he and his cronies have put together and Averill must prevent her from being murdered along with over 100 other immigrants in the region.<br /><br />I should warn you that even when the narrative for \\"Heaven's Gate\\" is moving, it has the lanquid pace. If you're expecting a quick action movie, you will be in for a disappointment but, if you are drawn into the universe that Cimino and his director of photography Vilmos Zsigmond have created with their cast and crew, you'll enjoy the movie. The 216 minute cut of the film has a narrative is much clearer than the 149 minute version that was cut for the short lived theatrical distribution of the film back in 1980.<br /><br />Criterion has done a superb job of restoring Cimino's original 216 minute cut of the film. Unfortunately, the original negative was cut and the trims discarded so Criterion had to work with the YCM color separations for the film. Usually transfers are done from interpositives but, as the original intact 216 minute negative no longer exists, it's not possible to strike a new interpositive from the negative for this version.In spite of this problem, Criterion has managed to assemble a terrific looking version of the film. There are some flaws evidence due to the source but these are relatively minor flaws.<br /><br />The 5.1 mix isn't quite as immersive as a contemporary mix but it sounds quite good.<br /><br />The special features are top notch as well although I do wish that Criterion had included the documentary made on the problems surrounding the film. Those problems aren't really addressed in depth anywhere in the special features on the disc but they are acknowledged and addressed (to a degree) in the extension booklet with the essay by Giulia D'Agnolo. We also get a 1980 interview with Cimino that discusses the technical challenges of making the film.<br /><br />The second disc features all the special features. We get a new illustrated audio interview with director Cimino and the producer of the film Joann Carelli. There are also new and in depth interviews with Kristofferson, music arranger (and performer) David Mansfield (who also appears in the film) and comments from the assistant director Michael Stevenson.<br /><br />Finally the special features are rounded out with a restoration demonstration, the teaser and theatrical trailer for the film.<br /><br />Brutally attacked when it was released back in 1980, time has restored luster to the film removing the circumstances of the difficult birth of \\"Heaven's Gate\\". While the production cost over runs, difficult egos and expectations of the film cost the studio that financed it, damaged the career of director Cimino and its reception when released, this Blu-ray allows a critical reassessment which is much deserved. Be aware, however, that \\"Heaven's Gate\\" isn't a fast paced revisionist western like \\"Unforgiven\\" or Leone's 1960's films.<br /><br />Recommendedon cost over runs, difficult egos and expectations of the film cost the studio that financed it, damaged the career of director Cimino and its reception when released, this Blu-ray allows a critical reassessment which is much deserved.

B00003CXB7|5.0|The great movie that the blockbuster series was based upon...this is where we first met Hawkeye, Trapper John, Radar, Hot Lips, Klinger, and Major Burns. I always liked the part where Hawkeye and Trapper had to &#34;sword fight&#34; their way into the hospital, with their golf umbrellas. And, once in, the way they handled the feisty head nurse.
B00E9ZATJO|1.0|Amazon's and Disney's own descriptions of the different formats are thoroughly confusing and completely unhelpful.<br /><br />There are EIGHT (8) different versions !  What are the differences?!<br /><br />I found a website that may help:<br />[...]<br /><br />But since it's unofficial, there's a chance it's wrong.  But it's better than Amazon & Disney's lack of explanation.
B00003CXAA|5.0|This is an absolute classic; it's all here, re-mastered, crystal clear and rock solid. The fourth disc fills in a lot of the questions that were unanswered in the versions released as movies. I especially liked seeing Fabrizzio get his.
B001BANK32|5.0|I first read the Shining over 30 years ago when I first started my Stephen King obsession.  When I heard about the sequel coming out, I decided to skim through the Shining again just to refresh my memory.  To my surprise and pleasure, I couldn't put it down.  Not only did I read every word, but it was just as scary and suspenseful!  Can't wait to read the sequel!!
B00F880BWG|3.0|This season has no where near the edge-of-your-seat drama that I'm used to. Oh well, good things never last long.  I'll still watch (and PAY FOR IT) even though I have a feeling this great show has seen its peak.  So sad...

B0053O8ARI|4.0|This a fun and refreshing update on the old &#34;Odd Couple&#34; plotline.  Both actresses shine in what are truly boundary-breaking roles.  Great character development at a slow but steady pace with jokes and snarky comebacks that rise naturally out of the situation the girls find themselves in.  The three recurring male characters are, at first take, stereotypical cardboard cut-outs but it soon becomes apparent that the girls are sincerely fond of them; the two-dimensional quality is merely the writers reversing a decades old practice of male writers treating women the exact same way.<br />Highly recommended.
B007FG9LIE|2.0|Could not get into it. Got around 45% before I finally decided I'm glad I did not purchase it but borrowed it. In some horror stories and films you are greeted with some characters that just act stupid and you accept it as its fodder and part of the genre. Well this is similar except it's rampant on every page where the main character acts just plain stupid - then you meet others who you would hope would be the Calvary or throw some normality in it but who also act stupid. It's so frustrating that I can't finish the book. So while it may be a great or satisfactory read for others, I just couldn't buy into it. Who knows? Maybe it all came together in the end - bummer I'm not interested in finding out.
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|I cannot recommend this movie enough. It's a witty, beautifully realized, and wonderfully 90's to boot. The heroine is independent and strong, the prince is an arrogant jackhole, and their chemistry on-screen is great to watch.

B003WKOU0G|5.0|Make no mistake:  this is a great film about 4 babies growing up in 2 different urban environments (San Francisco and Tokyo) and 2 developing countries (Namibia and Mongolia).  The rural babies' stories are especially interesting -- happy with very little in the way of material possessions, entertained largely by each other and the communities' animals -- wonderfully entertaining.

B00AAQRNQ8|3.0|The day i got this Mouse the middle mouse double clicks instead of a single click so playing any COD game on the PC is difficult because you cant press and hold in the middle mouse without throwing your grenade or weapon. ~Edit I emailed Anker and they sent me a new one after 4 days and i received the item 4 days later it had no issues with the middle mouse. ~Update 5/2/2015  I have used the replacement for quite some time now. But it seems like the middle mouse button is having issues again, every 50 or so middle mouse clicks there would be an issue where it would double click. This is quite noticeable if you open up new tabs with the middle mouse button click. Also I have noticed that this mouse has very very bad mouse acceleration. I started playing competitive counter strike global offensive, I always try to use the AWP (sniper) in the game and would try to flick shoot another player but it would not be constant. Something that my friends razer Death Adder does a great job on. I have set the windows sensitivity at 6/11 running 800 dpi. And turned all the mouse acc off in game and using the Anker gaming drivers. (and the windows acc off). I think this might be a sensor issue with this type of mouse and would no longer use it for playing &#34;High Precision&#34; games like CS GO. I am rating this at 3 stars because this mouse feels quite good in the hand has great buttons. But you cannot use this for high precision games like CS.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Perfect game for your minecraft fan. They can play on the go. My daughter has autism and this game is her special interest. It's much cheaper than the xbox version and it's fun on the go. It's so much easier for her to manipulate this version than online. The 5 year old to the 15 year old play this.
B007T8BYWE|5.0|It's addicting but better than most puzzles.  Great way to relax with a good puzzle.  Thank for making it available for free!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Confusing but sexy its a whole differwnt world makes u qonder what it would be like in the story at the end its juat creepy cause Jack her editor is some bad guy out to get revenge on Christian.
B00FOWX6NM|1.0|I returned this piece of crap, to loose color not good as showing I order another one it was more money but the new one is great all my friends love it and it fit perfect.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|The game itself is fun to play, I'll give it that. The in-app purchases ruin the game play, so it's definitely NOT worth your time. If you don't make a purchase to further your game, and you fail to complete a level a couple of times, a time clock appears and makes you wait 15 to 20 minutes to try the level again. Yes, that's right...you CAN'T play any further without buying a booster or waiting the allotted time. Also, you will get to a level without enough moves given to pass it without, you guessed it, an in-app purchase. This makes the game LAME! Not only will I delete it, but I won't be purchasing any other games from King.com . There are too many other choices for match 3 games that don't use these tactics.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|It's great for traveling - it's light and easy to carry.  But I still like to turn the pages of a book.
B0090SI4LU|5.0|Great story line, Just enough suspense. Read the book and the movie is a Keeper. Helps us all to remember why America is great.  We started and we don't give up.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is a lot of fun.  Hard to quit playing it.  I recommend it for everyone. I  love it.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A very good read and very different from the previous Hosseini book that I read. It is a series of short stories related in loss and acceptance. I found it very interesting and the writing is terrific!
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|GAME would be much better if the timer for food creation and quest did not take so long. The times for creation are ridiculous and would keep plenty of people from coming back to play on a regular basis.
0060936223|5.0|I am always fascinated by biographies, although this is my first contemporary one to read and I found it fascinating. I don't remember much about Patti Smith or the era but with this book, I learned a lot and I enjoyed learning so much on a first-hand basis.<br /><br />Patti Smith is an American artist who shares her relationship with photographer Robert Mapplethorpe in1960s New York City. Its a very honest book of two souls struggling to find their way, their art during this time in this country.
B00FPH3YQA|3.0|This movie was funny, but not as funny as the rest, if not for Zach Galifianakis I wouldn't even give it a 3, the funniest part is at the end...but cover the eyes of small fries if they are watching...like the other 2 movies not for kids...with all that said it was still an ok movie
1416550550|5.0|A wonderful story with its own twists and turns about a family and a young woman who discovers a new life for herself. I enjoyed this from start to finish and found it hard to put down.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|Sound quality is very good for such an inexpensive microphone. I would give it five stars but there is no on-off light so I have done a couple of interviews where I forgot to turn the mike on. Operator error to be sure but a little red light would have been nice to have. Also getting the battery out to replace it is difficult.
1400052181|5.0|I found this an endlessly fascinating book about the times, medicine and one woman's family. I couldn't put it down. There is much for anyone to learn from this story.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is very entertaining. Once you start playing you can't stop. Fun for all ages,I would definitely recommend this game to my friends.
B00E4Q70SQ|5.0|He did it again! Beautiful lyrics, fun catchy songs and what a unique voice. Make sure you buy the Deluxe Version. The 3 bonus tracks are outstanding. He's even more impressive in a live performance!
1476733953|5.0|I bought this many months ago. Finally got around to reading it. I was blown away! I could not believe how good it was. Believe the hype! I recommend NOT starting this book until you have enough time to finish it. You will not be able to put it down! One of the best books that I have read in a long time. Genre is post apocolyptic dystopian. If you liked Hunger Games, you will like Wool. But the plot has many more layers making it a much more satisfying read. Makes Hunger Games seem one-dimentional. Highly recommended!<br /><br />HINT: There are *two* sequels to this book! I highly recommend the entire trilogy!
1423141997|4.0|My son liked the book.  Came in good condition.  Ordered it, and had to wait for it to be released.  One day just showed up in my house.  I loved it.
B0049H9NVW|5.0|So adorable and fun to play.  Very easy to learn, as well.  I've only played it so far with my 30 yr old friends, but I imagine this game would also be good for kids.<br /><br />Be careful with the panda figurine though.  A little delicate.  I accidentally broke off one of his little ears and almost threw it away thinking it was a sesame seed!
B0097VS7ZS|5.0|i bought this because my &#34;grands&#34; were coming to visit.  I just handed my &#34;fire&#34; to the 5 year old and he played with it for over 2 hours, never asking for &#34;cartoons&#34; on the TV (which I never turned on)  great!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Really didn't think it was going to end like that. Major points for that. The writing on the other hand... Meh. I have read much better fanfiction.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great game! works your brain! challenging, yet addicting. wish there were mord than 10 levels, though. definitely worth playing even though it is so short
B001BANK32|5.0|One of the best. I'm not a huge Steven King fan, but this is just a masterpiece. Who doesn't like a suspenseful ghost story?
B00BD99JMW|2.0|The book was totally rushed and she was forced into writing and she didn't have time to finish it completly. it wasn't that good of a closure for the series can't wait for the movie though.<br />:)
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I was surprised to enjoy this, because I am not a huge Tina Fey fan. She is funnier in print than I would have thought. Playful, self-mocking, and gutsy.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Holy Bible( KJV)<br /><br />The Word of God is the absolute truth that everyone should have and hold on to.It's easy read . I love it
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|used this to turn my 27&#34; monitor into a netflix-in-the-bedroom machine! works awesome with my droid razr maxx and a nexus 7 tablet. easy to set up and use.<br /><br />my only gripe is that you cannot push photos to it. maybe you can make a slideshow and push something to it? like if you rendered it into an mp4 or something? not sure. havent tried it.<br /><br />needs to be integrated with amazon prime. oh wait, amazon needs to make a video player for android!
B008YKGQR4|2.0|Can't take all the ads across the bottom and I can't find a way to uninstall by going to the app.
B00FEJHPRI|5.0|Fun for all ages, I usually dont like Superhero stuff<br />Very good Movie well done one two three four five
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Do not play this unless you have lots of free time........<br />Great App, No Advertisements.  Still, some cadging for money, to axcellerate your game.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I really like this game, but why did you make it so hard? I hate it when you get stuck on a board for weeks and weeks!
B00BEIYMTW|5.0|Just received yesterday and we've already watched it twice.  My son loves this movie.  I love this movie.  Makes me feel like a kid again.
B00F87ZUYG|3.0|The actor playing the Govenor, lacks conviction for me as a representative of evil, unlike the Swede in Hell On Wheels. One hour of the Govenor was a lot. How did that family exist 2 years now?, with out knowing how to kill a Zombie?<br />Let Carol kill the Goveno/Ben and get back to prison.<br />Doug
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I like to play as the pigs like bad piggys.<br />so buy it it s cool fun. roofed my piggy's.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|while it works great for youtube, very other applications accept it. It claims to work with Hulu but requires Hulu+ to work, if that's the case, the most TVs with apps can download Hulu+ directly.<br /><br />It also doesn't work well with casting browser and/or full screen.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Small, easy to carry, easy to use. Good for a bug out bag or to just carry with you every day.
B004LROUNG|3.0|Quirky characters, funny scenarios, lots of courtroom action that eventually wears thin?<br />Knot tying at the end becomes tedious with a main character so altruistic he borders on unbelievable.<br />Still it does offer an interesting look at lawsuits, politicians and back room negotiations. That alone was worth the read.
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|Loved this movie!! It's well directed and keeps you wondering and quessing right up to the end. The acting was excellent and it was well directed, very entertaining.
B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|Brilliant and fascinating.  I am simply amazed at Peter Jackson and company's genius.  Film at it's storytelling best.  Special features are super!!
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|The app is great and fun. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the robot &quot;blacktop&quot; is described as &quot;the robot out of h*ll.&quot; Furthermore, the app is for tweens.
B00GBCMW9S|3.0|From a die hard Eminem fan that has every underground album and compilation he has ever been featured in, I think this album is pretty good, it is far from his best work though.  If you are a long time Eminem fan you will find things here you like and probably a few tunes that just don't fit.  I think overall Recovery was an amazing return to the old Em that I grew up listening to and I was excited enough to buy this album day one.  It is worth a buy at around the five dollar price point, but anything more than that and I would consider it over priced.  There are some songs that are clearly on here to sell records.  There is one amazing sleeper, Headlights, that really grew on me, and then there are a few tracks that sound like he was interested in making this album instead of just fulfilling an obligation to a record company.  Seriously lacking in the instrumental department and suffers overall from the complete abandonment of Dre tracks.
034580404X|5.0|Written perfectly and really non-stop page turning book! This was given as a gift. This is a book that has to be owned not borrowed.
B00C5R7B0I|3.0|&#34;Dust&#34; is better than many of Cornwell's recent novels, but that isn't saying much.  It could be a standalone. Through her main character, Boston Chief Medical Examiner Kay Scarpetta, she provides the reader with [too] frequent discussions of Lucy's past, including having a narcisstic, disinterested mother (Scarpetta's sister); Lucy's brief, conflict-laden careers with the FBI and ATF; Lucy and Scarpetta''s close but conflicted relationship; Scarpetta's belief that Lucy is a sociopath; Lucy's lesbianism, and Lucy's unique and impressive technological skills. Scarpetta's similarly complicated and long relationship with Detective Marino, now no longer her employee, is labored over ad nauseum for the first third of the novel, and then Marino essentially disappears until the book's final few pages. It is Scarpetta's relationship with her husband Benton that is the most interesting. We have known for it seems decades that their affair turned marriage, his shocking &#34;death&#34;, her grieving, and his reappearance has been fraught with passion and conflict, and all of that is present in this novel. His brilliance as a profiler is on display. But the nuances of their relationship - good and bad- are revealed bit by bit. There is a sexual current throughout the novel which is palpable, such as when Lucy is in her flight suit with many pockets or her cargo shorts; flying her helicopter or driving her custom super SUV with its throaty roar; or when Lucy discusses Gail. In addition to lesbianism, there  is a transgender issue as well. Scarpetta  comments on Marino's physical size and masculinity; she flashes back to the time she and Marino had too much wine at her house and things got out of control between them; and believes that Marino is still struggling with controlling his true feelings for her; she may harbor some less than professional feelings for him as well, but they will always remain unacted upon. The contrast between Scarpetta and Marino is expertly drawn by their treatment of their respective dogs.<br /><br />It is Scarpetta's comments about Benton, though, that are most compelling sexual devices, and Cornwell does these brilliantly and subtly, such as describing when they met while he was still married; their immediate sexual attraction;  his impeccable and masculine physical appearance; how they lightly brush up against one another while walking or are walking or standing near each other; when she touches the &#34;small muscles&#34; in his arm as he shifts the gears of his Porsche turbo; the &#34;throaty&#34; sound of the car. Scarpetta discusses their past and present sex life, her sadness when Benton &#34;disappears: and her disappointment when he remains loyal to his employer despite its shabby treatment of him and disregard for his opinions.  It can appear that what keeps Benton and Kay together is solely their common professional interests, uncompromising professional integrity, and sex.  It certainly is not their backgrounds, which are completely opposite. Yet, at the end, in a completely unconventional family holiday setting, when the main characters are together at last, Benton doesn't miss a beat and he and Kay carry on as supportive partners in every sense despite the obvious dysfunction of Kay's relatives, which we have just learned more about. Her and Lucy's compassion for others is also nicely displayed.<br /><br />I found Cornwell's use of Scarpetta &#34;telling&#34; this novel to the reader in the present tense to be very annoying. Involving Scarpetta in the aftermath of the Newton killings as a plot device was gratuitous, unnecessary and deeply offensive. Additionally, Cornwell/Scarpetta devolve into excruciating amount of unnecessary detail about things that really don't matter, which practice reaches its height in Scarpetta and Benton's search of a building, and later in a narrative about circuses, elephants and trains. Is this Cornwell showing off her knowledge of art, Italianate interior decorating, and design? Also, I get that Scarpetta is supposed to be more than the average medical examiner, and that means that she will continue to seek to find out who caused a death and why, rather than simply &#34;how&#34;, and this is what continuously gets her in trouble (although she didn't seem to be in the dog house with anyone in this book, though we were constantly reminded of her past problems in this regard) and consequently, serve as plots for Cornwell's Scarpetta novels.<br /><br />Despite these flaws and criticisms, the book was a page turner for me, and the perpetrator was a surprise. But the involvement of others remains muddled.
B00G4CXHSK|3.0|It's good, but I was fighting a boss, and it froze for a few seconds, like always, but then RIGHT when I was about to beat him, it just quit on me. And as I said before, the game sometimes freezes for a few seconds, usually resulting in death.
B00BAXFECK|2.0|&#34;The Goldfinch&#34; was my first Donna Tartt book. It will be my last. My clue should have been the fact that it took over 40 pages just to discuss the initial penultimate scene at the museum.  I started skimming it when the scene moved to Las Vegas; the book really went downhill from there. I loathed Boris, got confused and fed up with Horst and that whole scene, more blah blah blah; sentences that went on for pages.  The book badly needed an editor. if this is an editor's idea of good writing, then count me out. I am truly mystified by the accolades this book has gotten from critics. Some have written about multiple novellas within one book. It seemed pretty simple to me: a boy forever and permanently scarred emotionally by a neglectful father and the tragic death of his mother.<br />Those events cause him to make some very bad decisions. To take over 700 pages to write about it was massive overkill.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Playing this game is good for passing time but I hate the slow pace I'm forced to play by if I don't buy crowns. Only having one of most buildings/resource plots means spending a lot of time waiting compared to relatively little time actually playing. But cute, decent graphics.
0345803485|2.0|Not nearly as sexual as all the hype. I got bored and couldn't even finish the first book. Don't waste your time.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I think this game is great. As soon as you play it your hooked and you don't want to stop playing.
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|This movie is one of the funniest I have seen in a long time! There is some language, but it's all in good fun. Definite must see!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game!!! Never have a problem and always something new and fun to do on it. All the challenges are great.
B005LAII12|5.0|Hilarious!! This movie might be the funniest movie I have ever seen. It sounds stupid at first--a talking teddy bear? But they make him so lifelike that you forget he's a bear! Don't miss this one!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Ending was undesirable, not because &#34;unhappy&#34; but because many open ends left unresolved for a trilogy. Felt like author trying to make 'a point' with the unfortunate events in the end of the book, rather than making the ending in character with the rest of the series.
B00499NHLC|5.0|was one of the best version of the sherlock holmes genre i have ever seen. made me sad there are so very few of them.
B0010T0OCY|5.0|I found this on a list of under-rated sci-fi films, decided to watch it, and was amazed that I had not heard of this movie.  The plot is as mind-bending as the Matrix or Inception with some of the creepiest bad guys ever, played by Ian Richardson and Richard O'Brian.  Rufus Sewell, Jennifer Connelly and William Hurt are all outstanding. The special effects are not quite up to the very latest high-tech wizardry but it does not matter. The shadowy and dark sets really help to carry the story. Overall this is an outstanding film because of the actors and the story line.
B00C1040TO|5.0|Definitely my favorite tuner app, a must have for musicians.  Don't forget to adjust the settings before using.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Great UI<br />+ Tuner Works<br />+ Ability to Listen to a Note Before Playing It<br />+ Metronome<br />+ No Advertisements<br />+ No Invasive Permissions<br />+ Free (today)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- ?<br /><br />Definitely give this app a try if you are looking for a decent tuner.  If you are a musician, I guarantee you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Update: When I reviewed this app it was free, but $1.95 isn't bad for this app.  I still recommend it.
B00DMK6WN4|5.0|Pure love for Monsters Inc!! We heard this one was not at good as the first. That's not the case it's just a good!
B00GH4R95C|3.0|The character development of Superman was creative and interesting, but the fight scenes were too long, drawn out and boring.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|the new update is pretty cool with the underwater realm...my only complaint is the length of time it takes to build..rejuvenate..oil production etc..
B008JEJPX2|5.0|I bought these men's Crock's even though I could of bought a women's style and I am very happy with them . They are extremely comfortable , true to size , as I wear a women's 9 so I bought them a men's 8 which is a women's size 9. I wear these crocs on rough terrain and I must admit they are worth the money .......They also clean very well with just water and mild soap.....
0670024856|5.0|I liked the title and love to read.  Have not read it yet, but I know it will be great
B0000DIJO2|5.0|Out of the hundreds of concerts I've watched on dvd, this is the tops!! 31 songs in one night, awesome!!
B00CIVLZ3U|4.0|Previously I had not read any of Brandon Sanderson's books that were based in &#34;modern&#34; times. I was pleasantly surprised and found the story interesting with its twists and turns. Great plot!
1401322425|5.0|I am a really big Jamie Oliver fan so may be a little biased.this book contains the best pizza dough recipe ever.
B00G4CXHSK|5.0|Although there are a lot of games like this out there, This game has its own unique features that make it stand out of the crowd entirely. Its very easy to progress and buy new weapons, as well as unlock actual people to be.<br />Thank you, Noodlecake!
140525355X|5.0|Fun, charming stories. The right size, shape, and level for advanced first graders, all second graders, or third graders who need something cheerful to practice reading to catch up. Slightly European flavor noted in some books. My seven year old carries around his box if Mr. Men books with his treasures. Gender neutral stories. Well worth the purchase.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|Overall, Great addition to the first game, but it needs some work. Im sure it will come together beautifully given some time.
B0089EHWQE|3.0|Nice reading, but I found the ending a bit predictable.  Author used an enjoyable, conversational tone.  Good topic for book group discussion.
B005IA9JZO|5.0|I remember this movie being a great movie when I was younger and I wanted to show it to my kids. I ordered it and it looks just as good as I remember it. Definitely glad I ordered it in Blu-ray and my kids loved it!
B007AL48UK|5.0|Fun game to play.  Easy and enjoyable.  Mahjong is  relaxing .  Takes time to do but happy when I  get them all.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I'm actually learning Italian!  I love these lessons, and I love the interaction and the feedback.  What a brilliant idea!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very useful.  I like the big numbers, and is always ready to be used.  Gave up my small calculator and enjoying  this one very much.
B004LW8C0I|5.0|great for young kids to learn about strategy, thoughtfulness, and perspective.  teaches so much of life's lessons.  a must see!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love solitaire and this is one of my favorites.  Spend a lot of time on this game.  Relaxing game to play.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|great, play it all the time all day and night, grand kids play it automatic baby sitter, need more like this
B0063GORYU|5.0|Right fun with these games.  I always play a lot of games at night before I go to bed.  It seems there' not enough time at night to play these games
014241011X|5.0|I bought this book because one of my children was doing a project for class based on the book, & I could not find this book anywhere in the town I live in. The original estimated time of delivery would have been 2 days before the project was due which was workable. However it arrived much earlier than expected & the book was really good.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Couldn't put the book down for 2 whole days!! Suzanne Collins is now my favorite author for sure!! Wow just wow
B009CVRQLY|3.0|Not as good as I thought it was going to be since it is Celine. Some songs are great but overall it was a disappointment.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Best game ever! Its like you have a real horse that you are taking over! Its beautiful!!!(:<br />I love itttt!
B001H4R4LQ|4.0|I thought that this book has a lot of meaning and forces you to dig into the depths of your mind to find the lesson of the chapters, paragraphs, or even words. I recommend this book to all that love fantasy, fighting, puzzles, and action
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I hate when an author plays fast and lose like this book. Just so much info dumping and for what....to leave us with a dead feeling. When all is said and done I should have just stopped at book 2. I wouldn't have had to sit through such a bad ending and half thought out book. It is just sad.
B002ZG976U|5.0|I love this movie.  It kept coming on the Family channel and I kept recording it, but the commercials made it lame.  So I purchased this movie and I can watch it as many times as I want without commercials.  LOVE IT!!
B003G4W49C|4.0|Very entertaining and well written.  I was not familiar with the writer, and was surprised at his ability to capture my interest.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|A great sequel to an exciting reboot look at an iconic franchise and with an iconic enemy as well. Like last time the cast did a superb job playing their roles previously with some getting more screen time and some getting less though not with the main three obviously. The effects and action scenes are top notch and the shadowy story plot is an exciting twist to the Star Trek universe.<br /><br />So if you already have the first movie then don't wait and add this to your home library.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A,of letters paint in all shapes and sizes . Lemon hair, dark feathery hair but only if was clean, if it was dirty it was twigs. And the colors . I smiled at the women swearing it took me to my childhood and my little round German grandma during the same time frame. I loved The Book Thief. I hated it too..I well read it again in about a year.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|doesn't always connect with FB.., found a few levels were just slightly different from the original I was playing on PC. I still get credit for the games even if they were slightly different. A few times when I won on-line on FB, it wouldn't advance me on the kindle. I would wait a few hours and then finally poof it would magically work. Strange, but I like having the option to play in kindle so that I can catch up faster with friends.
B002AWX6UM|5.0|This is a delightful book that gives you great incite into the world of a boy soldier and his trials to get away from that life.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|its ok but it feels like I'm back on facebook and there was a reason I deleted it. but ill just keep grindin
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Lots of fun.  The game can also be very irritating.  I can't seem to stop playing until I have conquered the round.
B002KJX4IE|5.0|Beetlejuice never looked so good in HD! Great movie! I really enjoyed watching this after so many years.  I love the campy visual effects too!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|What an amazing story of extreme courage, perseverance and hope.  this book is a must read. It starts off great then slows down a bit but once you get into Operation Redwing, you will not be able to put the book down.  It is a tear-jerker and will give you a greater appreciation of those who defend our country.
B0053O89KG|5.0|We love this series and never miss a show.  We always buy the DVD when it becomes available.  I wonder what our children will think when the time comes for them to go through our strange collection of DVDs ?  lol
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is my favorite book!!!!!!!!<br />The best book i have read in awhile!!  I love the ending!! Now rereading Mocking Jay
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|It's a pretty addictive game but most stuff is too expensive and it takes forever to get crowns without having to buy them. I wish you could unlock more things without waiting to level up.  It also takes forever to level up and for some crops. And you cant buy second crops without crowns...grrr. It still is pretty fun though.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is a very fun game,especially when you can get a assault rifle!! The only down side is not being able to move forward.
0316228532|2.0|I was really disappointed in this book.  It could have done without the excessive foul language.  I hope Ms. Rowling doesn't continue in this vein.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|This app is really cool.you can edit photos by removing blemishes adding a frame and even putting cite little stickers.you should get this app. Another cool app is pic. Collage thats a great app
B00C1040TO|5.0|Well designed app to tune my string instrument. And it's free, that's awesome, totally worth it. Highly recommended for musician of any level. 2 thumbs up.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love this game people of all ages can play n have fun totally awesome:) I love pet rescue as well
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|it was very fun and a good game to pass time. its nice to just sit down after a long day and just calm down.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Kindle was lagging and apps were crashing before I ran this app. Now it's running like it was right out of the box.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|This cd is so awesome.It takes me back when i would listen to it when it barely came out.Highly recommend.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book is thoroughly deserving of 5 stars. Best book I've read in a long time. If I was compelled to to criticize something, it would be the way the story jumps around from character to character early on, and the cliffhanger chapter endings.  It was annoying and confusing, as the characters were not clearly defined yet, and it was hard to know what was going on. But that is nit-picking, and is not enough to cause me to lower my rating. I soon got acquainted with the characters, I was so completely caught up in their lives and problems that I couldn't put the book down. Liane Moriarty is a talented writer, and I look forward to reading more of her books.
B00BFV1JZI|4.0|great book it really has a proper meaning but unfortunately  it is really sad.I recommend reading the hunger games trilogy.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Star trek is one of the best science fiction out there.  I love the way the crew work together as a family.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|My husband and I both loved this book. This is the reason Stephen King is so celebrated. I liked revisiting old characters and Derry again. Some books just don't have the ending you desire.
B00EYE0ECW|4.0|Map is good but driving instructions fail to tell you what towns you are traveling through and it's important if you need a potty stop or food stop information.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|It keeps asking me to write a review so I am writing a review. The game is a fun game for the Kindle. when you zoom in on the dinosaurs they look good for these graphics.  I enjoy playing. It is like the ice age or oregon trail game.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|It is Awesome!!! It gets more and more Addicting as the show continues!! I just can't get enough of The Walking Dead!
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Fun superhero movie to watch, Hemsworth is very good.  Watch it before you see the new one, and turn up the sound.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This show has Fantastic effects!! I am always sitting in the edge of my seat waiting to see what happens!
B00DH7P6WU|4.0|What happens when your older daughter grows out of \\"Monster High\\" dolls? You are free to explore other options when you get lukewarm responses to inquiries posed to your younger kid about possible future \\"Monster High\\" dolls. I decided to go with this set because girls love getting a couple, and my daughter had only one other guy doll because \\"G.I. Joe\\" was truncated. Price here was the same as Wal-Mart's. Here's the stats:<br /><br />-Both dolls have easy to remove clothing. Velcro at back, and cords on dude's hoodie can be tied.<br />-Both dolls have shoes that are hard to remove.<br />-Most of the gal's jewelry/crown is snugly held on with bands in some areas. Will not fall off. Same with guy's cuff. His charms can be taken off of pant loop. Just watch out for the small bird ring on the gal's hand. This is easy to lose.<br />-Standard long hair on chick; dude has felt on one side, and a \\"real\\" sheath of gelled hair on the other. Do not get felt wet- my kid got another doll with felt sideburns wet, and they partially dissipated.<br />-Clock purse does not open, but guy's sack does, and can hold an extra glass slipper.<br />-Be diligent when cutting dolls' heads from packaging. The rage nowadays is trying to cut the plastic rods as close as possible to the head while pulling upwards. This is difficult if you are not a surgeon with specialized scissors, or if another adult is not nearby to help, or if you have bad eyesight. Or all three. Anyway, our dude has a visible and painful plastic nub sticking out of his head near the hairline. This will bother some people.<br />-These dolls have removable hands. Do not remove arms.<br />-Make sure you open the box fully to find the hairbrush and stands!<br />-Bookmarks are not so exciting. They do fold out to present a fable.<br /><br />So, there you have it. My older daughter noted that these are non-monster \\"Monster High\\" dolls. I do desire to purchase one of their less bland comrades. Still, it was priceless to see our neighbor's spoiled kid's wrath when my daughter opened this set. Hey, nemeses are the stuff of fairy tales after all. May we forge our own!<br /><br />Addenda: See Andrea's comment- you will learn how to deal with those pesky, leftover plastic head tag nubs. Many thanks.ighbor's spoiled kid's wrath when my daughter opened this set. Hey, nemeses are the stuff of fairy tales after all.

B0049P1VHS|5.0|This has Incredible Writing! After the first 5 minutes you are hooked! You can't wait to see what happens next!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great product. Easy to use with laptop, Phone and IPad. Makes watching stuff online very easy and the sound and picture are great.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Good clean fun! Great graphics and includes Facebook friends. Challenging missions to accomplish. I play with it on my kindle. Try it!
0810970686|5.0|I bought the book for my daughter.  The book arrived as described and she loves it.  Will definitely order again.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Good story with nice twists. Couldn't let it go. Another winner from John Grisham. Looking forward to the new novel.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I never watched the show when it was new but I'm addicted to it now.  I'm sure I'll watch the series more than once.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|It's not FREE.  You are encourage to purchase &#34;B's&#34; for a fee.  IF you don't have any &#34;B's&#34; you can't play!  UGH  :(
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  I laughed, I cried, and then I told my friends all about it.  I thought Hazel Grace was a great character.  She was sharp as a tack and had me laughing out loud at times.  However, the subject matter is pretty grim.  Hazel is a teenager who has terminal cancer and makes some friends at a support group.  You know you are in for some sadness but I enjoyed the ride.  I will look for more titles by this author.
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|Very entertaining, loved it, love the writing style, very intelligent and amusing at the same time. A little unbelievable but enjoyed it..
B00F1W1SS0|4.0|Great show, great documentary. DT is always amazing. Good price too.<br /><br />The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that the audio is not perfect. I know it's a video, but with the DTS HD Master Audio I expected better. It's not that the audio that is there isn't nice, it's that the production mix isn't great all the way through. Some songs have a fair representation of all instruments, some are low on drums, bass, or keys.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|it's awesome. I keep recommending it.<br />not what you think.  very emotional and insightful.  it makes you think what you would do...<br />loved it.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|This is such a great value for and equally great book series. I plan on getting any other books in this series as well.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book is amazing next to 50 Shades. I have fallen in love with the characters and can't wait to see what happens next!!
B00CW7KK9K|3.0|I'm not sure if I'm the target audience for this device, but I have found some uses for it.  Summary: this is a very small device that tracks how far you've walked or jogged (supposedly - didn't work for me), and how long you sleep (and supposedly sleep cycles, though I couldn't figure out how to access this info).  There is an app that you upload info from the device to, but in my experience, the app doesn't do much...<br /><br />When I received my Pulse, I wanted to try every feature to give an informed review.  I downloaded the app, and entered my information, including my current and goal weights.  I also put the device in &#34;sleep&#34; mode when I went to bed.  Sleep mode turned out to be pretty useless, because it seems to just record how long you sleep, and that's it!  I know how long I sleep, and it was uncomfortable wearing the wristband.  Plus, you have to manually turn sleep mode off and on.<br /><br />After the first day, I held the button down to upload the info to the app on my phone.  When it was done, I opened the app, and it basically just had my info in there - no suggestions or encouragement in case that matters to you.  I did notice that I can't seem to change my current weight in there - as I lose weight, I can't figure out how to adjust that.<br /><br />The Pulse has a feature for jogging that supposedly turns on when it senses you jogging, and how far you jog is viewable on a screen after the pedometer one.  I jogged/sprinted with my Pulse 3 times and this feature didn't kick in for me.  ???<br /><br />I walk a lot, up to 5 miles a day, so I've been basically been using my Pulse to keep track of that, and calories burned.  This isn't by any means necessary or helpful, just interesting I guess.<br /><br />Main benefit:<br />If you use MyFitnessPal, it's much easier to link it to your Pulse through your phone, and it automatically subtracts the number of calories you've burned with your Pulse.
0385341008|5.0|Super book about the Second World War.  It certainly caught my attention and kept me reading through the entire book.  It was about an area of the war that I knew nothing about and was most intrigued with it.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Just read it - and then read it again. And then follow the online re-reads. Seriously this book is life changing.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Great Children's movie. Easy to buy. Bought this as a gift and the kids loved it. Arrived to destination very quick.
B00DZVKQGY|5.0|Very good story kept my interest from becoming to end.Highly reccomend to family & friends. Very inspiring. & up lifting
B00F7YHDWC|1.0|It wont even install I have to keep going to the app store and hitting install its being seriously idiotic
0800141849|5.0|I love this movie no matter how many times I watch it.  I care little for what the critics thought of it then and now. Barbara Streisand is ALWAYS a joy to watch. I thought the story was extremely sweet and I would trade it any day for some of the films made now. As I tell my family...I live real life all the time...I want my entertainment to wistful, enjoyable, have a happy ending. I want to feel good and smile like a nut...and I do that with this film.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am an everyday average person.  I love to read and really appreciate thoughtful, well planned storytelling with an intelligence factor required.  This started off slowly.  I persevered.  It rewarded me in so many ways.  What an exclusive, amazing story.  And the writer is going to be such a big name!!!  I won't even attempt to describe the story-where's the fun in that?  Read it for yourself.  Push past the beginning.  It's a little confusing and slow, but as things begin to happen, you won't be able to turn pages fast enough.
1452126577|5.0|The book is funny from a people standpoint and the cat is a hoot. He writes ways to be grumpy in all facets of life . I guess the expression on the cat's face is caused by a birth defect ,but it is amazing and the photos chosen by the author match the text in many many ways. It is a quick read that will make you wish there was more.(especially if you are a cat person&#62;)A great way to spend an hour or so.
B00EL6ACOI|5.0|First, a disclaimer: I know Samantha Berg and her husband - they were my late father's acupuncturists. I knew Sam for several months before I knew that she was involved in this film, or that she had been a SeaWorld trainer. I consider them both people of the highest integrity.<br /><br />I had already read a great deal of the background of the film before seeing it, but I was just not prepared for the impact of the film itself. I'm no wilting flower - I served a tour in Iraq as a medical NCO - but some of the scenes were very hard to watch. Seeing the mother orcas after their calves were taken from them was terrible. Having seen orcas in the wild, I had already been anti-SeaWorld for many years, but I had no idea how bad their treatment of the orcas was.<br /><br />If you have any doubts about whether orcas should be kept captive for human entertainment and profit, your questions will be answered. This film goes right to the source of first-hand information (the former trainers, who all say in the film that at the time they started, they thought they were doing a good thing - and who all say that they now strongly oppose SeaWorld).<br /><br />I can't say you will enjoy this film - but I recommend it highly.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Considering the year that this story was conceived and written it is a tale of vision and relevance as we read it 30 years later. A lot to think about.
B000A6T1JU|4.0|Classic move.  Great for me, because I had seen it before when I was younger.  With the action of movies nowadays I'm not sure it would be liked as much by someone seeing it for the first time.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|PERFECT!!! ORDERED IT FOR THE HUBBY AND ITS GREAT THANK U AGAIN!! WILL DEF BUY AGAIN ROM THESE PEPS :)
B00FXEL00W|5.0|This is one of those universal stories and yet feels so unique. I finished it all in one sitting because I was so enthralled by the story I wanted to see what happened and yet I didn't want it to end. Such a great story told in a clever way. Definitely recommended!!
B00DYFCYSO|5.0|John Legend never disappoints, i mean never. It's sad that he's underappreciated. There isn't one bad song on the entire album. Definitely one his best along with Evolver, Once Again & Get Lifted
B004DLPXAO|4.0|This is not a &#34;how to&#34; book. Rather, it is an interesting read for someone with an interest in what goes into the making of portraits of prominent or very time-poor individuals. The notes on the techniques also shed light on the thoughts in the mind of the photographer prior to the actual shoot. In many ways, the techniques and approach should be considered for any type of relatively staged portrait shoot!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The game the room is a great game for you if you enjoy ominous puzzles. I am willing to buy the second one hoping it was just as good. P.S. The storyline is Magnificent!
B004H1V5RU|5.0|My boys love all levels of the perplexus and spend a lot of time trying to conquer it. Everyone who comes in the house wants to pick it up and try it, regardless of their age. Great purchase.
B000HF4TIM|5.0|A classic to watch again and again. hilarious and witty. great one liners and lots of action! T must see this every time its on.
B00EHMG358|5.0|Great writing, great story line. I am just sorry that I didn't notice that this was just a teaser and not the whole book.
B0073PZIYI|5.0|Weird but in a good way! I really enjoyed the story line and it shows us that anything can be turned into valuable. it just depends on the situation we live in.
0425252868|5.0|Incredible book and story....you cannot go wrong with this book. It is truly inspirational and really makes you think about how you treat others in horrible circumstances
B003SI84D6|5.0|I prefer this movie over all the other Wyatt Earp movies. I think Kurt Russell really captures the intimidation airs that the real Wyatt must of possessed!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Fascinating and informative look in the historical life of Jesus.  Based on facts and general knowledge of the time.  Not the biblical history rendition of Jesus.
B006C45MRE|3.0|I enjoyed this movie but it is not quite what I would deem a watch again and again. it was good but not really up my ally.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|it helps pass time really fun,  its nice to have a game be free and loads of fun.  nines e'en twenty
B007P3S1AQ|5.0|This a a very interesting movie that takes a tragic experience into a whole new direction. sad and funny and dramatic, like the roller coaster of emotions we all face.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great way to make any TV a &#34;Smart TV&#34;. I use it mainly for Netflix. Can't beat the price. I would recommend to a friend.
0684824906|5.0|An elegant book, beautifully written. The numerous previous reviews cover it all, but I just finished it and loved it so much that I felt compelled to come add to the 5-star reviews.  Goodwin makes you feel as if you really know these people.
B000HKYOK0|4.0|My 19 year old watched this one. She is just getting into the original Star Trek as both mom & dad loved it.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This game I got this week. My friend has been raving about and I gotta say it's pretty addictive. So I suggest it definitely if you get bored because involves a lot of time or no time at all depends on how you look at it.
B00DAPOHU6|5.0|Another excellent work by the man who epitomizes laid back happy guitar strumming tunes. A few love ballads sprinkled in with the cheerful numbers. Listened to it on a loop for three weeks solid when received and never got tired of it!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Did not know what to expect, but game play<br /> is challenging and a lot of fun! Expect levels to get progressively harder.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this app.game is very good. My daughter started playing it too. very additive game. It get harder as you keep passing level.
0385523394|4.0|Good book!  Interesting to hear what it is like to live in jail; and to read about the dynamics/relationships that are created among other prisoners and workers.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|Repetative, but fun all the way through. It's worth playing for a little while. Also, the artwork almost rivals Magic the Gathering
1250038820|5.0|This is such an inspiring book. It made me laugh and cry. I even ordered several other copies for friends.  Just love it.
B002FQOI0A|4.0|I liked the book a lot. Very unexpected ending, there should be a sequel. The only thing I didn't like is it never says if they get married.
B006BFK5DK|5.0|I am an avid Earth Wind & Fire fan.  I love this CD and will love their music forever.  I'm playing this CD to death right now.  You can never fail with the &#34;Elements&#34;.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Because I love this series!! I missed a couple shows and I'm so happy that I can get then from Amazon,
B00C0ALZ0W|4.0|Its a good book, but if you have been working remotely already then you will not read anything new in it. Its more about getting a company to switch to remote work then it is about actually working remotely.
1449325947|5.0|Well written and concise. The book came in new condition as advertised and shipped promptly. The book contains examples I haven't seen before.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh Howey is a gift to us all.  This is a hopeful post-apocryphal joy to read.  If you get through Wool 1 you will be hooked.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I love this game their is always so much to do. Hate the wait times but you can use that time to fill up your inventory
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|OK, I was a Hobbit and Lord of the Rings fan when they were just books that I read and reread. Had to see and own all the movies and none of them have disappointed. If you're a fan of the LOTR movies, you'll enjoy it. If you are a reader who know the books, you'll still enjoy it. Looking forward to part 2
B00B8R1NP0|2.0|This would have been a terrific read if only the editing had been better. The story was really interesting, but apparently the editor never heard of simple contractions. \\"I am,\\" \\"he or she is or will,\\" and other examples of terms that are just about always spoken as \\"I'm\\" or I'll\\" or \\"she's\\" were never shown appropriately, making dialogue stilted, to say the least. The problem affected the narrative as well, turning what could have been a four- or five- star novel into - for this reader, at least - only a two-star read. A few additional minor grammatical issues could be overlooked, but not that one big one.<br />Still, I look forward to further adventures of Max and Jesse. I just hope Mr. Theide gets a new editor. A good editor could make all the difference, not just for grammar, but in how the story is developed. Give Max and Jesse some LIFE, for pete's sake! They could be really interesting characters, and build a real following - with the right editor!
B004SOR4H6|4.0|If you want to use Twitter on your Kindle, this works. I'm not a regular user as a reader or poster, but do like the availability.
B00ER23UYA|5.0|I fell in love with her first album. Her second release (EP) was alright. But this album really shines. You can't put Diane into a single category today. You might even say that you can hear a hint of Stevie Nicks hiding in there on a few tracks!<br /><br />From the title track to the end, you'll find this album worth every dollar you'll spend on it and more. If you get a chance to see her perform, do it. I was fortunate enough to catch her at SUBTERRANEAN while on a business trip to Chicago in October. She sounded every bit as good as the album with a slightly heavier beat on some tracks. Her lyrics are catchy and meaning full all at the same time.<br /><br />A few of my favorite tracks are: Superstars, Love and War, Pretty in Pain (love the part of about &#34;some bridges were meant to be burned...&#34;), Adelaide, Diamonds in the Dust, All The Love You Got and Lighthouse.<br /><br />If you need something new to listen to and don't want to regret the purchase, get this album now!<br /><br />The deluxe version of this album is well worth the extra couple of bucks you'll spend.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I'm a Facebook addict and this app makes it easier to read than on my phone and easier to access than on my computer.
B005EGXTHG|4.0|With the second movie in the trilogy out, I decided I better read the book before watching the film as I am the type of girl who would prefer to read the book first, then watch the movie . I had a fair idea what the second book was about , but it wasn't till I started reading it that I discovered I was in for a ride as Book #2 is when we witness the aftermath of what has happened since Peeta and Katniss both won the 74th Hunger Games. In Book #2 we read as due to the winning of not one but two people and from District 12 nonetheless , it has caused quite a stir and a revolution is building. Also this year is the Quarter Quell in which they bring back the tributes who are still alive every 25 years to compete in another form of The Hunger Games. It is normally just one boy and one girl from each district but can be from any winning year.  In District 12, they have had two male winners - Haymitch and Peeta but only one female = Katniss which means she is back in the arena.  Catching Fire compared to Book #1 tugs more on your emotions as we see the repurcussions played out more for breaking the rules from deaths to whippings to being made into a slave.<br />Will Katniss and Peeta survive another round of the Hunger Games or will this be goodbye to one or the other ?<br />Find out in Book #2 Catching Fire and read before you head to the movies to check out the flick.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is a very addictive game that you do not need any friends to play, unlike the FB based games. Good brain exercise in patter matching.
B00FHB7398|3.0|I play on Kindle Fire 1st generation. The lag time between ALL scenes is very distracting from the game.  There is even lag times where the title of the game appears while the player waits for the next scene,  or the journal.  Also,  the many hidden object games takes away from the flow of the game.<br />I have said it before,  and I guess I will always feel this way:  TRUE point and click adventure games do not have HOGs. That was,  and should still be,  a whole separate genre.<br />The player goes along,  figuring out where to go next,  or what to do,  and,  BAM! Interruption with a HOG.<br />That being said,  I liked the mini-games. ( I did not like the realistic-looking bugs. Wished a reviewer had mentioned that previously!)<br />The length of the game is due to the lag time and the HOGs.<br />I don't want to be bombarded with name -calling or insults again,  but I did not care for this game. I wish there had been a free part offered,  so I would not have purchased the unlock. This is just my opinion,  and I don't want to have to battle,  verbally,  my right to have it.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|Loved this movie. I've dealt with bipolar people in my life and it was interesting to see it portrayed on screen. Enjoyed the movie. For someone who has never dealt with mental illness, it can be an eye opener.
B00GHJ6BJW|2.0|So disappointed! I've loved all Lady Gaga's previous albums, but this one is just a lot of filler. It really seems lazy and slapdash. I quite like Applause and Gypsy, but beyond that I didn't like any other songs on the album.
1452113432|5.0|I love this cookbook.  it is beautiful.  it now contains my go-to recipes for all of the classics like quiche, clafoutis, etc!  Some classic classics and many lovely modern twists on classics too.  I own a TON of cookbooks and this one is one of the best!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Its really useful and easy to use. No surpises in app.<br />Works good with kindle. After using this my tablet performs better than before.
B0086WQNZ0|5.0|I cannot say enough about this set.  I am a real fan.  After hearing these recordings, it's hard to listen to any other keyboard interpretations.
0393317552|5.0|this should be mandatory reading for everyone on the planet; the foundation by which we all agree on our shared roots.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|it was very good a a life telling story and it really touched on a lot of things I was going through
B0050DIWFC|5.0|i was shocked! for once the ending wasn't what i expected..i never saw it coming. a mother's love and more
1250038820|5.0|EXCELLENT BUY!<br />Fantastic book.  Love to &#34;people watch&#34;, and this is a very fun way to get to know the people and the city.
B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|Every time I doubt her, Gaga comes out the box swinging like a champ. This album is pure fun and most of the songs are perfect for your 20-minutes on the elliptical -- or if you want to dance like no one's looking while cleaning up your place. I'm glad I got it.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|This game is pretty simple but pretty good. Helps kill a lot of time. But really a strategy game but it is still fun
B009NPA3Q4|4.0|Amazing for just being out of American Idol.  “Home” is getting a lot of plays on alternative and soft rock stations.  A very good first attempt.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|Its a Blu Ray first of All so quality of the product is perfect.  Shipped in a few days of when it went on sale and I enjoyed the movie.  Personally I was hesitant about Brad Pitt in a Zombie Movie but he did good.
B0000669JL|5.0|The best compilation of Bob Marley.  Some of the cuts are the best I have ever heard from Marley.  If you like Marley, you will love this.
B00ET0PZDO|4.0|Not too bad. its a brain teasing way to kill time. ive played others that were a little more interesting.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|Hilarious!  You need to be a treky and to be into UFO type things to appreciate the movie.  Yes, there are profanity and agnostic views. I think in moderation, the references are funny and a little thought provoking.  If those things are offensive to you, don’t buy this movie.
B008CPZNL6|3.0|I debated whether to rate this Kindle Fire version a 2-star (I don't like it) or a 3-star (It's okay).  Would have chosen a 2.5 if it was available.<br /><br />The Kindle Fire version (1.9.26) is lagging in both performance and features from their iOS and Android siblings (which, as of mid-November 2013, is at 2.1.1).  I had to look it up to see when the Android 1.9.x version was released-- it looks like around Fall of... 2012!  The version here on Amazon has a code base that's a year old?<br /><br />1st Gen Kindle Fire:<br />It was slow and frequently crashed. For me, if I had a Magazine created in the 2.0 versions of the iOS/Android platform, that would prevent the KF version from completely loading all of the articles/headlines.  If I logged out and logged back in, the KF version would sit there, spinning away and not log in.  I had to log into another Flipboard account that didn't have Magazines.  I sent a support query to the folks at Flipboard and essentially received a &#34;Thanks for letting us know&#34; reply.<br /><br />Kindle Fire HD (7&#34;- 2012):<br />This same KF version didn't crash as often on the HD and it was able to completely log in and retrieve my subscribed articles/headlines from the same Flipboard account where I had Magazines created.  Still a little laggy compared to the Android version running on a 1st gen Nexus 7.  However, the view the application gave me was the phone-optimized view, not the table-optimized view.<br /><br />Kindle Fire HDX (7&#34; - 2013):<br />I could copy and paste the text above for the HD here.  Except I get the tablet-optimized view on the HDX.<br /><br />Common to the above devices, my RSS feeds was not being refreshed.  I'll go view my feeds on an iOS device on a Nexus 7 and it'll be current.  Switch back to one of the above KFs?  The last updated feed would be a day or more ago.  A little problematic when I'm viewing RSS feeds from Slickdeals/Techbargins.  An uninstall/reinstall or clear settings would pull down updated feed content but that's not a good workaround.<br /><br />Starting with my usage on the original KF, I've experimented with sideloading the latest 2.1.1 (as of mid Nov 2013) Android version.  On the 1st gen KF, I was able to use the current feature set (like Magazines) and get my refreshed RSS feeds but got the phone-optimized view.  Performance was very slow.  Would occasionally cause the &#34;not responding&#34; error.<br /><br />The 2012 HD fared much better-- I haven't experienced a crash or wait (yet) and the performance is very acceptable.  I also get the tablet-optimized view and access to Magazines and refreshed RSS feeds.<br /><br />But with the 2013 HDX, I was getting a crash a day over the last couple of weeks I've had the HDX-- but that was before the Fire OS 3.1 upgrade.  I'll come back in a couple week's time after running it with Fire 3.1.  Otherwise, performance and usability was good when it wasn't crashing.<br /><br />A side note: A few months ago, I took another 1st gen KF and converted it to an Android 4.2 via N2AOS.  The Android flavor of Flipboard ran a little sluggish on it but it didn't crash on me.  Magazines and RSS feeds usable.<br /><br />A query to Flipboard support folks resulted in a &#34;We are working with Amazon to have our latest releases updated to the Kindle app store. We hope to have them available as soon as possible.&#34;<br /><br />Thanks for reading this far.  I ended up giving the Kindle Fire version 3-stars for this reason:  If you can live without Magazines and your RSS feeds, and depending on what device you're using it on, it may be just good enough if you have Flipboard's curated selections as your flips.<br /><br />if you use Magazines and/or RSS and are not tolerant to crashes, you might have to get another solution.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this whole book. It kept me interested. Just an all around awesome story. Will definitely read more Nicholas Sparks books.
B00ECU2RGY|1.0|it's a waste of time. The makers of this movie obviously think that if it has Tom Cruise in it, it should be fine even without a decent script.  Well, it ain't.  It's down there with Vanilla Sky and some of the other story-less, disjointed futuristic flicks Cruise has to his credit.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|Love the story! Love Diane Lane.Great family movie with some history to it.The best since Seabiscuit.<br /> I love the cast in this movie.
B000WOT41K|5.0|Great compilation! All the stuff you know, and perhaps a few you don't. Using the cloud player makes it all the more better. Stream it!

B0087ZG7NO|5.0|Love the participants, love the locale, love the story. May there be more sequels, hopefully as well-done as this was.

B00BPDR3F6|5.0|I enjoyed this novel immensely. Every step in her life was compelling and there were no ordinary experiences.  The only disappointment was that her desire for physical love was not fulfilled.
B00GINENG0|5.0|I love this game! You see how your kitten grows up. I think almost any age would enjoy this game! I'd give it a 100 star rating if I could!

B007N8RULO|5.0|great game. Fun to play and works well with the android platform. I recommend this game  to those who like solitare.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|It's a little slow but pretty fun, moving on to new levels is slow, easy to get the hang of and cool characters

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love this book!!! At first I thought it was something I would not be interested in but after a few chapters I could not put it down.  Can't wait to read all the others. I love buying books for my kendel.
B00FEMJF6O|1.0|Upon hearing that this game is now available for Kindle Fire I was excited only to be disappointed that it's not compatible to my device. Doesn't make sense to tell us it is when it isn't. I don't understand how I was able to get it but can't download it. That doesn't make sense either.<br /><br />Others have commented that it is compatible to certain versions of the Kindle Fire, if that's the case that should have been mentioned.<br /><br />But, I have to admit that I was still able to get the coins so for that I am happy.<br /><br />Please fix this problem for your customers who still love their Kindle Fire.
B009POCG5Y|5.0|Heartwarming baseball story.  Great frying pan scene & happy ending. Thank God for chemistry.  Pair it with Money Ball & get out the popcorn
0788859544|5.0|Bought this movie for my 2 year old niece. She loves it! (spoiler alert!) I think its hilarious when she starts to cry because she thinks the witch is gonna marry the prince. Good to know kids these days still enjoy the movies that I grew up with when I was a kid. Were slowly trying to build up a collection of Disney movies for her.
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|Definitely one of my new favorite books!!!  I love the characters and their personalities - Pia and her attitude are delightful
B0011N1WE8|2.0|The movie is excellent and adorable. I would recommend it for anyone with a heart. One of my all time favorite movies.<br /><br />But the thing skips. It wasn't like new. Not satisfied with the quality.
1449410243|5.0|Hilarious!  I laughed so much I had tears in my eyes.  Warning though some parts are a little R rated which I didn't realize when I bought it.  The Bobs remind us of our cats!
B00FHATBGW|2.0|It doesn't give any help if you get stuck on one of the puzzles. Don't get the full version it ain't worth it.
B00C1040TO|5.0|Very impressed with how many features this app offers while maintaining a very attractive and usable interface. Plus, it does it's job really well. I've stopped using my dedicated analogue tuner because this one is more functional! Of course, it also helps that it's always in my pocket.
B00GOQ9M4O|3.0|As awesome as the previous episode was, this one was equally as bad. The writing and acting of the second sister was pointless and forced-- I think she helped ruined an already weak script. Whoever wrote the episode before this one needs to just take over and everyone should just step away and let them do their thing. They could have made Bryan's return to humanity something special. Instead...well, crap, I'm just pissed. They really raised the bar in the previous episode and dropped it hard as hell here.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|I have loved western movies my whole life, beginning when I was a young boy and saw cowboy movies like Rocky Lane, Roy Rogers, Gene Autry and the Lone Ranger.  I did not see this film when it first came on television because my experience with viewing made for T.V. westerns were many times disappointing; however, I had heard from so many other western fans how good Lonesome Dove was and I purchased this 2-Disc Collector's Edition at a bargain price.  Needless to say, I was very impressed with this western story, which is the best one I have ever seen on television.<br /><br />At a longtime fan of Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones, I think they were perfect for the roles of two former Texas Rangers who were lifetime friends.  This is the kind of western that will always be a classic.  Besides having an absolutely fantastic cast, the writers have weaved a story that is compelling and interesting.  This is a movie that has all the elements that make a movie great.  They include, writers who understand westerns, believable actors for the parts, great characters you can relate to and understand their motives, great dialogue, drama, action and even romance.  This is the kind of western that one could watch over and over again.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you are a real fan of westerns this is one DVD set that should be in your personal collection.  I am glad to have mine.<br /><br />Rating:  5 Stars.  Joseph J. Truncale  (Author: The Samurai Heart: An old warrior's poetic tribute.

B005GSZZ1A|4.0|I will always remember this story of Shin's life in Camp 14, his harrowing escape, and courageous adjustment to life outside the camp. &#34;I am evolving from being an animal,&#34; he says. &#34;But it is going very, very slowly. Sometimes I try to cry and laugh like other people, just to see if it feels like anything.&#34;<br /><br />The notes and photographs at the end of the book are worth studying and add to the reader's understanding. Writer Blaine Harden tells Shin's story by hearing it through an interpreter over a period of two years on two continents. It feels pieced together because it took time for Shin to spill the truth of his life and escape, and the writer stays true to Shin's story as told without embellishment.<br /><br />I knew North Korea was a tough place to live. Now I know the world can't just stand by and let generations of thousands of humans live and die in these prison camps.
B008Y6SLL2|4.0|It was a great movie but the ending left me hanging.  There was no closure as far as I am concerned.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book all of my friends told me I need to read it and it is a very talked about book. I liked the story and it was great to see how he gets what he wants. The bondage was light. Spanking to me was light. But, some people are offended by it so why did you read it? Curiosity I guess. I did not like the some odd 522 pages. There were a lot of &#34;Fill in words&#34; that could have been left out to make the book shorter. Long books are not for me so I guess I am not a &#34;True Novelist&#34; reader. I will not be buying the 2nd book because of the length. Now there are books out of 50 shades of everything! Some of those are entertaining and shorter. If you are curious about this stuff, it to me is light and not offensive. It has a great story that almost tempted me to go onto the next one but I can do without it.

B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The Husband's Secret was worth the read, the premise was interesting and kept my attention through until the end. However the husband John Paul didn't seem like a realistic character.

B005HEI7EU|4.0|Pure fantasy but great fun. William Smithers as Merrick plays a solid role. When watching this episode on Amazon Prime on a laptop computer, I don't know why the new SFX scenes expand into letterbox widescreen, then shrink to T.V. standard trim size when it returns to the original scenes. No matter, I find it annoying. Perhaps it's an artifact of the laptop?
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|I purchased this book via download on a whim because it kept popping up on my recommendation list. It's short and to the point and Pam really shows you the beauty of our true world with the experiments. I see things in a different light now.

B007BFSYMS|4.0|I really enjoy this app. It works like a charm every time I use it. The selection of sounds are fantastic--many of the, I would never have thought of as relaxing. It is a fun ritual for me to pick my play list every night before bed. My only complaint is that you can't mix sounds together. I would love to blend the gentle creaking of the boat with the more consistent sound of waves.
B00E4W40C4|5.0|The Unrated Cut runs about 12 minutes longer than the Theatrical Cut, and contains several new scenes including a much expanded ninja action scene.  Wolverine drops a few more choice curse words and there is now CG-gore.  I'd say it's more like a hard PG-13 rather than an R-rated cut.<br /><br />The UNRATED Cut is much better than the theatrical cut.<br /><br />**Note, SPOILERS follow, so read at your own risk**.<br /><br />1) There is more gore, but primarily CGI blood sprays.  Some shots of Wolverine's claws going through people's limbs, but nothing explicit.  No graphic dismemberments.<br /><br />2) Wolverine drops a few more f-bombs.<br /><br />3) Some of the opening scenes depicting Wolverine at the POW camp are a little longer.<br /><br />4) The scene involving Wolverine, an arrow, and the hunter is slightly longer and more brutal.<br /><br />5) Slightly longer dialogue with Yukio on the way to the plane.<br /><br />6) Relationship between Mariko and Yashida and Shingen and  Yashida is better fleshed out in the unrated cut.<br /><br />7) A new scene where Yashida asks Logan his age.<br /><br />8) A new scene with Yashida talking to Shingen on his deathbed, telling him, \\"You are not the man to lead Yashida\\".<br /><br />9) A new scene at the love hotel where the Yakuza show up and get into a fight with Wolverine.  Mariko intervenes and demonstrates some fighting skill as well.<br /><br />10) Wolverine's operation on himself is bloodier.<br /><br />11) The fight scene between Shingen and Wolverine is slightly longer and now depicts Shingen rather graphically cutting into Wolverine's shoulder blade (no blood though).<br /><br />12) A new scene where Viper gives Hadana poison for his arrows, which he later uses to bring down Wolverine at the ninja fight.<br /><br />13) The ninja fight scene is now much longer.  Wolverine gets dragged away in nets and hit by ninjas on bikes.  Yukio shows up to assist Wolverine and drives around in a snow plow chopping up hapless ninjas (some hearty blood spraying).  Wolverine lights his familiar cigar midway through the battle.<br /><br />I'm actually glad the extra action scenes were removed from the theatrical cut.  Some of the action seemed a bit silly (e.g. ninjas hitting Wolverine with their motorbikes, although Wolverine lighting his trademark cigar was nifty).  Furthermore, Yukio's appearance detracted from Wolverine's thematic solo search for Mariko.  Didn't think Yukio added much to the scene.<br /><br />14) The Silver Samurai battle is the same length as previously.<br /><br />Overall, the unrated cut is much better dimensioned than the theatrical cut.  This is the one to get!!jas (some hearty blood spraying).

B005LAIIGM|4.0|****1/2<br /><br />\\"Gravity\\" is that rare movie that, while a tour-de-force on a technical level, also happens to come with a great deal of its own - pardon the pun - gravitas.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock, in a bravura, near-one-woman performance, plays Dr. Ryan Stone, an astronaut on her first mission into outer space, sent there on Space Shuttle Explorer to perform some much-needed repairs on the Hubble Space Telescope. While she's space walking with veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), the shuttle is hit by debris from a missile strike the Russians have launched to take out a non-operational satellite. Things go from bad to worse when the two astronauts are torn away from the now-destroyed shuttle and are cast out into deep space with little hope for a safe return to earth.<br /><br />Director Alfonso Cuaron has gathered together a team of technological wizards to replicate, as closely as is humanly possible, the experience of floating adrift in outer space: the weightlessness, the uncontrollable spinning (warning: take your Dramamine beforehand), the immense size and grandeur of Earth as seen from hundreds of miles above the surface.  The purely visceral nature of the movie goes a long way towards mitigating any qualms one might have as to the plausibility of every single thing it is showing us.<br /><br />The screenplay by Cuaron and his son Jonas does well within the admittedly restrictive parameters demanded by the narrative, which is why the performances of Bullock and Clooney ultimately play so crucial a role in the success of the movie. They make us care about the people to whom this is happening - and, without that, all the special effects in the world couldn't make this concept work. Even from inside a space helmet, Bullock runs the gamut of emotions from queasiness to fear to anger to despair to resignation to hope to determination. It's all there, packed within a taut hour-and-a-half-long running time.<br /><br />In a way, a film like \\"Gravity\\" makes movie-reviewing almost superfluous, since it's virtually impossible to convey in words the true nature of the experience. Go watch it for yourself.ty\\" makes movie-reviewing almost superfluous, since it's virtually impossible to convey in words the true nature of the experience. Go watch it for yourself.

Very entertaining movie Jamie Foxx played a wonderful role as president under duress, never forgetting his place as president of this great nation but real and human at the same time.  Channing Tatum was good as the young and fearless agent.  Shows promise but still has some maturing as an actor.  Perhaps got thrown too early into the lead role of a high action/drama.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|I read constantly, and many books I read vanish into the mind's cracks within months of reading them. Not this one. Without a doubt, Life of Pi is one of the best, most memorable books I've read in my lifetime. I purchased the audiobook version, and it sat in my device for months, because I was expecting talking animals like in Narnia and was convinced I wouldn't like it.<br /><br /> I  WAS  WRONG!<br /><br />This book has NO talking animals, and I loved it so much that I want to go back and read it a second time (I can't believe I just said that; I *never* say that). I've already gone back to read certain chapters after having read the end.<br /><br />Brilliantly written, dazzlingly executed. the detailed concept of this book came to the author within a shocking 20-30 minute time period. If you do get the chance, *after* reading the book do look up the Wikipedia page called &#34;Richard Parker (shipwrecked).&#34; The name of the huge ship the family rides on in the book (&#34;Tsimtsum&#34;) is also a significant title...be sure to look it up.<br /><br />I'm not the religious type, so when I heard this book had a spiritual approach, I further worried it would delve too much into the religious. But instead, I found a broader perspective of spirituality and the book had much to teach this reader. The layers of meaning apparent to the reader only after completing the book become something that will leave the reader digesting it for days after completing it, perhaps longer.<br /><br />The prose of the book is delicious, simply magical. The author is a brilliant, gifted writer. The audiobook version is narrated by a man with an authentic Indian accent, and what a superb job he did, adding different voices and humor throughout. He gave Pi a warm, lovable personality with wit.<br /><br />The surprise ending is one that really makes the reader take a deep gasp....and is what made me want to go back and experience the book again, reading it through a different perspective the next time.<br /><br />With most books I read, I'm hungry to reach the ending to either learn the mystery's answer or to nab the surprise ending or twist. This book....I never wanted it to end. I wanted it to go on forever. My commutes were hours of pure magic.<br /><br />Read it. Stop reading the reviews and just get the book already. If there were a special category for lifetime-best books that exceeded 5 stars, this book would get one. This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

1250038820|5.0|Brandon  Stanton’s  “Humans  of New York”  (2013) captures  the joy, diversity, and promise of American and New York City life  in a book of 400 glossy color photographs.  Taken over a three-year period, the photographs  show people of all ages, races, economic classes ,religions, and conditions of life. There are photographs of people alone, with their pets, with lovers, or with friends and family.  Some of the subjects are homeless street people while others clearly live a life of opulence. People are shown at work and play, dreaming, talking fighting, extroverted and meditative. The photographs in the volume are all taken with the knowledge of the subjects and thus, to a greater or lesser degree, posed rather than candid.<br /><br />The variety of New York City, with its busy downtown streets, residential areas, apartments, bridges, buildings, parks, and some surprisingly quiet places serve as the background.  The focus of the book is on people – on their faces, clothes, hands, and jewelry.  The city locations, however, constitute an integral part of each photo. A short caption accompanies most of the photographs.  In many cases, the photos are accompanied by a short anecdote or story about the subject.<br />Many readers came to this book through an extensive blog of an even larger collection of photos that the author took and maintains.  I did not know of the blog until I found the book.  I was glad of the opportunity to enjoy and respond to the book fresh in seeing it for the first time rather than to come to it with expectations of its content from viewing the blog. I found effective the arrangement of the photos, the use of captions, and the relatively spare use of stories to accompany the pictures.  The photographs speak for themselves.<br /><br />Brandon Stanton the author, developed his talent for photography in an unusual and pressured way. He had been working in the financial markets of Chicago as a bond salesman and received a camera a gift.  The gift allowed Stanton  to begin taking pictures of buildings and places in Chicago as a hobby and then to branch gradually into photographing people..  When he lost his job, Stanton decided to make a career change. He began to move from city to city, including Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, taking photos with his interest moving  to photographing people.  Stanton became fascinated with New York City and its opportunities, moved to the City, and began to photograph in earnest.  He soon received widespread recognition on media which translated into this book.  Thus, Stanton’s photos of a city and its people reinventing themselves parallel s his own reinvention of himself and his path in life.<br /><br />Many artists, poets, novelists, and photographers have been fascinated by the speed and diversity of America’s greatest city.  With all its predecessors, Stanton’s book is poignant and alive.  The book speaks of optimism, diversity, and hope for the city and its people.<br /><br />Of the many allusions this book could suggest, the one that came to mind was “New York Tendaberry” a 1969 album by singer, composer, and pianist Laura Nyro  (1947--  1997). Nyro’s album with its eleven songs is essentially an ode to New York City. In particular, in the title track, Nyro writes of New  York:<br /><br />“Sidewalk  and pigeon<br />You look like a city,<br />But you feel like a religion to me.”<br /><br />Nyro's song concludes in a paean to the city:<br /><br />“Where quakers and revolutionaries<br />Join for life, for precious years<br />Join for life through silver tears<br /><br />New  York tendaberry.”<br /><br />Stanton’s photos have the intimate feel  of Laura Nyro’s song.  The book and the song convey messages of hope about the ideals of American urban life and of the American experience.<br /><br />Robin Friedmane gift allowed Stanton  to begin taking pictures of buildings and places in Chicago as a hobby and then to branch gradually into photographing people..  When he lost his job, Stanton decided to make a career change. He began to move from city to city, including Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, taking photos with his interest moving  to photographing people.  Stanton became fascinated with New York City and its opportunities, moved to the City, and began to photograph in earnest.  He soon received widespread recognition on media which translated into this book.

B0034DGP6S|5.0|A must read non-fiction book for any woman considering getting married, those already married, those in a relationship and those who aren't in a relationship (have I covered everyone?).<br /><br />It looks at the history of marriage and is a real eye opener about what day to day marriage actually means and involves - and in doing so, provides some excellent food for thought about relationships in general - including what we give up when we get married or enter a relationship.  It touches on tough subjects including finance and whether or not you want children, what is truly in it for women in our modern world and whether marriage is relevant anymore.<br /><br />A well written, soul searching, rip it out and put it on the table personal  account by Elizabeth Gilbert.<br /><br />A great book for any daughters, nieces or those women you care about.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am regretting downloading this game. It has consumed most of my free time since I installed it. I will randomly see candy in my mind during work meetings or at dinner. I think I need an intervention.
B00BXI0IHS|5.0|I have to say I foolishly didn't read Gilbert's earlier novel  'Eat Pray and Love' because the film of the same name looked so very cheesy.  However, The subjects covered in 'The Signature of All Things' meant I put my presumptions aside and gave the author a (well deserved) chance.  This is a terrific book  - quite often I would be very happily coasting along, enjoying the book and there, all of sudden, would be an extraordinarily well written paragraph.  Actually, this happened several times.<br /><br />Set at the beginning of the 1800s we follow the life of Alma - a child with an extraordinarily curious mind.  Born in Philadelphia into a privileged, wealthy family her father is a renowned botanist, who served under Sir Joseph Banks and Captain Cook while her mother is a strict woman from an influential Dutch family - both are major influences on her life.<br /><br />As we follow Alma's development into adulthood and her own career we are introduced to some remarkable characters, taken around the world and involved in a love story which while beautiful is also heart-breaking.  This story provides some wonderful insights into the extraordinary world we live in and the extraordinary world within us.  Happy endings?  I won't ruin it for you but lets just say a life well lived doesn't always involve perfect endings.  Terrific.
B00FPH51LQ|4.0|This was a surprisingly good buddy cop flick.  I didn't have high hopes, but was pretty pleased overall with typical Jeff Bridges style.
B001F7MSFW|4.0|i bought this years ago and i forgot to rate it. infact, i have a lot to rate this days.  the second movie is actually good. i was expecting it to follow the path of failed superman releases. but, to my surprise, it was actually entertaining. i can't go into the storyline, because you can read the other reviews, which pretty much gives you  the summary of the movie. the biggest question is this: will ron pearlman do another hell boy movie instead doing voice over for the animation? your guess is as good as mine. he's an older actor who can still act in his age. all i want to know is if he can keep it up with another hellboy. cause, it pretty much fits its image.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|When this game first came out I didn't get all the hype about it.  I tried it and wasn't really impressed.  I had it on my phone and started playing just out of boredom waiting at different places and I started to get into it more and more.  Now, to quote my kids, &quot;Your obsessed with that game!!&quot;  I love it!  Sometimes you just have to give things a chance!
B00DGGIXS6|4.0|Love Cher Love. Some gay dance song writer on coke wrote the songs for the first half of this CD. Songs for Hell. So very many lyrics. This is not &#34;Believe.&#34; Toward the middle Cher hits her stride and sounds like Cher. Her voice is so poignant it brought tears to my eyes and held me rapt. The song &#34;Sirens&#34; is beautiful. Worth the price of the entire CD. I've always loved Cher's voice. Streisand used to say of herself, &#34;I'm an actress who sings.&#34; She's a singer who acts. Cher is an actress who sings. An interpretive singer, par excellence. And an Award winning actress. The last half of this album proves it. Even the disco songs are beautifully sung. On these Cher's voice sounds like drops of Summer rain. Love Cher.Love
0142405809|5.0|Rarely does a book for little ones hit top marks on the three things that matter most, but this one does - 1) vibrant, clear, colorful and engaging drawings, 2) rhymes that really connect, with strong measures, sophisticated structure, and emphasis and flow that works whether read silently or out loud, 3) a heart warming story with multiple positive messages, (self reliance, friendship, resourcefulness, nerve, imagination, and a general sense of generous good heartedness).<br /><br />Perfect for bedtime, the story starts calmly, leads our snail and whale friends through interesting and exciting adventures, then turns into a rescue drama, moves on to a happy ending, and then winds down with a calm upbeat conclusion. I can feel the grandchild drifting off with a happy smile as the story concludes. Plenty to look at, lots to think about - just a solid, satisfying, engaging and rewarding read for both your youngster and, possibly, you. A very nice choice.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|Love this movie.  It's one of my favorite movies.  It's a cute story for young and old.  Has a very nice story to it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is so addicting. It helps make the time fly really fast. Amazing game, and it gets easier to get a higher score a lot faster by completing the missions. All in all, this IS WORTH 5 STARS !!!!!
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|It amused me in so many ways but in not so many words. Only five more words left. Yes hoo!
B0073XV2W2|4.0|Mr. Saurez is the love child of Ton Clancy and Michael Crichton.<br />He pushes the limits of what's possible, but not by much.<br />Good read.
0142501123|5.0|A great children's book! Filled with words for &#34;newly able to read&#34; kids. The illustrations are charming filled with character. A great book for the whole family to enjoy. Easily a Halloween favorite!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|LOVE THE WAY JOJO MOYES WRITES.  GREAT CHARACTERS AND STORIES. I HAD READ &#34;THE GIRL YOU LEFT BEHIND&#34; AND ENJOYED THAT SO MUCH I DECIDED TO READ THIS ONE.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Have injoyed the game and it limits time. Time limits help when children play. I like figuring. out how it works. It's fun to compete with friends.
B0000844M8|5.0|A sad, and at the same time a joyful and a very colorful life story of a magnificent lioness named Elsa...heartening...
B00G4I1CLS|5.0|What a moving story! Sadness filled my emotions when the true story of Seaworld was revealed! What an amzing insight into how lies are covered with more lies....all for the fun and entertainment.....all for MONEY and GREED! How can we sit here in the comfort of our homes and support these abusive and enslaving entertainment companies.
B002ZCDR88|5.0|Listening to this 2 CD set was a finely crafted, educational, and profoundly touching experience. In the little hardcover booklet the lives of the poets are woven with the lyric lines that Natalie has set to music. I would listen to 3 or 4 on rising and one would always touch me deeply. The poems/songs are rendered in different musical styles. The credit list includes dozens of musicians and instruments, no redundancy here. Merchant's unique voice ties it all together, her haunting style perfect for such material, taking us into the fantastic and the confusing and the renewed perspectives of childhood. I would have loved to have this when MY children were- well, children. My grandkids will get a copy, though. And I can't stress enough that adults are often in sore need of poetry and its healing qualities, more than children, who don't usually have the experience to bring to the table.
B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|Great music, plain and simple. Lot's of variety in the music. At least 5 or 6 songs could chart. Gaga has a great voice and it shines in this album !
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Good adaptation of the book. A number of inconsistencies (like where the MockingJay pin came from), but a very fair attempt. I'm looking forward to the rest of the series on video.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|A pleasant surprise. A beguiling story that keeps the reader enchanted until the unexpected end. I have recommended this book to friends and family. It would be an entertaining selection for a book club discussion.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|Just as magical as I remembered as a kid - I watched this with my 8 year old (her first time) this last weekend and we both enjoyed it immensely.  I so appreciated the creativity of the story (jumping into chalk drawings, riding carousel horses in a derby race, laughing yourself up to the rooftop, nannies being blown away by the wind) and the slower pacing (current movies are overwhelmingly frantic by comparison).  Nobody shot or punched or killed - so refreshing!  This is truly a movie made for kids, but also to be enjoyed by adults.
B003B96AOW|5.0|GREAT FOR COLLECTORS. SUPER DETAIL AND QUALITY. GREAT FOR DISPLAY. NOT FOR LITTLE KIDS IF YOU WANT IT FOR COLLECTOR REASONS.
B009S33I68|5.0|Details of War so precise! Makes you realize what the young soldiers faced. Viet Nam was a terrible time for us.
0062060562|5.0|On the edge of my seat each moment. Well written! Ironically, it could happen...and just might...hopefully not to you or anyone you know.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really like this game its a WAY better version of subway suffers. Also it has way more details and little things you don't notice but you know they are there.
0425252868|5.0|Not sure what to add to all the other reviews, but truly a great book and a fascinating look into the German Air Force and how they struggled with a losing war and the demands/threats of the Nazi party.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works Brilliantly. I was up an running, from unpack to streaming Netflix from my laptop to TV in about 5 minutes.
