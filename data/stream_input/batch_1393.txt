0439023513|5.0|I felt that this was an excellent way to end the trilogy.<br /><br />With the first two leaving me feeling somewhat happy and optimistic for Katniss, Mockingjay sure took me for a ride.<br /><br />After reviewing comments from fellow readers, I am quite disappointed that many readers did not enjoy the book as much as I did.<br /><br />Kudos to you, Suzanne.<br /> I look forward to reading some of your other novels.
0143119680|5.0|I'm 3/4 done with the book and decided to look up the author and I am sooo happy to see that there will be another book continuing the story. I have been dreading the ending of this book I love it that much! I wake up looking forward to getting on the subway to begin reading and getting lost in the story of Diana and Michael. The writing is filled with wonderful history, obviously, and the love story is something we all dream of - and I'm a woman in my 50's in case you are wondering. GREAT story telling and I highly recommend this book. Anne
0307949486|2.0|I was really ready for a good thriller and mystery. Well, it didn't happen here. I found myself skipping through the endless monotony. The second half of the book wasn't bad. But the first half, I had to make myself stick with it. The only interesting character is the girl. The man, I couldn't even make myself like. Save yourself some time and skip this one.
B004D0YB4Y|4.0|Real sixties Stax/Atlantic soul has been pronounced dead for a few decades now but with the meteoric rise of Daptone that claim can be shoved back into the ground for hopefully a long time. Charles Bradley is the latest perfect offering coming out of their studios. The man's soulful voice seems lifted out of the Memphis studios into the cradle of the warm Dap King sound. Horns that soulfully blow on `Golden Rule', a female chorus gospelling the chorus on `I Believe In Your Love' or the hammond's staccato riff  on `Trouble in the Land' that also features a beautiful hornriff making you wish they would have made it a 5 minute instrumental and not a 1 minute interlude. `Lovin' You Baby' is the real classic 60's song which could have been sung by Percy Sledge. Soul is still coming back!
B004L35GAQ|2.0|If you are considering buying this album because you heard \\"Sail,\\" on the radio, then save your money. \\"Sail,\\" is a gross misrepresentation of the album as a whole. I bought this album under the impression that AWOLNation was a dark, industrial, alternative rock band with brooding lyrics and a gritty sound, but instead they sound more like pop. It sounds much more upbeat than I expected and \\"Sail,\\" is an anomoly that just doesn't seem to fit with the rest of the album. They sound a bit like Snow Patrol at times, but with more positive lyrics like Colby Caillat. It sounds interesting sure, but it's actually pretty dumb. \\"Sail,\\" is great, the rest of the album - not so much.
B005LAJ23A|3.0|My problem with this show is, I HATE ALL OF THE CHARACTERS!!! Seriously, I find myself sitting on the couch and cheering for the zombies, which I am pretty sure is not the way it's supposed to go down. But as the show has progressed over both parts of Season 2, I keep hating so many of the characters more and more. In fact, the only characters I am mildly rooting for this season are Glen, Darryl, and maybe Carl...that's about it. Everyone else is a stupid you-know-what, and I want the zombies to eat their brains!!! (Most hated character this season: Lori Grimes, hands down. She is such a *^#&(!!! And her parenting skills make Betty Draper from \\"Mad Men\\" look like Mother of the Year. I'm just sayin'.)<br /><br />I guess you could say that my frustration is what Season 2 is all about. The zombie apocalypse continues, obviously, and virtually every character begins to lose it at some point (especially Shane...you have no idea). Ultimately, though, they all still piss me off, and I want them all to die and for the zombies to take over the world. And some of these moronic characters do die this season...and it's unexpected and AWESOME!!! Sadly, though, many of them will live to see Season 3. BUMMER. :(<br /><br />Without giving anything away, here is my take on this: the first half of Season 2 was a bit disappointing. I thought the overall pacing of the show was slower than Season 1. The same thing happened in the second half of Season 2, and then the last 10 minutes of the second-to-last episode of the season were AMAZING, and then the season finale kind of sucked. I will watch Season 3, but I really hope things pick up a bit and that these characters get their acts together. Otherwise, I will find myself rooting for the zombies 100% of the time!
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|I had downloaded this game on my tablet and I got to play it for one session.  Then it tells me that it isn't installed and it won't let me re install it.  It always fails on the installation.  I am very unhappy with this because I happened to like this game.

1400069181|5.0|This book tells the story of TOMS Shoes while offering practical advice for starting a new business. A unique business model is presented that put giving at the core of every decision a new business makes. Blake Mycoskie spins a beautiful tale of passion and humanity. The story of TOMS shoes is truly inspirational and worthy of print. Mycoskie goes on to outline best practices for starting a small business. I found this book to be interesting, relevant, and inspirational even though my career has nothing to do with business ownership. In the end, this book was a wonderful read.

B001TOD92C|4.0|Aronofsky's glimpse into the grim reality of retirement in pro wrestling is a tough, fair rumination on a physically unforgiving industry. Not as suicidally dark as Requiem for a Dream, but it doesn't need to be - where Requiem was about a self-destructive quest for the taste of an elusive high, The Wrestler is more interested in the shattered figure trying to cope with the repercussions of that lifestyle. Mickey Rourke nails the role of Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson, as advertised; the conflicting emotions of hope, guilt, desperation and cheap indulgence that flash across his face speak volumes when the character has very little to say for himself. Marissa Tomei is nicely cast as his counterpart, a stripper running into identical problems; aging in an industry that relies almost exclusively on one's superficial gifts. I didn't care for the ambiguous ending and found the in-ring scenes to be jumpy and weak, but loved the rich characterization, deep respect for the subject and long, unspoken history that precedes the events of the film.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! Loved it and can't wait to see the movie! I highly recommend this series!
B0057ZAA6W|5.0|It's amazing to think this was vilified for glamorizing drug use at the time of its release, because it's as stirring an anti-drug sentiment as I've ever seen. Ewan McGregor gets his breakout role as the weak-willed heroin-addicted poster boy Mark Renton, who constantly surrounds himself with a gaggle of the worst friends money can buy. It's a thousand different emotions all rolled into one concise package, with a dozen scenes that had me laughing out loud, an equal number of gut punches, a few manic spurts of action, a load of excellent off-the-cuff conversations and one giant, trainwrecked final score. A nonstop, chaotic adventure with a well-rounded cast of characters and a knack for extreme moods, it's occasionally tough to discern the dialog thanks to the abundance of thick Scottish accents. Several outstanding selections on the soundtrack unify the scattered emotions very nicely.
B004TTMYQG|1.0|I've been using BC for about a year now. But recently, a major buff with its widgets has rendered the app nearly useless to me. I am positive, after exhaustive testing, that BC is in fact the culprit. After assembling the bug report, and sending to the developer, I have received no response in 2 weeks. I asked for a simple acknowledgment of receipt, as I was also ignored the first time I sent a bug report about 6 months ago. The developer should be grateful for this kind of feedback!
B006DRVFRQ|4.0|I use Google reader daily, and I also use the starring system for saving articles to read later, and as reference. Most reader apps ( and I have tried many) focus on a pretty interface or customization of text format, rather than how the app actually works.
B004EPZ07K|1.0|Everything is wrong with this movie. It's SUPER SERIOUS like one of the new Nolan \\"Batman\\" movies. Then the Green Lantern uses his powers and it's very silly, like something from \\"Roger Rabbit.\\" A runaway helicopter is settled onto a racecar and a track built in mid-air for it to run along. To fight a giant monster cloud, he boosts up a fuel truck on giant springs and then shoots it with an anti-aircraft gun. A number of the visuals and science feel borrowed from Ang Lee's \\"Hulk\\" while there are story references to the original \\"Superman.\\" In \\"Superman,\\" though, you know the director really loved the comic book. In \\"Green Lantern,\\" everything feels like they were worried people would think the Green Lantern mythology was too silly and outer space, so they just tried to make it as realistic as possible and never embraced the big cosmic themes and feel.<br /><br />\\"Superman,\\" it is not.
1451627289|1.0|I was just looking through the glowing reviews for this book, and can't help but think, \\"Really?!\\"  What am I missing?  This was a tedious read.  Took me quite a while to get through it, because it was BORING.  Save yourself the trouble.  I wish I had.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Such a great book!  A lot of very interesting information which most people don't know anything about.  Wheat is something that I no longer touch!  Thank you for sharing the facts.
1612130283|5.0|Let me start this by saving I hate to read and if I do it takes me about 1 - 2 months to finish one book.  I read all three books to this trilogy in a week!  This is an amazing story from start to finish.  This is a book you cant put down cause you want to know what's next.  Highly recommend this trilogy to anyone to read.  You will enjoy it and might end up with a kinky thought or two to try later at home.  ;-)
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I could not wait to read this book based on the high demand and fun/sexual topic. Right off the bat I was hooked on the story as an easy read. However, some things drove me crazy once I got into it:<br />-A 22 year old college student doesn't have, let alone know how to use, a computer? That's ridiculous. I graduated recently (from a state school mind you) and 95% of people had a computer. 99.9% were required to know how to use one.<br />-I guess it's part of the fantasy idea, but she has literally NO sexual experience? Come on.<br />-How many times is the writer going to use \\"gray eyes\\" for Mr. Grey and have Anastasia say \\"Holy crap!\\" or similar? THAT gets really irritating. The author could use a thesaurus more frequently, and also maybe talk more like a 22 year old woman.<br /><br />Overall, worth picking up for an easy and fun read, but don't expect a great literary piece.
B007JRU2UK|5.0|There is 90 seconds of film where George Clooney is not on the screen. But don't worry, he narrates for us so we don't forget he is in the film. His wife Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie) has a boating accident we don't get to see because Clooney wasn't there. She is in a coma and is going to die. Clooney has been so involved with his job (he has a big deal in the works) that he has alienated himself from his family. Now he is attempting to reconnect with his two daughters, the older of which has harsh feelings for her mother.<br /><br />The story develops to a point where Elizabeth's coma becomes almost secondary. Clooney's deal involves all of his cousins and a realtor Clooney would rather not deal with for personal reasons. In order to help her cope, the older daughter Alexandra (Shailene Woodley) has a boyfriend (Nick Krause) who hangs out with her during this interim.<br /><br />The movie is a drama, but the dysfunctional family provides for light humor and some dark humor to keep the film from getting too heavy. Good acting. Well written and directed. Film is really great if you like the color blue: blue skies, blue water, blue Hawaiian shirts...and Clooney.<br /><br />F-bomb, no sex or nudity. 4 1/2 stars.
B000JLQSW4|5.0|I bought the original CD release of the whole Alan Parsons Project catalog, and one thing that always bothered me was how SOFT they sounded compared to newer albums. Yes, there is the ongoing debate about the so-called \\"loudness wars\\" with mastering, but the original CDs were just plain soft sounding. These new remastered releases sound the proper volume compared my other discs, and they still retain all of the details and precision that Alan is known for! The bonus tracks are entertaining for true fans of the albums (like me...), but they are not essential listening. All in all, a great product. 5 stars.

B006SMLAMQ|5.0|The information was very useful and informative. It has provided exactly what I was looking for in a weather app.
B006SMLAMQ|3.0|The app has HD background photos which don't make sense.  Sunset at 23:00hrs if i'm not mistaken is 11pm?  Sun would be set by then.  Also there is only 24hr time and there are no settings at all that u can change, what you get is what you get.  Also no detailed weather or alerts of any kind.  Mostly useful if you want a weather forecast and nothing else.  Get weather.com weather app its 10times better.
B006SMLAMQ|2.0|There's no widgets! What's the point in a weather app with no widgets? I don't want to open an app to see the weather, I want to glance at my screen. Uninstalling. Glad I didn't pay anything for this, but now it'll sir there cluttering up my purchased app list... oh well.

B003O86FMW|2.0|Okay, I'm not a fan of the fantasy genre (killer squirrels, talking birds, natural disasters summoned by invisible villains).  I read this at the recommendation of two friends, both of whom LOVED it.<br /><br />I found the narrative uninspired, the dialogue unconvincing and the story incomplete (I know-I know; it's one of a series, all of which taken together tell the story, but...still...).  The authoress does get an A+ for imagination, but that's about it.  If you're a chick who likes books about vampires or magical trolls (no, there're neither in this book, but it's in that style), you'll probably like it (as millions of others have--it's a 5-Star bestseller).  But for ME...I believe I'll find something else and not bother with the others in this series.
0374275637|4.0|Readers who like to think about thinking will enjoy Daniel Kahneman's book, Thinking Fast and Slow. This Nobel winner elucidates his own research about how the mind works and comments on the insights of other researchers. The title refers to the ways in which our brain leads us toward quick and lazy decisions that are almost automatic versus the harder and slower thinking work that requires greater effort. Kahneman describes his decades of research in a readable style that most readers will find interesting and enlightening. Fans of behavioral economics will find this book to be delightful reading.<br /><br />Rating: Four-star (Highly Recommended)

006197806X|4.0|Okay, I have to start by saying that I truly did enjoy this book. It was a nice follow-up to DELIRIUM, and I'm just as eager to read REQUIEM as I was this one. PANDEMONIUM is filled with excellent characters, creative plot lines and deep emotion.<br /><br />But, there are a couple of things I actually didn't like about it. (I know, I know...please don't stone me to death!)<br /><br />First off, no Alex. :(<br /><br />That's right. The soulful, brilliant, charming Alex from DELIRIUM is all but non-existent throughout 99.9% of PANDEMONIUM. I understand the reason--a reason expertly shown through Lena's pain and heartbreak over her loss--but it didn't make Alex's absence hurt any less. One of the best things about DELIRIUM was the building relationship between Lena and Alex, and it was by far the thing I was looking forward to most in the sequel. So to say I was disappointed with this aspect is putting it mildly.<br /><br />Second...the jump between THEN and NOW.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I love when chapters alternate between characters or settings. And sometimes, even jumping from one time to another can be fun. But I was excited for the story to pick up right where it left off. Normally I don't even blink when the second book in a series jumps ahead (I do that myself in my own writing, so I completely get it) to move the plot to a more stable point for book two. But that final, heart-pounding, almost seizure-inducing scene in DELIRIUM was so intense and frantic and totally out of left field, I was desperate to find out what happened next. Unfortunately, we never got to \\"see\\". We were told through Lena's memories and pain (beautifully done, btw) of that fateful night, but the action and emotion I felt when I finished the last page of book one wasn't there. And I missed it!<br /><br />Also, there was a time gap from THEN to NOW, which took some of the tension (IMO) from the THEN chapters. Kind of like when the main character begins telling their story with \\"Thisis about the night I almost died\\"or something similar. On page one, I know how the story ends...so why read it? (note: that did not happen with this book--I enjoyed every page!)<br /><br />I know you're probably thinking that after such a downtrodden review, his rating is going to stink! Well you can rest easy...I happily give PANDEMONIUM 4 stars. Though a tad different in its style, PANDEMONIUM is still a beautifully written novel full of all the things that make fiction great. And as I said at the beginning of this review, I'm just as excited to read REQUIEM. Particularly after that final page! ;P
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This app is great.  I think what I love the most is that you can lock your notes if desired with a password!
B005MMJ84K|5.0|Like I do with all good books, as soon as I finished Delirium, I pre-ordered Pandemonium on my Kindle. Usually when I hype myself up for a book, I am miserably disappointed. And I can officially say, this is NOT one of those cases. Pandemonium was absolutely wonderful! This whole series is seriously just blowing it out of the water for me. Something just puts me in the setting of this book and reels me in and lets me feel every single emotion. I definitely recommend this series to people of all ages. It's a dystopian society that I can see becoming real. And trust me, the last word of this book will have you on the edge of your seat for the next installation. =)
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|The Oscars have since rewarded Woody Allen with Best Screenplay for Midnight in Paris, and deservedly so. The film opens with a montage of Parisian scenes that is visually exquisite; all the famous landmarks that point to why Paris is one of the most beautiful cities in the world. The background music is soft, blues jazz and a perfect fit. If it's been a while since your last visit to Paris, or if you have yet to experience this marvelous city, I believe you will feel compelled to remedy that situation. After the gorgeous visual/musical intro we're carried on to a classic Woody Allen film. Watching Owen Wilson in the lead role is reminiscent of every character Woody Allen played. The two men seem disparate but not in this film, Mr. Allen's characteristics and vocal rythms seem to be channeled through Owen Wilson. The supporting cast, major and minor, all shine, no doubt due to Mr. Allen's written word. The fun of a Woody Allen film is you are encouraged to use your imagination too; take the film at face value as a lark, or delve a little deeper. Make what you will of this little tale of time travel, real or imagined, and listen for the voiced conclusion, whether you agree, or not. In the meantime let yourself revel in Paris in the 20's meeting all the artistic greats of that era. To those of us who are fans of Woody Allen this movie is a must have for the DVD library and to those who haven't been captured by the charm of a Woody Allen movie this little gem will surely draw you in.
B005J29HCQ|5.0|Smile is a wonderful (excuse the pun) slice of Americana which paints a sonic landscape of agrarian life in America, circa the 1800s. This album exhibits the true song writing and production genius of Brian Wilson, with its complex vocal harmonies, lush production, recurring musical themes and the brief, musical segues, smoothly connecting the major songs on the album.  It should be noted that the lyricist on this album was Van Dyke Parks, with whom Brian Wilson worked once again with on the Orange Crate Art album from the 90s. Mr. Parks also provided the jangling piano on the Mojo Men's version of the song, \\"Sit Down I Think I Love You\\" as well as working with Harpers Bizarre.  Those who like albums with full production and diverse instrumentation should check out his esoteric classic album, Song Cycle from 1968.  A strange but beautiful classic in its own right. Smile was to be the album to directly challenge the Beatles' Sergeant Peppers album (and it's just about as good!). However, because of Brian Wilson's personal demons, he admitted defeat toward his British competitors, Paul McCartney and The Beatles. As a result, the album never materialized but got shelved for 44 years instead. However, some song remnants appear on the Beach Boys Box set from the early 90s as well as some \\"bootleg\\" discs.  Songs such as \\"Heroes and Villains,\\" \\"Vegetables,\\" \\"Wind Chimes\\" \\"Wonderful,\\" and the venerable classic, \\"Good Vibrations\\" were found, in slightly different form, on the ersatz counterpart album to \\"Smile,\\" called \\"Smiley Smile.\\"  The songs, \\"Our Prayer\\" and \\"Cabinessence\\" made their way to the 1969 Beach Boys album, 20/20.  The beautiful and haunting song, \\"Surf's Up\\" became the title of the 1971 Beach Boys album of the same name.  Some of the highlight songs include \\"Heroes and Villains,\\" \\"Wonderful,\\" \\"Cabinessence\\" (with the vocal doe-ing doe-ings in the background), \\"Good Vibrations,\\" (this version adding a bit more production in the latter half of the song) and myall time favorite Beach Boys song, \\"Surf's Up\\" with its various tempo and style changes.  Lyrical themes include woodworking, farming, cantinas, Native Americans, carting off vegetables for the market, the Grand Cooley, and the elements, referencing the Great Chicago Fire and \\"Cool, Cool Water.\\"  Both lyrics and music conjure up a halcyon mood of simpler times in the past.<br /><br />It would have been interesting to see how \\"Smile\\" would have fared, had it been released the Spring of 1967.  Perhaps it would have become the bellwether of rock music rather than Sgt. Peppers!?<br /><br />This album is a must for all Beach Boys fans as well as for lovers of euphonious music, exquisite vocal harmonies and lyrical, Americana topics.  While Brian Wilson's solo, 2004 version of \\"Smile\\" was excellent, the original \\"Smile\\" can't be surpassed, primarily because of Brian Wilson's more youthful voice.  Truly, a paragon pop album, worthy of 5 stars!

B006SMLAMQ|5.0|Both my husband and I really like this app.  We both have Amazon accounts so it was purchased under two different accounts.  We both have Toshiba Thrive tablets and installed the app on them and did have an anomaly in that on his tablet the widgets were immediately available under the widget section and on mine they were not.  I had to turn my tablet off and then back on to have the widgets shown to be available.  If you don't immediately see the widgets, you might want to give this a try before thinking the app doesn't have them.<br /><br />If one wants to use the widgets the app can't be moved to the SD card or they won't be available.  I believe this has to do with the Android OS, rather than something in the control of the developer.  We elected just to use the app on our tablets due to size and not install on our phones.<br /><br />Granted we haven't had the app really long enough to see how we feel after more long term use but from what we can observe at this time...it receives 5 stars from both of us.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|This was one of my first FAotD, and back then I had rated it poorly due to permissions and app size.  It took a couple of weeks before I realized why it was so big: it had a tremendous amount of content and programming.<br /><br />Few games have made me so happy to have.  In my not-so-humble opinion this game is worth every penny even if they were actual copper.  Seriously, this game ROCKS!<br /><br />So, you are asking why I dinged it a star?  The main reason is that it is missing some interesting and good content from the PC version (TOTALLY worth the bucks!).<br /><br />But yeah, I'm now a fan of this game in a big way.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a great little story.  It explores some very interesting post-apocalyptic themes.  I wish it would have dwelt on those a tad more, instead of being more action oriented.

0307408833|4.0|Wonderful book, but not for the novice.  If you are used to Betty Crocker, the ingredients list will read like Greek.  If you rely on precise measurements, you will very likely end up with a disappointing final product.  But if you consider yourself a pretty well-versed baker and are looking for a new twist on some old favorites (or by no other choice are forced to look for a new method due to dietary and/or health restrictions), this book is actually really fun and eye-opening.  The chocolate coconut icing is surprisingly delicious, the double chocolate chip cookies are super tasty (add a little extra flax and be generous on the measurements of flour), and I have adapted the super tasty scone recipe to a number of different flavors of scones--all delicious.  The most notable thing about all the recipes is how NOT dessert-coma'd you feel after you eat any of them--the sweetness never gets to you to the point where you can't take another bite (maybe that's not a good thing?) and none of the treats sit in your stomach all day like the  butter-rich ones you get at the local bakery or coffee shop.  The downsides--1) The ingredients list is overwhelming if you haven't spent a good amount of time in a health foods store or organic market. 2) She relies heavily on the Bob's Red Mill All-Purpose Mix.  I have always found this mix to give off a notable aftertaste (likely due to the bean flours) that is not always palatable to those who aren't used to the \\"gluten free\\" taste.  There are much better-tasting all-purpose mixes on the market, I would prefer to try her recipes with an alternative mix (though I have not yet, so I can't offer suggestions).  3) Other than the icing, there is not a single recipe in my book that does not have notes scribbled in the margin regarding tweaked measurements.  She stresses in the book to follow her measurements PRECISELY... and yet, when I did, the final product was far from perfect in consistency every time (especially the cookies).  Not tosay there's anything wrong with learning from your \\"oops!\\" baking moments, but you would expect more care to be taken given her stern instructions at the beginning of the book.  All in all, I feel it is a great book that will offer the open mind some new techniques and great recipes... as long as you know you may to take a few missteps in the process.
0553801473|1.0|I was very disappointed in this book.<br /><br />The plot doesn't develop significantly, but that is not my main criticism.<br />I can see what Martin is doing with the story, and I appreciate it.<br />It is a build-up, every story needs that.<br /><br />What lost me was the world-building.<br />Way too many \\"characters\\" and \\"cultures\\".<br />Endless lists of names and relations.<br />What am I reading, a family tree?  Or a travel guide?<br /><br />I can see why the author might think this makes the world bigger and more realistic etc, but it fails.  Why am I wasting my time reading about hundreds of irrelevant not-even-secondary \\"characters\\"?  Answer: I'm not.  I had to do the unthinkable and skim through this verbiage.  If you are a speed-reader, this is the perfect book to practice on.  I suspect Martin likes to make his readers suffer but I think he even failed at that here.  Instead of suffering I skipped.<br /><br />Pros: I enjoyed the descriptions of feasts - Jordan is a pro at that, and it makes my mouth water to read.  The early Tyrion chapters were a nice diversion.  I enjoyed the Theon plot arc, although it was horrifying.  The opening of his first chapter hit me unexpectedly, and my stomach still roils thinking about it.  Props to that, Martin, you got me.  I was not expecting that.  I also had some fun digging back into the 2nd and 3rd book to find out who \\"Reek\\" was.<br /><br />However, in the end, the book just wasn't believable.  The motivations and decisions of many characters felt forced.  For instance, why would the Boltons want Reek to listen in on their secret/personal talks?  Why, for the author to give the reader some juicy info.  Add in silly cliffhangers concluding each chapter, new POVs (more scenery, more setup, more verbiage), and cut-aways from action, and the book had me scratch my head thinking \\"huh?\\" instead of \\"that's amazing!\\" like the previous books.<br /><br />It's staggering how this series went from a focused dramatic saga to a recital of minutiae.  Martin must have gotten convinced along the way that the world-building was the best part of his books, because he's delved into that headfirst, trying to grow the world so large that it absorbs every possible name, event, history, etc.  But it just becomes encyclopedic in nature instead of dramatic, and all the superfluous stuffing smothers the story.<br /><br />I laughed at my friends who had been suckered into Jordan's pointless world.<br />Joke is on me this time.  A Feast for Crows was superior to this book, at least the author's voice was confident.  A Dance with Dragons reads like a stunted and rickety mess.<br /><br />I am unsure whether to continue with this series.  Just because one of the books is bad doesn't mean all hope is lost.  But I am a little worried that with all the extra plot threads, I'll have no idea who is who and what is what next go round, and that the author will undoubtedly throw in hundreds more unnecessary characters.  There is just too much here, and little of it is interesting, and I only have so many brain cells to devote to fictional worlds.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Martin, it seems wants to write thousands of words in order to get his point across.  He is overly descriptive and repents a person's titles to the point of completely boring the hell out of me.  His books build up the so called good guy and then suddenly for no reason kills them off, while the so called bad guys get away with murder.  His books would be much better if he would cut cut down on trying to stretch the book(s) with extra unneeded words. Had a Junior HS English teacher that called us of words, like firing a Blunderbuss. After saying all that I would like to see which bad guys wins in the end and it will probably be the Imp!

B007JRU2UK|1.0|I cannot understand what all the hype for this movie is based on. The story has potential, and easily could have produced a riveting movie; and of course the location shots in Hawaii are gorgeous. But except for Beau Bridges and the girl who played the older daughter, the acting in this movie is completely unconvincing. Particularly disappointing is Clooney's performance. He plays a character going through a huge life crisis, which includes the unexpected death of his wife and having to decide himself when to pull the plug, the discovery that she cheated on him and having to face the \\"other man\\", having to resolve a multi-million dollar family trust which has significant historical and environmental implications, and suddenly having to raise two daughters who had been looked after pretty much solely by their mother. This is a  character struggling though real difficulties. But from Clooney's performance, you would never know it. He whines a lot, but never convincingly projects the pain his character is experiencing; and so, as a result, we don't really care. I am a fan of Clooney's, and have seen all his movies. This one, I regret, doesn't work.

B007M6P01O|4.0|+++++SPOILERS+++++++++++<br /><br />Michonne, finally! And perhaps even cooler than her initial appearance in the comics. Speaking of the comics, I'll take a stand based on both them and the show: Rick is not that great a leader. Admittedly, I agree with his statements at the end of the episode: sure, there should be one leader who gives orders to prevent mass dissention and disagreement from corroding any kind of societal balance. I just don't think he's a good choice to be that person. Aside from his horrid parenting (just keep the loaded gun you STOLE from someone else, thereby endangering TWO people at the very least, and probably the whole group, you cute little psychopath you) he actually chose not to tell everyone there was a threat in their midst! What if, say Lori and Carl, were out walking and Carl randomly fell and died. She would be grief stricken... right up until his corpse reanimated. Or, maybe she could carry the body back to the group before it started ripping out throats. Right there, you sir, are not a good choice to lead. You kept people from knowing key information that could have saved their lives. I get that the others simply don't want the burden of leadership, even Randall's fate wasn't really an argument to get choked up over (I wouldn't have at least), but I wouldn't just blindly follow what Rick had to say  either. His decisions are questionable, to say the least. If you were driving for an hour in the red why didn't you mention it sooner, with daylight left to do something about it, and why aren't you taking into account other people's opinions? I guess I'm more with T-Dog's line of thinking: I'll stick with you people until something better comes along. In the time since Rick has joined the group no one has made any long-term good decisions, no fortifications, early warning systems, scouting parties, I would settle for even just basic armor. Seriously, wear a winter coat if you're going near walkers! (I take that back, they did it oncein Season 1, then forgot what a good idea it is.)<br /><br />Even so, all in all, the show is certainly back on track and actually making progress. Glad they took out those two people who I had to stop and think, wait, who are you two again? Otis's wife I think? Even Lori, whiny as she is, moves the story along. (Was she actually upset and disgusted with Rick for killing a man in self-defense who was himself a murderer, twice that we know of? Now I see why Carl is both so annoying and such a powder keg if she's been this patchwork crazy all his life.)<br /><br />And here's a question, how many times does your camp/holdout/bar/farm need to be attacked and overrun before you stop and think, hey, maybe we need a back-up meeting place with provisions in case something totally unlikely happens, like a zombie horde migrating through, tearing down our nonexistent defenses? With any luck the momentum they've built over the second half of this season will carry on through to the next. I'm all for some Michonne, Abraham, and Governor action.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its an ok game that's a good time killer. Some games are pretty fun but others seem pretty hard (which some.people might like).
B007J4T2G8|2.0|No good plot....or substance. Just a cheesy love story. A Harlequin with soft porn. Always involves good looking rich guy. Not original. Total waste of time. Buy a penthouse for better writing.<br /><br />If you don't think men abusing women is a turn on...you wont like this book.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was a STELLAR read that pulled me in right away and has me eager for the rest of the story coming in hinted at sequels. I had never heard of the author before this purchase, but will certainly be watching for him from now on!<br /><br />To add on, I have since read everything Hugh Howey has written, and WOW!  This is destined to be classic literature that sci-fi fans will be telling their kids to read 20 years from now.  Howie's name will likely end up alongside the greats: Asimov, Heinlein... That's how incredible his character development, scene setting, and over-all writing style truly are.  From the start you will identify, relate, and ultimately come to love the characters of this story, and will take their losses and gains as your own.  The worlds that Howie creates (in all of his writing) have a depth that few other authors can dream of.  His characters become real people that live in these worlds with you while you read (which by the way you won't want to stop doing).  Thank you Mr. Howie for the tremendous talent that you have shared with us, and keep them coming!

B006OFN0SE|2.0|Every cliché of biographical movies is in \\"J. Edgar.\\" Even HBO isn't making such on-the-nose tripe as this anymore. The framework is simplistic, J. Edgar Hoover is writing his memoirs and the movie is told in flashback as he recalls his life. Then, a re-enactment of moments in Hoover's life happen that never go deeper than what you would find on Hoover's Wikipedia page until it addresses his alleged homosexuality. There are parts of this in the second half of the movie that are affecting and pretty good, mostly when relating Hoover and Tolson's relationship in the second half of their lives.  Unfortunately, in the early scenes, Armie Hammer plays Tolson almost as a gay stereotype and does little but announce his limitations as an actor.<br /><br />Nothing new here at all and DiCaprio isn't even that great.

B0034G4P4Y|5.0|I had very low expectations for this film. I don't even remember it being in the theaters. And it was directed by Steven Spielberg! But I was in the mood for something 'adventurous' and so I gave this a try. I was absolutely floored. The animation on its own is worth the viewing and I rarely say that about any film. It is just spectacular. And the story moves along beautifully and it is filled with humor and high adventure and mystery and incredible direction and compelling characters. And the voice work is superb.<br /><br />How this film didn't get more attention and a wider American audience is a mystery to me. I found out, however, that it did achieve amazing success overseas. I am grateful for that because I am hoping these are not the final adventures of Tintin. That would be a shame.<br /><br />This is escapist adventure at its very best. During a year when the Oscars were filled with ho-hum entertainment, this one somehow was overlooked. It is an amazing piece of art and one the whole family can truly enjoy together.
1401937519|5.0|I saw the KPBS TV show with Dr. Wayne Dyer, Wishes Fulfilled, where he brought  Anita Moorjani (the author of this book)on stage to talk.  There was NO question in my mind, to get her book (this one), which I did.  I read it, marked about 200 spots in the book that stood out, and strted passing it along to my friends. Everyone, no matter their religion or faith or lack of, liked it very much. It is inspiring and reassuring and informative. In groups of people, they are also telling people to read it....we ALL are!  Great comfort to understand that the other side of death is a loving place, not to fear at all.  It provides lots of other sources to check out the story told, in case there are any doubts...which I don't have.  I recommend this book to everyone....and maybe we ALL can live our lives without fear, without disease casused by our own minds, and with all the love and appreciation of the true meaning of living, and let go of all the false aspects and asperations of what humans had created on this planet.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|Overall I liked and enjoyed this short book. While I'm a bullet-point kind of reader, pretty much everything here was numbered with the breifest of descriptions. All good stuff, some really good points in fact, but I was left wishing he could have elaborated on them more than a few sentences for each point. Perhaps even some example conversations.
B003TJR2HS|2.0|CableJive has always been a favorite of mine and for 3 1/2 days this was the best dock extender I've used.  I say 3 1/2 days because it worked fine with my Altec Lansing Dock/Speaker and Pandora-One from my iPhone 4.  Half way through the forth day, the volume controls on phone and volume slide on Pandora stopped working and the volume stopped.  A info box popped up on my iPhone advising that the attachment was not compatible with my device.  I turned the phone on/off, uninstalled/reinstalled app... no success! Same info box!  I removed the extenger from the dock and pluged in a extension cable and it worked fine! Not sure what happened... This is a warning, be careful what you buy!

B004MC8CA2|4.0|I have this app on every electronic device I own. I love it even more on my kindle fire because of the size. the only thing I will say I wish it had was a completion screen where it asks if you want to share the day's reading on twitter, facebook, etc.  I would also like the completion page because on one occasion I read a day but for some reason it didn't register with the device that I did and when I reopened the app it took me to the previous day's reading. I never had that issue on my blackberry or ipod. but I still love the app. :)
B005UKJX4E|5.0|This is a problematic film for the uncommitted viewer.  It breaks away from most any narrative-structure known in big film in that it deals with one's perceptions of relationships and TIME--not time as in the duration it takes the hands of your watch to move round.  So, in a way, it's a most subjective enterprise whereby TIME is being observed from within, as times are recalled and/or being lived through.<br /><br />The said relationships are those between Jack, the eldest son of a typical post-WWII American family, and his parents and brothers.  The front relation seems to be the one between Jack and his father(/Father?), the attendant relation is between Jack and a disappeared younger brother.  Throughout, Jacks discovers, and builds on, his relation with the big OUTSIDE one's senses. TIME consists of the remembered times when Jack grew up under his father's authority, besides his brothers, and of the running time of Jack's becoming.  Or, as Malick puts it, time of nature and time of grace, with love as the equalizer.<br /><br />If we are to take apart Malick's film, there is a 3-part structure to it:  The 1st, which lasts until the mother receives the tragic news by mail, is that of the innocent period; The 2nd, until Jack's father admits being overwhelmed if not mistaken, and Jack the adult enters a door-frame into the desert, is a period of growing doubt and tension; The 3rd and final is the resolution.<br /><br />The viewer gets exposed to a long series of beautiful and almost always meaningful shots, while being prompted to an acute awareness to the intensity of the moment.  In addition, Malick's fan club is taken to a new level as expressed by the musical form of this work.  Music becomes another character, this film is music.  Take your time and understand that Malick offers nothing less than a wise perspective on becoming and being, tune yourself to the harmony of life.

B007M6OIF8|5.0|\\"The Walking Dead\\"... last nights finale for season two had some interesting moments.<br /><br />1.) probably the greatest number of zombies in one show for the entire second season.<br /><br />2.) loss of two more members of Hershel's family to the herd.<br /><br />3.) Rick informs the group on the details of Shane's death and also tells them some stunning news regarding the Zombie virus... news he's known but withheld from them since they left the CDC center at the end of season one.<br /><br />4.) a fast paced and harrowing ending... with the survivors just barely surviving and Laura being 'rescued/captured'. We are given brief glimpse at the very end as to what will probably be main locale for season three next fall.<br /><br />5.) overall, great acting bringing a myriad of truly interesting characters to life.<br /><br />6.) my only concern would be the soap opera quality of events that seem to be creeping into the latter shows.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />A great season finale and overall an incredible season two.<br />Best moment of the year... The 'barn' finale at the mid point of the season.<br /><br />5 Stars<br /><br />Ray Nicholson

B0006VBFM0|2.0|I have owned numerous Swatch watches over the years without problems.  I was disappointed with this one.  It stopped working suddenly (mechanism broke inside) and had to return it to be repaired.  I returned it to the seller and it took a ridiculous amount of time to repair (over 8 weeks) and then the face plate was not put on correctly (the 3 was in the position where the 12 should have been) making it difficult to read the time.  I should have returned it again but was reluctant to lose it again for another 8+ weeks.  Now it's not keeping time correctly even though I've changed the battery.  Guess I just got a dud this time...It will unfortunately make me think twice about purchasing another Swatch watch.

0307352145|4.0|Susan Cain'a book \\"Quiet\\" is a long awaited book for people like me, an introvert. It addresses many of the issues and theories on personality and the negative associations with the title of introvert that I've wondered about my whole life.<br /> While the book is full of many great examples of introvert and extroverts and studies done on each group, sometimes it feels as though it isn't being fully explained or biased to make her point about introverts. So while sometimes some of her arguments feel as though they can be contended or are full of fluff, Cain nevertheless brings much needed attention to the subject of introversion.<br />We do indeed live in a society that prizes extroversion and being outgoing. That's why its a great relief to read something so thoroughly researched and well written on the hidden and more quiet people in society. This book is comforting for us introverts, and gives you confidence to be yourself while also being very informative and helpful to extroverts who may look down upon or just not understand introverts. Definitely buy this if you're an introvert, especially if you still beat yourself up about not being as outgoing as your \\"cool, sociable\\" friends who don't understand why you'd prefer to stay in on a Friday night and just read a book. Sadly, I think that mostly introverts will pick this up because it pertains to them, but extroverts should pick it up as well and learn a thing or two about what makes us who we are.

I could not believe Banderas and Hayek actually participated in this!

Enjoyed the family dynamics.<br /><br />One thing I would like to comment on though, is why do people give such lengthy reviews.  I would just like to know if someone recommends a book or not.  I don't need to know the whole plot before I start.  I find a lot of people ruin it with their reviews.  You'd think everyone is a book reviewer for People Magazine or Time Magazine, etc.

B0020EK4QY|3.0|AIR FORCE ONE is a fun movie. It's the kind of action movie where you can suspend your disbelief and just sit back and enjoy. And at the same time this film depicts a President that many of us really wish we actually had in the Oval Office: a politician who can literally kick some ass. Harrison Ford demonstrates that he is still a really good action hero, and is also a great actor. That acting talent goes for the opposite side of the coin in Gary Oldman. Both actors make their performances believable in this movie. Good action movies have to have a great villain. And Oldman definitely provides that in his role.<br /><br />After the successful capture of Radek: a rogue Russian General who has committed genocide on his country's people, U.S. President James Marshall announces to the world in Moscow that America will not tolerate any terrorist organizations. \\"It's your turn to live in fear,\\" he says to the world. His National Security Advisor (Tom Everett), and Chief of Staff (Paul Guilfoyle) are not happy with this change of policy, but the president doesn't back down. Fortunately, his wife (Wendy Crewson), and his daughter (Liesel Matthews) stand by him on this belief.<br /><br />Air Force One takes off from Moscow, heading back to Washington. On board is a Russian news crew who were invited on the trip. But then, everything turns to hell when one of the Secret Service agents (Xander Berkeley) kills his fellow men and unlocks a weapons cache. The news crew reveal themselves to be terrorists and quickly hijack the plane. The Secret Service manage to get the President down to an escape pod, which is jettisoned from the plane before they are killed. The terrorists believe that Marshall had escaped in the pod, and then reveal what they want. They tell the Vice President (Glenn Close) to release Radek, or the hostages will be slaughtered one by one.<br /><br />It turns out that President Marshall released the pod himself and hid himself away. He understands that it is upto him to save the day. And he fights back against the terrorists one by one. Yes, at this point, AIR FORCE ONE has recycled the same plot as CON AIR, DIE HARD, and UNDER SEIGE: terrorists overpower everyone in a specific place, except for one man, who has to save the day. On top of that, it also borrows from the old AIRPORT disaster films of the 70's: something goes wrong, and now we have to get the plane back on the ground.<br /><br />These kind of plots are certainly a cliche. That is true. Done wrong, they can be so incredibly ridiculous as to invite the MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 style wise-cracks. But it's not what kind of plot you use for a movie, it's what you do with it. With AIR FORCE ONE, director Wolfgang Peterson brings in a cast of very gifted actors. Harrison Ford is a great choice as the president. Gary Oldman is not only believable as a villain, he is even given some dialogue that expands on this character. After he shoots a hostage and is called a cold-blooded murderer, he retorts back with this quote: \\"You murdered 100,000 Iraqis just so that you could save on a gallon of gas, and you call me a murderer?\\" It's also a delight to watch Glenn Close as Vice President Bennett in the Situation Room, along with the great character-actors Dean Stockwell as the Secretary of Defense, and Philip Baker Hall as an Attorney General who advices them on what the Constitution says on the issue.<br /><br />Wolfgang Peterson was determined to make the film as realistic as possible. The other terrorists are played by real Russian actors. I recognized one of them: Elya Baskin, from MOSCOW ON THE HUDSON. In that film he was the fellow circus performer and best friend to Robin Williams. (You may also remember him in the SPIDER MAN movies as Peter Parker's landlord.) In the production notes of AIR FORCE ONE the director, production designer, and Harrison Ford all went on a tour of the real plane. This film depicts the jet in almost complete accuracy. Some creative liberties were taken, of course. But for the most part, we can believe that this is what Air Force One looks like. And on top of this, Harrison Ford does all of his own stunts. He was in his mid-fifties when this film came out in 1997, but he was still in great shape. The United States Air Force actually gave full co-operation in making this film, since it's a very positive kind of movie for this military branch.<br /><br />As I said before in the beginning of my review, AIR FORCE ONE is a fun movie. Then-president Bill Clinton loved it. He actually encouraged Glenn Close to play the Vice President before she was cast. I like her, and the other performances. Could such a scenario actually occur on Air Force One? I seriously doubt it. The plane does not have an emergency pod or parachutes in the back. These parts of the film are almost laughable, but it still makes for good entertainment. After seeing this movie, I began to wonder, what if we elected a war hero and Medal Of Honor winner as the President, and ended up with a beautiful woman as The Vice President?
0062082353|5.0|This is a very magnetic story of an American hero that saved many American GI's in war zones. Kyle's determination to excel at what he did, is a story like any other American soldier that commits himself to the American ideals and the American military expectations. The book is a well written story of amazing dedication and tasks that highlight this soldier's career. Buy it and read it!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Steve Jobs praised Bill Gates to Walt Mossberg for having developed, not only products, but a company to discover and market them; as opposed to finding a great thing and then cashing out by selling to someone else. It's hard to develop a company. That's what Jobs did, and I remember thinking at the keynote speech just before he died, that the successors were taking over just fine. Jobs himself wanted to do that in his company, and he did. The story of how he did this is perhaps my favorite element of Isaacson's biography.
B007KQ6XYY|3.0|By the looks of the review it looks like people like it. I would buy it if I had the money
B004T2QZL8|2.0|all you do is combine elements...boring  really. not really sure who this game speaks to, but it is not me.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|...... so stupid its cool and wei okokkkkmkjjjjjjjjj.  iii. iii jj jhvu hvh hvyu hip o rd kinds but smart
B004T2QZL8|4.0|This game has to be my favorite so far on my kindle. It is so addictive. Unfortunately, like most others, it started force closing after a while making it very frustrating and almost impossible to continue. I would really really like to see this issue fixed so I can go back to enjoying this great app.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|I am about to get this game, but after reading the reveiws, I think it is a bad idea.<br />l don't like bugs
B004T2QZL8|1.0|This game is great...for about the first hour. Then the closures start to happen. tried uninstall / reinstall, problem still exists. If fixed would be 5 stars.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Playing this on a Kindle Fire. It's great for killing time when you should be doing other things plus it's free!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great app.love. all of the games. some are super hard. I love the variety.epicness.but I hate all of the damn ads. my fav game is the racing game where you have yo avoid the other cars.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|Wow... This force closes A LOT! Same thing as alchemy, but a little better organization and cute graphics. Really irritated at all the forced closures... Had to take my battery out one time to get my phone to not be frozen. Please fix!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I've had the benefit of reading the first five books in this series over the last year or so.  I can't believe haw hard it would be to keep up with the story if you had been at it over the last decade and a half!<br /><br />Splitting the story in half for books four and five has been interesting, but I would have much preferred the story kept in chronological order.  I spent way to much time worrying about what was going on with the lost characters in book four, and too much effort trying to tie the timeline together in book five.  It will be comforting to have everyone back together again for book six, that is if any characters actually survive that long?<br /><br />This is a grand story, and an engrossing story to follow.  I hope Mr Martin doesn't keep us waiting too long for the conclusion!
0756407125|5.0|For any fan of the fantasy genre - this is masterful work.<br />The author immerses you in a whole detailed world, his artistry of character development, intertwining plot-lines and descriptive places is in a word awesome.<br />I loved the first book in this series just as much as the second, and eagerly await his third!
B004T2QZL8|2.0|This game is great... until you reach THE point. There seems to be a certain point at which, no matter what you do, the app force closes instantly. If fixed, would be a 5 star app.
B003Y5H5F6|5.0|The story was a bit stiff and movie was short but I enjoyed every moment of it especially the end, The action was amazing im hoping the sequel will have a bigger budget the sequel has a chance to be epic
B002R5QPRI|5.0|i got this very quick and just as i ordered.  i would highly reccomend!!service was great and it was exactly as it said
B004T2QZL8|3.0|I like the game but keeps force losing once I got to human.  I wish the would update it soon.
B000UJ48WC|5.0|When I figured out my Top 10 horror movies, The Shining took the top spot. I'm not a fan of campy comedy-horror, so the list is dominated by psychological horror. The Shining is that and a whole lot more. It begins like a drama and takes plenty of time to establish its world, and the majority of the film takes place in the Overlook Hotel.<br /><br />The opening shots are incredible and set the mood. We are shown a car driving along a mountain road. Kubrick sweeps across the countryside so we can see how isolated the Overlook Hotel would be if the only access road was blocked by snow.<br /><br />Jack Torrance (Nicholson) is a recovering alcoholic and he's applying for a winter job as caretaker of the hotel. He'll live there for six months with his wife, Wendy (Duvall), and their young son, Danny (Lloyd).<br /><br />What is shining? It appears to be a form of extrasensory perception. We learn that Danny has the ability and so does the hotel's cook, Dick Hallorann (Scatman Crothers). They can communicate without words. Danny's parents know that he talks to Tony, his imaginary friend, but they aren't aware that he has the shining.<br /><br />I mentioned that the film takes time setting things up. We are shown the hotel in great detail. They live in an apartment inside the hotel and Wendy spends most of her time there. Jack uses one of the large rooms to work on his novel and Danny explores by driving around the halls in his toy car.<br /><br />The film is 32 years old, so spoilers won't be a problem for most people, but stop reading now if you are about to see it for the first time.<br /><br />***Spoiler Alert***<br /><br />The hotel appears to be populated by ghosts. All three people see them while they are alone, so that suggests that the ghosts really do exist. Another explanation would be that all the events are happening inside the mind of one of the characters, or that the hotel itself is 'alive' and remembering some of the events that occurred within its walls. I tend to believe that the ghosts and everything we see is real. That would explain all of the events, including how Jack escapes from a locked room and why Danny has marks on his neck.<br /><br />Time is another factor. Some of the occurrences involve one of the characters visiting the past. Wendy sees guests at a party and Jack interacts with Grady and Lloyd. Sometimes the ballroom is filled with people from the past.<br /><br />Danny's gift is extremely powerful and attracts the attention of Dick when he is 2,000 miles away. Dick's attempts to intervene are significantly different from the story told in Stephen King's book, and Kubrick makes a lot of other changes. I like both versions of the story, but I have to admit that Kubrick's changes played out well on the screen.<br /><br />The dialogue is sparse, but very satisfying at times. I particularly enjoy the exchanges when Jack is talking to Lloyd and Grady. Nicholson is convincing when he acts crazy and the final act shows him at his crazy best. Is his transformation some kind of mental illness, or possession by the spirits that occupy the hotel?<br /><br />The black and white photograph near the end of the film shows Jack attending a 1921 party at the hotel. Grady says at one point that Jack is the caretaker and has always been the caretaker. Is this some kind of living hell? Suppose Jack has had a number of families throughout some kind of supernatural existence and he's been bringing them to the hotel without any previous knowledge of those he has brought there before? He mentions at the start that he's experiencing d&eacute;j&agrave; vu and knows what is around every corner.<br /><br />One shot shows him looking rather demonic. Is he in fact a demon or Satan?<br /><br />What's your take on The Shining? What's your version of the truth?<br /><br />The Blu-ray presentation is one of the best for an older movie. Fans should definitely upgrade.tend to believe that the ghosts and everything we see is real.

B006OCM0G0|5.0|very fun addicting game.  having lots of fun cooking and decorating. lots of fun. like baking story also, play both and have fun
B00003CXMG|5.0|I firmly believe that Almost Famous is a modern-day classic. It is one of my favourite movies of all time and never gets old, regardless of how many times I've seen it. The story takes place in 1973, when real music ruled the world and people turned their love for it into a lifestyle. It's a life I've often fantasized about myself, and I know I'm not alone there. Almost Famous follows 15-year old rock journalist William whose dreams come true when he is asked by Rolling Stone to go on tour with the fictional band Stillwater and write a piece about them.<br /><br />William, the band, and their faithful Band-Aids go through a multitude of emotions over the course of the film. The story is dynamic and offers a lot to the viewer, including a fantastic resolution at the end. The soundtrack isn't too shabby, either. This is the ultimate movie for music lover.
B005KJJ4F8|2.0|I had fun reading this book, but I don't think I'll go for the sequels! It was a little bit too simple for my taste.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|I love everything about this movie. The drama, the humour, the fantasy, the bi and trilingual actors, everything. This is Quentin Tarantino's fantasy of how WWII would have gone down. It's not historically accurate in the slightest, but it sure is fun! Tarantino is such an enthusiastic director and gets so involved with his incredulous movies. I happen to appreciate that, but I know Tarantino's style isn't for everyone.<br /><br />This movie was fantastically done and Cristoph Waltz deserved the Oscar he won for his performance. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes to be genuinely entertained and doesn't mind a little gore. For some who is not familiar with Quentin Tarantino's work, I think this serves as a great introduction to his style.
B004DARF6A|5.0|A couple years back, in 7th grade, during History class, everyone in the classroom was introduced to one of entertainment's greatest stars, Charlie Chaplin. And how did we become aware of this man's works? By watching Modern Times. After watching the movie, I must say that it is one of the FUNNIEST movies I've EVER seen in my life! In fact, I think I've gotten the most enjoyment out of the film than anyone else in the classroom. Why haven't I seen this earlier?<br /><br />Honestly, I don't think there's a lot that I can say that hasn't been said already, but I still highly recommend this movie. Not only is it extremely wonderful and hilarious, but it is also one of the most interesting movies I've ever seen, too. Think about it: Can we students imagine what the 1930s were like, let alone Little Tramp's world? It would be pretty bizarre to visualize ourselves force-fed by a \\"feeding machine\\", as well as TRY to get arrested by doing ridiculous things!<br /><br />You can just watch a few clips of the movie before buying a disc, or you could go and see the other Amazon reviews for further detail about this classic. Either way, there's no doubting that you're in for a great time while it lasts.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I love this game I can not put it down. You<br />gotta have full the full version. So fun and addictive.
B006SMLAMQ|4.0|Wish it was a widget like other weather apps out there.  Moto Atrix.  Make it a widget, and I bet you get plenty of 5 star reviews.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|this is the best yet but once its over its over. they really need to do updates and add new levels or places to go rather than having to buy a new one. this was longer though.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|I like this a lot better than most other alchemy games I have played. But I am giving it one star until this force close bug is fixed.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|Great aside from force close issue. Im sure after they fix it the game will be alot of fun. I prefer this to alchemy. Please Fix!
B004T2QZL8|1.0|So the game caught my interest with time absorbing randomness, until about 3 minutes in and it force closes. Now it literally force closes every time I open it. Useless. If that was fixed it would be alright
0545265355|5.0|This review is not about The Hunger Games storyline, but on the product you are viewing on this page.  This is a beautiful set and arrives in excellent condition, wrapped in plastic to keep all of the book edges free from nicks during shipping.  Though it is not as beautiful as the Millenium Trilogy box set offered on Amazon, this is still a great set, and an amazing price for the three books.  The box is a good hard box, printed and glossed.  The books come with dust jackets and have beautiful embossing on the physical covers and bindings of the books.  The font size is a decent size (this is a young adult series after all), and the three books are comparable in design and size.  A great gift for a lover of the series, or a great way to get the books if you plan on reading all three.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|and I love it. the force close is fixed, I have made 49 elements with no problems so far...except that I'm stuck and cant find anymore matches! I'm going to be addicted to this game...
B006SMLAMQ|5.0|I'm a total neophyte when it comes to using my android tablet/ereader...still have an ancient flip phone, but I love this app. It gives me the info I want for the cities I want.  Hubby and drive around  the USA, so all I have to do is enter the cities on our itinerary to keep up with what is going on. Yes, radar and satellite views would be nice, but I can wait for those. This app satisfies my simple needs quite well. It is really pretty and gives me basic info. I love it!
B001RIY4WE|5.0|This movie is a classic! Arnold at his best! This is in my opinion the best movie he has ever done. Lots of action, great guy movie! I can watch this movie over and over.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|Was ecstatic when I saw this game was free. Started really getting into the game and now it forces close every time I try to pick a second element. It saddens me greatly. Please fix.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|Didnt think that I would enjoy the blu ray version of this movie but it is awesome! Love the high quality video! Great for any Jurassic Park fan!
B004T2QZL8|1.0|It was a really fun game until it kept force closing! As others said when you fix this problem let me know until then uninstall!
B000KKPN5C|5.0|This is one of the best purchases I have made along with my digital SLR. Makes indoor photos 100% better giving your shots more natural light instead of a direct flash. Cant beat this price! Get it, You will not regret it.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|it is a fun game that can gasp me busy for hours on end it just force closes way too much!!!
B007HNFREW|5.0|I watched all ten episodes (over 10 hours) in a twelve hour period.  I could'nt stay away from it.  When one episode ended I had to know what was to follow in the next, it was that good.  The feeling was the same I had waiting for the next Lord of the Rings movie to come out.  Its going to be hard waiting for the second season DVD to be produced.  I hope all 10 episodes will be reproduce on a couple of disks so you don't have to keep wading through the introduction and credits before and after each episode. I'd buy it again if it is, and in Blu-ray the next time.<br /><br />Its taken many years but Sean Bean has grown to be my all time favorite male actor.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I didn't think I would like the game, since I've played alchemy before and not liked it. To my surprise, I started it and lost half an hour without even noticing. The graphics are fun, the quotes are pithy, and playing is easy and engaging. Unfortunately, I did end my game with a crash. I look forward to an update and many more hours of gameplay.
1932735410|4.0|I recently passed my PMP using Rita Mulcahy's, Andy Crowe's, and Kim Heldman's study guides. Using all three was a deliberate study strategy: I chose not to take an instructor-led prep course and study on my own.<br /><br />Rita's was very good, but it did include some extra Rita-isms that I found to be distracting. Also, Rita didn't provide any external resources (web, audio) unless you pay more money.<br />Andy's, in my opinion, was the best stand-alone resource. His writing style and organization were superior to other two volumes. Also, Andy provided a week's worth of video lessons with the book.<br />Kim's, in my opinion, was the least useful of the three. However, Kim did cover some material that the other two missed that did actually appear on my exam. Kim also provided an audio review with the study guide that I found to be useful.<br /><br />Overall, I prefer the multiple text study method. If I had to choose one, I'd go with Andy Crowe.
B006O5Y0SS|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  Born and raised in Paris but living in the US these last 40 years, I could relate to Allen's nostalgia. The opening scenic tour to the music of Sidney Bechet transported me back in time.<br /><br />Woody Allen is not Dostoyevski or Fritz Lang; he has a light touch and doesnt pretend to have a deep message.  And it is not so bad. I loved Bananas and Anny Hall, so I didnt expect a gloomy philosophical lecture.<br /><br />This is a fantasy; one that most of us would like to live: how would it be to go back in time and meet so-and-so? And so we do meet some celebrities, and it is a lot of fun.  Some reviewers said that the actor playing Salvador Dali overdid it; actually, he was way more reserved than his character.<br /><br />Besides leading us through nocturnal time travels, this film does deal with life and death, serious topics if there ever were, but with a light touch, as always.<br /><br />In sum, this film is about fantasy, entertaining, and if there is a message, it is about living.  The cast is excellent, the music is wonderful.  I was a bit disconcerted by the cinematography as the greens seemed artficially bright.  Enjoy it, and you may be surprised that it will stay with you afterwards.
B007M6P01O|1.0|SPOILER<br /><br />I thought this was one of the worst written episodes since a couple of snoozers in Season 1.  There is no fluid continuity to the story line.  The problem is that the downward spiral of Rick happens in one fell swoop and it makes it that much more unbelievable. See, with Shane he played the part of the Heel that was capable of doing good.  You saw how he slowly lost it through the last few episodes.  BUT Rick went from saving Hershel to turning on the whole group.  At no point in his slow devolving did Shane appear this malevolent, but suddenly in one night's span, Rick went from being the Moral Conscience leader of this group to a Totalitarian.<br /><br />I know that many of you can rebutt by pointing to the trauma associated with having to kill your best friend, but understand, others in the groups suffered similarly traumatic losses.  This episode was the equivalent of eating morsels, AND then having your face overstuffed with food.  AND LORI! Wow just three episodes ago she talked about eliminating the threat (Shane).  I understand she had a change of heart last episode, but thru and thru she has stuck with Rick even when he has made the incorrect decision.  Now he tells her that he had no choice but to kill Rick, and she pretty much loses her mind.  Look I'm not asking for perfection.  I'm NOT one to point every single inconsistency.  I enjoyed last episode thoroughly for what it was (mistakes or not)BUT the writers did an absolute shoddy job of wrapping up what has been a fairly enjoyable season.  For other series, I understand the concept of 'moving it along' because of the constant looming threat of cancellation (Happened with V on ABC) BUT for Walking Dead and its immense popularity, I believe that perhaps a couple more episodes would have done the storyline and the introduction to next season justice.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Glad I tried it.  Have it on the KF and it worked great for ten minutes.  Addictive but have to go to work!  If I have any probs will update but seems KF prob was fixed.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|whenever you mix certain elements early on game force closes.  fun game up till then.  using Samsung galaxy nexus. let me know when its fixed.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Still not tired of playing it after 2 months Addictive and awesome.  sometimes I miss just to hear the little guy cry, too cute.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I saw a few complains about the app crashed on KF but I decided to give it a try anyway and it works great.  I love this game.  The introductory is good.  The graphic is great.  The music is just right. It will stay on my KF for awhile.
B0068FYZV6|5.0|Besides saying that The Breakfast Club is one of my favorite movies (and as far as I'm concerned, a rite of passage for teens), I have no other review for the movie itself.<br />So, I will review the seller: item was shipped promptly, was exactly as described, the movie plays great, no issues whatsoever.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I could gush all day about how magneficent I found this book, but I'll just let everyone else do that. I want to say that although a sad face is put on this book for the first few pages, this will make you feel all of the things. I know I felt them.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|I saw this movie on Vudo and decided to purchase a used Blu-ray (that also came with another disc for the computer totaling $18.68 including S&H) from Amazon and although the expedited delivery was anything but (it was slow being delivered), the DVDs are in excellent condition and the movie itself is VERY GOOD. Both leads Chris Hemsworth as Thor, and Tom Hiddleston as Loki, were excellent but it was Tom Hiddleston playing Loki that made the movie for me.  I could not take my eyes off him, his performance was mesmerizing.<br /><br />Both actors were touching, and brought tears to my eyes because the brother's personalities grew in opposite directions.  At first Thor was arrogant and bad, while Loki seemed humble and good, but those roles completely reversed by the finale of the movie and yet I couldn't hate Loki and found myself saying along with Thor, \\"Loki no\\", when Loki did what he did (I don't want to give it away).<br /><br />The CGI and the costumes are great and so are the fighting and action scenes too.<br /><br />Also, some of the best scenes were cut and are in the deleted scenes section of the Blu-ray disc.  Especially the part where Loki is made King (he didn't steal it, it was bestowed upon him according to the line of succession, but by cutting the scene out of the movie it appeared as though he stole the title).<br /><br />I'm looking forward more to Thor II's release (probably in 2013), rather than the Avengers movie that will be released this summer.  Although Thor and Loki are in the Avengers movie I can only imagine it will be the usual Marvel fare, unlike Thor which is the exception.<br /><br />I can highly recommend this movie!
B005HSL626|5.0|ok so i don't get why people are putting bad reviews out there. the game is totally awesome. its my favorite game on my kindle fire:) &lt;3 u fruit ninja!!!!!!!!!!&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!
B005G4TJI4|3.0|I really missed Megan Fox in this movie and think her character's journey was just as important as Shia character's experience with the Transformers.  The new girl was o.k., she got better dialogue then Megan ever did, and she is attractive and seemed to have a better body than Megan (not so skinny), BUT Megan absolutely has a more beautiful face, hands down, and I missed her.<br /><br />The movie itself was decent, I liked all the new evil machines and I was actually entertained.  However, I'm glad I purchased a used copy of the Blu-ray from Amazon, the movie is only worth the used price.
B005K17RU0|3.0|I like this app for how accurate and simple it is but lately it has been cutting out more often and that's frustrating.
B006SMLAMQ|5.0|This app is so cool because it shows pictures of the weather . . . . . . . .
B005RYF5JA|5.0|A few months back my wife (100% Irish) and I caught the show on PBS and decided to attend the St. Patrick's Day Show at the Oakdale Theater in Wallingford Connecticut. What an amazing performance, Máiréad Nesbitt is astounding and the vocals and instrumentals from the entire cast was magnificent. If any of you have a chance to view the show live take advantage of it, you will not be disappointed. I purchased the DVD the very next day and look forward to watching it frequently.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|Very few features compared to many other free app. would have liked it if we could use this as the lock wallpaper our live wallpaper
B004T2QZL8|1.0|After playing for a little bit, the game began force closing on any combination of elements (whether they worked or not). Uninstalled and reinstalled, as well as restarting phone, and the problem reappeared after a time.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|It is a Great game i loved it till the force close started happening. I Hope they can get it fixed.
B005N1OFH0|5.0|Let's face it ' Criminal Minds ' is one of the best fast paced crime dramas ever to show up on prime time TV. Great acting and believable story lines combine to give an hour of great entertaiment. You might even learn something about law enforcement too.  This episode , part 2 of the story line ends in a much more realistic way than some of the others. We get to 'get into the mind' of the killer, and with this knowlege  he becomes so much more that what we think he is in part one. Although he has committed terrible acts of violence to people, including dismemberment and murder,we are shown that he is also a victim of terrible circumstances. As  we get a glimpse of the \\"WHY\\"  of his actions and not just the \\"HOW, we can see that what he had to endure as a child helped to set him on his path ,of becoming a sociopath. Maybe by becoming more aware of our own neighbors, and their circumstances we might all be able to help improve our society as a whole. As the  show points out sometimes all people need is someone to listen and try to help and we could avert a terrible tragedy.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|It is an ok app. I mean, it's not totally suckish. It requires no skill whatsoever, and it's a bit dull. I think it isn't worth anything. play for a week or so and uninstall. Tada.<br />  S. C. F.
B0024RID60|3.0|I have never listened to this album before, I have listened to some songs in the live performances. Considering a user's review I looked for the 1996's release because it's supposed to have better sound, but I've made a mistake when I made my purchase and now I've got this one.  It sounds too \\"metalic\\", not enought bass and lack of punch in the drums. So I have another 1996 copy just coming and I hope I coud then listen to the good mix.<br /><br />I can't understand how they keep on going with the same mistake again and again: please mates, if you are remixing something do it to get better sound (remove noises and undesired hisses, improve some frecuency ranges and that stuff)but not everything is worth. When we look for a remixed album we expect just that.<br /><br />I heard this album in my Ipod, at the best quality, and I use Sennheiser PX100 headphones that deliver amazing sound quality and I can't hear the bass in the two first songs, and in the other the drums are too weak. I'll give another chance in my audio set but I don't expet too much. The Sennheiser PX100 are working realy good but if music has a poor mix or the glass-room personnel are not good enough at their job, well then you can't expect a miracle.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Words cannot even describe how much I love this book.  I just could not put it down.  I love how Collins is able to explain the character even if they were only in a paragraph.  Beautiful Rue.  I have never cried so hard over a death of a character.  And Katniss.  She is so strong, stubborn, beautiful, athletic, and brave.  I wish I could be more like her.  And then there is Peeta.  I love him! Hes sweet, brave, kind, and loyal.  Overall, Collins did an AMAZING job!!!
B004T2QZL8|4.0|it would always force close but the game was pretty fun and I wish joybits could fix this :). It kinda ruined the game since I cant play any more and I even tried erasing the app and installing it again but it did not work
B000065U1N|5.0|This is a really good movie. It has some of favorite actors (such as orlando bloom and ewan mcgregor). it is packed with excitement, tension, and heart stopping moments. it is worth seeing, unless u cant handle blood :)
B004T2QZL8|1.0|On LG Revolution, worked fine for like an hour but once i had like 50 ingredients it crashed every time i tried to do a combination. When it did work it was moderately fun though.
B0077ZNCE2|2.0|This one was not nearly as good or innocent as the others. Kind of a dark dtheme and way too much sexual content for kids.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|force close! !!!!!!!!<br />fix the force close please! !!!!!!!<br />fix it fix it fix it<br />great game but it force closes!
B003Y5H5HY|4.0|After watching the original Swedish version I wanted to see how this one hold up. Is a great movie and worth watching if you're a fan of the genre or the original versions.<br /><br />The only thing I just can't stand is the Ultra Violet integration. Is just annoying and a pain to use or even make an account (or 2 or 3 depending on what studio implements it). Besides that, everything is great. I sort of freaked out when I opened the package and I saw the dvd version of it with the sony DVD-R logo and an R rating for \\"Brutal Violent content\\"  and written in permanent marker the title of the movie instead of looking the same as the others. Definitely gave me a scare thinking there must be something wrong, but it worked fine. Is just unusual to see and seems weird. I think overall is a superb movie that is highly enjoyable. Rooney Mara definitely embodied her character. Daniel Craig was good but she was great. David Fincher did a great job directing.<br /><br />Now I'll just have to get the book trilogy and get lost in its pages.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Doodle God is a wonderful fun game that has a nearly endless combinations! Its worth the money it costs. ignore the other reviews saying it closes constantly, the update fixed it COMPLETELY! this is one of the best apps ever!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have a softspot for solitaire because years ago my grandfather taught me how to play with a deck of cards. And now since he' s been gone nearly ten years, playing solitaire makes me feel connected with him still. great game, really enjoyable!
B001PB3RU8|5.0|Good album!!! Best played really loud. cant wait to hear her new one. Pretty cool chick at the helm of that rockin band!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This app used to force close but after the most recent update it's been incredibly smooth and stable. Other then that it's a lot of fun and a lot like little alchemist.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|43 before force close, what's your highest score. please let us know when you fix this app, replay value would be moderate, time invested would be well spent.
B006SMLAMQ|2.0|If Weather+ had widget options that appeared as equally nice as the layouts it offers as-is, I would find it very useful.<br /><br />As it is, no widget, there are better options that are free, faster and consume less memory.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|As has been said in many reviews of this game, it is a lot of fun but frustrating because of force closing issues. I really like this style of game but as soon as I really started to get going on it, it continually force closes. I also had a lot of trouble getting it to install in the first place. I am hoping for an update/fix soon because I would very much like to continue playing.<br /><br />If you like this kind of element combining/creation game I would recommend Alchemy as a substitute. Alchemy is very similar and the free version is full and completely playable. It is only missing a few features, that the paid version has, that are in no way essential for playing the game in its entirety. I have never had any problems with Alchemy either in the install or functioning of the game.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Simply put, this final book was a fantastic end to the Trilogy.<br /><br />Couldn't have asked for a more satisfying closure to this series.<br /><br />The only downside is the, saga is over.
B00001ZWTT|4.0|Today's movie was \\"Wild Wild West\\" starring Will Smith and Kevin Kline. Well, it's somewhat hard to even consider this oddity a movie. If someone asked me what the plot was all about, for example, I'd be hard pressed to give a coherent answer. The main character's name is West and it takes place in the western U. S., more or less, in about the mid-1800s. Rather than consider it a story, I'd have to regard it as about 90 minutes of assorted absurdities. Some are humorous. Following the story, if there is one, is nearly impossible, but if you want to watch it for odd jokes, strange lines, visual puns and widely assorted gadgetry, it's actually  amusing. enjoyable and entertaining. The gadgets, in particular, are rather clever and some of them are hilariously funny. How Hollywood ever puts these things together are beyond my understanding. And it obviously had to have major funding. The acting wasn't bad if you can get by with the absurdity. The filming and soundtrack are excellent. The story? Well, it's funny too, but in a moronic way. I'd say watch it if you have a taste for really odd comedies or if you're a gadget lover. Otherwise, you're probably going to find it a waste of time.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B0053VKP8S|2.0|Product did not work for me on my system...when I hooked it up, it just made a clicking sound. I tried rerouting, undoing this & that, it merely wouldn't work! So I sent it back & I'm waiting for a refund.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Oh, this is just an absolutely awful book. The plot (what little there is) is unbelievably boring, the characters are universally unsympathetic and the sex (for which the book is apparently famous) is more boring than the plot. Add to all of that the fact that these 20-something Washingtonians all speak with the vocabulary of a middle-aged British housewife, and you have the perfect recipe for a few tragically wasted hours at the Kindle. I am told that this book is \\"fan fiction\\" of the Twilight series, and certainly the only good thing it has done for me is convince me to steer clear of those books.  I don't mind paying the ten bucks for the book, since I did read it, but I really wish I had those hours back. I could have done something more productive with that time- like watching grass grow.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I don't have any problems with this game. this game is awesome, similar to alchemy and is a good time killer when sitting at the DMV.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|You can't even play this after a while. Every failed attempt at creating an element after you have about thirty makes the game force quit.  Don't even waste your time downloading. Nice game, but it becomes useless.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|would have gone 5 stars.  I had a lot of fun with this until force close issue.  didn't read reviews first since it was the free app of the day, so didn't have a warning.  I'd have thought amazon would actually check that an app works before offering it as a &quot;front page&quot; app.  Played on Kindle fire btw.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|ummm this was a great game but I got to 28 elements and it just stooped working. hope it gets fixed soon
B004T2QZL8|4.0|It's good for wasting time on my kindle. I'm glad it was free because I would be disappointed if I paid for it.
1932100660|1.0|It's unfortunate for the cause of vegetarians and vegans that they rally behind this book. Unfortunately Dr. Campbell lost tremendous clout when he broke all the rules he explicitly lays out at the beginning of this book. The China Study is know in the epi field as being rife with causal effects and assumptions that aren't represented by the very data he gives. More unfortunate is that in order to feed a vegan rhetoric, rather than understand this complete abandonment of scientific principal, they lodge themselves into its unfounded conclusions.<br />Dr. Campbell has done some excellent work in the nutritional sciences and vegetarianism has tremendous merits, but none of them are to be found in this book.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|just like alchemy but it force closes after 45min and then each time you open the game and choose a bad combination of elements<br />did the developer even test this game at all?
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Problem fixed great game<br />Same problem. 28 elements and force close. Hope you fix this soon so you can get 5 stars.<br />In your comments you asked for 5 stars to keep the updates coming. I think if you update it you will get the 5 stars coming.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|This app is so fun. The only flaw is that you can't stop the game or like... close the restaurant.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|this is a great game.you all should do THIS!<br />Nothing is wrong with this game.idk why you guys think that.you all should play it. like they say we all have our op.I gave this game a 5.Like I said you all would play it same day.this is a great game.I like the part were you can make other thing.
B0072X2O66|5.0|This album kicks some serious butt.  The people writing the bad reviews wanted some kind of progressive rock album from this.  I'm glad to say that its just good old bluesy groove metal from some very talented musicians.  The production is good and the guitar playing is outstanding.
B006SMLAMQ|4.0|Dont typically review but many people are complaining about no widgets.  There are absolutely widgets and they are very nice on my transformer running ICS. All reviewers saying there are no Widgets are mistaken.  This app isn't perfect so 4 stars.  Worth the download on a tablet as it is fairly large.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|really who wants to own a resturaunt, except for sponge bob and my fat friend ,but besides the fact wat is it about this game maker and jobs that aren't sucsessfull
B005T87QCI|1.0|do not buy this game cause I wasted 2 bucks on this junk because my 7 year old wont stop complaining how hard and stupid this game is. not recommended.
B004I744AS|5.0|Easy to use, and most importantly, accurate!<br />I would love to have this on my desktop too!  Now, maybe I'll finally be able to figure out what some of the stuff my Wife says to me means!
B004T2QZL8|2.0|The app was running fine on my Kindle Fire, but once I got to 12 groups, and 30+ elements, it started to crash and close unexpectedly with any new combos that I tried to make. What a shame, as the game seems like it will be fun. I hope this can be fixed.
B0057VDGNK|4.0|If you're tired of the radio and just want to clear your mind on the road,<br />buy this.<br />However after seening the movie I can help but see the person<br />who died during each song.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|This game is amazing now that they have fixed the force close issue. It is repetitive but it's fun when you finally find an element you were missing.
B004LWZW7O|5.0|It's a well produced movie, a really great story and thought-provoking drama. And ..it's sci-fi. Ahhh, yes wash over me sciii-fiii..<br /><br />Maybe people were missing their normal, movie-product-placement ads for Budweiser and Dunkin Donuts? (Keeps America Going)<br /><br />These reviewers are killing me. This was a good movie, maybe not Lord of the Rings but jeez. Watching, actually attempting to watch Reel Steel, I was reminded how awful 9 out of 10 movies are these days.<br /><br />I love movies and have seen most of them (it's true) and this is a good movie, well deserving of four out of five stars. I'm giving it five because I enjoyed the story, I liked JT, and generally was happier for the entertainment. I can't say the same for most television or movie these days, it's like quality got stranded in the 80's. And now that Walking Dead season 2 is over, I'm searching for things to watch. Killer Elite was also a great recent flick, well made. Just like In Time.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|I couldn't even figure it out on the fire it wouldn't go to the location that I put in and it wasn't as good as other ones
B0068AWQQ2|3.0|I'm not trying to diss the actresses here (I've liked Toni Collete when she's playing basically the same role in several other movies, and the girlfriend has some good scenes), but everyone who's seen a horror film will know the horrible stereotypes that these women fall into. They are useless. Completely useless. Horror isn't the only genre to have its little stereotypes, but it's certainly the one that has the hardest time rising above them. I'm not sure why this should be the case except inasmuch as people have to act extremely irrationally to set up the most frightening scenes. But horror movie females have the worst time. They are always shrill and emotional, they never listen to the main character, and they generally start crying and breaking down in the most obnoxious ways at the worst possible moments. It's a stupid and sexist stereotype, and worse it's extremely annoying. They are obviously there only as a crutch for the main character so that the screenwriters can put him in situations which any sane man would avoid.<br /><br />This film features a particularly egregious example of that. No, I don't blame the women for not believing the lead initially. He sounds crazy and he knows it. But once they are attacked by the vampire they get even worse. He just tried to blow their house up, then he hurled a bike at their car, yet the mother can't think to drive more than twenty miles per hour down a highway in the middle of the desert. When she realizes they're being chased she continues at the same speed and keeps telling her son that the man chasing them can't be a vampire. It doesn't matter woman! There's a crazy man trying to kill you! Whether he's a vampire or not is irrelevant. When someone wants you dead you get away fast. Simple. You certainly don't:<br />A. Drive slowly and let him pass you.<br />B. Just sit there when he blocks the road in front of you.<br />C. Faint.<br />She does all of these and it's beyond infuriating. I understand that you need to set up some sort of set-piece for the vampire's sheer awesomeness, but why can't you do it in a way that doesn't make everyone involved look like they're dumber than a bag of bricks. Nobody could possibly be that stupid, so kindly present us with some characters we can actually emphasize with. The girlfriend is significantly better (as well as actually having a character) but she then manages to get separated from her boyfriend in the middle of a rave. I get that they needed to get separated so he could rescue her, but again: believability. You shouldn't be getting abducted in the middle of a crowd and have nobody notice. I also doubt that a teenager can go into a store and buy a crossbow, then just walk down the street with it and have noone notice. When watching a vampire movie I don't want the vampire to be the most rational person there. It's not like there aren't any good women in horror movies. Ripley from Alien is one of the best and she's extremely rational. But horror films keep sticking with mindless bimbos and it has gotten really old.<br /><br />This is especially unfortunate because the guys in this are great. Colin Farrel makes a great vampire, and David Tennant gets to play a stagey magician. The two younger actors are Anton Yelchin (Checkov) and Christopher Mintz-Plasse (McLovin'). I've liked Yelchin ever since he was a kid, and Mintz-Plasse has impressed me by playing just about every variation on nerd in existence. That's not me being sarcastic, most actors who play nerdy kids have only one way of presenting it and that's why they don't last. All of these actors are good, but they can't rescue it from the stupidity that ensues whenever one of the women is onscreen. Yelchin's character does some stupid things, but he does some smart things too and his final battle is actually clever enough for me to forgive a lot. But it doesn't make up for the rest of the film. The women in this film are dumb, which isn't the fault of the actresses but the writers.Some stereotypes really need to die, because they are quite capable of ruining what looked like a promising movie.<br /><br />So basically the scorecard is this:<br />Good: Male leads, vampire effects, overall plot, character development.<br />Bad: Female leads, plot details, believability.Some stereotypes really need to die, because they are quite capable of ruining what looked like a promising movie.<br /><br />So basically the scorecard is this:<br />Good: Male leads, vampire effects, overall plot, character development.<br />Bad: Female leads, plot details, believability.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this is an amazingly well written book!It is by far one of my absoulute favorites. Suzanne Collins wrote three amazing books.Will there be another?
B004T2QZL8|1.0|Despite the reviews I thought I'd give this game a try. Sadly the force closes happen so often it makes the game virtually unplayable.<br /><br />Even if the force closes weren't an issue I think I would have a hard time enjoying this because of one key feature.  My memory isn't the greatest so I find myself not remembering which combos I had already made. With that said, this app lets you make the same combo  over and over again, unlike Alchemy where you could turn that feature off.<br /><br />Download at your own risk...not worth the time in my opinion...unless things get fixed.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|I've played alchemy before but this game is a lot better set up and the animations are cool. Now it just started force closing on me as well. If it were a free version, fine. But since this is the paid version that you would usually shell out 3 bucks for the crashes should NOT be happening, its unacceptable that a company allows itself this. Fix, and there will be waaay more buys and downloads...guaranteed.
0670022950|5.0|The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined by Steven Pinker<br /><br />\\"The Better Angels of Our Nature\\" is the reference quality book that that successfully and thoroughly posits the reasons why violence has declined over time. In this massive and persuasive book, Steven Pinker Professor of Psychology at Harvard University, follows the facts wherever they may go and provides compelling arguments backed by sound science. What makes this book great is the quality of the material presented and the absorbing topic being pursued. Pinker succinctly establishes the premises and systematically goes after them with scientific diligence. This 832-page book is composed of the following ten chapters: 1. A Foreign Country, The Pacification Process, 3. The Civilizing Process, 4. The Humanitarian Revolution, 5. The Long Peace, 6. The New Peace, 7. The Rights Revolutions, 8. Inner Demons, 9. Better Angels and 10. On Angels' Wings.<br /><br />Positives:<br />1. Rigorously researched book in the hands of a master.<br />2. Violence is a fascinating topic. Pinker covers this topic from virtually every angle and I mean from every angle. This is a meticulous book, I can't stress this enough.<br />3. Accessible prose.<br />4. Great use of charts and illustrations. Very few books provide as many charts as this book. Chart after chart that effectively conveys what he has put so well into words.<br />5. This book posits the basic premise with gusto, \\"violence has declined over long stretches of time, and today we may be living in the most peaceable era in our species' existence\\". I have not read a book that has made a more compelling case.<br />6. Great quotes, \\"Across time and space, the more peaceable societies also tend to be richer, healthier, better educated, better governed, more respectful of their women, and more likely to engage in trade\\".<br />7. In a nutshell, \\"The Better Angels of Our Nature is a tale of six trends, five inner demons, four better angels, and five historical forces\\".<br />8. The Six Major Trends that make up our species' retreat from violence: 1. The Pacification Process (the transition from the anarchy of the hunting, gathering, and horticultural societies); 2. The Civilizing Process (the consolidation of a patchwork of feudal territories into large kingdoms); 3. The Humanitarian Revolution (the first organized movement to abolish socially sanctioned forms of violence like despotism, slavery, dueling, judicial torture, superstitious killing, etc...; 4. The Long Peace (since World War II the great powers have stopped waging war on one another); 5. The New Peace (since the end of the Cold War in 1989, organized conflicts of all kinds, have declined; The Rights Revolutions (since the Universal Declaration Human Rights in 1948, has seen a growing revulsion against aggression on smaller scales).<br />9. The Five Demons: 1. Predatory or instrumental violence, 2. Dominance, 3. Revenge, 4. Sadism, and 5. Ideology.<br />10. The Four Better Angels: 1. Empathy, 2. Self-control, 3. The Moral Sense, and 4. The faculty of Reason.<br />11. Five Historical Forces: 1. The Leviathan, 2. Commerce, 3. Feminization, 4. Cosmopolitanism, and 5. The Escalator of Reason.<br />12. The Bible as one long celebration of violence. Right off the bat Pinker puts the Bible in perspective.<br />13. The book is full of amusing historical anecdotes of course involving violence. \\"Andrew Jackson, immortalized on the twenty-dollar bill, carried bullets from so many duels that he claimed to 'rattle like a bag of marbles' when he walked\\".<br />14. Hobbes and his logic of violence. The three principle causes of quarrel: 1. Competition, Diffidence, and 3. Glory. And the Hobbesian trap.<br />15. What spearheaded the European decline of violence.<br />16. Pinker will overwhelm you with numbers and how those numbers make sense. As an engineer, I'm impressed.<br />17. The author starts many great topics with a series of questions and then proceeds to goto work.<br />18. Many social issues of interest are covered with a luxury of details.<br />19. The fascinating macabre world of the instruments of torture.<br />20. Witchcraft as one of the most common motives for revenge. So many horrible stories.<br />21. The evil that is slavery.<br />22. The impact of Gutenberg's invention of the printing press.<br />23. What morality truly is...great stuff.<br />24. The worst atrocities of all time. I'm mesmerized.<br />25. What is the best anti-war film of all time? Find out.<br />26. Divisive ideologies.<br />27. How Marxist eschatology actually mimicked Christian doctrine.<br />28. Terrorism a peculiar category of violence. 9/11 attacks and then some. Putting it all in perspective.<br />29. Climate change and violence?<br />30. The oppression of women. Feminism. \\"In fact, the men of the early 1990s had attitudes that were more feminist than those of the women in the 1970s\\".<br />31. Religious intolerance.<br />32. Sexual orientation.<br />33. Violence against animals.<br />34. How we are wired for violence. The human brain.<br />35. Most heinous form of human depravity. Sadism.<br />36. Human genetics and the link to violence? Nature versus nurture.<br />37. The book ends with optimism or gratitude.<br />38. Links worked great!<br /><br />Negatives:<br />1. The book may overwhelm you. There is so much here (over 800 pages) so it will require an investment of time.<br />2. The author has progressive views (for the sake of honesty so do I) and may rub the conservative voices the wrong way.<br />3. A couple of editing issues...minor issues considering how massive this book is.<br />4. I'm an atheist but even I can find some positive things to say about some religious practices.<br />5. Having to buy multiple copies of this book, I rented it but I will purchase it for reference sake!<br /><br />In summary, this is a fascinating, massive book about the decline of violence in history. Steven Pinker has written an encyclopedic, enlightening, and ambitious book that covers practically every topic related to violence. This is a book that I will reference for the rest of my life. It's that thorough and complete. However, this massive book will overwhelm you at times. There is so much in this book that at times it can be repetitive and will test your patience to read it all. All that being said, this book is a worthwhile read. It will reward you with enlightenment on such an important topic.

B006OOHYIC|5.0|I love this game and the original Quell. Both are fun, challenging and relaxing. Its fun figuring out how to complete each level in the perfect amount of moves! I highly recommend this game for anyone who enjoys puzzles!
B007M6P01O|5.0|No Spoilers here, so if you haven't watched S2 no worries.  Yes this season had it's slow points, but i never for 1 second lost interest.  It's twice as long as season one, so of course the action will be drawn out.  Either way, this finale was EPIC!!  Wow, you need to watch this if you havent!  My only sadness is that i now have to wait until fall for season 3.  It can't come soon enough!  I am highly anticipating it!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|ranging from casual reading to intensive study, this app is capable of meeting your scriptural needs in a variety of translations and interprative versions.
B00005N6KG|5.0|If you have problems using earphones cause it iritates your ear after awhile or your ears sweat if you use the muff ear set, then this is the product for you. Fits snuggly in your ear without any bit of iritation. Will buy ten more of these. Those who did not get will regret it should Sony decided to stop production.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|Update came down for me and the game force closed after 50  elements please fix otherwise great game!! Pleas update it again it needs it on HTC Thunderbolt

B004T2QZL8|1.0|I love this game. It was great online and I was excited to get it on my phone. I reached 28 elements and when I tried to create another one it will force close. I'm using a Droid 3 and it is up to date on all the software. please fix the issue so I can give 5 stars.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is my favorite of the series.  It is full of suspense and drama and definitely leads in different places some unexpected.  I found myself sobbing at parts and laughing at others.  Fifty Shades Darker is my favorite of the 3 books!
B004UUKDNA|5.0|Foster The People literally came out of nowhere the past year and just took the world by storm. While they were not an overnight sensation, they most definitely became popular pretty damn quick. Mark Foster whom is the bands leader, created this group a good 2 years ago and has ever since been trying to make it as an aspiring musician. In a music world where everything from pop to hip hop to even some rock music has the same electronic-dub step foundation nowadays, this type of music (while not new) is refreshing to hear again on the radio. Foster The People reminds me of bands such as MGMT/Empire of The Sun, although not totally out there,  Foster has a more mainstream pop sound added to the indie pop rock music genre. This album was great from start to finish with only a few blemishes here and there, mostly for instances of repetition in sound, but otherwise this album was fun and catchy the whole way through.<br /><br />1) Helena Beat - My personal favorite and great start to the album. This album is full of catchy hooks and great synthesizers mixed with the rock sound, and I just love the energy particulary in this song the most. 10/10<br /><br />2) Pumped Up Kicks - If you don't know this song by now, then you must be living under a rock. Despite the fact that this song was overplayed on the radio, it is a great song. It is amazing great how minimal instrumentation is in this song and yet still sounds incredibly catchy for anyone to bob their head too. The subject matter is pretty twisted but nothing shock value worthy. 10/10<br /><br />3) Call it What You Want - this song has a very distinct sound that I would expect from MGMT, and Mark Fosters voice just keeps getting higher with every preceding song. Yet another catchy song with a great hook. 10/10<br /><br />4) Don't Stop (Color on the Walls) - has a different tempo compared to the first 3 songs, but all the more sweeter. This song features a more deeper sound Foster which is a nice change from the falsetto like vocals. Catchy and fun is the premise of this album and this one is no different. 10/10<br /><br />5) Waste -  I love the production on this song probably the most. It has great synthesizers and catchy drum snares. the only gripe I have with this song is that it has a similar sound to \\"Pumped Up Kicks\\" 9/10<br /><br />6)I Would Do Anything For You - We have now reached the halfway point and this is where the song starts to slow down a bit. This song is more mellow and less catchy compared to the other songs which is not a bad thing. I love the emotional lyrics in this song. It's a great personal drawn from Mark Fosters personal experiences which transfers into his songwriting ability very well. 10/10<br /><br />7) Houdini - coming back to there catchy style, this song however lacks luster in the songs hook, it is not as catchy as the previous songs but it is still a very good song. The production on this song is the BEST on the entire album in my opinion. Great piano and great synths again. 9/10<br /><br />8) Life on the Nickel - this was the first time i felt overwhelmed with the albums sound. Although this song is not as different from the rest of the album, I just did not connect with this song as well as the other ones. This time the electronic sounds were not in favor to the song. 7/10<br /><br />9) Miss You - I did not enjoy this song as much I should've. This was the only song that just did not catch my attenion very well. Even with multiple plays i just can't find myself to like this ong very much. It is not a bad song, just my least favorite. 6/10<br /><br />10) Warrant - We have come to the end of the album and it was great, this song was fitted perfectly at the end of the album, I could not imagaine any of the other tracks closing this album better than this track. Warrant starts off with mysterious chanting vocals and slowly proceeds to pick up pace about a minute in the song. Great production and fun rebellious lyrics from Foster. This was a greatalbum and I am looking forward to their second LP. 10/10album and I am looking forward to their second LP. 10/10
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This series is the best series out there. It is a very easy and quick read.  I was able to read all 3 books in less than a week.  The sad part is that after the third book there is no more.  I find myself really wanting more from the series!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|The app is currently crashing constantly on both my kindle fire and Atrix 4g. I had pondered purchasing doodle devil, but not till this app is fixed.<br /><br />Updated:<br /><br />They managed to get it sorted out.  I hope in the future the app of the day is tested on the Kindle Fire before releasing it to the masses..

B0007PAMR4|4.0|This Movie is one of my favourites and I am very glad to have found here on Amazon as it is not easy to get a hold of. I have notice that on both the theatrical version and the extended version of this DVD it did have some damaged areas that my computer had to skip (frustrating). I am pleased with my purchase overall.
B007M6P01O|5.0|What I love about this episode is that it prepares you for what is to come in season three. What I don't like is Lori's character. She is a you know what. I can't stand how throughout the season she manipulated Rick and Shane. Then have the nerve to be angry when Rick told her what he did. She didn't even want him to touch her she was so disgusted. I am like, seriously? I think Rick handled things the best way he could and was forced to do what he did to Shane. While the group sat around and did nothing he handled all of the difficult decisions. Now they act like they don't want to trust Rick. That is why I am glad he said what he said at the end of this season. Rick followed by Daryl and Andrea are the coolest characters because they have what it takes to survive. I hope in season three that if they decide to ax more characters, the one that should go is Lori. What could have been the best scene ever was if she was bitten by Shane. Both are manipulators.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|Fun until force closes every time you try to combine something. gave up on it. wouldve been neat if it worked.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I've been an avid reader since I was 6yrs old. I've read ALOT of books in the past 60 years. As you may guess, I've read alot of junk (my opinion)between really great reads (my opinion)! Kinda like you have to kiss alot of frogs before you find a prince (wore out my kisser and still no prince)! But I digress..this series (my opinion) and I'm only on book 2, is really a great read. I'm dreading the day I finish all 3! To me, it ranks right up there with the Harry Potter, Twilight, Left Behind and Outlander series! Do we see a pattern here? It's interesting to me that many of these books had teenagers as their target audience. No matter, I am enjoying every page so much I couldn't even wait until I was finished to add my stars to the pile! Wonderful series!
0385534639|4.0|I enjoyed this book a great deal. The idea behind it was immensely creative and the imagery was fantastic. The story pulled me in from the very beginning and held me most of the way through. The author lost me a little towards the end, however; I feel like the plot took a turn towards contrived in the last hundred pages or so. I also wasn't a huge fan of the way the book jumped back and forth between many different time periods, making it hard to keep track of the order in which events occurred. Still, \\"The Night Circus\\" was a great read, and I would recommend it to anyone looking to add a bit of whimsy to their world.
B005NKGEP2|4.0|Chris Pavone has written an engaging debut espionage novel and truly nails the expat experience. Having lived overeas for years, I swear Chris was living in my back pocket as his characters moved across Europe. I am an avid reader and thoroughly enjoyed this story from beginning to end. He not only captures the imagination but also the heart with his take on marriage caught in unusual circumstances. I recommend this book highly and expect an amazing future from this talented author.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|All this game dies is force close. Have tried everything I can think of to make it work. Uninstalling. EVO 3D.
B007CGLRWA|4.0|At first the movie was a little slow so it took me two days to finish it, but after viewing it once I think I am going to view it again.<br />This movie has so many meanings behind it.<br />To the kids who don't care about school and think like these kids to the people who are out of school looking back at their school years.<br />  I'm starting to think about sending some flowers to my old schools or maybe anonymously donating some school supplies as a way of saying thank you for putting up with me(I was the quiet kid)
B000YMJA7I|5.0|Never before and never since has a hard rock band put forth such a clean sound. Everything has its place. Nothing is superfluous or there just for the sake of being there. Guns N' Roses are truly masters at their craft. For those who don't know them well or are getting to known them again, here they are at their very best.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|I would like the game a lot more if I could actually play it without the game crashing all the time. ridiculous
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is great love it its so fun!!!!!&iexcl;&iexcl;!!!!!&iexcl;!&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! my fab game is the sushi one fun I also like the car one to really fun u should get it
B004T2QZL8|2.0|It's a fun game. but now that I have 11 elemrents and 50 or so things unlocked it force closes on every attempt on kindle fire
B004T2QZL8|2.0|this game is actually really fun. I love it. but it keeps crashing now that I got to the milk and meat. I cant combine any or it'll force close
B007M6P01O|5.0|I am definitely a fan of character progression but it was about time this show got some action. Searching for Sophia and a stale love triangle pretty much dragged this season down. Of all the moral situations a zombie apocalypse can explore, why choose the most used plot line on TV ever? In any case, I like where the show seems to be going now. I don't care what anyone says, Rick is a good leader when taking everything into account. Nobody else has had the courage to stand up and lead their little posse, and yes, that includes Shane. Shane was ruled by selfish tendencies, Rick makes calls based on what he thinks will be best for the whole group. Rick would have killed Shane a long time ago if this weren't true. Most criticisms I hear for Rick's leadership are based on hindsight, which Rick doesn't have the luxury of using while making his decisions. The fact that Rick is still as good as  he is says a lot about his character.<br /><br />I'm liking how the other characters are developing as well with a few exceptions. I don't get how Lori is so stupid. One moment she's telling Rick that Shane is unsafe (a few episodes back), next she's disgusted with him for making one of the toughest calls he's ever had to make. What a dumb broad! And Carl is just as useless! All he does is get people killed or put them in more danger than they're already in and then flex some pretty crappy acting skills on top of it.<br /><br />In the Walking Dead world, living is based on moment to moment, there is very little time to make decisions that will have any lasting impact. Man has been brought back to the Middle Ages (minus a few guns and cars) and it's been great watching how normal people deal with it. I can't wait for season 3!
B006SMLAMQ|2.0|very pretty but would be much better if it had a widget to put it on the homescreen. very nice looking.
0143039601|5.0|The Dharma Bums was published in 1958, a year after Kerouac's more famous novel, On the Road. I read them both in the 1960's and remember his free-flowing writing style and his general enthusiasm but with On the Road I couldn't understand what all the fuss was about. It may have been a seminal work but being original doesn't necessarily mean it is engaging. Lacking confidence, I assumed it was my fault. I read it again in the mid 1980's and, with confidence, understood less \\"what all the fuss was about.\\" I recalled that I had liked The Dharma Bums better--way back then--but I couldn't remember why. So after forty some years, I revisited it.<br /><br />The Dharma Bums is less about the Beat generation (as in On the Road) and more about a couple young men, Ray and Japhy, in search of Truth through Zen Buddhism. This was based on the real-life Kerouac and pal poet Gary Snyder, who apparently had a large influence on Kerouac's Buddhist journey. There is a lot more praying, meditation, and celibacy going on here than wild living, although Ray did like his port wine. I found Kerouac's zest for life innocent and life affirming, his striving for understanding of the world similar to other men's striving. He was thirty-six at the time but he sounded younger and wiser.<br /><br />The essence of the book is told in one paragraph, well into the book: \\"[S]ee the whole thing is a world of rucksack wanderers, Dharma Bums refusing to subscribe to the general demand that they consume production and therefore have to work for the privilege of consuming all that crap they didn't really want anyway such as refrigerators, TV sets, cars, at least new fancy cars, certain hair oils and deodorants and general junk you finally always see a week later in the garbage anyway, all of them imprisoned in a system of work, produce, consume, work, produce, consume, I see a vision of a great rucksack revolution thousands or even millions of young Americans wandering around with rucksacks, going up to mountains to pray, making children laugh and old men glad, making young girls happy and old girls happier, all of `em Zen Lunatics who go about writing poems that happen to appear in their heads for no reason and also being kind and also by strange unexpected acts keep giving visions of eternal freedom to everybody and to all living creatures....\\" One might accuse Kerouac of being a prophet back in 1958; or lacking a divine source, at least a soothsayer, predicting the Hippy movement and \\"flower children.\\"<br /><br />I enjoyed the great hike into the Sierras, the descriptions of Marin County, the name dropping of locations--North Beach, Oakland and Berkeley--the trips for skid row coffee, shopping at Goodwill and the Salvation Army, hopping trains, hitchhiking home to North Carolina for Christmas, living lean in comfortable shacks, and the summer of self-discovery on fire watch at Desolation Peak in Washington. I particularly liked reading the bit about the cheap bus ride from smoggy LA to Riverside, with its fresh clean air! \\"I was exulted to see a beautiful dry river bottom with white sand and just a trickle river in the middle as we rolled over the bridge into Riverside.\\" He camped among the thickets, \\"a kind of bamboo,\\" on the river bottom in a nice open spot \\"except for the roar of trucks on the river bridge.\\" In the 1960's, this had no meaning to me. But I now know the bridge because I lived in Riverside, CA for twenty-five years. It's on Mission Inn Blvd. and it's the same place where the homeless camp today.<br /><br />Kerouac floats between sadness, \\"Are we fallen angels who didn't want to believe that nothing is nothing and so were born to lose our loved ones and dear friends one by one and finally our own life, to see it proved?\\"--to moments of humorous joy--\\"But let the mind beware, that though the flesh be bugged, the circumstances of existence are pretty glorious.\\"<br /><br />I now know why I liked this book all those years ago. I read it at a time when being a hobo was an option, when riding a freight train was a considered choice, when the song lyric \\"I've got plenty of nothin and nothin's plenty for me,\\" from Porgy and Bess, held an attraction. I had a romanticized notion that happiness was to be found in a vow of poverty and adventurous exploration, mixing my Jack London, Hemmingway and Robert Rurak with the Beat writers. My \\"Desolation Peak\\" experience was in 1963, a summer at 9000 feet, in Fish Lake Utah, spending my nights in my sleeping bag on a cot in a rustic old lodge, my days doing the work of common men, my free time fishing, exploring, messing with the Mormon girls, and killing jackrabbits. At the end of the summer, I hitchhiked to LA with a change of underwear plus four cans of Coors beer rolled up in my sleeping bag then hitched all the back to Ohio arriving two days before the beginning of my senior year in college. It was the most difficult semester of my prosaic college life. I didn't want to be there. I wanted to climb mountains, sail the oceans, see the world, witness nature at its wildest, experience the freedom of unlimited options. A sense of responsibility and a cute cheerleader helped me change my mind--the cheerleader more than the sense of responsibility. (I had also concluded that I liked girls who shaved their legs and smelled good. One might suggest that this was a sign of intelligence. I know it had nothing to do with intelligence).<br /><br />Accusing Kerouac of naivety would be a valid criticism of his thinking. The world wasn't (and isn't) ready to \\"wake up\\" as he suggests, but I admire his optimism: \\"You and I ain't out to bust anybody's skull, or cut someone's throat in an economic way, we've dedicated ourselves to prayer for all sentient beings and when we're strong enough we'll really be able to do it, too, like the old saints. Who knows, the world might wake up and burst out into a beautiful flower of Dharma everywhere.\\" I recently read a definition of the pursuit of happiness from Charles Colson. (What? You've got to be kidding! Chuck Colson and Jack Kerouac in the same paragraph?) Colson said it was \\"the freedom to make our best efforts toward a virtuous life.\\" Kerouac may have been misguided, self-destructive and a sleazeball of the highest order--I don't really know--but in this book, he sounded like an eager man in the pursuit of happiness. His final plea at the end of the book is poignant: \\"God, I love you...Take care of us all, one way or the other.\\"en being a hobo was an option, when riding a freight train was a considered choice, when the song lyric \\"I've got plenty of nothin and nothin's plenty for me,\\" from Porgy and Bess, held an attraction.

B004D2CPO0|4.0|After the critical success but commercial failure of his surrealist autobiographical trio ([[ASIN:B000M4RG06 Takeshis]], [[ASIN:B0015M652O Kantoku Banzai]], [[ASIN:B004SUIXWU Achilles and Tortoise]]), irector Kitano Takeshi said he wanted to make a flick that was just popular entertainment. Going back to his roots in the yakuza genre, the result of this commercial imperative is \\"Outrage.\\"<br /><br />Like when Kurosawa Akira made his \\"popular entertainment\\" flick [[ASIN:B00005B1ZL The Hidden Fortress]], Kitano can't really keep the art out of his filmmaking. He took an unusual approach when writing \\"Outrage.\\" After creating his list of characters, he decided how they all died then worked backwards creating a story that would accommodate their deaths. The result is a violent and merciless film, one where one small action tips the dominoes of death, which march on relentlessly until all fall down.<br /><br />The story is set in Tokyo, where Boss Ikemoto (Kunimura Jun, [[ASIN:B004XXGFCM My Darling is a Foreigner]]) is recently released from prison, and gathers at a meeting to pay tribute to the yakuza lord of Eastern Japan. It is known that in prison Ikemura swore an oath of brotherhood with gangster Murase (Ishibashi, Renji, [[ASIN:B002PHVHKS 20th Century Boys]]), an independent gangster who controls some turf and a drug operation. The yakuza lord worries about Ikemura's new loyalties; is he plotting with Murase for an over throw? Ikemura decides to allay these suspicious by picking a deliberate small-scale fight with Murase, opening an office on his territory and allowing one of his gangsters to fall for a Murase-scam so that he can demand reparations. The plan escalates, however, as there are those in both Ikemoto's and Murase's organizations who would take advantage of the strife to advance their own position by killing rivals.<br /><br />One of the interesting things about \\"Outrage\\" is that Kitano gives us no great plot to hang on to. Each player in the deadly game is pursuing their own agendas; be it to create revenue, level-up in the yakuza hierarchy, or simply take out some petty revenge. There is no overriding plot, no clever plan. The gangsters are opportunists, nothing more, each trying to figure out how to advance with their fingers and lives intact. When a line is cut, that story ends completely.<br /><br />\\"Outrage\\" seemed more authentic to the real, everyday operations of yakuza than most films in the genre. There are no super-killers or honorable outlaws. When I was watching the film, I found I didn't root for any particular character. No matter who came out on top in the end, nothing changed. It would still be business as usual exploiting innocent people and taking without earning as much as you can.<br /><br />In fact, this made me wonder at the title. There isn't much \\"outrage\\" in the film itself, so maybe Kitano's \\"outrage\\" is at the system that allows these bottom-feeders to exist. Or maybe it is Kitano's \\"outrage\\" that he has to fall back on crowd-pleasing flicks when few people appreciated his Art. Or maybe he just thought \\"outrage\\" sounded cool.<br /><br />The only issue I had with \\"Outrage\\" as a film was the pacing. The film got terribly slow in the middle, and a side-plot involving an illegal casino run out of an African embassy dragged on too long. I generally like Kintano's pacing, with films like [[ASIN:1567302238 Fireworks]] and [[ASIN:B0002W4TOO Sonatine]] balancing out the slow and bang-fast. Kitano's trademark oddball humor was also entirely missing from \\"Outrage,\\" and while I didn't want a lot of it a scene here and there would have been a welcome relief from the grim doings.is pursuing their own agendas; be it to create revenue, level-up in the yakuza hierarchy, or simply take out some petty revenge.

0307474275|3.0|I read this book two years after it came out, after all the hype had died down. I'm not one of those that goes to movies at their premier showing nor do I read the latest hot seller when it's hot. It's fast moving thriller about Robert Langdon, a symbologist from Harvard, who goes to Paris for a meeting with the curator at the Louvre that ends up being murdered by an albino monk before the meeting ever takes place. Accused of the crime, Robert ends up on the run from the French police with the curator's cryptologist granddaughter, Sophie. But the wise old curator left clues to a great secret in his dying moments so the chase is really about Robert and Sophie trying to find the Holy Grail while the police are trying to find them.<br /><br />This is full of puzzles, riddles, twists and turns and keeps the reader glued to the text with that age old question--what happens next? It's too complicated to retell the story but it's about the Priory of Sion, a secret society founded in 1099 whose members included Isaac Newton, Botticelli, Victor Hugo, and Da Vinci, that possess a dangerous secret--the Holy Grail--that is also being sought by Opus Dei, a conservative Catholic organization based in New York City. Opus Dei, under the direction of the Pope, wants to suppress or destroy the information, as it is a great threat to Christianity.<br /><br />The secret is that The Holy Grail is really in the person of Mary Magdalene and what is sought, when one speaks of looking for the Holy Grail, are documents that prove Mary to have been the wife of Jesus, his partner in the gospel of the sacred feminine. The underlying theme of the book is that the Catholic Church, in their patriarchal wisdom, suppressed the news that Jesus was married and had offspring because it destroyed the notion of his divinity and thus the power of the Church. According to this thesis, the \\"historical Jesus\\" was only human, a great human to be sure, but not a divine being. It advances the theme of the feminine side of God's nature that was, over and over, demonized by the Church starting at Nicea about 300 AD, when the books of the Bible were selected. But alas, there are missing documents that tell the real story!<br /><br />The novel throws in everything but the kitchen sink to advance this theme of Catholic bashing--Eve, Original Sin, the Inquisition, the burning of witches (reference: the 15th century book, The Witches Hammer), the yin and yang of femininity and masculinity, Knights Templar, goddess theory, Emperor Constantine's political motives for declaring Christianity the official religion--it was all about power and politics--and the men won. It's conspiracy theory stuff-- and if one can read it as an entertaining work of conspiracy fiction, all well and good--but it isn't religion. Or maybe it is? Maybe it's another religion and I just don't recognize it. Oh well, it's not my religion. I like good fiction; but I never found one good enough to establish a new religion in me. And what is the Da Vinci Code? It refers to the painting, The Last Supper. The person seated at the right hand of God was not male, but was a disguised Mary Magdalene, Da Vinci's little joke.<br /><br />I would love to read a review of this novel by C. S. Lewis, but since he's been dead since 1963, no such luck. I have an idea of what he'd say.<br /><br />What somebody else (my source was lost) said was that the book followed a formula:<br /><br />Initial setup--arrive at location--an intelligent Harrison Ford type, without a clue as to what is about to occur.<br />Pontificate in a manner and breadth no human ever could or would.<br />Repeat incessantly, without tiring, over a 24-hour period (within 450 pages).<br />Conclusion--a weak one, at that.ine side of God's nature that was, over and over, demonized by the Church starting at Nicea about 300 AD, when the books of the Bible were selected.

0061146307|4.0|I have a 9 year old who is very fussy about what he reads.  He's not a passionate reader like his big sister so when he started reading this first book in the series I wasn't sure he'd be interested in it.  I was pleasantly surprised when I saw him read the book over the course of a couple of days and reading without any prompting from me or his father.  He's now read books 1,2,3 and is currently reading 4.  He says they're all very exciting and interesting.  I'm so happy I pushed him to start the first book.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|I'd love to play this game more, but at this point, it keeps crashing. There is a version that isn't updated on google play that doesn't have this problem.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|I really like this app but it makes it hard to enjoy when you have to force close after everything you do.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|Very fun until it force closes and forces you to wipe the data and start all over. I tried everything I could think of before wiping out my progress, but that was the only choice. Too bad too, I liked what I saw. I reached about 40 items twice before it got screwed.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Very entertaining and I look forward to the films. The price is affordable and deffinately a good buy. I have no complaints!
B0067AC5KA|2.0|I can't for the life of me understand all the hype and excitement this book and series have received.  It's honestly just not all that good. Larsson uses 200 words where a couple dozen could do. The endless exposition of pointless detail doesn't add color or excitement, just pages... and pages... and pages.  In contrast to the mind numbing detail about every aspect of every room, and the endless and often pointless development of people who are not involved in the least in the story, you have the hilariously unimaginative ever present staple of coffee and sandwiches. Evidently, based on the first book, a Swede's near total dietary consumption is made up of coffee and sandwiches. I think there was only one time where he even mentioned what kind of sandwich, but you'll know every detail about every room anyone enters.  Perhaps it was a subliminal suggestion to keep the reader interested in making coffee and thereby awake enough to keep going.<br /><br />I won't go into all the plot details as others have already done so. Just know that it's a grind of a read. There are a few morsels of plot interest to keep you feeling like you may as well hang in there to see how it ends, but overall you end up feeling like an abused spouse who just sticks around hoping that your partner will get better. To wit, since I bought all 3, I waded into book two. Now at 30%, I'm finding myself in the same boat. Too much time invested and a smidge of curiosity are all that's keeping me from going to the menu on my Kindle and starting over with another book.<br /><br />If you're a golfer like me, who has maybe a half dozen nice shots out of 95, and those half dozen shots are enough to keep you slogging through the other ones while wondering why in the hell you didn't just stay home and have coffee and sandwiches, then this series is for you.  Otherwise don't bother, and keep your curiosity about the sanity of your friend who recommended this to you to yourself.<br /><br />I need a James Patterson fix, stat.
0307719774|5.0|Got this book yesterday and love it!! It is small, but I like that. And even though it is small it has just enough room for writing short answers to the short questions. The idea that in a year or two I can easily see what my answer was the year or two before seems like a great idea. As with most books I get like this, I love it so much I will buy some to give as gifts. My only real complaint, like someone else wrote here, it's a really nice looking book but no ribbon maker, seems odd, not a big deal but would have been a nice addition to such a nice book.

B004T2QZL8|5.0|it is like my fav game but i wish Doodle devil was free on my dads smart phone it was
B004T2QZL8|1.0|I got this app this morning as the free app of the day.  It worked great for the first 15 minutes, but then has been force closing every time since when I try to open it.  All I got to do was match a few elements together to make new ones, which truthfully became tedious.  This is an app fail.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|good brain game, love that there are hints when u really get stuck. if u like puzzles u will like this game.
0307719774|2.0|I found myself bored with this journal since the questions are just not creative imo. For example here are some of the questions- What is your work ethic, where do you live, describe your spirituality, are you original or the remix (WTH), did you kiss someone today, describe home, what type of music do you like. Some of these answers are the same for five years, so why are they even in the book. I'm probably going to start crossing out the questions and creating my own since these questions don't fit me at all.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|This game would be much more fun if it actually worked and didn't force close every 5 seconds. Very very annoying and frustrating!
B002BU0DPE|5.0|I was never careful with my turtle beaches. I cared for them enough but not all that much and they still have survived for a long time( about 6 months). Now one of the speakers is hanging but that is because I wasn't careful. The quality is excellent, you can hear everything loud and clear. The mic is no problem, all my friends have the same one and I can hear them just fine.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|I was having fun combining all the elements, finding new ones but then it force closes when ever I enter the game :(
B007BLCGNU|3.0|The direction was good, but the content was diluted by too much time spent (in what I think is an effort in) building the character.
B000QCS8TW|1.0|I bought the book a couple of weeks ago and reading it is a pain due to some problem with the spaces between some of the words. Can not talk about the content. The product is poor from the editorial point of view.
0307949435|3.0|Got a lot out of the book, but, trying to put the words into action, have not had too much success. Started to lose fat, not pounds, which was OK, but now have plateaued. Just stuck, with no more fat loss. Have to start reading the book again, to see where I am going wrong.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is very cool. you get a lot of games in one. it also is free. its a very good buy.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|one of the most complete movies about americas current food industry. it shows us tyson and perdue chicken houses which most americans have ate before and shows you how they are raised in dark rooms in doors. it shows how the animals are being abused and what they are fed. it shows us corn and what our goverment is doing to have ridiculous amounts of corn grown and nothing else. corn is used for everything. its fed to animals and fed to humans, almost every processd food in the supermarket and fast food contains corn and hows its killing us. and it shows monsanto, the company which gentically modifies our seeds and bullies local and small farmers.<br />in this movie you will get a chance to see a rare free range livestock farm in virgnia of joel salatin. its beautiful and such a awsome farm. however most americans have not had a chance to eat fresh food like this. so if your wondering why are over 70% overweight, why were are over 30% obese, why so many americans are sick and have diabites then watch food inc. see the story how many of us dont have the choice to eat local and fresh food becuase the corporations how only giving us thier choices. the FDA who was suppose to protect us and the supreme court has monsanto's peoples running it.<br />extras in this movie show you chipotle mexican grill and how fast food can be different. how they have food with intergity.ock but naturally these animals dont eat corn but are forced to which makes them fat, sick and brings more e coli. there has been millions and millions of pound of food recalls from beef to spinich. but with monsanto gentically modifying our country with corn, we have so much corn in america you can do anything with it.<br /><br />it shows monsanto. how many of our goverment, president adminstrations, FDA, supreme court has monsanto and other corporations in it so no one really regualtes these corporations. monsanto is the worlds worst nightmare. they gentically modify our seeds so thier chemcials can work on it. they own over 90% of corn and soy in this country and 80% of process foods have GMO's. the food industry is a mess. what you can do change this? buy foods in season and locally at a farmers markets. grow your own garden if you can.
0312641893|4.0|Cinder is a cyborg, the best mechanic in New Beijing, and unafraid to get her hands dirty. She's an endearing character, especially when it comes to her genuine love for those who she cares about. The narration switches mostly between Cinder and Prince Kai, giving a well-rounded view the events taking place as the intimidating Queen Levana of the Lunars visits....and things get pretty complex once she shows up. As the story begins to delve into political conspiracies and the illness sweeping New Beijing, it only becomes more intriguing. Meyer has a way with words that keeps you turning the pages, eager for more. Building off of the bare bones of Cinderella's story, Meyer shapes Cinder into something unique and spectacular.<br /><br />HIGHLIGHTS: Despite being inspired by Cinderella, Meyer takes smart creative liberties that work very well. A few moments, especially with the Lunar queen, had me hooked as the suspense built. One the largest highlights involved the characters - Iko (an android), Peony, and Queen Levana. Even the fact that not all the characters were safe from harm was an interesting aspect that I respect.<br /><br />LOWLIGHTS: Some aspects of the plot were extremely predictable (Personal bias - I hate obvious twists), and not just the Cinderella aspects. The story also had a slow beginning. And the ending was a bit unsatisfying - too many loose ends, even if this is a series.<br /><br />OVERALL: It's a solid beginning to a series and a very fun novel to read. I'll definitely be checking out the sequel!
B006OFN0SE|2.0|I admire and respect Clint Eastwood beyond words and I've watched Leonardo DiCaprio's growth as an actor with mounting approval.The outstanding Naomi Watts - who I've never seen give a poor performance - and the great Dame Judi Dench, who was fantastic as  Edgar's mother.<br />So, where was the mish-mash ? The script set out to find a fence right in the middle of the two historic forces. One believes Mr Hoover should be canonized, the other side would like to hang,draw and quarter him.<br />So from there you research and research again, and remove the splinters from the derriere and tell it how it was.<br />Just as Louis B Mayer removed Thalberg from his position of power at MGM, so too did Hoover on numerous occasions remove rightful FBI operatives from the limelight when catching notorios criminals,and took on the glory himself.<br />He victimised any FBI agent suspected of homosexuality and drove them out of the Bureau. Yet he was one himself.<br />He befriended underworld figures through the horse track, had no compunction about betting large amounts on \\"fixed\\" races,and was always reimbursed if a race didn't finish how it was supposed to. Hoover's hand didn't go into his pocket too often. It was because he compromised himself in this way, that he would never agree to any crack down on the very people who were lining his pockets. His refusal to acknowledge the existence of the Mafia was laughable.<br />Clyde Tolson joined the FBI in 1928 and three years later became Hoover's second in charge. Tolson and Hoover virtually lived together,lunched daily together,and always holidayed together each year. Hoover had the bugging devices in place to blackmail anyone in a position to remove him from his Directorship of the FBI.<br />This was touched on in the movie,when Hoover asks his secretary Helen Gandy to destroy his secret files on prominent Americans,plus all accompanying tapes should anything ever happen to him - which she did. He blackmailed LBJ,JFK,Monroe,Nixon,and in 1964, he wiretapped Dr Martin Luther King. He even had a wiretap on Mrs Eleanor Roosevelt,taken in a hotel room with Joe Lash, who was an advisor to FDR.<br />The evilness of Hoover, which knew no bounds - was skated over by Eastwood. Because of the inability of Preidents to stare down Hoover - he kept his job. For this reason, a closer investigation of Hoover's activities should have been essential to the making of this movie. For some reason, it didn't happen that way.<br />And the movie suffered irreparably because of it.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|force closes non stop on my droid bionic, could be a 5 star game if they fix it. Amazon has had some crap apps lately.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|This game is great and addicting, but it froze after an hour so I tried to uninstall it and then it wouldn't reinstall.
1594481717|5.0|This book is incredible. Even if you don't completely agree with Pink's logic, it's inspiring and interesting. It challenges you to develop your creative abilities along with your technical skill set. As someone who underwent years of engineering education, it served as a reminder to sharpen my innovative thinking. Sure the title is very one-sided, but if you can take this book for what it was for me - just a very well-written reminder that every really great accomplishment has taken innovation, vision, and creativity in synergy with systematic and technical thinking - you will love reading it and find yourself quoting it years later.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|I, personally, love Doodle God. I used to play it all the time online. When I saw that it was the free app of the day, I was very excited. It played fine for a while, but now force closes every time I make a wrong combination. However, still a very fun game that everyone should try.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|It was great at first and I still like it but then when I mix certain materials it had to force close. That's why I gave it four stars.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this game is good for when your tired bored or a doctors office. so when you get bored play it.remember it is FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004T2QZL8|1.0|I enjoyed playing this game. BUT just as I was really getting into it....force close became an issue. I could not even play as each time I would try to combine elements, ham force close window.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|Yes. Great game, except...just as the other reviews said &quot;Keeps force closing.&quot; It worked till I got to about 20 elements created. Now it's open, start, force close. :( Btw I have an EVO design 4G. If you do also??? Don't even think about it, because It's not gonna happen unless the game designers make some serious changes.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|when I got this game it was really fun but then it forced closed endlessly and was really boring. then two hours later they created an update that fixed it! talk about hard work!
B005Y423ZC|4.0|Granted this is a live concert and you would expect such language from a punk rock group, but...I didn't know that she could \\"cuss like a drunken sailor\\".  Don't get me wrong; the music is great but I am a bit reluctant about playing it within earshot of my pre-teen son...
B004T2QZL8|1.0|After creating the first 50-100 elements, it stopped working. Now, whenever I try to create an element it force closes. Now I can't play the game because it always force closes.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|I have never read any of stieg larrsons books but i have always been interested in this series and i went into this show not knowing what i was getting into but was so  pulled into the story. you really care for the characters and by the end of the movie even though you had been watching it for 3 hours i wanted more. definately a movie i would recommend if you can stomach some of the more gruesome parts of the story.
B004GXHOGK|5.0|Another great Schleich toy.  My 3 year old son has a growing collection of these.  He picks a new one every day to be his animal to tote everywhere.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|i loved the way carter and sadie are always saving each other and its nice how they look out for each other
B004T2QZL8|1.0|this is my only review ever written...it force closes after 20 creations... don't waste your time on my moto droid
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book was suggested to me by a co-worker. It is a story on my own I never would have read, the story line was too unusual. But her raves about never putting it down intrigued me. Also the fact that another co-worker said she didn't like it, couldn't get into it. I was curious. I LOVED it. I found it fascinating, so truly unusual. Strange and interesting. You have to find out how it ends, you will be surprised.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|No spoilers here.  Go in expecting the unexpected!!  Hardest one of trilogy to read because katniss was in so much pain the whole time.
B005ELZKWS|1.0|Joe Satriani is capable of much more.  I think this album along with the first one proves that Joe just can't write actual rock songs (outside of his solo stuff) that are more than just mediocre.  Everything is just so bland and average.  I wish he would go back to doing Surfing with the Alien type music.  He was so great and inspired back then.  Anyway, I know people here don't like the comparison, but the new Van Halen Album \\"A Different Kind of Truth\\" absolutely destroys this waste of time.  I hope CF changes things a lot for their next album.  I will keep buying them, but I'm starting to lose faith that they will come out with anything decent in their current form.  I do think, however, the drummer is really good, and that shows on this album.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Adventure!  That's what it is.  Go more attached to characters!  So easy to read.  Content was a little mature, but I found myself yelling for them to do what needed to be done!  Team Peeta!!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I was up set at first but the problem was fixed quick today.  now it is working great. good for passing time

067960085X|1.0|When I first started to read Truman Capote's Breakfast at Tiffany's, I had my reservations.  Having never read Capote before, though, I went into it with an open mind.  Admittedly, the first dozen or so pages, I was starting to understand the writing style of Capote and noticed that he did keep a good flow to his work.<br /><br />The story of Holly Golightly is one that has captured the imaginations of pent-up housewives for years, just dreaming of the day they can run away to New York City and live among the socialite class.  Capote did do a fantastic job of painting an image of Holly in our minds, and certain aspects of her have become immortalized in American society; i.e. the \\"little black dress\\".  Having never seen the film adaptation, I did keep picturing Audrey Hepburn as Holly (although, in my mind, she spoke like Katherine Hepburn from Philadelphia Story, don't know why...).  The fact that he imagined Marilyn Monroe while writing her does change my perceptions of the character.<br /><br />That being said, however, the impact of Holly Golightly on society is about the only positive that I can take from the story.  The story, itself, I found to be a difficult read.  Not difficult because of the writing style (which did seem fragmented at times), but because I had a hard time sympathizing with both the narrator and Holly.  Holly, to me, seemed selfish and disconnected from the real world.  She realizes that every man she meets falls instantly in love her, a fact that she exploits often.  She gets what she needs from them, always teasing them that there might be a future there, yet there never is.  She often comes across as a child, not seeing the world for what it really is.  While this can be blessing at times for some people, her inability to deal with reality made me see her as irresponsible.<br /><br />The narrator is not without fault though.  He comes across as a spineless, welcome mat of a man for Holly to wipe her feet all over.  His obsession over Holly comes across as sad and pathetic.  He knows that she will never love him like he loves her; however, he continues to stay in the relationship and bend to her every whim.<br /><br />But maybe I'm too calloused... I personally have gone through the trials of unrequited love, but then I turned 15 and realized that pining over someone who doesn't love you is a waste of time.<br /><br />Finally, I don't feel the story came full circle, as we never find out whether or not that was Holly's face on the carving in Africa.  It is a small detail, but it is still left unanswered.  Overall, I didn't feel a connection with any of the characters in the book, which made it all the less interesting.  I believe that the premise of the story had some promise; however, Capote's inability to create relatable characters makes this book hard to recommend.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|I have no need for large memory using. &quot;pretty&quot; app.  Pykl radar is a much better application for me.  I have not received a promotional free gift from the makers of Weather+  for this product review.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|Game worked great for first half hour. After that, every time I tried to combine something, it would force close.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I believe this game is fun for all ages and is also pretty addictive. In just a matter of days, I have gotten quite a few people playing this game and were immediately hooked.
B006JTS5OO|3.0|I just purchased a copy of the new Muppets movie and I would like to point out something to anyone who is buying this Muppets Wacka Wacka Combo Pack.<br /><br />It states that what is \\"included\\" is a DVD, Blu-Ray, Digital Copy , and Soundtrack. HOWEVER the Digital copy and Soundtrack are NOT included. You have to type in a code to download them off the internet, even though it says all over the packaged \\"INCLUDED\\" and NO mention anywhere on the box about having to be downloaded.<br /><br />I just off the phone with Disney and they are aware of this packaging error , and said they would look into it and get back to me. I'm not gonna hold my breathe until I'm as blue in the face as Gonzo though.<br /><br />Also if you download the soundtrack, again don't be fooled as it says \\"Full Soundtrack \\" but it is not. The original soundtrack consists of 30 tracks, but the Wacka Wacka Combo Box only lists 15 as the FULL Soundtrack. Yes there are 15 songs and the other 15 are dialogue from the film, so depending on how you look at it, it could be considered the full soundtrack of songs but not the full soundtrack if you buy it in the store.<br /><br />The movie itself I thought was very good , even though nothing beats the classic muppets films, but still over all for any muppet fan it is worth seeing.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|this app is every creative mind's dream come true. there are do many things you can do with this app!! get it NOW.. you will not be disappointed!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I'm getting so sick of these apps that don't work, thinking of ditching the Kindle Fire for something with less restrictions and hassles. You're gonna lose me Amazon if you don't start investing in getting more good apps for this market.  UPDATE: The developers fixed it. Seems to work perfectly now. Highly recommend.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|What else to say then I loved it. Was nicely written, story line Excellent and lovable characters. I will stop myself at that because everyone knows now about the Hunger games trilogy. Just read them all, they are worth it.
B000P0J09W|5.0|This movie is a classic. Fun for all ages. I have been watching this movie for over 20 years, and still love it. The Goonies is the story of a group of young teens in the search for a legendary hidden treasure, in order to save their town from being turned into a golf course. They have a map, bad guys chasing them all the way, fun and adventure.
B0071BY1ZQ|5.0|Five BIG Stars!! Exciting, excellent jazz performances. Don't let the title \\"Ode\\" fool you, this cooking CD captures one of the tightest, most original trios on the jazz scene today, led by jazz virtuoso pianist & composer Brad Mehldau, with great support & solos from Larry Grenadier on bass and Jeff Ballard on drums, in mostly blazing, inventive, hard-swinging performances. As explained in the liner notes, this 'all- Mehldau compositions' set contains 'odes' dedicated to family, friends, peers, and even a favorite Jack Nicholson \\"Easy Rider\\" movie character. Mehldau uses a thoughtful compositional technique where he writes for each player's strengths, and then lets the performances grow organically into the final rhythmic and harmonic frameworks when they become 'ripe'. The 'best of the best' begins with the tempo-shifting, bluesy \\"M.B.\\" (for the late, great saxophone titan Michael Brecker) with its attractive, almost subliminally familiar theme. The lyrical (meta) \\"Ode\\" builds beautifully over an insistent Ballard beat. \\"26\\" is a sizzling Mehldau performance that cooks for most of the 8 inventive minutes. The quirky \\"Bee Blues\\" has Brad playing simultaneous, ambidextrous notes in both theme and solo, with a hip bass solo from Grenadier. The funky \\"Kurt Vibe\\" has Grenadier and Mehldau interweaving ideas over Ballad's backbeat. \\"Stan The Man\\" has a great Ballad drum solo. And perhaps best of all is \\"Twiggy\\" dedicated to Brad's wife, jazz singer Fleurine, which is both beautiful and complex, with Brad's hot solo driven along by a skipping gait, some single note 'comping', and latin accents underneath from Ballad; likewise for \\"Days of Dilbert Delaney\\", dedicated to his son, which is 9 minutes of trio cohesion and excellence; and the unique \\"Wyatt's Eulogy for George Hanson\\", a wonderful, rather free-ish 5-note invention wherein each player supports and contributes simultaneously. The Brad Mehldau Trio's first studio recording in 7 years is superb jazz music, generous in time, and gets my HIghest Recommendation. Five SMOKING Stars!

B004T2QZL8|5.0|This game user interface is alot better than alchemy, the user interface and graphics are alot better than some of the other alchemy games out there. Three interface is great, which makes it allot easier to play
B004T2QZL8|1.0|Like the title says, the issue with the force closing down right ruins this little game. I was genuinely intrigued until it started force closing on me. Now, as soon as I try to combine an element, it force closes on me.<br />I would be more than happy to give this game five stars, but until then, it only gets one.
B006SMLAMQ|3.0|Has really nice graphics and lots of information can be set to display but the widgets are hard to find and so only available when you own the app
B0073ODRKG|5.0|For anyone not owning all of Madonna's in-studio albums (like myself) this is a wonderful set to purchase. Yes, you may not be getting her soundtack and live albums in this release, but you are getting all of her Warner Brother's studio albums with their complete tracks with the original art work. The CD's are housed in cardboard sleeves which is the only problem I have with the set as I had hoped they would be put in plastic jewel cases, but I am not complaining. The price is also fantastic.<br /><br /> The following is a complete list of all of Madonna's albums in this set along with their release dates, Billboard Chart peak positions, their RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America) status in the U.S. and the total they each sold globally:<br /><br />1. \\"Madonna\\", July 27, 1983, 5 x Platinum, 10,000,000<br />2. \\"Like a Virgin\\", Nov. 12, 1984, Diamond, 21,000,000<br />3. \\"True Blue\\", June 30, 1986, 7 x Platinum, 25,000,000<br />4. \\"Like a Prayer\\", March 21, 1989, 4 x Platinum, 15,000,000<br />5. \\"Erotica\\", Oct. 20, 1992, 2 x Platinum, 5,000,000<br />6. \\"Bedtime Stories\\", Oct. 25, 1994, 3 x Platinum, 6,000,000<br />7. \\"Ray of Light\\", March 3, 1998, 4 X Platinum, 16,000,000<br />8. \\"Music\\", Sept. 19, 2000, 3 x Platinum, 11,000,000<br />9. \\"American Life\\", April 22, 2003, Platinum, 4,000,000<br />10. \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\", Nov. 15, 2005, Platinum, 10,000,000<br />11. \\"Hard Candy\\", April 29, 2008, Gold, 4,000,000
0062112430|2.0|While the premise was interesting, overall I found the plot derivative (1984 and Equilibrium) and predictable.  By the end of chapter one, I knew exactly what was going to happen, and wasn't surprised at all by the ending.  While Ms. Oliver's writing style has potential, her use of similes is distracting to the point where it was an effort to keep reading.  They are either strange (a bay surrounded by shore, like a belt cinching a waist) or cliché (...like a stone), and are found on nearly every page - sometimes as many as five per page.  The one interesting side plot (Grace) is not developed.
B0051BLT4O|2.0|Nothing much here for those with experience. The images are all pretty much the same portrait orientation, busy and cluttered, with almost all the same background. Not very inspiring or creative, a disappointment as I was hoping for more. It may be a good starting point for a beginner, but for an advanced photographer I suggest you look elsewhere. Really weak on lighting other than natural light through a window and then discusses using halogen work lights?<br /><br />Edit: This book has more to offer [[ASIN:B005G2FSNQ Food Photography: From Snapshots to Great Shots]]
B004T2QZL8|2.0|just like alchemy,  but better, until repeated force closure glitches happens. now the game is completely unplayable. glad the app was free, cant imagine paying three dollars for this game in its current condition. i will keep it on my kindle fire in hopes that an update will be released after all of these negative reviews are seen. this would have gotten five stars if only the developer had fixed the force closure issue.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|I avoided the Swedish film and the novel because, quite simply, I wanted to see this version first. I had no idea what it was even about. But by the middle of the opening credits, I knew I was about to see the best film I've seen in a long time. And it didn't disappoint.<br />I love that right away, our hero has suffered a legal defeat. That our heroine, while awesome, is also vulnerable. The whole journey the viewer is taken on is both shocking and fantastic. The tone of the film, the performances, and the story itself had me enthralled.<br />Since seeing this, I have viewed the first two Swedish films and am almost halfway through the novel. So far, nothing touches this film.
B0058VW36U|5.0|amazing! If your Zedong to buy this or not.. do it. do it now! this app is my favorite of all of my apps!
B004T2QZL8|4.0|...but not bad. Kept asking myself when the actual game was going to start, but it is quite good for what it is. Deducted a star for incorrect usage of the word &quot;addicting&quot; in the app description.
0767821769|5.0|This was a wonderful movie.  It was very realistic.  There were very touching moments as well as sad ones.  It held my attention the entire time.  I definitely recommend it.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|For me the game will not even download. I got to 72% then it froze. And every time I press install to try again it says &quot;bla bla bla bla, cannot complete bla bla bla bla please try again.&quot; Its so freaking annoying!
B003H06TZU|4.0|THIS IS A Fine Blu-Ray Disc but it is NOT 160 minutes. The other Blu-Ray offered on amazon is 2:25 or 145 min.  This version offers Theatrical and Extended but the Theatrical is 2:25 and the extended is just shy of 2:29. ALMOST 4 mintues longer.<br /><br />It is NOT 160 minutes -- It is 148.  So what is in the extra 3minutes plus?<br />I am not sure yet.  They might have included the intermission music not sure yet.<br /><br />As for extras...same as the other Blu-Ray but you're not getting the book pages<br />AND THIS EDITION LACKS THE EXCELLENT COMMENTARY ON THE OTHER EDITION.<br /><br />SO Pick one...but Pick wisely.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|when I started playing this game it was really fun but once I had it for a while, it got really boring. also the ads are rediculous.
B0063IH60K|1.0|New upgrade adds live action ads that pop up at random. Ruined a good game. Bye bye! Time to find new game.
B004GTLFNW|5.0|As a person who specializes in teaching others body weight only exercises and is the author of[[ASIN:B006Y35RP0 Ageless Beauty & Timeless Strength: A women's guide to building upper body strength without any special equipment]] I was very pleased to find a bunch of body weight exercises I have never seen before. Mark Lauren does a good job of communicating the many benefits of this type of exercise. And while he does talk a lot about his experience in the military it is good to know that these exercise are so effective that our military is using them to train recruits. I highly recommend this book for anyone wanting to build strength and get in shape using just their body.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|Enjoyed this game on Kongregate and was thrilled to download to my Kindle Fire.  However the constant force close issue has made it more hassle than its worth.  Great up until that became a problem.
082300659X|5.0|I have two previous books by Juliette Aristides - both are overviews of painting and drawing (no easy task) this book focuses a little more on technique and specific exercises. The highlights:<br /><br />a. beautiful reproductions and well chosen examples of master drawings both from old masters and contemporary artists.<br />b. insightful commentary. Although this is about technique - Aristides never loses sight of the 'big picture' (which by the way is an essential technique!)<br />c. More in-depth surveys' of drawing techniques including master copying, rythmn and line.<br /><br />There is no substitute for an atelier and working with a master, but this book is as close as it comes.<br /><br />In her book \\"the creative habit\\" Twyla Tharp recounts a story of a master ballerina coming to a basic dance class and going through the 'basics' at the barre. She goes on to say that masters always practice and never lose site of the fundamentals. For that reason alone all artists, beginners and especially advanced artists, should have this on their bookshelves.<br /><br />There are a LOT of drawing books out there, but this is one of the best published in recent years.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun game, nice graphics. I like that it gives you options other than money for getting the dollars.  Easy to complete without paying. I would recommend it to everyone.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Doodle god is a game where you combine the 4 existing elements (fire, water, earth, and air) to create new things. Some combinations are realistic - some not so much.  Some examples would be water + earth = swamp or fire + water = alcohol.  Everything you create comes from the original 4 items or combinations of products FROM those 4 items.  (It's much like the game Alchemy - if you've played that one.)<br /><br />In this version of the game there are 248 things to create and 26 groups of elements to obtain.  (Earlier versions have less)<br /><br />So far I haven't had any freezing or force close issues on my kindle fire like a lot of people seem to be experiencing so this one rates high for me.  It DOES have open network sockets, but I'm stuck having to assume that it's used for the linkage to their twitter and facebook pages as it doesn't look like the app does anything else with it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Enjoy this game  Just when you think you have may not win an opportunity presents itself  and everytging goes together, Just fun. Set a timer because
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun game. Easy to see graphics. A bit addicting though. The auto finish speeds up the game. Great for killing time.
B007C4ZJ3K|1.0|This movie failed in every aspect of film making. The acting is poorly done and the soundtrack feels like leftover sound bites from Oceans Eleven. The story was a good idea that never really executes on the screen. Save your money and see something better.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|One of my favorite seasons.  The character development in this season is great, left me wanting more.  I highly recommend it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|yes!! every day I trust accuweather. it is real. I like.  I love it. day and. nite. is always right.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I was looking for a painting app for my 2 year old daughter and after checking ALL the apps available I found the best one.<br />I really like all the options it has: markers, pens, pencils, stamps, stickers, the palet of colors and more... We can also save the work done!<br />At the begining I got a problem to make it work... but I emailed the developer and INMEDIATELY I got an answer and a solution! Other companies will care less about that and will probably make you buy the product again... this is not the case. I highly recommend this app, it's great for children and grown ups. My daughter loves it and me too! I think you are getting a great app for a very low price = Amazing deal!!!
B004QK5N5W|3.0|Does not work with the new  iPad three works well with iPod touch 4g.<br />Received error message when plugged into the iPad
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|This app gives you exactly what was advertised and absolutely nothing more. The graphics and animations were pretty, but &quot;pretty &quot; isn't exactly what I'm looking for in a weather app. I wouldn't waste the space this app takes up on this weather app.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|would be good if it would play but the freezing is a huge issue so fix it so we can play it
0312641893|5.0|I borrowed Cinder from my daughter so I could keep tabs on what she's been reading, but I found myself unable to put it down. It's a sci-fi Cinderella story, but with enough deviations from the original plot to keep you interested.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|I also encountered the force close.  I made it 36 combinations in.  now it seems to force close no matter which two items I click on.  it was fun until this error...
B000002HJD|5.0|Very dark and poetic. Hes very insightful. Always love his music and poetry. He has a way of expressing his thoughts onto music and paper. Not that many people can do that.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|(This is a war between which is better. His mainstream debut \\"David Cook\\" or his sophomore set, \\"This Loud Morning\\".)<br /><br />I already knew that this album was way catchier and varied in sound. However, I also love \\"This Loud Morning\\" for its well of emotions. I like the arrangements better on this record though. Ultimately, I'm going to give both records the same score but if asked, this is the record I prefer. Listening to the album tonight proves what a treat it is to indulge in.<br /><br />Both albums are good. However, this one also has more upbeat tracks on it when the next record mostly stays at the mid-tempo range. My favorite is the rockin' \\"Mr. Sensitive\\". However, there are plenty of goodies like \\"Heroes\\", the glorious first single \\"Light On\\", the underrated \\"Life On The Moon\\", the beautifully vocal \\"Permanent\\", mid-tempo rocker \\"Avalanche\\" and the track full of attitude \\"Bar-Ba-Sol\\".<br /><br />I'd say get the whole album as opposed to just downloading a few tracks. It's that good.<br /><br />4.5 stars.<br /><br />DOWNLOAD:<br />\\"Mr. Sensitive\\"<br />\\"A Daily AntheM\\"<br />\\"Heroes\\"<br />\\"Bar-Ba-Sol\\" &<br />\\"Avalanche\\"
B004T2QZL8|2.0|The game is wonderful. It's a great twist on the basic alchemy principle, but it force closes after awhile. I've tried twice now, and both times after about 30 min of game play I can't play anymore because it force closes as I combine elements. I want it to be one of my favorite games, but it's not playable.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|This watch was a great deal! I was debating between the Nike version and this one. All the reviews on the Nike website said \\"great watch for the price, almost as good as a Garmin\\", and this watch on Amazon was actually cheaper than the Nike. Very happy with it so far. I've had a few technical difficulties with the software (having to force upload, etc.), but it was probably due to the fact that I didn't know enough about it at the time. A friend of mine has trouble with hers taking awhile to locate satellites, but I haven't had any problems with that so far. It only takes a few seconds and you're ready to go. My only complaint is that it's bulky (the Nike appeared to be flatter which is the only reason I debated so long), but it's not so bulky you look like a freak sideshow when you're running. Definitely something I can overlook!
B004T2QZL8|1.0|ok so this game was fun...UNTIL the app closed unexpectedly on me and every time afterwards i tried to continue playing, i would hit the error again. everyone has been getting this error and its about time the problem should be addressed.
0439023513|5.0|If Katniss had lived happily ever after with friends and family intact, I would have felt disappointed with this trilogy because of the set up in the first and second books. Yes, I wanted a fairy tale ending, but I wouldn't have believed it. That's why I give this book 5 stars and why I think many readers will find it a satisfying conclusion. This story was ultimately about the cost of war and it was heartbreaking. I'm the type of reader that loved the \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy by Philip Pullman - it's not the same type of story or style of writing, but I think if you loved those books, you might also dig these.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Steve Jobs changed the world. He revolutionized industries and became a global titan. He took a failing company and turned it into the most valuable company in a mere decade. But he was more than just a businessman. Steve Jobs was a unique character and a charismatic leader in his own right. Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs is the only book that really takes you through all sides of the life of a mortal man and an icon.<br /><br />Isaacson's biography is very easy to read. All the stories, reflections, and interviews are genuine and truly gives perspective to the man behind Apple, Pixar, and NeXT. This is a wonderful book that gives you an idea of what it would be like to work besides Jobs and this is an amazing feat in and of itself. Although the book is over 600 pages, sometimes it seems somewhat lacking because you get a feeling that it doesn't go more in-depth into certain parts of his life. But then again, this is more so because how interesting Jobs is and how much more you want to read about him. Even though the book is 600 pages, you just feel compelled to dig deeper. The book keeps you hungrier and back for more!
B005RKBZEI|5.0|The first time you listen to this album, you may feel that it's just so so. But if you listen to it the second time and even more times, you will love every song of it. The more times you listen to it, the more you love Daz and his amazing voice!
B004T2QZL8|3.0|Like others, after completing 39 elements I now get a force close with any combination.<br /><br />Othwise a fun game with good graphics. The quotes are a nice touch for a bit of humor.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|same as everybody else. 25 elements into the game and every combo makes it FC. Love the game wish I could play it. Samsung Charge
B000FDFVZ6|4.0|Already knowing the storylines in  Alice Sebold's The Lovely Bones , I  chose to focus upon the vignette that actually opens the story while reading this wonderful book a second time.<br /><br />Inside the snow globe on my father's desk, there was a penguin wearing a red-and-white-striped scarf. When I was little my father would pull me into his lap and reach for the snow globe.  He would turn it over, letting all the snow collect on the top, then quickly invert it. The two us watched the snow fall gently around the penguin. The penguin was alone in there,  I thought, and I worried about him. When I told my father this, he said, \\"Don't worry, Susie; he has a nice life. He's trapped in a perfect world.\\"<br /><br />And so is Susie Salmon in her heaven in the lower case. She is not ready to be in her perfect world  after her neighbor brutally rapes and murders her. Her body is dismembered and totally concealed. She wants justice for Mr. Harvey and wants to be with her family, not heeding a warning that the living should be left alone. Susie watches her family self destruct because of her absence. Her father becomes obsessive with catching her killer, while her mother flees to the other side of the country.  Her sister completely changes, while her little brother grows up in a very fractured family and probably feels Susie's death more than the others. The botched Police investigation frustrates Susie, perhaps elongating her presence among her family and friends.<br /><br />Without characters like her Grandma, Ruth, and Ray and  the influence of magical realism and fantasy, The Lovely Bones would be maudlin rather than hauntingly  beautiful.  Sebold's use of a \\"body snatcher\\" scene did not appeal to me  and I thought it to be disquieting as Sebold's  rush to tie remaining loose story arcs at the end of the novel.  In my opinion,  The Lovely Bones is destined to become a  modern classic and is a solid 4 star read.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|this is an amazing game and right when you really start enjoying it that's when the forced closes start. such a shame..
B001L26THY|5.0|For the true Clapton fan this is a must have. The perfect collection for what he does better than anyone.
B003IPY4SI|5.0|I love Nikki Yanofsky's music even more than some of Ella Fitzgerald's. Nikki is one of my favorite artists because her songs are like the old standards, but more modern somehow, clearer and brighter than all my other favorites. She always manages to brighten up my day.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|This is a great game. I played it to death on Kongregate. The combinations are mostly intuitive and the graphics are simple and effective.<br /><br />The problem is the force close issue and it's a shame that people are rating down for that. It's understandable but I've decided to rate the game itself and hope for and update to fix the issues later.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|I would give the book 5 stars. It is fascinating, full of interesting and useful facts delivered in Bourdain's inimitable style, which I personally love.<br /><br />However, the ad states that it is free to Prime members, but it is not. I, a fully paid Prime member, downloaded it to my kindle on my Android tablet, and I was charged. When I asked why I was charged even though I have a Prime membership, Amazon refunded my money AND TOOK THE E-BOOK OFF MY DEVICE!. So I had to buy it again!<br /><br />I never found out why Amazon says it is free for Prime members. You have to buy it! Weird. This is the second time this happens to me.
B006SMLAMQ|2.0|Does not use GPS for getting weather at current location, useless but pretty.<br />Add current location and would be a cool app.
0525478817|5.0|I am a girl  who is a freshman in high school, and when my book pile was growing thin, I got on amazon and looked up the highest rated  books. This one seemed fair  enough judging by the description  and the first chapter, so I got it and read it. It took me about five hours to finish, and I cried like an absolute baby. It was so nicely written that I literally would sometimes set the book down and ponder a sentence or two. There's lots of humor and tiny romantic moments, but it kept me interested the whole time  I  read it. This is my new favorite book (It beat out Twilight- my favorite books as of four years), and I've already lent it to a friend who said she loved it too. I would recommend this to anybody who wants an amazing book to curl up with on a rainy day; I just advise that you don't read it in public or in front of family!
B004T2QZL8|3.0|i played for a few minutes and started to get into it, and then it froze. i had to pull my battery out.<br />i decided to give it another try. i played for a few minutes and started to get into it again, and it force closed.<br />samsung epic 4g<br /><br />edit: there are far fewer issues with force closes, freezing, and spontaneous closing since the update... but i'm still having issues.<br /><br />i just got the 248th element and assume there is some kind of awesome ending, but i don't know what it was, because the game froze and then closed itself. when i went back to the game it just had a note that i just got the last element. lame!<br /><br />that aside, there isn't much logic to the game - it ends up being mostly trial and error. the hints are nice, but i still felt like i spent a lot of time randomly clicking things in the hope that it would get me somewhere.<br />but even with that issue, which should be a major one, i still found myself wanting to generate all the elements. there's just something addictive about it.<br />plus, the graphics are excellent, the voice acting is great, and the quotes are sometimes amusing. the music and sounds are alright.<br /><br />so, for me, it was worth downloading for free. the initial status of the app was pretty terrible, but the update makes it acceptable. the existing issues and the lack of logic would keep me from paying for it though... unless maybe i started playing it on a friend's phone. then i might need to buy it to finish it.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|It is fun up until it crashes, throws you out, and loses your progress.  Really frustrating with whatever bug they have.  Fix it and Ill recommend.  Otherwise, don't bother.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I am addicted to this game! It is fantastic! It's great for passing time! Haven't had any problems at all.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|These books had me from the first page! What a wonderful series and so well written.  I enjoyed turning every page and will recommend to everyone that I can.  Can't wait for what's next!!!
B005K17RU0|4.0|I have found this to be very useful-it is quick and easy &amp; seems accurate!!! what a great free app!
B004UID2LC|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this app.  I have a kindle fire and it works perfectly.  I also really like the choice of to either download a video or as an mp3.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|using kindle fire this program crashes most immediately. too bad its an amusing game. supposedly you can get a more up to date. version on google
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|No widgets.  Weather inaccurate.  Too big for what it does.  Backgrounds are inaccurate and revolve to random images rather than what the weather is actually like.  Don't waste your bandwidth.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I love the original angry birds and this one is amazing if you liked the original click download now. :)
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Such a well written book. This is one of my favorites. I could not pu the book down and I have read it at least three times so far. Deborah Harkness goes into such detail you feel like you personally know every character. I have recojmen this book to three other people and they loved it. Even my father read and this is typically not his type of book reads. This is a MUST read! Loved it!
B002RI9PKO|5.0|Why? Why are some people successful? Why is the smartest guy in the room often not? Gladwell takes these fascinating questions and creates compelling accounts that explain seemingly inexplicable success. I won't go into the book as that's been covered by the other hundreds of reviewers, but suffice it to say that this is a fabulous read by a master thinker and author. Five stars.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|works so far. HTC incredible. its an ok game. lots of bad reviews. blah blah blah blah blah. blah blah blah zzzzz zzz zzz z
B004T2QZL8|2.0|this game needs an update, I'm on the first level and it keeps crashing on me... interesting game, but needs to be fixed

B0067QPVD2|5.0|2011's The Thing would be one of the better prequels I have seen for a while.<br />This movie is immense in detail and articulation. Nearly everything was filmed to perfectly set up the original The Thing by John Carpenter.<br />The director took this detail down to the ax placement (literally, in order to fit the exact height of Kurt Russell when he would later walk past it). The monster was created using a combination of up to date CGI effects as well as animatronics and make-up in order to give the creatures a more life-like look, be able to stay with what carpenter used, yet still stay with the times.<br />All in all, this movie is has the classic grotesqueness that only Carpenter could provide from the sounds, transformations, and look of The Thing.
B004W4N55C|5.0|i have nothing negative to say about this app! its awesome!!! i didnt realize it had a tuner so that just put this app over the top!!!!!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|If anything, this game is too short, but very beautiful and well thought out. Definitely worth the money. It took about two days for me to finish it without using any hints. Whenever I got stuck, I would put it down for a while and think about it, and when I came back to the game, I usually solved the puzzle easily. Very enjoyable game.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The second book in the Hunger Games trilogy.  Even more addicting than the first!  I can't wait to see the movie.

B0015DROBO|4.0|This book was a little tough to get into till about 1/4 of the way through. Don't give up! It was well worth the slow start. Excellent book. Now I want to see the movie.  Amazon verified purchase
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have the AccuWeather site and its Firefox app on my laptop. So, I know what they have to offer. I also had \\"The Weather Channel's\\" app already to be pre-downloaded on my Kindle Fire. But, after I tried it. I didn't much like it. It either had way to much of one thing and not enough of another. The AccuWeather app gives me the info I need when I need it and it doesn't give me anything I don't need. The current weather is excellent, the 15 day forecast works for me, and the radar view stays current to when I use the app. The setup and style looks great. And, it hasn't failed me yet. An app worth getting.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I'm writing this to hopefully keel others from making the mistake of reading these reviews like I did. I came her to read some reviews after I finished the book only to find A LOT of people (idiots and a-holes) reviewing the whole series and giving away the ending without spoiler tags. If you're thinking of reading the whole series, take my advice and don't risk reading any of the reviews posted here.<br /><br />As for the book, it was okay.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|I just had an update go through that fixed the force close issues and I love this app. while it takes time and brain-work to discover the elements, I'm having a blast with it!! the only thing I don't love is that, while there is a list of elements you've already matched, it continues to match them. that makes it difficult to pass through looking for new ones since it goes back to the major element list every match you make, whether you've already made it or not.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Love the widget in this app, gives great detail on the weather and lets you select multiple areas to display.
B006ZCWTV0|5.0|i love this cd. i like that bruce focus on the stuff going on in our soceity right now. i listen to this many times with my dad. i gotta say it one of the best cds i herd in a long time. i love bruce rising album so i grown to love the songs about whats going on right now.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|Well i hit the FC wall at 38 items and 10 groups.  It's a bummer cause this games grouping and comments and look is a huge improvement over alchemy.
B0073PZIYI|3.0|Justin Timberlake's acting has improved. Good storyline. Slow on some parts. All in all, okay movie. I'd wait for HBO.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|This game is really fun but it constantly crashes on the kindle fire. Why wont amazon just use normal android?
B004T2QZL8|1.0|this game is great I always play it on the computer but the version on the kindle keeps kicking me off the program
B004T2QZL8|3.0|No matter what I try I can't get this app to do any further pairings. Each attempt results in an unexpected shut down. Hopefully the next revision will solve this problem.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game is actually pretty fun and I would recommend it! I love most of the games and I just bought it!  if your looking for random games to play choose this app!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I tried it cuz its the free app of the day became addicted and then I get tormented with force closes after 28 elements. Please fix this. I wanna make a human! ;-)
B004UID2LC|2.0|It is O.K. I like it but adds pop up a lot.  Then again, adds pop up on all the free apps. People stop complaining!
B007BDK3SS|5.0|okay, I had to get this. I already tried the winter addition, and when I saw this, i just had to get it. my advice? get the freakin' game.
B006SMLAMQ|3.0|The thing that attracted me to this app is the look of the widgets in the screenshots. I decided to install it only to find there are no actual homescreen widgets. This was a major disappointment. This app is not as accurate as many other weather apps. So I'm sticking to Beautiful Widgets
B0051HNMTI|4.0|App is pretty good but one thing irks me about it.  We need to be notified about the specific changes that are being made in updates.  Just put a &quot;recent changes&quot; section in the app description and update that section any time you release an update and I'd be happy.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|just got the game it was fun for about 10 minutes now it keeps force closing needs a fix. If fixed I would give it a higher rating
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This game (after update) doesn't freeze! And I love the introduction!! The Doodle God I think is a dragon! The freezes aren't on the kindle fire, or at least mine. So I think that this is a decent free app comparing to the previous days......
B004T2QZL8|1.0|I would give 5 stars if I could actually posy the game but sadly it force closes every time I open it now
0553801473|1.0|First three books great, book four, not so bad - this one was so bad that I rented the audio book to finish while driving<br />The author himself states this was difficult to write - if you think he's Tolkien like, then consider this his Simarillon<br />Frankly, I don't care if he finishes the series anymore - he's lost the plot
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I absolutely could NOT put down the first book, it was amazing! But I currently cannot make myself get more than about 100 pages into the second book. I was so upset with the way the story went and I knew I wasn't going to finish the series if I didn't read the last chapter. Unfortunately, I'm still not sure I'm going to finish the series because the last chapters of book 2 and 3, which sort of recap the books prove to me that nothing gets righted in the end. I really feel like this story would have been better off left at just 1 book. If you like a little bit of everything in your stories, this is a book for you, however I do caution those who have lost children, this books has some graphic scenes in which young adults/children die in various manners.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it was pretty fun but not all that addictive if it wasnt free I would have never bought it!!!! :)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is awesome. I play a lot to pass the time. I also got the upgrade, I was nervous because there were some reviews that said they lost all their progress but I didn't loose anything.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|it is a great game a am happy I got it free today for just like alot of people I loved it at first but than then the force close started happining and just killed it could anyone tell me a game like it on amazon or on android market
B004T2QZL8|2.0|This game is great, but its so frustrating when the force close starts. I gave up. I hope they get it fixed.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Interesting game, but needs work. There is some lag at end of each level on my Toshiba Thrive.  It could use a level select option too.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|Has the potential to be a great game but played for 10 mins and now force closes every time I try to make a move. : (
B004T2QZL8|1.0|this app is very well done but it crashes on droid x2 and kindle fire. more words. more words. word.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|I thought this was going to be a super fun game since I really liked Alchemy. And it WAS a fun game... Until it kept forcing close. I'm super bummed out about that. Please fix and I'll give more stars. There's so much potential here!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this game -I think- is great for kids and works well on my kindle. if you download this and like it I would suggest getting Farm Story, and Bakery Story but NOT Fashion Story it is a waist of time and really boring.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great final book in a wonderful series! Highly recommend it! Couldn't put it down! will keep your attention and cause you to go to bed early just to read more!
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|I have not got around to watching this video yet. I bought it because of friends telling me how good the movie was. Thank you for delivering it so fast...
B007IXWKUK|5.0|While the first book had sexual encounters to carry the brunt of the plot, this book had more of a focused plot line.  Still sexually charged, this book kept me as enthralled as the first.  I can't wait to dive into the final book, although I'm bummed the series will be over!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This trilogy is AWESOME!  I started reading \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" and can not stop reading.  It was a little slow to start but once I got into it I couldn't stop reading.  This is a little different than I normally read but with the reviews my boyfriend recommended it and now I can't stop.  I'm on the final book and I just can't wait to see what happens.<br /><br />Ana and Christian are the most loveable characters.  Christian makes me angry but than he has reason to be the way he does and Ana is helping him fix these issues.  These books have them all, romance, suspense, and a good story line.  I thought it was too detailed but after a while these details are what keeps you hooked!<br /><br />Get the books, you wont regret it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great read; I read this book in a day and a half, and read the second book in even less time.  This book is highly sexual, which I was prewarned about, but I loved it!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book kept me captivated just like the first.  I couldn't put it down, staying up late and waking early just to find out what happens next.  I think about Christian (Fifty) and Ana as I'm drifting off to sleep wondering what will happen next.  This is a wonderful Trilogy and you wont be disappointed.<br />It is a little pricey but well worth it.  I don't usually pay over $5 for a book but these books are worth it.  This second book actually made me cry, I never cry.  I love how the book draws you in and keeps you involved.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I think the bug causing all the forced closures has been fixed. I downloaded the app later in the day and so far I've made 65 elements and have had no problems on my Kindle Fire.  Other reviewers have said they get a FC around 40 elements or less.  Hopefully the developers have read the negative reviews and got on the ball to fix the problem.  Seems that they have.  Fun game!  Very amusing.
B0063IH60K|5.0|addicted to solitaire on my kindle. great app. I like the different games choices. I rate it as five stars
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Love. Just wish it wasn't all twitter related. Used it a lot when a severe storm came through our area.... I just edited my review because they changed it and now I don't like it. Plus it hasn't been worming for me. I liked the format of the old one much better.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It is hard to put down. It is really engaging and also fun to read. Strongly recommended. There are violence and killing, but they are meaningful.
B005CGI3ZG|4.0|Do NOT buy this box-set if you've never seen Dawson's Creek before. Borrow it or rent it. This should be common sense but it seems some people have purchased this thing without ever having seen a single episode. Not smart, guys.<br /><br />That said, I grew up with Dawson's Creek but admittedly I stopped watching after season 3. I think the characters and their situations outgrew me (I was barely in high school when they were in college.) This pack is (almost) perfect for catching up on what you may have missed. I say \\"almost\\" because I had a few skipping problems. One scene absolutely refused to play and so I had to jump ahead and piece together what happened through dialogue.<br /><br />The skipping may have to do with the fact that the packaging isn't all that great. The seasons are literally stacked on top of each other, disc after disc, with only a cardboard piece fitted in to insure the discs don't slip out of their nooks.<br /><br />Other reviewers have complained about the fact that the music has been changed in some scenes and that the newer songs don't fit the way the originals did. I would have to agree. Dawson's Creek was great for a lot of reasons. Picking the right music to fit a great scene was one of those reasons. For instance, they replaced Savage Garden's \\"Two Beds and a Coffee Machine\\" (the principal's final address to the protestors), Billie Myers' \\"Kiss The Rain\\" (Dawson and Joey embracing in the rain), and Splender's \\"I Think God Can Explain\\" (Dawson's love letter to Gretchen). I hated that! Those were great, memorable scenes that worked mainly because of the songs. That was a big disappointment.<br /><br />Overall, Dawson's Creek is a great trip down memory lane. You'll find yourself appreciating the long-winded dialogue exchanges, the undeniable wit therein, and loving and hating the characters all over again. I fell in love with Jack and Jen and thought their relationship was the greatest one in the show. Not a huge fan of Pacey (although Idon't see him quite as detestable as I once did) and always believed that Dawson and Joey should've wound up together at the end of all things.<br /><br />This box-set won't disappoint long-time fans and is a perfect gift. It's also surprisingly cheap. The full series for less than $60? That is one heck of a deal.
0812973992|5.0|This is not the typical book for me.  I usually go for the Victorian age or older.  However, I decided to give this book a chance due to the awards and excellent reviews.  I became very interested in the tightrope walker (Philippe Petit) and went on to watch the documentary on the man and his crazy plan.<br /><br />This book only spends a little time on the whole tightrope walker episode.  Most of the time you are learning about a complex group of characters trying to survive tough times in New York's worst neighborhoods.  The choices they make and the lives they live are not preferred, wanted, or what we typically call normal.  However, they are struggling as best they can.<br /><br />Reading this book is a bit painful.  The situations described, the decisions the characters make are very real.  It is almost as if this were a documentary.  The more you learn about each character, the more you want to know.  The writing it very good and the characters are deep, wide, and believable.<br /><br />Pros:<br />o excellent character building<br />o the interweaving of multiple story lines and the final climax is very good<br />o setting descriptions take you back with ease to 1970s New York<br /><br />Cons:<br />o somewhat of a tough read - bad things happen and you really don't want them to<br /><br />Overall - I highly recommend this book.  It is so well written, the character are so believable.  I was thinking about it for weeks after finishing it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it keep me Bessy when I don't have noting to do.I like the different games. it has to offer.it keep you focuses. I dealt love this game.
B001LF3YQK|4.0|I bought this case at Target a while back and I really like it. I small pack of the pampers sensitive wipes will fit perfectly in in. It stays closed pretty well for me, but then again I don't hang it up by the strap (like some of the other reviews complained about). I use it to grab it quickly out of the diaper bag (VERY handy). The one complaint I have is that the red cover comes off too easily so if someone else uses it for the first time, they pull it right off. It's not immediately apparent that it is supposed to slide back and forth. But, the button goes back on pretty easily too so at least it's not a fight to get it to work again. Overall, though, I think it's a pretty nice, sturdy case and I would recommend it to my friends.
B0000844M8|4.0|Educational film about the life of lions and their keepers. I had NO CLUE that the KING? of the JUNGLE was more into GTL than the female, how on earth did this instinctual(?)behavior evolve? Queen Bee I comprehend, but Hunt, Kill, Have Kids, Raise Kids, Defer to KINGY until he is satisfied, I was shocked, understand a human male desiring this lazy existence but a phenomenal animal worthy of great physical feats of challenging duels with other comparable animals and yet, nada??? Loved the story and could not believe that lioness just jumped up on the diminuitive female trainer like a lab retriever and she held her own!! More impressive was the relationship portrayed in the film between the humans, Mom n Dad. In the middle of the desert for years, rather alone with each other 24/7 and it looks soooo easy like clockwork and what a delightful existence and feeling sad for my contentious relationships ONLY to discover they drove each other crazy!!! sigh, feel better now.... Great film for animal lovers and this one especially for the magnificent scenery and accomplishments of reverting tame to wild for survival.
0062124293|4.0|After a sketchy start, I eventually decided that I love this book.<br /><br />The beginning made me...well, just uncomfortable.  All those bad words, and that intimate stuff about teenage discoveries and the attendant angst.  Then there was the bit about those bad words, and one word in particular, that we should claim back, that we should desensitize.  I'm talking language that I never heard until I was well into adulthood, that I could not even consider uttering in front of my mother.<br /><br />And then I started laughing.  This book is really hilarious.  Laugh out loud funny, as cliched as that is.  Even the generous use of capitalization and exclamation marks, something that normally drives me batty, were funny, very tongue-in-cheek.  Funny enough to keep me completely entertained while the author segued to the serious stuff with hardly a notice by me.  The chapter on abortion was not funny but was so soul-baringly honest that I found it very touching.<br /><br />The message is especially important too.  I am probably not mainstream audience for this book, being older (and not British) so I didn't get some of the references.  And I've heard most of this feminism stuff before and am old enough to not take the accomplishments of early feminists lightly.  Nothing terribly enlightening in this book.  What is wonderful is that all of this, all the feminist stances and those that seem almost the opposite of feminism, were strung together in such a smart, funny, and, against all odds, respectful way.<br /><br />I don't always have the same opinions as the author, but most of them are spot-on from my point of view.  I recommend this book for anyone able to deal with bad language, explicit descriptions, and a great deal of honesty.
B001E45XT4|1.0|I used the headset for about a week when all of a sudden the microphone stopped working without notice.  This seems to be a common problem with these microphones.
B004OR1X6A|5.0|Incendiary performance from Rory Gallagher, live from the legendary Old Waldorf (San Francisco). Simply put,one of the greatest blues guitarist's of his generation. Non-stop guitar pyrotechnics combined with a great back up band.<br />The set feels like a runaway freight train ending with a dazzling two song encore. Must have for any blue-rock fan!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|the first and second were better. i found myself bored at some parts. not bad but not great. but im sad the series is done. 4stars
B004T2QZL8|1.0|the force close issue is enough to rate 1 star.  if the creator fixes this I'd gladly give it 5.  as it is, it's not playable - just annoying.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Awesome it is so fun when I get to unlock new games!u should get this game I down loaded this game for my little brother. but now I am addicted. to it

0470638842|4.0|Socialnomics' ten chapters are outlined to inform the reader about the benefits and pitfalls of today's social media environment. The book gives many concrete examples on today's and yesterday's use of social media.<br />This book is really written for anyone. The author has made it interesting for a broad audience. This book is for you whether you want to learn more about social media in general, or if you are a business-person trying to make sense on how to use social media for your organization, or if you just want a good read on an exciting and very relevant topic. As a reader with the lack of the outmost interest of social media, I found the book to be very well written and easy to follow. I really liked the authentic examples that the author used in order to demonstrate some of the key points.<br /><br />Overall a good read.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|how do u get the mighty eagle someone plz help its frustrating I mean seriously I don't think I'm the only one
B004T2QZL8|1.0|Can't play once you get to a certain level.....force closes with every combination.  You would think with all of the reviews and complaints discussing the same issue, they would try to fix it.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is so fun to play you can do all theses things and it is worth paying .99 so you should buy it
B004T2QZL8|4.0|This app is great.  It took a while, especially the first time I opened it, to load.  Just give it a moment.  I actually had to click the &quot;Wait&quot; button instead of the &quot;force close&quot; button.  It of well worth the wait.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun game to play and spend time on. can be hard to get point's but the more advanced games are better and worth the trouble to get to.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|would be a fun app  if it didn't force close once I got to 47 elements. no it wont let move past that point F.C. every time!
B004T2QZL8|1.0|would have been a decent app if it didn't keep forcing its self to close.  I eventually deleted it from<br /> my kindle.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|Good game but the force close kills it.they have got to fix this.fix it fix it fix it fix it
B004T2QZL8|1.0|This would definitely be a five star game if it didn't force close every other second. seriously, fix this joybits! I really enjoy the game, or what little of the game I was able to play before it started crashing. It's a great puzzle game. Played (briefly) on the Kindle Fire
B0009LNRLE|5.0|When i first heard Yeti (a dbl album of exceptional scope & musical quality) many years ago I thought this is the best music i have ever heard & figured it may be difficult to surpass in both experimentation and compositional excellence (It remains still in the top 10 albums i have heard). It lifts off from Syd Barrets Pink Floyd & possibly the Velvet Underground when they still had John Cale,in a much more symphonic & extended manner with 2 sides approximating musical nirvana at least for me & obviously many other music officiandes as well. Miss this album at your own sonic peril & enjoy it till you are unable to appreciate anything else approaching its melodic experimental grandeur.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This game was a lot of fun until I had 28 elements. Then randomly it started to force close every time I tried to do anything.  Hopefully this will be updated soon since it really is a fun game.<br /><br />Update: The problem has now been fixed and works great! Thanks!
1401223176|5.0|Batman: Hush tells a story spanning a hundred pages and tens of villains. Even knowing the backstory from other media, Hush still provided an excellent story that kept me constantly guessing and refusing to put it down. You will not be disappointed.
B002LVVCQM|5.0|Dawkins is one of the scientists who takes the creationists and fundamental christians deniers of evolution on and I think this is necessary since many people in the world are moving back in time to an era when religion was the prime mover for education.  He takes on many of the criticisms of evolution and I think blows them out of the water.<br />Too many schools in the USA and some in Canada back out of the science of evolution.  We have become too politically correct with regard to science education.<br /><br />Good book easy to read and should be on the reading list for all high school students and parents too.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|this would be a fun game if the damn thing didn't shut down simply by breathing on it...  these joy bits people should be ashamed for releasing an app with such terrible quality control.  great idea--abhorent execution
B004HWT6DO|1.0|First, I'm 23, not some old prude lashing out at Facebook because I do not relate to it.<br /><br />Everybody was telling me to watch this movie. I even had a friend compare me to Mark Zuckerberg and while initially flattered, I never felt more insulted after watching this. He's selfish, greedy, and morally bankrupt. He backstabs and takes pride in his insecurity like all hostile nerds do. He objectifies women, capitalizes on hurting people, and delights in humiliating others. He's a tool and a jack***. What's more disturbing is this movie is glorifying it as people come out of the theater talking about how brilliant instead of disgusting Mark is. But I guess that is the status quo. Nobody cares anymore. Narcissism is cool. It's all about \\"self\\" and the \\"I do what I want!\\" attitude.<br /><br />I consider deleting my Facebook at times after seeing this; just can't bring myself to do it as I would lose contact with people abroad. Nobody emails or calls anymore.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|love this game so far no problems clicking on items hope to see more hidden object games in the near future
0142000671|5.0|This book is short, but man it packs a touching message. I had to read it for a class and analyze everything about it and it really is a touching story if you put everything together. The ending completely surprised me, and I can see why George decided to do that. It left me crying for both George and Lennie for everything they had been through. I will never forget this book and will continue reading it throughout the years. Lennie may have been dumb but he was still smart in his own special ways.
0756407125|5.0|I love Patrick Rothfuss and his works so I had to get this book. Be warned, the book is large and heavy. The paperback is the same size as the hardcover, but I would assume a little lighter ( I only ordered the paperback). The pages are of nice quality though.
B006C1DH92|5.0|this is a favorite game for everyone in our home I (mom) love it to kill time for myself and for my kids my 10 yr old,  4 yr old and 2 yr old can't get enough and it's fun to try to beat each others scores
0399226907|5.0|Love to read this one with my granddaughter. She's at the age where I read a page and then she 'reads' it after me. We read this one about 20 times one Friday evening recently. She never gets tired of it.
B003F3NDOO|5.0|This is such a good show and the DVD did not disappoint.  The service was great and it arrived before the specified date to arrive.  I was very pleased with everything.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|First off am I the only one who finds the concept of pretending to be God highly offensive? If I am, I don't care, it's offensive, even if it's \\"just a game\\".<br /><br />I refuse to download this. Other users have said it force closes constantly, which is another reason why this game is useless, but the whole concept is enough for me.<br /><br />No thanks.
B00005V9IL|5.0|Great price for a great movie from the past. I love underwater shows, and this one is a great addition to my collection.
006197806X|5.0|If you haven't read DELIRIUM, get your hands on it now - and then pick up PANDEMONIUM! Lauren Oliver is a master storyteller.<br /><br />Oh Lauren!<br /><br />Lauren, Lauren, Lauren. Seriously, you are the master of endings! You left me screaming \\"why, why, why!!!\\" and running for tissue at the end of DELIRIUM - and now with PANDEMONIUM you have me so lassoed in, that time is gonna feel like it's standing still until I can find out what happens in BOOK 3!<br /><br />Okay, now that I got that out of the way, more on PANDEMONIUM - Once again Lauren proves she's a brilliant writer/storyteller. Her words are often lyrical, drawing the reader into the story. We're treated to a clear description of The Wilds, (THEN) learning how incredibly brutal life on the outside can be. And then in the next chapter the reader finds out what Lena's dealing with in the present (NOW) in New York. But don't expect things to be what they are in our world - Lauren creates a very different and futuristic NYC with recognizable landmarks.<br />Instead of wielding a sword, Lauren wields a brutal pen - no holds barred. It only made me read faster because I had to know what was going to happen next. I often felt a little breathless.<br />The last book REQUIEM comes out in 2013.
B004BLTNM0|5.0|this move is a must watch it is very good so sad how they treated the lady but best believe she got pay back
B004T2QZL8|2.0|I used to love this game on my ipod touch, so I was excited to see it free in amazon. The game, however, is almost unplayable due to the fact that it force closes when I open it! So disappointed to find this out.
B000FQ4M58|5.0|This CD has been on my radar ever since it first was released.  I listened to the song samples, I would pick up the CD and look at it when I went to Walmart.  Honestly, from the song samples I heard I wasn't impressed and the fact that it was not completely written by Jim Steinmen kind of scared me away. Well, this past weekend I bit the bullet and purchased the album after having \\"Cry Over Me\\" stuck in my head for a couple days.  This album is amazing!  I loved the original Bat, and the second was pretty good too, but Bat 3 in my opinion, rivals the first one.  I love each and every song.  Buy it!  You won't be sorry!
B007KQ6XYY|1.0|you will love this game. It is like the first one but cooler. I have played this game before trust me its cool.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|helped me get back into the word. east to understand, follow and read. I would recommend to readers of all ages
B004T2QZL8|4.0|this game is so fun but forces closed all the time. please fix this. I love the game though very intricate and well designed
B006ON41FC|4.0|My first impression of this game was a good one. Good graphics and fun goals make for a very addictive game. My only complaint is that I've run out of goals!
B006JJBFK0|5.0|I am very pleased to see all the 5-star reviews for this album.  I truly feel that it deserves all the praise it's getting. If you are a fan of the symphonic/gothic metal genre, you really should check this album out. Even if you're not a fan of Xandria's past work, please just give Neverworld's End a listen, I can almost guarantee you will not be disappointed. As other reviewers have said, this album is quite similar to Tarja-era Nightwish, so if you liked that style at all you will most likely love Neverworld's End. They took on that style, made it their own, and did it extremely well I must say.

B0059XTUB8|5.0|Marilyn Monroe was every boy's (boys of a certain time period) fantasy girlfriend. She was my first idea of what a woman should be and my naïve, adolescent idea of what sex was about. Marilyn was a little girl lost that every man she came into contact with wanted to save, and the different facets of personality continue to fascinate today, as evidenced in \\"My Week with Marilyn\\".<br /><br />\\"My Week with Marilyn\\" recounts a fairly well known moment in Monroe's life when she went  to England to star in \\"The Prince and the Showgirl\\" with Laurence Olivier. All accounts of the episode stress that it was a horrible pairing, Olivier in his work ethic as an actor and his craft which clashed with Monroe's insecurities and self-doubt about her acting abilities starting taking over her personality, as well as prescription drugs, which made Monroe late or a no-show for many days of shooting, or her trying to apply \\"the method\\" to her acting, all of which caused friction and down right loathing between the two. The story is told from the perspective of twenty-three year Colin Clark, who was a third assistant director in Olivier's production company, which essentially made him a gofer. But because Monroe took a liking to Clark he was one of the few people who Monroe would deal with and respond positively to, and they had a brief affair. The movie highlights the clash between the insecurities of Monroe and her acting abilities, and Olivier's insecurities about aging, with Colin caught in the middle and trying to appease both Olivier and Monroe.<br /><br />Williams doesn't have most of Monroe's sexual charisma or most of Monroe's voluptuous attributes, what Williams has right is Monroe's look and the fragile vulnerability of the real Monroe (if there could be such a thing, Marilyn Monroe was the public persona of Norma Jean Baker, a kind of sexual Frankenstein's monster that got away from Baker but ultimately consumed her), and Williams lets that vulnerability show through the sex goddess persona as well. Eddie Redmayne as Colin Clark has the right eager naïf-like quality for the role as the credulous liaison between Olivier and Monroe.  Kenneth Branagh disappears into his role as Olivier and although Branagh doesn't resemble Olivier he captures the nuances of Olivier from aging star to frustrated director trying to get a performance out of Monroe. There are also some very nice supporting roles, Emma Watson as a costume designer at the studio who Colin likes and who suddenly finds herself vying for his attentions against the greatest sex symbol of the 20th century. Dame Judi Dench has a nice turn as an aging actress who supports Monroe, and Julia Ormond as Vivien Leigh married to Olivier, not trusting his relationship to Monroe, foreshadowing the problems that would come later in her life.<br /><br />While Monroe is an icon that still fascinates us to this day, maybe just that iconography may be sifting down to us. My sister watched the movie and thought it a bit boring, so this movie may be for people of a certain age, I hope not, I found it a well acted and interesting vignette into Olivier's and Monroe's life. If we don't remember the person behind the icon than we truly have hollow idols and lost the person behind them.<br /><br />The bonus section has a nice making of the feature that lends insights into the principles both past and present as well as background material to the period. There's also a directors commentary.goddess persona as well. Eddie Redmayne as Colin Clark has the right eager naïf-like quality for the role as the credulous liaison between Olivier and Monroe.

0553386794|5.0|This book, the first in the Game of Thrones series was highly entertaining. I had trouble putting it down throughout the entire time I read it. However, the book is incredibly sad throughout the entire thing. The attachment I felt toward most of the characters was quite deep, which impressed me. This quickly became a conflict with myself, as multiple characters which I had become incredibly attached to were on opposite sides of conflicts, and it became difficult to decide which side I wanted to be the victor. However this is more of an achievement for the book, rather than a flaw, as making characters that are easy to attach to is what makes the book such a good read. The ending was also quite intriguing, and made me want to read the second. I found no point in the book that I felt it was slow, due to a lack of action or interesting plot. I would recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of the fantasy and historical fiction. It is definitely a worthy read, even for its length.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really enjoy the variety of different games and especially that more unlock as you go along, it seems to keep things fresh longer. I was pretty surprised it was a free app. It's certainly worth any space it occupies.
0061537969|5.0|Excellent book. I love comparing car racing to the twists and turns of life. You don't have to be a NASCAR fan or a dog lover to love this book.
B0039ZF8D2|5.0|Both of these artists are true lyrical masters in their respective genres. This album lacks the image facade and hits home with thought provoking content. In this era of digital downloads and the loss of the album concept, it is great to have an upbeat album that one can play from beginning till end.
B005DKLPQ0|5.0|This CD box set is a thing of beauty. It was lovingly put together and the mini-LP replica style packaging looks gorgeous and stylish.<br /><br />But how is the sound? A lot of attention was put into making these remasters sound as natural, clear, and detailed as possible and the results are, for the most part, riveting. While these remasters are a bit louder, they're not excessively so: they're definitely not brickwalled, distorted, or victims of over-compression.<br /><br />The debut: of the 8 remasters included here, this one offers the most audibly noticeable improvement. The debut has long suffered from timid, brittle, gutless sound, which dragged down an otherwise incredible album. This remaster has remedied that. The sound of this album will always be on the bright side (that's just how it was recorded), but this remaster improves the sound in a very noticeable way. It now sounds fuller, livelier, punchier, and much more detailed. This remaster is now my go-to version. Purists may cry foul at the inclusion of \\"This Charming Man\\" (replicating the US tracking order, as opposed to the original UK), but who cares, it's a great song. What's important is that we're finally hearing this album the way it was intended to be heard, and this one sounds better than all the other versions out there.<br /><br />Hatful of Hollow: the original UK/Rough Trade pressing of this album already sounded perfect, and in this case, the remaster misses the mark. The BBC recordings are the most aversely affected by this, suffering from excessive low frequency boost, giving the songs a bassy, throbbing, rumbly sound that detracts from Johnny Marr's detailed guitar work. The studio recordings sound fine, but the excessive low-end that plagues the BBC recordings makes this pressing inferior to the original Rough Trade.<br /><br />Meat is Murder: this one originally had a slightly muddy sound. The remaster is not as revelatory as that of the debut, but it's a slight improvement - a littlemore detail, a bit more fullness, but nothing significant. Most listeners probably wouldn't hear much difference between this and the original UK Rough Trade pressing, except that this one is a little bit louder. Nevertheless, it sounds wonderful.<br /><br />The Queen is Dead: I'm a bit less enamored with this remaster, and like Hatful of Hollow, may actually prefer the original Rough Trade if only because there are times when the remaster sounds a tad too aggressive - the one instance where they might've goosed the compression a bit too much (although relatively speaking, it's not terrible by any  means).<br /><br />Louder than Bombs: again, this remaster betters the original flawed pressing. For example, on the original Sire version, \\"Shoplifters\\" sounds like it was mastered from a copy that was a few generations removed from the original; fluttery cymbals and a layer of murk. But on the remaster, \\"Shoplifters\\" sounds crisp and clear - much closer to the 12\\". The same can be said for \\"Panic.\\" This will probably be my go-to version from now on.<br /><br />Strangeways: the US Sire pressing of this album always sounded bad (fluttery, loss of clarity/detail, etc.), but the original UK Rough Trade is perfect (silky, detailed, full). This remaster is about neck and neck with the original Rough Trade, which is fine since the Rough Trade didn't need improving in the first place.<br /><br />As for The World Won't Listen and Rank, I seldom listen to those albums in the first place, and can't really offer a meaningful comparison between these remasters and the originals.<br /><br />Also, I realize the intent with this box set was merely to deliver remastered pressings of the original albums and compilations, but I think it's a bit unfortunate that they didn't include a bonus CD compiling all of the b-sides that weren't included on these albums. For example, excellent songs like \\"Wonderful Woman,\\" and \\"Money Changes Everything,\\" and various Peel Sessions and live versions, like \\"Nowhere Fast\\" and \\"Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others,\\" can be found on the super deluxe box set, but aren't included here. Why shouldn't people who only want the CD box set be deprived of such wonderful songs? The \\"Complete\\" title is a bit misleading in this case.<br /><br />Finally, for those complaining about the overlap in songs between the three compilations - you're COMPLETELY missing the point! The intent was to remaster and re-release all of the studio, live, and compilation albums that were originally released in the 80s. In doing so, they are catering to the hardcore fans who had to have *everything*, regardless of overlap. They are also appealing to fans' sense of nostalgia. There are many of us who discovered the Smiths through comps like Louder or Hatful, and they hold a very profound and special place, not just in our music collections, but our lives! Marr et al. simply wanted fans to be able to re-experience these comps in their full, remastered glory. Is that so wrong?
B004EBT5CU|1.0|Awful cover of The Cure's \\"Lovesong\\". Shame on you. >< We all know that The Cure's \\"Lovesong\\" is a great song, but I wish that people would stop covering it. It is best AS IS.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This is a pretty cool game. A good choice if you are looking for a simple yet engaging game. Also, a wonderful time sink game.

B006P0FD4W|3.0|Ok movie
B004T2QZL8|1.0|Just like the title says...was enjoying this, now it FC all the time...completely unplayable now....please fix!  Google Play's version was rolled back becauseof the issues.  Once updated I'll change the rating.

B004I1WIWU|5.0|Not going to repeat the review of the music, which is beautiful.<br /><br />I purchased this 3/19/2012 evening, received it the next day via UPS (Prime member).  Excellent packaging.  Disc is heavy-duty, high quality; perhaps 180 or 200 gram, audiophile-quality pressing.  Included was a coupon with a digital download code, which worked, so I now have the vinyl, mp3's on my Macbook (added to iTunes library), and burnt a CD for car use.  Super product.
B0069UP2PI|3.0|I was particularly drawn to this movie by the stellar cast lineup. Kate Winslet, in particular, rarely appears in a poor movie.<br /><br />This is a good thriller, capturing the fear that can quickly spread globally when a virus unleashes itself on the world. There's good suspense and action, however, there's a lack of quality character development which lets the movie down. This is an inevitable consequence of having too many stars in a 100+ minute movie.<br /><br />I actually preferred the 1995 movie \\"Outbreak\\" starring Dustin Hoffman and Rene Russo and would recommend this to anyone who particularly enjoys these types of thrillers.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Contagion\\" is very watchable and worth a night in in front of the screen.
0439023513|1.0|Even the most unsophisticated of readers should have been totally frustrated by it. Heroes/protagonists of books (and movies) are supposed to be active and move the story forward, taking their destiny into their own hands. Katniss is not this type of person and the story should not have been told from her point of  view. Everything happens to her, around her, without her. That is not the only cardinal rule that is broken, but to give more details would give away the book to those who still want to suffer through reading.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a wonderful game, addictive, and it helps with scrabble words when I'm stuck! Keep it up! five gold stars!!! for me already ;)
B002MQYOFW|2.0|I can understand why preteen girls might like this first book. But when I read that an English teacher was basing an entire semester around these books, I was flummoxed. This is not literature, especially book 3. Speaking as an English teacher, I would allow students to read this for an outside reading assignment, However, in class, I would provide examples of higher level lit. All that aside, the main character Katniss drove me crazy. She is not likable, she is clueless, and really I was not at all emotionally invested in her. Spoiler alert: this is the best of the three. She should have left it here; a tidy ending that resolves the main conflict of the novel and leaves the rest to the reader's imagination.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|love it helpful, for math purposes. Steve wolfram is a genius definitely appeals to the physicists out there. thank you sir steve

B004T2QZL8|2.0|I loved the game but the forced closed notifications kept me from rateing it above a two star of course. where amazon to say repair it I might rate it much higher than what I did so unless you only want to play a game for ten minutes then don't buy this app

B004T2QZL8|4.0|I loved this game on my iphone and know it is on my fire.  works great, but the game speed is a little fast.  hence four stars instead of five.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|Fun for 30 minutes then the game force closes. I dont understand why it does this... I have an atrix and every other game works great. would be a great game but not worth the time because of this flaw.
0143038095|5.0|This is the first book I ever remember having an emotional connection with.  I cried as these women endured loss after loss.  I haven't read it in several years but will do so again soon.
0553801473|1.0|It's not like another review is needed for this book (as of writing, there are over 1700 reviews), but I just had to put in my two cents.  I absolutely loved the first 3 books of the ASOIAF series.  They were some of the best books I have ever read.  A Feast for Crows was very disappointing, but I fully expected Martin to get back on track with this book.  I couldn't have been more wrong.<br /><br />I don't really need to go in to detail about what is wrong with this book, but it appears that Martin just doesn't enjoy writing this series anymore.  He has said so himself many times on his blog and in interviews that this book was a pain to write.  He makes millions of dollars from these books that we the fans pay over 20 dollars each for, and he is making it sound like he has the hardest job in the world.<br /><br />I'll list the problems with this book:  no advancement in major plotlines, overuse of \\"cliffhangers\\", no climactic scenes such as large battles or interesting things happening.<br /><br />Now that his books are being made into a TV series on HBO, it's evident he cares more about being a writer/producer for the TV series than actually writing the next book.  Speaking of that, when will he finish the next book?  2018?  If we are lucky.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|My girlfriend posted this on facebook and I loved it so much I had to have it. I listen to it all the time. It arrived on time and perfect condition.

B004T2QZL8|3.0|this game was fun until it started force closing. if they can get it patched then I would recommend it to others.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The author assembles a story line that is believable, but overemphasizes the more obscure &#34;murder gene&#34; element at the expense of development of the more relatable themes and characters in the book.  When the only child of a DA is accused of murder, the story chronicles the compassionate (albeit blind) defense of the 14 year old boy by his father, inside and outside of the courtroom.  The simultaneously random yet predictable plot highlights the disconnect between parents and children, while also revealing the societal escapism provided by social media that furthers the disconnect within the family.  Those elements hit home to anyone who is a parent.<br /><br />The author continues on a legal drama vector through the mind and heart of the father in believable denial, but there are too many underveloped elements woven into the story that left me wondering why they werent explored more deeply.  There is little doubt where the story is headed for most of the book, with the climax being, unfortunately, anything but.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it. its on of the best games on here I hope its on here forever. but I do wish their were more games.
B000I3SYEI|2.0|The blu ray transfer was not as good as I expected. I couldn't really tell any difference from the standard dvd. Also it is the shorter version of the movie, not the director's cut. This is arguably the best STAR TREK movie and really should've been given a stellar upgrade.

For years I would neglect them thinking they're all the same. boring.<br />Boy I was SO wrong.<br />Thank you Suzanne Collins for opening my eyes on the world of books.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This was an excellent read.  It was recommended to me by a high school student teacher, and I enjoyed every single page of the entire trilogy.  Suzanne Collins develops believable characters and tells a spellbinding story.  Our book club is currently reading it.

B004UID2LC|5.0|this app has helped me do my schoolwork and for my own entertainment and joy. I am extremely pleased with this youtube downloading application.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I am glad I gave this trilogy a shot.  Normally; anything BDSM (related) wouldn't interest me.  I heard about it on television during a shot news snippet.  The group of news-people snickered about it being 'Mommy-Porn'.  I didn't like that term when they said it and yet it got me wondering what the hoopla was about.<br /><br />The first book pretty much hooked me in spite of it being written in the first person.  I prefer third-person reading for fiction.  Still: I gave it a shot.<br /><br />Christian Grey is a very intriguing person.  Why was this guy so dark and `damaged'?  I had to keep reading to find out.  Then there is Ana and I was curious as to why she was so patient with a man like Christian.  With every crisis in their relationship there is another clue as to why Christian has come to this place that rules his world; his very thinking.  Through every up and down on the roller-coaster they experience together, Ana seems to dig in a bit deeper as if she's gearing up for the ride of her life.  She commits herself to a loving relationship; even as Christian finds ways to master her further.  It's quite a battle as times!  Yet; the relationship grows and thrives.  Ana isn't one to be mastered, either.  She tests the limits of Christian's endurance, and patience.  Slowly; Christian learns to compromise.  More slowly; he learns to trust.  He also learns to to love.  The contract he'd have her sign becomes the one thing that makes Ana different for him because in the end having that signed agreement is something he realizes he doesn't need anymore - not with her.  Ana (in her innocence) is a 'clean-slate' in terms of sex and Christian manages - very-slowly - to learn something he'd yet to learn about sex.  In effect: Ana teaches Christian.  All Christian knew before was pain, humiliation, and reward; something he felt was normal for himself and his contracted-partners.  Christian's journey during the three books is quite a process.<br /><br />The first book sets them on their paths and then tears them apart.<br /><br />The second book reunites them in a love neither saw coming.<br /><br />The third book carries them forward in a mine-field of missing stepping-stones.  They progress along; just barely.  The ending is a reward to the characters and us readers.  Don't read the ending first!  Why spoil the meal by drinking your after-dinner-wine first?<br /><br />The books have a certain degree of intrigue and danger; both kept me interested along with the mystery of Christian's past as it unfolds slowly.  Ana was simply what she was: a good solid character without pretense and a lot of strength of will and curiosity.  Both characters were very interesting alone and put together: combustible.<br /><br />I'm glad I gave this series my time.  It is worthy of any praise I give it.  It kept me submerged in mystery and a certain amount of angst (on my part).  The books made me think.  They made me FEEL.  I'm grateful for them.  Thank you Dear Authoress for sharing them with us readers.<br /><br />NOTE: the only two things I'd mention that I thought over the top in the series: too many UK-type-terms left in and my thinking here is that if you want to write an American based novel, you have to leave out anything an American wouldn't say....like 'Arse' (this is just one example and there were many).  The other thing is Ana gave WAY too much thought to her 'inner goddess' and it became repetitive and boring.hem on their paths and then tears them apart.<br /><br />The second book reunites them in a love neither saw coming.<br /><br />The third book carries them forward in a mine-field of missing stepping-stones.

B0063IH60K|5.0|This app works very well on the kindle fire. Challenging yet fun and its free! Really cant get better than that.

B004T2QZL8|1.0|You can play for a little bit and I'm excited to see what the other &quot;episodes&quot; include, however when the force closes start, its impossible to play or enjoy. My guess is either Amazon or the developer won't update, but if they did this seems like it would be a fun game.
B0073PZN8O|3.0|I think the movie has a very good concept and the store, but they could have done so much more with it.<br />It is just an OKAY movie.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|the game itself is awesome and addicting, unfortunately it keeps force closing x_x BUT its worth downloading for free now and waiting for the update to fix it later
B007JRU2UK|3.0|This movie is competently done, with all the requisite parts intact. The rebellious daughter, the cute daughter, the crusty father in law, the harried male protagonist trying to be a father for the first time. They're all in there.<br /><br />The script has all the right pieces in the right order. The storytelling uses voice-over, which I consider a weak device. I identified with all the characters without actually being able to get under their skin. It's a decent script but I wouldn't put it anything other than just slightly above average. I don't see how this script got the Oscar.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I always look forward to a new Nicholas Sparks book, and Safe Haven was everything I expected.  Great combination of love story, and thriller.  I would highly recommend. Can't wait for his next book to be published.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|FYI, This is the lead singer from the band \\"The Format\\" from ASU.  They were awesome, especially their first album \\"Interventions & Lullabies\\".  The second album, \\"Dog Problems\\", was leaning toward a much more pop-heavy feel to it so I'm not surprised that these new albums represent the direction the lead singer headed after their breakup in 2008.  If you're looking for more pop-influenced work be sure to check out Dog Problems...if you'd like to hear this singer's voice in a more mellow, acoustic indy-pop setting check out the first album by the Format.<br />Pretty solid album the whole way through...having a listen to their first album now and enjoying that too.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|All kinky stuff aside, I dare you not to fall in love with Christian Grey! This is one of those series that you just can't put down.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The Positive:<br />This book incorporates a number of tropes from a number of very interesting previous works.  The game feels an awful lot like The Truman Show in its production and distribution.  Shirley Jackson's short story \\"The Lottery\\" seems to have inspired the selection process.  While this may seem a negative, it shows an ability for Collins to take used tropes and reinvent them for her own purposes.  The descriptive language is not overwrought and for the most part she avoids awkward societal elements that would come across as unbelievable.  It is daring in it's presentation of violence acted out by and acted upon adolescents.<br /><br />The Negative:<br />The first, and perhaps the biggest flaw of this work, is that the daring presentation of violence acted out by and acted upon adolescents seems to lend itself more toward playing up the romantic aspects of the novel rather than focusing on the delivery of a deeper theme.  Though the main character talks much about the psychological and emotional aspects to the flawed societal construct, the author misses the opportunity to make the story a true commentary on human nature, and rather makes the story a commentary on the confused notions of adolescent romantic notions.  The book begins to bear a disturbing resemblance to Survivor, or Big Brother.  There are times when the story telegraphs too clearly coming plot twists.  There are changes in the game that feel like soft plot manipulation and the end of the story does an emotional hairpin turn that fails to provide a sense of cohesion between the ending of the story and the vast majority of its plot line.<br /><br />In Closing:<br />A worth-while read with some minor flaws.  I'm looking forward to reading the next two in the series.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|it keeps force closing on my kindle fire and I like this game my sister has no problem with it
B005GFPZYK|3.0|I shoot long range tactical and found this book to have very little detail about what the author saw during his tours.  He would say he shot two or three insurgents in an area one day then the next day he would shoot some more in another area.  There were no details about what he saw through his scope.  No details about what DOPE he used, sitting in his hide, etc...  DETAILS, someone with this much combat experience should have some great stories but they were not relayed in this book. I may have missed it but never saw how many kills he accumulated. I am thankful for his service though.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|there is an updated version available! the force close is all fixed.  the game is awesome so far.  I. have been playing for more than 2 hours with no closes.
B0064NTZJO|3.0|This movie was actually nothing like I had imagined.  I feel as though the director and producer attempted to model this movie after Taxi and Transporter, with a slight twist of Pulp Fiction.  The story line was weak, and the events played out incredibly slow.  Indeed the film looks good in Blu-ray, but I am disappointed that I paid for the \\"privilege\\" of viewing.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I found myself in a reflective mood lately recalling all the people,and artists<br />of differing venues,and whenever we are in these moods of course many are<br />forgotten(perhaps they shouldnt be) and we recall those who have left some<br />remebrance a time of your life,a person you were with,family life or maybe<br />a fixation on a celebrity for some reason...there are all kinds of reasons. Let me just add fixations on celebrities are ok as long as there are many celebrities,and we are just enthusing at various and divergent artists,that's ok and something we should try to emulate. No star in the past around my area,not madonna or whomever had so much exposure,or overexposure as Brit,in media personal life,posters within malls and stores,news articles...news i say. Why i dont know anyone better..or more of anyone's life. So i saw an interview recently in which she stated not realistically,she may give up on singing soon of course I dont think she means it. So i recalled her songs and singing. Now when we pick up her cd,and the latest when i recently purchased at the store,right away an image of the artist circulates throughout our minds. Its infection is seen throughout the cd \\"piece of me\\" \\"gimme more\\"...and all kinds of ways her image has radiated(one song is radar and a sensual like heaven<br />on earth) and what do we make of hot as ice? These may all be reflections on<br />her own image,romancing,or our thoughts of this very photogenic singer. I just<br />say this in a teasing way...the sultriness and teasing string in her voice<br />finds no equal,and it makes the cd and all songs fun and alluring,since if you<br />dont like one particular song there's the voice...and i have not heard a better<br />or sexy voice as i recall her voice again after many years. Sinatra had a quality where everyone thought he was singing just to them...one song may not be yours their's always singer and voice. That quality..and voice..I always liked about her ...Toy soldier is a reflection on weightier matters and a song which puts imagery in perspective. I hope she's around much longer...I do recall all those news articles about her and family and talks around the breakfast table that person is gone..but the cd and this voice still surrounds my mind..Good stuff i'll listen to more..the change in hair color on this cd i like she's more appealing in balck hair!Isn't everyone!!
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I am a very heavy sleeper who has difficulty getting up in the morning. I have tried almost everything imaginable to get myself to wake up early in the morning. This app wakes me up quickly and easily. The ability to solve difficult math problems forces you to wake up to shut the alarm off and the app wakes you gently so you aren't so jarred when you hear the alarm. This app allows me to wake up hours before school to get extra homework done when I would have normally been asleep.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give this app 5/5 is not a problem with the app itself but my device. I am using a kindle fire and its speakers seem very quiet. I luckily have a small set of old desktop computer speakers that i hooked my kindle up to. This was a simple, cheap fix and it made my kindle much louder. I'm not sure how confident I would be waking up to this app on my kindle alone just because it is a quieter device.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|It's really a very fun game until it starts crashing on you. I wish amazon would update the older but more stable version of this otherwise highly entertaining and fun game. Can't wait to play more of it, without it crashing on me of course.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|this was even more enjoyable than grisly manor,nice gfx, left me wanting more as usual, and well worth the price paid.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I just got this game and ive already unlocked 10 games!! It so kook and easy to play!! I love it!!!
B004T2QZL8|3.0|The game is fun, makes you think. I've tried on 2 different handsets, motorola photon and lg spectrum, force closes constantly. I enjoy the game, but the force closes make it impossible to play.
0375869026|5.0|I continue to be amazed by this book. There are no words that can express my feelings about Auggie. What an amazing job the author has done to bring to life such a beautiful spirit in an imperfect package. I found myself thinking about my reactions to, and interactions with, children/adults with facial imperfections over my life, though admittedly, I don't think I've ever encountered someone with Auggie's deformity level. I cannot remember specifics, but I would certainly hope I've never offended anyone with obvious discomfort or too evident pity.<br /><br />Wonder should be required reading for teachers, any child (3rd grade up), and teens attending public school, where they are more likely to encounter non-cookie-cutter children. I would certainly encourage adults to read this as well, though those without children or the public school experience may not be as impacted.<br /><br />I hope this is just the first of many, many books from this young lady.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I really like it!!!@ home I play it all the time.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!hi have a nice day!?!? do u have games.<br />I
B004T2QZL8|5.0|it just force closes...  :(  other than that, it's brilliant. thanks 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
B0034G4ORC|1.0|The movie did not play. When I contacted goHastings, they said they cannot replace it because more than 30 days passed. I thought they stood by their products. I was wrong. I will look for other retailers next time.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|The app is fun at first, but after discovering a couple of elements the app just force closes all the time.
0545265355|4.0|This is a very different story from anything i have ever read. i enjoyed the first book a lot and am starting the 2nd today!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Low quality graphics even on high end phones, starting from scratch for the second time as it ate my saves again. Sad it should be a great game.
B005LLSLPE|5.0|Upon receiving a Netflix subscription for the Holidays, we stumbled upon the series Sons of Anarchy.  We marathoned the first three seasons and were disappointed to know the 4th season ended in December.  We went to quite a few stores only to find out that the DVD has not yet been released for season 4.  We did some research and found it on your site.  We have now finished season 4 and can't wait until season 5 begins in the fall.  Thanks for having it readily available.
B0063GORYU|3.0|I really like spider. Sometimes I get stuck and it's a challenge to get out of the game without just quitting. lol. I even get my sister into the game and she's hooked. :)
B004T2QZL8|1.0|like reviews, this app worked well for ten or fifteen minutes on my fire. then it started force closing everytime I tried to combine two elements. if they could fix this bug, then this app would be great. till then its just worthless.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|Made it to 32 before it force closes every time I try to match any thing. Was cool until that point.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|so it's a good game but keeps having to force close on my kindle fire when they update it it will be the best game on my kindle.
B0059XTUMC|4.0|***This review may contain spoilers.***<br /><br />The mystery suggested in the title above permeates this absorbing, black-and-white, largely silent movie from the onset, when we witness late 1920s' silent movie star George Valentin (Jean Dujardin), in his latest action epic, attached to some kind of electrical torture device operated by Russian spy operatives.  They urge him to \\"Speak\\", but he refuses.  And why should he speak?  The public zealously adores this handsome, suave, slightly egotistical ham and his faithful, ubiquitous, fox terrier Jack (Uggie) - except maybe his resentful, neglected wife Doris (Penelope Ann Miller).  The fans mob him, especially persistent, winsome ingenue Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo).  George is king of the Hollywood silents, until Hollywood becomes enamored of sound.  A matinee idol like George should have no trouble transitioning to talkies, right?  But he stubbornly resists.  Is it his uncompromising artistic sense, or something more latent?<br /><br />This \\"vow of silence\\" mystery enhances \\"The Artist\\".  As the movie examines the incremental emotional, financial, and marital toll exacted by George's obstinacy, we are entertained and engrossed, even though anyone with even a passing familiarity with the antediluvian plottings of \\"A Star is Born\\" and \\"Citizen Kane\\" can more or less predict the stages of George's fall.  Doris leaves him; his self-financed silent film bombs; he can no longer retain his chauffeur Clifton (James Cromwell); his studio boss Al Zimmer (John Goodman) dismisses him as washed up unless he hops on the talkie train.  Most galling of all, Peppy rises through the talkie ranks to become a famous actress (due in part to the fake mole George playfully draws on her right cheek).  The audience forsakes George for Peppy.  He loses his home and possessions. He drinks.  He burns his library of movie reels (except one).  Even the outside world (e.g. the \\"Lonely Star\\" marquee and the quicksand scene of his silent flop) seems to mock him.  George thinks of ending it all.  Many of you have seen this before, even as \\"The Artist\\" makes its simultaneously adoring and satirical overview of late 20's Hollywood, the transience and superficiality of fame, and the importance of true, loyal friends entertaining.<br /><br />However, we stick with George because we mentally exhort him to swallow his pride and artistic ethics, and give the talkies a whirl.  Jack saves George's life from the fire he started.  Clifton reluctantly leaves George's employ, but returns as Peppy's chauffeur.  A grateful Peppy never forgets George's initial support on the way to the top, and even drives frantically (and badly) through the Hollywood streets to prevent George's suicide.  She may even have a solution to George's dilemma...<br /><br />\\"The Artist\\" gives a clue to George's mystery toward the end, when we finally hear George speak.  Then, I think, the answer becomes clear, especially if the phrase \\"ethnic discrimination\\" comes to mind.ems to mock him.  George thinks of ending it all.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is so much fun I play it all the time! But some of the games are hard it is still ally of fun! :)
B0053B347M|5.0|I bought these to light the back of an LCD TV I have on a adjustable wall mount (see customer attached images).  They are light and not too bright, I bought 4 of them but only ended up useing 3. You can't really tell they are on during the day, but by dusk they produce the intended effect.<br /><br />As far as installation, I have the section where the strip meets the USB cable supported with a small strip of duct tape to relieve some strain on the ahesive of the light strip itself. Some additional zip ties keep the cables routed to a [[ASIN:B000Q8UAWY Belkin USB 2.0 4-Port Ultra-Mini Hub]]. Hub is then connected to a USB port on the TV to power up and down with the TV. Doesn't look pretty on the back, but I'm not really looking at the back of my TV too much.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|I ignored the other reviews who had force close problems. Sometimes what force close on one phone does ok on others. We can add my Razor Max to the list.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Best season so far!! I have watched all episodes from the beginning and this one made me want season 5 to hurry up and come out. You just never know what they will do next!
0307887898|2.0|I was anxious to read this book to gain some insight into applying the techniques of lean into my startup business.  With a greenbelt and a couple LSS projects in my background I've been excited to take the techniques I learned when I was an employee and apply them to my own business.  Disappointingly, this book was not very helpful in doing what I wanted.  The author never gets down to the essential facts, or if he does, they are so wrapped in excess words that I couldn't distill them.  My first read through the book turned into a skimming because I couldn't bear reading case study after case study with so much extra stuff that wasn't giving me insight into what to do.  I decided to give it a second go and read it again, taking notes along the way, to try and pull out the important facts.  The author seems to have devised his own set of terms, which I was fine with, until it dawned on me that the \\"minimum viable product\\" the author describes sounded a lot like a LSS pilot project.  That got me wondering about what other Lean Startup concepts were simply LSS terms repackaged.  The whole concept of \\"innovation accounting\\" never became clear to me, in fact while I was taking notes it started to seem like a circular argument was being made concerning the what and why of innovation accounting.  I again started to quickly pass through the remainder of the book since I didn't see how I was going apply any rigorous, systematic processes since nothing was ever clearly laid out.<br /><br />The author's mentioning of the idea of getting started and learning quickly along the way was helpful for allowing me to see what I am doing with my business and accept that it is an ok way to operate.  Unfortunately, after two readings I don't have much to take away and apply to my business.
0553801473|5.0|As with the rest of the series this is an amazing book. I Love it!!! I would recommend thos series of book to everyone andI have.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|When you see it, you can't believe this is a movie from the 90s. Incredible the HD conversion! Well done interactiv menus, many extras, BDLive, a great edition for Terminator's fans. Different options on languages and subtitles too.
B0017I1IZA|5.0|Ranger, Joe -who do you root on to win Stephanie over? Some days I don't know which one I am routing for myself. All in all I'm routing Stephanie on. In the meantime I'm loving reading more about Stephanie becoming an infamous bounty hunter -ha ha! Evanovich's adding hard not to love characters along the way makes each of these stories more hard to resist than the previous one! Hard Eight does not disappoint.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|Great rendition of this type of game. Sadly though at some point it crashes and it requires a reinstall if the game to make it work again. Unlocked elements don't carry over from this, therefore extremely hard to enjoy.<br />T-Mobile Mytouch 4G
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't know how to give adequate praise to this series of stories. They are polished, profound, original, and hard to put down. I had never heard of Hugh Howey, but after reading this series I feel like I have discovered an author who is easily in the same league as Isaac Asimov. This is a story that has etched itself into my memory and I will probably think about it over and over again for the rest of my life.<br /><br />If you are considering this for your Kindle, get the sample and read the first story. If you like true Science Fiction (the kind that keeps you guessing, that feels like philosophy) then I guarantee you will enjoy this series.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|I got the movie today, and I was surprised by the packaging. There's nothing wrong with it, I just thought that people were smart enough not to use paper  cases anymore. It also freaked me out when I saw the dvd version and it looks like somebody just took a SONY DVD-R and wrote \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" on it with sharpie haha.<br /><br />But other than that, it's a fantastic product.
B0064NTZJO|1.0|Falling in love to<br />an eighties synth-pop montage?<br />Unforgivable.<br />.<br />.<br /><br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />sfasdfa
B0054JZC6E|5.0|20 word minimum? what. well okay. this is probably the most amazing app on the amazon appstore. or atleast one that I found.
B0007ZD6YK|4.0|The product came as scheduled.  I was unable to play the dvds at first because of a region code error.  After a few google searches I was able to find out how to set up my blu-ray player to play any region code. It seems these DVD's are made to only play on players which support the British region code.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|Fun game but force close kills it and I deleted this app...I guess a bug is to.be expected in the Kindle fires free app a day!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Thanks for your work.  I have this app on my phone and kindle.  I recommend it to people all the time.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I loved this book for two reasons: the intensity and the secondary characters.  This is the kind of book that you'd never want to live in real life, but is such a page turner.  The story is very focused on the characters and their intense feelings for each other.  I loved that Abby will not consider a relationship until Travis learns to treat her well! The main couple's best friends are a great add to the story.  Abby's friend is so awesome, she supports her or sets her straight as needed, without being jealous or silly.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|It's been updated and no longer crashes.  I played it all the way through so in that respect I guess it was amusing enough.
B002RL7VKC|5.0|Lego Duplo Legoville Big Tractor (5647)<br /><br />My best friends have a family history of farming, so I thought this gift for their son was a novel idea. They not only got a kick out of it, their boy (almost 2) loves playing with it. When my daughter (almost 3) is over playing with him, they both are so engaged with this and a few other duplo sets (auto repair and fire fighting set). These toys take a beating and look and play just as new.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|Well the first failure in this a app was the force close, afterwards I got annoyed by the running Santa and the things arm wrestling, Then the app mentions something called a &quot;Doodle God&quot; who create elements to shape worlds out of doodle....  Last time I checked the world is Not MADE OUT OF Doodle, so this is misleading to real live concept.... 1 star for making me write a confusing review and forcing me to create hundreds of Doodle worlds out of DOODLE!! :D kkkk.  (Parents beware! Santa is made from Doodle!)
0061733199|5.0|I really enjoy the parts on how to survive in the wild. This is a great book with valuable knowledge on survival.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|this game force closes a lot and I don't know why.  it gets really annoying and game isn't that exciting
B004T2QZL8|1.0|Constantly force closes rendering game unplayable.  Definitely needs an update to fox this issue.  Would be a good game if it worked.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I enjoyed this game on my Iphone, so I decided to get it on my Kindle Fire. It's disappointing. Same issues as everyone else -- crashes. FIXED!!! Now it is an enjoyable time waster.
1451648537|4.0|A thoughtful and comprehensive study of a complex, brilliant and to many of his associates and family members, infuriating man.  It is all here - the good, the bad, and the ugly.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|It was good until it started to force close everytime I wanted to play. It makes me slightly irritated that they didn't check for bugs. I even turned on and off my Kindle Fire, but that didn't help.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|version 1.4.2.3 force closes on my kindle, very disappointing.  If that were fixed it would get a 4 ot 5 star review. Gameplay is fun, but crash is unacceptable.
0545265355|5.0|This item is perfect for The Hunger Games fans who love the series. I also got the Mockingjay pin and the Mockingjay necklace, so I have a perfect pack. I recommend it to you.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|at 35 elements and now it forcecloses every time I select the second element to combine. please fix to change rating. (on EVO 4G)
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This was the first app I got for my kindle fire. I love this game, hours of entertainment. The goals for each set of levels change which keeps the game from getting boring.
B000A2UBN4|5.0|I've watched this movie several times over the years and it has always haunted me. I know it's a remake, but I like much more and the actors just make it so much better. Juliett Lewis and Jessica Lange and beautiful. And De Niel is devious and scarey. A must WATCH!
B004T2QZL8|2.0|Cant even get past the first level of creating elements to see what, the rest of the app is about..
B0002VFXFE|5.0|This worked well for my first build.  The compound didn't come with any instructions, but I was able to obtain them on the company's site, for my particular type of CPU.  I was a bit nervous about tinning my CPU with a credit card, but I got over it after awhile.  They also state that it's important to fill in the grooves on the heat-sink. Mine was already smooth, but with groves to be filled, so that what I did, very carefully and obsessively I might add.<br /><br />I'm now a believer of this compound and their techniques, because I'm getting 19C Idle/28C with regular use on my 4.5 overclocked i5 2500K processor.  I thought I put too much with all the tinning and such, but others have informed me that my temps are really good, some I a believer now.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|I've played the online flash version and had good hopes for it but even on the DROID RAZR I got the force close of doom.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|This game is a lot of fun... if it wouldn't force close all the time it would be worthy of a 5 star rating!  Please fix this!
B004T2QZL8|2.0|Force closes CONSTANTLY after 36 combinations. If it weren't for that I would give 5 stars this game was incredifun at the beginning.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|I adore this game, and have played it on other devices, but the constant crashes on my Fire make it unplayable. Sorry Doodle God, you just don't work.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Best book I have read by Nicholas sparks! I absolutely loved it and excited see movie now!!!! If you picture Zac Efron as the main character it makes the reading much more fun! Very very good book!!!!!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I like the NIV better-- easier to understand.<br />But this is nice, and the way they have it broken down<br />into different books is great!  I would give this a 4 star rating! Many thanks! .
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Another great trilogy! The hunger games was a quick and easy read. I enjoyed every minue of it. It was also slightly terrifying if you get really involved in the story. I fell in love with the characters and even cried my eyes out. I found myself not being able to put the books down. I finished all 3 in 4 days. Excited to see the movies!!
B006SMLAMQ|3.0|I haven't messed with the app to give it a true review, by most reviews I'm reading so far relate to the size if the app.<br /><br />One nice aspect of Android I'd the ability to install apps to the SD card.  As an HTC Desire user, I have no choice but to use this feature, otherwise I would be very limited in my apps I could keep installed.<br /><br />This only takes up 512kb in my phone and even installed directly to the SD card in my experience.<br /><br />I could understand people complaining about space being an issue on any day other than today (while the app is free).<br /><br />Just another advantage of learning my phones limits and being rooted I guess.
B003K1EYM6|1.0|I purchased the connector to work with the new iPad and Apple 4s. I found out that the Apple connector does not see an 16gb sd card. I works with a 2gb card.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|this game would be really good but it keeps closing every time i get a combine. i have done a total of 10 minutes and it all of a widen closes :(
B004T2QZL8|2.0|Yeah, it's a fun game and worked alright for about 20 minutes, but then it stopped working and force closes almost everytime i try and make a combination... I hope that the devs fix this soon because it is a great game and makes you think.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|I absolutely love this game!..... but the force closing is an issue please fix. if it does get fixed more people will be able to enjoy it! p.s. three stars only cause of force close issue.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|the only reason this doesn't have five stars is because its a great game, but with a really annoying bug. I love alchemy and this is a beautifully rendered, nice set-up of that game. but when I combine an element, it force closes. please fix that and I will give it 5 stars in a raving review.
B0011ZNAIC|1.0|I was so happy to receive Bee Movie because my kids never seen it and when I went to play it, it didn't work. I was very disappointed and so were my kids
B004MNO0BQ|3.0|Bought the app because Amazon says it is compatible with both of my tablets and it won't install on either. Please add support for Ice Cream Sandwich.
0316743003|4.0|This book is a great history of Ben Rich and his long years in working with Kelly Johnson at Lockheed's Skunk Works.  It offers Ben's point of view along with the views of other participants of the material in each chapter (although not Kelly Johnson--see his autobiography for that), especially fighter jocks, pentagon officials, and defense secretary.  The book gets 4 stars because of some overstatements by Ben like the P-38 being the most maneuverable propeller aircraft of WWII.  Ben also has a distinctive point of view and not everyone will agree with him, for example his and Kelly Johnson's assessment of the Navy.<br /><br />WARNING TO THOSE OFFENDED BY PROFANITY:  Several of the contributors use some language that may be offensive to some readers, using 4 letter words and other profanity, so if that offends you, this is not the book for you.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|At first I thought, really I gotta register for this. But once I got started it was worth it. Really nice app. Saves your notes upon completion. Lots of nice features.
B003Y5H5HY|1.0|So I bought this film in the BR, DVD, Digital copy format thinking I would get the usual digital copy code. Nope, I got this UV crap that forces me to add yet another service to my full laptop and watch movies using their proprietary service. Not gonna happen. This is probably the last time I buy a physical disc of any film. Just checked on iTunes and the film is two dollars cheaper (17.99), plays on all my devices (admittedly all Apple products), and does not have to take up any more space on my drive. I can play in 1080p on my Apple TV, AND will play with captions as UV does not. Dear movie studios: you are making enough money, and I want simplicity... not this mess you are trying to sell me.
B003XT60KO|5.0|What do you mean, you haven't read it? Read this straight away. Do you want to understand economics in a way that is not weighed down with jargon and figures? This book is a simple explanation of the most fundamental issues in economics. In case you don't know, the author is one of the giants of austrian school economics. He has the gift of concise explanation and knows how to make a book about economic theory, fun to read. This book is great.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I really like the different Bible versions - wish I could download the NIV. The devotional plans are neat but seem a bit sluggish in response and updates
B004XE0P5E|5.0|Granted I don't purchase as much new music as I did previously, but it is not from lack of interest.  It is from lack of quality in General with Overly compressed music.  Bon Iver's second album is a refreshing change from the brain dead producing going on on most popular music releases.<br /><br />Although the lyrics are hard to decipher, they are easily looked up and reviewed.  The mix of guitar, alto vocal harmonies and phrasing, percussive effects, distortion, and classical bits.  The official video's are interesting as well, but alas, don't come with the CD.<br /><br />Highly recommended for rock fans who enjoy somewhat ethereal lyrics, percussive components.  Fans of Peter Gabriel & Pink Floyd should apply, I did!
B0058RCVYS|5.0|I must say I am enjoying being an Amazon Prime member and watching exceptional IFC films such as this one.  This movie was totally engaging.  I loved the clash of cultures depicted where Jacob ran an orphanage in India but had to travel to Denmark.  In Denmark, he visited a billionaire's family on their estate which looked like a place where titled countrymen would live. This was a business trip to apply for a large donation to Jacob's orphanage.  He gets a lot more than he bargained for when he is invited to attend the billionaire's daughter's wedding.  I love a movie that grips me from start to finish, and that is what happened here.  There is a wealth of emotion, suspense and beauty from the Danish location.  I wasn't expecting such a rich experience when I happened upon this film.  It makes me want to forgo the mainstream Hollywood theatrical films and further explore indie films.  When I used IFC as a search criteria there were quite a few Prime eligible Instant Amazon Videos.  I am looking forward to the journey that these unique films take me on.
1594203334|5.0|I hate to be dramatic about this, but sometimes a book comes along - the right book at the right time - and just puts everything into perspective.  As a brand spanking new mom of a 10-week-old, I was completely exhausted, completely unsure about what I was doing right vs. what I was doing wrong, and starting back at work.  In other words, a woman on the verge.  This book came along and was terrific, not because it has all the answers, but because it offers a lot of thoughtful ideas that create a vision of loving, balanced, common-sense parenting that works for me.  It's also just incredibly well written, with a wonderful mix of wry humor, stories, and just enough science to make the whole thing feel grounded.  It is not a story about being a neurotic mom who sees the light (thank God).  It is a story about looking at the world around and thinking about what lessons it might have to offer.  A nice antidote to all the hyperparenting nonsense bombarding new moms.  All in all a joy to read, very well-balanced, and a book that - in the effort to stave off unnecessary amounts of guilt and obsessiveness - I'm going to keep on the nightstand for a while.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I loved this game when I fist played it on the computer. My main problem was there was no &quot;kiddy&quot; version, so my little sister could watch. This version provided that, which made me very happy. Then BAM, the game force closed. I was upset, but then I noticed there was an update alert, and it was for Doodle God. It no longer force closes, and I can enjoy it again.

B005SV9X22|3.0|I have been a fan of Lady Gaga since the beginning so I specifically sought out this blu ray release.  However I have to admit that this was a bit of a disappointment especially considering some of the other blu ray releases by female artists in 2011. Three things about this that were disappointing to me were: The production value was missing  something--I really expected the scale to be larger and the design and costumes to just overall be more beautiful. The music seemed to be more centered around two dueling 80s guitars rather than driving dance beats, and above all I grew tired of Gaga screaming not only at the audience but me at home. So overall a bit of a let down.  I did enjoy Adele, Britney and Taylor Swifts blu ray releases in 2011 more by comparison.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Didn't freeze on me!  I love the damn game!!!  You Rock, God...  I mean Doodle God!  PLUS you might actually learn something!

1451683405|4.0|When I first heard of this book, I expected it to be written by Sam Harris the Neuroscientist rather than by Sam Harris the Philosopher. Although a small part of the book is dedicated to presenting some research that supports the lack of free will, most of the book comprises of philosophical justifications for this position, and the ethical repercussions of embracing it. Both were thought provoking and interesting, but it seems to me that a certain amount of faith is still required in order to accept the lack of free will argument.<br />I am a Sam Harris fan and I believe that most people will gain something by reading his works, but this book I would've liked better if its science portion was more substantial.<br /><br />I almost deducted a star for the price/length, but at 6$ (for kindle) this is still within my acceptable range, although only hardly so.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|I like this game so much more than alchemy. The layout is much better, the artwork is fun, and I like the quotes that pop up when you make a bee element. The only problem is that I can't play anymore because it keeps force closing whenever I combine elements... It was working just fine, then it randomly started doing it... 5* once they fix it. Game is currently unplayable.

B001DHXT1G|4.0|I saw the first Hulk and that was just awful.  This one, with a whole new cast and a new director, seems to pick up where the first one leaves off, but it turned out to be a much, much better movie.  The acting was good, the storyline made a lot more sense than the other one, and this was a very good film.  The ending was really cool.  I wont give it away, but it's not what you expect and it's a very fitting way to end the movie.  I'd recommend this to everyone, but I'd also recommend seeing Iron Man and Captain America first just so that the ending makes sense.  Aside from the ending, this is a great film.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|The very first Star Wars film, which as it turns out was not the beginning of the story, was a triumph and had me hooked. I watched the others that followed, but then knew that if I had the complete set I could watch them over and over. The blu-ray edition adds to the depth and quality of a great series of episodes. My order was dispatched quickly and I was very pleased with all the information I received at each stage of the dispatch process. Thanks!
B004T2QZL8|2.0|I was enjoying the game until the app started force closing everytime I tried combining an element. It worked fine for about 45 minutes.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I feel like I was the last person in the world to read these books, but I'm glad I finally did.  They weren't perfect by any means.  Katniss was a strong MC but she was flawed too.  Her relationships weren't perfect and there was no insta-love.  And the romance was more of a side plot than the main focus, which was a refreshing change.<br /><br />I don't know what else I can about these books that hasn't already been said.  They were great reads.
B004LWZW8I|1.0|It has been a little while; well since \\"Priest\\" came out that I have written such a bad review. This movie was a complete waste of time and money, not only on my part; but on the parts of everyone who \\"acted\\" in it or had anything to do with its production. The characters were not sincere and I really think high school drama students could have done better. The whole thing seems to practically take place on the edge of a cliff in one part of the world or another, the costumes are silly, the Gods are always whining about something, and the special effects look like late 90s C G I. I couldn't even finish this whole movie, I shut it off with 15 minutes left to go; that's how bad it really was, I could not bring my self to sit there for 15 more minutes and spent the rest of the day wondering why I had watched the bulk of this thing in the first place.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|I held off on buying the COMPLETE Version because I figured, \\"20-30 minutes of bonus content, probably just one or two scenes tagging along, can't be all that different from the original.\\"<br />WRONG. This is a different movie! AND it is much more excellent. The ORIGINAL should be called \\"Advent Children INCOMPLETE\\"!<br />Every flaw in the plot and inconsistencies has been resolved in this release. Geostigma and its cause is MUCH more understandable. Character motivations are given more weight. Cloud's past with Zach gets some screen time.  (They even fixed the parts where the motorbikes go backward. Only the people are allowed to defy physics now haha)<br />I'm no longer ashamed to show it to friends for fear that they couldn't make sense of anything. I used to watch it just out of artistic appreciation. Now the plot makes sense, too.<br />Very worth the purchase. If you didn't understand the original film but appreciated its artistic quality, you will love this.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|I.thought this app would be cool but it was horrible. DONT GET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You will just waste your time I mean look how much storage I takes up I have 5 apps that tame up less storage.combined and doubled
0307389839|4.0|Just a beautifully written book. I don't do marathons (or triathlons) but I agree with and believe in so much of what this guy is talking about. He treats running as both an activity and as a metaphor-as a place to literally execute his commitment to improvement and hard work in the form of a little bit further or a little bit faster. Because if you can do it there, when no one is watching and it doesn't count, than you can sure do it for the rest of your life.<br /><br />This is actually something Tim Ferriss has been talking about, which is that you need some sort of physically activity in your life so that it function as a steady drip of excellence: your company may be having financial troubles but you just beat your mile time or maxed our your deadlift. This book is kind of a diary of one man (a enormously successful novelist) who has done and is doing that. It's got good examples of how to talk to your body-rather, how to kick it around-and how to motivate yourself and appreciate solitude. Again, it's very short but very poetic and worth reading.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|I really like this app but at around the 70 element point it force closes when you attempt to combine elements, and this issue persists unless you clear the data or uninstall the app. I want to keep playing, please fix this!!
0307279189|5.0|I have a bad habit where I put off reading a book if I hear it recommended too many times. It stems from being underwhelmed by the flavor of the week long read (normally The New Yorker) or whatever blogs seem to be passing around and splooging all over. In the case of Born to Run, I made a mistake and I wish I'd read it sooner. No question it had plenty of the cringe-worthy moments I was reticent about, but it's worth reading anyway. Like The Tiger by John Valliant, there is a shocking amount of applicable and interesting evolutionary science in here, and from what I know it's all pretty legit.<br /><br />For a non-fiction book about running, it's very readable and interesting enough to keep you going even if you are not a runner. This is also its weakness; you can tell the writer's background as a magazine writer resigns him to a sort of pull-quote mentality and all the other obnoxious tricks that magazines employ. The idea that we evolved to run long distance (as opposed to only sprinting when fleeing predators) is something that I don't think has been properly accounted for in paleo-communities. Persistance hunting, for example, is something he discusses well in this book. That Taleb and others advocate only walking and never distance running has not sat well with me-they've never felt the accomplishment of slowly seeing your endurance grow; the rhythm your feet, lungs, music and heartbeat fall into on a long run; the commitment it takes to hit a goal day in and day out. This book is about those things and how deeply rooted they are in us. And how, ironically, the industry that surrounds running has done its best to destroy and undermine those feelings.
B000244FDW|3.0|Althought this version has the wonderful costumes and large amounts of Jane Austen's beautiful dialogue (althought not necessarily said by the characters who uttered them in the novel) it is still not my favorite version.  The main reason... I don't like their Mr. Darcy.  The trick is creating the cold and aloof Darcy who is really shy and caring underneath.  They have the cold and aloof part and that is all.  Whether poor directing or poor acting or a combination of both... this version just never warmed my heart.  I found it hard to believe Elizabeth would ever find anything redeeming in this Mr. Darcy.  Grab one of the many other lush versions (A&E is excellent) and enjoy that instead.
B006470HZ6|5.0|I was surprised to see the 3 out of 5 for this season.  I have not noticed it being slow at all.  I mean, do people want zombie attacks and people dieing 100% of the time?  Perhaps the people who are alive are getting a little bit of their humanity back, or at least starting to be able to think and act like people.  There have been some MAJOR things that have happened so far this season.  I think is is going at a good speed.  I have a feeling they are working everyone up for something big.  I have no problem with this season.  The first season they were meeting each other and trying to find a safe place to stay.  Now that they have, things (though still dangerous) are as good at the time as they can have it.  They are making the best of what they can.  Plus, after all they have been and are going through, I guess they would be a bit dramatic.  How can you expect humans to deal with the things they are?  The end of the world, the end of most of the human race, a new unknown enemy with no brains just a lust to kill and eat them.  I like this season.  It keeps me on the edge of my seat, well the edge of my bed.  You can not expect action 100% of the time.  It's like life.  You get a little bit of everything.  If you watched and liked the first season, this is another good season.  Very important things will happen that change everything.  Give it a chance!!!!
B004T2QZL8|1.0|Enjoyed the game for Incredible v.1 until, like everyone else it seems, the game decided to FC. Yet another decent game undermined by instability.
B0059XTUB8|3.0|With all due respect to Michelle Williams, a fine actress, who I'm sure put her heart and soul into this part, she just doesn't capture the brilliant essence of Marilyn Monroe. For the moment let's forget she doesn't look anything like Marilyn, nor does she possess the iconic curves (I would love to know why they didn't give the part to Scarlett Johannson, a wonderful actress who does possess those physical attributes). But the real missing ingredient here is Marilyn's dazzling screen presence. That's no knock on Williams! You can count on one hand the number of actresses who possessed the sort of presence as Monroe. Personally, I found the performances by Judy Dench and Emma Watson to be more captivating. But then again, they didn't have the unenviable task of trying to portray a screen legend! As a huge fan of Monroe I found the movie interesting, and I'm certainly glad I watched it. To be fair, Michelle Williams does an admirable job of portraying the person BEHIND the presence: an insecure, lonely, and unhappy woman. But I'd be lying if I said I wasn't ultimately disappointed. For those who aren't familiar with Marilyn's work, I think they would find the movie much more enjoyable. For those of us who are...there simply are no substitutes.
B006SMLAMQ|2.0|The display is cool when you load the application. It is pretty lacking in the widget department though. The only widget for the droid Razr is very simple. Just displays the weather, not weather and time as shown in the applications pictures. Fancy widget is a much better choice in my opinion.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is the kind of reading that you can't put down.  You also wonder when you finish the 3 books how could they possibly make a movie of this book and do it justice.  Yes I will go see the movie and hope they honor the author's theme by not changing anything about \\"The Hunger Games\\".  I highly suggest this reading for people who love sci-fy, love love stories, or love action pack adventures.[[ASIN:B004XJRQUQ The Hunger Games Trilogy]]
B004T2QZL8|1.0|Fun game but please fix the freaking problem. It constantly force close every time I tried to combine 2 elements.

0393338398|5.0|Financial journalist Michael Lewis brought his background in financial markets to bear on the subject of baseball in \\"Moneyball.\\" When the Oakland A's performed as well or better than many teams whose payrolls far exceeded theirs, Lewis recognized that the A's scouting strategy paralleled what arbitrageurs and hedge fund managers do on Wall St.: they saw inefficiencies in the market in which they participated (in this case, the labor of the players) and sought to exploit those inefficiencies to their benefit. In \\"Moneyball,\\" Lewis does a stellar job of telling the story of the A's Phoenix-like rise from the poorest team in the league to break the record for the longest winning streak in AL history (20 games). Told in layman's terms that even non-baseball fans will understand and find fascinating, \\"Moneyball\\" is a fun, interesting and educational read.

1594484805|5.0|In \\"Drive,\\" author Dan Pink delves into decades of scientific research to reveal what really motivates us. Generations of corporate and nonprofit managers who have been using traditional carrot-and-stick incentives to motivate employees will discover in \\"Drive\\" why such measures can often be counterproductive. As he did in his previous book, \\"A Whole New Mind,\\" Pink demonstrates how today's employees thrive on creativity and self-reliance. So what's the secret to what really drives us? And what's the best way to motivate employees? Hint: The answers lie in the differences between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation.
B006IGZWB2|3.0|The feeling of guilt I had when viewing The Blind Side were echoed with The Help. Like that movie, it took the issue of racism and turned it into light-hearted comedy; all the while, the African American characters were left totally under developed.<br /><br />For example: *Spoiler Alert* When the one maid defecated in her boss' pie, she was simply blacklisted. If it was truly reminiscent of pre-civil-rights Mississippi, she would've been tracked down and killed! Just to pay tribute to the real horrors of the south at the time, the filmakers did throw in one KKK related murder plot, but it seemed half-hearted and lazy.<br /><br />The big saving grace of this film are the performances. Octavia Spencer more than deserved her Oscar win. Viola Davis was also excellent. But that brings up the bigger problem: how come talentless pretty white actresses like Katherine Heigel and Kate Hudson can continue getting starring roles in Hollywood films while brilliant actresses like Octavia Spencer and Viola Davis are still playing maids? If anything, that's the biggest question that arises from this film.
0439023521|5.0|Told from the perspective of the main character, Katniss, THE HUNGER GAMES takes place in a future where the United States as we know it no longer exists. The book never explains exactly what happened, but years earlier there was some sort of economic collapse and global catastrophe. In the aftermath, what was once the continent of North America is now a country called Panem. In what is explained in THE HUNGER GAMES, Panem was controlled by a massive Capitol City that ruled over thirteen separate districts. The disparity between the Capitol and the Districts was so great that the Districts rebelled. As a result of the civil war that followed, District Thirteen was destroyed. Each year from that point forward, a male and female child between the ages of 12-18 is selected by lottery to take part in The Hunger Games, a massive event where the participants were forced to fight to the death until only one person remains.<br />When her younger sister, Prim, is selected as the tribute for District Twelve, Katniss volunteers to take her place. She is joined by Peeta Mellark, the son of the local baker. The two soon become almost inseparable and become two of the stars of one of the most unusual Hunger Games ever.<br /><br />I really enjoyed THE HUNGER GAMES. The book has echoes of the Greek myths of Theseus and the Labyrinth, but it also reminded me of Stephen King's THE LONG WALK. However, despite these influences, THE HUNGER GAMES is a new and exciting work. It's over three-hundred pages long, but is an incredibly quick read. It's a page-turner that is difficult to put down. It's a book full of relevant themes for our times, but deals with these issues in ways that young adults can comprehend and understand.  Also, the story has a little something for everyone: it's not just an action story, it's not just a romance, it's not just a dramatic piece of literature. It contains elements of all those things. Lastly, it features a female heroine who truly is someone girls can look up to. There aren't very many great pieces of fiction that feature such a strong, moral, upstanding, and courageous young woman as the protagonist.<br /><br />Overall, THE HUNGER GAMES is an exciting story with elements of several different genres. It features a strong female as the protagonist. Though the book ends on a note of conflict, it sets things up for future volumes.ok up to.

B007HJ91HU|4.0|I have to admit: I'm much too young to have seen the original FOOTLOOSE. With that being said, I still think if a remake succeeds it should be able to be good on its own merits. Especially in this case, because, like me, a majority of the audience probably aren't familiar with the original.<br /><br />As far as the actual plot goes, I was impressed! The main character had an intriguing story and was an immensely likable character. The love story was so much more organic than 99 perent of modern romance movies. I also was impressed at how well this film dealt with issues like domestic abuse, the effects of over parenting and the negative effects of over-the-top Christian fundamentalism. Oh, yeah, the dancin' ain't too bad either.
B005PK55BE|5.0|Update 1/11/13: I wrote this review for the first episode only, at the beginning of Season 3 when the DVD set for the season was not available. Amazon since cross-posted this review under the reviews for the whole season, so it appears as if I wrote two reviews for Season 3, which I actually did not. On to the review for Episode 1:<br /><br />This show remains consistently high quality! Season 3 gets off to an exciting start with this initial episode titled, \\"A New Day.\\"<br /><br />Coming off of all the struggles of Season 2, Alicia Florrick (Julianna Margulies) has emerged as much more confident in herself both as a woman and as an attorney at Lockhart/Gardner.<br /><br />In her personal life, Alicia has left her husband Peter Florrick (Chris Noth) after finding out he had a one-night stand years ago with Kalinda Sharma (Archie Panjaba), the firm's private investigator. In spite of the fact that Kalinda did not know Alicia then, this explosive revelation makes it impossible for Alicia to be anywhere near Kalinda without feeling an overwhelming urge to scream at her friend or burst into tears--which is a real problem since they have to work together on cases at Lockhart/Gardner.<br /><br />Kalinda, who normally is a really tough nut, is shown at the end of Season 2 visibly heartbroken over losing her friendship with Alicia, which was one of the closest she'd ever had. On the heels of what Alicia sees as a double betrayal, she has kicked Peter out of their apartment and dumped him and his possessions into an apartment she got for him. As apparent retaliation, Peter, who just got re-elected to his old office as State's Attorney, strictly because of Alicia's high-profile loyalty and support during his campaign, at the end of Season 2 hires Cary Agos (Matt Czuchry) to be his second-in-command. Cary has been Alicia's enemy since Season 1 when she beat him out for an associate position at Lockhart/Gardner.<br /><br />Alicia has begun talks with Lockhart/Gardner's barracuda divorce attorney, David Lee (the immensely talented Zach Grenier), and launched a torrid affair with Will Gardner (Josh Charles). For multiple reasons, Alicia and Will opt to keep their affair top secret: he is her boss, she is still legally married to Peter, and she doesn't want her kids to know about the affair.<br /><br />On a professional front in this episode, Alicia takes the lead when the firm opts to defend a Muslim college student accused of assaulting a Jewish student during a campus brawl. Initially the case seems like a slam dunk for Alicia because no physical evidence exists to link their client to the crime, and Kalinda discovers a photo that offers an alibi for their client. Alicia is also convinced that the State's Attorney's office's hate-crime charge against her client is simply Peter showboating for the news media during his first week back in office. Then Cary and his prosecution team reveal their true plan--the same evidence that exonerates Alicia's client from the assault may implicate him as the primary suspect in a murder investigation.<br /><br />This show does a great job every week (both for this first episode and all the other episodes of this season and the previous two seasons) of offering interesting cases for Lockhart/Gardner to represent. The writers keep these cases enthralling to viewers by offering spicy--and sometimes humorous--conflicts for the lawyers such as client chicanery to be worked around, in-house rivalries threatening to torpedo the success of a given case, or mysteries for the ruthlessly capable Kalinda to solve in order to prove a client's innocence or win a case. In addition, whatever the overarching legal plot, it always deftly intertwines with the many personal-relationship subplots occurring every week. Each of the characters is linked to multiple other characters in an ever spreading web of secrets, lies and conniving, but the show's highly talented writers (Michelle and Robert King) never drop any threads orcross the line into outright soapiness, which so much of nighttime drama seems to inevitably end up doing.cross the line into outright soapiness, which so much of nighttime drama seems to inevitably end up doing.
B006YXTRHY|1.0|Please note: I'm actually male; which means I'm more than aware the Twilight movies weren't made for me. With that being said, I at least somewhat enjoyed the first 3 Twilight films. While those ones were more than chock-full of over-the-top romantic melodrama, there were more than enough moments of action and sincere romantic sentiment to keep me interested.<br /><br />That brings me to Breaking Darn: Part 1. This hardly even seemed like a movie! It may have started where the last one left off, but it just stayed in a static motion. While we felt the emotions of Bella and Edward in the first three, it seems like every ounce of emotional sincerity was sucked out of them as soon as they got married.<br /><br />And then *Spoiler Alert* Bella gets pregnant with Edward's baby. While it was an intriguing concept, it wasn't worth making almost the whole movie about. Also, the pro-life message was over-the-top and tacky. I strongly believe political messages can be conveyed convincingly in movies, but the pro-life message seemed so forced.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you casually enjoyed to first three, skip this one and wait unti the last one. You won't miss much.

B007C9N4H8|4.0|The creators of this movie made two serious \\"Muppet character flaws\\" in the movie, which takes away from its magic. First is how Kermit lives in a mansion. Every person who simply knows about Kermit by name, would feel odd upon seeing Kermit living in a mansion because Kermit would in no way ever really live in one. Rather, Kermit should have rather been shown as having lived in a simple home; doing so would have made the movie so much better.<br /><br />The second \\"Muppet character flaw\\" is the suggestion by Fozzie The Bear in utilizing Fart shoes as a Muppet joke, which is also in the trailer. This is then looked down upon as not being a good suggestion by the other Muppets. The problem here is, despite being looked down upon by The Muppets themselves, is that Fozzie would have never actually considered a fart joke to be used by the Muppets. It's ridiculous and yes, it does harm the entire film. A simple editing out of this scene would make the movie better.<br /><br />Combined, these two omissions would have made the movie 5 stars, and would have brought the Muppets to their glory & \\"magic\\" of when Jim Henson was alive, and made the other films made after his passing seem like a joke. (save \\"The Muppet Christmas Carol\\" which is only in line with the former Muppet \\"magic\\" largely in part in being in line with a famous novel) With them however, its clear that this movie is just like the others made after \\"The Muppet Christmas Carol.\\" These are literally just \\"good,\\" but lacking in having \\"Muppet magic.\\"
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Nothing wrong with this game, except that the free point you can get for downloading new games points you to the google app market, not the amazon market.  But its a good way to waste a fee minutes.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|I really like this game I don't understand why people don't like it its very addictive and fun :) its awesome and really great
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is ohhkay its fun to play when your bored. Little kids loving playing it. I play it on the bus or on my way to work. :D
B006C1DH92|5.0|I think this game is fun for all ages.  what's more fun than watching a movie star slicing dirfrent fruits
B004T2QZL8|3.0|Would be a fantastic game if they would fix the force close issue... Really cool application, great idea, just fix force close issue!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are pretty fun and some a bit challenging, but getting coins isn't as easy as I thought it'd be.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|constant force close is a major problem with this app. I have it installed on a tablet and a phone happens on both devices.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I got it and tried it very fun there are a few that are hard and u try to beat them very addiction had fun Stell, having fun
B004T2QZL8|1.0|It would be a fun game if it didn't force close every other second. Don't waist your time. Try alchemy
B004T2QZL8|2.0|As others have pointed out you can combine the same two things over and over.  This doesn't create anything new it just wastes your time and becomes frustrating.  If I have already combined them, just ignore it and do nothing.  Or graphically show me which ones I have combined.  Don't waste my time.<br /><br />To make matters worse, they keep moving things around.  This makes it hard to remember what you have combined.<br /><br />Not much to this game.  Just combine two objects and hope they do something special.  When they do then you try to combine the new thing with other things.  The only nice thing about this are the quotes you get when you combine things.  It gets boring and frustrating after about an hour or so.<br /><br />I tried this app about a year ago and it doesn't seem to have changed.  In fact a new feature is still listed as coming soon.<br /><br />km - 3-20-2012<br /><br />Try other alchemy type apps rather then this.

B002VECM4K|4.0|This is an extremely powerful and emotional film, incredible acting by all.  Who would have thought Mariah Carey had acting chops but she and everyone involved produced one of the most affecting films ever.  That said, this very dialogue driven film does not benefit from Blu ray and may even have been degraded in the transfer.  Almost no use of the surrounds, not even the short scene of Precious walking in the train station with the train pulling up on the right.  While any dialogue driven film will have less use for the surrounds than an action film, there are still those moments when they could have been used.  The video transfer, while clean in that I could see no noise, suffers from greatly crushed blacks removing details in the shadow areas.  There is one scene where Precious is in a hallway with her black leather jacket and you can barely see the creases in the jacket, the blacks are crushed so much.  So for the movie itself, 5 stars, for the transfer I can give it only 2.5<br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanks
1401937519|5.0|I have listened to an interview between Anita & Cheryl Richardson, and if what she says doesn't alter your life, well, you need to re-think what you're doing.<br />I found it to be confirmation of what I've been trying to do with my own life, only not so well....overthinking things for one not trusting myself was another.  Listening to Anita was a serious light bulb moment for me.<br />I for one will be remembering my magnificence and doing things to make me happy in the future.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|it truley has 101 games but u have to earn them by getting points I love the game and I'm adicked to and u will be to
B004T2QZL8|2.0|Fun until it has a &quot;forced close&quot; crash and I have to wipe out the progress to get it work again, because it constantly bombs when combining elements.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|I was deciding between this and the original London cast recording. I had both many years back, but lost them both. I'll probably still buy the original London cast recording as well, but this is really good. Brings back memories.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|I have played this before and it is awesome I understand low ratings because of force close. However that does not take away its a good game once amazon updates with a fix you will be happy you got this as a faotd. Three for being a good game and 1 because its finally here I'll give it another once fixed
B004T2QZL8|1.0|I had really hoped that the vast majority of reviews were wrong.  I tried and tried again thinking &quot;This time I'll get the hang of the game and it will be awesome!&quot;  No such luck.  It sucked from the time I started to the time I quit and uninstalled the app.  The only. thing saving it from 0 stars (besides not being able to give out 0 stars) is that it did work on my Kindle Fire.  But that is it.  : (
B004T2QZL8|1.0|do not download it force closes every time. awful game, the developers should spend more time fixing the force close issues.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great app.  I have it on all my devices but use it the most on my Kindle.  I love all the different versions of the Bible and it's so easy to follow along at church.  The reading plans are awesome. Can keep going but won't.
B005HSG3VK|2.0|As far as protecting your Fire, this will do the job.  The plastic hugs the machine and the softer black cover protects the screen.  So, if this product was $15 or $20, I'd be fine.  But it was $30 and that is very expensive for how flimsy it is.  Standing it up, like it shows in the picture relies on balance.  So if kids touch it, or you are on an airplane, it won't stay.  I'm going to keep this, but I'm disappointed.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|The game is fun while it works. But crashes unexpectedly A LOT. Running it on Droid Razr. Would be 5 star if I could play it w/out interruption.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|A blast. Makes you use your brain.  Very addictive, fun, fun, fun.  Very addictive highly recommended. Works great on the Kindle Fire.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|I wanted to buy this movie. How disappointing that Sony/WB (and others) are forcing us to watch movies through their proprietary software, and through streaming only - don't expect to be able to watch this on your tablet on your way down to Cancun. The movie itself is great. But until the film industry relents on our digital rights, technologies like UltraViolet Digital Copy will earn the movies 1 star from me.<br /><br />Update: The product title now lists as \\"+ UltraViolet Digital Copy\\" instead of just \\"+ Digital Copy\\". I gave 1 star previously as this was misleading to buyers who truly care about the formats they are purchasing (like me). Now that the listing is clear, I will rate the movie as I enjoyed it: 5 stars.
B003EYVXXW|4.0|SPOILER ALERT! I find it particularly disturbing that the unjust demise of Hypatia at the hands of an angry mob of Christians took place during Lent of 415 A.D.! As to the ungodly scoundrels who perpetrated this horrific crime against a defenseless woman in true cowardly fashion and who by their very actions rejected the timeless teachings of Jesus (especially that part about loving others), couldn't they at least have given up torture and murder during Lent the way later generations of their Lent-observing progeny give up candy and cake?<br /><br />And to anyone who wants a crash course on the differences between the teachings OF Jesus and the teachings ABOUT Jesus, there is always the distant echo of Hypatia's screams to cut through the clouds of chaos as just one of many examples that emerges through the thread of time and the needle of space to remind us how differently Jesus would have reacted to Hypatia and the angry mob compared to the worst of what can happen when the name of Jesus becomes merely an outside thing worn like a fancy logo on a uniform for a local sports team.<br /><br />Whether based on the 77 Urantia Papers devoted exclusively to the unabridged version of Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Jesus or the Bible's Gospel accounts, the Jesus I know would have undoubtedly rescued Hypatia from this dire situation had He been incarnated on the temporal stage of tragedy depicted in this film where all tangible traces of her slaughtered innocence slowly slipped away from her mutilated femininity with the final few breaths that passed across her fading lips into the winter darkness of a silent abyss. How quickly Hypatia would have embraced Jesus and become a true believer had His facial expression of unconditional love been the last image she saw at the very end of her mortal journey.<br /><br />If the eyes are the windows to the Soul, then just imagine how Light from Paradise reflected through the eyes of Jesus could have reduced that crime scene to a tiny speck of cosmic dust.e to a tiny speck of cosmic dust.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I love dystopian fiction and this is the cream of the crop. Can't remember the last time a book had me so captivated.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|Added: Just downloaded the update. It's working again, so I can now rate this game 4 stars. Now, it just needs to show new combos only.<br /><br />Decided to get this game because I enjoyed Alchemy so much. The game was pretty fun at first. I like being able to see the different elements in each category. But now the game keeps force closing on me. Also, recreating  combinations that have already been made is a big annoyance. Will give two stars when FC problem is fixed and one star when feature to create new combos only is added. HTC Evo.

B004R9AFNM|4.0|One of Green Day's best. Excellent sound quality and energy that highlights why they're such an excellent live act.  Well produced, but not over-produced like many live albums today.  Songs retain a raw sound that eclipses their studio versions. I've gotten a bit tired of Green Day over the past few years - Broadway plays, etc.  This album reminds me of why I liked them so much to begin with.
B007M6P01O|3.0|How can I get Hershel's shotgun? The one that has 300 rounds? The zombie apocalypse would be a piece of cake with that. Also, how can I set a smokeless fire? That would be a great way to perpetuate insurance fraud and get sympathy at the same time.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|So I started playing the game and liked it but now all of a sudden it won't stop force closing. I've read a lot of other people's reviews and they are having the same problem. Since you are getting the same force close complaint, why don't you fix it? Now I'm going to uninstall it because the force closing really makes me mad.

B006MNTT74|5.0|Romantically speaking, the delicate crescendo of unfinished love dominates this powerful classic (easily one of the finest dramatic musicals ever produced). The unfolding of love, passion, and intimacy between Tony and Maria, like the riptide, spills into the soul of this film. Their whispered and orchestrated words on the balcony create nuances beyond the realm of normal drama. Their marriage before God establishes their union, solidifies the romantic crescendo, and allows Maria to mourn her husband's death at the end. It is a complete tragedy on all respective levels.<br /><br />All meetings between Tony (played by Richard Beymer) and Maria (played by Natalie Wood) are stunning in presentation. The musical overtures are superb, the dancing is brilliant, and the conflict between the Jets and Sharks (women included) has its own originality in classical terms. Yet, Maria alone commands the stage in virtually all tender moments (except those involving Anita); our heroine's softness, intelligence, and untested wisdom establishes her emotive control of the play (start to finish). In as much as her humility does not detract from the other powerful performances, Maria displays honor, sacrifice, depth, and commitment throughout the entire drama. We observe Natalie Wood in her finest hour as a gifted actress.<br /><br />The principles of romantic tragedy dominant this play in its careful adherence to the plot and character development within Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet (who is Maria's unspoken mentor in matters of passion and control of one's lover). She redirects Tony away from secreted romance into the tragic consequences of interfering with the rumble; the deaths of Bernardo (her brother) and Riff (Tony's closest friend) are related (within dramatic irony) to her secret intervention (supposedly on their behalf). In truth, this masterpiece resides in both categories, tragedy and romance; bound (perhaps) by her mournful voice, \\"Don't you touch him!\\" Our catharsis is directly affected by Maria's youthful passion related to unfinished love in its most delicate stages.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|This app looks to be fun and a great way to spend some time. But this app locked up and crashed my dual core Attrix 2.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Bought Book One on 3/2 and paid $6.99 for it. Came back tonight to buy the next book and got a bit of a shock. The price has been raised to $9.99. This series got a lot of publicity and it's pretty disappointing that \\"whomever\\" has chosen to exploit that. I cannot support a nearly 50% increase in price which just reflects profit and greed. Not sure who was responsible for this but shame shame shame on you.
B003JTHWJQ|1.0|This work of science fiction was very poorly researched, and \\"facts\\" were in short supply.<br />Where all this individuals pure, unadultered hatred comes from, I have no ideal, but it<br />comes through loud and clear. His answer to every religious ideal and every fact (actual facts)<br />regarding intelligent design is always \\"natural selection\\" :) !<br />And of course he can't get around the fact that there was a beginning and a creator; his frustration<br />seems to boil over regarding this fact, and he relentlessly and fruitlessly asks where the creator came ftom......<br />This author appears to know for a fact that with sufficient time, anything can occur :) !<br />He's really good at picking and choosing his own pet facts to fit any situation and of<br />course proving his \\"comments from the edge\\" (of Neptune more than likely! ).<br />Just knowing that there are individuals such as this writer at large provide more than<br />enough evidence and proof that the state of America and the world as a whole<br />have been influenced to a sickening degree by such \\"learned\\" 'men of science'<br />as this character.

076115678X|5.0|I didn't hear about Deva Curl until sometime after my BC in February 2010. I didn't understand, until I read Lorraine Massey's CG Handbook, how important she and Teri LaFlesh are to unlocking the mysteries of multi-cultural curly hair. Their books compliment each other. I read Lorraine's book and watched the DVD the same day it was delivered. I also read it again that Saturday and that Sunday. I felt there was important information for multi-cultural curlies that was missing. The before pics of two of the multi-cultural models on the DVD flashed by so quickly, I had to replay that section several times to get an idea of how their hair looked prior to the process. I get that there are only so many pages to a book and Lorraine was graciously inclusive. I particularly like that her products and techniques like Teri's are inclusive. I also read Teri's book as soon as I purchased it. I incorporate information and techniques from both ladies into my hair routines. I try to keep it as simple as possible. It's going to take another year or so for my hair to grow long enough to take advantage of the DevaChan salon experience. I can't wait. I'll update my review when I do so.
1118109791|5.0|The OG13 has flaws, as did its predecessors. Why five stars, then? Because, hands down, this latest incarnation of the OG is still the one book to get, if you can only get one book to prepare for the GMAT with. There's simply no better all-in-one source of retired GMAT problems.    Could the explanations be better? Sure.  Could the GMAT folks have replaced more than just 1 in 6 problems from the OG12? Absolutely.  Why did some repeated problems illogically jump the line backwards or forwards, given that both OG12 and OG13 are supposed to be in order of difficulty? Who knows.    All that said, the OG is still THE primary religious text of the GMAT. Everything else--including all that we write in print or in byte--is commentary.    The 158 new problems in OG13 all exude that sweet, ineffable air of GMAT-ness. Even if you're taking the GMAT before the changeover (on June 5), in your shoes I'd buy this book for those new problems alone. In the grand scheme, I'd consider that a good investment.    If you're taking the GMAT on June 5 or after, you also need to prepare for the new Integrated Reasoning section. This book gives you access to 50 IR practice problems on a separate site online. Another reason to purchase.    Now, on to the analysis...    Analysis of the 13th Edition Official Guide    (This analysis was originally published with additional content at [...])    The 13th Edition of the Official Guide for GMAT Review has finally been released publicly. Here at Manhattan GMAT, we've done an initial analysis of the OG13 book.    1. Not Radically Different    OG13 contains 907 practice problems for the \\"main\\" part of the GMAT (Quant & Verbal). Of those 907 problems, only 17% are new. Since you know your fraction equivalents, we don't have to tell you that 17% is about 1 out of 6.    Out of 907 problems, 749 are repeats (yes, that's 5 out of 6). If you already have the 12th Edition, a good way to look at the 13th Edition is as a source of 158 great new practice problems. We've listed them by number at the end of this post.    Much of the book is unchanged from the 12th Edition:  - For repeated problems, the explanations are identical, except for a few extremely minor edits (e.g., fixing an error in numbers chosen to test Statement 1 in DS #135).  - Various sections, such as the Diagnostic Exam (all 100 problems), Math Review, Test-Taking Strategies and Directions, are unchanged.  - Each of the 5 major types (PS, DS, RC, CR, and SC) has the same number of problems as before: 254 PS, 198 DS, 156 RC, 141 CR, and 158 SC.  - Excluding the Diagnostic Exam, practice questions are organized by difficulty, according to the GMAC--just as they are in the 12th edition--but with an asterisk we'll explain below.    We've done all the new problems, and they're just what you'd expect--good, clever GMAT problems. Each one has its own unique flavor, but they're all from the same big box of cookies. Given that only 1 in 6 are new, we don't ascribe too much meaning to the unavoidable micro-shifts in topical balance.    Do not over-interpret changes from OG12 to OG13! Some variation is to be expected. Nothing suggests a shift in how you should prepare for the exam.    2. Transition If And When You're Comfortable    If you've been getting ready with the 12th Edition, treat the 13th Edition as a source of additional practice. But you do not need to switch, especially if your exam is before June 5, when the new GMAT arrives.    If you're taking an \\"old\\" GMAT, consider mining the 13th Edition for a few new problems.  But your time may be better spent reviewing practice problems you've already encountered. Or you might just do online practice with GMATPrep, GMATFocus, or practice exams such as ours.    3. Integrated Reasoning is Integrated    If you are taking the \\"new\\" GMAT (on or after June 5), the OG13 has some relevant goodies for you: a short introduction to IR, plus access to 50 brand-new practice problems online. Even though the IR section won't count for much in the admissions process, you don't want to face it completely cold. Running through these 50 problems will help warm you up.    In fact, you might catch fire and start freaking out about IR. If that happens, go dunk your head in water. IR is not that important. You just want to give it a decent shot. Save your strength for the main event of the GMAT.    4. Order Oddities    Both OG12 and OG13 claim to be laid out in order of difficulty (except for the 100 Diagnostics). Since all the problems are retired from the real exam, that order should never change--so you'd expect repeated problems to maintain their relative positions in the hierarchy.    Weirdly, though, 25 repeated problems have jumped out of position. Here are the rebels:    Problem Solving:  13th Ed. 12th Ed. Change  20 203 -183  25 200 -175  31 64 -33  55 196 -141  65 28 37  67 201 -134  95 106 -11  109 69 40  126 228 -102  132 93 39  181 202 -21    Data Sufficiency:  13th Ed. 12th Ed. Change  4 47 -43  38 134 -96  53 165 -112  58 171 -113  67 30 37  78 137 -59  81 58 23  119 173 -54  120 147 -27  125 107 18  128 157 -29  135 128 7  143 161 -18  166 132 34    While we've understood and agreed with the OG difficulty ordering in broad strokes, we've always wondered about some of the specific rankings. Is Marcia's Bucket (DS #174) truly the hardest DS problem on the planet, three editions running--11th, 12th, and 13th? That one has always bewildered us.    The reshuffle is generally in the right direction, if we were doing the ranking of those 25 problems. For instance, we think that PS #69 in the 12th is harder than PS #196 in the 12th, not conceptually but in actual execution. Old #69 is tricky! Now the new numbering (#109 and #55, respectively, in OG13) reflects that opinion.    However, the mystery is why this reshuffling is happening at all. If the problems were in relative order of difficulty in one edition, any repeats should stay in that order till the end of time--since the problems are most definitely retired!    This weird reordering happened before on a smaller scale, when the supplemental Review OGs transitioned from 1st to 2nd Editions. One problem in each slipped out of position. That level of change could be chalked up to clerical error or to random genetic mutation caused by a stray cosmic ray or what have you.    However, with 25 problems on the quant side (and none on the verbal side) acting illogically, we can only guess at something larger. It should be straightforward for the GMAT to measure difficulty--it's a basic parameter for each question, a single number developed during the problem's experimental stage and then frozen. Perhaps, for a whole batch of questions, these parameters were recorded in a systematically erroneous way, and now GMAC is fixing the problem. Maybe the way GMAC measures difficulty has some quirks to it, and under an update to the algorithm these problems would somehow get a different ranking.    Regardless, we don't think there's anything nefarious to all this--there's no reason that GMAC would deliberately mess with our heads. After all, the 10th Edition of the OG, for those of us who go back that far, was comfortably chaotic. It had no order whatsoever. The 11th Edition was the first one that the GMAT folks put in order of difficulty--and we all welcomed that change. It made studying so much more productive to know how hard a problem was to the GMAT, if only in relative terms.    As we find out more on this matter, we'll let you all know.    5. Stay Tuned    More generally, as we dig further into OG13, we'll keep you posted on any juicy discoveries. Again, we don't want to squint too hard at the tea leaves. We'll start seeing things that aren't really there: \\"Is there one more or one less Probability problem, and what signal is the GMAT sending...?\\" That road leads to madness. This OG is pretty much the same as the last one, just with some new good problems in it.    6.

B0063IH60K|3.0|Not a bad App. A good one without any special effects. A good one to help pass some time. Not bad st all!
B004T2QZL8|1.0|Until they fix the force close issue, this game isn't worth it. Crashes at level 40 on HTC EVO 4G.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|i've got a samsung epic 4g. The game ran great for the first 30 or so combinations, but after that it seems to crash/force close as soon as a match is even attempted.<br /><br />id give 4 stars if it was stable, but it is wwwwaaayyyy to unstable to get more than 2 stars
B004LWZW8S|3.0|Heard a lot of comparisons to \\"300\\". The movie falls well short of that. I understand it did quite well at the box office so perhaps my feelings are mine alone. I will be trading the movie for something else in the very near future however or perhaps re-gift it soon.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|Force Close at 36 items. That was a great use of 30 minutes. Could be fun if fixed. Also, allow option to turn off re-matches.
B0078JPCJK|5.0|This show is wonderful! I really enjoyed watching it very week and wish that there was more! If you enjoy a good show about History with bits of romance and war you should enjoy this!
B004T2QZL8|2.0|not good on my kindle fire, force closed after a couple minutes playing, sad, this game looks fun. boo hoo
B004T2QZL8|2.0|i liked it until it became unplayable fix it and I'll love it.<br />it was really fun. update it please!
B004T2QZL8|3.0|yeah started force close after about fifty or so combinations, apart from that great game ...... when they fix the force close issue it will be a super game to wile away the hours
B00785P2QC|5.0|ive definately spent far too many hours playing this game. it is fast paced at first but difficult to continue playing without buying credits.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|Force closes everyone on my Droid razr. Please fix it! I played for fifteen minutes, now it crashes everytime I try to make a new element. Boo.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|its funny how the only recent entry NOT complaining about force closing is someone who knows just about EVERYTHING about the game... I don't like developers who comment and rate up their own apps. HELLO!!! We can see right thru you! why don't you FIX the force close issue instead of pretending it doesn't exist (like the PS people and their dang 3D display... nobody likes them right now cause they got their thumb up their but about their broken product.... don't be like playstation!)
B005MMJ84K|5.0|With the way Delirium ended I knew there would be a sequel, but i was still excited to see that the next book was coming out. Pandemonium was great I love the theme about love being a disease. How creative! This book was great about picking up where the first book left off. It was fast paced and told an exciting story of deception, betrayal, hardship, freedom, and of course love. I enjoyed the characters and the way things panned out. Overall I thought it was a great story. Can't wait for the third book.
0307719774|5.0|This book is beautiful :) I love the idea of having a 5 year journal and it is actually a great looking book and came in great condition. It doesn't cost much considering what you get for it! I would totally recommend this book!
B003F3NEBG|5.0|This Blu-ray edition is so much better than the Special Edition.  The colors are vibrant and the images are sharp.  I have seen this miniseries several times but it was a great pleasure to watch it again in this edition. The bonus features are also more up-to-date.<br /><br />This adaptation of Pride and Prejudice is excellent.  Although I have liked other adaptations of the novel for what they were, this is the definitive one, so far.  The script follows the book fairly well and actually inspires you to reread the novel.<br /><br />The two leads are incomparable.  Most of the supporting actors excel in their portrayals of the characters. It is a joy to watch, over and over.
B005EWDA3I|4.0|This is the first Murakami book(s) I've read and I just couldn't put it down, but like so many good works of literarure I didn't want it to finish either. I just finished it last night and I would recommend all three books to anyone. I'm going to read something completely different now as I did read the three books one after each other, but after that I'll probably read another book of his.
B00701897I|5.0|I passed on this in the theaters not really knowing the story.  Kids really had no interest either.  We sat down this past weekend for family movie night and watched Tintin.  What a great movie, the kids loved it!  The action was superb.  It definitely reminded me the first time I saw Raiders and the thrill of the adventure.  All the characters were likable especially Snowy.  What a hidden treat of a movie.  Certainly would be up for a sequel if made.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|I like this game. However, I could deal with waiting for a content update, but just glad that the FC issue seems to have been resolved. The fact that it worked once and now just force closed took all the Joy out of every Bit of this game....
B006SMLAMQ|2.0|As large as this program is, you would think there would be a desktop widget. Instead, you can either run the program or see your desktop. Very disappointing. Uninstalling.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|Downloaded it, played for 5 minutes and then it started force closing on me over and over and over. I can replicate the force closes every time. Restarting my Kindle changes nothing. Horribly broken piece of software. Doesn't anyone do quality control on the apps of the day?? Don't waste your time with this until it's fixed. Really, don't waste your time with it.
B006X08EZY|5.0|I remember when these two great musicians played Carnegie Hall 8 (eight!) years ago. I don't remember any comments at the time about the session being recorded for a CD. So when I first heard about this release, I was a little cynical, thinking \\"OK, they were both on the Nonesuch label about that time, now neither is, so they're just fulfilling some contractual obligations; maybe I won't buy it just on principle.\\".<br /><br />Fast forward, and it was time to complete another amazon order, and I decided to add it. After all, I have been following both artists for several decades now, and after giving the CD just one spin, any cynicism I may have had got wiped away. Instead, I found myself at several points with goosebumps on my arms, something that has happened with each of them individually over the years.<br /><br />Some might comment that this isn't a very likely collaboration, but it is. Byrne began his exploration of world and African diaspora music way back in the late 70s. Veloso, for his part, is one of the principal architects behind the Tropicalia movement, which, of course, started from the African diaspora perspective, but looked to American and British rock and roll, and blended it all together in a wonderful and thoroughly addictive (or as David Byrne says in the liner notes, \\"down the rabbit hole of Brazilian music\\") psychedelic mix.<br /><br />If you have some familiarity with either or both of these musicians, but may not be aware that they've collaborated together or played each other's songs live over the years, the record will give you new insight into how they complement one another. For those of us who are more than familiar with both, it's another gem to add to the collection.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|this is a fun addicting app, but after getting about 30 creations it force closes whenever I try to make a new element.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|doodle god force closes almost as soon as it's opened. it probably could have been a great game but I guess I will never know....hummed.
1558908323|4.0|A new pathogen has spread through New York City, one that is carried by the common cockroach and affects only children.  An entomologist (Sorvino) creates a mutated insect breed to kill off the cockroaches using a deadly secretion.  This engineered new breed is designed to die off after one generation.  But as a series of bizarre killings take place in and around the sewers and tunnels of the city, it is thought that the insects have evolved and survived...and learned how to mimic human form.<br /><br />For the first time in sixteen years or so, I finally saw this film from start to finish.  I was surprised by its quality and enjoyability.  Now now, I know that the premise is quite shaky but at the same time I find it very original.  There really are insects in nature that are able to mimic the appearance of those that prey upon them.  Could a species do this with humans?  Doubtful, but it's a marvelous point from which to proceed and it yields the modern era equivalent of an \\"atomic horror\\" matinee feature.<br />Mira Sorvino, high off of her Oscar win in 1996 for Mighty Aphrodite, turns in a solid performance in her role as the brilliant scientist.  My only criticism is that I can't imagine that there are a whole lot of entomologists out there as hot as she is but that's Hollywood for you.  I also hadn't realized that Guillermo del Toro directed this film.  Del Toro has directed the Hellboy films and produced The Orphanage.  That latter film had such brisance in its ending...it's no wonder that del Toro is one of film's go-to guys for moody horror.  He certainly gets the job done here.  In fact, I consider one of the hallmarks of good suspense and thrillers to be that I never once get the feeling that each of the main characters will make it out alive.<br /><br />The only downside is that the film does lean a bit upon the \\"we're caught in a dark, confined space and icky bug creatures are after us\\" trope.  That said, it's never enough to be overly distracting or used as a crutch.  If it does then I guess it slid right off of me.  Probably because the idea just captivates my imagination.  Insects that can mimic our form.  Great idea...even if it stretches believability a bit (they have lungs!!)  But isn't that what good science fiction is supposed to do?
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I love this game so much; but I woke up this morning, and I opened this app up, but... THERE WAS A GREEN SCREEN! I tried unzooming, moving around, waiting ten minutes, going to my neighbor's house, and they had a green screen, too. Is it being glitchy? I don't know. But it needs an update A.S.A.P!!<br /><br />Add me-  ID:  Moe2727
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Control suicide birds to overthrow green pigs. If you haven't heard of this game yet, you need to get out more. Silly fun stuff well worth the memory space.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|I just got this app for my kindle fire. its fun and challenging. but when I got around 60 combos it crashed and now it doesn't work. so don't buy this app
B006SMLAMQ|2.0|time doesn't read system time, can't configure it for dst.<br />widgets work for a few clicks then only show 24hr time format.<br />thought this would be a great tablet weather app however, I'm disappointed and removing it.<br /><br />android ics on moto Xoom tablet.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|why must it force close so often? arrgh! if only it didn't. man! so frustrating!  cant do human + egg, or all sorts if other combis!
B004T2QZL8|1.0|the updated version still forces close when you get combo wrong. 5 stars if it worked properly . . .
B004I744AS|4.0|a good dictionary for kindle fire, it works just good. not too much surprise, but it does what you want for a dictionary
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Nicely done take on the mid the elements concept. Works just fine on my Nexus S without any problems. It is a bit slow to load initially, but it's fine once it gets started.
B0049P1VHS|3.0|Basically I thought it'd be better , never read the comics , but once you've seen all of george romeros zombie saga everything else just pales in comparison. It did look to have some promise after seeing the first episode which is the only episode directed by frank darabont , but after that it just got cheesy , with cheesy unrealistic dialougue and some episodes were just borefests, regardless its nice to see something like this on tv there aren't many gory horror series basically none - amc is trying something new which is good / check out Breaking Bad , amc's best series on TV
B004T2QZL8|1.0|game is awesome but it forecloses so much.  it doesn't do that on the ipod fix it and get better reviews its that simple.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|This is a better looking version of Alchemy, which I liked. I was excited to play until the force close error makes it impossible to play on my Kindle fire.  Please fix this!!
B005V20JKI|4.0|1.4.1 Update killed my data. But the game is so awesome, I went back to it, climbed to the top again, and am still playing it. If you haven't played - seriously do, the game is amazing.<br /><br />I am playing on my Nexus One, and the game does lag a bit. It lags a bit when I switch characters, it lags a lot for the bull character, it really lags on the Prince mode when the number of enemies increases and the phone can't compute that. I can't make it past prince because I keep dying repeatedly from the lags. It's a pity though, the game is awesome.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|the game is very fun but the force close makes it un playable. If you want to play it go on the Internet insted.-
0525478817|5.0|This is a truly wondrous novel about young people living with one foot in the grave.  It is the story about two teens with cancer and how that fact affects them, their families, and their friends.  It tackles some of life's biggest questions: what it means to live and to love; what constitutes a valuable life; what constitutes a \\"good\\" death; and inevitably, what is the meaning of life.  The story is told with searing honesty.  It will make you fall in love with the characters, and yes, it will make you cry.  But it will also make you laugh out loud and have you giving thanks for John Green's amazing novel.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|downloaded this app even though reviews were shoddy. haven't had any force close problems. love this game and it looks very nice. well done. hope the bugs can be fixed soon for those experiencing them.<br /><br />running on Samsung GS2
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I am totally addicted to this game especially since the update fixed the force close bug! great app to pass the time and it will give you hours of fun! I would recommend it to anyone! :D
B002QKZLZ6|3.0|not as good as expected, alright for a pouch but after a few month of use it starts to rip. could be better designed, but not bad overall
0062073486|5.0|When you start a mystery novel, you expect to be intrigued. Christie though does it with panache. Her unfailing ability to keep you guessing is her strongest suit. Even when you think you know, when you think you figured it out, she finds a way to thwart your reasoning. Creative license allows an author to twist plots and slip out of tight corners with unreasonable solutions. Not so with Christie. To the very end, she makes it plausible and fluid.<br /><br />A Mistress of Sleuths, never disappointing.<br /><br />An easy read for a stroll if listening or with a cup of tea before a fire. Whichever way you see fit to read this treasure, it will delight you with its simplicity, twists and turns. Don't try to figure it out. Never mind! Do and pit your mind against Christie and see where it gets you. It is not enough to know who it is. You have to find out why it is that person.<br /><br />Happy reading a wonderful story.
0547581033|2.0|The story is great, I would totally recommend this in the regular board book size.  Unless you're reading it to a group of toddlers, there is no need for such a large book (and heavy!).  I should have listened to the other reviews that said it was too big before I bought it.  Wish I would have bought the book in the regular board book size. Live and learn! :)
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved this book. I couldn't put it down. The characters are so vivid and the hardships faced, you end up biting your nails while rooting for the characters who are placed in dire, hopeless situations. Amazingly talented writer!!!!!
B007H7XJD4|2.0|The beginning of movie had me at Awe!!!, then after the first 10 minutes of the movie it always filmed in the dark scene, which is hard to watch any action movie. I thought it would be like the movie \\"300\\", well I was WRONG!!! so I gave it a 2 star, they should of charged $0.99 to watch this movie not worth the $3.99 to watch.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|I don't recommend this app!It keeps fore closing and I can't even play the game.So please don't buy this app.
B001G4C9T4|5.0|Jennifer Hudson has become my new musical obsession, so I automatically wanted to go buy her albums. I saw this one and the price was perfect so I was like ok, I'll give it a go. Got it in great time and flawless condition. Jennifer Hudson's voice is like that of an angel. She has that star quality and power vocals just like many before her Alicia Keys, Aretha Franklin, the late and great Whitney Houston, etc. Her lyrics are meaningful and she gives a great variety of slow and up tempo songs on this grammy award winning album. Worth every penny. A CD you must add to your music collection, I'm sure glad I did.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This is a cool game. It is harder than it looks. There is currently a crash problem but I am sure it will be fixed with next update. This is sort of a puzzle type game and I love this type of a game on phones and tablets.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|Game is very addicting but it keeps force closing! I'm using a kindle fire by the way. please fix this because i I REALLY REALLY wanna play.
1594203334|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  As the mom of a 3 year old and a 1 year old, I enjoy reading \\"parenting\\" books for ideas on how to best raise my kids.  I read this book in an entire weekend.  It was such a good read and kept you engaged throughout.  Although not a parenting manual, I got a lot of information about and enjoyed reading about this family's life in Paris.  It is my goal to have well behaved children, and I think some of the ways Parisians raise their children could help many American families struggling with their own goals.  Definitely would recommend it to any mom out there!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This is an excellent version of Mahjong! I could play this for hours! I've had no issues with this game and it works perfectly. HTC Rezound
B0071XO8RA|4.0|from the first few sentences i could tell that this was going to be a great story.  i did not finish it in one sitting, but when i had to put it down the characters and plot stayed with me...a sign of a well crafted story.  i hope this is not the last we will hear from the silo.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|i played the game on the computer and loved it so when i saw it was avalible for kindle i immediately got it. now it keeps telling me that it needs to &quot;force close&quot;. so flood game if it works.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|First time I tried this it turned on, immediately shut itself off, but the sound continued until I force closed it. The second time it seemed to work except for this god awful clicking noise. It's very loud...much louder than the narrator, &amp; sounds much like a helicopter. Although the noise was making Big Paula howl like a donkey, I put ear plugs in &amp; played around with with it for a bit. After about 5 minutes it froze up completely &amp; I had to force close it again. Paula has now been sobbing all day, &amp; her hero Matt Lauer isn't on to cheer her up.  So, she's been squeezing me to death most of the day. Help, Doodle God! Update your app before my large &amp; in charge woman suffocates me in her bosoms!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|My wife and I enjoyed this SO much. She liked it just as much as FIREPROOFand I thought it was almost as good.
B005723JSQ|5.0|I started out with a sample of this book, after the first 2 pages I could not put it down.<br />I was obsessed with it! I thought it was funny, relatable, and an easy read. It's lke watching a chick flick but better because you get to picture your own characters and read it as fast or as slow as you want! It's so well written and keeps your attention throughout. Best of all it makes you feel as if you are there with these characters.<br />I definitely 100% recommend it. I am so bummed that I am done reading it, I want more!!!
159668139X|5.0|This book is brilliant - for what it is. And it is NOT a book on how to weave good-quality cloth with primitive means (get Rachel Brown's Weaving, Spinning, Dyeing Book). It is NOT a book on rigid heddle weaving either (get Betty Davenport's Hands On Rigid Heddle Weaving). Neither is it the only weaving book you'll ever need - lots of subjects aren't even touched upon, others treated incompletely.<br /><br />Learning to Weave is a beginner's course for four-shaft floor looms (if you don't have at least four shafts, about half of the book will be useless to you). The tone of the book is friendly and accessible, there's often several alternatives for doing things (and reasons given for when which one is better) and I found the descriptions and explanations very clear. I especially love the chapters on weave drafts (with drawing exercises) because it's the first time I've understood how they work. I'm slowly working my way towards the end, but so far I've succeeded in learning how to weave twill variations, double cloth and Bronson lace with only this book to help me.<br /><br />For me the book is pretty much perfect (for what it is - see first paragraph), but I've read on Weavolution that Peggy Osterkamp's \\"Weaving for Beginner's\\" is supposed to be even better...
B004T2QZL8|5.0|The Devs updated Doodle God and I can now play without crashing constantly!  I am looking forward to playing it for a long while to come, it is an entertaing, if frustrating game, since duplicating previous combinations is extremely easy to do and the tracker tracks every combo every time even the duplicates!  This makes it much harder to find new combinations, still fun though!<br /><br />IF you were experiencing the FORCE CLOSE problem, please try the update, it may have been fixed for your device as well.<br /><br />I can only hope that we might get a few more levels in the future, thanks for the prompt update Devs!<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW<br />This app is fun, and I would like to actually play it through, unfortunately it keeps Force Closing on me, which makes it unplayable.  It is an interesting version of Alchemy, an easier to understand version.<br /><br />I hope the instability problems can be fixed so I can enjoy this FAotD.<br /><br />I use an Onda VX610W tablet running Android 2.3 Gingerbread and it usually has no problems running complex HD programs/movies/games.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|Great game until I reached about 27 elements and now I can't play it, it keeps crashing - force close every time I select a second element. It would have been 4-5 starsif it worked. Please fix it...
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Great addition to provided clock alarm.  Very easy to set and read.  Would love to have more options to change sounds.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Splashtop is a good idea that is  well executed.  It has been very useful both at home and at work.  However if the app doesn't find the computer automatically, it is not very clear how to troubleshoot the connection from either end.
0786852550|5.0|The best book I have ever read in my entire life. So good have reread 2 times, worth every single penny!!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Its fun for a while i mean u can do all the combos and stuff, but after a while it gets kind of repetitive. Still fun every now and then though :)
B005UG542S|3.0|I have read the books and was just as disappointed in the movie as I was the final book. It was very sudden and wow the jump. Hmmmmmm I had to see it but wish I had rented it instead of buying.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|it would be a decent game if you can fix the force closures! the rating will go up after these problems are fixed!
B004T2QZL8|1.0|Super fun until the force closes started on my htc vivid please update! Really glad I did not pay for this app since it's pretty much useless now.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Love to read about Seal exploits but this guy presents himself as rather immature and annoying. The book reminds me that these guys are all young though, and elite warriors doing what only the young and strong can do.
B004Q3RDVG|5.0|This was an incredible book. I enjoyed reading it so much there were times I just didn't want to put it down.The story lines and the interconnection between the charcters was spectacular. This is a great novel.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|This is a good game. Unlike Alchemy, if separates the items into groups to make it more organized. Also, the pictures look a lot better; more colorful. Like many people have posted though, it foes force close after some time. I will keep the game for now, but I certainly hope this one issue will be corrected soon.
B005OOSPZO|5.0|Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  I should say \\"please describe accurately...\\".  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />The aspect ratio is 2.35:1 as advertised. Video quality is very, very good, but there is some fine grain in many of the scenes.  Detail is fantastic.  I can't imagine the DVD having even close to the video quality of this Blu-Ray.<br /><br />The DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio sound was good, but disappointing at the same time.  There just wasn't much, if any, surround sound.  I wasn't aware of any noticable sound coming from the surround speakers, but there might have been a little.  There should have been a lot, with all of the planes flying over your head.  Sub-woofer bass, which I think I noticed a little bit, just wasn't strong enough.  But, for an older movie, the sound was pretty good.  There was a lot of stereo separation between the front speakers.<br /><br />The sub-titles were annoying, partially because the movie was 2.35:1, and the first line of the sub-titles were within the movie, and the second line was in the black bar below the movie.  The first line was hard to read at times.  It would have been better if they would have fit all the sub-titles in the black bar.  I don't like sub-titles, and agree that they should make everyone speak English, just to make it easier to enjoy the film.<br /><br />I watched the Japanese Extended version, which was 2 hours and 28 minutes long.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This an updated review. Yesterday there were issues with force closing constantly. I'm very happy to say these issues were quickly addressed by the developer with an update. The game works brilliantly now on my Kindle Fire. This is a very unique and fun game. Quality through and through.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Don't see why its rated so low, especially being the freebie of the day. It all plays rather smoothly, the categories system is far better than alchemy
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Glad I found these stories. They have depth and weight. I could connect with the characters which is always a plus. I look forward to reading more of Mr. Howey's stories.
B005LLSNNE|3.0|The viewing quality is sub standard and very pixalated on a large flat LCD screen. I would not recomend buying a video until this issue is resolved
B003MXGNX0|5.0|this is a great movie. my oldest son rented it, it was easy, convenient and worth it. i recommend it.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|this would be a great app but for the force close issue. so please send an up date. then it soul get a 5 star
B004T2QZL8|5.0|makes any thing you want like a man, woman,book, fish, cool turtles, runners, and ect.  helps you to be a scientist
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like it.  It is fun to pass the time with but is rather erksome some times.  la la la la la.
0920668364|1.0|When my in-laws gave this book to my son as a Christmas gift, I put it on his shelf not thinking anything.  But then I read it.  What a horrible book.  All I could think about is that it would scar him for life with a fear that his parents were going to die.  Shortly thereafter, I put it in the garbage.  I cannot imagine why anyone would give this book to any child. There must be a million better ways to express how much parents love their children.  I thought that I was the only one who felt this way and I couldn't figure out what was wrong with me.  Fortunately, I see that I am not alone in my distaste for this terrible story.  Thank goodness that there are others who have some common sense.
1466401885|2.0|I did not like this book - at all.  Was there a message? What can a YA take away from the story?  I still think Abby and Travis are all wrong for each other.<br />The fight club thing was not appealing.  I just did not like the book - it was unbelievable and not even emotionally engaging. I finished it, hoping at some point it would get better, it did not.  It got so many positive reviews - hmmmmmm, maybe it's , me (Now that is entirely possible)  Just was not my kind of story.<br /><br />P.S. Where were the adults in the story?  Even Charlie Brown eludes to responsible adults...
B004T2QZL8|4.0|It is a lot of fun but it keeps force closing and then you have to restart. Fix the problem and get five stars.
0800141660|5.0|Oh how I wish I could have lived back then (well maybe not), but it certainly seems more civilized in some ways. I received this movie quickly and in good condition and enjoy watching it over and over, simply a beautiful film
B005UDD1R6|3.0|this app DOES work just fine on my kindle fire, but I have one issue. I cannot figure out how to delete anything! I downloaded a couple things twice by accident and cannot figure out how to delete one copy. If anyone can enlighten me on this issue please do.
1582406723|1.0|I have enjoyed the AMC series of TWD so I thought I would try out the comics. Unfortunately, you can buy every volume of TWD for the Kindle....EXCEPT Vol 1! Why would anyone want to start with Vol 2?
B004T2QZL8|2.0|Continues to force close. Please fix. Other than force closing, not a bad game. Great way to kill some time at work.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|It would be a lot better if it didn't force close every time I played...  That is all I have to say about that.
B006SMLAMQ|2.0|Manual locations only, no gps. Looks pretty but these are not widgets. Lots of potential but falls on its face.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|I like the game but crashes constantly.... please fix.  and what's with the twenty word minimum? how is this in the top 5 in the amazon app store with the constant crashing?
B004T2QZL8|3.0|Really fun game. A wonderful and polished rendition of this game concept. BUT JoyBits needs to get in gear and fix the frequent force closes. Once they do that, I'd recommend that anyone buy this game.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have not read work of fiction since my beautiful wife passed away ten months ago. Prior to my wife's death I read between 50 and 100 books a year. I just couldn't get past the first page of anything. Nothing held my attention --- until I somehow stumbled across Wool. It grabbed me from page one and I couldn't stop reading it. Now what am I gonna do? I can't remember a book capturing my me like that since I read A Canticle For Lebowitz or Aztec. Books like this only come around every few decades. Fantatstic!
B004T2QZL8|2.0|great game til it stops working and force closes constantly. HTC incredible 2. so when that fix that I will make review better.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This game is ok.  Kinda short.  I wish it was longer, but what do you expect for a free game.
B006SMLAMQ|2.0|I thought this would have Widgets that you could place on your desktop, but it does not. You need to open the app anytime you want to view the weather. I am not impressed. HTC built in is better.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|Same results as others. Pretty fun, but closes about 20 minutes in. Also, any idea why it needs to read phone calls in permissions?
006197806X|2.0|POSSIBLE SPOILERS<br />Pandemonium by Lauren Oliver is the second book in the Delirium trilogy. This time Lena is out in the Wilds, but without Alex. Not only that, but it seems Alex is dead after he saved her.<br /><br />So, here's the thing, it wasn't like it was horrible but it didn't have much that I really liked about it. I gave the first book, Delirium, a two star review and I liked this book less than that one.<br /><br />-The world building was a bit better in this one, but still not all that great. For some odd reason, I thought they were referring to Portland, Oregon. But apparently, it's for Portland, Maine. Didn't even realize there was a Portland in Maine. (Thank google for the Maine part, otherwise, I wouldn't have known.) It does make more sense, but still, some more world building or explanation would be great.<br /><br />-The story goes back between \\"then\\" and \\"now\\", which took me a bit to get. I wasn't sure what was going on with it. Basically, \\"then\\" is when she first arrived at the Wilds. \\"Now\\" is what's happening now for her. Since the Wilds, she has gone into New York City, undercover almost.<br /><br />While it wasn't a bad idea and it's different, I didn't care for it. I felt like it was spoiling most of the story as we're reading it. She's in the Wilds, but we know she's going to go to New York City. Okay, why do I need to read more?<br /><br />-It seemed that Lena was weaker throughout this novel. Just weak in general, always being knocked out, helpless, etc. It got old after a while. If she's supposed to be so strong, why is she always so weak and complaining she's weak?<br /><br />-The part where Lena has to follow Julian, that just bothered me. It was so obvious that something was supposed to happen and how in the world is Lena able to follow Julian that well? In the middle of a crowded arena where Lena can barely move through people, an attack happens, people are running around like crazy and even walking on her, and she somehow is able to find Julian and follow him. Really?<br /><br />-Then of course, Lena and Julian decide that they fall in love with each other because he shared moments of his cancer and his brother with her and she held his hand. Yep, that's deep love right there. -_- Maybe I missed something and the fact that the guy complains and whines about everything and needs pity, that's why we're supposed to believe that she loves him and want him as a male love interest? I don't think so.<br /><br />-Am I the only one who thinks Julian's peeping of Lena's naked body isn't as sexy or sweet or whatever as Lena thinks it is but is more perverted? That just screams stalker.<br /><br />-Why is Lena so stupid in this book? Was she this stupid in the first one? I don't remember. But things are obvious that it's a set up, that she's supposed to go with Julian for a reason, but she doesn't get it. She doesn't even get that she has weapons to escape with her. Yet Raven and Tack think she can handle it without knowing anything and are surprised that she doesn't get it.<br /><br />-The whole thing was more predictable. From the fact that Julian and Lena will \\"fall in love\\" despite their hatred for each other, because they're in the same room. To the fact that Alex really isn't dead and comes back right at the end. Yeah, we all know Alex isn't dead. Now we get a love triangle in the middle of it as well.<br /><br />I really really hate love triangles. Can't stand them. Now, Delirium has a love triangle so it can be just like every other book out there. Seriously, there is no need for EVERY book to have a love triangle. Just saying. And this one seems pointless and stupid. I feel that Lauren is just trying to get people to do those \\"team\\" things, which sounds like Twilight and there's no need to.<br /><br />-It also seemed like there was no flow or connection for a few things. Like, towards the end of the \\"THEN\\" section, the Scavengers come and start a fight, but all of that is so random and not explained all that well. And suddenly from that, they go into New York City and decide to go \\"undercover\\"? How? Why? What's the motive? There's no reason for them to do that, no explaination, except it just happens and we're expected to believe it. Also, that whole fight thing, is just random and doesn't make any sense. All of a sudden they're waiting for them? Yet, though there's more Scavengers, Lena and her group wins? It's just...<br /><br />Honestly, it wasn't all that great. I was able to read it quickly, but it wasn't a very interesting read, it was boring and I didn't feel like finishing it several times. It's becoming too clich&eacute;d and too predictable. There's nothing really exciting or making it stand out anymore. The writing isn't even all that good anymore. I almost feel like giving this a one star review, but I don't think it quite deserves that. More like a one and a half stars rating, but I'll put two stars here.<br /><br />I'm not really recommending this book or the series right now and I don't think I'll read the next book. I'm just not feeling motivated to do so.lained all that well. And suddenly from that, they go into New York City and decide to go \\"undercover\\"? How? Why? What's the motive?

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have loved using this app.  I've been able to read God's Word like never before.  I can read whenever I have a few moments.  I recommend everyone to get this app.
B002BU0DPE|3.0|I received these headphones for Christmas and I've played games for awhile but never using a headset. So I was pretty pumped to check them out and after figuring out the wired setup I got to playing and realized how much of a difference they make. The sound was incredible for Skyrim but where the real difference was in MW3. I could be shooting one direction and hear someone coming from behind me with enough time to get the better of them. Now for the cons, after playing for a while the headset can get a little irritating but after a short brake there back to normal. Now for the biggest problem after  only 2 months the right ear starting going in and out that's when I realized there was something loose inside the volume controller. After going in and out for awhile both ears stopped working and I had to get It fixed and had no idea where I send it. Overall a very good wired headset  with amazing sound and easy controls but not very good if your going to be taking them places, because it causes the sound problems. Also my brother has the astro a30 and they have better sound depth and the chat volume is handy for cod.
B005SDB6RK|5.0|Some super dope video shots. Nutty lines. Sick launches. Just as good, if not better, than TITA. Even the helicopter pilots stunt!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really like this app. I mean 121 games for free? Why not?!? These games are really pretty cool and although some pf the graphics look like they belong on the 1997 version on Windows, it is really fun. Good time waster too.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|i liked the book and i think that SMeyers needs some credit for it she did a good job.<br /><br />i liked the wedding and honeymoon the most they were both beautiful.<br /><br />i want the twilight books and movies to keep going i loved every single twilight book and movie.<br /><br />good job SMeyers they were great i loved it!!!
B004T2QZL8|2.0|fun until combined 34 elements. now force closes with every click. great game while it works. fix fix fix fix.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|I was having fun with this game until it kept force closing on me. Does the same thing on my boyfriend's phone. Seems like it would be great. Oh and that clicking noise is annoying too. It's a shame. I was looking forward to a new alchemy game.
0321525655|3.0|The book itself is good you do a lot of ppt presentations. It has a few good pointers, and some obvious ones as well.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|I love this game. I think it is a lot of fun and I was really excited to see it as a free app of the day. BUT after playing for about 30 minutes it force closed and now any combination I try to make causes it to force close so I can't play at all. I will give 5 stars when it works right again. I have a Samsung galaxy phone.
B004FOA84A|4.0|I'm new at these games &amp; i'm stuck!  I need hints!  Ugh<br />what way r the birds turned? I'm getting frustrated...  Add hints for the novices.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|love this game but please fix. it started forcing close on my kindle fire once I reached about 30 elements and 7 catergories. this is happening when I have opened two things to make a new item. when I click the second element it forces closed. thanks
B006SMLAMQ|2.0|Beautiful graphics that must be opened everytime you want to see it.  would be much more usefully as a desktop widget that coiuld be seen automatically  on start-up and as needed as an home screen info center.  Nice, but uninstalling.  Sorry
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Not sure what all the fuss is about.  This app runs great and the UI is much better than many other similar games.  The intro is a little lame, but the game itself is really good. HTC MyTouch 4G and HP Touchpad running android 4.0.3
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The.app is easy to use and offers a variety of Bible versions.  I like the reading plans and the ability to share passages.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|This movie is straight up racist. It always has been. Seeing it in blue ray makes me see the racism is a clarity I have never experienced before. Julie Andrews is basically a skinhead
B003L77G10|1.0|This season did not play all the way through....it kept skipping and there was nothing on the disk. some of the shows would play and some of them would not, so we ended up missing a huge part of what is going on.<br />I would not buy from this buyer if you like watching all of the shows.
0307592731|5.0|Raw, honest, compelling in spite of how strange this young woman seems to me. The book starts off with her issues with heroin and sex... I'm not easily shocked, but she does it.  She seems so young and yet already did so much in an almost random way. But as it goes on the story of the hike and the misery and joy of it, the observations of the land as she hikes and the various fears and troubles; I can relate to her experiences, they ring true, and I wish I knew I could meet that kind of challenge. Highly readable, can't-put-it-down.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|new kindle fire User and this app is the greatest has all my south Jersey and Phila stations plus police and fire
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a really cool game, its the best game I have ever played. you should really try it is really a cool game
B004T2QZL8|4.0|I didn't have an issue with it force closing. Maybe deleting and downloading again would help. I also don't like that it allows you to do the same combos again. other than that pretty cool.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|They did a new update today! Fixed crashing bug!  I LOVE this game, but the crashing was a little excessive.  In light of being free app of the day, they sent in an update that fixed crashing, so it is a must have!
B00004XMTJ|5.0|[[ASIN:B00004XMTJ Cats: The Musical (Commemorative Edition)]]<br />I loved the play and now love the DVD version. The entire musical score is fast paced and will make you want to get up and dance. The choreography is great. The cast is so talented. A must for all lovers of musicals as well as cat lovers.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great game, and the best part is that the game is free, an amazing time killer and every game is different so you would never get tired of it
B004T2QZL8|2.0|i really like it! but it started off great, then kept force closing on kindle fire everytime I went to create something. please fix!!
1589944607|5.0|My wife and I just started Battlestar Galactica (the show) a couple months ago via Netflix. I also have been getting into deeper board games than the Monopoly/Battleship/Outburst variety. After looking at reviews and looking at what the game provided, BSG the board game looked like a perfect match for our play interests. We were not disappointed. BSG comes with a hefty rule book because it is a complex game. All features are relevant, however, and also help immerse players in the theme of this game. Speaking of theme, players who know the TV show will find themselves making connections to events from the series. It is not a prerequisite to watch the TV show as nothing is spoiled, but it does help.<br /><br />To summarize this complex game I will say that players are divided into two teams, Humans/Cylons. Cylons players are kept secret and their job is to stealthly sabotage human attempts to survive in the journey to Kobol. This is done through a number of different gameplay elements which provides Cylons with multiple opportunities for sabotage. The game takes 2-3 hours which is my biggest complaint about BSG. The 2-3 hours is mostly made up of discussion/arguing as players are frequently accusing each other be being Cylons. Each game plays out fairly differently. Some may be peaceful political games, others take the appearance of full blown wars. Usually, humans fail to meet their objectives and therefore lose, but suprisingly, each game is a lot of fun because of the journey the team of players takes.<br /><br />I highly recommend BSG the board game. It includes so many elements of a great/deep game while also appealing especially to fans of a great TV show.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|Yes it froze on initial start.  After restart, worked fine.<br /><br />Not really seeing a purpose, but it does seem well built and have great graphics AFTER a system restart.
1401937519|5.0|I've been on a quest to figure out as much as I can about the afterlife ever since I lost my teenage son. I search books, videos, blogs, etc., to read about NDE's in particular, since it gives me a glimpse of what my child might have experienced and continues to experience. Late one night, as I was scanning YouTube for NDE's (yeah, I do that!) I found an interview with Anita Moorjani. I was blown away. The healing she had after the NDE solidified the truth of what she experienced and learned while in a spiritual consciousness state.  I couldn't wait for her book and eagerly read it when it came out and pre-ordered several copies for gifts. Everyone I've given it to has had a similar reaction to mine -- simply amazing.<br /><br />Anita has the medical science test results which prove the miraculous healing after she awoke from her coma.  The test reports and results are not photocopied and detailed at length in the book, but if you doubt her sincerity and want to read medical reports prior to believing her story, then you may visit her website and you'll find she offers up as much as possible in the way of medical evidence, (videos and radio interviews with doctors, etc.) Needing this physical proof reminds me of the doubting Thomas in the Bible.  Thomas would only believe it was really Jesus if he could see and feel the physical marks.<br /><br />I've read many, many miraculous healings during my lifetime, as I seek them out whenever I can. It is easy to see that Anita is speaking truthfully from the heart and has written this book to help others.  Her motive is pure and she tries to word her experience to stay true to what she experienced instead of slanting it with any particular religious or personal/ego driven view.  Even when she is being interviewed, you can hear the hesitation in her voice as she tries to find the correct words to convey the message without tainting it with any personal interpretation.  I truly appreciate her efforts to keep her experience true to how she understood the event.<br /><br />If this is your first time reading about the afterlife or an NDE, get ready to expand your mind beyond what the physical senses are dictating.  If you think this limited physical life is all that exists, you may not be able to glean all the lessons in store for you in Ms. Moorjani's writing.<br /><br />Self-love is a big message in her book. At first glance, it may seem a rather selfish way of living.  Do what feels good to you--Anita challenges us to view this message from a DEEPER perspective than just a surface view which will, of course, appear selfish.  A deeper view makes you question, how can one truly love another without loving themselves first? And, how will you know what your life's passion is all about, if you don't know what makes you feel good?  Question your motives, your intents--the real reason you're doing something. Learn what is shallow, selfish, and material driven.  And, learn what is joyous, pure, and love driven. If it's your purpose to be your true self here in this lifetime, as Ms. Moorjani suggests, then we had better get in touch with that \\"true\\" self.<br /><br />I personally thank Anita Moorjani for the courage it takes to write such a personal account.  I hope she knows how many people she is helping and comforting. I trust she will be able to deflect the few negative or doubting comments written about her experience, since she knows what happened to her is true. I recently had the pleasure to listen to Anita share her experience at a seminar in California.  Her humbleness and sincerity were more than apparent.<br /><br />We're all heading the same direction --basically no one is getting outta' here 'alive'.  Keep an open mind and you'll appreciate the wonderful journey Anita Moorjani experienced and has so lovingly shared in her writings. Thank you, thank you, thank you, Anita, for sharing your story. It has brought a lot of comfort to me personally, as I imagine my dear, sweet son being in such a loving environment as you described. Continue to live fearlessly!n such a loving environment as you described. Continue to live fearlessly!

B006ZCWU5K|2.0|As a long time fan of the Boss, I found this Cd thin in material and delivery. Appears Springsteen has gotten away from the story telling power ballads that made him famous amoungst his fans. I was looking forward to attend a concert on the new tour but after listening to this CD a few times, think I'll reconsider.

Her best friend Kate was also annoying, but I simply loved Christian in all his shades.<br /><br />For anyone who doesn't know, this book involves controversial sexual acts and is therefore not for those who object to these practices, even for consenting adults.

B000056OBA|4.0|Beethoven Symphonies 1 - 9. Berliner Philharmoniker and the Wiener Singverein. With Gundula Janowitz, Waldemar Kmentt, Hilde Rossel-Majden and Walter Berry. Conducted by Herbert von Karajan. Recorded 1962 to 1963. Deutsche Grammophon Gesellschaft.<br /><br />This cycle is a classic. Taken as a whole it is very impressive, but I think in general Karajan made  interpretations of more depth in his 1970s cycle. However, there is a ruggedness and vitality to these recordings that he didn't quite capture in the later cycle. I think this is more representative of Karajan's more ferocious conducting that characterised some of his earlier recordings (hence my title of the 'firebrand' years). The later priority is for seamless and beautiful playing which has its own reward.<br /><br />Here is my own response to each interpretation:<br /><br />No. 1: A beautifully polished and thoughtfully paced reading. Karajan does not rush this symphony. Indeed, this is perhaps one of the most concentrated performances on record of the First Symphony.<br /><br />No. 2: Very good - quite homogenous playing.<br /><br />No. 3: This version of the Eroica is one of the high-points of this celebrated cycle. It combines urbanity (in outstanding playing typical of the Berliners) with a good deal of ruggedness. The four movements never seem glossy or artificial and the playing is quite driven throughout. The second movement is played superbly, but perhaps a little less convincing and 'deep' than Karajan's even greater analogue recording from the seventies, which is even more powerful. Tempi are broad in this recording, whilst Karajan's later version is much faster.<br /><br />No. 4: This is one of the highlights of the cycle, with exceptionally lush and atmospheric conducting. The sound is incredibly vivid on both LP and CD.<br /><br />No. 5: This interpretation has an irresistible vitality to it. Whilst I would prefer a rugged and tragic view with slow tempi for the first movement, the last three movements of this work really come alive in Karajan's hands. What really stands out from the beautiful playing of the orchestra is the horn playing which is quite forceful at times. At the end of the day though, I would appreciate a little more dynamic contrast in the finale. Still, a very enjoyable Fifth.<br /><br />No. 6: The 1962 Pastoral received such a bad and enduring press that Karajan has never really been associated with the symphony ever since. This is despite a broader and more complete Sixth in the 1970s. Still, this recording was the first to which I really 'listened' and, despite the critics, I find it a very dramatic and beautifully taut reading, not 'overly' taut as the Penguin suggests. The orchestra shows incredible verve and power in the storm sequence and the piercing tone of the piccolo in that movement alone is worth hearing for the awesome playing of the instrument.<br /><br />No. 7: What a fantastic performance of the Seventh this is - very intense, dramatic and the finale really bounces along as it should.<br /><br />No. 8: This is a rhythmically pointed, wonderfully played account. Absolutely charming.<br /><br />No. 9: The 1963 recording is a famous interpretation of this endlessly amazing work. It receives a very dramatic, if overly aggressive at times, reading under Karajan at this stage in his career. However, the finale really blossoms (enhanced by fantastic singing by the tenor Waldemar Kmentt and baritone Walter Berry, Janowitz is also beautiful, if sounding a little stretched by the high writing). In the last part, however, I felt the recording had a touch of routine and the final bars don't have the visceral excitement that they should.<br /><br />Overall, then, a very fine cycle and a famous achievement which deserves a place in every serious record collector's collection. It is also a solid representation of each Beethoven symphony - perhaps even qualifying as a a reference set. First time collectors will be particularly well served. But I don't think it's Karajan's best Beethoven cycle. The 1977 cycle is its superior in many important respects. Buy both and decide for yourselves!ed.

B001KVZ6LQ|5.0|I own both the DVD Collector's Edition and the blu-ray versions. Watching both versions back-to-back I do see that the blu-ray version is better in that the brightness of the picture is more consistent, there's less flickering, less jumpiness, and graininess, while still there, is smoother. Is this enough to spring for the blu-ray? That's up to you. If I only had $20 I would just buy the DVD Collector's Edition (with the tin and the Son of Kong and Might Joe Young movies). But if you're a true Kong fan, this blu-ray version will give you the best version out there and is worth having. I had some problems with the blu-ray menus, but I think it must be my old blu-ray player. When I put the disc in a newer machine the menus worked fine.<br /><br />Quick update (3/21/12): I updated the firmware on my old blu-ray player (over 3 years old) and the blu-ray menus work now. However, be warned that the highlighted option in the menus is not very distinguishing from the non-highlighted options. You have to look closely to see which menu option is chosen, especially when selecting closed caption or one of the special features.

B003S0IJWA|4.0|Beethoven Symphonies 1 - 9. New York Philharmonic Orchestra and Julliard Chorus. With Martina Arroyo, Norman Scott, Regina Sarfaty and Nicholas di Virgilio. Conducted by Leonard Bernstein. Recorded from 1962 to 1969. CBS/Sony.<br /><br />(Please note: this review is only for the recordings of Beethoven: Symphonies 1-9).<br /><br />****<br /><br />Bernstein's first cycle with the New York Philharmonic is thoroughly powerful and deeply committed. Almost all of the performances are enjoyable and Bernstein's way with this great music is distinctive. The individual performances range from transcendent musical experiences to ordinary takes. Yet Bernstein's firm vision of each of these works merits hearing. The one major disappointment is the Ninth. Whilst Bernstein secures some taut and dramatic playing, the choral and solo singing is poor. Unfortunately, the Julliard Chorus do not meet the demands of their task and none of the four soloists sing well, make any lasting impression, or blend well as a quartet. In particular, the tenor sounds like he is going to explode in the high register. He sounds like a Wagnerian tenor who has just returned from singing Tristan and Tannhauser in one day. Bernstein's speeds are also a little fast in the finale and some of the great moments in this masterpiece are obscured as a result. Additionally, the orchestral playing in the finale is less impressive than earlier on.<br /><br />However, in the Fifth Symphony, Bernstein scores one of the truly inspired interpretations of his career. This is Beethoven playing from another world: to say that I was moved by this performance is an understatement. Critics would dismiss this interpretation as eccentric and I suppose it is Bernstein's slow tempi that are responsible for that rebuke. I found that these speeds present more vividly the drama and stamping force of Beethoven's great creation. The tempos also allow the anguish and pathos to be so vivid. The so called 'fate motif' has rarely been expressed with such force and clarity. In terms of instrumental balance, the timpani gets a fabulous showing and those menacing strokes all through the first movement are electrifying. The horns in the third movement have a great spaciousness around them. The whole work is a tribute to the engineers, the New York Philharmonic and especially Bernstein. The interpretation has an upward thrust to it: the menacing despair of the first movement moves inexorably towards a final joyful outburst. This is one of my favourite recordings: a desert island disc indeed.<br /><br />The other works here receive generally good performances. The Pastoral is unusually fierce and dramatic, which is refreshing, although the piccolo is obscured in the storm sequence and it is such a delightful touch that it seems empty without it. This is a minor point perhaps. The Seventh is deeply impassioned, very much in the line of the Fifth: the string playing is particularly good in the first movement. However, the one interpretation for which Bernstein's early cycle is renown that was less convincing to me is the Eroica. This is one of his most famous records and has a strong following. However, I found it to be a fairly routine take on a revolutionary work. There was nothing wrong with the recording, I just found that there was nothing truly outstanding. Solti and Karajan both score massively in this symphony due to a combination of polish, respect for the quiet as well as the boisterous, and finely judged tempi. The Second, Fourth and Eighth are all magnificent, the Fourth in particular is outstandingly atmospheric and exciting.<br /><br />In general, this cycle is a fine one and I seem to come back to it time and again, constantly intrigued by the way Bernstein has something different to say in most of these great symphonies. I should add a comment about the outstanding work of the New York Philharmonic here. Whilst I suppose it goes without saying that they would put in good performances in such repertoire, they even surpass their European counterparts on occasion with the playing often reaching dizzying heights (again, that breathtaking Fifth is proof positive). Finally, the recording is excellent throughout, beautifully transparent, spacious and there is not a touch of dryness or tape hiss. Recommended with vigour. The only reason I don't rate it a full five starts is because of a poor Ninth and my disappointing reaction to his Eroica.h repertoire, they even surpass their European counterparts on occasion with the playing often reaching dizzying heights (again, that breathtaking Fifth is proof positive).

B0071XO8RA|3.0|After reading another Omnibus apocalyptic sci-fi adventure that was 10x what this was, I was anxious to get into another exciting book. I read the reviews of this one and was excited to buy it. That being said, the first of the book started off good; however, it took its own sweet time building up to any adventure or excitement. I got about 75% into the book. I kept hoping it would get better, but I couldn't finish it. I had other books begging to be read, that are a lot more interesting than this one. Maybe if I had read this one PRIOR to Yesterday's Gone, I would of liked it (doubtful). But nothing compares. That's the bad thing about a REALLY good book...finding others that compare, vs settling for mediocre.

B000T9QF8S|5.0|Beethoven Symphonies 1 - 9. Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus. With Pilar Lorengar, Stuart Burrows, Yvonne Minton and Martti Talvela. Recorded 1972 to 1975. Decca/London.<br /><br />There is something delightful to be found in almost every corner of Sir Georg Solti's first cycle with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. I find it bizarre that this cycle never seems to get the rave reviews it deserves. I, for one, would rate it as the best. Individually, his interpretations may not suit all tastes for various reasons (personally, his Fifth does not attain the incredible heights it can). Overall, however, there is a vitality to these performances that is most rewarding. I found every single performance in some way revelatory. Part of this is Solti's gift for bringing out orchestral detail as well as his passion and genuine feeling for dynamics. Overall, this remains the most satisfying cycle I have yet acquired (in comparison with Bernstein's 1960s cycle, Karajan's 1960s and 1970s cycles, the Norrington and Harnoncourt cycles).<br /><br />Here is my response to each interpretation:<br /><br />Nos. 1 and 2: This is a buoyant and totally endearing recording of the First Symphony. The rhythms sparkle and the percussion is bouncy. Both 1 and 2 in this cycle are handled with nice playing and tempos that are just right.<br /><br />No. 3: This remains my favourite interpretation amongst a strong list of contenders. Solti's tempi may surprise some - they are not fierce, but impassioned. The orchestra seem to love every moment of this wonderful symphony and every movement seems just about right. What is uniform throughout is a strong sense of mystery and power, with strongly articulated timpani and especially magnificent playing from the brass and strings. The scherzo is the best rendering I have heard of this particular movement, especially because it has a genuine scherzo feeling, rather than a glossed over, grandiose one. Best of all is a rapturous and deeply committed rendering of that magnificent adagio.<br /><br />No. 4: The cycle moves along to yet another surprising and continuously captivating interpretation. In particular, the second movement in this Fourth is beautiful, quite enchanting. As with the other recordings in this cycle, the orchestra continue to be buoyant and full of life. One of the best Fourths.<br /><br />No. 5: Solti's Fifth has strong contrasts and some of his ideas are excellent. Overall though, it just doesn't come off like some other strong individual interpretations. But the concept of the playing (especially in the percussion and brass) is very strong.<br /><br />No. 6: This is a lovely and strong account of the Pastoral. It is quite lively and the tempi match it - the merriment of the symphony is very much underlined. Still, the storm sequence is powerful too (although that piccolo could be more pronounced amidst the clamour of the thunder).<br /><br />No. 7: This is one of the highlights of a consistently enjoyable cycle. Solti, as with the other symphonies, brings out so many orchestral colours in this score and the results are very enjoyable. Tempi are generally broad, surprisingly so in the finale. Whilst this recording doesn't quite have the taut and knife-edged drama with sharp contrasting joy (a symphony of light and shade if ever there was one), it still ranks as one of the best for its exploitation of various orchestral colours. As with the rest of the cycle, Solti excels as a master of orchestral detail and it is often surprising to hear instruments stand out in parts which are at other times glossed over.<br /><br />No. 8: This is a fairly delightful account and Solti observes the dynamic contrasts astutely.<br /><br />No. 9: If it wasn't for Furtwangler's incredible 1951 Bayreuth recording, which is a transcendent listening experience, this would rank as my absolute favourite interpretation of the Ninth. This is an overwhelming, deeply felt performance with high energy and genuine pathos. Every movement is laid out with extraordinary care and the tempi are rarely rushed. The recording tends to be in the Furtwangler camp as a whole, the drama of the piece is almost bursting out of the speakers. It makes an immediate contrast with such interpretations as Karajan's 1963, which sounds tame and overly refined by comparison. Best of all, the quartet of soloists is gorgeous and very well balanced in the recording (no one is blocked out and Lorengar, Burrowes, Minton, Talvela are all heard to maximum effect). The Chicago Chorus, Orchestra, the soloists and Solti all triumph here, giving their all in a glorious, heartfelt performance. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Overall, this cycle is truly the most consistent I have yet found. Solti has clearly thought out each and every symphony in great detail and there is so much to enjoy throughout. Even though individual performances are eclipsed in other cycles, the overall quality of these recordings is unsurpassed.<br /><br />I should add that this set includes some of Beethoven's greatest overtures as well (Egmont, Leonore III and Coriolan).

B007M6P01O|5.0|Already establishing itself as one of the best written and produced shows on TV, The Walking Dead ended Season 2 in fine form with a tour de force of gripping action sequences, dramatic set pieces and most importantly the final move from the farm to the prison.<br /><br />Rick finally drops his nice-guy-mister-policeman routine and tells everyone to put up or shut up, squarely setting the tone for what lies ahead. A couple of major characters meet their demise and overall it feels like the cast has been resharpened to eliminate the less interesting characters and enable the more engaging ones to take up more screen time.<br /><br />Personally, I couldn't have hoped for a better finale. This season at times became stuck at the farm and wallowed in the Rick-Shane love triangle story - the finale put these issues behind us and showed that the writers have plenty more material ahead.
B003L77GG0|5.0|I am only writing this review now because I was overseas when the last season aired on television, so I i've only now finished watching it. The show over it's ten years was great. While some say season ten might not be the best, I think every season had it's ups and downs. The only things I didnt like about season ten was Chole kept dissapearing for a few of the episodes, and we didnt get to see any of the Justice league guys come back for another team episode. All the returns of the past characters was great and it really helped the show have a nice conclusion. The finale as a whole was amazing. I had to watch it twice on my rental disc. Such a tear jerker and epic finish. Though they didnt show clark just standing around and talking in the suit, they showed him in it and flying which everyone has wanted since the show began. I started watching this show when it came out in 2001 and its hard to believe that it's actually over. I wish they would make a straight to dvd movie of it, but that's probably only wishful thinking. Either way, I will get the complete set on blu ray whenever it comes out and watch the whole show again many times over. Thanks Tom Welling and company for such a beautiful story of superman...now if they only get the new Snyder supes film right, I wont have to be sad that this show isn't still on the air!
B000001G6W|5.0|This recording of the Ninth is widely celebrated and sometimes ranked as the best version Karajan offered (the Penguin, for example). I haven't heard all of his recordings of this symphony, but would agree that, in comparison with his 1963 version, this is much better. I also agree that it is one of the great Ninths. Karajan is never just routine in this recording, he always surprises you with great lush playing alternating with fast and biting tempos. The finale is particularly impressive: the playing is just tremendous. The lovely passages at the end of the third movement are hauntingly beautiful and the first two movements are exciting, whilst not sacrificing genuine feeling. This is all capped off by a very successful quartet of soloists. Jose van Dam really deserves highest praise and he never sounds strained. This part isn't easy to pull off, so he's work is notably impressive. Tomowa-Sintow is completely different to Janowitz, but sounds just as good. Baltsa has that distinctive voice to offer and Schreier's performance is satisfactory but nothing more. Overall, it ranks third for me in the list of Beethoven Ninth recordings: the Furtwangler 1951 performance at Bayreuth and Solti's 1972 version reach Olympian heights. But that doesn't take away from Karajan's achievement here, which definitely deserves five stars.
B004EPZ084|5.0|Kevin Spacey,Jennifer Aniston and Colin Ferrell give fabulous performances about three horrible bosses.

After decades of hard work and dedication, they find themselves used or forgotten for long overdue promotions they worked so hard for.<br /><br />It is series of funny situational comedic scenes that will lift your spirits.  This movie belongs in a class of its own but in may be considered a fair rival to the famous classic \\"Office Space\\"  I watched it over the weekend and loved it from start to finish.

This show puts me on a roller-coaster of emotions in just one episode I cry, I laugh, I cheer (for Ezra and Aria), and i also get really mad. This show has been one of the greatest tv shows that i have seen in the longest time and i have been watching it since episode 1. I don't think many people would be disappointed in the show if they actually sit down and watch it from season one. It is a show that fills all my need, scary, funny, intense, mind-blowing, confusing and makes me think all the time. And they don't just leave leave you with a cliffhanger leave leave you with a Mount Everest hanger. this is the greatest show i can not express my love for it enough and i think everyone should give it a huge chance cause it will definantly not let you down.

I couldn't tell you.<br /><br />I've owned this two disk dvd set for about 4 years, rocked the household w' it many times and still have yet to watch the second disc.<br /><br />Follows the bands various shows in chronological order (done right). Includes rare TV performance appearances and of course stage shows.<br /><br />First disk is Bon, second is Brian. No disrespect to Mr. Johnson but I'm a Bon fan myself. My opinion...the money you pay is well worth first disk alone...
B001794FOK|2.0|The idea of this movie is interesting but the story was bored you can easily expect what is going to happen next. I wish some other director films this with different story.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Works great on the Galaxy Tab 10.1. Not an easy game but I like a game that makes you think.
0385738773|3.0|Overall -- 3 stars:<br />--------------------<br />Note: This review does contain some spoilers.<br /><br />The book was not inspired the way the first book in the series was -- novel world, hard-hitting action and it made you ask questions.  The third book in the trilogy is there to close out the story arcs quickly and cleanly.  The world is failing which is predictable in a plague/contagion type scenario where there is any contect between infected and immune.<br /><br />The writing is ok, not great and not bad.  The pacing in the story was well done for the most part.  The ending escape sequence seemed like a bit of a movie shot letting you look at all the cool environments and ideas from the first book.  Also, the arbitrary deaths of characters is fitting but it a big of a downer and seems to reenforce the main point.  The main point being that 'Bad things happen to some people and not others.  There is no big plan and there is no salvation, just arbitrary luck of the draw.'  It is a down way of expressing what Douglas Adams did with the number 42 in 'The Hitchhiker's guide to the universe'....think pips and you will figure it out.<br /><br />The characters were fairly static, not much development.  The range of Thomas was a bit odd given what the other characters implied he did before losing his memory as a key member of WICKED.<br /><br />If you can get the book used or a get a cheap download and you have read the other books, you should finish out the trilogy.<br /><br />World setting -- 4 stars:<br />--------------------------<br />The maze, glade and supporting environments were well done and creepy.  The items added so you how close the end of the human race is near.<br /><br />Writing -- 2.75 to 3 stars:<br />---------------------------<br />The writing style was very similar to the other books in the series.  I do have to agree with some of the reviewers about the need for an editor to go back and do a bit of work.  The writing style is tight and to the point.  There are not a lot of flower descriptions but enough allusions to current horror and story elements that the book makes sense.  In 20 years, the book will not work as well.<br /><br />Characters -- 2.5 stars:<br />-------------------------<br />The characters were ok.  Newt was actually one of the most interesting characters and his was more of foil than anything else.  Thomas was not as decisive as I would have hoped.
B006SMLAMQ|3.0|this app is unfortunately too big for its purpose.  it is nice and it does tell you the weather but it's a really big download and their aren't any widgets to use on it.
0062060554|5.0|I really liked the concept of Before I Go to Sleep since it reminded me a lot of the movie Memento. The book gets right to the point at the beginning and never really slows down. A very impressive debut for S.J. Watson.<br /><br />Before I Go To Sleep is aided by an incredibly moving protagonist. Christine is hardly your typical damsel in distress. She's a victim of circumstance, but you feel for her because you care about her. Watson takes the time to establish Christine as a likable character, something that can be easier to do in movies than in books.<br /><br />Psychological novels can be really hit or miss these days. Often times, they dig deeper and deeper into the realm of ridiculousness to find entertainment value. Before I Go to Sleep stays on the surface by sticking with what the audience really cares about, the character.<br /><br />I highly recommend Before I Go to Sleep. It's rare to find a psychological novel that people who aren't into the study of psychology can enjoy. I don't know that much about psychology but I had a lot of fun with this one.
B0063IH60K|4.0|lots of fun. many hour of enjoyment. pop ups should stop after so many times. it is a must if you like Solaire.
0143038419|1.0|I was extremely disappointed when I read this book I expected so much more then what I received between these pages. This is nothing but a story of a selfish, spoiled rich girl who cares of nothing, and nobody but her self. Plus in the real world most women have lives, family, children or don't have the money to just pick up and travel the world. I would not recommend this book to anyone. But there is one book I would especially recommend [[ASIN:B007L8DYYI What is Love?]]
B000AOEMXM|5.0|all the negative reviews are from prima-donnas that cry when their expectations were not met. we live in a society where everything is supposed to be done super-fast and perfect. all the ducks have to be lined up perfectly.everything must be perfect-including this review.there are glitches in these 4 seasons with play-back and audio. so what! get your money back and shut-up you whiners.do you work your job perfectly? are you a model citizen? is your morality up to par? take the big beam out of your eye (fix your conscience , then you will see clearly to take the small fraction of error out of others eyes - their conscience ).i have throughly enjoyed enterprise, and find no fault in script writing or elsewhere.live long and prosper, enterprise.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|I was really starting to enjoy this app when it did the force close on element 35. I really wish they fix this cause its neat...in a weird way.

B0032CVAQQ|5.0|The 5 Love Languages is a great book after the first few pages I was hooked and I knew it was going to be a useful tool in my relationship with my wife. This book is very simple and basically all the information is right in front of you every day but it's the way it's said that really helps you. You should really look at this book as well if you enjoyed this read I highly recommend it [[ASIN:B007MFFAY2 At Last!

B0027BOL4G|3.0|There are millions of us that eat industry food and its working well enough. 'Mericans ain't got time for running around to farmers markets, getting run over by elderly folks. Any HFCS product is better than the crap we were eating in 2000bc.
1741798981|4.0|It has a map you can pull out and stick in your purse (score one point over Rick Steves') - however DK has a better pullout map that is laminated and more durable.  Plus the Lonely Planet tube map is TINY.<br /><br />This book has maps of certain attractions, and for the most part I like them a little better than the comparable maps in other books. For example, their map of the British Museum is much better than Rick Steves'.  The DK map of the same attraction is MUCH more detailed, with colors etc -- but at the same time it is more confusing having so much information on two pages.<br /><br />There are lots of great full-color pictures.<br /><br />The book seems incomplete or it has errors.  For example a restaurant is pointed out on the Bloomsbury map that sounds interesting (Diwana Bhel Poori House) - there is a reference to check page 113 for more information.  Page 113 actually has restaurants in Westminster.  Page 114 has restaurants in Bloomsbury, but makes no further mention of the restaurant I was interested in.  I have come across this sort of inconsistency a few times.<br /><br />The book makes a big note of \\"Top Sights\\", but I'm not sure they have the same taste I have (I would not consider Madame Taussaud's a top sight, but that's me).  Their tea time recommendations really don't match overlap the other two books I have at all - but since tea is not in the index, I can't find it.<br /><br />I like the part at the start of the book that has a really quick \\"don't miss\\" part showing \\"London's Top 16\\" - however they're not *my* top 16 and I would have definitely put them in a different order. I cannot understand who would say the Tate Modern or National Gallery is more interesting than the Tower of London -- but to each their own.  I'm sure their sample itineraries in the front will be very useful for some.<br /><br />All in all, I'd say this guide book is thoroughly average.  It appears to have very similar information to Rick Steves' and DK, in a different format, with some things better and some things that are not done as well.  It probably comes down to looking at each guidebook and deciding which format works best for you (or just buying all three and being a total overplanner, like me).
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I am having a lot of fun with this app. My brother and parents love it too! We all will take turns playing a game and then decide which one to unlock next. Addicting and an enjoyment for the whole family!
B006Y9BVRM|5.0|This is an awesome watch at a great price.  In my opinion the quality is that of a much more expensive watch.  It's water resistant to 200m making it a true dive watch.  I like that it's solar powered so the only time I need to open the solid case is to have it service years down the road.  Great lum, too.
B005K17RU0|5.0|love this app. easy to move between several favorite locations. very visual app with easy to read weather advise. works great on my kindle fire!
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I cannot understand the people who did not like this movie.  It was visually stunning, there was a great plot, the characters were interesting and it had all of the action, romance, humor, excitement, good and bad guys that a person could want.  I absolutely loved this movie and I will be extremely disappointed if they do not make a sequel.  I never listen to what critics say about movies and I am so glad because the movies that I do find I hate are always movies that these idiot critics say are so important and deep etc.  I want a movie that entertains me, not one that makes me depressed by the time I have finished watching it.  This was a fun movie that kept me entertained throughout.  I got emotionally involved with the characters also.  I love good movies and this was one.  The people who did not like this either were half asleep before they got to the movie or they thought they were going to see some other movie.  Anyway, if you love a good entertaining feel good movie that makes you happy when you exit the theatre, go see this one.
B003O86FMW|4.0|The book was really good. It was well thought out and it has a lot of action in it... I think the writing is not as good as Harry Potter or the Hobbit but if you like romance and action and thinking and rebellion, then you will love this book very much. I have told my friends about this book and they agree with me that this is a good book to have!
B004KBSQOW|5.0|I've always loved Iz's version of \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\\".  I think the version on this CD is shorter than others I have heard.  The other songs are great.  Listing to this CD reminds me of everything I love about Hawai'i'.

It tell us what is going to end, what Katniss went through, if she even kills Snow and who she marries and stays with the rest of her life. Katniss makes some big decisions in this book. This book is one of the best books in the Hunger Games serious. To have some peace, you have to read this book to understand everything at the end. This book is famous for the ending of the war!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|There are certain places that at the end of the page...the next page does not pick up where the previous one left off.  Very frusterating.

1609611543|5.0|Excellent!!  Myself and a family member have hidden gluten sensitivities (No stomach aches, and no celiac).  But integrative doctor's labs show gluten intolerance which is responsible for MANY seemingly unrelated health problems including brain/mind.  We are dumping the frequent use of all processed grains including the gluten free processed foods which turn to sugar causing body fat and disease.  Thanks to the post that suggested pancakes etc. made with almond flour (good topped with whole berries and a tiny bit of agave for syrup). Get organic agave, there's a lot of fraud/fake agave and honey.

B00000I8UF|5.0|This is a pure hard-bop classic. I once read that you can hear Art Blakely drum after he stops. It is true, and evident on this album. I can only relate it to something like \\"aftertaste\\" except that your ears taste it! Highly recommended recording, should be on the short list of must have Jazz albums.

0786939532|5.0|I am 13 and I hardly ever read, that is, until my Dad handed me Homeland: The Dark Elf Trilogy, Part 1 (Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt, Book 1). At first I judged it by the cover and I said to my Dad, \\"It looks cool and I'll try to read it\\". When I started the book I was already in the middle of reading another book for school. It was too confusing to read both so I concentrated on finishing my book for school. When I finished that book, I started Homeland again. After reading about half of the book, my Dad gave me a Kindle Fire. I decided to buy Homeland for my kindle. I could not put it down.  It was so good. I finished the book in three days. Now I am reading the second book of the best series ever; still as good as the first book Homeland. I hope you read the book because it is an intense, action packed, sad at times, book! I loved the book and you will too!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|And so the journey continues.......<br /><br />Book one ends with Anastasia leaving Christian and Darker picks up with her regretting every moment of being apart from him. What starts out as a prior promise from Christian to attend her friend's art show with her ends up with some powerful revelations about Mr. Grey and the feelings Ana truly has for him.<br /><br />Ms. James' writing is very powerful. In Darker, she answers all the questions that are raised in Fifty Shades of Grey. Why is Christian a Dominant? Why does he have such self-loathing? Why can't Anastasia touch him? She brings in one of Christian former Subs which ends in a very compelling and heart-wrenching moment for Anastasia and expands more on his relationship with \\"Mrs. Robinson\\". That should give you a hint of some of Christian's problems and where some of them stem from. There are several poignant scenes in Darker that bring Anastasia and Christian closer together and finally allows him to accept love.<br /><br />There are lighter parts to the book as well. The e-mails continue and get more and more explicit. They are just \\"cute\\". Something a normal couple would do as they are starting to learn about each other. (Make sure you read the RE: in all the e-mails - they are hysterical) All the back-ground players come back into the picture with a twist at the end. Mrs. Robinson is finally put in her place and Christian finally gives Anastasia the \\"Hearts and Flowers\\" that she has been searching for.<br /><br />There is plenty of sex throughout the book....Including an interesting and very erotic scene where Ana does explore Christian's dominant side and finds out how exhilarating it can be for her.<br /><br />I've also learned a new vocabulary with Darker. \\"Kinky F***ery\\" and, my favorite, \\"f***edupness\\". Mr. Grey is still Fifty Shades throughout the book and, just as in Fifty Shades of Grey, the title and the book-cover go hand and hand with this book.<br /><br />Now, I do need to address one more upsetting subject that I heard about. \\"Mommy Porn\\". How ridiculous! Neither of these books are Pornography. They are tastefully done. They are erotic. They are a beautiful love story. They explain a life-style but, more importantly, they show how love, faith, trust and commitment bring two people together and how one person can finally heal another. If you are reading these books just for the sex or the BDSM, you are reading them for the wrong reasons.<br /><br />Now that I have vented on that, I am moving on to Fifty Shades Freed.......Laters, baby!setting subject that I heard about. \\"Mommy Porn\\". How ridiculous! Neither of these books are Pornography. They are tastefully done. They are erotic. They are a beautiful love story. They explain a life-style but, more importantly, they show how love, faith, trust and commitment bring two people together and how one person can finally heal another. If you are reading these books just for the sex or the BDSM, you are reading them for the wrong reasons.<br /><br />Now that I have vented on that, I am moving on to Fifty Shades Freed.......Laters, baby!
B005H1SDQU|4.0|I really enjoy most of this recording. I think that most people who are considering this album (i.e., reading this) will probably enjoy it. You probably came to this recording by way of other progressive rock music. Hackett does a good job here, with many well conceived songs and competent guitar playing. Although this recording will be completely forgotten by 2050, I can certainly recommend that you enjoy it in the meantime. Pretty damn good performance, just not incredibly memorable.
B004EPZ07U|3.0|I thought the movie was good. It could have been a bit longer for me. My problem is with the Ultraviolet Digital Copy. I have all my digital copies in iTunes. Ultraviolet requires another player, two more website accounts and a bunch of hassle. I will ALWAYS choose a digital copy that I can download in the format I CHOOSE over Ultraviolet!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I absolutly loved all 3 books. I would love to read more books just like these from E.L. James. If she could continue on with the children and how they will grow up. Maybe one good child and one bad.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|Denzel Washington at his finest!This movie was AWESOME! A fine depiction of faith and virtue. This movie is very under appreciated, I didn't hear enough about it.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|Of course this is a great recording from the Beatles. I assume that most of you are aware of that. So, what about this edition? I like the sound quality of this remastered edition very much. I found that it was a vast improvement over the original and recommend it based on that alone.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|kind of liked it until force close its not worth money...good thing I didn't buy it just a tip don't get it
B002ZG97M4|5.0|They remade Footloose?  I groaned when I even thought about how bad this was going to be.  I liked the original, and didn't even consider seeing this when it came out at the theatre.  Flash forward to a cold and rainy night, and my teenage kids decide to rent this on pay per view.  I groan again, thinking how awful this is going to be.  I couldn't even watch it, so I puttered around the house doing everything else but sit there and watch a somewhat iconic movie be destroyed.  Two hours later, and my kids could not stop talking about it.  They loved it.  Curious, I plopped down and watched it.  They wanted to see it again.  I was shocked.  The first thing that grabs your attention is how my kids kept thinking the clothes and hair were cool.  I told them that in the ancient 80's, we used to flip our collars up, have our pants cinched at the ankles, and wear our hair short on the sides and long on top.  I also told them we used to dance.  It was a blast from the past, but a bridge to the present.  The story seemed fresh to the teenagers, and was even fresh to me.  The dancing is great.  The acting is decent, and this movie is fun.  There are a few scenes that are not appropriate for younger kids (a girl having sex for the first time, drug references, underage drinking, a girl getting slapped by her boyfriend, some swearing), but very tame stuff when compared to the groundbreaking stuff John Hughes did in the 80's.  It was a way to connect with the kids.  The movie is certainly way better than expected.  Way better than the garbage some remakes are.  Well done.  Well done indeed.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I have enjoyed this series SO MUCH - SEVERAL TIMES ALREADY. So romantic, so rich in subtle expressions of feelings and emotions and misreading of messages and finally the usual Jane Austen ending of awakening to the truth and love conquering all. For anyone with a romantic nature, this cannot be beat.
B00003CXDD|5.0|I saw this so many times with my kids when it forst came out. I bought it again to watch myself now that my kids are adults. It is still a wonderful movie. Very enjoyable and a decent story without getting too stupid.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|this game is fun but there is many things to fix... one of the things is why do u need wifi to play it? it is so much harder to check my food there is plqenty of other things to fix but I don't have enough time to list them it is still fun
0955153077|5.0|This book is GREAT,it starts with the beginner in mind with strait foreward screen shots and easy to follow tutorials. It also comes in a really cool book sheath for storage and protection.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|Despite having to read it in subtitles, despite my not knowing anything about Japanese death customs, despite it being a Japanese movie, (meaning I was not it's target audience), I loved this movie.
B000005H7D|5.0|What a musician; it really shows on this recording. It is certainly my favorite recording from this period of his career. Perhaps he is a bit more grounded than on later albums. You can read that two ways; he was not as high on heroin and / or he had not gone as deeply into modal Jazz at this point. Doen't matter which one wou choose, as both are pretty much true.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I thought this movie did a great job, capturing the spirit of the books, while being a fresh take on that material.  Too bad it didn't do better in the theaters, because I would have liked to see some sequels.  I ended up really liking the framing scenes that took place on Earth.  One of my favorite characters, though, was Woola, the faithful 'dog.'  It certainly wasn't anything too deep, but neither was the source material, just lots of good fun.  I will be buying the Blueray disc as soon as it is available.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was very skeptical when I first saw these books.  Since they took The Hunger Games out of the top 3 in the Amazon list I was interested.  After reading the synopsis I didn't think that I would like it.  I've been reading romance novels for as long as I can remember.  I find the story line of them to be very similar.  Rough/tough man meets meek/mild girl.  They fall in love.  Rough/tough man doesn't think he is worthy of girl and/or he hurts girl.  Girl leaves and then man realizes that he can't live without girl.  They live happily ever after.  These books blew all the expectations out of the water.  Just when I thought it was going to go in the typical way it would turn a complete different direction.  There are times when I wanted to kill both characters, times I hated them, and times that I loved them.  Christian has got to be my favorite character in a long time.  I am going back and reading them again, which is how much I loved them.  I sure hope we here more from this author and these characters.  Bravo!!!!
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|Love the original, and this game adds new challenges to the mix. Instead of strategy and form, this game seems to be more about proper timing. It's challenging, but can be frustrating if a fraction of a second timing error in the game causes you to miss a candy. This happens most in the suction cup levels.<br /><br />The biggest gripe I have are the ads. I paid for this app, and expect an ad free experience. I don't want a pop-up asking me to download the original CTR nor  social networking site offers. Luckily, I can block this with my ROM, but still annoying to see on a paid app.
0439023521|5.0|Read it in 2 days!  Can't wait to read book 2 and 3!  Bought it for my middle school daughter but it sucked me in!  Can't wait to see the movie, I hope it doesn't disappoint too much.
B0058SN2C2|5.0|These Crocs are not only cute and comfy but so stylish.  Oh, yeah, stylish.  I said it!  I have them in the Black and Espresso colors.  The little scalloped opening make the top very feminine.  The comfort of Crocs with a more sleek look.  These go great with capris and skirts.  So glad I found them on Amazon.com!
B004EPYZPS|5.0|Sometimes you just can't beat an amazon deal. ten bucks for the movie (after four dollars off the price). Also came with a free VOD rental. The movie was excellent and I recommend you at least try it.
B0000027F8|5.0|The songs are great.  There is a little bit of something for everyone-a little bit of dance, rock, reggae, jazz, love songs.  It is still a great album many moons later.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|The first book was the best by far.  The second one was compelling.  I had a little trouble getting into this one, but overall I can't fault the author or the series.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|when I first downloaded this game it played fine. when I went back to play later I got the same as everyone else force close over and over. if it helps anyone to know I downloaded it on my kindle fire I am going to uninstall and reinstall and see if that helps.
B005K17RU0|5.0|it works great. has plenty of information.  very useful. use it everyday, especially now when the weather is so unpredictable.
B006SMLAMQ|2.0|Nice app but Clock wont tell time on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus  GT-P6210. Not really a widget but an app. When its fix... i'll install it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|The game is very Cool.  I love this game.  It's the best I've played on my Kindle Fire so far.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I loved it! its a pretty awesome game I play it all the time. there's only two or three games on it I cant beat.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|if u press force close u cant play it any more. but before it was great but now not.Ps hdjdjdnsnnsndndbx
B0024SQW2Q|4.0|This is my favorite installment of the underworld series. I just wish it had some color to it. About 30 minutes in I just thought \\"wow...this is only white and blue\\". I understand it is a stylistic choice but I would have liked to have seen a bit more color.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|this is a good app,but it does not tell you if you did not or did make that element. already I cant remember all of the combinations,so I do strugel with it other wise its a good game,oh but also this force close comes up ever like 30 seconds so I count really play and had to delete it oh well
1469984202|5.0|I loved this book and the subsequent books 2, 3, 4, 5.  I just got more and more interested with each book I read.  The characters are so interesting and multidimensional.  And frankly the situation is very believable as was the fully fortified bomb shelter.  But this environment is so extensive and well thought out that I was fascinated.  Couldn't put them down and want Wool6 to be written.
B0055SWM08|5.0|love the beauty and elegance of this simple yet intriguing game.  you should try it, but make sure you have a couple hours...
B006SMLAMQ|2.0|Beautiful app. I especially loved the  fact that I could have a clock/weather widget that would look like HTC's sense clock widget on my Droid Bionic - or so I thought. It doesn't have a widget for my phone. 46MB download and they can't include a widget?! The sad part is that they included widgets for my Motorola Xoom running Honeycomb, but not my Bionic running Gingerbread.<br /><br />I'm glad I got this as the free app of the day on Amazon and not actually pay for this - I would have been upset. I'm going back to Beautiful Weather. It looks almost as good and best of all it has widgets!
0385344228|2.0|I just finished Defending Jacob and I don't know what all the hoopla is about this book, I read many books and this one is not one that will stick in my mind<br />I give it two stars
B004T2QZL8|1.0|very cool game, but crashes when wrong elements combined!  please fix so we can all enjoy! force close is so very frustrating!
B004SYP5WC|5.0|This particular app is very useful.  It is easy to use and accomplishes just what I need.  Straight forward...what you see is what you get.
B0063IH60K|4.0|great fun. very easy to use. I love the touch screen to move each card automaticly. great way to pass the time
B004TTZHBK|1.0|I was excited to test out this app, but it was doomed out of the gate. Upon opening the app for the first time it stated 80mb of additional content needed to be downloaded. The problem is this fails immediately and there is no way to try and download again without force closing.<br /><br />So basically I have a half baked app in which I can not actually get the additional content, images and videos. There is also the issue about the app not rotating from portrait to landscape - even when it is actually telling you to rotate to landscape.  Oh, and the app loves to FC on its own. I would request a refund but Amazon makes it such a pain to get a refund it is not even worth it. Lesson learned.
B005PDJBRU|5.0|and he's less than a year old - the combo of Craig ( not-Mom) + baby Alfie (Stormaggedeon) is adorable. On the surface, this episode may seem like a filler since River, Amy & Rory only have short cameos, but it set ups the final episode beautifully - giving the Doctor time to come to emotional acceptance with the fact that his death is facing him now.<br /><br />It's funny how even with the updated technology - the CG on the silver-zippy thing, that the enemies are so old school and industrial looking. Oh, aliens, haven't you seen the Apple-aesthetic revolution in electronic designs? ----(ooh wait, the episode before this featured some of the more sleek robots. nevermind then, ha!)
B004T2QZL8|5.0|(I'm at 84 now, and so far everything works well on the Galaxy Note - so chances are the new version fixed those problems.)<br /><br />I went into this game with mixed feelings, being quite drawn to the simple yet nice graphics but not sure whether the developers would manage to keep a good balance between too easy and too frustrating (with these kinds of games it's especially easy to get too far-fetched). I'm happy to say that it's neither one, at least for me the balancing works really well. The combinations make sense but are not too obvious, either. The hint function really helps with avoiding any frustration that might stem from running out of ideas.<br /><br />Hope the new version works just as well for others and the game will be redeemed from the bad ratings.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|The title says it all. This app was great for the free app of the day on Kindle Fire, but after 42 matches it force closes if you don't make an element. Very frustrating. I am a fan of the simple Alchemy game and this would be a great improvement - if it worked.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|they fixed the force closing issue!  about ten minutes after I started playing it kept closing, and then magically an update appeared. the issue is fixed an I'm having fun creating new elements in this game...great faotd
B004T2QZL8|1.0|I love this game. I just cant play for long without it producing a force close. it gets old. very fast. can you fix it?
B003Y5H5HY|1.0|This rating is not about the movie, but about the digital copy technology. I have three other Ultra Vision titles (HP, Hangover 2 and Edgar) and the Ultravision digital copy is terrible. I travel (plane travel to EU and Asia) alot and having these digital copies is useless as you cannot watch on the plane. Not to mention if you are in a hotel, you would have to use the internet service there (most hotels you need to pay for this), or use the 3 or 4g service of your ipad and chew up your data plan. I have also tried to correspond with Flixster and their customer service is awful, I submitted a \\"ticket\\" to them back around Jan. 18 and (on March 19) the issue is still not resolved.<br /><br />Very poor planning and even worse execution. I can't believe there are still movies being released with this technology.
B000KIPT30|2.0|I got this to help with a simple home recording studio setup, however there was a noticeable drop in audio quality when using it. High frequency sounds were muffled and the bass was slightly boosted, basically making everything sound muddy.<br /><br />If you don't care about differences in audio quality, the device itself seems well built and otherwise works as designed.
B005EGXTEE|4.0|If you liked the previous books-you'll like this one as well. Charlie finds more trouble than she can handle but still solves the case with some events not being probable. Even so its an enjoyable who done it. Giving the reader an interesting quick light read.
B005MGAM82|2.0|The product description is completely incorrect and so is the item picture that they have posted. It says that (in the product description not the product title) this is the 5 volume set with \\"A Storm of Swords\\" being divided into 2 but what you actually get is the 4 volume, mass print edition (with the HBO TV series covers). This is a blatant misdirection on the part of the sellers. While the books and the box set is in pristine condition (thankfully) the fact that the product is not as described is very disappointing. Also, this set is overpriced considering that you are paying for the 5 vol. edition but getting the 4 vol. one. There are much better deals for that here in amazon. Please do not buy this set, you will not get what you paid for.
B0017SWPXY|3.0|It's a well written story but thought it would be more about dogs and it turned out to be more about auto racing.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|love evernote. great, simple, cross-platform tool. use on Pc, Mac, kindle fire and android phone.  simple to share notebooks with others and collaborate.
B00018D44U|5.0|She is right up there with Diana Krall they are different but beautiful. (I'm a 70yr old retired cop)  If you are a little up tight, sit back and absorb her soothing voice.[[ASIN:B00005YW4H Come Away With Me] and/or[ASIN:B00018D44U Feels Like Home]]
B0058VW36U|5.0|i love this game! The little monster thing is cute i really love this game works like a charm best game ever
B0073LWEXK|4.0|this game is a relative steal for the dollar price.  the game play is simmilar to grisly mannor but the graphics are MUCH better.  it was nice to have the hints/spoilers in the game when I was stuck, but my only complaint was that finding my way through all the boards got a bit confusing once I had all of them because many were very similar.  ran beautifully on my kindle fire. would recommend to anyone looking for lots of puzzles
B004T2QZL8|3.0|this app is really really fun, but it force closed after you try to combine the elements after a while. Id wait until they fix it to get it.
B00005JM02|4.0|Great movie; a little longer than it needs to be but our little boy loves it. It's also great for teaching your child about different sea creatures.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|Yea I'm getting the force close bug also. I have to say it was fun, until the force close bug.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Easy to play. Not too many ads. Great way to kill time during television commercials. I Paley it every day.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|the game is kinds confusing it doesn't give very much direction in the first place you have to find it and it also doesn't tell you no instruction really its kinda irritating
B0054JZC6E|3.0|It has a lot of fun games to play, and keeps you busy. I think its best suited for kids.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like the variety of games to explore. would like to see more explainations before some the games. some of them were confusing at first.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love this game, it is so much fun. It was totally worth the 99 cents.  Some of the goals are difficult to accomplish, but I still love playing it!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Really enjoy this game, good puzzles and serene settings and music. One of the best puzzle games out there right now.
0307719219|5.0|There is a current in modern political economy that says countries succeed because of their natural resources and their control over others. Countries fail because they lack natural resources and are controlled by others. This current is best characterized by Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs and Steel and Collapse.<br /><br />WHY NATIONS FAIL is in large part a contra to this current, and reintroduces the theme that institutions matter more than the natural resources and land, and so it should be institutions that are most important when we look at why countries succeed or fail (and how to improve the latter). The primary reason the authors claim that the old current is wrong is that it can be seen in the past--there have been many countries with plenty of resources that have failed. Likewise, there have been plenty of countries with minimal resources that have succeeded. The answer must come elsewhere.<br /><br />Obviously, it helps to have natural resources, but it is much more important what the people do with those resources. The authors of this book show that countries with \\"inclusive\\" political institutions--institutions which are pluralistic and democratic in nature--are capable of providing incentives for the people to be industrious and thus prosperous. Meanwhile, countries with \\"exclusive\\" political institutions--institutions which are extractive and exploitative in nature--are incapable of providing such incentives and thus fail to become industrious and prosperous.<br /><br />The thesis is very reminiscent of another book on this topic, [[ASIN:1600200494 Juggernaut: Why the System Crushes the Only People Who Can Save It]], which also has as its central thesis this very notion. I would recommend it if you want to get a more concrete explanation of how exactly the mechanics of open economies work--from independence to private property to industry and free trade.<br /><br />If there was a single gripe I would have with WHY NATIONS FAIL, it is that the authors don't spend enough time investigating how we, the United States, and other western nations, are actually taking on some of the characteristics that make other nations fail, why we are doing this, and how to correct it. They are content to focus on the failures of other countries--which makes complete sense. But it is necessary to keep this in mind as we, ourselves, are proving this theory correct--and not in a good way.<br /><br />Ultimately, the book is crucial in this political climate, and key to anyone's understanding of how a successful country comes about.
B000QFW7UA|5.0|There's really not much to say. The film looks beautiful in Blu-ray. The anniversary package is incredible, all the goodies inside are gorgeous and comprehensive. I wish they'd have included the Brazilian dubbing, but that's just a personal gripe that in no way affect the quality of this awesome edition.
B001PSVQMC|5.0|\\"...Wow. Could anyone have predicted that the best power metal album (so far) of 2009 would be from a cover band? Granted, Clairvoyants is an Iron Maiden cover band, and you know that if they can pull of Maiden songs for the better part of a decade they have to be pretty good at what they do. Still, technical proficiency doesn't always translate into songwriting ability (see: Malmsteen, Yngwie), which is why an album like Word to the Wise is such a pleasant surprise.\\" (Hardrockhaven.net - 8,5/10)<br /><br />\\"...The band plays a style similar to Iron Maiden during the first Dickinson era, yet with a bit of a more modern approach and some power metal (bits of both the heavier US and the more melodic European style) riffs added to the fold, comparing these guys to Angra wouldn't be that far-fetched either. Although the songwriting as well as the whole instrumental section, guitar solos included, is heavily influenced by the heavy metal legends, Clairvoyants never really copy and the CD definitely has a more personal feeling than I would have expected.\\" (Metalstorm.ee - 8/10)
B004T2QZL8|1.0|was working fine for a while.  now force closes.  evo 3d.  same game as alchemy.  was fun when it was working.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|This app was great...when it was working...WAY too many issues though. Constantly freezing up and doing a force close. Good thing it was free...would be seriously annoyed if I had purchased this with all its issues!!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Evernote is one of the apps that I run on everything - phone, Kindle Fire, work laptop, &amp; home desktop. Overall Evernote is a solid &quot;5&quot; but I rated the Fire app as a 4 because I think the UI for sorting &amp; filtering large numbers of notes could stand some improvement.
B006SMLAMQ|2.0|I had Fancy Widgets on my phone but saw this as the free FAOTD and figured it was worth trying. I figured there had to be a widget somewhere, nope there wasn't. This app is slow and pointless. Back to Fancy Widgets I go!
B004T2QZL8|1.0|It makes me sad that an app is created (it did not evolve) that makes us want to be a god. Why can't we seek the true god, who is God.. Yet, thanks for the free app.
