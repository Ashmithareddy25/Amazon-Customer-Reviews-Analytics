B00B2V66VS|4.0|If you're stuck in an airport, long meeting, then this is an app that's fun to play while waiting.  I'm not a  big game player so, it could possibly get a 5 star from someone who enjoys playing games frequently.  My 8 year old (of course) nephew enjoys it but it will get hung up (stop running) at times.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Way better than the movie such a good book and I can't wait to finish the series. I highly recommend.
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|This season devolved into maudlin and predictable tragedy, particularly regarding Matthew and Mary. Fellowes and Co. can do better.  Season end was awful.
B00DQQZNZW|5.0|In recent years I've found myself anticipating PSB's &#34;single&#34; releases more than their albums, because the remixes and B-sides were usually more interesting - edgier, creative, more uninhibited - than the album tracks. With Electric, I feel that they've allowed themselves to push the boundaries in several ways: not worry about thematic consistency, not care about whether they're repeating themselves, go for the edge rather than the center. It helps that they've come up with one of the half dozen best PSB songs ever - &#34;Love Is A Bourgeois Construct&#34; - to anchor the collection, but all of the tracks are INTERESTING, exciting, compelling. Wonderful stuff.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|It take a little to get used to it but its good...will recommend ! Looking forward to the next season.
0394826817|4.0|Overall good book, useful for teaching good manners to children. It is geared just right for the kindergarten age group. My children found it very funny & entertaining. I feel the book could have been organized a bit better. I wish there weren't so many blatant examples of bad behavior in the book. Also, the example of giving someone who gives you a present a \\"BIG kiss\\", otherwise according to the book you are stingy.....well, for several different reasons this is just a bad idea and certainly should not be taught to children in 2013.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I use this little tool on many of my knifes, and it keeps all of them extremely sharp and efficient.
0385349947|4.0|When I started this book, I didn't expect much. I hadn't paid a lot of attention to the buzz around it, but had a general negative impression. I decided to read it anyway mostly because my 21-year-old daughter is politically active around women's issues and I feel it is important to honor her priorities by keeping up on what's current.<br /><br />After reading the book, I can say that the buzz is overly critical. Ms. Sandberg does a good job of laying out the issues and discussing them honestly. She doesn't pretend to represent all women, in fact she explicitly says that expectations of women in power to do so misses the point of equality. We wouldn't expect a successful man to represent all men.<br /><br />This is a thought-provoking book. I encourage everyone to read it as part of the conversation of gender issues of our day. And I really, really hope (though don't expect) it is totally obsolete in 20 years.
B000FA57RG|5.0|Love the message of the movie, even though it gets kabbalah preachy at the end... I wish the entire Re-Invention tour was released on DVD and not just snippets of the show.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Really liked it.  Better than I thought it would be going in. Hope TC makes another one.  Good solid fun.  Not great, but good.
B008DBF5Z8|5.0|Great quality images and easy to use software that beats out Elmo cameras and their expensive prices.  Must buy for teachers!
B00CDT41RY|4.0|This one left me wanting more for some reason.  Not bad.  Actually very good.  But Quentin's previous movie, INGLORIOUS BASTERDS was much better.  This get's 4 stars.  IB would get 4 3/4 stars.
B000H5U832|1.0|Movie didnt even work waste of my money very upset when I gave it to my nephew and it did not play.
B004EF65QA|5.0|What a superb series.  Much too short but I don't know if I could have taken more suspense anyway!  If this was a book, I would have read the last chapter to see what happened.  Fascinating look into the cotton mills in northern England before cotton was popular.  BBC has the best mini series.
B000I9UA8U|4.0|I have wanted to see this movie for a long time but never got around to renting it. Glad I did. It was funny, as expected, but surprisingly sweet and touching in others. I expected something different but got something better. Would definitely watch it again.
B0012HF5NC|5.0|Great movie! Of course you should not try to over-analyze things. That would take away from the fun. This DVD includes the extended version and the theatrical release version of the movie. The extended version really wasn't anything special. I can see why it wasn't included in the original release. At only $4.99, the DVD was a great deal.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|I recommend this to all business professionals.  He was indeed a genius and a leader.  If you can incorporate humanism
B00CO8AF60|4.0|I choose my words very carefully, so please don't think I'm overselling it when I say, this is a masterpiece. OK, maybe I'm overselling it a little.<br /><br />Say what you will about Stone and Parker and their brand of comedy (I happen to enjoy it). But do yourself a favor and check out this movie, just for the fact that it's brilliant puppeteering. It's very precise and almost too lifelike- to the point that they intentionally throw in awkward fight scenes and such, to remind you of the fact that you're watching puppets and not real actors.<br /><br />I've been waiting for this to come out on Bluray for WAAY too long. So glad that it finally has! The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is because apparently there are no extras (the DVD extras are fantastic, I love all the \\"making of\\" stuff - it makes you appreciate what a complicated endeavor this was).<br /><br />Get it. Watch it. You'll be glad you did.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Maggie Smith could not be more fantastic, and the other actors shine as well. Season three does not disappoint, though it tugs at the heart strings.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's not impossibly hard but at the same time challenging. You have to use all the clues to open the doors. Sometimes you have to check all of them first then you start opening the clues. They feed of each others.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|A friend recommended this series and we have become hooked.  The writing is just so superb, and we just laugh out loud.  We actually just finished Season Three and are waiting for the DVD for Season Four to be released so we can begin again.
B008469DGY|4.0|game is a fun time consumer guys you know when she drags you shopping Saturday so you can have the Tv Sunday hassle free for the football games!
B009AP2G26|5.0|As all of them are it was awesome! I think every season is great. The talent of the singers is amazing!!!!
B009VIZDLI|4.0|What a wonderfully funny yet poignant read. I loved the quirky characters with their different takes on love and life.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|Omg this has to be the most fun relaxing game I have played in a long time. I have plausible 300 games so far very addicting. Highly recommend for all ages.
B007RFDCQA|5.0|I still love this movie and I'm 22yrs old. My older siblings introduced me to this movie when I was 8/9 yrs old n it's still awesome!
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|This is a fun, fast paced little game.  Good for when you need a quick break from a project or to occupy yourself while waiting for an appointment.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Outstanding!  Eloquently written!  Engaging!  What a wonderful story and a wonderful writer.  I am recommending this to my Book Club.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|My kindle was givng messgae that internal storage was exceeded. My library showed nothing on the device. Clean Master found the movies I thought had been deleted. Kindle working fine now!
B0059XTV4Y|5.0|Movie is amazing. From the concept to the plot. The exposé to the cinematography, it was very well thought out
B004XUMMFE|5.0|To only do one season of this show was a crime. This premise was terrific, exciting - the space-western theme was fun and still believable even though at first one might dismiss the idea, it worked on so many levels.<br />The cast was spot on perfect. I so wish the show was still on because I love Nathan Fillian in the role  captain even more than I love him as Castle. Really, he is brilliant in the role.<br />Why, ooh why did they not continue this series?
B009NY43NY|4.0|I can see why people were upset about the  book, they expected a huge ending.  If anyone paid attention to the books up to this point, they should have not been surprised at the ending.  Sookie did not want to be a Vampire, she wanted a family and who better to fall in love with but Sam someone who has cared about her from the beginning.  I did not give the book a 5 star rating because I thought the ending came up very fast, other than that I really liked the book.
B008I43DYU|4.0|Easy access. Nice large size. Always in my bag handy to use. A great easy calculator to follow. First class
B004HO6I4W|5.0|Great bargain and shipping was fast. The grand kids love the movies and so do I. The colors in this movie are so lively and colorful.
B0087FMUCQ|4.0|This is a fun and entertaining game to check out.  I think it is about the best golf game I have found.  The different mini games and levels are fun to play thru.  Overall this game is worth playing.
B004UFEJS0|5.0|My grandkids and I love this movie. They want to watch it every time they come over and I so enjoy it with them.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I from Israel a this google chrome is blocked in my country. I can not use it And that's unfortunate
B005CS3VQ0|5.0|Anyone interested in languages and the translation process will love this book.  It is written gracefully and with engaging wit.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I enjoyed this book tremendously. The characters, the story, the setting were all engaging. I read each night until I couldn't. I am just glad the rest of the trilogy is available now and I don't have to wait to keep going.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book is a must read on everyone's list, it'll show you the true human spirit and determination on a level completely unheard of
B00AHGSVKS|3.0|I like most of Clarke's work. This one is a little darker than most of his work in my opinion but it's a interesting take on what would happen if aliens actually came to earth.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|One of the finest, character driven stories I have read in a long time. If Martin had focused on a single character, it may have looked like this.
B002P73UQW|5.0|The show keeps going strong without losing any of it's momentum. The characters continue to be unique and funny and the interactions between them are gold.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|I purchased this dvd used, the condition was excellent, as well as the price & service. I've purchased Michael Moore documentaries before, and have been pleased.  There is no reason why government and business cannot work together to make life easier for people to live a comfortable life. Buy this one, watch it, and pass it on.
B005S39YGU|5.0|I love this show. The characters are all quirky but not too over the top. Once I start watching I have a hard time stopping. The episodes are very rewatchable and make me laugh over and over.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|I would have given a 4 star but had already read the book. The movie did capture the grittiness of the books and  Duvall was a great surprise.  The movie is worth watching but don't expect to see a 6' 5&#34; Reacher.
B004NELBPC|4.0|Too many advertisements.  Also too many articles 'tease' you before letting you have the main crux of the article or information; too many 'clicks' required to get to the theme of an article.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I found this novel gripping- so much so that I raced through it and now will go back to really read it.  Definitely delivers a good story.
B00EV4EUT8|4.0|I saw this movie on the day it opened in Atlanta, August 16, and have been unable to get it out of my head since then. It has an awful lot going for it. Although it is based loosely on the life of Eugene Allen, a butler for the White House from the presidency of Harry Truman to that of Ronald Reagan (from an article by Wil  Haygood of the \\"Washington Post\\"), Director Lee Daniels (\\"Precious\\") takes many liberties with the facts of Mr. Allen's life, something I have not a problem with as everything in every frame in this not-to-be-missed film actually took place in this country, whether it was the rape of a sharecropper's wife by a white man who then killed the sharecropper (I have a good friend who tells a similar story about his own grandfather in the rural South in the middle years of the 20th century) or the conflict between Cecil Gaines (Forest Whitaker) and his son Louis (David Oyelowo), who is a fictionalized character, or his other son who dies in Vietnam, which also did not happen to Mr. Allen's son.<br /><br />The acting of the three main characters Whitaker, Oyelowo and Oprah Winfrey as Gloria, Cecil Gaines' wife, is in a word superb (I had forgotten what a talented actress Ms. Winfrey is, not having seen her in a film since \\"The Color Purple\\" several years ago). Of course Allen/Gaines was a witness to the history of the civil rights movement in this country. (Gaines actually goes to the inauguration of  Mr. Obama, an event that actually happened  I believe as did the Allens being invited by Nancy Reagan to attend a state dinner.) Gaines' buddies, the other butlers in the White House, provide much comic relief in this very serious movie that probably won't be seen by those individuals who need to be reminded most about  how many white people treated  black people in much of the 20th century.<br /><br />My only complaint about the movie is that few of the actors who played the many presidents the butler worked for were very convincing to me. On the other hand, I found Jane Fonda as Nancy Reagan as she gushes about  her beloved \\"Ronnie\\" totally believable although she had the smallest of roles.<br /><br />I suspect the film is destined to become a classic. I would certainly see it again,  the highest praise I can give to any movie.d, I found Jane Fonda as Nancy Reagan as she gushes about  her beloved \\"Ronnie\\" totally believable although she had the smallest of roles.<br /><br />I suspect the film is destined to become a classic.

B005HSL626|5.0|this game is the most adicting game ever and if u love this game then u should get subway surf,angry Gran, tells run,and happy fall...they help hand eye cooridantion...lol
B004LPLU4K|5.0|The story is beautiful. The actors were very good for the most part at making me believe their characters; a couple of times I thought they were a bit overly dramatic. Overall, it was very well done. The scenery is wonderful; the animals beautiful. This is a great family movie with some drama, suspense and childhood innocence.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game once u start playing u cant put it down.<br />It works great on my kindle fire. Lots of fun really keeps u on ur toes.<br />:p
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Quartet provides a wonderful story about relationships, about aging, and about exceptional people interacting again. It may appeal to an older audience who has watched a parent decline while still having moments of younger brilliance or who have watched friends age.
B004UXUX4Q|3.0|Good but not spectacular.  Acting is okay, the music and scenery great, but the film overall leaves you wondering what was all that fuss about when it was released.  A reviewer said the story falls flat and I have to agree with that.  Save yoyr money and watch it on TV when you have a chance.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|Not bad! Some gore. Humorous at times. Overall I would say worth the rental if you like this type adventure film.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|great app.  I've not experienced any problems with it but I have the regular kindle.  I can see time avqilable for each program I use and how much time totally left.
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|I grew up reading Judge Dredd, every week I would rush down to the store and pick up my copy of 2000AD.<br /><br />This movie is only slightly  based on the original stories.  Firstly the time is wrong, the mega cities were set in a more futuristic world, vastly more tech based with robots alien life forms and space travel common place.<br /><br />This movie 100% fails to capture the spirit or style of the comic all they have done is used a poor man's version of the Judges and made your basic small story cop movie.
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|This book makes it very clear that we teach people how to treat us.  Also don't let the words of others direct your life.  It opens the reader to self discovery about ones feelings and how to live a happier life.<br /><br />Would recommend as a must read.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Had never played a game like this. The first game was a little tricky but after that the games just seem to flow off my stylus. I like it a lot.<br /><br />effie
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Like this app since it is self explanatory.  Works great for the feeble minded or the advanced users.  The soft display makes it gentle on the light sleeper.
1451695195|5.0|This book was incredible - I couldn't stop reading it so I shared with my daughter who is in her Residency to be a Neurosurgeon and she really enjoyed it so Thank You.
0385335482|5.0|Shopaholic is one of those books that are hard to put down! Sophie does a fantastic job getting you in sync with the heroin - and so many of the scenarios she's in are relatable. It's witty, enjoyable, just dramatic enough, and entertaining!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE this game. I like how you can get mystery boxes and jetpacks etc. this is a great game and I definitely recommend it.
B006O5XYWG|5.0|I was captivated from the beginning! Amazing cinematography, fun watch, interesting plot. This movie really sucks you in to Franco's vision and purpose...you find yourself completely bonded to his mission and then, you realize you're really just rooting for the chimp. I hope this is the first of many more to come!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great App  and you sure can't beat the price free.  I  highly recommend this app if you are looking for a good basic calculatator app.
B004U8VWLE|2.0|I hate to say it, because I love Natalie Portman, but this movie was troubling to watch. I know it's supposed to be a dark film but the character development was left wanting and the rest of the plot seemed too forced. At the end of the movie I didn't feel like I learned anything or connected with the film - instead, I felt sort of dirty and gross. If the director helped me to understand what the heroin was dealing with a little more, I may have connected to it better. I don't know...I just won't be recommending this to anyone.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Great Quality Backpack for Photographers, Reasonably priced. I would definitely recommend this product to other prospective Backpack buyers who are looking for a backpack in the mid price range.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|This is a wonderful family movie. We watched it three times in the same weekend. Can't wait for number two.
B00DWZHTRW|2.0|What a mess.  This movie could have been great - it started out strong but seriously fizzled by the middle and it was just a big fat mess.  I can't fathom WHY there would be an extended version of this movie.  Why would they want to EXTEND this mess?  Very disappointed.  I saw it in the theater too.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Satisfying for all you trekkies out there. Well done and great cinematography. I would definitely recommend this very good DVD.
193700788X|5.0|I am sad the series is over. It has been a great journey with many twists and turns and I have loved every step. I wish the ending would have been a little more rounded, but I always wanted her to end up with Sam. Would recommend it to anyone who loves the series.
B0036EH3UC|5.0|Entire series !  What could be better? Well, a separate DVD for outtakes, interview, etc.. Don't clutter all the other discs
B005D9MUWY|1.0|It kept trying to substitute other words for the words I intended even when I spelled them right. Worse than Apples auto correct on the i-phone. I spent more time correcting it than I spent typing out my words the old fashioned way. I deleted it. Luckily for me it was the free app of the day.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|always a goos picture when he is in it. Even if the material is mediocre [this isn't] Denzel is the MAN !
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Why did I have to re order facebook? When I bought the Kindle in March I had ordered a hole bunch of games and movies. Why is it asking again to go through email, and my connections again?<br />  Sandra Hiemstra
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I've become addicted to this game. It's very entertaining. This game never seems to get boring and really makes you think.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is the best game ever its worth 7 bucks it's awesome..............lite sucks get the full it's much better Minecrafts Awesome
B004UID2LC|4.0|Ever want to have a Youtube video with you that you saw the other day online?  Well, now you can.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Daughter has a nextbook as does my son.. same model. .. he can get the download on his but since factory resetting hers she can't.. don't know what that's about but company for nextbook really needs to address this issue. . as far as Amazon apps love then
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Nice keyboard.  The only think I would change is to have a solid number line in addition to letters instead of having to shift to get the numbers.
0553296981|4.0|My son's school required this to read through the summer. Great educational tool about dignity, courage, and perseverance. It is also a true story, a good breakaway from the usual fiction article he'd been reading.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This Bingo game is quite a bit different from other free bingo games.  This one actually connects to Facebook.  You can send gifts to either friends, or friends playing too.  There is the standard bingo game, and another set of special games.  One room, you get five free rounds. Slots, game is a fun blitz.
B004ZQBP3Q|5.0|Get this CD! If you like easy music to dance to and rock out with this is IT! In the car, at home, parties.... wherever you need a pick me up or inspiration to get down with your funky self- THIS IS FOR YOU!
B00821OX98|5.0|I am really enjoying watching the series. sometimes there is a bit of a lag in the streaming but it is not that noticeable.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved this book just as much as the previous books!  The storyline is easy to follow and the characters are so fully developed that you totally feel for them and what they are dealing with in their lives. So, so excited at the ending pages....
B0089XH38M|5.0|I have used AVG on various machines over the past years and it has performed excellently for me. I t runs in the background, updates frequently enough and I have not had a virus on the machines I have used it on. Can't beat the &#34;free&#34; part!
B00BGV0Y26|5.0|I loved the whole CD. I usually only like a couple of the songs on a CD, but this one is different.  AWSOME!!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I have several versions of Kindle on m pc's and androids. It works great on all but with one glaring shortfall -- that is, it has no text to speech capability and other text to speech programs won't run with it. I have a kindle dx which has text to speech and it helps me considerable as I have macular degeneration with limited central vision. The text to speech on that machine (which is not as good as Ivono) helps me comprehend and read.Text to speech would certainly help on my smartphone and tablets.
B009AY04A8|3.0|I am sorry to say that I am rather disappointed. This game has some great things going for it. The graphics are nice, the story is interesting, and there is a nice little variation in how you search for objects. Unfortunately, a lot of the objects are too easy to find, which makes the whole game a bit too easy. Also, the story ends as a cliffhanger. The entire game is a set up for the next game, Pirate Adventure 2. At this price, there should be some kind of resolution. It is very unsatisfying to play an entire game only to find out there is no payoff. I would even hesitate to buy the next one for fear that they will do the same thing and leave that game unfinished as well.
B0042RUMIW|5.0|I enjoyed this CD in Ensley it's an excellent recording....I would highly recommend adding it to anyones &#34; Sting collection&#34;
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Firefly is a very good sci fi show, if you don't let the mixture of Western and Sci Fi genres bother you. I don't believe it was made to be taken too seriously as some other shows are. The characters are very well written and acted. It is a series that is imaginative and intelligent. It's misunderstood. Once a person watches a couple of episodes they will probably become addicted. The cancellation of the show was due to the anti-sci fi bias that is still prevalent on television. Although, ratings and sponsorship are very important, it simply takes some shows to gain an audience. I'm hoping that Firefly is popular enough on streaming services like Amazon to have a come back.
B00280LYHS|5.0|The heroic Percy Jackson and Annabeth go on a quest to save the world (again)  and the prophecy the Oracle told Annabeth in ways they do not expect...
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Loved it. Excelent quality. A perfect addition to my collection. Can not wait until the next season comes on in October.
B004WR125O|1.0|Bought this for my recently purchased Onkyo NR616.  What a mistake!!  Any app selected resulted in failure!! I already have Wireless LAN connection on my TV.  And I have been using it for 2 years with no problem; meaning my router/wireless system is working fine.  Recommending not buying this product.  Amazon should not sell bad product like this. I'm losing confidence dealing with Amazon in future.
B004SIP9RO|5.0|Hadn't seen this movie in years. Always wanted a copy of it. One of my favorites. So glad I found it.
B00CU0UE0E|5.0|If you are looking for feel good music this is it! Upbeat and will make you want to move and sing along. Nothing serious here, just seriously fun to listen to while driving or cooking up your favorite feast!
B002RXS1NQ|5.0|Great products. Everything was received as advertised. The downloading was relatively quick. The quality is great. I recommend this seller to anyone who has interest in their products. Thank you.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Beautiful show, historically accurate, wonderful characters that you love, and love to hate!  I can hardly wait for the new season!!!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Well-written and credible.  Truly a book for Christians and non Christians to explore and ruminate over.  The book removes the trappings of mysticism and illuminates the dark past.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app cleaned up almost 2 GB for my kindle. It is very easy to use. I recommend that you download this app. You won't be disappointed!!!
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Seven seasons and Supernatural is still going strong. It made me laugh, cry, and gasp in utter horror. It went places I never expected, some I didn't like, but still it kept me loving it. Definitely worth it.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|I didn't know that I would be so engrossed in these games. I am a wordy gamer.  I wish that it came with more level but I enjoyed the free version.
031603441X|5.0|I liked this book for the rawness with which Keith wrote. He told pretty much anything you might have a question about. He talked about himself and his problems thru the years and he also talked about his interactions with the other members of the band, which I think is so important when you are member of a group people want to know about it as a whole as well about the writer's life. Good book.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|My wife and I watched it over several nights and found ourselves looking forward to each new episode in anticipation
1594744769|5.0|This is an interesting book that I loved! Some would say it was eccentric, some fantasy-like, and some may call it a thriller, it was all those. I have personally never read anything like it, nor thought of anything like it. It's definitely unique and a special gem in the book world.
B009X2CRMK|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book, and found myself rushing through the last pages to solve the mystery of what happened to Elisa.
B0049VZ222|5.0|My favorite show! All these other copy cat zombie shows and movies are a joke they don't come close! Walking Dead is as real as it gets!
B006AZZPCM|4.0|Good to have in case the official app slow to respond. Have being using for a few years now. Developer responds to queries, I've found
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love it for all the obvious reasons! I love watching friends activity. I love commenting about stuff my friends say. And I like seeing the photos that my friends post. It sort of keeps you up to date in everyone's life without having to sit down and call everybody, that's sad isn't it? Oh my God technology has taken over my life and I love it!
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|Too noisy in the beginning. Overdone. As it went along it got better.Worth watching once, it was entertaining but glad I did not pay full price to see it.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I watched all the Star Treks on reruns when I was a small child, and The Next Generation when it came out.<br /><br />I just lost interest.<br /><br />Nothing new...until now.<br /><br />Way to recreate something: make it fresh, appealing, filled with action, and ready for a few audience (and enough stuff to please an old one)<br /><br />Great job!
B000SEGTI0|5.0|I read it in high school and had the impulse to read it again. Glad I did. In the introduction to the book they describe Phillip Dick as an author who can throw out an idea in a chapter that somebody else would take a whole book to develop. That sounded about right  to me  - there are a lot of really interesting ideas in the book.
B00E0MCYPS|5.0|After opening my brand new game with the successful feeling of it being the free app of the day,I noticed right away the crisp, realistic feel of the graphics. After playing my game for a few minutes, the overly sensitive steering didn't make me mad being a laid back gamer. I spent the next few minutes laughing because of my terrible driving, so over all I guess if you want a funny game to entertain you, than this game is for you!
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|My wife and I both liked it. A lot. Great actors. Excellent story. You won't be disappointed. Very clever magic!

B00CWS3IFM|3.0|The movie is ok but not great. I read the book and the movie doesn't come close to the book. If I had authored the book I would be very disappointed in the movie.
B009VIZDLI|3.0|Liked the unique - clearly aspergers - perspective. Found the plot a little predictable but imminently readable, same goes for Rosie!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Great app I use it a lot to help with my schedule for work. I would definitely recommend this app.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is a great Google product and definitely worth the $35.  We are able to surf the net and watch lots of programs.  This product provides selected apps (netflex, googleplay, and youtube).  If you have a pc or mac you can get any program on the web.  Apple products (ipad and iPhone) still don't have the google chromecast app therefore you can't use it with these products.  I think it will be a long time until those apps are available of ipad or iPhone. Absolutely a great product that makes your TV smart but you must have HDMI port on your TV.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Great Buy!

B00ESY7QXI|4.0|...then you'll probably like this version of The Great Gatsby. I'm sure I was supposed to have read this book in high school, but since the storyline was only vaguely familiar to me, I can't say for sure if the movie did justice to the book. I suspect the film skips a lot of the more literary aspects, but still, it's a good story, and the acting was very good. You could put the party scenes next to those in Moulin Rouge and hardly be able to tell them apart - the same sort of over-the-top glitz and wild, modern music and crazy costumes. But once you get past that and the action starts to focus on Gatsby and Daisy and the terrible love triangle in which they're trapped, the plot thickens. Leo DiCaprio's acting really shines. Worth a rental!

B0012GTZC0|4.0|Follett draws you into his stories tying true history and fiction seamlessly.  A great villain and a wonderful heroine.  The book tells the story of England's effort to fool the Germans into thinking the Allies will land in Calais rather than Normandy.  One spy knows the truth and he must be stopped before he returns to Germany to warn Hitler.  Lots of action and great story-telling.

B009KS4XRO|4.0|i like the game,however today when playing  my game suddenly shut down and i lost everything i had won. then when i brought the game back up, it showed wild cards and others that would have given me thousands of dollars. this happened to me before with many wild cards that connected when i pulled the game back up after it suddenly shut down. i'm beginning to think this is done on purpose.i am very disappointed with this.
B00640UICA|4.0|Graphics and sounds are great!  And it's not all child's play - it's challenging!<br /><br />To play, you just make those that can, touch hands :)  The levels introduce new characters that do (or can't do) special things to get you through the levels.<br /><br />I play this everyday, at least once :) &lt;3

B004MYFV0O|5.0|Like other's have commented, this book gives you the basics that you need to get started without progressing to &#34;then you just to this and this and this--and voila! A masterpiece&#34;. Be prepared to put some effort into the basics though.
B009VA1FN6|4.0|Even though the story wasn't action packed there was enough to intrigue me to find out how all the pieces linked together.  I was actually impressed with how it came together.
B000FC10MU|3.0|This book is pretty good -- not the best -- but very inspirational.<br />It is a wonder how the author could've been so passionate about learning the history of past religions and applying them all into one big &#34;fanfic&#34; -- I say that term loosely.<br />The main character goes through some troubles throughout his life which eventually lead him to finding out that he is in a mix-up of a war against the gods; all of the gods.<br />This book went into serious depth of about the characters and the plot, however sometimes the book felt a little too out of place... almost as if reading a screenplay, which is odd to say: seeing how a television series is supposed to come out, soon, based on the book.<br />By no means was this a dull read, or a fast read. This book simply was one to get through and be done. Props to the author and good work -- but I feel like this is a book that I may not come to read through again for a little while.<br />Great read, with enough action and suspense to get you through-it. Neil Gaiman's: American Gods is an extraordinary read, worth any person's bookshelf. 3 stars goes to the book that had a little bit of everything.
B00AW57L96|3.0|I liked the way the story unravelled but hated the end which left a sour taste in my mouth! It was definitely a let down after the work that went into the links in the story.

B000XUBFE2|2.0|My sister recommended this book. So I purchased the Kindle version. A little difficult to follow at first. But, being a Christian, I didn't like all the profanity, and was offended by the use of the Lord's Name, so I quit reading it and deleted it from my Kindle. The story line was good. The foul language was totally unnecessary.

B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Normally I do not review the books I read...this one sang out (pun intended) to me so I had to say something. I'm a very avid reader consuming as many as 6 books a week mostly in the sci-fi/ fantasy genres. Thank you to kindle for allowing this to be possible. I found this book in the customers also bought section of another book I enjoyed(awesome feature if you have trouble finding books you might like). While it could be said to be another coming of age common to lots of fantasy stories it is so much more than that. From the scope of the world  building to the raw gut wrenching emotions provoked  from the story this is a must read for any fan of the genre. A gritty thought provoking beginning to a trilogy that promises to be epic. Bravo Mr. Ryan and I can't wait for Tower Lord and the conclusion to the story. Hurry plz

Although you do have to have videos, music, movies on your phone and I do not think you can just search for entertainment but like I said I highly recommend this app and recommend that you should buy.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Excellent movie!!! And I'm not even a comic book, super hero kind of girl!  Even our toddler loved this movie and watched it in its eentirety!!!
B00E0MCYPS|3.0|I Give This Game A 3 Star Rating. I Like The Feel Of It But There Were Times My Car Just Completely Went offtrack While I Was Driving At A Low Speed So I Could Turn On The Curves. Though, It Does Not Have An Online Play From What I've Seen At The Main Menu. It Would Be Really Great If It Did Because I Wouldn't Want To Just Play With CPUs All The Time. I Do Recommend This Game For Anybody Who'll Be Bored And Just Wanna Play A Solo Game With Challenges Or If You Want To Give A Review.
B0058Z4NR8|3.0|Virtually is nothing new in this book, it could be much shorter wish would be only beneficial for readers.  At the same time have no regrets I read it.  Greediness and humans stupidity along with group pressure was in past and will in future bring down everyone civilization.

B000OLGCI4|1.0|my children and I were so excited to recieve our used version of the jungle book DVD in the mail. as soon as loading it it started skipping BAD. we're talking a minute or less into the film. I thought maybe it needed cleaning or dusting--nothing worked. the disc skips and pauses the entire movie making it impossible to even watch. when I contacted the company goHastings I was told I had to return it with a printed label wait for my return yadayadayada. maybe I should buy new from now on, but don't sell discs you have CLEARLY never even attempted to check for problems. there's no way this disc was checked before it was sold. I've bought used DVDs from anther company who upon learning one of mine was scratched sent a replacement no questions asked EVEN AMAZON did the exact same thing with game or thrones when our discs were brand new but skipping.
0316228583|5.0|First off, I admit that I had to start this book twice to get through it.  Rowling takes a long time (the first half of the book) setting the stage for the action that comes in the second half.  But, having now read the entire book, the first half is justified.  At its core, I think that The Casual Vacancy is a character study.  Rowling is delving deep into the human heart and the human condition.  She doesn't paint a rosy picture of humanity (she didn't in Harry Potter, either, by the way).  Instead, she is candid in revealing a portion of humanity as it is: fallen, flawed, often limited by circumstance, and self-centered.  Rowling takes the time necessary to explain and examine the human beings she portrays.  These character examinations make up much of the first half of the book.  I think the difficulty in starting this book and staying with it is the lack of focus on plot in the first half of the book.  In the end, that's a great thing.<br /><br />Somewhere near the middle, after I had labored through the first part, I became fascinated with the people of Pagford.  Once I had my mind around who the people were (there are a lot of characters, and Rowling doesn't waste words explaining again and again who they are), I wanted to know more about them.  I wanted to know their motives and their fears.  That's when the action picked up, and I couldn't put the book down.  Truly, I spent two months getting through the first half of the book; I finished the second half in 24 hours.<br /><br />Having now read the book, I think it's a masterpiece.  I wonder if those who criticize the book because, they claim, Rowling painted a picture of the poor as saints and the rich as devils, really read the entire book.  I don't think she was harder on the rich than the poor.  I think she tried to show that both the rich and the poor can be flawed and that often many of our problems exist because we don't understand each other.  Further, Rowling doesn't end the book by radically changing any of the characters.  Instead, she shows that slight character transformations may be taking place in some their lives, which is, in reality, how change often occurs.<br /><br />In the end, this book has stayed with me.  It is bothersome, gritty, authentic, grotesque, real, and it has made me think about my own life and my own motives.  Rowling is a master storyteller, largely in part because she so intimately understands human beings.  She writes what she feels, and she isn't concerned about exposing truth (again, the same can be said for Harry Potter).<br /><br />So, in the end, if you have struggled with the beginning of this book, stay with it.  The end justifies the beginning, and the end wouldn't have worked without it.  The book is a masterpiece, and I'm so grateful for J.K. Rowling.  She seems like the real deal, and it is a privilege to read her work.

I wouldn't recommend this product from my experiences with it.
140006922X|5.0|Reza Aslan’s biography of Jesus opens with this quote from the gospel of Matthew: “Do not think that I have come to bring peace on earth. I have not come to bring peace, but the sword.” (10:34) Aslan’s Jesus is an angry Jewish peasant who has come to Jerusalem to drive out the moneychangers and corrupt priests of the Temple who are bleeding the people dry. Thus, the title---Zealot, one who is full of zeal, so full of zeal that one will resort to any means necessary to achieve that end, including holy war. Of course this idea of a violent Jesus is the opposite of the orthodox Christian idea of Jesus as a man of peace. But nevertheless, those militant words in Matthew, and others like them, are part of the Christian gospels.<br /><br />Part of Reza Aslan’s task in this book is to explain these contradictory portrayals of Jesus, and to do this it is necessary to make readers aware of the historical context within which the short life of Jesus is played out. First century Judea was a Roman province, and Rome ruled its subjugated provinces with an iron fist. Rebellion and even talk of rebellion was considered treason and was stamped out with torture, execution, massacre, and wholesale destruction. Rome sought to divide a conquered people by setting up puppet rulers, showing them favor, and encouraging them to keep their own people in control by any means necessary. In Jerusalem, the capital, the puppets were the high priests and elders of the Temple. They were a corrupt lot and enjoyed wealth and luxury at the expense of everyone else. Thus they were hated and had many enemies. Among the most dangerous enemies were zealous preachers, magicians, and healers who moved among the poor stirring up trouble. To the high priests, elders, and their Roman masters, Jesus was just another such troublemaker. Thus, he had to be put to death.<br /><br />Most of the conclusions Aslan presents about this “historical” Jesus have been debated by religion scholars for decades.The author does not pretend to be covering new ground in this book. In fact, his back-of-the-book notes provide more than fifty pages of very interesting documentation for his views. (This is a book where the back notes are almost as interesting as the main book matter. Aslan cites authors on both sides of the controversy. He lets you know who disagrees with him.) Even though, the historical Jesus controversy has been raging for decades now, it is telling that this book will probably be surprising and controversial among the faithful. A reaction of shock and surprise would suggest that the scholarly debates about Jesus have not filtered down to the people in the pews. As so often happens, the pastors out in the parishes have not spent a lot of time educating people about theological controversies raging in seminaries and universities, if even they themselves are aware of them.<br /><br />With Zealot, Aslan plays the role of popularizer of scholarly theological matters. He brings the debate down from the misty heights of academia and presents it as a fascinating story for the masses. One does not have to be a Christian or follower of any faith, for that matter, to be captivated by Aslan’s biography of Jesus. He has turned it into a great story. It may be quite different from “The Greatest Story Ever Told,” but it is definitely a page-turner. (And don’t forget to read the back notes.)
B001BKTEZA|5.0|A friend recommended I read the book.  I'd seen the movie a few times.  I started to look into the time period this took place and the devastation of that time.  I've had hard times in my life but what people went through was awful.<br />The detail of the book puts you in there shoes.<br />Times have changed. I hope we could have the courage today that they had.  I think we should all stop thinking we need to have.<br />We've been getting a little taste of hard times hope we learn from it.  One thing that hasn't changed is the greed of the powerful.  I correct myself nothing has changed.

0062239422|5.0|I'm going to start my review with a big, bold statement - Into the Darkest Corner is probably one of the best psychological crime mysteries I've ever read.  I read even read it whilst walking to work  (Walking people, walking!)  because I just couldn't put it down.  Now, the book had been on my shelf for nearly two years, but it was as soon as I read April at My Shelf Confessions' review, that I knew I had to read it.<br /><br />Into the Darkest Corner is the story of Catherine, who was once young and carefree with a large group of friends and a party-girl lifestyle, but now finds herself living in near-isolation and completely controlled by her OCD.  Her obsessions and compulsions are based around her need to feel 'safe' in her own home, which makes her particularly easy to be sympathetic with, as home is where everyone SHOULD feel safe, but even with all her precautions, her life is spent constantly watching over her shoulder.  But I also found myself admiring her because even with all of her rituals, she continues to try and live a normal life, going to work and trying to socialise as much as she can overcome her need to hide away from the world.<br /><br />Told in flashbacks between then and now, Into the Darkest Corner gradually builds in intensity, but the tension is there right from the beginning.  As things go from worse to worse in Catherine's life, there were times when I found myself getting quite angry - particularly with her friends who pretty much told her to stop complaining and be grateful that she had such a wonderful boyfriend.<br /><br />The real genius of this book is that Haynes actually started to make ME paranoid too - at several points I started to question whether everything was in Catherine's head or whether characters that come into her life were actually who they seemed to be, which demonstrated how living with that much tension and fear can really play with someone's mind.  And I was just reading it!<br /><br />Clever, scary, intense and addictive, Into the Darkest Corner is a book that I'd push onto anyone who enjoys psychological thrillers, crime fiction or adult fiction that really sucks you into the story and doesn't let go, even after the last page.addictive, Into the Darkest Corner is a book that I'd push onto anyone who enjoys psychological thrillers, crime fiction or adult fiction that really sucks you into the story and doesn't let go, even after the last page.
B000HL2J0G|3.0|I liked the original series mostly because of Anderson.  The first season was/is overblown and the series becomes a bit easier to take - or one's mind is more forgiving - in subsequent seasons.
0062255657|3.0|I've been looking forward to Neil Gaiman's new book for a while. I really enjoyed The Graveyard Book on audio, and I was looking forward to seeing how Gaiman writes to a more adult audience. I'd debated whether to try The Ocean at the End of the Lane in audio first, but eventually decided I wanted to see how it would read on paper.<br /><br />The Ocean at the End of the Lane is essentially a reflection on an event in the childhood of a middle-aged man, and that is pretty much the way that it becomes an 'adult' book rather than a children's book - it shows in the language particularly, as there is none of the childish enthusiasm in the writing if it had been 'live' events told through the eyes of the narrator as they happened.<br /><br />The fantastical element actually felt rather restrained to me - and that's also a comparison that I could make to The Graveyard Book - Gaiman weaves fantasy with realism so well that a lot of what happens in The Ocean At the End of the Lane has a dreamlike quality, rather than intense fantasy, and that's the kind of fantasy I like. For example, the family has NO idea what is actually happening to their son as they seem to be shielded from the events that are occuring even in their own home.<br /><br />A very quick read, I enjoyed The Ocean at the End of the Lane quite a lot, although I didn't find myself cheering for the main character as much as I would have liked - granted it's hard to connect with a nine-year-old-boy when you are a woman in your thirties, but I had expected to feel more protective and concerned than I actually did. I also had trouble discerning between the two older women at times - in part because of their names, but also because they didn't have the individual presence to distinguish themselves.<br /><br />I haven't read enough of Neil Gaiman to say how this book rates in relation to his earlier work, but I would actually recommend this one on audio - but only if it's narrated by Neil Gaiman himself (wink, wink)..

B003ODIZL6|4.0|Better than the first one..... :/ I guess. Anyway,nothing will change my mind about the dictionary I mentioned in my last review.
B005S9EJ14|2.0|It's an interesting, heartwarming story intertwined with India's beauty and culture.  A story I want to watch over and over which is why I purchased the DVD.  However, very disappointing that the DVD's color quality does not match it gloriousness on the big screen nor on cable.  Sadly, am returning my copy (first time ever to return an item to Amazon) in hopes of finding another that will be of better quality.  This is such a visual film that the loss of rich color and atmosphere on film does not do the story justice.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|This is the second best book of definitions I have read so far. Merriam-Webster Collegiate 10th Edition is probably the most accurate dictionary.
B000U6BT40|5.0|great show, great actors, very funny. I loved the story line and the fact that anything could, and did, happen.
B00CATONCA|5.0|Very good product!!! I all ready fill it with water, it's incomplete without it!!!<br />And is one of my favorites TV shows!!!
B001IAME78|5.0|Good family movie.  Kids understand why Hulk turns green and huge so no confusion about why he is angry. Lol
B009NQLT0M|5.0|Replaced noisy chipset fan without any increase in temps. Was skeptical of the premium you pay for these but they are worth it and Amazon's price was the best I could find.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|I wanted to see this movie when it was in theatres but I ended up waiting for DVD release. I have to admit, my initial reason for wanting to see this movie is because I like to watch Leo act. I have been addicted to Leo's acting skills since I saw him in &#34;The Aviator&#34;. I was completely convinced he was Howard Hughes :-). To my surprise, not only was Leo absolutely awesome in this film, I actually liked the story line. I am a complete sucker for a romantic plot, especially those with a &#34;Cinderella&#34; undertone such as this one. My stomach gets butterflies when I think about the possible reality of a man, who came from nothing, who decides to make something of himself in order to have the ONE and only woman he truly loves. In spite of the fact that he could probably have any other woman he wanted......
B005K17RU0|4.0|Great wx. app, quick and what you want to know.  I like the way it lays out the information, easy access. to.
B00DDBNJF6|5.0|Remastered so it loses a little of the tinny sound associated with original mix. Rehearsal cuts are interesting as you can hear Chuck Leavell being integrated into the band. The Winterland show discs show that version of the ABB at their best, Far better performance and sound quality than other shows available from that era.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|interesting, fun twist on typical Sci-fi. Characters are interesting, though the prostitute crew member is a bit gratuitous. The plots and dialogue are good, even if the western slang sometimes sounds forced.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Piper really makes me feel what it's like to be in a women's prison for a year.  Claustrophobic, scary, fascinating, thought-provoking.
B004HX0P2Y|3.0|Not terrible, but really could be better. Drags on a bit.  Not one I would say you have to go see, but I sat through it without complaint.
B0014H32MG|4.0|Twists and turns... King never let's you get comfortable with the plot...lots of fun and unexpected surprises with the hero.

B00ET47USI|5.0|I enjoy all formats of Solitaire and have a variety of the games on my computer and tablet.  However, this game takes Solitaire to a whole other level with its captivating graphics, animation, and sound.  It runs flawlessly on my Kindle Fire HD and it is my favorite distraction these days.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|ADDICTING!!!!  I did a marathon night and watched the whole season!  I can hardly wait for October to get here!
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|I'm not in the habit of buying this type of game, preferring word games and Solitaire, but the concept was intriguing.  I really have enjoyed it and have been challenged enough to maintain my interest.
B00008MLSH|5.0|Great selection of arias and beautiful interpretation.<br /><br />Mozart, Donizetti, Bellini, Gounod, Dvorak, and Puccini.<br /><br />Marvellous Rusalka's song to the moon interpretation.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved it!! Cant wait for the next novel. Please hurry. Don't keep your readers waiting. I love Gideon and Eva together.
B0072OFM28|5.0|I just love anything dealing with Spartacus! This is definitely my all time favorite show and I couldn't ask for anything better. The product was received in good shape and I also got it quick too.
B0095VPAVE|5.0|You can't beat this performance at this price point. Not recommended to use by itself if you plan on building a gaming rig. I've paired mine with a HD7750 and its windows index is 7.2 of 7.9. Only thing is you may want to get a bigger heatsink because the one it comes with is small for a 100w CPU. Other than that, I trust the &#34;A&#34; series and will continue to use it in future builds.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|Love this show! I love anything with Sci-fi themes and this is definitely a great show! I just recently learned about this show and it's wonderful! Also this product was received in great condition and I received it quickly as well. :)
B008AK8FHM|5.0|As an engineer, I was captivated by &#34;Proof of Heaven&#34;. It does seem like a perfect storm of medical knowledge and Near Dear Experience occurred in Dr. Alexander's life (and death?).  I appreciated how he described the detail of his NDE and carefully examined the medical impossibilities of it, piece by piece.<br /><br />I have to also say that obviously Dr. Alexander had a lot to lose by 'coming out' with this kind of information, and he still felt like he had no choice but to share it.  In his circles, would he not put his credibility as an expert up to question by sharing his experience?  So he seems to have researched the possibilities carefully in order that his findings would withstand professional scrutiny. That meant a lot to me.<br /><br />&#34;Proof of Heaven&#34; is well-written and compelling.  Not just a narrative of an NDE, &#34;Proof of Heaven&#34; provides scientific evidence to back up the life-beyond-death experience. It is a bit heavy on scientific and medical terminology, making it a more advanced read. Obviously that is one of the reasons this book is different from some of the other books about NDEs and evidence of Heaven.
B00CTKHXFO|3.0|The art book sucks to put it lightly. I expected something like the other ones like the one in the HD collection bundle. The &#34;2 Exclusive Ashley Wood Bande Desinee Graphic Novels&#34;... I expected to be hard copies but I guess it's downloadable or on the disc somewhere. (I haven't actually looked since I own all the games before purchasing this, just really wanted the physical books/ what I thought were books.)<br /><br />The games included are amazing though. If you don't own them already, this is an amazing deal. This is easily my favorite game series. Hilarious, clever, and super enjoyable game play.<br /><br />Overall, buy for games, not books.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|They only thing that I believe I don't like about this show is the opening music. The rest is excellent! As a fan of Wardruna, I got chills when their music was played in some parts of the show. Now if you could somehow fit some Amon Amarth.<br /><br />Definitely looking forward to the next season, and will eventually pick this up on blu-ray.

B008AIGWVA|2.0|Seemed to me that additional options for this app had to be paid for in order to properly use the app. Could not do much without purchasing options
B000FCK65W|5.0|This is a good book. I loved the writing style, enjoyed so much a good writing. The story is great, it was not fast reading, but I would always recommend this book. This is the one you would always want on your book shelf.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|After watching the first three seasons we can't wait until the next season is available. Let us know when it is available.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Yes it was a fast reading, interesting story, sometimes it looks unreal to me when somebody is so manipulative like a main character. It's not the type of book I like to read, I usually like to read something I can learn from. This was just the mystery book not bad if you like these types of stories.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Very captivating. Enjoyed it very much. A little confusing at the beginning of each chapter as it introduced yet another new character.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I never watched this series with any constancy but decided to start with the pilot episode.  My new favorite show. No kidding, I watched the first season straight through in one day.  Now I need to get through all five seasons on Amazon so I can watch on tv.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|like it a lot , it requires some thinking ,great time passer! Should have some hints though ! otherwise ok
B00007KWHN|5.0|This CD, the third release for Yes, is the most listenable and enjoyable of this group for me, followed closely by the CD Fragile. Steve Howe really did add the needed ingredient to pump up the the progressive rock sound of Yes. It was nice to have added tracks on this CD as well. The Yes Album CD takes me back to seeing Yes in a small outdoor stadium after Rick Wakeman joined for Fragile in the early 1970's.

B008HK3XU4|4.0|Just received the KIndle 7 and standing case today.  Haven't used<br />them enough to rate them. I haven't even started reading yet as I'm currently<br />too busy with other projects.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is a great sequel to the first book.  It keeps your interest the entire time. And  has so many surprises. Keeps you on edge the entire book. I can't wait to read the next one.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|I loved the original move and was hooked immediately on the series. I recommend the series to any Sci fi fan.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This book about Jesus is the best I ever read,<br />,<br />. It is easily read, interesting of concept, and scholarly at the same time
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I love stories about time travel and the possibilities inherent in just traveling to a time and being alive in a different stage of your life than you otherwise would have been. This is a great story, thoughtful and with painful consequences as a result of trying to change a past that resists being changed. Well worth reading and it kept me riveted until I finished it. Highly recommend it!
B000SEIBB8|5.0|This is a great book for software developers.<br />A lot of us younger programmers have been expose to many design patterns directly in the language architecture or in pre-design software and frameworks. This mask a lot of the basic understanding of why and when a design pattern should be used. fortunately this book takes it back to the basic and creates a retrospective &#34;A ha&#34; moments and understanding
B001NOD0Q8|4.0|Great book, read this before you see the movie- new intro by author really great. Worth the time to read.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|One of the most inspirational and motivational book to date.<br />Highly recommended for everyone looking to step back from the chaos of everyday life and try new approaches.
B00DQVSTCG|1.0|Gutted after waiting so long for this (one of Madonna's best ever tours finally available to watch at home) - but I seem to have one of the defective Blu Rays.  Picture looks like an old analogue TV broadcast where the reception was bad. The Blue Ray of this concert is appalling, it is missing audio tracks, so the sound quality is totally terrible, the image is grainy and inferior, something has gone wrong in the duplication of this Blue Ray - Blue Ray is meant to be sharp, crisp, vivid and HD this one looks and sounds worse than an old VHS video copy of a copy.<br /><br />The tour was amazing, I made it to the pit, I was looking forward to the first Blue Ray of a Madonna concert, the blue rays have been recalled in other countries but not in the US, Live Nation and Universal know there is a problem.<br /><br />A very bad quality Blue Ray, alas I think the other 5 star reviews were made before they actually saw the Blue Ray and they were reviewing the original tour or the webcast of it NOT the blue ray.<br /><br />DO not buy the Blue Ray until they reissue a fixed version, it is an utter waste of money.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Great story told from a different prespective. Enjoyed it very much.  Easy reading but very inspirational. Would recommend to friends.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love love love! Don't read without reading the first one though so much more in the first book the movie skipped on, best book of the whole series
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game! I enjoyed it greatly and could play this game for hours... I may even download another version for even more fun.
B00DPKQ60A|4.0|Ok I wanna start by saying that I am not a much a pop music fan, I mostly listen to Rap. I don't really even like Demi Lovato or Selena Gomez. And nowadays we have Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber and it's kinda sad to see where music is heading. But I have to say I like Ariana Grande. She's proven to be a great singer with some songs I actually listen to. She's only 20 years old and already with so much talent.<br /><br />Lyrics) - I find pop songs to have some really lame lyrics and that's partly why I'm not a fan. But Yours Truly has some good ones. I like some of the originality, I like her heartfelt messages, I like this album. She reminds me a lot of Mariah Carey.<br /><br />Instrumentals) - Another thing I don't like about pop music: You can't find a pop song these days without having to hear some uptempo disco beat, which was fun at first, but now it's predictable any old. But once again Ariana Grande has done her own thing, these instrumentals are much different than that of say, Demi Lovato's. Quite piano-ish which at this point I'd rather listen to than some Techno Choirs with an unoriginal line about love. I like how she's working with some hip-hop artists aswell (As I said above I'm a big fan of rap). It's very pleasing.<br /><br />Personal Opinion) - I've stated much of my opinion throughout this review; I'd just like to add my favorite songs are: Honeymoon Avenue, Baby I, and You'll Never Know. Least favorite probably Lovin' It, and The Way, but only cuz I had to hear it 15 million times on the radio. The album wasn't perfect to my tastes but probably is to someone more a fan of pop music. Solid debut album, I definitely recommend it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Great pop album<br />Nice writing and emotion<br />Good collaborations<br />Definitely more originality than in other pop albums<br /><br />Cons:<br />I'm not gonna do cons since I feel I can't accurately state my dislikes of the album according to my tastes in music.<br /><br />Rate 1/10: 8.2
B00319ECGK|3.0|The matrix is my favorite movie of all time, but I'm not here to review the movie itself.  I'm here to review the quality of the blu-ray disc.  I was very disappointed.  Sure, blu-ray is higher quality, but in this movie, the difference between the blu-ray version and the dvd version is very little.  The extra money and expectations are not worth it.<br /><br />I'm going to stick to the dvd's until I see a compelling reason to switch.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I love the story, and the work of the actresses, They do a wonderful job telling the story of the struggles of black women in the south during the fifties, and sixties. Very compeling.
B003U53GK8|5.0|Although Season Six got a little &#34;out there&#34; I still love the show overall.  It captivated me like no other show ever has.  If fact I've watched all six seasons over again.  I LOVE Matthew Fox, Josh Holloway, Evangeline Lilly and ALL of the cast!  They all did an outstanding job and I look forward again to the day when I enjoy another show as much!  I hope to see all of the cast in other shows.  This show is a must see!  Start with season 1.  It will hook you right away!

B00DHSK3RM|3.0|This app only takes you to videos on Youtube ,not a true guide to the game ,was really bad too
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I thought this book was just okay. There really wasn't much of a plot and not much action, unless your really into a lot of sex scenes, then you could say there was a whole lot of action! I hope the next book in this series is a lot better.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|This game is very simple, and yet makes you think. My whole family loves it and have been playing it almost every day since we got it.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|By far the best movie I have seen in years. Wonderful characterizations with humor and touching moments that tell this real life story. Sound track is also excellent!
B00280LYIM|3.0|Same as my title...up<br /><br />It was an ok-medium I wouldn't try to hurt Ricks feelings<br />HE'S A GREAT AUTHOR SO DON'T TAKE THIS DOWN THE<br />WRONG RODE YOU HEAR ME!!! But yeah he's a great author<br />I just think he could have done a better job on this book
1250029465|5.0|I'm a sucker for an animal story.  Especially a cat story.  And author James Bowen has quite the story to tell about how a ginger colored street cat named Bob came to save his life.<br /><br />In London in 2007, James Bowen was climbing his way out of the rock bottom that he had hit.  He was an addict whose heroin habit rendered him homeless, jobless and estranged from his family.  In a methadone program and in \\"sheltered accommodations\\", James supported himself by \\"busking\\"~~he played music on a street corner relying on the benevolence of passersby to give him tips.  The last thing James needed was another mouth to try to feed.  Yet, as it turns out, the very thing James needed was what he got~~Bob.<br /><br />Bob showed up battered and sickly.  James, having been around cats his whole life, just couldn't let Bob suffer.  It was only supposed to be two weeks of antibiotics and then James was going to let Bob go back out into the world.  He'd give him his freedom.  Turns out, all Bob really wanted was to be with James.  Whether he was \\"busking\\" with James or helping James through his darkest hours, a street cat named Bob became the author's saving grace.<br /><br />This is a true story.  This is a love story.  A story of survival.  A story of hope and heartache.  Written as a conversation between reader and author, you'll find yourself completely engaged in the story of James and Bob.  Congratulations to James Bowen.  You've written a wonderful book and I look forward to reading the next \\"Bob Book\\".<br /><br />And to Bob, gimme a high-five buddy!
B00280LYHS|5.0|I loved this book...WHAT IN THE NAME OF NACHI CROCHI!!!<br />HOLY CHING CHONG DING DONG THIS BOOK IS FUNNY!!!!.<br /><br />This book was mostly funny,kinda romantic___hehe,and near the end was kinda sad cause Luke was a great character...I feel bad for the guy.<br />  Actually I didn't hate any of this...I LOVE IT...I LOVE IT!!!I LOVE IT SO MUCH I MIGHT TEETEE MYSELF RIGHT NOW AS WE SPEAK!!!AHAHAHA!!!! 0_0.sorry
B00514HDNW|4.0|I found the book to be really interesting.  Richard Matheson also wrote a screenplay for it called &#34;The Last Man on Earth&#34; starring Vincent Price back in 1964.  It was one of Price's more memorable performances because of the script.  Anyway, I found the story interesting.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Best game ever! Love it since I can't have a real horse!<br />I highly recommend this app if you love horses and fun!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Myself daughter and I enjoy the steps that you have to take to escape. Then room escapes are a great way to show how cause and effect surrounding our days. Actions and their consequences how we learn.
B004X80QNG|2.0|Good tought...just not complete. Not enough widget options and widgets dont scroll agenda. Can not create multiple widgets for different calendars either. Disappointing but at least I didnt pay for it. Uninstall
B00AF82WTO|5.0|I love it! Like most films it can't give you to same in depth character development a novel can but this particular version is stunning. Beautifully filmed in sunny old Devonshire, Sally Hawkins gives a mesmerizing performance. I loved it.
B004SC7B6M|5.0|Nice sound. I love Within Temptation so I was very excited about this new album. It was excellent. I like to listen to this as I am laying in bed trying to sleep. I think I pretty much have all their albums. I am a long time fan.
B001LF3YQK|3.0|I was expecting something about half the size of this.  It was too big for the diaper bag.  I ended up buying the Huggies travel case (that holds about 20 wipes).  This stays in the stroller instead.
B008602KQI|4.0|I have read many books turned movies, for example \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and \\"The Hunger Games\\".  I chose these two to state the difference in keeping with the storyline of the book.  After reading The Hunger Gamer, I could not wait for movie... I wanted to see how it would turn out.  In my head, I had 5 key parts that were essential to the movie, and then subparts of that. I was not able to see it in the movies, so I had to wait for it to released on Blu-ray, so once released I watched it.  I think the director skimmed through the book, because it follows the book to point, but the KEY feature were mostly lies.  The biggest issue I had, was the PIN (the Mockingjay).  In the book, she did not find that PIN at the market.  It was given to her, prior to the start of games, When Madge came to bid Katniss farewell she offered it to her as a symbol of District 12 and made her promise to wear it in the arena.  That a crucial moment that was completely left out and misrepresented.  At least, The Da Vinci Code kept the story and script as one.  There was not much that they Changed.  But I was very Disappointed with the Hunger Games.  They really let down the readers of the book with this movie.  Hopefully, they do not make the same mistake with Catching Fire. Besides the fact it did not match the movie perfect, it was a great movie, if you did not read the book.
B00821OX98|5.0|This show is awesome. I am really enjoying it.  About to start season three and looking forward to it. Excellent
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|I have two young girls.  They know all the characters names, sing the songs, and act out the parts!  It is a very nice musical that the whole family enjoys!<br />There is a nice feature of a sing along.  The movie plays though but with the words of each song shown on the screen.  My girls love the feature as it clarify's the words at times.  It also gives them confidence to sing because they have the words in front of them.  Great purchase!
B007RV5T1U|5.0|Very inspiring, she was amazing. The documentary is very well done and present very well the life of pina baush
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Compelling series worth watching.  Draws you in from the first episode. You'll want to view the whole season.  Well worth the time - full of quirky surprises.

B005URRCUY|5.0|Very rarely these days do I enjoy listening to an album all the way through. This one is great. Must have.
B00E978FGQ|5.0|Magic is a wondrous topic of entertainment itself .  Add a heist to it and Morgan Freeman  it is a delight beyond compare.  do buy this movie because you will want to watch again and again.  Very Complex.  Very very Good!
B000JCSPG0|5.0|It isn't perfect, but I love this movie every time I watch it.  Great nerd flick.  Modern viewers, appreciate the effects for when it was made.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The only thing is too many adverting pop ups but otherwise great game and I play it all the time!
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|A second generation of Judge Dredd and not as entreating.  See the original and skip this version unless you like the premise.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I had a hard time getting involved for the first few chapters, but about a quarter of the way through I couldn't put it down. Beautifully written!
B00406O7YK|5.0|What can you say about a great musical that doesn't lose it charm on the big screen.  Look for the young original Phantom of the Opera.
1587143879|4.0|Considering each book is 40 dollars and this library guide include both book. I think it was an amazing deal for price. The information in the book is well put together and will help me not only in certification but also at work. If you are in the Networking field and don’t know what a CCNA is this is a great place to start, learn and be in networking. Warning, the information present in these books may be difficult to follow if you are not familiar with the fundamentals of the technology. While CISCO would love for you to believe they invented it all, the RFC and IEEE are good references. Just remember the right way is CISCO way on the test ;)
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|It was a really fun and good game and I really like it and there is nothing I dislike about it
B00E0MCYPS|4.0|the game is great! for those having a difficult time controlling the car, try turning off the auto throttle. with it on its like driving with your foot to the floor all of the time. great job devs.

B009NQZVKG|5.0|Just finish reading the book and loved every word. I can't wait for more by James Rollins and sigma force
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I love this app. plain and simple. it's my main alarm clock. I could never get used to the stock alarm app, but the sheer amount of control you have over all the alarms, as well as the timer, make this the best one for someone who needs a lot of alarms.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I love the historical background, it uncovers a different time an yet the same old problems remain for us all.
B00E0MCYPS|3.0|This game was good pick for free. I picked it for the graphics. That was okay, but sounds and control are not that good. Not sure if there is any slated upgrades to make these better, so grab this while it's free to enjoy a decent game
B0052OZJQO|5.0|Very good indeed but it would be better if it have included all of the pieces in Pina the film.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Beautifully written account of the intertwining families of the Tall Oaks plantation family. Suspense, fear, joy and incredulousness overcame me throughout the story. A great read.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Absolutely terrific muffin full of timey whimy fun for anyone over the age of 10 David tennant in his prime
B008Y768XO|3.0|It was a very, very sad movie! I would have stopped watching it except for the fact that I thought it was going to pick up and change back to happy. Should only watch it if you need a good cry! (Which I didn't!)
B0089EHWQE|5.0|great writing, kept me interested throughout.  Showed how life is full of twists and turns and what you expect doesn't always happen.
B005LHO274|5.0|The version is slightly updated from the version on the Google Play store - the change log says fixed to run on the Kindle Fire HD. Since the Kindle Fire HD doesn't have a compass, the software can't automatically line up the display view with the horizon. (Maybe the next version of the KFHD?) Still, a nice program even if you have to manually look around by dragging the screen. This is a first impression, I was very pleased with the initial look and am off to play with the other displays.
B00846TTDG|4.0|Beautifully done.  At times, I thought the acting was a bit stilted, but, at the end, when I saw that the &#34;actors&#34; were the actual people, I was awe struck.  Worth watching
B004R0WKNE|5.0|YEARS ago, I myself worked for 6 years in live broadcast news (financial news) in what began as a very small studio in Santa Monica and later in Culver City, Los Angeles...so this movie really spoke to me. It was a hell of a lot of fun to watch. Reminded me a lot of my old live-broadcast days. I really enjoyed the snarky interplay between Harrison Ford and Diane Keaton. They're two veteran actors with a lot of talent and very entertaining. I really lost it, laughing hard... watching what the producers put that poor weather-guy thru! LOL - there was a young woman on our local news channel who used to do all those kinds of stories - she'd go on thrill rides, she'd go face exotic creatures at the zoo or county fair, she even went up in one of those jet fighter planes that zoom straight up into the sky, and they shot it all LIVE while she was doing it. It was hilarious! And altho' I understood that Rachel McAdams and Patrick Wilson's characters (Becky & Adam) were supposed to be the stars of this romantic comedy... I saw for the most part that Becky was in a relationship with her JOB and everything else was secondary to that.(personally I don't find a problem with that - So now women can be just as completely obsessed with their jobs or careers as men have always been?? so what?? and yet, many of them still managed to find supportive mates who had their own career paths and/or personal lives but could still make the relationship work) I know in the end Becky found a way to not let work take over her whole life so she could actually give some of herself to Adam... but I didn't find that as satisfactory. I agree that everyone has to find a happy medium between work and their relationships. Its a delicate balance, requiring TONS of compromise and patience & understanding from both partners. And some people are more able or willing to compromise than others. (I think those are the people who are the most happy in the end)  It was also an interesting POV that she chose the &#34;family&#34; at IBC over the impersonal (but more highly paid and more demanding) job at the Today Show. (is it &#34;the devil you know...&#34; kinda choice? LOL)  I myself had that very decision once, when the little station I worked at for 6 years finally got noticed and bought out by CNBC & they moved everything (but NOT everyONE) back east to New Jersey. I chose to stay in L.A. But I always wondered what would've happened if I had moved with the network. Ah well... who knows?  I really REALLY enjoyed this movie a lot, for many personal reasons. I am also going to get my husband to watch it too - he also worked for quite a few years in two different local TV stations, so I know he'll love the reminders of those days too.#34;family&#34; at IBC over the impersonal (but more highly paid and more demanding) job at the Today Show.

B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Plenty of action and sub plots.  Enjoyable long time reading.  Plenty of inside tech stuff to keep our heads buzzing.
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|If you are expecting an updated version of the original movie, then you will not be happy. This movie stands alone, and I found it very well done. Dreed is there, with the same personality, but in a totally new story. Open mind, and enjoy.
B0092R66T6|5.0|Very well done much action from start to finish, more movies should be made like this. I  would recommend seeing
B00A285OOW|5.0|I Have always enjoyed Philippa Gregory.  Historical novels are a favorite,.  Looking forward to many more about the Cousin's War.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|In my view, The Sound of Music could arguably be the film of the century or even the greatest film ever made.<br />With wonderful panoramas in the Austrian Alps, good versus evil and wonderful music and story line and spot<br />on cinematography.  All the acting is first rate and believable and what is better that it is a true story.<br /><br />I remember it with fond memories as my first ever boy girl date.  What is even more remarkable, in the city<br />where I lived the movie played for over a year in the same theatre.  I know of no other movie with that kind<br />of legs and people are still watching 45 years later.  Thus my view that it is the greatest movie of all time
B009XIXVU6|5.0|well written - great story and Hosseini's work is always worth the time to read- enjoyed it very much !
B001QOGYFO|5.0|Kate Beckinsale is  indeed the lead and pretty to look at.  But no one mentions that<br />this movie also has an aging VIPER from Top Gun in the person of Tom Skerrit.  He<br />always turns in a spot on performance and it is not different in this movie.<br /><br />I always like thrillers and murder mysteries which this movie really is.  I also<br />like strong women characters who are also vulneralbe which Kate Beckinsale portrays<br />admirably in this film.<br /><br />This movie is up to any suspense thriller. It has all the elements, bad guys, good guys<br />and greed, coupled with murder.<br /><br />I liked it.  It is a great date movie because both men and women will like it for different<br />reasons.
B003D81NVQ|5.0|Love this show. Walt's journey to becoming Heisenberg is a hoot qnd never disappoints. Can't wait to start watching the next season.<br />I'm not in danger, I AM THE DANGER!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like it! I like it!  You really have to look at the little things.  It's a lot of fun.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Really like the story line and the character portrayal.  Would have liked more episodes in the series.  Actors are very believable.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|As I read more and more of King (which is to say, I've read all his fiction), I find that he is writing love stories.  This book, like &#34;Joyland&#34;, is a beautiful and poignant love story.  Thank you, Mr. King, for another story that made me cry.
0394826817|5.0|i have not seen this book, as it was ordered for my granddaughters in another state,  i am sure they will enjoy it.  richard scarry is a good author.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|Waiting for company to reply. They owe me money for the coins I bought through Amazon. I deleted the game from my new phone. They were different versions, Amazon and Google. I was pissed. What the cards in your hand change. Watch the other players get new hands. Watch as you earn coins and they don' appear in the total.
0920668372|5.0|this book was ordered for my granddaughters in another state.  i have read it before and it is very well written and enjoyable.
B009P3N1GI|5.0|Sanderson has taken an origination idea and built an enthralling world around it. Read this book, you wont regret it
B00DYTKKGI|2.0|This game was just another version of all the other<br />doctor, hospital, dentist type games.  Granddaughter<br />gave it up very quickly.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have and still do enjoy this version of solidtaire. I especially like the way it times my plays and keeps score. It encourages me to try harder each time to try and set new records for myself.
B000I9X53W|5.0|I love this movie, always have!  Bill Murray, Dustin Hoffman, Jessica Lange, Terri, Garr,Charles Durning, Gena Davis...Dustin plays Dorothy with such heart.  It's adorable!
B00CTEP7O4|4.0|With no spoilers:  I enjoy clever, dialog-heavy tv shows / movies --this fits the bill.  The characters are quirky and interesting.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|Bogart is simply the best.  This movie is timeless.  I recommend this to anyone who believes today's movies even compare!
B00CT2P6VA|1.0|It was mind numbing.  Just clearing pearls, maybe we didn't get far enough into; however, for us it was not a winner.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was simply gripping, a roller-coaster of betrayals and compromises that kept my interest throughout. One of those books you have to wolf down in short order.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book and all the rest of the books in the series aresome of the best books I've ever read. Jace is the best developed and intricately woven character I've ever read. You can't help but fall in love with him as well as the entire world that cassandra clare has created. Nothing short of amazing!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Haven't finished reading it and I can't help but feel that the strange bacterial/viral infection he had could have been responsible for his unusual experiences. An easy read but I can't get motivated enough to finish the book. Maybe later...
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Entertaining, with some great twists and turns.  Jesse Eisenberg is as usual annoying, but the rest of the cast are great and the action is well-staged and well-paced.  If you enjoy heist movies, you'll have a good time with this one.
B004J09ONG|5.0|I read the books as a child and later enjoyed the movie. I thought the lions were wonderful. I cannot imagine the training that went into filming the movie with all of the animals. The acting was a little stilted in hindsight and the roles stereotypical by today's standards. However, Joy Adamson did so much to raise awareness of the beauty of Africa and the majesty of the animals. I hope because of her efforts, there are photo safaris not hunting safaris.
B008OM0EDO|3.0|This is a very dumb movie, but I think I like it a little. The scene of Sacha Baron Cohen's penis is thankfully short.
B0063GORYU|3.0|Found it difficult to quit an existing game, whether win or lose. The only way I knew how was to keep tapping the undo button to revert to the beginning of the game and closed the program.
B00E5Q1LTY|3.0|I was expecting more.  Same camera angles and special effects that Star Wars came out with 7 yrs ago.  It just didn't seem as original as the first remake [hm, that might not make sense, but hopefully you get what I am talking about].
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It's a great book.  I would reccomend this book. Be prepared to cry...a lot. It definitely changed my view of cancer patients.
B0099114WO|1.0|This is a horrible movie which is such a shame because I like both Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones. Seriously who in their right mind wants to hear about Tommy Lee Jones' sexual fantasies or see Meryl Streep perform sexual favors. In all seriousness the movie previews were much better than the actual movie (I might actually look into Playing for Keeps!). I expected this movie to be more along the lines of It's Complicated which was a very cute movie. With that said, Hope Springs is not funny in the slightest in fact it is just creepy. Also the sound in this movie is ridiculous and distracting (which might be not be so bad all things considered). Oftentimes the background music is waay to loud even playing louder over the actors while they are speaking and the songs are really strange.
B004XUMMFE|4.0|Well casted, intelligently written television show. Given its quirky character, it was disappointing but not surprising that the show did not last more than a season.
B000PUV1ZI|4.0|This movie is a bit dated, but still holds up. It's worth it for the sets and Dustin Hoffman, but the twists on the traditional story and the sense of wimsy make it a must-see.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this game.  It was not to difficult yet very relaxing.  The story was a great mystery.  I look forward to Maple Creek 2!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wonderful characters.  Love Maggie Smith. Love the dynamics between upstairs and downstairs and how world events and changes affect their world.
B00E0MCYPS|2.0|Played with it a bit and there seems to be a problem with either too large of a steering dead zone or with under steer. Problem appeared in both tilt and screen pressed steering options. Auto-gas feature, not that Is use it much, is poorly implemented as it is very lead-footed. All these combined make it difficult to drive even the straightest of lines. I'll keep this FAOTD and hope it gets patched in the future.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|It's fun, exciting, entertaining, beautiful colors and nice music.  Hours of fun for anyone that gets addicted... Your are warned! :~)
B008469DGY|4.0|great tool to past the time. Great graphics and challenging enough to make it fun but not too hard initially
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Only problem is I can't understand some parts of it, might sound dumb but I still use it once in a while.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I had never seen this series before starting to watch it on my Kindle. It is great. I can't wait each night to watch another episode. Thanks Amazon.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Great for solitaire gamers, good for taking your mind off other things specially when you are at an appointment. ...
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Heavy on special effects, shallow on script and character development. Too much is unexplained and you just know there's gonna be issues when the first five minutes are spent attempting to make things clear, with limited success. More Morgan Freeman and less Tom Cruise would have also made it better.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I'm excited about this product because it gets Google in the game for living room home entertainment.  I currently have Apple TV in the living room and a couple IPads and IPhones in the house. I finally received my Chromecast last week. The price is great and setup was easy. However, in terms of additional capabilities to my current setup, it does not offer much other allowing me to &#34;AirPlay&#34; Netflix from a device to the TV which is not a very big win when Apple TV already offers access to Netflix and much more.  But, if you don't yet have Apple TV (probably because you did not like the price), this is a no brainier cheap pickup for most all the same major capabilities.
B0025VLELQ|5.0|A nicely done transition to blu ray for a happy childhood memory. Not the most amazing sci if experience ever, but totally worth the nostalgia.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is simple and fun! I use 4 fingers to catch the big batch of fruit. My kid enjoys this game, and loves the sounds and music associated with this game.<br /><br />Try this game, oh and watch out for the bombs!
B00124PXW8|5.0|A masterpiece, though the first act runs too long.  Never been equaled.  I hope that no one gets the idea to remake it.  It's perfect.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I can't believe how much fun this game was. I was addicted to catching humans swimming and thought is was hilarious when catching people on the shore. I wish there was a human tracking beacon so I could eat more humans!!! Ahhhh. LOL. Great game, great concept, try it out.
B008469DGY|4.0|Very fun app to play. Great way to spend some down time.  Easy to play but WAY fun. Nothing complicated, just flick and swipe and watch your shot get close to the pin.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is a lot of fun!!! It keeps me entertained when I am on a road trip or just in the car riding.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is something like the brave game.  running and jumping so you don't get caught.  grandkids love to play it.
0793518326|5.0|Book is in better condition than described and arrived way faster than expected.  It really does have the musical notation and tabs for every Beatles song and I consider an excellent find.  Now if I could just get better on the guitar.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|this is kind of fun to see which way the fruit is coming in.  you have to be fast to get them.
B007HO392S|4.0|Bought it as a gift,  but I get to hear it all of the time.  A good album, and I like Carrie Underwood as well.<br />If you don't have it,  it's a good one to get.
B0058VW36U|5.0|this is a neat game.  you have to think about the best way to get everything in the way you need it.
B000093BDX|5.0|One of the best Beach Boy albums to have.... throw the top down,  load up the CD, and let it play while you enjoy the ride. LOL
B001BZRUR4|4.0|This is a great book and Markus Zusak is an amazing author. My only complaint is that it is a little unbelievable at times, however it does not make the writing or story any less interesting. I noticed some people marked the book all the way down to 1 star due to the books \\"unrealisticness\\" at times. I argue that it IS a work of fiction and sometimes what makes a story brilliant is its \\"unbelievableness.\\" Zusak is an amazing writer and captured me with the first sentence. I will continue to read his works.
0545265355|5.0|Good quality, especially for the price,  and a good set to get.  They love it as well, and didn't put them down until they were thru all 3 books.
B00E978FGQ|5.0|Wow...this has to be the best movie I've seen in years. A real mental roller coaster that has you going until the end, and then thinking about all the scenes when it's over. PLEASE, PLEASE make a sequel (I've never thought any movie should have a sequel, let alone say it in a review). Bravo! Bravo!
B003TOMAPC|4.0|Funny movie, but be warned there is a lot of gore and language.  Kinda like kill bill meets super troopers.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I had a similar game on my mobile, but this one is much better having many different levels. I quite enjoy the sounds for the different types of tiles and the fact it rates you with stars, so even more addictive to try and bet your previous time. Highly recommend if you need a game that will fill a few minutes of time.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Great for reading at unplanned times. Use on my phone often.\ when caught in a long line or waiting at the doctors office.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My husband enjoys as much as I do.  Can't wait for the next seasons!! Sure wish the US would take note & follow your foot steps with good quality shows! Thank You...
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Page turner for geek fans! It was a davinci code-esque read as far as staying up late goes. Very suspenseful and fun!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I really like the storyline of this series. I am looking forward to reading the next book and everyone of them after that.
0887307280|5.0|I had read this book 30 years ago. As I'm transferring control of a family business to my children I fould it yet again invaluable in explaining how a nd why a business works.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The kids like it, the husband likes it ,I like it. Overall fun game. :) Would recommend for anybody who likes a better version of temple run.
B009NX61JY|3.0|I like feel-good romantic movies and this one explores an original idea - whether two people can marry for friendship but keep romance at a distance. Of course this can only work when they both agree on the terms. There's also some good commentary on teaching styles (both main characters are professors) - that most of us can identify with.
082221539X|5.0|I have read the Christmas carol script twice now in prep for a possible part in an upcoming production. It provided me with a great review for what the story line was since I had not seen the play nor the movie in a long time. It gave me a great feel for the emotions and the background and setting. I feel ready to audition and get a part in this great classic.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love it love it love it and love some more!<br />And dont need to write any more! !!! Mmmmm<br />What else.
B00CW7KK9K|3.0|Left it in my pocket, put the wash on. I thought it was dead. Took a few days of drying out and it started to work again.<br /><br />I mainly purchased this for the sleep monitoring since Zeo is no longer around.<br />The other features of the Pulse can already be done with your phone. For instance I use Azumio's Argus and Heart Rate apps provide pedometer and instant heart rate results, and they will also talk with the Withings app. Other apps can track your altitude, and I am sure there are plenty of sleep apps too.<br /><br />I find the sleep function of the Pulse to be a little too basic compared with my Zeo, and suspect there are apps that probably provide a similar standard of info. The Pulse doesn't seem to know if I wake at night, unless I physically get up. Also the \\"deep sleep\\" appears to include REM sleep and is not as accurate as the Zeo.<br /><br />It is a nifty bit of tech that's for sure. However I can't help feel that the information it provides can already be obtained with your existing smart phone.<br /><br />BTW I have and love the Withings scale and blood pressure monitor. And the Withings app is totally awesome.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love love this game it's so much fun just love the ponies always have!!!  I'm addicted! Want more much much more!!!
B000SW2F80|5.0|its a childhood favorite and i love it. it brings back memories that i had to share with my own children
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|I bought this DVD about 2 months ago after seeing it for the first time at a friend's home.  I've lost count as to how many times I've watched it.  A beautiful and haunting sequel to it's like wise predecessor.
0765325950|5.0|This book WAS Tarmon Gai'don.  Nothing made me sadder than Jordan's death and although Sanderson did his best to do an admirable job things didn't quite feel the same to me.  I still loved this final installment and it really brought everything together for me.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love playing bingo it so much fun and the more team mates you have the better you can collect point while yours friend play download connect to Facebook then add me Myra Proudmom Whitfield I live in Philadelphia Pa I'm always looking to meet new team mates to share prizes and coins power ups or whatever
B005BZQVJ8|4.0|Hilarious. My wife and I watched together and were still laughing at some of the scenes all the next day.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Samurai versus zombies is an awesome game that is a combination of fighting zombies and being a ninja it's cool
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Never a dull moment. Very good special effects. The good guys take a licking and come back to win the day.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Simply love it!! It's easy to use.  I can read out of it where ever I go!!! I have this on my phone too!
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|These songs are so great and are worth the 6$ for sure! My favorite is Bravado! Would absolutely recommend it! Loved it!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is the best game that i hav  seen so far.  Its so addicting an  i cant put it down. Everyone should have this game
B004X80QNG|4.0|Don't believe what other  are saying! I almost didn't install this because of all the negative reviews, but this app works very well on my Kindle Fire HD.  The interface is straightforward and full of customizing options to make it the personal planner that YOU want.  The only thing I don't like about it is that it doesn't seem to allow the user to add other calendars that may be synced to your google account - but that may just be because I haven't figured it out yet.  Try it out!
B005QYKD4I|4.0|While story is pretty lacking I feel, I think then action in the Transformers movies is what's great. Sometimes a fella just wants to see stuff get blown up!
B0002XMKYE|5.0|Some movies  just seem to get better with age. Being retired military, I liked the movie and the plot was well written. George C Scott did an excellend job.
B00AEKFLOQ|5.0|Love this movie!, had to buy it on bluray a third time to get this steel book. Great art on the cover and on the inside. You won't be disappointed
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|Excellent romantic historical fiction set in Scotland and the New World.  They are long books, but I can't put them down they are very good.
0446572985|4.0|For a long time, David Baldacci has been one of my favorite authors. I always look forward to seeing a new book by him. I find Will Robbie to be a fascinating character. What amazes me is how Baldacci writes a novel with mostly action scenes and little dialogue. But for him, it works! I found &#34;The Innocent&#34; to be a real page-turner.<br />I wonder if Baldacci will ever return to writing of the Camel Club, one of my favorite set of characters.<br />I remember his first published novel, &#34;Absolute Power.&#34; That got me hooked on his books and I've read most of his books since then. I've liked about two-thirds of them, but I'm a fussy reader. I've liked his protagonists Oliver Stone (John Carr), Sean King and Michelle Maxwell, John Puller, and now Will Robie. I hope Baldacci can keep writing for a long time. I'm a loyal fan now.<br />- Victory Crayne
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|As the previous novels in the Millenium saga, it's impossible to put it down. i hope there was a number four.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|I was not a fan of IM2 so I didn't think the 3rd installment would be good but it was great fun.  Terrific Friday night entertainment.  Acting was solid, action was well done.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I play dis 24/7 it's so addicting I wish redstone was in this hope do that in a update I love REDSTONE and redstone contraptions like pistons.
B0027Z2T8C|5.0|The looney-toons style comedy and action are great. I prefer the sub-tittled version for the best audio, but the dubbed version is ok too. I think it is time to watch this again.
B005LLSZNM|4.0|Probably my favorite season.  Sometimes a bit silly.. but hooked.  Wish that the extras and deleted scenes were included online.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love it. When my eyes get tired from reading my books,  I play Bingo and pretend that I am with a Club Group of Ladies with free time playing bingo and having lots of fun!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is hands down, my second favorite bingo game for kindle.  I love the free tournament each day and the black out game is really fun.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Turn on the sound, drop the coing in, and you have your own pretend slot machine.  It has its own bit of frenzy.  Enjoyable.  Try it and I gurantee, you will find it exhilarating.  Go ahead, try it.
B009ANP4F4|4.0|This item was great and had all the requiresment that were givin  to me while I was reading in  description
B004WJV6OY|4.0|A couple of superb songs, I love this guy but Eddie's ego is out in the open on several cuts, I had to skip them.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|I read that if I only own two books on writing, they should be 'Elements of Style' and ' On Writing'\\".  Although I already owned a lot of books on writing, my collection did not include \\"On Writing\\" by Stephen King.  Now it does, so disaster averted I suppose.<br /><br />First, this is a good read. I don't recall reading any Stephen King books before. So here I am, late to the table, discovering what everyone else already knew - he is a master craftsman.<br /><br />Second, his guidance is simple to follow and delivered with conviction.  Along the lines of, \\"this is what I do, this is why I do it, here is an example of me doing this, here is an example of someone who didn't do this\\".<br /><br />So I could agree with that first idea that if I could only have two books on writing, one of them could be this one.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I never really got involved in the story.  The author's first two books were, I think, really great.  I cou ld not identify with any of the characters.  The plot seemed to jump from one place to another too frequently.  Sorry.  Perhaps his next novel will leave a better taste in my mouth.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Spoiler alert - two of the BEST characters are killed off!  Why did that have to happen?? I truly cried at their departures. Have Kleenex handy!  reminds me of how much I enjoyed &#34;Brideshead Revisited&#34;
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Nice alarm/clock for a tablet.  Needed it when  my phone  was charging elsewhere and it filled the bill.  Works better than I expected it to.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was a very good book.  It had several unexpected twists and the ending was very different.  I highly recommend it.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|Classic Vedder on this one, be warned the movie will give you nightmares.<br />The young stupidity made me just cringe.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This installed very easily and gives great information. I like the way the information is presented and the multiple screens.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|A nice and easy read that will make you cry at times.  The author tied all the characters together wonderfully.
0375869026|5.0|This message speaks volumes for young and old.  Don't let this young adult reader put you off from reading!  Fantastically written.  I read it and shared it with my 10 year old.  It's like we had our own in house book club!
B006FTC6ZC|4.0|Goes in a direction you might not expect.  The characters are great and you may never love actors Taylor Labine and Alan Tudyk more.  :)
B005CMSDKA|4.0|The story focuses on a genetically altered young girl who has grown up in an isolated environmet but is now ready to come out of hiding. Carefully trained by her father figure to function as an assasin she moves into society to face some serious challenges as the government tries to kill both her and her \\"dad.\\"<br /><br />The story moves around a lot, starting in the cold woods of the far north then moving to the desert and finally to some urban settings. This is one of those movies that doesnt' have a clear-cut ending but just sort of stops.<br /><br />What was interesting to me about the movie is how well it works, as strange as it is. The music, the settings, the characters and the scenery all work with a surprising harmony to produce a film which creats a strong atmosphere and some sympathy and concern for Hanna and those who have befriended her.<br /><br />This is a movie for the action movie fan and is sure to turn off the typical family film enthusiast. I would think it more suitable for adults and older teen-agers.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I was already eating low-carb and decided to check this book out. It convinced me that I needed to cut out wheat products, not just cut back on them. A few months later I realized that the bursitis in my shoulders that drove me crazy at night was gone. Try to convince my house than this, but it took a trip to the hospital for an angiogram to even get him to read the book. He had read about a fifth of the book when he announced he was done wheat. Now his bad shoulder is not bothering him. Everyone should read this book!
B00B5QGPZC|5.0|Wide variety of musical selections, consumate performer and extraordinary musician. Comedic interludes contribute to pleasing performance.<br />DVD WAS PERFECT.<br />Would buy this at almost any price
B00425S1H8|4.0|The price for this cord was very good, a fraction of what a similar cord would cost at an electronics store.  I was frustrated to see the two screws on the sides of the plug were in the way, but found them easy enough to remove using a pliers.  The end no longer looks good, but works just fine.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Very nice design.  I haven't tried to maximize its ability to charge two different items.  I just plug my iPhone into the Apple port and anything else into the other port.  Easy to use.
B00BTWCK6U|2.0|I've always been a fan of Stryper, so I was really looking forward to this video.  I've enjoyed the fact that they've stayed in it and kept producing new albums.  Michael's voice continues to be awesome!  This video showcases the band's talent, no argument there.  Every member of  the band exhibits amazing skill!  Robert's drumming is awesome!  Tim's bass rocks!  Oz is always shredding perfection.  I truly love these guys.... BUT... (if I may be bluntly honest) the bummer for me about this video was that they didn't appear to be having much fun.  It shows on their faces.  Even the crowd seems to know it and it was disappointing to watch Michael stopping the band to lecture the crowd on getting involved.  I'm glad I only rented this DVD... I will not be adding it to my collection, sadly.  All due respect to the guys because I love them and they remain one of my favorite bands (not to mention my brothers in Jesus), but I was just sad to watch this performance because they didn't seem to be having much fun.<br /><br />I've played in a couple of bands myself and one thing I've learned is that EVEN IF YOU SUCK, the crowd will have a blast and think you're awesome if you're actually smiling and having fun playing.  I never would have believed that before seeing it, because I'm so picky about music...  But it's really true.  People are not just connecting with the music.  It's the whole experience and these guys need to totally let their lights shine because it's the best part about the music!  Maybe it wasn't a great day for them...  Maybe there were other things going on that just caused this impression to come across... and maybe it's just me... But I noticed it nevertheless and so this won't be my favorite Stryper video, unfortunately.<br /><br />This video was a massive contrast to their earlier production &#34;Greatest Hits Live In Puerto Rico&#34;, which was pure awesome and the guys totally appeared to be having lots of fun in that video... and Michael's singing performance in that video was absolutely tops as well!!!!  Way awesome!!!!<br /><br />This one wasn't awful though...  There are some fantastic performances!  The music is awesome!  That's my only complaint; that it doesn't feel as fun as it should have.  Call me crazy.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Another reviewer said the China doll was the most interesting, empathetic character in this movie. I thought he was joking. Turns out, the reviewer was dead on. The China doll character is well animated and emotes more than the other characters combined.<br /><br />The acting of the other characters brings this movie down. Unfortunately, I think a lot of the roles were miscast. For the Oz character, the movie really needed somebody with a lot of energy and confidence like Jack Black or Johnny Depp. James Franco just comes across as awkward. The witches aren't fully convincing, often coming across as bickering teens rather than larger-than-life characters.<br /><br />This is also yet another movie where the CGI tends to hurt rather than harm the film. On its own, the CGI looks beautiful, but whenever a human is in the frame it only reinforces how fake it all seems. I could never actually believe that the humans were actually in Oz as opposed to in front of a green screen.<br /><br />This isn't a horrible movie. The depiction of Oz is more wonderful than what we got with the original movie, so CGI worked in that respect. However, the problems with the acting and merging live actors with CGI makes me think any return to Oz should be a fully animated film rather than live action. Overall, 3.5 stars.

0321934318|5.0|great book for quick reference.. keep it next to my computer just in case i need to know something.  explains pretty good few times had little trouble getting what was said till i sit back and thought about it.  but all adobe is kind of hard.  but book is worth it if u just got the program r if u just want it just in case.  for me it's just in case.
140006922X|1.0|I would sooner read a book by a Muslim about \\"great BBQ pork in the South\\" than read a book by a Muslim on Christ Jesus, the God-Man.  I would sooner read a book by a Hindu on \\"Great Recipes for Hamburger,\\" than I would this book.  If you are looking at a skewed view from the outset, than this is your book.
B004YW4L5K|2.0|Even though I managed to wrap my head around the fact that the characters were supposed to be gods or legends that immigrants have brought to America through their stories, etc, I still could not finish the book.  The characters did not seem to resemble their respective gods at all - either in name, dress, or character.  The story bounced around so much that I could barely follow it at times.  And the purpose for the &#34;big war&#34; that was coming, as well as who was fighting who, was so bizzarre as that I finally gave up reading it.  I think the author was trying to make the story a metaphor for how technology is taking over society and replacing people's need for spirituality, but he was unsuccessful in getting the point across in a fashion that was pleasant to read.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I GUESS I AM A FAN OF POST APOCALYPTIC SHOWS; LIKE &#34;THE WALKIING DEAD&#34;, THIS SHOW HAS WONDERFUL CHARACTERS....BOTH ARE EXCELLENT CHARACTER DRIVEN SHOWS.  WHETHER IT'S ALIENS OR ZOMBIES THAT ARE TRYING TO DESTROY OUR PLANET OR OUR WAY OF LIFE....I BELIEVE YOU WILL ALWAYS FIND GOOD PEOPLE WHO WILL ABSOLUTELY FIGHT TO KEEP THEIR HUMANITY AND DO THE RIGHT THING.  THERE ARE VERY GOOD WRITERS FOR THIS SHOW AND THEY GET IT &#34;RIGHT&#34; MOST OF THE TIME. NOAH WYLIE AND THE YOUNG MEN WHO PLAY HIS SONS ON THE SHOW PORTARY ARE VERY STRONG, LOVING, SUPPORTIVE FAMILY.
B00EH6SK78|5.0|I love devildriver because they can play their own way always, ans they make my head bang bang bang bang.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|A little wordy, but an entertaining read. Interesting twists and turns. A bit hard to relate to, as I do not have children and find some of the parental points of view a bit hard to believe would be as consuming as portrayed. A good book for a rainy weekend.
B00B22ASUM|4.0|I liked the first half of the book best, when James told the story of how he found Bob, worked to get him healthy, and discovered that he's a brilliant busker's mate.  The second half was more about James; still a good read, but not enough about Bob.
1851775722|5.0|I cannot believe such clothes were able to be produced, and by hand not less. The author did a better job on this book, than on her previous one ( 17-18 Century Fashion in Detail) by including photos of the entire garments. Drool, drool , drool ... This is pure eye candy.
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|MLP does not fail to impress a good moral within an entertaining show.  While this particular movie has caused all kinds of drama claiming that MLP is over sexualized I for one do not agree.  I am very choosey about what my children watch and I do not find this to be a bad influence.  Yes, I agree that the skirts on the girls are ridiculous.  However, these are ponies (how are ponies sexual?).  Even when they are in the human form I do not think that they are anywhere near the sexualized degree of many other &#34;fashion doll turned movies.&#34;  If you want your kids to enjoy some pop culture and learn lessons in being honest, caring, brave, and true to themselves despite peer pressure (and I could definitely go on) than MLP is a great choice.
0143124544|5.0|The characters just were so believabe.  They were opposites in life, but came together so well.  The story made me cry at the end.<br />Don't miss this book - would make a great movie.
B001NLL93W|5.0|the title pretty much sums it up. I had so much fun with this book- i couldn't put it down!!
1469259192|5.0|Lee Child  is a master of suspense. Worth a read if you like a good story. I was hooked from the start.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Many times I am disappointed in a sequel book, but not this time. The characters continued to grow and change, the action intensified, and all of it served to help me become more attached to the story! Fabulous!
B00D7JGL36|5.0|It's one of those CD's you can play / loop endlessly! Bought it for both sets of our parents as well. They too love it!
0679805273|5.0|I got this idea on Pinterest.  Bought the book for my 8 year old granddaughter.  Each year I have her teacher write a little note to her.  When she graduates 8th grade she will receive this book as a present.
034580404X|5.0|This is my guilty pleasure.  I really enjoyed the books.  There are some cheesy parts, but overall, this is a great story.

B00EY8BRGU|4.0|This movie was entertaining and fast paced.  Even with the special effects the actors were quite skilled to make it real. ALWAYS enjoy Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book was a joy to come across! The characters were well developed and the story was fascinating. I was impressed with the author's writing and the story she wanted to share! Wonderful read!

B006BAEQB2|5.0|Love all of her books, this one is right up there with the best.  Seeing history from a different character's perspective is so interesting as this book is the opposite viewpoint of The White Queen.  Highly recommend.
B000E5N6LG|4.0|There is an awful lot of film here. I've watched westerns since I was a kid, so there is a lot of reference material  in my head.  The time sequencing is good after Wyatt leaves jail and heads west. The charcters are good as well as the action parts. Dennis Quaid as doc holiday is real difficult for me to get a handle on. It seems like any discussion of this movie always generates a &#34;Quaid vs. Kilmer&#34; argument. Who was better? Val Kilmer, of course plays Holiday in &#34;tombstone&#34;. The bad guys in this movie are not overplayed. The Earp brothers work pretty well together. Wyatt's actress girlfriend is well done. Alll in all, a pretty easy flick to watch.
B004J2TPSI|1.0|It stopped working after a month or so of use. Completely dead now.<br />In the beginning while it worked, battery wouldn't last more than 4 or 5 hours.
9626344059|5.0|Although, at first, I thought this was going to be over my head, I found that it was an exceptionally well written fantasy, albeit, probably one of the strangest I have ever read. The reader was nothing short of superb, handling the individual voices of the characters so well that I was always immediately aware of who was being portrayed, even before they were identified. There were really three parallel stories that occupied the pages. One concerned Kafka, another Miss Saiki and a third, Nakata. In the end, each of the stories will unite and connect, in some way, and the mysteries that unfolded will be solved. Each character, major and minor, was really fully explored, and the reader, while finding them to be a bit of a stretch of the imagination, will be able to see them in their mind's eye as real because of the skill of this writer.<br />Kafka, a fifteen year old junior high school student runs away from home on his fifteenth birthday. His mother and sister disappeared when he was four years old and all traces of them have been removed from the house. He begins his journey in order to escape his father's prophecy that he will, like Oedipus, murder his father and sleep with his mother and sister. He speaks with his (imaginary?) friend Crow, who appears when he needs him, to offer advice and is almost an alter ego. In his travels he is helped by many people who \\"march to a different drummer\\" and accept his unusual circumstances as they aid him in his efforts.<br />Nakata, lives on the public dole because he is dull-witted as a result of a strange illness contracted during WWII. However, he has a special gift. He can rescue missing cats because he has the special ability to speak the language of cats. When he becomes an unwilling accomplice to a violent act, he runs away and discovers he has additional magical powers which he accepts humbly, and seemingly, is unaware of their significance. He has no idea where he is going, but he just keeps traveling west because he understands that he will know where he is when he gets there. He, too, finds people very willing to help him in his quest, people who thank him for his positive effect on their lives, which makes him very happy. Magic is definitely afoot with spirits, talking cats, and mackerel, falling from the sky.<br />Miss Saeki was a young teacher, very much in love with her childhood friend. They are engaged. He is a soldier during WWII. During this same time, she takes her class on a trip to pick mushrooms in the forest when an unusual event takes place. This event prompts a serious investigation for which she gives testimony. The records of this event are sealed until 1986. When her sweetheart is murdered, during the war, due to a tragic error, she is distraught. She runs away and takes with her, her own secrets about the events that surrounded that strange day with her class in the forest.<br />Unbeknownst to each other, in some way, the characters are all connected and will all wind up in the town where Miss Saeki is now living. She is in charge of the special library housed in the home of her former fianc&eacute;. Each of these characters had been abandoned by life in some way and was searching for something, but they weren't really sure of exactly what that something was. They seemed to just know they had to search. So many peculiar incidents will occur during their quest, that the reader's imagination will be stretched to its limits. This talented author is unbelievably creative and will tie up all the loose ends harmoniously, as he leads the reader through the labyrinth of his story.<br />When the book ends, the reader will be compelled to simply sit for a few moments and think about what has been read. There were so many ideas presented, and they will converge upon the reader's thoughts. Common themes, which may not be noticed until the very end, will come to light, like the common thread of blood that occurred in each character's life, or the secret identity of oneor another, or the significance of the magical characters with their strange names, or what the spirits really represented, or even why they were compelled to escape from their lives in search of something they couldn't define? Is that something still hidden in the end, or is it the obvious answer that is revealed? That is the question which will haunt the reader.other, or the significance of the magical characters with their strange names, or what the spirits really represented, or even why they were compelled to escape from their lives in search of something they couldn't define?

B007HACDLK|4.0|More mayhem visited on the enemies of Americans by Mitch Rapp.  As all of Flynn's novels, a fun read and interesting from front to back, but not as original or novel as some of his earlier books.  Much better than Jack Reacher, even.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Keeps you wondering and can be challenging at times. Sometimes a few things are hair to make out but other than that I like the game. I'm just happy it isn't super easy every time. I like it.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Great app, for sharing recipes, gardening, tips &amp; information. It's awesome to be able to have everything in one app on Pinterest. I am an organized person, have run out of boards already. No compliants. Love it.
6304711905|4.0|I don't want to go on long about this movie. Suffice it to say it moves along well and the characters are pretty well cast. No question Val Kilmer steals the show as Doc Holiday. For me however, some of the key action scenes seem a little too well rehearsed like the river shootout with Powers Booth and the cowboys. The O.K. corral shootout is very good. Plenty of reckoning here. I don't like Wyatt's actress love interest. She's just too goofy and flitty. In the end,  &#34;Tombstone and &#34;wyatt Earp&#34; can be analyzed, discussed, and compared for hours, with no end in sight.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I gave this the 5 stars, just as I did for Season 1.  The rest is from my review of how great I thought the show was!<br /><br />&#34;I chose this rating because of how much I think about the show when I'm not watching. That is how I judge my TV. It is right up there with West Wing, LOST, and FRINGE for me.<br /><br />I love how smart the writing is, while retaining moments of humor. You care deeply for the characters. While some shows are pretty intense, they tend to space them out well with story development episodes.<br /><br />I would recommend to people who like smart and funny shows involving law or politics. For example, I love West Wing, and I dove all into this show after the pilot! Watching it for free without commercials on Amazon is a huge bonus.&#34;
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Solving the mystery of the missing girls and a detective was not easy but the tools I collected were useful. Eye popping graphics and tough puzzles.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Fascinating look inside the mind, inside North Korea...  Hard to read sometimes, uncomfortable to know about, but also so well-written one keeps reading anyway.  Really glad I did.  Bravo!
B00ENTDDGW|4.0|like this game, very challenging It's like the old air hockey games but you can take it with you.Very nice
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|I love all the actors in this film. I wish to see more films with all of them in it. Excellent entertainment!
B002VPE1AW|3.0|what happen with you guys?? you delivery takes much longer now!! very disappointing...makes me want to look elsewhere for other options...
B00A7CF1QY|5.0|Nicely woven into the previous Bourne movie, but with a broader view and different characters of the larger world of Jason Bourne. And, a puppet master portrayed by Edward Norton.  Hats off to the Gilroy brothers for a tight screen play... And, also to Tony Gilroy's story and directing.  The production quality is great, as is the stunts and action sequences, as it should be in an action movie.  Some will say its the same story, well, so what?  I like the story...they can continue telling it, especially if they get actors such as these to play the characters:  Jeremy Renner, Oscar Issac, Rachel Weisz, and Edward Norton.  The interaction between Jeremy's Aaron Cross character and Oscar's character is dynamic and very revealing... A good bit of acting. The 'in the car' scene between Jeremy's character and Rachel's character is great as well.  The desperate humanity in the characters is revealed... Jeremy shines again with the hospital sequences which tell you so much about where Aaron Cross began....and, then you have the 'running' scenes which provide the action but also move the story along.  That is the mix that makes for a good movie.  And, it really helps that Jeremy Renner did a lot of his own stunts.  I want to see a sequel to find out what happens to these characters.
B009AY04A8|4.0|Love the way the game tests me.  You can also skip through the dialog which is a plus. The pictures are realistic and you really have to look to find the items.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|I thought it was a good book. A little dramatic at times. My friend thinks its to dramatic. Overall though it is a very excellent written book cant wait to read reached
B00005B36H|5.0|This band has yet to put out a bad disc. everything they have done has been a masterpiece and is worthy of having in your collection.
6304806434|3.0|A very tongue in cheek take on films. Not to be taken too seriously. A lot of action, too. I like Nic Cage.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|An easy read giving a fascinating historical perspective to the life and times of Jesus.  May not be the narrative given in Sunday school, but well worth the read.
B0091WKXKU|4.0|Jeremy Renner shines in this one... Sorry Ben.  Jeremy Renner plays those somewhat likeable, twisted characters very well.  He provides just enough charm and humanity that you can't hate the character...another Oscar nomination for him... Best Supporting Actor.  You have a idea about the outcome of the story but it's the interactions of the characters that take you along for the ride.  A crime drama well worth the watch.
0385537689|5.0|I ordered the trilogy based on recommendations from several of my friends.  Fifty pages into Book one I almost stopped reading the book and regretted purchasing them.  However, I am so happy I read on.  I was happily surprised and thoroughly enjoyed the evolution of the characters and the development of their relationship.  I hated the series to end.  Thoroughly recommend each book in the series.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Love the game...hate the ads.  You can skip them but there are a LOT of ads to skip.  Otherwise plays well
B00D7JGL36|4.0|I always like Vince Gill's music and this one is no different. Great tribute to Buck Owens.  Enjoy the older style country music!
B0057R5XRG|5.0|These movies are great! The first movie is the best, much more thought went into the story. There very entertaining. Especially if you like dinosaurs.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I don't understand how this book got so many bad reviews. this book was my favorite so far out of the whole series I ended up borrowing this book from a friend instead of purchasing it for my kindle because I saw all the negative reviews I am so glad I decided to read it. this book had so many mind-blowing discoveries about all the characters I have to say if you did like Book 1&2 you will definitely like this book I say don't go by the negative reviews and read it you won't be disappointed this book left me wanting more and I'm excited to read the fourth book once it comes out
B00942XWWI|5.0|I understand why it was nominated for all those oscars, including Best Actor for Jeremy Renner.  It's not what you think when you think of military movies.  It's a story about a lifestyle and individual struggles with the realities of war and &#34;military actions&#34;.  Some individuals thrive during war (they find a purpose in it), others do not.  This is more a story of survival than anything else.  I'm not a fan of military movies in general, but I found that this one has so much humanity and a story telling purpose...it also has Jeremy Renner and I'm a fan of his work...  If this movie portrays the realities of what bomb disposal experts experience, I am even more in awe of what they do.  Watch it, you'll see.
B00B9B4IYI|5.0|By going over digital the sound is much better than others going over analog.  If you have a Yamaha Surround though the best sound from remote device is over the network, but the android app still doesn't play all files like my M4A's I make with Winamp, so I use this for playing everything...and the WiFi app for annoying the wife by changing settings in another room.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I hear the TV series is popular but I don't have HBO and the books are fabulous.  I think I would rather read the book than watch a movie anyway.  The plot is very complicated and character development is awesome.  I'll probably read it more than once.
B00415EYJ8|5.0|If your a Cure fan, and if your not you should be, this is an absolute must have collection. Check the number of songs. SEVENTY! Its worth it.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I still love it after watching the full series for the 2nd TIME. It's amazing what you did NOT notice the 1st time. Great way to view some history, allowing some creative expression and talk about Creative.....the jewels, wardrobes, fashion and textiles stand on their own.  Acting is superb! I thought I would see the &#34;king&#34; in a lot more major productions after this one. This time around the computer generated backdrops and scenery were more noticeable. The best way to watch these series is together, at once......you lose that momentum, the great build-up when you have to wait each week and then a year to complete the seasons.Amazon Prime offers a lot of these complete series and now we have moved our viewing from the KindleFire to streaming on our TV!  Life is good!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I usually read sci-fi for action and adventure but this was so much more! I've never felt so much for a character before. Wonderful read!
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|Didn't get to see the movie because of downloading problems. Amazon charged me anyway. Won't be ordering movies again from Amazon. Especially from my blueray player.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Like many YA selections, The Fault in Our Stars has an enduring message that transcends adolescence.  It reminds readers not only of the fragility of life, but also of our innate potential to change the lives and hearts of those around us.<br />-F. Nelson

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I couldn't put this down for three quarters of my reading, and then I did for less than 24 hours because I didn't want my reading to end. I see why my students fell in love with this novel. It's a beautiful, idealistic tragedy. A story you won't soon forget. Excellent read for teens, but even as an adult, I was moved.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|ezPDF Reader has a lot very useful tools. I like the text reflow(new) options, but it has a little bug-some times in random place is inserted space. I use 200% zoom.
0345803485|1.0|I am so mad I bought this book and even madder that I read the whole thing.  This is really a case of the Emperer's new clothes.  I was duped into reading it because it was on the New York Times list forever.  I figure-it has to be great-right? Wrong.  I hope the people who create the best seller list have learned something by these books.  There needs to be disclosure to those who are not interested in reading books that are soft porn that that is what the book is about.  There is a reputation that should be protected and a whole bunch of people bough a book because it was on the top seller list without knowing it was all about turning on women with electronic devices (and apparently there are a ton of them). Do not read this book if you are looking for a real story and since this has exploded the soft porn industry and tons of these types of books are being churned out be very careful about making your selection.  I keep downloading books that are this type right now and it is really frustrating.  I am sure that a book like this will do fine without duping the public into thinking it is really something special.  There is a reason the book sold a lot of copies but the reason is not because it is a fantastic story.  It has its purpose, but should never have been represented on the NYT bestsellers.  I am sure there had to be some YuK moments with the staff of NYT.  Someone surely had to realize that lots of people were purchasing that book who had no business buying it.  It has mad me wary, thats for sure. I did buy this on Amazon.  Now in fairness to the book, it is a soft porn and if that is what you are looking for then by all means, I am sure you will be very excited with the sexual escapades over and over and over again.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Love this show. The characters are interesting and the dialogue is fantastic! This isn't like any other lawyer-based drama or comedy on television! This one's a can't miss!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|What an incredible book. This reads like a fiction novel, incredibly well paced, well plotted, and filled with heroic actions and combat insight.  The fact that is all true is even more stunning. And then the epitome of gallantry that centers this book takes it over the top.  Several of the best war accounts can move a reader to tears, this one actually evokes tears of gladness.  A stunning achievement, both in the research and the narration, but even more amazing are the pilots at the heart of this book.  Franz Stiegler and the writing in this book both deserve all the honors that can be bestowed.
B00CW7KK9K|2.0|I own a Fitbit One and used it for some time prior to getting the Pulse. I wore them both at the same time for about a week prior to switching to the Pulse exclusively. The Pulse's software seems to be better and the screen is better, but the Fitbit is smaller and feels more durable. In the end though the size issue will come back to haunt you. The Pulse's activity and calories calculations are much more conservative than the Fitbit. The Pulse seems to only calculate actual calories burned through your activity on a given day, while the Fitbit seems to make an assumption about your RMR (resting metabolic rate) and adds that in to your daily calories burned from activity. This was evident in the mornings when I first got up. The Fitbit would tell me that I had already burned a few hundred calories while the Pulse would show almost no calorie burned. Although the Fitbit is correct that I had burned calories while sleeping, without knowing my personal RMR, the Fitbit's resting calorie burn calculation is just a guess. Additionally the Fitbit would often show that I had covered a lot of distance every morning before I had even gotten out of bed. I do live in a house that was built in the 1850's but it does have indoor plumbing and it is not the quarter to a half mile to the bathroom that Fitbit would suggest. The Pulse on the other hand shows only a more realistic few steps to my bathroom. The pulse also does give more complete and useful sleep information, although the Fitbit provides an alarm that the Pules does not. HOWEVER the biggest problem with the Pulse is the silicone clip that it fits into so that you can attach it to your clothing. The pulse is larger than a Fitbit but the clip is much larger than it has to be. The clip is made of silicone with a metal frame. The part of the clip that goes on the outside of your clothes is huge compared to the Fitbit and includes unnecessary silicone that adds bulk and helps the clip to catch on things. I am a male and if I use the clip to attach the pulse to pants that have a vertical pocket the clip is in a horizontal position and it constantly catches on things. The horizontal pockets of jeans are not as large a problem. During the two or so months that I had my Pulse I lost it constantly, usually in my car. The sides of my car's seats were especially good at knocking it off. I did let Withings know about the problem and perhaps they will change the design someday. But I knew that it was only a matter of time before I lost it for good. That has now happened and I can only suggest that until Withings fixes the problem that the Fitbit is a better bet. It does not really matter if the Pulse is better if it is easily lost.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Love David Tennant but this show has the best writing and best cast ever! Never watched a program 4 or 5 times before. Don't miss a single line of dialogue it may be key to the mystery.
B006JRY2QG|5.0|Great Story line. Just when you think it's all working out, there's and unexpected turn..<br />Love this show!!  Can't wait for the next season!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I like being able to use this Weather app to see what the weather will be like where I live & plenty more ;)
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love this game.  Just wish some of the items weren't so hard to get.  Have recommended to many others who love it too.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|My wife and I love this movie!  The acticing is great!  I think they cover the Indian culture very well.  I work now with many India Indians and it seems very true to form.  So, expect to laugh, maybe cry, and be entertained!  How can you go wrong with Judi Dench and Maggie Smith in the same film!
B008Z9L94O|5.0|Great quality of a product! Sounds amazing! I am very satisfied! This product consists of 4 vinyls, and extra cute materials that I enjoyed. I would recommend it!
B00ESY827C|5.0|Awesome movie! Love Leo. Has to bet favorite actor of all time. This movie is the icing on the cake for my love for him. So hopeful &#60;3
B002PYW26O|2.0|Didnt care for the casting, found it boring.  Watched with my kids age 12 and they didn't like it either.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Very good book. Kept me interested in what's going to happen next. A little confusing as to how everyone fit together. Rhonda
1475144687|4.0|This book is NOT what I expected. No wonder he had so many followers. Too bad he went nuts thought he could bite more than he could chew.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|We already knew we loved the whole Harry Potter series and owned many of the movies.  But some of our movies were on VHS tapes, some had been formatted for TV.  These are all letter box (full size) movies.  Great quality and they were at a great price!
1439196834|5.0|I bought this one for a gift. My friend loved it, and it was fun for me to go over the book, too.
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|Book was a great continuation of the story.  Paolini's writing seems to mature with each book.  Will definitely want to pick up the last book after reading this one.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Good story, engaging characters. If you are looking for worthwhile drama and some light humor this is the series. I love the tension in the relationships and the drama of the times. Progress is surging forward and the reluctance of the old to make way for the young! Good stuff!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this site because you can get some great ideas from here, along with amazing projects to do for any occasion.
B00101ZOTA|5.0|Probably the 3rd time I've watched it from beginning to end -- and it gets better with each repetition!  Each time, I pick up some new clue or nuance that -- now that I know how it ends -- I could have caught in a previous viewing that would have made the ending something less than a total shock.  A very underrated movie compared to other 'con-jobs' like The Sting.
B005I0DV4Y|5.0|We love this movie!  It has a great story and a very good message.  The acting is great!  Great for the whole family.
B001GMQE7E|5.0|The CD contains relaxing, beautiful, and peaceful music that immediately calms the soul and puts one's mind at ease!  Great CD!
B004FRX0MY|4.0|I  don't use it to its full potential but I  prefer the  interface to the  music player native to my phone. I  do sometimes get lost and have to back out of individual screens but overall decent app.
B005544TRQ|5.0|The first show got me hooked! It's fast and funny and has a lot of sitting on the edge of your set drama.
B006OE7XM4|4.0|Incredibly soulful jazz singer, his lyricism and turn of phrase has the first 3 songs echoing in my head all day long.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|As with his two previous books, Mr. Hosseni draws you immediately into the lives of his characters.  His use of language is superb and his use of placing each chapter in the &#34;voice&#34; of his many characters helps to make this sweeping novel a real page turner.<br />A must read for all those like myself who are looking for a great novel.
B000JLSLZQ|4.0|When I was looking at purchasing this film I was surprised to find I didn't already have it in my collection on DVD. That clinched it and I knew I was going to have to pick it up. This movie is not only quite an enjoyable viewing experience but full of great soundscapes I've found quite useful for testing sound systems.
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|I didn't love it or hate it but it seemed like there was a lot of hype behind this one.
B00E0MCYPS|5.0|Speaking from hours of experience on the best rally simulator, Colin McRae Rally on the PC, and actual amateur rally racing myself, You will not get a better really racing experience on the Android than Pocket Rally. It's hard to believe that a phone can produce this level of complex physics models.  The math equations that allow you to experience this would break most people's brains in half.  This game is hard to master and that is the point, you're actually going toto have to work at it and become better and better as you continually learn the subtle nuances of rally racing.  Find a line through the curve and execute.  The best advice I have is like in real racing do not over compensate.  Thank You Amazon for providing such a great game I never would have seen otherwise. And thank you to the developers who I know must have a passion for rally racing for providing a game that is absolutely the best rally racing experience on the phone.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is a fun game to play and it can help you focus more when it comes to real life
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A nice little game for anyone bored with a bunch of ticked off birds.  Careful though, you can stiill waste the whole day playing it.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|The Kindle Fire HD 7 case is outstanding. It is very stylish and professional looking. It is durable and efficient in containing my kindle without allowing dust to get into the ports. It is lightweight and easy to carry along with other items. The purple is an amazing color, love it! Highly recommend this and other Marware products.
B004JMSIRC|4.0|This movie was good in it's own right, but I have to wonder if they creators knew what they were starting with it. From here it's been nothing but up for Marvel in their movies in terms of scope and vision. This one is a great movie to have around to allow you to revisit the start of the franchise for it's great one-liners and Jeff Bridges playing a wonderfully evil bad guy.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I've put off writing this review for long enough!<br /><br />I honestly have NO complaints with the price, product, or Anker customer support.<br />Everything just fits!<br /><br />To make a note here first about why you can't lose with this product:<br /><br />29 days into owning this product, I had a spill at the computer with my son one day; in a panic, i pushed everything that had gotten wet off the desk, in a hurry.<br />The cord on the front of the mouse snagged due to excess force and ripped out... Total kill-joy, but an error on my part, nonetheless.<br />I figured, let's look into the warranty....  saw something about 18 months, figured i'd contact Anker support.  It was a Sunday on a holiday weekend when i got my reply, literally 5 hours after i had submit my inquiry.  The spokesperson stated that they would replace the product as per their 18 month warranty-- WIN WIN!<br />I sent the broken one in that Monday, got the new one (from California to Maryland) 2 days later.<br />I can honestly say this customer support blew me away with how well and efficiently they took care of me--and for something that was my own error.  Truly impressed!<br /><br />A brief overview of Specs.:<br /><br />Hardware:<br />:Adjustable weight for personalized resistance when moving the mouse.<br />:Shift, Ctrl, & Alt buttons placed conveniently near the thumb for enhanced gaming performance.<br />:4 buttons (scroll wheel included) placed on the top for even further enhancements in performance<br /><br />Software:<br />:Custom sensitivity & button profiles for preference swapping on the fly!<br />:(for aesthetic junkies like me) Excellent customization control for the LED on the mouse; any color, any pulse rate.<br /><br />Don't hesitate to buy one for yourself, with an 18 month &#34;no-questions-asked&#34; kind of warranty, you really have nothing to lose here!<br /><br />Overall:<br />+Customization<br />+Superior Gaming Performance<br />+18 month Warranty
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|You're browsing through book reviews, wondering if this book is a good read.  I know...I do it all the time, and lately I'm finding myself lost and overwhelmed by a sea of new authors, ultimately settling for a book I'm disappointed with.  What a relief to FINALLY find an intriguing, page-turner such as this! It's the perfect balance of drama, romance, and suspense, with characters you can relate to and fall in love with.  This is my first Liane Moriarty book and certainly will not be the last!
B00E0MCYPS|3.0|The raising app is not the best for a kindle fire, because the divice is too big and you onley controol it by tilt!!!
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|This is a very addictive game. It's so simple but you get hooked. My daughter who is 6 lives this game as well.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved each season of Downton Abbey. I didn't watch the series when it first started so watching each episode of season 1-3 got me up to speed.<br />I love the story line of the family during times of war, bad investments & into a more modern time. The clothing is exceptional as well as the picturesque scenery and castles. The automobiles are quite elegant & proper for the times.. I've grown to love the downstairs help as much as the kind & caring upstairs rich family. Love how the family has a English point of view that sometimes fights the American side that is shown in the Abbey's mother as well as her mother. Maggie Smith is quite a dame to watch. Her expressions & pauses just add to the very prim & proper English style. With the addition of Shirley Maclaine as the American material grandmother, I can laugh at &#34;our&#34; differences to that of the Abbey's inhabitants, whether downstairs help or upstairs upper class.<br />I can't wait until season 4 commences in January! But I'm sad to see the two very painful deaths of the sister and husband of the eldest daughter. I'm still waiting for the 2nd daughter to finally find some degree of happiness in a marriage or maybe even a love affair!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I like the fact that it's avialable offline too--perfectly offered via Kindle Fire/other devices t and has readable print sizing!
0345446798|5.0|We just rescued a beautiful Aussie and because he is so intelligent I had no idea, what to do with all of his energy other than exercise. I have had dogs all of my life, but this is the first book that helped me understand my dogs.  She uses positive reinforcement, just like I do with children, and it works every time.  In myopinion, humans are the ones who require patience to learn what is truly effective.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Easy to use and loud enough to hear. The last comment for me is important because I have a hearing problem.(old)
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I've read several near death experience books, and expected more from this author since he is a surgeon.  The good news is that the experienced proved to him that there is life after death, unlike the medical profession who thinks those experiences are brain / dream reactions to stress.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Didn't realize this would show up here. Anyways, great app. I use it all the time to download YouTube videos and watch them later on networks that aren't great.
0812992784|3.0|What a brilliant premise for a work of fiction!  Have a protagonist write a score-settling memoir after having written a novel that gravely offended fundamentalists in a semi-literate, terrorist breeding-ground country.  (Man, don't you hate when that happens?)  The protagonist valiantly fights the good fight for a righteous cause - in this case, freedom of speech; heck, his right to life - but as the layers are pulled back it's revealed that the protagonist is so vain and clueless and tone-deaf that whole swaths of people who hate censorship as much as he does are turned off.  This incenses him almost as much as the religious fanatics' threats.  Publishers who chose not to risk their, their family's, or their employees' lives on publishing the (frigging) PAPERBACK edition of the book are never forgiven.  Having the Her Majesty's Government giving him round the clock protection is a grave insult.  (It was shameful how these [professional, yet probably culturally illiterate, working-class] people talked to him!)  No one, he moans, understands LIT-tra-chure, no one realizes the super-duper ultra-important role of the writer.  (If occupations could be granted a Pass on douchiness I'd just as soon give it to brain surgeons or pastry chefs, but that's just me.)  It's exhausting but fascinating to read, like would be a novel about a Dalai Lama who in private life is an  insufferable diva.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Love the show.  It is too bad it is not on any more, I would like to see this continue.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Not as good as one but still a good rea. Why do i have to say mire? I'm reading it again in anticipation of the movie coming out.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Although I like to keep abreast of current and future weather conditions I don't want the app running 24/7 in the background which is what it did when I activated it for a &#34;look-see&#34;.  I couldn't figure out (new to smartphones) how to shut it off but I did figure out how to uninstall it.  I'll just use the weather app pre-installed on my Galaxy 3s instead.
0307592731|5.0|If only to learn about hiking, this was a great book!  Being non-fiction this book grabbed you.  It made one think they can do more than they think they can if they keep on going.  Well written and engaging.
B006E4QCXU|3.0|Yea this app was really interesting and fun. But it has no purpose and lost its novelty fast. Great for kids I suppose.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|Good read but thought the book fizzled a bit at the end. The plot was a bit complicated with many players.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Every year we look forward to watching this with our children during the holidays.  Now it is available in 3D, so we had to buy it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My 5 year old granddaughter and I had a blast trying to figure out the clues. The higher up you get, the tougher the clues become but we made it, with a little help from Grandma :-)
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I rely upon Google on my PC for all my informational searches and love having the app on my phone for quick reference as well.  Very satisfied with this app.
B000FBFM9S|3.0|Perhaps I'm too  shallow to have gotten some of the innuendo's but this is a very detailed book about some strange characters who muddle through life with insecurities.  The author does try to bring to light the sameness in the difference in the characters, but it was overdevloped in some parts, and underdeveloped in others.  I actually thought about not reading to the end.  But I did.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Kindle is staying charged lot better. I use the Kindle a lot but believe it is staying charged up better.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Very stimulating, great series! It's impossible to predict what's going to happen next! Reminds me of the 80s series, L.A. Law, but even better! I'm officially hooked!
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Diamond Dash is a fun game. I like to play on my own not with the community<br /><br />I don't like to have to buy new lives all the time
B00821OX98|5.0|Engaging show - with a real message in it - the one thing I did not like is that after the second season - Amazon looks to charge for viewing.
B000002UTT|5.0|I love everything about it! I've dreamed of having this album for so long, now I have it in my hands! Can't be more thankful! Thank you!
B007EECSFA|5.0|I love how Kate Morton writes. Easy to read, but full of wonderful words that bring things to life in a different light....phrases that stayed with me. Each time I had to put the book down to &#34;live&#34; I couldn't help thinking about the story. The conclusion was a surprise that I never thought of until it was too late...it caught me off guard. You will love this book!
B00A2H9OZS|4.0|This latest sequel in the Riddick series, takes us full circle as the baddest anti-hero in the galaxy finds himself betrayed by the Necromongers and left for dead.  The first part of this film is essentially a great survival story, where Riddick returns to his more feral roots however the tenor quickly changes when he finds a way to signal for \\"rescue\\" but instead gets reminded that he's still a wanted fugitive (VERY wanted).  At this point, the movie becomes semi-horror reminiscent of the original \\"Pitch Black\\" (except much better) as he reminds everyone, including the audience, just why he's so feared.<br /><br />This is easily the best of the trilogy in my opinion and presents a darker and more violent story than \\"Chronicles\\" represented by the PG-13 back to R rating however it doesn't saturate the dialogue with gratuitous profanity as in the first film; there's also very brief nudity and again, lots of violence but these things all supplement what is essentially a fierce tale of survival and a very well made sci-fi film.<br /><br />As I was watching Riddick at one point, surrounded by enemies in the midst of a raging storm, I was reminded of a line from a poem: \\"Out of the night that covers me, black as the pit from pole to pole, I thank whatever gods may be for my unconquerable soul.  In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced nor cried aloud. Under the bludgeonings of chance my head is bloody, but unbowed.\\"  :o)
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|A lot of PHYSICAL/REAL action.  Star Trek TV shows stayed on the bridge too much .deliberating on which button to push.  I like to see them get out there and 'git busy'!!!  Its raw, much less calculated, fun and frankly realistic.  Sure, they're scientists and they're exploring BUT here's where they earn their reputations- by actions, not just mental- everything they have to offer is tested.  _THAT_ is what made this movie and the first one _FUN_ !!!  They're more than mere scientists or detectives in sandbox- they've got to step outside that sandbox and get after whatever they need to accomplish.  Super cool.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Play it all the time.  Requires thought.<br />Have played Spider Solitaire ever since I got my I Pad.<br />Now I have it on my phone.<br /><br />Would recomend to everyone
B005544V6A|5.0|An interesting series with not so ordinary but down to earth persons playing the corporate real life and legal politics and drama games that competitive jobs often drown us into.  I like that most episodes don't depend on the next...I can watch any episode and get a complete show with whatever ending and not have to wait for next show.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. After feeling that Kathy Reichs had lost her way a little, her last two or three titles have brought her back to the standard of writing that catapulted Tempe Brennan to super stardom. A big thumbs up from me.
B0054R6BFM|4.0|I've never read a Jay Asher novel, and I'm glad he was recommended to me. Very interesting story that sucked me in right away! I need that!! Throughout the story I found myself frustrated that a girl would take her own life over such things,but I forget what it's like to be a young teen figuring life out....I find myself hearing about teen suicide more and more. Awareness is crucial!! I think this book proves that!
B000LX00RY|5.0|Need I say more? Meryl Streep is suburb, and Anne Hathaway's &#34;coming of age&#34; is nothing less than charming. Stanley Tucci is ... well, Stanley Tucci! Funny, poignant, sincere.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Castle keeps you what is going to be next. Can't wait for next season and what new adventures will be ahead.

B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|I highly enjoyed this movie from start to finish. Action packed throughout the whole movie. Brings me back to the old days of Star Trek!!
B003NRYMZQ|4.0|love it ,a totally gripping story line ...easily will hook you ...constantly awaiting the next episode..one of my favorites ..is a take on Fairies...might not be what you are expecting!!!!
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|This flat-footed movie was, on occasion, visual appealing, but I couldn't invest myself in the characters whatsoever. Much of the movie was predictable, slow, and seemed to rip off the better parts of other sci-fi movies and shows much more lapidary than Oblivion. There were also a few rather confusing moments that didn't add anything useful or effective (such as suspense, for example). My favorite parts were perhaps what seemed to be nods to Top Gun.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|I watch a lot of WWII films/movies/documentaries and although this is a &#34;big box&#34; movie, it's fabulous. As a fan of social justice I LOVE watching movies where people save others ... particularly others than &#34;their own.&#34;
B00CS74W0C|5.0|Great books with great characters. I couldn't put the books down. I just might read the series over again!!!! <3
B007HUD6OS|5.0|John Grisham is my all time favorite author. I would read any thing he writes and have read every book as soon as it comes out.<br />I love the Theodore boone series and all of the characters.<br />I read the FIRM on the beach in Cancun when it first came out. There were toppless women every where and I could not put the book down to look it was by far the best book I have ever read
034580709X|5.0|This is quirky in its own way, but an excellent read. A refreshing change from the stuff on TV. A police screw up leads to the death of one of the principle characters.<br />The murderer is caught, but other criminals are not.
B00406O7YK|5.0|Barbara Streisand in her prime. WOW!!! What a voice.<br />In addition to great music, this movie shows well: Great clarity and vibrant colors throughout. What a showpiece for my new large-screen LED TV. If you subscribe to Amazon Prime you can watch this movie and many other's like it for free. What a deal - I signed up for Prime to save on shipping cost (2-day free shipping on most items) and the shipping savings alone have paid for the price of the service. If you are a regular Amazon customer this is the way to go; and the bonus is that renting such movies as this is truely free. Thank You Amazon.
B000MTFDCO|5.0|First off hd dvd even though a dead format you can get great buys on movies that you cant on blue rays and now blue ray is a dieing format with its bigger brother blue ray 4000 out.. So I keep my HD dvd to pick up movies that are hard to find on blue ray or cheaper on HD .<br /><br />The Game Is a classic. It does not use special effects to wow tho masses ,,, Instead it does something that few movies today do ! It uses a story line, it draws you in immerses you into the story and takes you for a ride! Full of action and drama ,,,<br />Even though its an older movie its still one of my favorites . Its sad that today it takes eye candy to sell a film and with out it most are doomed !
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|If you are especting Arnold kicking ass like in the old days, not su much, but he still does his best at 66 on an action movie. Arnorld is a sheriff in a small Southwestern town where some bad guys are going to plow through on their way to the border. Don't look for drama, is about action, blowing stuff and humor.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This  is one of the best mobile games I've ever played. This is money worth spent. If you like strategy games and have a hatred for humanity this is for you.

B003G4W49C|5.0|Read this on vacation. My husband read it to. We thought it was a good story and both enjoyed the read.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the characters, the setting and the interactions of the intertwining family members. The actors make each of the people real and leaves you loving them or in some cases, disliking them.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I'm an oldies movie fan & don't normally watch new films. Not that I hate them but simply I prefer the classics. I read some time ago a list of the top ten's most depressing films in cinema's history. This film won the number one spot and it received rave reviews from noted film critics. I'd decided to watch in its entirely and to my surprise I found it to be one of the best anti-drug movie ever made since The Man With The Golden Arm (1955) & The Panic In Needle Park (1971). There are so many positive feedbacks I can mention here regarding this film. The cast members are played by Jared Leto Jennifer Connelly Marlon Wayans & Ellen Burstyn (who in my opinion should have received an Academy Award for her outstanding work).They share & deliver such unbelievable performances that can be described as electrifying  with uncontrolable desperation. The theme circles about the lives of four energenic adults who fall into the hands of drug addition. Their addictive appetites are evident by their involvements of doing unhealthy acts just to satisfy their unnatual \\"highs\\". The atmosphere can be closely described as deeply nightmarish, but the main focus is the overall transformations that take place from the beginning to the end of the film : or from better to worse. They share a single wish : to get a happy life. The youngsters want to establish themselves by someday owning a legitimate business while Sarah (Ellen Burstyn) finds the \\"remedy\\" to change her body appearance just to see herself wearing a red dress and starring in a TV show. Out of all the main characters who faithfully & realistically play their roles, I find Ellen (playing the character of a lonely widow Sarah Goldfarb) without question the best of all for her pitiful but splendid performance. Empathy is best described for Sarah due to her overdependancy of pills which in turn looming drug demons & dreamlike paranoias overtake  her sanity altogether. Such a grieving moment to find them confind in each of their own lonely but unescapable ends in the finale. Wonderful direction & screenplay by Darren Aronofsky which is supported by a terrific cast. A dark but emotional film I know you will enjoy.n lonely but unescapable ends in the finale. Wonderful direction & screenplay by Darren Aronofsky which is supported by a terrific cast.

B00DQC2FPM|2.0|As a huge BTTF fan, I was excited for this set but after putting it together, I'm dissapointed. This is not the sort of lego set for kids to play with. The end product looks cool, but there are several flaws within the build of the design. The gullwing doors, bumpers, vents, and several other main parts are attached very weakly. These parts fall apart easily even with careful handling.<br /><br />Another gripe I have is that neither Doc or Marty fit inside the time machine, even if you try to stick-in just their torso. The designers could've made the vehicle itself so as to fit the correct proprotion of the figures.<br /><br />In the end, this is more of a display piece instead of a toy.
1577314808|5.0|this book has changed my life completley. They should teach a subject in high school about Eckhart TOlle. EVERYBODY needs to read this to stop living in base of your ego and start apprecitating the now and lifeś gifts.
B000AP04KQ|3.0|The disc does not rewind any faster than the first speed.  It stops when Peter first sits at his desk in the beginning, but continues to play.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This has to be one of the best books I have read in a long time. I haven't had a book hold my interest in a long time.  It makes you feel like you are in this crazy world.  Reminds me of how I felt when I read Jurassic park. You just think when you wake up that this is how the world is now. Scary part is this could happen in the near future if we let it.  Not being paranoid but I cat explain how real and engulfed you become.  How someone thought this up is astounding to me.  I loved it.  A must read for the conspiracy theorist out there, or anyone else.  You won't  be disappointed.  Worth the money I assure you
B0053ZOQMK|5.0|Did not really think this was going to be a good movie based on the trailers I had watched. exceeded expectations
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Gone Girl was my favorite of the three, but this one kept me turning pages just as quickly! Give us , Gillian!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Adam Makos brings the tragedy of war to life for those of us who never donned a uniform or witnessed the utter destruction of lives, of cities and countries in battle. This is a story to be read by all; a wake up to the reality of what happened and an example of what has happened in all the conflicts since then and continue today. The story of brings to life an incredible moment when two men place honor and respect above their sworn duty and answer to a higher calling.<br /><br />It is TRUE REALITY, not the staged drama on TV, but the actions, events and emotions of two men and the people around them who fought for what they believed in and why. I don't often write reviews, but this is a remarkable story and one that has changed my view on those in service for their country wherever they may be. There are always at least two sides; we don't often think about that other side. Makos documents what that \\"other\\" side experienced as well. That two men, both enemies of the other in dire circumstances and facing death could reach out to each other is the miracle of that higher calling. Thank you Mr. Makos for bringing this story to life for all of us to enjoy and contemplate.
0803726570|5.0|I can't wait to read this one to my Kinders.  From the author and illustrator who brought us The Gruffalo here comes Room on the Broom.  Ah! A day in the life of a Witch.  This book takes it's audience on an adventurous journey through rhyme and it's fun illustrations.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The aspects of this book were all excellent. The twists and turns not to mention the ending kept me spellbound. I was not familiar with Liane Moriaty, but will now look for some more of her books
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|A fabulous start to a new era of Doctor Who!  There are many memorable episodes in this season, including &#34;The Empty Child&#34;.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|One of the best new author finds that Ive come across in a long time. I would recommend to anyone.
B0058VW36U|5.0|The game is lots of fun for people of all ages. I enjoy the game on my smartphone, and my 3 year old likes it on his Kindle. Lots of challenging puzzles without a ton of repetition. Not buggy at all!
B0013FYTA8|5.0|I have had this cd for about a month now and I have not listened to any other CD since. It totally ROCKS and the lyrics are kick butt. The singer is AMAZING and as a plus Daughtry did some backup vocal's for one of the songs. This is easily my favorite CD of the moment. I sure glad my friend gave me the heads up on this band.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is awesome, I love how similar it is to Mario even more. It's the coolest free game I've found yet.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|Great show.....I felt like I was with them the entire time....love love love all the characters....many shocking revelations. A must watch.....
B005HEQ4XQ|5.0|This is a show with great plots, and it doesn't leave its characters behind! can you really ask for more?
B003CH9PTU|5.0|Started watching this series recently to see if I could catch up to the ending this year.  Expected it to be intense and good, but am pleasantly surprised by the humor.  Excellent writing, and fantastic performances by all actors, especially Bryan Cranston.  I suspect there will be less to laugh about as mild Walter gets more involved and adept at his criminal life, but this series already has me hooked and I'll see it through to the end regardless.
B006S01GH2|5.0|I try to see this movie about 2 or 3 times a year. Each time it is like getting with an old friend with whom you take the greatest delight in seeing and wonder why you waited so long to reconnect.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Fun romp through the world of clandestine operations.  With Helen Mirren and John Malkovich, what's not to like?  Morgan Freeman, too!
B003WUYRGI|1.0|Sorry I didn't under stand it that well I could not understand the words that we'll love gabbywalton thank u
B003U6BE8I|4.0|This movie (and the sequel) is great 'tween entertainment.  It's kind of a low-budget &#34;Harry Potter&#34; but still keeps the action going.  I haven't read the books so cannot comment on how close the movie was to the books, but was told (by some tweens) that the actor who played the character of Percy Jackson was &#34;too old&#34;.  Hmm, guess everything is relative.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I started off just watching so I could have something to take my mind off my workout but then after about the fourth episode I began to get interested in the characters and liked watching the development.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|The beginning of the book was slow and I thought childish. But it got really good, really quick. I couldn't put it down. There's a twist at the end of the book which will either make you want to read the next ones, or turn you of from the series. Depending on what you're looking to get out of this series. But I loved it.
B001MSMULG|3.0|Yes, I understand it is a spy-thriller.  Yes I am old fashioned but it is just too racy for me.  Too many F bombs.  Too much sex.  Could have been much better without those elements.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I liked it a lot! the price was good, and it took me awhile to figure it all out. cant wait to try more of these.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I am 15, I really enjoyed this book. Funny and touching. I recommend this for anyone looking for a great book to read.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|There is little I can say that hasn't already been said.  We are total fans of all the Harry Potter stories.  There hasn't been a more interesting kid character since the Hardy Boys or Nancy Drew Mysteries.
B00ANA27IU|5.0|I loved this book because this book is plausible, someday we will need to send man to other planets.  Also scary that a computer can be so advanced as HAL.
B000JCSPG0|5.0|Love this movie!!! One of my all time favorites.  Action adventure and a love story all in one. Very entertaining.
B004X80QNG|1.0|Please don't buy.  This app does not sync with anything and when you check with the developers you are told it is a kindle fire problem and not theirs.  Yes if you are selling on a kindle fire amazon store then you are responsible. Instead of removing this one when they released their new software which says it will sync they have left this waste of an app available. Who wants to spend time setting up a calender and tasks with no back up system?  Don't waste your time or money on this one.
0062255657|3.0|While not really a fan of fantasy writing, I thought this was done pretty well.  I agree with other reviewers that some of the characters could have been developed better.  The point of view of a young boy was quite well done.
0544104404|3.0|I though this would be more practical information, instead it is a scholarly work. Interesting, but just ot what I expected from the reviews, etc.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|This is probably my most favorite fantasy movie of all time.  It made me want to be there.....to be an Avitar. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves Sci-Fy, loves the idea of being \\"one with nature\\", and loves watching the good guy against the bad guy.  The visual effects were breathtaking.
B00004RD54|4.0|Prescribed listening for all new music buffs and a &#34;trip&#34; down the lane for those of us who knew how to party in the 70s
B00634GHJA|1.0|I have been able to move my pictures into the cloud and I have confirmed my pictures are there.  I have used only 50% of the cloud space but the pictures have never arrived down to my Kindle.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I bought this book on a whim because it looked interesting, but several chapters in I began to notice numerous similarities between traits explained and traits I possess. By the end of the book, I realized that there is no doubt that I have always been an introvert frequently masquerading as an extravert. Ha! It was very reassuring to understand my need for solitude, deep contemplation, and solo working preferences, as well as the ability to deeply empathize with those in discomfort.<br /><br />The book was laid out logically and was well annotated with relevant data, research, and anecdotes, and despite several chapters/subtopics that shared the same sources, the material referenced back nicely and was not repetitive. The author's voice was approachable, friendly, and supportive, and despite the intelligence of the content, the text was not too heady nor too simplified for prime time.<br /><br />I highly recommend it to folks across either spectrum to help understand themselves as well as others in their social, work, and family structures. I only wonder if the statistic that suggests introversion is increasing has anything to do with our mainstream proclivities toward being attached to digital devices through which we spend a lot of time expressing our thoughts through writing, a singular activity--just a thought.
0345525558|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  Victoria's reactions to people and events showed her troubled past.  The meaning of flowers was very interesting and a nice addition to the story.  The growth of Victoria was well done.  There were regressions to her old ways that were realistic.  She was understandably guarded and took time to trust people.  It turned out that the people she trusted did not let her down.
B0081336FO|5.0|Sherlock is an awesome show and I thought this episode was the best of the bunch! Sherlock in love???????????? Must see!!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Very good series, the characters are a bit rich but that is what fiction is about. Lets you slip away from reality for awhile
B004LOMB2Q|2.0|It was probably a useful app but I never found myself taking the time to give it a proper test.  I still make my shopping lists on a white dry erase board and then before leaving the house I transfer to just a paper list.  That works for me.  Just the old fashion way.
B003E6LC6I|4.0|And yet I was caught up in the intrigues of all these plotting lawyers and manipulative clients.  Mean and hateful yet evolving characters kept me waiting for the next surprise.
0131101633|5.0|Very comprehensive. I strongly recommend it. It thoroughly explains the basics of C language. It is also offered in a good price.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|We were really looking forward to this game because we are big fans of Despicable Me and I would love a minion or two.  We're trying to install it on my daughter's Trio Lite and the installation system won't come up.  The software downloads from Amazon Apps with no problem, but the installation system never comes up.<br /><br />Bummer!!
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|This is a nice alarm clock. This one has weather and different sounds for waking up.  I like the blue color for night time.
B009P3N1GI|3.0|Thought the concept was alright, but didn't quite get the changing-somethings-history thing. Surely changing an items history would cause other items history as well. Like a window that got smashed because a rock was thrown at it - change its history so it was stronger means the rock wouldn't have gone through in the first place. Would have been interesting to see situations like that unfold (Think Homer going back in time and sneezing on the dinosaurs causing the future to rain doughnuts)
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is definitely my best game on my kindle fire! I'm a serious gamer and this is by far my personal favourite! :) It would be even better if you could create and use your own skins... none the less THIS is a great game!!!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This is an interesting series, I really enjoyed watching it. Like it like it like it like it I like it.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|They are typical Star Trek story lines the way all Star Trek series are, always have loved them, and always will.
B005UG542S|5.0|I am a huge fan of the Harry potter series and have seen all of the movies and read all of the books. I wish there were more books and movies to come. I would have liked a book or movie that went back a little and showed how we ended up where we did at the end of this movie (don't want to say anything that would ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen this yet).
B00296A4F4|5.0|Amazing show. Love the songs, the story, the characters, everything! My favorite show right now, I can't stop watching it!
B0070NSPCU|4.0|The first 3/4 of this book were fantastic! Superbly written, very much enjoyed the way it was told, and how it was the main character telling it to someone else, but altering the tale. But the final 1/4 wasn't as good. It kept trying to be all mysterious and I lost track of what was going on for a bit. Still, really enjoyed the characters and I'm looking forward to reading the next one :)
B005ERYEGU|4.0|A must read for a sales team who are serious about leading their market place. CONTROL TOMORROWS RESULTS by reading into the key insights of why you and your sales team are consistently producing roller coaster results!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I just wanted to try this product and i wasn't very pleased with it. But for the price, it is not that bad :)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a pretty fun game, I just wish it had more levels. I enjoyed the creative seek and find element. I would have given it 5 stars if it more rooms to explore!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I am disappointed because it said free, and one needs to buy points or some other thing to stay in the game.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a cool game but the longer you go is taxing to you're staying power the game is so cool
1574214276|5.0|I have become absolutely obsessed with Zen and Zentangle.  In fact, I have ordered about all that Amazon books has available.  I needed a way to calm down and I am not really one to meditate.  This is my alternative method and BOY DOES IT WORK!  Get on the Zentangle bandwagon.  You won't be sorry!
B00821OX98|4.0|Of all the series programs, this is the best! It is very realistic compaired to most that are out there.
B0047SIXGE|5.0|One of the best movies about Vietnam and the sorry mess that we got ourselves involved in. Loved the 1st Calvary attack scene with Wagner music.
0525478817|5.0|This book is amazing!!! A shakespearean tragedy for teenagers is the only way to describe this book. It's character development is phenomenal. Best book of all time!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Refreshingly original with complex characters.  Sanderson's best work to date. Pacing is very effective.  Can't wait for the next instalment.
1574216988|5.0|A great book to exercise your brain and calm down the great way.  Like I said, I'm too old to tie myself in knots, and this book helps me exercise my brain in a less stressful manner.  Can't Say Enough About How Great It Is!
B000VZYPB4|5.0|This is one of those shows that comes along once in a great while. It makes me feel happy to be alive in this generation to watch it. This show makes me laugh, and helps broaden my vocabulary. I was excited to hear that was going to be a seventh season hopefully there will be several more. I love this show, and am anticipating new episodes. Can't wait for season premiere.
B000Q99EAC|3.0|Another trite Rocky movie. I don't how much longer this character can be milked. After the first Rocky movies they should've quit while they were still ahead.
B000PHX4VA|5.0|Great condition.  Cover and CD's are like new.  I am a great fan of The Police, I have some of their CD's but sometimes my CD's get scratched &#34;don't know how&#34;.  I ordered this one even thought it was used...I got great quality from this seller.  I am happy with the purchase and glad I did not buy new.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Absolutely loved this stunning tale of a dystophian future with a strong female lead. It's different than other dystophians, it doesn't give you a worked filled with zombies, but rather a different way that society is ran In the future. Love love love. And there's romance, lots of it.

B000FA5TTW|4.0|I really liked this book. I spent several days reading it.<br />I am only giving it four stars because the ending didn't seem quite right.<br />The ending just I didn't like it.<br />The beginning and most of book I was into what was happening but it seem like at end it could went further but writer just got tired or something.
B00DM0UTPQ|3.0|A fair movie that if put together better could have been a good or a great movie. A good plot that was butchered. Ed Harris gives a good performance.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing book makes you want to read more. I absolutely loved the book. What I loved about the book is how engrossing and well plotted the book is. What I hated is when I put the book down to stop reading, I didn't want to but I had to. But other then that you should read this book and book series!!!!!! This book is absolutely fabulous 😘😍😉☺😊😀😃😄😛😝😜⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
B008469DGY|4.0|It is not as easy as it looks. It is fun and can get harder as you play. If you need something to play to pass the time. This is it.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|If lack of inspiration or initiative is the problem in your art, this book may be for you. Full of ideas and advice to get started or get back at it, Kleon has compiled an easy-to-read resource to remind you why you wanted this life anyway.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I LOOOOOVE THIS GAME!!!! ITS SOOO GREAT!!!!! I CANT WAIT TO GET RAINBOW DASH!!!!!! BRONIES UNITE!!!!!!!! yay! WOO HOO! RRRRRAAAAAIIIINNNNNNBOOOOOWWWWWW DAAAAASSSSSHHHHHHH!!!!!!
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|The worst of the Die Hard movies. A desperate attempt to just throw out a movie trying to cash in on a franchise name.Very disappointing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great app I love it very interesting game you get to care for horses cool teaches how to care for a horse
B003ASLJMW|3.0|So many of today's movies are not appropriate for kids.  I have a grandson who told me when he was 2 that he was going to be a Marine when he grows up.  He loves guns, knives, planes, tanks and anything to do with war.  He will probable want to learn to speak Russian after he sees this movie.  It is not one of Eastwood's greatest movies , but the pilot flying a supersonic jet and thinking in Russian is just what a 9 year old will love.  He works college chemistry and math problems so I'm sure Russian will be something he will want to know.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Could never install on older android.  I am a big angry birds fan.  Played them all! Will keep pl ting as long as they keep coming
0790729628|5.0|After reviewing the film, I found the sound and picture quality to be exceptional. There was no noticeable wear to be found anywhere<br />on the DVD. The packaging was great and prompt service was even better.
B000ID1J40|5.0|Relevant to today's current events. Eerily depicts what is being reported in today's news. What is fictionally depicted about the NSA is alarming.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I bought this for my wonderful boyfriend who loves to take pictures, but hated lugging his items in a standard back pack.  This thing is PERFECT!!  I can attach his tri-pod on the back of it and everything he uses with his camera all at one time.  He LOVES this gift!!
B007SSF3O0|4.0|Movie stays close to the book. Emma is not my favorite Jane Austin's book, so I feel the same about the movie. Acting is not the best, but I love anything with that era. I love to transport myself back in time, so this movie definitely brings you back in time and helps you see Emma's world. Nice movie but not the best one out there.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Very good app,<br /><br />There is a learning curve,but once you view the manuals and setup the app all is good.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed this game very much. It is great brain teaser and good use of your problem solving skills. I love it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|He loved the movies. Now the game's a big hit too:-) He feels it &#34;helps his hand/eye coordination.&#34; It's just plain fun.
0545265355|5.0|I got these for my daughter and she was so thrilled.  She still reads them too.  I'm sure she'll wear them out.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Unpredictable. Gaiman is in good form in this story. I enjoyed it, and it kept my interest from beginning to end. The end was a little bit of a surprise, but makes sense.
B00AEBBAEK|5.0|i love the movie,ty for it,its the best,i love the music,its so cool, i relly love it love it i
B00846REIS|4.0|A wonderful romance book. I really enjoyed the book and moving on to the next book in the series...very good book
B00821PCJS|5.0|This series is really fun. It is creative. GIven that I lived in Boston for three years, I enjoy it all the more.
B000FAGGWQ|5.0|The Empire Of Dreams is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen and I have seen March of the Penguins! The other featurettes add an awesome bonus sparkle to this wonderful diamond that this DVD is with the documentary alone! Highly Recommended!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love how the book holds your attention and doesn't really become predictable.  Can't wait to read the next one.
1118488768|2.0|Reading the other reviews here I cannot help but wonder if there is a single review by a discriminating reader. Every review seems to be marketing the book rather than reviewing it. These reviews do not make me want to buy the book. They kind of repel me away from it.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Great story I like that they split the stories into two different books it is easier.to track.characters that way and keep the story flowing smoothly
B001KTATIS|5.0|I found its  explicity fascinating. Clearly the movie is not for an average movie audience.<br />As a history buff it made me look-up Roman history during that time.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I enjoyed the book.  I find her to be very funny.  Having grown up near where Tina did, I enjoyed the references to the Philadelphia suburbs.  A great distraction!
B009KKLQKO|5.0|loved it.sound was great.band is flawless.i highly recommend this astounding historical performance by one of Americas greatest bands..just love it.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Exciting game.  It took me a while to build up my gold and coin reserves that u can use to buy special gadgets.  These gadgets help to increase your scores.  You need to reach a level to unlock a gadget. Once unlock, you can use your gold or coins to buy the gadget.
B004289ZW0|1.0|For me, this unit has been rock-solid for both syncing with GPS receivers and bluetooth to an iPad.  However, the malfunctioning on/off switch overwhelmingly overrides any positives.  If you pull the unit out of your bag, and it's dead due to a depleted battery, the GPS and bluetooth don't work, and it makes this device completely unreliable -- usually when you need it most.<br /><br />I suspect the touch sensor problem may be heat related as it seems to malfunction more often when the temperatures are warm (like when you've attached the device to your windshield).  Regardless, this device was \\"over engineered\\" with a too-complicated on/off switch that was inadequately tested for real-life conditions.
B001NLKZUA|3.0|Definitely young adult fiction here. I felt like very little happened. Not much progression. The teenagers sure act like teenagers; maybe even younger. Same goes for the adult characters.
B00CU9LHY2|5.0|As a hard-core Smashing Pumpkins Fan, I just loved this! Great amount of extra material... The live disc and DVD are just awesome portraying one of the best SP eras.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|I had never heard of this story before watching the movie; however, my wife has read the books and enjoyed them.  I was pleasantly surprised and actually enjoyed it. It's not a movie I would watch multiple times but I'm pretty picky about that.
0743201140|1.0|I ordered the book new and the code was sealed in the back.  However, upon entering the access code on the StrengthsFinder website, I received a message that the code was invalid.  Multiple attempts resulted in the same error.  As such, I'll be returning the book.  Amazon, please let the publisher know that this is a recurring problem.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think the game is super. It really helps kill timeand the graphics are awesome. It could have more scenery to play in but other than that great.
0060734191|5.0|The Old Kingdom Trilogy books are some of my favorite novels.  I first bought paperback versions of these in 2002, when I was a pre-teen and they quickly made the rounds within my family and my friends.  I have continued to re-read them over the last decade and I have loaned them out many, many times. Each person that has borrowed them, from young adults to my adult cousin (who doesn't like fantasy novels), has loved these books.  In fact they were read so much, that the bindings were beginning to wear out and I decided to buy a hardcover set.<br /><br />If the fact that these books were read so often that they were starting to fall apart isn't a good review, then I don't know what is! Every character has stayed with me long after I've finished the story, and that is what has driven me to re-visit each time.<br /><br />I would especially recommend the books to young adults: the main characters are proactive and smart, but when thrust into dangerous and new situations, they feel self-doubt.  However, each character eventually overcomes that self-doubt and becomes the person they were meant to be.
B007P6VLRS|5.0|For a long time, SP had not released an album that pleased the old-school fan as well as the fan trying to get something new and groundbreaking from this all-time favorite band. Apparently the chemistry between the actual mebers of the band is great and it reflects in this work. This album did it! Thumbs up!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Great movie. Get it. Total departure from the old ones. Chris Pine is killer, and totally sexy. If you're a girl, you'll dig him. If you're a guy, you may want to be him.
B0091XICM0|5.0|Great claymation and special effects for its time. And great action and storytelling for all time. A must watch if you haven't and always  enjoyable to see again if you have.
B00005JKDR|1.0|I purchased this with understandung the condition was like new. However it sidnt play in either dvd because there were so many scratches on the dvd
B007704HO6|5.0|I just loved this book and he has written another one after this but it doesn't seem to be available.  Just wonderful
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Not only can this be a quick pass some time game, it is also a great game to occupy a few hours.
B00B9LNJ9I|5.0|It is so good to have Dido back with another wonderful album.  She just needs to do it more often!  I know, she has a life, but I am selfish!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Great series. As all of the books were. Hopefully there will be more books written to fill in some of the gaps.
B004A8ZWVK|3.0|There are a few good points made in this movie, however I found it became boring about half way through. Even the wife, who loved the book said that the movie was a letdown.
0910315434|5.0|I came across this book by accident one evening almost seven years ago while wandering through a bookstore, still in a state of shock after my youngest daughter's traumatic brain injury. Visiting hours were over in the ICU for the night and I couldn't sleep. I remember seeing the bright green cover out of the corner of my eye, read the the jacket and immediately bought it. Dr.Doidge recounts stories of survivors of brain injury, often demonstrating remarkable recoveries, and explains the science of neuroplasticity, literally the brain's ability to rewire and make new connections. It was a revelation to find that the brain is not fixed and immutable, and the book offered us so much more hope for my daughter's recovery than the doctors did at that point. The information in this book has literally changed our lives and helped direct so much of our rehabilitation efforts. This will be the fourth copy I have purchased - I pass it on to other families with brain injury survivors. A basic understanding of neuroplasticity can inspire hope and recovery after brain injury. I highly recommend it to survivors, families and healthcare professionals

B00A6WSTIW|4.0|You can't beat a good ole shark movie. Jaws, and more. This is right at the top of my list of the shark versus human movies. They can be smart at times. Good special effects, lots of water!!!
B0070UFMOW|5.0|The Dac and amp work flawlessly. It has plenty of power for my 32 ohm Sennhieser earphones but , unlike the earphone jack on audio amplifiers, this sound is not harsh . I wish I had purchased this device much sooner !
B00E0MCYPS|2.0|I found steering in this game to be hard to master. It's way to sensitive and hard to stay on the track. Over-compensates to much. The graphics are good and a good concept but the flaw in steering made me remove the game from my Kindle Fire HD.
B001K3ENEA|5.0|I'm very happy with my order, I don't have no issues just enjoy them. Good buy! I was spectacle to order them, I did fine.

B000FCJZ3G|5.0|This book and the information provided is changing the way I think about money, for the better. Looking back at my past experiences with money, and how these experiences have affected my life allow me to now make the changes required to move forward
031620157X|5.0|Just when you thought there was nothing else to love about Chris Colfer, he comes out with this book!  This is one talented young man (I get to say &#34;young&#34; because I'm older than him.)  He sings, he dances, he acts, he's got a killer smile....and he WRITES?  This is a captivating story for children and even though I'm an adult, I was taken in, too.  I've always loved fairy tales and this one will set everything you thought you knew about traditional fairy tales on it's EAR!!
141659521X|5.0|SORRY THAT VINCE FLYNN HAS PASSED AWAY.  HIS NOVELS WERE GREAT INSIGHT INTO THE WORKINGS OF POLITICS AND THE INNER WORKINGS OF WASHINGTON.  SOMEWHAT LIKE JULES VERNE, HE PREDICTED THE FUTURE IN HIS WRITINGS.

B006MW3UZW|4.0|Great period piece with beautiful costumes, realistic dialogue,  and endearing characters. A little soap-operaish at times but very entertaining nonetheless!
0805028846|4.0|I teach art in a K-12 setting and am looking for things I can do with all ages.  The projects in this book run from simple to quite complicated so there should be something for each age group.  Haven't read the whole book yet but what I have seen, I really like!
0887307280|5.0|This is a very solid, well thought out book about having your own business.  I am very glad that I purchased it.

B0054X3FQO|5.0|The perfect uplifting book. Reminded me of my own beauty and the beauty we all have. I highly recommend it!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is very good with lots of content available for free, while still having enough premium content to make paying worthwhile.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I was a little disappointed at the ending, but it held my interest throughout and was a very good story and she was able to blend all the characters together.  Its a good book.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|This is a charming story with wonderful characters and the delictdful Dorcas is beautifully done. I can't wait tk see where the story takes me in each episode. I hope BBC will continue thF story.
B006PM8EIC|1.0|Okay, so I ordered this a month ago because I truly didn't think Walmart would have it. Well today I was looking for dvds for my son to watch and as I was browsing I came across this exact product for 20 dollars! I feel so gosh darn ripped off. I strongly recommend that you do not purchase this from amazon unless you wanna be ripped off a ton of money plus shipping.  I'm pretty upset! Btw though I can't complain about the product it was the full box set but too much money!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is soooo fun!!! You get to take care of your own horse.<br />You should totally get this game. And its free.
B0049J2CKE|4.0|I liked this movie a lot because it so cute and so easy to just watch.  It made me laugh and made me never ever want to work in a kitchen! Not that I like to cook anyway but I thought if personalities in real life kitchens are like some of these crazy characters then I wouldn't make it.  My chef hat was off to the little rat.  And he is just soooo adorable that you cheer for him throughout the movie and for his human &#34;accomplice&#34;.  This movie is for kids and big kids (a.k.a. adults) alike. And no worries if something you don't want your kids to see is going to happen.  Phew! So, pop popcorn and just relax and have some clean movie watching fun.
B007EECSFA|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I have enjoyed all of Kate Morton's books.  She can tell a good story and keeps you interested until the end.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|I like the move it was different then the normal movie you see and I like movies the deal with SFC
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|Well worth the buy. Really different concept and very do-able, An interesting book with statistics to back it up as well as recipes.
140006922X|5.0|Mr. Aslan communicates intelligently and effectively. He does not demand that you keep a dictionary nearby in order to understand the message he is conveying. Too many non-fiction endeavors read like college textbooks.
B00821PCJS|1.0|I couldn't even get past the first 40 minutes.  I got really bored and I love UFO, Sci-Fi, Alien type movies.  This one stinks.  Maybe I gave up too soon but &#34;Oh Well&#34;.  Maybe the other bazillion seasons are better but I don't usually waste my time if a movie can't reel me in to start. Falling Skies is the same as Falling Asleep..........snore.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Among other self-depricating claims on American Life, Madonna calls herself \\"so stupid\\" for having gone after her dreams; yes, she's displaying more unhappiness on this album more than any other so far.  American Life was a critical and commercial disappointment by Madonna standards - I think the main reason being that people don't want this version of Madonna. They want the Dance/Pop Madonna (she would return to her dance roots on the next album, Confessions On a Dance Floor).<br /><br />The title track is a blazing, fierce fight with our heroine sounding stricken with angst. Though her rap has been criticized, it's the rap finale on \\"American Life\\" that reaches a climax about 2/3rds of the way through; at the point when an additional, harder-edged drum loop is introduced to the mix. Familiar with the holes of depression, I find \\"X-Static Process\\" and \\"Easy Ride\\" to be perfect portraits of what it's truly like to be at those low points. I wouldn't necessarily think of Madonna as one who could astutely describe depression in a song, but she absolutely nails it - twice.<br /><br />While I agree that Madonna's great at delivering her usual heady disco numbers, American Life also deserves a chance. It's acoustic, soulful, heartbreaking, thought-provoking and another solid record from the bravely artistic Madonna. After all the years of pop greatness she's delivered, she's not allowed to be at a low point and express it? I beg to differ.
B00BUADSMQ|4.0|I like this movie because  of the action and took place different then NY and CA which was different good for a change
B00C061I3K|3.0|I really enjoy a majority of Daft Punk's stuff and have been a follower of the group since I picked up Homework on a flyer.  Between buying what I could and finding stuff online, I've probably amassed a collection of nearly everything they've made - even the &#34;other named&#34; side projects.<br /><br />I had this LP the day it came out and still haven't really decided what I think of it.  I gave until 50 full plays until this review.  It's going to receive three stars because what they did just isn't quite working for me this time.<br /><br />I like the idea of going back and doing a disco-esque album.  Everything from the look of the CD to the way the songs are constructed to the &#34;flow&#34; of the album.  The idea was great, but the attempt isn't something I'm going to remember in 10 years, much less next.<br /><br />It's a shame that this album will be remembered for the huge effort to get &#34;Get Lucky&#34; into the mainstream.  They promoted it on darn near every FM station going. Even having the song more like Pharrel than DP, it didn't work as well as I think they wanted it to.  In the end, Robin Thicke will be the artist of summer 2013.  To me &#34;Get Lucky&#34; is only one of numerous. average songs here, with only a couple even being memorable.<br /><br />It was easy to find the best song on the album - &#34;Doin' It Right&#34;.  This was either before or after the disco concept, because it doesn't really fit into the structure of the album.  Maybe that's why it's at the end?  Beyond that there's about 8 tracks of mediocrity and a couple of snoozers - see &#34;The Game of Love&#34; and &#34;Touch&#34; for examples.<br /><br />I'm still a fan and supporter of them.  I'll give them credit for the effort and concept, but maybe not so much on the execution.
B00A8FXT8M|5.0|Glad to see it make it back. Evan improved over the time. A wonderful read.  Five more words now required. Great
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Um what can you say other then AWESOME!!!!!! Way cooler than other games. Couldn't believe it was for free. Totally addicted to this game. one of the best that I know. and btw love the minions
B005ZC0SYQ|5.0|This movie is awesome. I love Branden Lee. He a one of my favorite actors. It sad that he gone and will be missed.
B000HWXS2S|5.0|This is the 2nd album I purchased from these guys, and I was blown away. It's a slower kind of death metal at first listen, but when you get into the groove, it's perfect. Standout tracks are Runes to my Memory, Asator, Hermod's Ride to Hel, Cry of the Blackbirds, and Under the Northern Star. The title track is really the only song that didn't totally grab me with a Viking fist, and I highly recommend this to anyone looking to get into Amon Amarth.
B00EQUP3Q6|5.0|Trent Reznor, NIN, my favorite.  I've seen them six times live, own all their stuff.  That said, this one is different.  But, after about ten listens, I get it.  Very good.  Worth listening to.  Nice work, Trent.
B0018RC7QE|5.0|It was a truly amazing love story.  Streep and De Niro were awesome.  More more more!!!!!!!  I  would recommend this movie to anyone who found true love.
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|This is my second time in watching the series, this time via Amazon Instant View.  The characters all have their strengths and weaknesses and although the series is about taking on aliens that come to earth, the most appealing thing are the characters.  Eve Myles, playing a British police officer, joins Torchwood, headed by the immortal Captain Jack, played by John Boorman, who first appeared in the Doctor Who series.  She has to forget her history as a police officer, although that training does have its use at times, and learn to deal with a world unknown by most people.  The interaction between characters, some times amusing and sometimes tragic, and the magical world that Torchwood touches makes this an incredible adventure worth experiencing again and again.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Just as amazing as the 1st book.... this is my 2nd time reading the series. Better the 2nd time around!
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Couldn't put it down just kept wanting to know what Amy would do next.  Would recommend to all my friends.
B007P6VLRS|2.0|I love Smashing Pumpkins.  Siamese Dream one of the best rock albums EVER.  So good.  However, since Machina, Billy Corgan has started to fade, and fade fast.  This album starts with a good song and then, there aren't any more.  Really bad.  Sorry. It gets two stars because at least the production value is high and Billy Corgan is a musical genius, but... yeah... no...
B00D3NSDVO|4.0|This book kept me interested from the first page. Can't wait for the next one. The characters are well researched and believable. The hero is mysterious but you know enough to feel empathy. Not quite Robert Ludlum but getting there.
B004KPX4W2|3.0|I ordered this movie for my ROKU player.  From start to finish I counted at least 10 interruptions for movie to &#34;reload&#34;.  At least 2x my TV screen went completely blank, only to return after a few seconds.  Very frustrating to say the least.  The movie itself is a very enjoyable one, but the delivery to me was very poor.  I will not be ordering from you any more movies in HD.
B000FBJFSC|4.0|Good reading, would recommend this book to anyone who like reading memoirs.Frank McCourt's books are written well, and will<br />hold one's interest throughout the book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome game in the world the game is a little difficult and real brain thinker well but u games which is so lame
B004WR125O|5.0|Works right out of the box. Great product. Never had any issues with it. Recommend to anyone with an Onkyo Wi-fi capable receiver.
1416972250|5.0|What can I say, I'm addicted to these books!! Absolutely love this series. Highly reccomended. You will not be dissapointed.
B009PMB3CI|4.0|She is 4 and loves this.  She can do it alone and will go back to it. Not great, but good.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The books, amaze, astound, so enthralling that I don't want them to end. I know the movies will never be as good as the books, but they do try their hardest, harder than I have seen them try to bring other wonderful books to life.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|If you love puzzles and problem solving this is a great  game. Highly recommended for all ages. I'm looking forward to additional levels.
1589944607|5.0|I had recently bought A Game of Thrones' board game this year. I loved both of my board games but BSG was much more accessible and whereas i was having difficulty getting a group together to play AGoT, all my friends couldnt get enough of BSG.<br /><br />It is a great game of bluffing that was very enjoyable for all my friends.
0062255657|4.0|Think back to your youth, and how you used to perceive adults, the world, and the mysterious. Gaiman is able to capture that, and the transition into and out of the memory is written vaguely and quickly-just as the details of our memories come and go.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Was on level 210 with over 20,000 coins and everything disappeared! It says debug at the bottom of the screen and this grandma doesn't know how to do that. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

0316201545|4.0|I love the way chris writes but I think the book was too much like the first one, which I love. The story is really good but the ending was too predictable.
B005IQZB14|3.0|Everybody's hike is different.  This book is not so much about the PCT as it is about the author's messed up personal life.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|It's a fun game play if you like challenge it tend to kill time when I'm bored  zombies and samurai
B0064MGU98|5.0|Bravo to all who work on this amazing show.  A great representation of the challenges of women (even though this a more amplified representation).  Character development is detailed but not confusing.  Stimulating, thought provoking, intellectual and dramatic.  Not a poor actor in the entire series.  Great casting!  The best legal drama I have seen yet in television.
B0089LOG02|4.0|When so much of today's entertainment depends on murder,torture,and other sensational devices, this book is a breathe of fresh air. Characters find themselves in bad situations, caused by societal failings and are able to rise above circumstances.  A very readable book, I wanted to read the whole book in one sitting.<br /><br />If you appreciate a good story with interesting characters this will make your day.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Good game not difficult mind work out. .needs a little speed on going to different rooms. Hope there are more levels.
B008KYOCA2|2.0|doesn't alert you to anything unless that app is open. Since there are other things to do on the kindle, I'd think an app that's to remind you of upcoming things should alert you. My cell phone alerts me when an alarm/ calendar alert is due..

B00EQNYOYU|5.0|I have always enjoyed the music from Nine Inch Nail, technically from Trent Reznor. The album continues to showcase the man's musical talents and does not disappoint. The style continues to follow where The Slip (2008) left off.
B00DSOG0QS|5.0|Bodies: Book #1: Staged Fright by Sameer Ketkar is a sexy thriller that is a cool blend of unusual and different. The author has come up with a fresh and quirky approach to a mystery. He uses sex, humor, drama, surprises and fast action to pull the reader along into a dark and exciting story that just doesn't let go. Ketkar needed unique characters to run through his ambitious plot and he invented some truly memorable one. My only complaint is it could have been longer, luckily Book #2 is in the works.
0547978847|4.0|Pros: lovely cover, Good story for kids and adults<br />Con: Not all picture inside are color ones. I prefer whole color edition.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Nice game takes awhile to load, but after its ready to play it's a decent game.I really enjoy the running games.

B00E8JTSVG|5.0|After Beyond Bridalveil Fall I was ready for the next enchanting installment of Dwellers of Ahwahnee. Beyond Oria Falls by Sheryl Seal did not disappoint. While this magical story is populated by shape shifters, fairies and spirits set in fantastical realms, the plot is dramatic and full of action as Oria, the Golden Queen of the Ahwahneechee, continues the battle with the Ala. The author does a wonderful job of weaving the story and painting realistic and creative scenes that make the reader feel part of the story - and that's no easy trick for fantasy. Read Beyond Bridalveil Fall first and then enjoy Beyond Oria Falls, you'll have a great time.<br />I received this copy in order to write an honest review (and would have gladly paid).
0345423496|1.0|When the book starts right up with beings who search the galaxy and nurture young races, then to a tug retrieving ice comets from the Kuiper belt, which against serious odds finds the frozen body of astronaut Frank Poole, I thought: where have I heard these concepts before?  That first reminds one of the 'Uplifted' entities featured in several books. [[ASIN:0441015026 Pushing Ice]] centered around an icetug diverted to investigate an extraterrestrial object. Black Jack Geary was the frozen officer featured in Campbell's [[ASIN:0441014186 Dauntless (The Lost Fleet, Book 1)]] series.  Regardless of the original author, these are familiar notions; however, too much is devoted to Frank's tentative exploration of this future. He is passive, does not cause events to happen. And that is too bad.
B001XV09UG|4.0|I liked this film. Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise were great. I think that Cruise did an excellent acting performance, and the music was good too.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|This is an incredible story with fascinating, engaging characters...you won't be able to put it down, even at 1,000 pages.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great program I will continue to watch season 4. Been watching since the first season. One of the best offered.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I nearly countdown this book after the first few pages because it started about a 17  year old girl and her love for a boy named Billy. I am so very much not interested in a novel about teenage angst!  I have read all of Kate Morten`s books so I went back to Amazon and read some reviews. They convinced me to read on. So glad they did. It's truly a lovely book. Full of mystery and with a satisfying end.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|really no complaints best on phones though. I like the tablet version for it's split thumb design in portrait but for it to get 5stars it would need cursor arrows and shortcuts like thumb keyboard..predictions are what make it (tablet version and phone versions) great.
B004X80QNG|1.0|Had to restart 3 times. Looks like a hot mess an not intuitive. I should sue someone for all that wasted time. Better call Saul!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Kids love playing the game.  It's very kid appropriate.  They all enjoy playing together.  It was free that helps alot
B005544TRQ|4.0|Interesting show.<br /><br />The two leads become close in spite of being very different from each other, and that's where the series parts ways from the typical buddy show.<br /><br />No guns, no violence, but big trouble.  Each episode has a challenge that must be solved by the use of the minds and intelligence of these men.<br /><br />Nice.
B007XGJK4G|5.0|Marley tells the story of the greatest artist of all time, Robert Nesta Marley. Rest in peace Bob, and Jah bless!!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Great game. I recommend this game for children. I love this game love love love this game. It's awesome amazing and fun.
B007G51UV0|4.0|Had to swap out my Asrock Z68 Extreme4 board when it started flaking out. It does everything as most boards out there. The auto overclock option is nice. My only complaint with this board is there is no auto cpu fan control. I know it should be an option because I just swapped my Asrock board out and it was running the fan a lot quieter automatically.<br /><br />Everything else is rock solid and I'm happy.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|great movie family really enjoyed it! action just kept coming. Too bad newer movies aren't offered. moviesa are easy to download.
0770435726|4.0|Pavone has not the slightest idea of what expat living is about. Based on his miniscule 1 year in Budapest or wherever it was he is using to base this anemic story, it is clear that most of it is made up from reading other peoples books. As someone who has worked as a foreign correspondent, based in Bangkok for 18 years, I can attest to the shallowness of his background information on what is involved with expat life in a so called foreign land. And to compare his book with the likes of Le Carre, Greene and others, is a mind numbing experience.
B001TH16DS|5.0|I love my star trek thank you so much for the discs.<br />Can not complain about anything with this product.<br />tl
B008ALAHA4|4.0|Expensive for what it does. But it works good, I have a few of these. Tiny little things are easy to lose :-).
1439156816|5.0|I was never really a fan of Stephen King's macabre, but I have enjoyed his other writing. And I love the movies based off his books.<br /><br />I ordered this because I am starting out on my own writing career and literally (figuratively) everywhere I looked told me to get this book. I took the advice and am all the better for it. I was in the middle of completing my first short story that I was actually pleased with when I read through On Writing for the first time. After I finished reading, I jumped into the third draft of a short story I had already grown bored with, and used a few of the techniques he talks about. The story finally really came alive for me. I have since completed and submitted that story for publication (fingers crossed that it gets accepted), but literally (literally) everyone I've given the final draft to to read has loved it. One friend even compared it to Stephen King. !<br /><br />It's also a very interesting story about his life. How he grew up, some of the things he went through to become a successful writer. How much his wife has helped him. How he got through being hit by an idiot on the road. I'm usually not a very big fan of biographies, but he was able to tell his life story, without it feeling like he was telling his life story.<br /><br />Definitely recommend to anyone interested in writing in any capacity, as well as to all fans of Stephen King the man.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|The storyline keeps you captivated and the added depth from the photographs make this read unusual and beautiful. You will enjoy this book.
B00DY951RQ|5.0|Bob's library of work goes beyond any other artist. Who would have ever thought that an album like &#34;Self Portrait&#34; could have ever had out takes and unused songs that represent what Bob was doing during the late 60's and early 70's. I have listened to this release over and over again and can't seem to stop. What an amazing collection of songs.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I Was Shown This Game By My Brother & I Downloaded It & Now I'm Addicted To It!!!! This Is Like Temple Run But There's Alot More Colour & The Graphics Is Great! I Like Tricky With The Camo Outfit & Lucy With The Goth. It's Great Fun For All Ages!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|its a very good book. i thought that it was much better than the movie. i think everyone should read this
B008220BP2|5.0|My wife and I enjoyed this movie so much in the theatre we just had to own the movie. It is simply amazing and would recommend it to everyone. It has comedy, drama, action, and ZOMBIES!!! What more could you ask for?
B008602KQI|5.0|Good movie with lots of twist and turns.  The story line. action and adventure were very good.  I would watch it again
B00APUQT7I|5.0|I love all the Ice Age movies!  This one doesn't disappoint.  Cute for the kids.  A bit of adult humor mixed in.  Entertainment for all!
B009WUBERW|5.0|This was a really funny satire of all the action movies these guys have made over their careers, from the rip-off dialog to the overblown fight scenes it was hilarious.
0399226907|3.0|This one had a couple of large black magic marker lines on the bottom of the closed pages which makes the book look like something is wrong with it.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Was introduced to this game by my daughter and now I am hooked trying to finish all the quest and she gets mad because I wont let her play.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Disney puts out another cute movie!  I love the obvious kid theme and morals being shown, as well as some of the humor meant for adults. Good movie. :)
B008XCJ03K|1.0|It seems all he sings about is smoking.  There is one good song on the CD. I would not buy it again.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Who doesn't love the world's most favorite serial killer? Can't see where the series can go after this season, though. Is there anyone else left to kill?
B0012QRPU4|5.0|We very much enjoy the Breaking Bad show.  I believe that virtually everyone will enjoy it and be thoroughly hooked after watching only the first 1 or 2 episodes.  Both the writing and acting are exceptional.  It's very sad that the show is ending after the current season.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|I think I expected too much out of this movie because of all the hullabaloo surrounding it. I liked it well enough, the acting was good, but I wasn't wowed like many others were.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I appreciate the simplicity of the instructions. There is comfort in knowing I will be able to publish my own book and not be at the mercy of a techie. If you just want to get the job done, without all the bells and whistles to work around, I recommend taking the time to read this book.
B000I9UA30|5.0|I couldn't think of a more well-written, rousing salute to the Fourth of July. Shame it takes aliens to unite the planet!
B0063M22QO|5.0|I like this type of game.  I play it all the time.  I have shown my granddaughter how to play and now she plays it all the time.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Awesome movie.  Love the minions.  Can't wait for part 2.  Great for kids and adults of all ages.  Must buy.
B008469DGY|5.0|Just picked this up as free app of the day - so glad I looked at amazon that day.  Graphics are awesome, game play is easy to figure out, and it is challenging but not frustrating.  Loaded it on Nexus tablet and HTC Evo phone - great on both.  I highly recommend it.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Great cast, great effects, and wonderful mindless entertainment that Hollywood is so adept at producing. We'll never get enough of this.
B0096CDG0O|1.0|What once was a great game has been ruined by updates that cause more issues then improvements.<br /><br />For the last week I have waited for turns and nudged all of the 10 games saying other players turn just to find out later they had taken there turn and the system only reflected this by opening each game.<br /><br />Play is now slow and don't even bother playing the tournament because you will roll nothing but garbage.<br /><br />Another issue is you more times then none , will roll the same dice to get the same dice you just rolled (ex. You have 3 fives and want to roll the 2 and 4 in hopes of getting more fives, for the next two rolls you get the same 2 and 4 each time).
B00E0MCYPS|5.0|Visuals are great, physics aren't obviously broken after a single try. Looks like there's room for me to get better at it, to learn with practice, aka replay value. And it requests no system permissions, hooray!
B00BD62X14|5.0|I love to hear Carla sing even though I confess after 3 years of French in high school and colllege, I remember very little French.<br /> I just like to hear her voice and the catchy tunes!
B0038NN3B4|5.0|This book not only explains each stage of the Atkins diet but also the logic behind it, what to expect, and how to succeed. And instead of feeling bogged down in the details, you feel empowered by the knowledge and tools for success that it gives you.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Though it's not on a par with &#34;Breaking Bad,&#34; this is an entertaining series, much better than the normal drivel on most channels.
0312430000|5.0|I thought the book was kind of slow, but what I learned from reading this book has change the way I do things in my life.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|I loved the carries and I cannot wait for the movies to come out if there is one. I would read the third one tonight but I can't my mom won't let me.  :(  I think that parents should let their children read but for someone like me I would read constantly if I could
B007THA4FI|1.0|That was the worst book I have ever read! I kept reading in the hopes that it would improve. It did not!
B009MO5G90|5.0|Have you ever had the hots for a regular looking nurse just because she was wearing those fleshy nylons and those retarded orthopedic shoes with the thick soles? And, you just knew you had to have her, or you would be living a dream unfulfilled? If so, you just might be weird enough to fully appreciate this Trashy Actioner.<br /><br />The first time I saw this I was a little disappointed, to say the least. But, I was in the wrong mood. My bad. The second time I saw this, I had been up all night, and in the morning, I was dizzy with mental fatigue. I was in a somnambulistic trance. That fearful drooling vegetative state when you finally realize you've pretty much wasted your entire life in front of the idiot box and you've accomplished absolutely nothing of any value whatsoever. While the credits were rolling, sitting naked in my boxer briefs covered in Cheetos' dust & chocolate milk, the potato glaze of insomnia had finally wore off of me. Everything in my sedentary life was going as I had planned, but I knew that I needed to make a serious reassessment of this flick.<br /><br />PLOT: Something about the Umbrella Corporation making the t-virus available to all the NWO powers, touching off a brand new arms race. A sort of bio-arms race, if you will. Then of course, the whole world mutates and humanity gets eaten, leaving very few survivors. I'm not kidding! The Red Queen goes homicidal once again in an underwater Russian Hive that clones clones clones, and clones more t-virus warriors in a sort of Disneyland gone mad \\"It's a Small World\\" battle simulator. Into this mess steps Albert Wesker, Alice, and all the rest of the characters from the RE video game universe. It's like an RE high school reunion. Only with clones. They're the only hope for humanity. And they're armed to the teeth! Seriously! To all you science deniers: this is not a question of IF THIS WILL HAPPEN?... but WHEN!<br /><br />CLONES: Did I mention clones? There are so many clones, it makes George Lucas' Attack of The Clones look like... like... not that many clones. The Michelle Rodrigruez clone gets killed so many times I think I lost count.<br /><br />WEAPONS: Guns. Lots of guns. Machine guns, pistols, machine pistols, and a couple of RPGs. The zombie clones are the only ones that are allowed to have the RPGs. Makes sense to me. And WOW! Tons of epic acrobatic kung fu fists and flying kicks. BE FOREWARNED: There is some serious zombie neck cracking going on here.<br /><br />MUTANTS: Lots of those. The gigantic baghead guys with the big meat tenderizing mallets & the lickers with the brains sticking out on top. I'll tell you what... they go down hard.<br /><br />3D: Yep. Bullets and those big meat hammers come flying out at you. You WILL duck. I swear!<br /><br />CARS: So many cars blow up, this flick is going to revitalize the auto industry and turn Detroit into a prosperous city of gold once again. There's even a Rolls Royce with pimp spinners doing brodies. I think I just shed a little tear.<br /><br />ACTING: Forget it. There is none to be found here. But it must be said, the guy that plays Wesker is so CGI that I thought he WAS CGI. (He's not CGI, is he?) And all girls in this are wearing tight outfits. It's so hot. What's NOT to like? I developed a major crush on Michelle R years ago and I'm in Michelle Rodriguez Heaven. I'm gonna marry her some day. I promise. But, I have no desire to spend any more time in prison so I can't really stalk her. Hmmm, it's a dilemma. I'd write to her, but she'd only reject me and then I'd be crushed. I guess I'm destined to be alone with my sad loser fantasies. But, I bet I'm not the only one here. Guys? Show of hands?<br /><br />BUDGET: Yeah, they spent some serious cash on this. I read that it was 65 million, but it looks like they spent at least 66 million on the submarines alone. It doesn't always show, but it's there.<br /><br />SEQUEL: Oh Hell YEAH! Best ending EVER. I was eagerly anticipating the final Hobbit films,but now... I can't wait to see how they wrap this up.<br /><br />I love Paul W.S. Anderson. When he dies, they should bronze his body and put him on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. I mean it! I love this movie sooo much I'm starting a National Resident Evil Retribution Call-In-Sick Day. So far my record is 3 times in a row. I won't sleep until I've watched this 10 times in a row. This movie deserves a special award. I haven't figured out what kind yet, but it should come with a special trophy with a chocolate chip cookie on top. It's that GOOD! I'm dead serious.<br /><br />BUY THIS!but now...

B0070Z4M4I|2.0|HORRIBLE! I LOVE Mary Elizabeth Winstead, but she should've said NO to this garbage. The aliens/mutations were absolutely ridiculous and stupid, and they alone sunk the whole movie. The original was great (for its time) and Kurt Russel's was ok, but I expected a whole lot better given our evolved creativity and technology.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|An amazing book. You can't put it down. You are going to want to buy the rest of the books to keep reading!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|great movie. perfect condition. have a towel to cry into if you watch this. i love it.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Loved it. Couldn't put it down. Got invested in characters. Loved how the characters were intertwined with each other. Intriguing.
1611762359|5.0|I very quickly found myself engrossed in this storyline. I felt Ms. Moyes had wonderful plot and character development. She was able to create (very successfully) multidimensional characters that come to life and were very relatable. The dilemmas they face were depicted very accurately and realistically. I highly recommend this book, & will be looking into reading more by this author.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|First racing game I but with money and I could only say that it was worth it. One of the best games out there
B00030EIXW|4.0|Quite frankly I was a little disappointed in this DVD due to my overblown expectations from all the accolades and rave five star reviews this DVD was getting. So I write this review for others like me who are looking for the best performances from an audio perspective only. If you are buying this DVD for the total live audio and visual concert experience then you probably won't do much better than this in these symphonies.  Kleiber's free wheeling conducting style is entertaining to watch and this DVD provides a great document of a rare occasion. The orchestra sounds a bit recessed but nothing too distracting. If you are buying this DVD primarily for the sake of getting the very best performances of these works then you can do better elsewhere.  While the the seventh is excellent it is not in my top tier of performances, the fourth symphony is just very good but nothing special. My favorite Kleiber seventh is his previous recording in `82 with the Bavarian State Orchestra. It is a more gripping and attention riveting performance from beginning to end than this one.  On the other hand, on DVD, Herbert Von Karajan and the Berliners provide two of the most electrifying accounts of these symphonies I've ever heard in a series of recordings made between 1968 and 1973.  The only drawback is visual: the seventh symphony was staged without an audience in an unusual visual arrangement accompanied by some questionable camera directorial decisions.  On CD, Leonard Bernstein with the New York Philharmonic and Colin Davis with the Royal Philharmonic are just about an even match in the 7th with Karajan/Berlin on DVD.  For the fourth symphony, Leonard Bernstein/NYPO also give a hard to beat, magnificent, and riveting account.
B003QSPO9K|5.0|This film paints a different perspective of the Japanese nightmare than so much of the pap that Hollywood usually puts out. Very realistic depiction of how our servicemen really felt.
0743297334|1.0|If I had a \\"Whaa??\\" shelf, this would be the first book on it. This \\"masterpiece\\" is about some WWI vets who drink a lot, ride a train, and see a bullfight. The end. I like opaque books, but I could find more symbolism on a Chinese food menu than in this book. (Does the beef make a good father figure in number 26, the \\"Happy Family\\"? And how could he, when number 25 is shrimp fried rice?)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very good game.<br />Amazing<br />Good graphics<br />Hood missions<br />Very good tome passing<br />I play this game mostly<br />Mostly recommended game
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|You must read this book. I thought I would hate this book since the subject matter sounded so depressing. I thought, who wants to read about a deformed young boy with multiple birth defects that is being teased and tortured by everyone. Well not only did I enjoy this book but I think it should be required reading in all schools and all parents. It gives a new perspective on bullying and what it means to be a human being. The main character is such an inspiring young boy in every way. He melts your heart. I do not want to give the story away so I will not say too much more. It is a well written page turner that will teach you about life and compassion.
B000QRIGJY|4.0|I love the human-ness of Bosch.  Connelly does as good a job with the nuances of Harry Bosch as he does with Mickey Haller, and it's a pleasure to have them in my library!!
1594481938|4.0|This is a story of four individuals who meet on a roof on New Year's Eve. Each is intending to throw himself off the roof, but begins to interact with the others instead. The story is told first person from each of the four perspectives - a 50-something woman with a handicapped son, a 40-something D-list celebrity with a scandal in the news, a 20-something pizza delivery guy who dreams of being a rockstar, and a smarmy teenaged girl with a missing sister. The book chronicles their evolving \\"friendship\\" and their attempts to overcome their depression and underlying family issues.<br /><br />I loved hearing each of the voices. Jess, the teenager, was my least favorite, but she was supposed to be. Maureen, the middle-aged woman, was likely my favorite. Her voice was so sweet and sad, and her perspective was so unique.<br /><br />I appreciated that this book didn't make light of true clinical depression, but did make us question whether all of the characters were actually suicidal - whether they really would've jumped off the roof if the other three hadn't appeared that night - something they come to question themselves.<br /><br />Though this deals with serious issues, it is pleasant to read. Each character changes in some way by the end of the book, and in ways that I found realistic.<br /><br />I hated this the first time I tried to read it, so I'm glad I waited a few years and tried again. I will be trying How to Be Good next.

B004UID2LC|1.0|Just crap! Nothing but advertisments! DON'T DOWNLOAD!!! Its nothing more than spam and malware. Rubbish. No good. Slow and won't download videos
B006O2QNOU|5.0|This could happen at any time! Manipulation of the market for corporate greed. I felt the overall idea of a market crash  over took the struggle of the characters including Spacey's role but you felt sad about good people compromising their values for the sake of the company or survival...... I could never stand such pressure!
030758836X|5.0|I fully expected to hate this book. I often find super-popular, over-hyped books disappointing, or even not worth finishing. Popular fiction and thrillers usually aren't my thing. But oh my gosh, there is nothing excessive about the hype for this book.<br /><br />So it's a thriller, but smart too, something along the lines of In the Woods, but even more suspenseful and with less police procedural. It's all twists and turns and mind games, keeping me engaged but shedding light onto the human condition, which is what I like about literary fiction, my favorite genre. (view spoiler)<br /><br />I waited behind 65 people to get this electronically from the library, and it was worth the wait. I read it feverishly last night and throughout the day today. Easily one of the best books I've read this year, maybe ever. But I don't think I'll be able to wait for months before moving on to Dark Places...book store, here I come.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|This book says what I always believed, which is to succeed, you need to copy a role model, or in the case of artistic expression, other people's work. This is NOT about plagiarizing, however. It is about how to organize your thinking and vision in a way that has proven to be successful.<br /><br />*Every* student should read this, whether an art student or not. Teachers, especially, should pay attention and incorporate techniques suggested in this book into their classes.<br /><br />How much to I love this book? I've re-read it several times and plan to read it more in the future. Something about what it says awakens in me the value of other people. Maybe some day I'll write about how the stealing should be done.
1451626096|4.0|I love old English history.  The White Princess was fascinating in that it was from a woman's point of view and an actual woman at that.  The historical events were real, the people of consequence were real.  I gave the book a &#34;4&#34; because some of the plot seemed a bit too far fetched to be plausible.  Still, once I started reading I had a difficult time putting it down.  I read the whole book in 2 days.
B00881VLCE|3.0|The original version was Great, However I just receiver an up dated version and<br />The new version will not always do the 72 piece puzzles on the September Free puzzle down load.<br /> I get a message saying Magic puzzle has stopped.<br /> This also happens sometimes with the 143 piece selection.
0374214913|2.0|This was a fun little mystery. The characters were likeable and I loved the atmosphere the author created. I thought this read more like YA fiction than adult, given the resolution to the mystery and the ending in general, but I enjoyed reading it and think it would make a nice summer read for those who haven't read it yet.
1451629192|3.0|I am absolutely sure that this is a great book. The subject matter, however, was too sad for me to go past the first chapter. I hope that Jaycee Dugard's life is no longer stolen . . .
B00A6CT012|5.0|Absolutely great.  It has simplified my life and made me more conscious.  Glad I was channel flipping the day Bea was on the Jeff Probst Show.
0316228583|1.0|By having the 2nd ever sold book (HP series) in terms of quantity in the history of the humankind, Rowling created a brand for her name, possibly one of the strongest brands in the world and definitelly in the literature field. Million army of fans was ready to buy Hogwarts library books, the tales of beedle the bard, and the foresaken Harry Potter encyclopedia that will never appear, unfortunately. So what does she do? She destroys that brand by going in completely different niche. From childish, teen type of a book that actually suited perfectly even adults into some dirty and nasty book that made me vomit. It is like, if Maybach started to produce Smart type of cars from tomorrow. Totally illogical, nonsense. Who is she now? What can we expect from her? Another adult book that depicts the ugly parts of our lives? Instead of being number one in the teen niche of the book shops, she digged a grave for her name and her brand. It does not matter whether you liked or not the book so much. It matters that Rowling moved into another direction. It is up to you to like it or not. However, it is utterly disappointing that the possibility of seeing HP like books is vanishing year by year. And who else, if not Rowling, could give us those magical hours of reading and rereading the book?  Excuse me, but there are thousand of writers in the same adult genre and if I want something more realistic and criminalistic, I will 100% find a good book in the nearest book shop. But WILL YOU FIND A GOOD book for your children that will keep them away from computer? I doubt that.
014017821X|4.0|Anyone who is interested in fairy tales, the supernatural or even horror will find something to like here. And truth be told, I like none of those things and still enjoyed this book. These are dark stories based on traditional fairy tales. Bluebeard might've been my favorite story (though it was also the creepiest), but I liked nearly all of them. The only ones I didn't like were the couple vampire/werewolf stories at the end, but those would probably actually be a draw for some readers.<br /><br />The writing is quite good, and I also liked the formatting. The longest story was probably 20 pages, and a couple are only one, so you can read a story quickly and move on to something else.<br /><br />I highly recommend these as a change from your usual reading. These really should be classics.
B005544V6A|5.0|Finally, a series that is not all about dead bodies, rather looks at the many other faces of the legal profession.  And what beautiful faces portray them!!!!  I love the series.  Thank you USA network.
B001HC8516|4.0|I liked the Very easy format and information. Laid back, real discussion delivery. Great message all women need to hear.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I sent this to my grandson who is stationed at Ft Jackson, SC in basic training. He and his buddies were thrilled to have DVD, especially since they could not leave base to go to a movie. This uses a classic!
0380807343|5.0|This is a fantastical book about a girl who finds a hallway in her new house, where her parents see only a brick wall. Behind the wall is her \\"other\\" family, button-eyed versions of her parents and neighbors. There's also a really entertaining cat.<br /><br />I can't explain it, but it's a must read, and a quick read at that. Though it was published as a children's book, I swear nobody under the age of 23 should read it. The drawings gave me goosebumps, and the story is flat-out scary. Even my 36-y/o husband was like \\"That cover is creepy!<br /><br />Long story short, Neil Gaiman is the man.

0812983459|5.0|The reviews calling this book silly or likening it to a fairytale or making Harold sound like a cute bumbling hero are baffling to me. This is one of the saddest books I've read. Sure, there are plenty of lighthearted encounters and quirky characters, but there is an undercurrent of sadness throughout. Harold's relationship is broken, his mind is plagued by anxiety and depression, he had a terrible childhood, he struggles with alcoholism, he has nothing to look forward to, he wonders what the point of his life is and knows that at the end it won't really matter. He sees the darkest parts of his world with the greatest clarity and constantly worries that he's inconveniencing others.<br /><br />Maybe my problem is that I'm overly sensitive, that I relate too well with the ways Harold thinks. Normal people focus on the good stuff, so they see all the silliness and are able to make Harold a caricature because he has duct tape on his shoes and writes postcards. But he's so real, and so sad. The story is told delicately and Joyce gets into Harold's mind so well that I KNEW him. Nobody else in the book knows Harold, but the reader does. And that's freaking cool.<br /><br />I loved the inclusion of many types of characters, good and bad. I liked that it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows. I liked not knowing how it would end. I loved the \\"love\\" story, and the mystery and the subtleties. Sometimes it's worth being bummed out for a couple hours to read a really good story, and I'm so glad I did.

Needless to say he was getting restless. I handed him my kindle with this game open. Kept him busy for two hours.  I think he had a very good time playing factory balls. So where is factory balls 2?
0307341550|3.0|Reporter Camille Preaker returns to her hometown to cover the story of two murders of young girls. While investigating, Camille lives with her mother, step-father and much younger sister. She also lives with the memory of her deceased sister, who died when they were both quite young.<br /><br />In researching the murders, Camille befriends a member of law enforcement and makes her way into the lives of the families of the dead girls. As the book progresses, Camille gets to know her highly dysfunctional family better and exposes secrets about their little town that nobody could've guessed.<br /><br />It was interesting, but not as creepy or suspenseful as I expected. I found the bad characters fascinating, but the protagonist was a little flat. The twist was good, though.<br /><br />Maybe my expectations were just too high, because Gone Girl was amazing.

B000QRIGLC|3.0|Although this was a fast read it lacked the depth that I had hoped for. The writer in spite of more or less saying how humble he is seemed to be tooting his own horn in an indirect fashion. I'm glad he survived. I thank him for his service to our country.
B0087ZG7HK|5.0|I'm sure the sequels are more sophisticated with updated technology, but I loved this one.  Lots of action - those velociraptors after the children had us all screaming - and the story was very good.  I've watched it several times, and decided I wanted it in my collection.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I didn't think I would like the book when I first started reading, the jumping of the narrative was confusing. Then I caught on and was hooked by the fantastic style the author used was like hearing, seeing ,feeling and experiencing history. Not your typical zombie book.<br /><br />What can I say I loved the book, the way it was written was brilliant. It's a must read even if your not into the undead, I love fiction and can't figure out what format category this fits into. It's definitely in a class by itself a fantastic writing performance.
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|im a huge bsb fan and so happy they came out with a new cd. I love it love it love it!!!

B00AZMFK3K|2.0|There were a lot of great things about this movie. Great action. Interesting designs. And a fun plot.<br /><br />But at the same time there were a number of serious flaws with the movie that I have a hard time overlooking but I'll limit myself to two.<br /><br />1) Kirk throws up his hands and gives up. The Kirk I grew up appreciating never gave up. He took no win scenarios and turned them into victories. But in the bleakest moment in this movie Kirk almost literally turns to his crew and says \\"Welp, sorry. I guess we're all gonna die now...\\"<br /><br />2) The abuse of Trek tech to thoughtlessly move the plot forward. I won't go into detail here because I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone who hasn't seen it but I will say this. There are two instances in the movie where the writers essentially took the easy way out of plot problems by abusing tech, and furthermore the way they do it breaks the universe. One involves teleportation and the other wraps up the end of the movie. This would have been fine if we were talking about some generic sci-fi action movie but not as Star Trek.<br /><br />In short if you're not that big of a Trekkie (Which is fine) you probably won't have any issues with this movie. However, more hardcore fans who care about the lore and history of Star Trek will probably find a number of faults in Star Trek; Into Darkness...

B00CUKTGNU|5.0|It's been 4 years, and finally the men from Franz Ferdinand have once again blessed us with a delicious compilation of class, catchiness and pure rock n roll ora! Perhaps I am easily swayed, because FF is one of my favorite bands out there; nevertheless, I feel this album like the three before it is yet another example of how talented these guys truly are. Furthermore, I recommend you go with the deluxe version. The live track Can't Stop Feeling on the deluxe edition is worth the extra money on its own. Looking forward to seeing these guys at Highline Ballroom! Crossing my fingers that they will one day grace the stage at radio city!! Go out and buy this album as well as the previous 3 albums if you haven't done so already. Cheers!

We all face change, but the move forward only begins when there is a realization that change is needed and is a good thing.  The book lays out a clever and nonthreatening way to define the need and implement the change . Read it more than once; mine the iceberg!

B00AZMFK3K|3.0|Quick Customer WARNING: Before I review the movie, you should know that this is essentially a very-bare-bones style release. All it has are barely 42 min.s of EPK behind/scenes stuff ....and that's it. No commentaries, no deleted scenes, nothing else. Other material is only available on-line or as the exclusive of certain stores' editions. Anyway, those of you who care about extras are being cheated.  Details can be found in all of the discussions on this page's forum below, and also at the digital bits' review of this blu-ray.

([[ASIN:B00471JSRE Star Trek [Blu-ray]]]<br />So this is a review based on first viewing / first impressions.<br /><br />In terms of quality, this movie is all over the place. And so is its plot. Plot-lines are dropped, and the conspirators' evil plot(s?) never really make any sense, partially because none of it ever really comes together in the end. And, yes, yet again, the action occasionally gets way over the top, sometimes adding to the nonsensical feel of the movie. There's also a nice little brief encounter with (quasi-Goth??!!) Klingons.<br /><br />&lt;&lt;&lt;SPOILER PARAGRAPH: My biggest problem comes later in the film -- what starts as a nice parallel to movie 2 (WoK) becomes another travesty, another example of Trek's refusal to permanently kill off a main character. A great dramatic opportunity gets utterly wasted by a last-minute super-miraculous (even by 23rd-century standards) cure. Dammit! And so we end up with a mega-overdone-Angry Spock (tm), just so he can lose control enough to get into a massive brawl and beat the tar out of the villain. Jeez, talk about a letdown. The first half was --however haltingly-- potentially leading into a riveting story (albeit re-using a bunch of characters and concepts from ST2), only to waste weepy time on a false death and lead into a literally overkill fight sequence, and more brutal action facing up against a super-militarized starship.

B004XWLN20|5.0|The complete 10 season set was priced at a good value - well below the purchase of the 10 seasons separately.  They came in a durable hard cover with sleeves for each set of seasons.  Well designed for keeping them safe and organized.<br />I ordered the set on Monday and they were delivered Tuesday - we were expecting to wait until Wed but they shipped extra fast.  Wonderfully well done and great for the birthday present I gave to my grandson.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|It's a great product with 4 sound effects and a light that is closer to blue than the older version which was more purple. However the area where the pen is keeps falling off on mine and I've had to super glue it to keep it there. I use the pen actually all the time in fact I filled out a job application with it too. It's truly a Fan-TAS-tic toy for all ages of Whovians.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It was very easy to use and setup.  Please note, that to initially configure the chromecast, you cannot use a hard-wired computer to communicate with the Chromecast.  You need to use a computer that has a wifi connection, or a tablet/phone that has a wifi connection on the same wifi network as the chromecast.<br /><br />Once the chromecast is configured, you can easily use the hardwired desktop to cast to the chromecast.  I recommend this item, especially if you were lucky enough to get in on the netflix deal making the chromecast only $11 :)

B0026RLM6Q|5.0|This is so neat and the music is outstanding.  I recommend this to anyone.  I have the movie of this and it is about teenagers falling in love and growing up.  In the growing up period they go there separate ways and then get back together and realize they were still in love.  It is an absolute wonderful mini series.  I could picture growing up with some of these teens and experiencing some of the heartaches and joy in their lives.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|The good thing is that it is cheap.  Very cheap.  After the Netflix promo, it's only 11 bucks.  However, more than a month later, still can really only use it for Netflix and YouTube.  That's so typical google.  It is almost like that have forgotten this product.  Kinda useless at this point since there are so many other ways to do what it already does, and better.  Still hopeful, however.

147674355X|5.0|This was a wonderful read. I wasn't sure when I first started reading it and sky was so angry. As you learn more about her and her life it all makes a lot of sense. This was very well done and these characters seem like you know and understand them. Quite interesting to see them as real people with lots of emotion and passion including Holder. This was set up very well and how it progressed was natural and I could see this actually happening. There were some surprises at the end which made things make more sense. Sky is a very strong gal that you really like and can relate to who has a great outlook on life<br /><br />This book was one I won on goodreads and I am really glad I got the chance to read it!!

B000006MS3|5.0|One thing about the majority of Kate Bush fans is that they will take anything she gives and praise it as the best thing she's done. I just don't understand the wide-eyed droves that offer that blind praise. But for the discriminating fan of more than 25 years, that being me, The Dreaming is leaps and bounds above anything Kate has done in the past 25 years.<br /><br />Back in 1986, my sister brought over a VHS tape of The Whole Story and recommended I give it a look. I remembered Kate's name from the early 80's, having seen 'The Dreaming' on a TV show called MV3, though the song didn't stick with me at the time. I watched The Whole Story tape and was immediately struck by the insane 'Sat In Your Lap' video, and the bizarre 'The Dreaming', which now made an impression on me. Upon repeated viewings, additional songs caught me. I bought some of the albums I could find at the time, but The Dreaming was one of the last I found, and was the one I was most eager to hear. I was not disappointed.<br /><br />What can I say, but this album is infested with creativity all over the place. But the buying public was already a little weary of this album, and it's known for being Kate's lowest selling album at the time. Even the singles released made very little impact, despite their creativity. 'Sat In Your Lap' was already a year old when the album was released, but opens it nicely. Though the single charted just outside of the UK top ten, further singles faltered. 'The Dreaming', with its durge-like sound and Kate's strange Australian accent, rambling nearly unintelligible lyrics (luckily, the album came with lyrics), charted outside of the UK top forty, and a planned 12 inch single mix of the song was shelved, (is it still in the EMI vaults??). By the release of the playful 'There Goes A Tenner', buyers stayed away and the single failed to chart. But time has been very kind to The Dreaming, and it remains a true fan favorite.<br /><br />Kate doesn't sacrifice the beauty that her voice can offer entirely for the sake of being odd, as displayed in the breathtaking 'Night of the Swallow'. Kate's vocal range and musical diversity know no bounds, and she presents the Gothic tinged 'Leave It Open', and better yet, 'Get Out Of My House'. She screams, wails, and turns into a mule, accompanied by some pretty amazing drumming. And thankfully for fans, Kate produced a total of 4 music videos for the album, 'Suspended in Gaffa', as well as 'There Goes A Tenner', could be viewed on an earlier VHS release, The Single File. But not everything on The Dreaming works for me. 'All The Love' and 'Pull Out The Pin' do tend to get on my nerves.<br /><br />Kate Bush would hit her worldwide commercial peak with Hounds of Love in 1985. And while that is a great album, all of her future releases would start moving into a safe Adult Contemporary zone, to the point of being virtually unlistenable. What a shame. Perhaps if The Dreaming was more of a commercial success, Kate would have continued channeling those carefree spirits, and we could have had more music of such diversity. But let me finish this review by stating what some of the ignorant state about any new Kate offering that comes their way: This is Kate's masterpiece!

B00EVN2D3O|5.0|This movie had an incredible opening all the way to the ending.  I did not want it to end.  Very exciting, gets you thinking and engaged in the movie.  Many times during the movie my son kept saying \\"unbelievable\\" it was so exciting.  This is my new favorite movie of all time.  I am not a movie fanatic, I don't buy movies for myself perse, and I normally do not watch movies again but I will certainly watch this again tomorrow.  It is that good!<br />The entire cast was the perfect concoction of what makes an incredible storyline acted by the best.  I am going to buy this movie - and I'm not the type that does.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|I liked the cast in this film, and the trailer intrigued me so I rented it.  I was not as impressed with it as I expected to be.  For one thing, the viewer really never gets to know the four magicians in the film.  Their main role in the film is to perform on the stage doing magic tricks.  While it's true that a couple of the tricks are somewhat spectacular, the viewer never really connects with the magicians.  There is a better connection with Mark Ruffalo's character and Morgan Freeman's character, but there too, the viewer never really gets to know either of them well enough.  The result is that watching the film feels like watching a performance instead of becoming absorbed with the story.  The relationship between Ruffalo's character and the Interpol character never really takes off either.  At the end of the movie, I was left wondering why they were even thrown together in the film.  Overall, I think this film is worth a view--once, anyway.  I will probably never watch it again.  It just didn't captivate me, and I think it had a lot more potential than it managed to achieve.

1416562605|3.0|This was the fourth time an India born author won the Booker prize.  This was the second time an India born author won the Booker prize for the first literary work.  This was the time two novels of two Indian authors were in the list of nominees for Booker prize.  No wonder, more than 200,000 copies of the Indian edition of this book were sold very quickly.<br /><br />The book sets its plot in three contrasting locations of India - perhaps to show the contrasts and contradictions that exist in an everyday Indian life.  It starts at Bihar, till last decade Bihar had a perception of being one of the backward states in all aspects - economy, law and order, and caste divide.  The plot shifts to the national capital Delhi, a city where politics, bureaucracy and economic divide are on the air to breathe and live forward.  Finally, the plot shifts to Bangalore (now Bengaluru), the IT capital of the country and where the entrepreneurial spirit can be set alive.<br /><br />The story is centered around a man who lived the life of each of these locations.  The story is centered around a man who settled to the terms of life offered by each location.  The story is centered around a man who didn't give up his spirit to try out one more time, the same skill of driving in another location as another job.  The story is centered around a man who didn't mind living another identity.  The story is centered around a man who refused to be in the proverbial rooster coop.  Finally, the story celebrates entrepreneurial Indian.<br /><br />The flow of the story is smooth, the language is smoother.  If you know the various locations of India and its social and economic settings, it would help further to understand the plots.  If you are not familiar with the same, making a portray through this book may not be a good idea.  The book is not free of factual incorrectness.  When compared to the other book (Sea of Poppies by Amitav Ghosh, published around the same time), the research undertaken to write this book appeared to be minuscule.  The book would look a lot different, and probably better, if it was enriched with sufficient research.<br /><br />Like many Booker prize winning books in the past, this one also offered a smooth, good reading experience.write this book appeared to be minuscule.

B00E978FGQ|1.0|This movie was spectacularly bad.  It was a spectacle, and really bad.  First of all, let me guess, the only reason you are watching is because Mr. Facebook is in the movie?  All the known actors probably filmed their parts in 3 or 4 days, because they are hardly in the movie.  That's some real Hollywood magic.  Nothing made sense.  The magicians were basically God, completely infallible, perfect in every way. Unrelated to the aforementioned God comparison, they weren't around as much as we'd like either.  Insult to injury, they were horrendously developed as characters.  We didn't really ever meet them.  So when they pulled off something great (which was completely impossible by the way) I didn't care.  It was like a pitbull versus a grasshopper, surprise surprise the pitbull wins!!  Who cares though??  Do not watch this.  If you do you deserve to get an STD.

B0036S4B6M|4.0|This is different from the Netflix series, so if you have seen the series - fear not! The book still has some entertaining surprises.  I enjoyed the read quite a bit.  It's cool to be able to read about that experience.
B0064Z62R0|5.0|If you like hawaiian music,  you will love this. I have always been a fan of it and these really is lovely.
B00AX6KMGS|5.0|This was a great little movie that starred everyone who wasn't anyone at the time. Would see it again. Worth watching.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|downloaded to kindle fire and nothing works.  you can press all over the screen and nothing happens.  love solve the mystery games but this was a waste of time.  will learn to trust other reviews when they say they just don't. work.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|It was a great follow up to War of the worlds. it was a look at histor . Through some well developed characters. Very long though so I am taking a break before heading into the third book.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|a must have for anyone that likes Mumford and Sons.  We personally like every song on the CD.  Must have to add to your collection.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is  entertaining it's also challenging  for 3 levels I had to get help from friends. If you rate this you should give this 5 stars. I can't wait until they put more levels on this game. I hope you like my review.bye$$$$$$
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Just what I needed for charging a kindle keyboard up & downloading books from the internet ! Fast Service ! Perfect !
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Explains the mishmash of the NT.  With all the literature over thousands of years,  here's a new explanation that makes sense.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this series!!!! Love love love the characters and story line!!!! If you liked Fiffy Shades you'll love this!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|It's a good way to kill some time plus its got upgradeables without any purchases kinda hard for smaller kids some of the objects are small and hard to see
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This book stars John Corey at his irreverent best. At times the plot was slow moving but it did give a sense of all the players and allowed one to understand the characters and their motivations. As a result, the characters came alive. On the whole, the book was a worthy read and I highly recommend  it.
B00844PIRO|5.0|Upon finishing this classic I was left with a sense of sadness, like an old friend had moved far away. I will most definitely pick it up for a reread just to say hello again.
B00821OX98|3.0|Nice premise and decent acting, but there were just too many holes in the plot line - like how the aliens are so intent on killing or capturing all humans, and yet multiple 200+ groups walking through the countryside like a parade in daylight in full view of the alien ship hovering over Boston all went undetected and unseen. OK, must be those invisibility cloaks - no, wait, that's Harry Potter!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Although this game is intended for young girls I find it a calming, undemanding game for horse lovers.<br /><br />Cons: It occasionally will cause Kindle to freeze and you have to restart your Kindle. There are frequent breaks to advertise other games, but just be patient for 15 seconds and you're back in play. It's just like commercials on tv. Finally, you must spend real money to progress quickly through the game. But if you're patient you can get along fine for a long time without spending money.<br /><br />Pros: beautiful graphics and realistic horse movement. Can own several horses at once and the horses don't die if you forget about them for awhile! It's impossible to lose the game..  it's intended to make you play endlessly and entice you to buy stuff. If you have some self control you can enjoy hanging out with your horse and not waste anything more than time.
0143035711|5.0|Excellent and outstanding book--but the final chapters saddened me by the toll it takes on the veterans of all wars.
B001N3GUIE|5.0|To put this in as a &#34;cult classic&#34; sci film would be an understatement! It definitley has everything an old SciFi 1950's film has: cheesy dialogues/a beautiful woman/ great and simple special effects/monsters...you name it! Thanks Amazon for this great deal
1603420398|3.0|I will use it but I guess I expected more in the way of ideas for using the different shapes.
B00BH0VSM6|3.0|This is a good book to read so that you get to know Harry, Nesbo's flawed detective, but later works will keep you up reading late into the night....
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|Wish I could give it more than 5 stars! Great story line and the plot always kept you thinking! Amazing overall!
B00A11AN6O|5.0|It's great I love it I have an iPhone 4 8gb which isn't alot of space so having this allows me to have space on my phone and still have my pictures
B009WUAK2M|5.0|Having viewed the first expecting a cheesy action flick, and viewing instead a flick with an attempt at a plot, I sorely hoped that this sequel would drop all pretenses at an engaging synopsis and simply accentuate that which they perform best: mindless action.<br /><br />Do not expect any thought-provoking dialogue, intriguing characters, or realistic interaction between anyone.  This is not a \\"film,\\" but a cheesy, campy B-movie, so I ask that no one start watching it as anything but that, lol.  Else you will be terribly, terribly disappointed.<br /><br />If you don't want to think too hard and simply want something funny and ridiculous to laugh at, \\"Expendables 2\\" is a good relief relative to all the serious stuff that comes out of Hollywood.  This movie doesn't aim to please everyone in any mood, but what it sets out to do is clear, blatantly obvious even, and it does so (I wouldn't say \\"masterfully,\\" but...) entertainingly. :-)
140006922X|5.0|This book describes the culture and times when Jesus was living in a better way for me. it made Jesus seem more real, as a man. The fact that the author is a Muslim did not bother me.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|It downloading & then kept saying wait or not ok. I kept saying wait for 15 minutes & still nothing happened & I said ok next time the page with wait or not came up. What a waste of my time!!!!!!!!!!!
B00EVN2D3O|5.0|I recommend watching it to anyone.  It is more than worth the time and the money.  I hate spoilers, so that is all I'll say.
0316228583|5.0|J.K. Rowling writes great characters, she demonstrates diversity, humor, education, and drama. I was very entertained throughout. She is a smart writer.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Building your own city is an awsome idea! I would highly reccomend this game to anyone that like to be creative.
B009MO5G90|4.0|My taste in movies run the full gambit depending on my mood. I'll tell you how I judge a movie. Did I enjoy it, and how many times did I look at my watch. Well, let me tell you,I really enjoyed this one and for me the time just flew by. Is it on a scale of one like Into The Darkness , of course not but in my opinion ,it was the life of the party. The action just kept coming and some of the 3-D effects were just super. So, when all is said and done I can see that I will be watching it more than some movies that I own .I am glad I included this one in my collection .
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game. Mind stimulating &amp; lots of fun of you like a challenge. There are no instructions...you have to figure it out. Pretty cool and definitely worth downloading. Glad I did.
B00640UICA|3.0|It's pretty good I think for a free game most free ones are not that interesting and the little goblins are cute
B001OMJGD0|5.0|Since childhood I have always been a fan of Superman.  I used to have just about every comic written about him.  This is one of the better Superman movies in my opinion despite what some critics may say.
B007V2UGPE|1.0|The game was horrible! Did I really just download that and waste my time. I do NOT recommend. Sorry, but needs some improvements. Maybe better moves and theme. Will not be back
B009LMTDL0|3.0|Mostly common sense, a few too many personal anectodes for me. Sites ample research, but not sure Sandberg carries enough cred for me to be motivated by her own stories.
B001X0ZKM4|4.0|I remember seeing this when I was little this was a great movie micheal Keaton did an amazing job! I would recommend people to watch it if u haven't!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I gave this game a 5 star rating. It is so much fun to play with the Star Wars theme. I sometimes have trouble sleeping. Now I love<br />to see how fast I can finish the game. Plus how each level uses part of the movie saga to take the game further into the genre of<br />the original Star Wars. Now you should know I use to feel stress trying to play &#34;Pac Man&#34;. Big change. I love my Kindle Fire HD. I<br />call him Baby Einstein. He has brought me so much happiness. I no longer have to get in my wheel chair & leave the room, so my husband of 46 years can get a good nights sleep, I spend the nights beside him & play games & travel until I fall asleep. A BIG Thanks to my husband for buying B.E. for me and an even BIGGER Thanks to Amazon for making Baby Einstein. I think I just reviewed three 5 star items. Star Wars- Angry Birds, My Kindle Fire HD and Amazon. (The review on my husband is personal, X<br />rated & very private, plus Infinity & beyond!). Also, I so hope we make it until at least 50yrs. Thanks Guys, Catbrogan
B001I45UFC|5.0|Soooooo many references of what life is really about comes alive in this awesome C.S.Lewis book.  It's a must read with a young child. My son couldn't believe it...the ending. It made us smile and share a look of amazement.  When you read about Aslan, you will instantly feel a kindred connection like you've met him before but not remember where. After all, this is just a story, right?
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is the 2nd best game ever it is also it is fun I think you viewers will like it to so check it out
B000SEFNMS|4.0|The book had some cool points to it, but it was very sad and dragged in dome parts, and the order of events was kind of confusing
B00AEBB8YW|5.0|I enjoyed watching the interaction between brothers the staff and the family.<br />Most of all , the tenderness showed to and within the characters.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|For a free game it's not bad. I'm enjoying it more than the classic. This is the kind of game
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great I love the game. It's totally worth the seven bucks. I'd pay 15 bucks for this game. It's like your in real life.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Great thinking game,you really have to look hard for the items. The helpful hints are nice to have. Just started playing, and so far it a great game.
B00E0MCYPS|3.0|it has a great concept but the controls need help so fix that and its great........<br />so yea<br />fix it plz
B00ESNE696|5.0|I like the good wife. The fact that I can watch it with prime makes it even sweeter. The actors are well chosen for their parts.
0978606310|5.0|I bought this because my toddler is in a My Little Pony phase, and it brought back memories of my own childhood toys of My Little Pony.  I'm not a collector, I don't even watch the show (but then, neither does my daughter), and yet, I found this book wonderful!  Brought back a lot of memories about my favorite toy (I had the rainbow haired earth pony), and I'm glad that my daughter is enjoying this toy now.  I appreciate the full-color photos and the index of all accessories (it's in the front, so as not to detract from the pony itself).  The playsets and other toys that are part of the MLP world are also listed, some of them I've never even HEARD of.  Wonderful resource (a friend of mine who still has the Dream Castle from the '80's was interested in borrowing this) for the collector, or just for the person who, like me, is remembering childhood moments.  Highly recommended!
B00E0MCYPS|5.0|I love this game as I am a huge racing fan. It gives you the opportunity to see what it is like behind the wheels of a race car. I really like the camera views. It's only a game but the visuals are super cool. Take your time to learn it and you will have a blast. It is one of the best racing games I've got for my Kindle fire HD so far. Enjoy everyone.
B003QS9VYE|4.0|Good movie for small kids of less than 5 year age. It has engaged my son well and he loves it.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|The book was wonderful.  Would have given it 5 starts except that it seemed the author rushed the ending.  Needed better closure.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|I ENJOYED THIS MOVIE VERY MUCH AND EVERY TIME I SEE IT, I WISH THERE WERE MORE PEOPLE LIKE THIS FAMILY, WHO TOOK THIS CHILD INTO THEIR HOME WITHOUT ANY RESERVATIONS, SHOWED HIM THE LOVE HE CRAVED AND GAVE HIM THE LOVE AND THE SAFETY NET HE NEEDED TO BECOME A GREAT YOUNG MAN.  SANDRA YOU WERE GREAT!!
0545265355|5.0|These are the first books I have read in years.  I am over 65, and I loved every chapter of each book.  What an imagination<br />Suzanne Collins has!!  I read all three books in three days.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My horse is such a fun game it teaches you how to take care of a horse and not to mention that it is free!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I am a game lover and with this game I don't have to wait on someone else to play, yet I have to wait on my brain! Can't wait for the next level.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Suspensful and intriging.  Fun  to watch.  Highly Recommend this.  Why are the BBS shows so much better then American Primetime networks?
B0006HBZXS|5.0|I was &#34;on the edge&#34; watching this great suspenseful movie.  A good pairing of actors with a great story line.  This is another reason you will not catch me in an airplane.
B00E0S52K6|5.0|One of the best albums ive heard in a long time. The legendary Buddy Guy continues his legacy with this great blend of music and story telling
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I've been playing for years...and this game still holds my interest!<br />I play on my pc, phone and kindle.<br />Oh..and I still havent beat all the rooms but I keep trying!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I enjoyed this book entirely just the same way I did in the first two books.  It's an extremely action packed book with specific conflicts which cause extreme consequences, those which would never happen in real life.  Can't wait to see the movie!
B000R4SMCW|5.0|Another good work of this fine actor.  Ryan Gosling wins in the end, but he almost missed the opportunity.  Very suspenseful.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|very boring and not at all like fscott fitzgerald i relly caan't say too much more to try to fill screen with garish scenes was boring
0399160450|5.0|Another awesome Clancy effort. Just gets better and better! Can't wait for the next one. He is the master of his craft.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Works well most of the time . But sometimes I have a problem forwarding or copying and pasting  messages to others
