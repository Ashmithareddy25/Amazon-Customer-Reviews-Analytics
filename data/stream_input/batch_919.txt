B000GCFO0I|3.0|Silent Hill is one of the most visually stunning films I've seen. It is simply mesmerising to look at. The atmosphere is wonderfully dark, dingy, weird and creepy. A dreamlike (or more accurately a nightmare-like) serenity shrouds the deserted town, while just below the surface a terrible darkness lurks. The monsters encountered are truly disturbing, especially the Janitor, and the design of these creatures demonstrates the high level of creativity that has been lavished on the visuals. The effects are top-notch; you will never look at peeling paint in the same way again. Five stars so far, then, no question about it. So it's a real shame that the script lets the production design down. Up until the third act the mystery surrounding the disappearance of the little girl is deeply satisfying in its spookiness. Silent Hill is such a strange place you want the reason for all this suffering and evil to be equally unexpected and bizarre. Instead we learn, during a very long piece of exposition, that the town's terrible past is in fact a rather predictable, and disappointing one. Suddenly the eerie atmosphere is destroyed and the film becomes derivative. Even the spectacular finale can't recapture the mystery that the first two-thirds of the film so effectively created. Anyone who enjoys the work of David Lynch will know that weirdness can be used to great effect and doesn't always have to be completely explained away. If Silent Hill had left more to the imagination of the viewer it would have been a much better movie.

B000GFLKF8|3.0|The really good thing about Spike Lee's \\"Inside Man\\" is the ensemble of brilliant actors. Denzel Washington is a detective who has an odd choice of fashion and an issue with marriage. Clive Owen is the head of a team of robbers who has something else in mind other than money. Jodie Foster is an antagonistic broker who can easily talk down her victims. Christopher Plummer is the Chairman of the Board of Directors who is willing to keep a secret that's hidden in his own bank. Chiwetel Ejiofor is Denzel's partner in crime who is always willing to be a part of the action. These and many other actors give spectacular performances.<br /><br />But as the film features a great ensemble of actors, the film itself fails to impress. Aside from the shockingly powerful conflicts involving racism and corruption, the plot involving the heist and the overthrow of a government official is something that's already been seen before. If you've seen \\"Dog Day Afternoon\\" or have read Nelson DeMille's \\"Cathedral,\\" then you'll notice that the story in \\"Inside Man\\" is nothing really special. Another problem with this film is the uneven third act. With all the hell that's been going on in the last two acts, this final segment contains a much slower pace, which really becomes very tiresome when the last few minutes of the film finally approaches. And speaking of the ending, the last fifteen minutes features two twist endings. But somehow they weren't very shocking. I said to myself, \\"that was unexpected,\\" but at the same time I said, \\"but why don't I feel as shocked as I'm supposed to be?\\" I guess I've seen too many twist endings in recent movies that are kind of like these two, and maybe that's why I'm not surprised at all. But I do believe that the biggest problem with this film is that the jumpy timeline. Once we're in the middle of the bank heist, we start to see some brief scenes that are set in an interrogation room (I won't spoil it for you by telling you exactly which people are inside it). This really spoils the tension and the atmosphere as we already seem to know how this will all end.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. Spike Lee is an intelligent director, and all of the actors give great performances that no doubt stick out in this movie. However, the script and the overall climax and resolution don't really work. I still prefer the film \\"Dog Day Afternoon\\" (bank heist) and the novel \\"Cathedral\\" (political corruption and hostage situation).his really spoils the tension and the atmosphere as we already seem to know how this will all end.

1416955070|2.0|City of Bones is a book about demons and shadow hunters. It has vampires, warlocks, werewolves, fairies, and any other mythical creature. The main character includes a fifteen year old girl named Clary. Whose mother has held a secret from her, her whole life and she doesn't discover till she meets Jace. Jace is a shadow hunter and he hunts demons. One night while clary is at a party she sees jace, Alec, and Isabella about to kill a boy in her eyes, which she later learns is a demon. A few days later her mom is kidnapped and Clary is almost killed by a demon then they take her to the institute. The institute is place were shadow hunters can stay while passing through town. When she goes there she soon discovers she is a shadow hunter and then goes on a journey to fine her mom. While coming encounters while finding out whom she really is.<br /><br />City of bones was a decent book. It's written more for a younger crowd. The main problem I had with this book is it is very similar to twilight but there's a different twist in the plot. Either way it's a cheesy love novel. If you like twilight you will either love this book and Jace will become your new Edward, or you'll hate it because you'll think it's a knock off. For me the book had such a SLOW start. Plus the editing was TERRIBLE! I'm a very visual reader and she would change the descriptions of the characters in certain parts which would drive me insane. Not to mention the book has a very childish story plot.

B000002KBH|5.0|American Beauty being Grateful Dead's 5th studio album and their 1970 album is verily an amazing record with great lyrics to go. Allmusic and Robert Chritgau both gave it high marks (5/5 and A-) and I agree with this assessment. The booklet is unfortunately very sparse and contains no lyrics but one does get a list of what instruments they play on the album. We also get liner notes that talk about history of the Grateful Dead up to that point. 5/5.
B001E75QGG|2.0|George Lucas and Steven Spielberg's overdue, overbaked, and overhyped entry into their treasure hunting series, starring Harrison Ford maintaining all of his rugged charm, has the potential to be at least as fun as [[ASIN:B0014Z4ON4 Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]] if expectations are checked at the door. A convoluted story is built around an alien crystal skull that is fabled to unlock ultimate knowledge, which Indiana Jones is coerced into finding by Cate Blanchett and her Russian comrades. Although Indy is prone to feats that reach out of the realm of realism, implausable stunts involving vineswinging with computer-generated monkeys and being bombed inside a refridgerator seems out of place, as much of the appeal of the first three films was derived from the authentic B-movie style of filmmaking. But Spielberg's approach to directing action can still recall the fun of the originals - in the opening warehouse sequence and the chase through Connecticut in particular. It's ashame Crystal Skull didn't contain more of this content, as much of it is talky and inconsequential. Delightfully, Karen Allen comes back after 27 years, and Shia Labeouf adds a youthful energy amoung a cast skewing older.    Spielberg isn't in the practice of providing audio commentaries for his films on DVD or Blu-Ray, but the insightful making-of documentaries on these discs thoroughly monitor all the phases of production with several interviews with cast and crew.

B002KQ6BT6|2.0|I'm not sure if I'm in a minority or not, but is it so much to ask that writers be expected to adhere to certain standards before being published? As a freelance writer myself (and an editor during my day job), it's my task to make sure my writing is of a literate and technically correct quality before I send it out to grace the public's ears and eyes. As an avid reader, I cross genres quite often, and lately I've been noticing that more and more so-called \\"popular fiction\\" books are written so poorly that even a high school student could pick out the flaws.    \\"The Lost Symbol\\" is definitely one of these books. While it did keep me turning pages, the distractions from the abysmally-constructed plot and grammatical problems were completely insurmountable. Really, how many times did characters wink or chuckle? Does anyone do these things anymore? Adverbs anyone? Lots and lots of adverbs? And one of the central tenets of good fiction, \\"show, don't tell\\" totally ignored?     By the time I finished the book (amidst a lot of eye-rolling and groaning), I was both awed and angry. The awe stemmed from my admiration at the sheer amount of information contained within the book. One reviewer here stated that he felt like he was reading Wikipedia, and I completely agree. This book will probably do more to boost tourism in Washington D.C. then any amount of promotional dollars could ever accomplish. The anger was prompted by the book's ending. Are you kidding me? That's it? That's the payoff for reading through chuckles and winks, stereotypical characters, a bumbling protagonist, a slew of idiotic plot twists, and more mini-cliffhangers-that-weren't-really-cliffhangers than you could shake a stick at?    One of the indications, for me, that I am impressed with a book is the number of times I read it. We have a huge library here at home and many of the volumes have been read by me more than once (in some cases, several times). I do own a copy of \\"The DaVinci Code\\", but it has been read only once. [...]    [...] Jonathan Barnes' \\"Domino Men\\" and Joe Hill's \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" are two examples of superb thrillers I can think of off the top of my head that are far more deserving of the attention Dan Brown is getting for \\"The Lost Symbol\\".    With all this being said, I'm part of the problem too. I purchased this book and wasted a week of my life reading it. But I can hopefully make better choices in the future. In the meantime, I'll go chuckle and wink at someone and see if they look at me like I'm a lunatic.
0385504225|5.0|See all book summaries above.<br />As a big thriller reader and one of Dan Brown's biggest fans I was more than happy with this go round. It has everything a Dan Brown fan comes to expect. A well researched look into history and the sciences. The way these are layed out in novel form is one of Brown's talents. You may not agree with everything he writes, and I think some people will give it a bad review because of this, but he can enthrall me like few authors can.<br /> With mysteries from the past to the present, Dan Brown fans will not be disappointed. Top notch entertainment and enlightenment all the way.<br /><br />From inside:<br />\\"Nothing is hidden that will not be made known; nothing is secret that will not come to light.\\"

B001B1R1HC|4.0|EMI recorded some great Richter early on - the performances included in this \\"Icon\\" set of Schumann's second piano sonata, \\"Papillions\\" and \\"Faschingsswank aus Vien,\\" for example, are unparalleled. I'm very familiar with these recordings which originally appeared on an Angel LP, \\"Richter in Italy,\\" which was among the first Richter albums in my music library in the early 1970's. The Schubert sonata D664, \\"Wanderer\\" Fantasy, Beethoven \\"Tempest\\" sonata, and Schumann Fantasy all came from the same 1961-63 period which were golden years for Richter. Listening again after an interval of many years to Richter's traversal of the \\"Wanderer\\" Fantasy left me in awe - this is pianism that is truly staggering and represents the best of this great artist. The rest of this Icon set, however, isn't always as inspired as this early material; but that's asking for the impossible given that these recordings span eighteen years (1962-1980).<br /><br />There's a good remake of Prokofiev's Fifth concerto, although it doesn't equal Richter's legendary recording with Rowicki issued on DG, and a tremendous Bartok Second with Lorin Maazel - a stunning effort that's among the very best of Richter's concerto recordings. There's also a remake of Beethoven's Third concerto that's an improvement over the earlier effort with Sanderling, also on DG - but that's not saying too much given the weakness of the matchup with Sanderling. The Schumann concerto here is also a remake, but it's outstanding despite flimsy support from the Orchestre National de l'Opera de Monte Carlo. The Grieg concerto, from the same sessions as the Schumann, is typical Richter, which is to say that there are exaggerations here and there that lead one to wonder if Richter's goal was simply to be different. Certainly he had his own ideas about a piece and although they may not necessarily have been the same as the composer's, they sometimes worked. And sometimes they didn't as is the case with the Mozart concerto K482, which receives a modernist, almost modal treatment, which is fascinating in its own way but isn't good Mozart. This performance, along with the Mozart K466 concerto which Richter made in 1959 with Rowicki, led me to conclude that the pianist just wasn't well suited to Mozart. The Mozart violin sonatas with Kagan, however, are very good; despite being a powerful soloist, Richter was an excellent chamber musician. The Beethoven violin sonatas no. 4 & 5, also with Kagan, are nicely done; but Schubert's \\"Trout\\" Quintet performed with the Borodin Quartet is superficial-sounding.<br /><br />Also on the plus side are two excellent Beethoven sonatas from 1976, op. 2 no 1, and op. 10 no. 3. Even though Richter's Beethoven sonatas, just like practically anything from him, could be unorthodox, I find them very imaginative. As an aside, I always loved the four sonatas he recorded for Philips in the mid-sixties (nos. 10, 11, 19, & 20). These are real gems and all of them, except no. 11, have been reissued (rather oddly) as disc-mates to Richter's legendary recordings of the Liszt concertos. It would have been nice to see all four of these sonatas issued on one disc, especially since Philips had already coupled the Liszt concertos with the Liszt sonata. Such are the ways of record companies.... In any event, let's hope that we'll see a reasonably priced box set of Richter's Philips recordings sometime in the not too distant future given that Universal Music Group, which owns the Philips, Decca and DG labels, already did this for his DG recordings (see [[ASIN:B001V7R09A Pianist of the Century ~ Sviatoslav Richter]]).<br /><br />Other reviewers have touched on other details, including the sound which I find to be variable, and that's putting it charitably. Nothing is outright bad, it's just that much of it is hard and thin, which I don't think has anything to do with the remastering but instead with the original tapes. Just listen to Richter's earlier DGG studio recordings issued in the Pianist of the Century box set and you'll find that DG was way ahead of EMI.<br /><br />When all is said and done, I don't find Richter's EMI repertoire as interesting as the material that has appeared on other labels, but this is a situation one accepts with a retrospective of this nature. And since most of the recordings in this fourteen cd set are still available individually, I wondered if I would have been better off just buying the discs I wanted. After considering the options, I bought a set for under $50 through an Amazon reseller that shipped from the UK - as it turns out, a bargain at about $3.50 a disc even though, for example, I'm never going to listen to Richter and Fischer-Dieskau performing Brahms' \\"Die schone Magelone.\\"<br /><br />Despite some reservations, this is a set well worth having.

0385504225|1.0|I was so excited to find this book at Costco for around [...]. the first day it came out.  I settled down after lunch in my comfortable chair with a fresh cup of coffee and the book.  A couple of hours later I realized that this book is just tiresome to wade through. I doubt I'll even finish it.  Maybe part of rating it one star is the disappointment I felt when I realized was just not a good book.    It is much too long, I'm about half way through and am all impressed with Dan Brown's intelligence but not his ability to still write an great book. I think Dan Brown saw info on Noetics and decided it would make a great part of a plot for a book.  Guess what, it didn't.    I've enjoyed 3 of Dan Brown's other books but this one is a total dud.     If you feel you must read it, check it out from the library or wait for the paperback.  I'll bet in a week or so second hand book stores will have lots of the hardback.
0439023491|3.0|The concept of the Hunger Games was so fresh and the plotting handled so well that it packed an unforgettable punch.  I waited eagerly for this sequel, but although still a good read, it doesn't measure up.<br /><br />The first part, showing Katniss and Peeta's life after the games, as the Capitol becomes more obviously cruel and oppressive in the face of possible uprising, builds suspense.  Will Katniss try to escape, join the rebellion, or continue to follow the President's orders?  Does District 13 exist?  And of course, will Katniss choose Peeta or Gale?<br /><br />But then, in a strained plot turn, the new games require past champions to play.  So we go over the same ground again.  This time the freshness of the preparation scenes, the clothes, make up, the marketing of the players etc., is lost, and we rush to the arena where the deaths begin.  The game is gripping, but we've been there before.  I actually found some of the description of the arena hard to follow, or maybe I didn't care, since it was obvious there would be no real resolution until Book III.  The adolescent qualities of this book were also more annoying than the first one:  the fixation on clothes and hair, the dithering over which boy, etc.  This is perhaps unfair criticism of a YA novel, but there's so much in this series that lifts it above teenage romance that it's disappointing to see it lapse into that genre.<br /><br />Still I'd recommend anyone who liked the Hunger Games to read this book, and I will be waiting for the third one, eager for an exciting satisfying conclusion!

So, being a wise woman, I wanted to \\"waste not - want not\\" so I played it and became infatuated with Coraline. That's when I began a frantic search for the movie online - you know - hulu, etc. Nothing was watchable.<br />So, when it came out on DVD my computer automatically sent me to Amazon and when it arrived I almost couldn't wait until the two grands we're raising and my hubby came home that evening.<br />It was wonderful! It's best to watch in a very dark room.

0439023491|5.0|Before I picked up my copy of Catching Fire, I read a review in Entertainment Weekly and was disapointed when I saw the reviewer had given it a C+. As you can see by my 5 stars I would have given it an A-.<br />The reviewer sited this book was slow in the 1st half, followed by action in the 2nd half. That the improbable technology and unoriginal tactics and creatures in the Arena were simply copied from the 1st book.<br />This is not so, in fact I would say this reviewer was very biased for some reason. Granted there was a lot of hype surrounding Hunger Games, so it was almost a given there would be a sophmore slump.<br />If there is a slump it is miniscule, I inhaled this book and was just as enthralled in it as I was H.G. as is everyone else I have talked to.<br />No the 1st half of the book doesn't have a lot of action, but it does paint more of Panem's districts (though I wish there'd been more), Katniss is in danger regularly, as are her friends & family, and there is plenty of plenty of political intrigue.<br />As for the Arena I wouldn't say that what went on was any more improbably than what went on in Hunger Games.
0385504225|5.0|After reading a few of the reviews that were highlighted on the page for this book I decided to write a review of my own.  I AM a Dan Brown fan and have read all of his books.  The DiVinci Code was first, then Angels and Demons.  Next was Deception Point and Digital Fortress. I felt the first two were great reads, I couldn't put them down.  The second two (Deception Point and Digital Fortress) were more difficult to pick up and read although I did finish them both.  So when \\"The Lost Symbol\\" was coming out I was not sure which category it would fall into.<br /><br />Having received a Kindle DX from my beloved husband for my birthday (thank you sweetie) I was happy that I could download a \\"sample\\" of The Lost Symbol before buying it.  I was hooked after the 4th chapter and immediately pressed \\"buy\\" when I reached the end of the sample.<br /><br />I feel that Dan Browns characters were portrayed well and his writing was amazing. It kept me on the edge of my seat for the entire book.  The twists and turns that the book takes kept me guessing throughout the entire book.  I was battling a pretty vicious cold during most of the reading of the book and didn't want to rest, I wanted to read the book.  I'm sad that the story is over and wish there were more to read.  I do not feel that the writing was sophomoric at all, I feel Mr. Brown put enough detail into the text to ensure that the reader was fully aware of what was happening and could imagine it in their mind.  Would I like to see this made into a movie?  Most definitely!<br /><br />For those who like a page turner with lots of twists and turns, this is a wonderful example. I rank it up there with DiVinci Code and Angels and Demons.
B00275EHCI|2.0|(The movie is based on a comic book of the same name. Since I have not read it, I am reviewing the film as a stand alone work)<br /><br />In a not so distant future, 98% of Earth's population are using human made robots as their avatars in the real world. From their comfy homes, reclining in their comfy chairs, clad in their uber ugly pajamas, the \\"meat bags\\" (as the \\"real\\" humans are affectionately referred to) control, as well as feel, their surrogates' every move and action. They work, live, make love and war as taller, prettier, shinier versions of themselves. It is therefore surprising, that FBI Agent Greer would choose, of all available options, to have his avatar look like the aging Bruce Willis with a bad toupee... But... we willingly suspend our disbelief and pretend we do not notice... a trick that comes in handy on many more occasions during this short flick, but one that becomes more and more difficult to perform as we grow increasingly annoyed with the appearance of yet another plot hole.<br /><br />The son of the genius behind the surrogate program is murdered. It is likely the genius himself, Lionel Canter (James Cromwell), was the intended victim. No one seems to remember when the last murder actually took place. Somehow, the writers want us to believe that the use of surrogates has put an end to murder... Well, not logical, but enter another suspension of disbelief. During the course of their investigation, Greer and his partner Agent Peters (the lovely Radha Mitchell whom we first saw as Fry in Pitch Black) discover the existence of a weapon that can kill not only a surrogate, but also its human owner. It is a threat to the entire civilization. Mayhem ensues as Agent Greer the \\"meat bag\\" must abandon his comfy chair and his ratty pj's to re-join the real world in order to save us all.<br /><br />The film's message is interesting and thought provoking. It is conceivable that in a couple of decades we will be able to send avatars into war and control them with only our thoughts. How far will we take this technology? The danger has always existed that, in our never-ending quest to subjugate the Earth, we would take it too far and lose our humanity in the process... This message however is not new and has been presented in far more entertaining packages. Surrogates is not a bad film. If it were a made-for-TV, or a direct-to-DVD, I would be impressed. Given however, that this is a theatrical release with a predictable, yet swiss cheese plot, conventional CGI, and a second hand philosophy, I just cannot find reasons to rave about it. Even the acting does not inspire. Despite some great talents present (I could never forget how brilliantly creepy Cromwell was in L.A. Confidential), the underdeveloped script thwarts any attempts at talent display. If you have a couple of hours to spare, sure, it will not hurt to see Surrogates. But, if you do not, you will not miss anything. Again, it's been done already, only better.<br /><br />BTW: Interesting that the makers refused to do movie critic screenings.

0385504225|2.0|After all these years of waiting for the \\"new\\" Dan Brown book Mr. Brown has published a throwaway, a money maker, a huge disappointment.  Where The Da Vinci Code was a good story bringing to popular fiction a story that has been known for over 200 years, his new book is just your average chase book. There is no \\"Lost Symbol\\".  We have read these so many times, Robert Ludlum perfected this type of chase and wrote some good stories around it.<br />This new book is for the most part boring.  There are no new revelations being brought to light.  In the end we are very disappointed.  Also, I feel I got sucked in by the promise of something terrific.  Normally, I would give a book like this 50-75 pages and then I'd put it down forever.<br />This is a poorly written book with a not very interesting story.  Much of what he asks us to believe about the bad guy is just dribble..crap.  So poorly written that I looked forward to his being only a tiny part of the book instead of the huge portion of the book Brown assigns him.<br />Do not waste your time on this book.

B002IVLH60|5.0|I questioned this cd a lot and I think I listened to it the first time hypercritical. After 3+ listens I really feel that this is gem. I've gotten tired of the constant political material that bands are putting out these days, especially Pearl Jam, so it is really refreshing for them to put out something that is as heartfelt as the songs on this cd. This cd feels a lot like Riot Act but more to the point. Favorites: Unthought Known, Amongst the Waves, The End, and The Fixer.

So I pulled the second one out of the box and now I have 2 Batteries.<br /><br />So it lasted about 3 or more years and I use it several times a week. It got A LOT OF USE!  It could be it didn't last longer because I always tried putting off the un-cloging the turn brushes for as long as I could - and then longer then I should have I am sure.<br /><br />I really believe I probably contributed to the slowly burning out the motor myself.

B00004YW6I|4.0|Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea  being Harvey's 2000 release and was her second major commercial success since her 3rd album To Bring you My Love. The sound is a mixture of indie and alternative rock and has a very rough edge to the lyrics and the sound. Harvey writes intersting and thought worthy lyrics that makes you cling to ever word she sings. The booklet has a very strange photograph on the front. The album was met very positive reviews when it was released and Q, Robert Christgau and Allmusic all gave it high marks. 4/5.
068817776X|5.0|This book is one of my all time favorites.  It was hard to put down.  Her writing is vivid, real, and makes you feel as if you are there with her.  I have read it twice.  Her experience was different from many who suffered in the camps during this time.  She had to be witty, prepared at all times, and every day lived with the fear of being found out. She includes lots of photographs from that time period.  I would have a hard time letting this book go. I highly recommend this book for anyone.  You won't be bored!
B00127RAJY|1.0|I was so excited to try out this product. A friend of mine looked fabulous after having her kids and she let me in on her \\"Shred\\" secret. With little time to spare for workouts these days w/ children, I was excited to get quick results in 20 minutes a day. After just 7 sessions, I was unable to walk down a set of stairs without the inside of my knees feeling like they had pins & needles in them. I have NEVER had knee issues and am in good shape (I worked out through my 7th month of pregnancy). I got an orthopedic opinion and it turns out some of the exercises in level 1 (that's as far as I got) are AWFUL for your knees - butt kicks & side (forward) lunges primarily. The over-extension of the knee is awful. During the exercise, I remember thinking, 'this doesn't feel right, but I guess I just need to push through.' Well, if you feel this way, I would warn you to stop!

B002IRYYE6|1.0|If you're thinking of buying the Audio Fidelity version because you believe it won't have any compression, don't because it does.  Despite the marketing claims on the cover there is compression.  The cover states \\"The original dynamic range of this recording was not maximized, brickwalled, limited, or compressed in anyway during remastering.\\"  Just put up Space Invader (as and example) from this release in any garden variety audio editing program and compare it to the 1980's cd version and you'll see that some substantial limiting and compression has be done.<br /><br />Audio Fidelity and Steve Hoffman have really tarnished their image with this one, and the fact that emails to AF have not been answered makes me think they don't care what they're selling.  So if the 'no compression' thing is deceptive, what else about this reissue also is?  Is it from the master tapes?  Personally, I'm not going to buy anymore AF or Hoffman releases because I don't like being lied to and I no longer trust them.<br /><br />BTW, the one star is for the AF release, not the music which is 5 stars all the way.
0439023491|5.0|Catching Fire is not just an amazing sequel to the Hunger Games, but is a truly fabulous book in its own right. The story immediately sucked me in, and did not let up for one moment. The plot is fascinating, the characters are incredibly well developed and the relationships between the characters are realistic and complex. On top of an interesting story, the author delivers a thought provoking tale that makes you really think about the choices that people make and the circumstances that affect our choices. I wholeheartedly recommend this book, and not just for young adults, but for adult readers as well. I simply cannot wait until the third book is published!
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|SPOILER ALERT  Oh please!  They are worried about a VIDEO getting out??  Doesn't Dan watch History Channel?  That's all they show for god's sake!  And I figured out that it was his son after the robbery--poor telegraphing.  Sorry but getting through this was like laying a five pound turd.  DaVinci Code was much better.
B0017VG69U|4.0|I did own the original 2004 release (all three seasons) and had sold them a few years ago.  I was excited to see the release of the standard DVD remastered versions and they do not dissapoint for the most part.  The recreations are very good and fit nicely in to the episodes.  They episodes still have a \\"modern\\" feel, but do retain almost all of the original charm. I think the planet and ship digitizations are right on the mark.  I do have an up converting DVD player and the quality of the remastering most definately is noticed.  Some people have complained about the new theme music and/or the new digital additions, but I have no issues.  I really think EVERY Star Trek fan needs to have these versions.  Also, they are in 1:33 format as the original productions and while some have criticized that as well, I also see no issues.  The Uniforms and all scenes are sharper and the sound is fantastic.  I do have two criticisms that prevent 5 stars.  There is NO english subtitles and MOST OF ALL, there is NO printing of the disks, just left alone with no data except for season and disk information.  It would have been excellent had Paramount/CBS spend a few more cents per disk to print logos, episode information etc.  I did end up printing my own labels, and is the only way to view the episodes on each disk.  This is incredible thatthey were so cheap! But other than that, I am pleased and feel the blank printing is not enough to prevent anybody from buying this set (or the other seasons).
0385504225|3.0|With the Da Vinci Code being incredibly successful, Dan Brown had to wonder how he could match or even top that success. Several years later, here is the result, the Lost Symbol. In this thriller, Robert Langdon spends the night in Washington DC tracking down the century old secrets of the masons and other societies and religions dating back thousands of years.<br /><br />I've read all of Brown's novels, and really enjoyed Digital Forces, Deception Point and Angels and Demons. I started not liking the Davinci Code as I read it and before I reached the \\"startling\\" conclusion. Each chapter ended with Langdon deciphering a code and me wondering \\"how did he get that from that\\" then realizing its fiction so I kept reading.<br /><br />Everyone has heard about the Masons and their supposed secrets as well as the many masonic symbols in American history, such as the pyramid in the dollar bill. This book expounds on those. This book is a clone of the Da Vinci Code except it fails to match up to its predecessor in many areas. First, after reading, I wonder how Brown filled up 500 pages. Langdon does very little code deciphering or symbol interpreting. Second, the bad guy is just one man, and seems to have a lot more power than necessary. Finally, the big secret is<br />a big letdown.<br /><br />I don't know if Brown feels like he has to bash Christianity in his novels or what, but in this one he attacks every religion in a can't we all just get along type conclusion. I'm not going to spoil any of the big secrets, but it really is kind of silly, and the conclusion makes the previous 490 pages kind of meaningless (They were fighting over that!?)<br /><br />While I was critical above, the book did keep my interest and kept me turning the pages. Fans of Brown should read Katherine Neville's The Eight for more code breaking adventures (but avoid its sequel, the Fire).<br /><br />Based on the numbers, this book is a hit. But chances are a lot of people are going to be disappointed and let down. This book just doesn't deliver.iver.
B0002WZTOI|4.0|Okay, I confess.  TOP GUN is a rarity--it's one of the few Tom Cruise films I can tolerate.  (The other two being [[ASIN:B0000YEEGM Rain Man]] and [[ASIN:B001TUZG4U Valkyrie]].)  In fact, I not only tolerate TOP GUN. . .I flat out like the heck out of it, even after all these years.  Yes, the plot is farfetched and silly, no armed services would put up for one nanosecond the antics of an undisciplined pilot, and someone looking like Kelly McGillis as a jet pilot instructor at a naval aviation school will actually happen when herds of elephants swim the Atlantic, but it matters not:  This Eighties classic gets up and moves just like the F-14s bolting through the skies.<br /><br />Cast, cast, cast; that's what makes an action/drama succeed.  And here we have a topnotch ensemble, from Cruise himself as the \\"need for speed\\" Maverick, a loose cannon living on the edge.  McGillis's character as instructor-turned-love-interest is unbelievable, but easy on the eye; Val Kilmer as top rival Ice is cool, calm, collected, and deliciously confrontational; Anthony Edwards as Maverick's cockpit sidekick Goose provides consistent comedy relief; and Tom Skerritt as flight school commander Viper is as good as it gets.  Oh, there's even this little cameo by a young actress named Meg Ryan that quietly hints here's an actress with some chops.  The jet fighter sequences are breathtaking, the action and drama relentless, the acting first rate--and it's all augmented by a sensational musical score.  All in all, TOP GUN is a keeper, Tom Cruise or no Tom Cruise.  Could've done without the beach volleyball scene, but that's just me.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning
1931382794|2.0|I was expecting this book to help me learn about my power meter and it's usage. I read over half of the book before I droped it. This book is for the \\"BIG RACER\\" not for someone that just wants to have fun and ride. From my understanding you need to buy webservice from them and ride for a little while and then spend twice as much time after each ride recording the information. What you eat, what you drank. What you ate and drank the night before and the morning of the ride.    I guess the book is ok and would be worth having if you use their web service. Really seemed more like an instruction manual that should be given away free if you are a paying customer on their website. All charts in the book are from their website which you have to sign up for.
B002IVLH60|4.0|After reconquer their fans and critics in 2006, with the straighforward hard-rock on \\"The Avocado Album\\", Pearl jam are back in 2009 with their 9th album, \\"Backspacer\\".  For a bunch of guys in their mid-forties, Backspacer is, quite frankly, a good record, mostly of the rock songs are up-beat with a positive vibe, and even the melodic and gentle tunes have a message of hope, hidden under sad instrumentation.    Gonna see my friend, Got some, The Fixer, Johnny Guitar and Supersonic are all short punk-rockers with some bits of pop. Got Some is particular interesting, from the new-wave intro, to the speedy chorus, the rhythm section is on fire here. Jeff Ament and Matt Cameron both shine on this one. Great song, a better choice for 1st single, in my opinion.    Amongst the Waves, Unthought Known and Force of Nature sound epic as uplifting mid-tempo songs, perfect for singalongs in concerts. Amongst the Waves is my favourite from the record, its sounds like the result of a crazy mix between \\"Given to fly\\" and \\"I am mine\\" trying to re-create \\"Alive\\"! Great chorus and guitar solo by Mccready. An instant classic.  Just a step below, are Unthought known and Force of Nature, both good tracks, with epic structures, amazing guitar work and vocals by Vedder.    Finally, the moody/laid-back moments of Backspacer appears on Just Breathe, Speed of Sound and The End. Just Breathe is one of the best love song ever written and sung by Eddie Vedder. Its very simple but beautiful. Another highlight.  Speed of Sound is a sad song about loneliness and aging. Good arrangements by the producer Brendan O'brien. The End is a very intimist, touching acoustic piece, with some shy orquestration on the background. Eddie really shines on this one.    The musicianship between band its right on top, but Eddie Vedder is particulary inspired, writing emotional lyrics, and singing like in 1993. But there's an evident lack of guitar solos by Mike Mccready, and clocking at 36minutes, there was enough space for one, or two, maybe three, others songs.    Overall, Backspacer is a good record, with cool packaging, full of catchy songs, and even if its shorter than others Pearl Jam albums, is definitely one of their most acessible, alongside \\"Ten\\" and \\"Vs\\".      My Backspacer Playlist:    1-Gonna See My Friend  2-Got Some  3-Force of Nature  4-Johhny guitar  5-Just Breathe  6-Amongst the Waves  7-Unthought Known  8-The Fixer  9-Speed of Sound  10-SuperSonic  11-The End    My Backspacer rating: 7/10
1416550542|4.0|Kate Morton's mystery/fairy tale is ultimately a satisfying read, with interesting characters and a good, convoluted plot.  As others have noted, the time shifts from the 1910s to the 1970s to the 2000s from chapter to chapter are initially confusing, but as one gets familiar with the characters, these time shifts are less jarring (it is interesting to compare the structure of Iain Pears' Stone's Fall, where each time period was a separate section of the novel [and hence easier to read, in my opinion], with The Forgotten Garden's frequent shifts among time periods).  For mystery buffs, however, the revelation at the book's conclusion was not a surprise to me, and I generally never unravel a mystery.  All in all, a well-written, pleasant combination of a mystery and a morality tale, with a bit of travelogue (Cornwall and Queensland) thrown in for good measure.
0385342020|4.0|Sophie Kinsella is one of my favorite chick lit authors. Twenties Girl is a worthy addition to her body of work. I'm giving the book four stars rather than five because it takes quite some time to really draw you in. However, there are several shining moments, and Twenties Girl is definitely worth reading. It's not Kinsella's best, but it's still very good.
0307269981|5.0|In \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo\\" author Stieg Larsson introduced readers to Lisbeth Salander, a totally fascinating, but mysterious character that had me wanting much more.  \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" is a sequel and I got my wish. A social misfit and damaged personality,  Lisbeth becomes a one-person sword of vengeance and right for abused women while at the same time, a fugitive from false murder charges. This tiny (4'11\\") young woman has a genius level intellect, self-defense and survival skills off the charts, a photographic memory, world-class computer hacking skills, incredible insight, and even becomes quite sexy. At times, she goes over the top into a cartoon-like or action-hero type character, but the book is a lot of fun and a very good story with a great deal of substance. The ending is imaginative and amazing and calls for a movie. The other main character from Girl with the Dragon Tatoo, journalist Mikael Blomkvist, is also back with a large role. I enjoyed him too, but Lisbeth Salander simply steals the show. These books take place in Sweden and the scenes and mores of Swedish society are also fun. It turns out the Lisbeth has a twin sister. Hopefully, we will meet her in another (the final?) installment.

B002IVLH60|4.0|Over the last 18 years Pearl Jam has been the one band from the grunge movement who has shown staying power.  Earlier this year they treated us to the Legacy Edition of Ten (see my review) which renewed the initial spark that they created all those years ago.  Now we have an album of new material to consider in Backspacer.  Expecting Backspacer to live up to Ten or even try to match its sound is both unfair and unrealistic.<br /><br />Backspacer is a CD that doesn't fall nicely into a single category partly because it has as an interesting mix of tempos across all of the songs.  It starts out with two heavily punk influenced tracks - \\"Gonna See My Friend\\" and \\"Got Some\\".  These along with \\"Supersonic\\" made me think of R.E.M.'s last CD Accelerate.  The majority of the songs on Backspacer are just under or just over three minutes long which is another thing it has in common with Accelerate.  However, it is not an Accelerate knockoff by any means.<br /><br />In contrast, \\"The End\\" and \\"Just Breathe\\" are slower songs which include string arrangements (I've noticed this a lot on other CDs this year).  These two along with \\"Speed Of Sound\\" make for a dose of more mellow tunes.  These are definitely different than what you find on Ten on songs such as \\"Deep\\", \\"Garden\\", and \\"Release\\".  While the slower songs on Ten still had a lot of tension from both the instrumentation and the vocal delivery, what you hear on Backspacer has a much more relaxed feel to it.<br /><br />Then there are the mid tempo songs such as \\"Amongst The Waves\\" and \\"Force Of Nature\\" that I found filled with catchy hooks that seem much more radio friendly than the first singles \\"The Fixer\\" and \\"Got Some\\".  These really sucked me in from the first time that I listened to the CD, and I like these more and more with each subsequent listen.<br /><br />Instrumentally, Mike McCreedy turns in some nice work on \\"Got Some\\", \\"Amongst The Waves\\", and \\"Force Of Nature\\"; however, it is not as ubiquitous or as driven as what you find on Ten.  It seems that he has mellowed with age, and that Pearl Jam is exploring a broader range of sound and depth.  In addition to the strings on \\"The End\\" and \\"Just Breathe\\", I also like the piano on \\"Unthought Known\\".  While it is different than what they've done in the past, I think that Pearl Jam has found good sound on Backspacer.<br /><br />There's plenty to like on Backspacer for both old and new fans alike.  You never know what you are going to get from one album to the next, but this time I think that Pearl Jam hit the mark.<br /><br />Download this:  Force Of Natures that he has mellowed with age, and that Pearl Jam is exploring a broader range of sound and depth.

B001BTG3OQ|5.0|I really love this flash! Now with that said you should know that buying cheap batteries and or rechargeable batteries is a no no for wedding photography. You really want to do your battery home work on this flash. I bought some energizer rechargeable batteries and they kicked in the thermal protection after about 10 min of heavy flash use. They work fine for day to day shooting but if your shooting an event buy some good batteries.
0618918248|5.0|What's to fear in this book? Nothing. It's not an attack on faith, but instead, is simply a rigorous scientific refutation of the possibility that there is a God like the one described by the religious powers-that-be to this point in history. If you claim to have faith, but have never challenged your faith, I'd suggest there is no better time than the present, and no better book than this one with which to begin. If you are so devout that the mere premise of this book appears to be the work of the devil, then I'd say, no better place to \\"know the enemy\\" than in these pages. But, in my opinion, Professor Dawkins is the enemy of no one seeking the truth. And, unlike the majority of his detractors, he is not defensive or negative in this book. His well supported attacks on dogma seem to be fueled by an indignation at the well documented, pervasive un-Godly [my term] acts committed across the sweep of history in the name of religion. He addresses many of these historical facts in the book. This is not a book of opinions and impressions. It is basically a good faith effort by one of the world's top scientists to scrutinize accepted, but unjustified, religious truths.     I grew up going to church. It was always a positive experience of community for me. My parents were positive role models of a true faith based in love of humanity. I was confirmed in the (Lutheran) church and mentored youth being confirmed. I don't have religious hangups.    Jesus said in the Bible: \\"The truth will set you free.\\" It would be very hard to argue that Professor Dawkins is not seeking the truth.    A sense of wonder at having been given a life. By whom or what? This book helped me shed that question and begin to look with more wonder at all that is around me.

0385342020|3.0|Lara Lington's life is a mess. First, she quit her job to start a headhunting business with her best friend Natalie and then Natalie up and left for Goa leaving Lara unprepared to deal with business. Next, Lara's boyfriend Josh dumps her, leaving her lonely and desperate. Then Lara's great-aunt Sophie dies. Aunt Sophie was 105 and died alone in a nursing home. Lara's family can barely spare the time to hold a brief funeral for the lady. During the service, Lara hears a voice in her ear which she eventually realizes is great-aunt Sadie's ghost who tells Lara to stop the funeral before her body is cremated! Aunt Sophie's ghost manifests herself as a young woman in her twenties and she is searching for her favorite necklace from the 1920s and won't rest until she finds it. Lara quickly finds herself going crazy trying to help the ghost of Aunt Sadie. As their relationship develops, Sadie helps Lara learn about life, friendship, love and most importantly, family. Lara uncovers some shocking family secrets and helps Sadie achieve her dream and accomplish her goal. with very unappealing characters. Every single conversation and action is written out making for a very long, slow-moving novel until 3/4 of the way through when the mystery really picks up. Then, once the mystery is resolved, the predictable resolution drags on and on. The characters in this book are also not very appealing. Lara is such an annoying sad-sack in the beginning that I just can't like her very much. Sadie is even worse. She's obnoxious and acts like a spoiled child when she doesn't get her own way. I felt sorry for in her old age though and liked her a little better towards the end. I also had issues with the way Lara handled the mystery and the unrealistic way museum staff were portrayed. Fans of Kinsella's quick, witty novels will probably be disappointed in this one.
0385504225|1.0|This book is absolutely terrible for all the same reasons that other readers have identified. It  was somewhat exciting in the beginning but there were many parts I had to skim through that were langdon and solomon spurting off a bunch of BS over and over again with no resolution in the end and no basis in reality whatsoever. One of the WORST BOOKS I have ever read!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|this book is exciting adventurous and a page turner. i definetely recommend it. my advice is to take time to get into the book. it may be slightly boring for some at first but it gets great. two thumbs up to suzanne collins.
0385340575|3.0|OK, it may seem like a small thing, but it drives me nuts that the Jack Reacher character, an American ex-GI, constantly uses words and phrases that only an Englishman would use, or even understand. Lee Child has been selling books in the US for many years. Why doesn't he get himself an American editor to let him know that we would never say...    last-but-one to mean next-to-last  counterpane to mean bedspread  damp squib to mean dud  disused to mean unused    ...and about a hundred others?    More importantly, this book has villains that are as believable as those in an Austin Powers movie. Evil is much scarier when it's a reflection of reality, not a cartoonish fantasy.    Also, this guy and his author are moving very awkwardly into the computer age. He uses a computer for some things, but then spends a day in a bookstore to find out the name of some military department, instead of spending ten seconds on Google. His cell phone works differently than any real cell phone. I don't know anything about guns, but I know a lot about technology. If Childs gets all the stuff I know about wrong, how can I trust the rest?    All told, Reacher is getting old and boring. Soaking the last chapter in blood and gore can't rescue lazy writing.
0141018828|5.0|I couldn't help chuckling and nodding my head continually while reading Marcus' Meditations. His thoughts and life principles can be seen as repetitious through out Meditations (the books within it pretty much cover the same territory over and over, but actually cement his views firmly within your mind)yet they will give you great pause and reflection upon your own life.     I can't think of any better primer for living in today's crazed, money-obsessed, celebrity-driven and unbelievably shallow world. He is a Stoic by definition, of course, but the man really knew the world and Man all too well and he would find no surprise in the opinionated, self-righteous nature of the 21st century. It's a short book, but is best read slowly and savored intellectually.    I couldn't help but feel that all the Tony Robbins, Eckhard Tolles, Wayne Dyers, Deepok Chopras and Dr's Phils of our silly world pale next to his simple, yet solid principles and to some degree their books are derivitive of Aurelius' work. Highly recommended!     I never reread books - there are too many wanting my time, but I will do so with this one. In truth it's a startling honest and insightful book of how to run your life and should be stuck in your backpack or suitcase for those times when you lose your patience with people, grow disillusioned and world-weary, or just want to travel back through time and communicate with a man that actually ran the entire Western World for a while, a man who took never took himself or the trappings of the world all that seriously.
B000N3ST7A|3.0|I'm not a huge fan of Stevie Nick's solo material. I loved her songs in Fleetwood Mac and always thought that she was the real star of that band in terms of songwriting prowess and quality, but her solo material doesn't seem as inspired and lacks the tremendous arranging skills of Lindsey Buckingham. I love some of her hits, but this collection was hit and miss for me. Planets Of The Universe is a welcome surprise inclusion. There's many other highlights but just as many songs that I don't care for. The best songs here are:    Edge Of Seventeen  Stop Draggin' My Heart Around  Talk To Me  Stand Back  Leather And Lace  Planets Of The Universe    Those songs are her very best and worth the price of admission to this cd. The other ones are just not interesting enough for my taste. Casual fans will be pleased to find most of her radio singles here. Long-time fans might want this for either remastered sound or for the 3 rarities present, but likely own all of the material.     The remastering job is first-rate.

B000001EUL|5.0|The scorpions were never the hardest rocking metal band out there but they were certainly one of the best when it comes to melody and catchiness. They might not be the hardest but nevertheless, they rock! This album is a must-have for any serious metal or hard rock fan. Every song is a keeper. Several of them are Scorpions classics and are still played live to this day. This was the transitional album between the changing of the guard of founding lead guitarist Uli Roth and Matthias Jabs. Legendary guitarist Michael Schenker, of UFO and MSG fame helped rhythm guitarist and brother Rudy with lead guitar duties after Uli quit the band, for this album only. Jabs and Rudy did the rest of the lead guitar work.     Every track is a highlight. They even threw in a reggae song in Is There Anybody There? Loving You Sunday Morning, Another Piece Of Meat, Coast to Coast, Lovedrive and Holiday are all classic Scorpions. One of their finest.
B0017YDPI2|1.0|My 1 star rating is for the poor BD trasnfer only, the show itself is Amazing, one of the best out there   right now! And, for that, such a great amazing show deserved a much better transfer.  The picture quality it's just a little bit better than the standard DVD image.  This is an outrage! I'm disappointed!
B00001R3GI|4.0|This album is lauded by critics as the Stones best. I would disagree with that but I can see where that observation comes from. It is definitely the most imaginative and original album that the Stone ever made. It isn't crawling with hits like Let It Bleed or Some Girls, but it has the best flow of any of their albums period. The album is purposely produced to sound like low-fi blues as it is intended as a chronicle of American blues music and the people that surround it. The cover looks like a collage of pictures taken during a trip through rural America where some of the most colloquial and interesting characters to be found there were photographed. The album as a whole pulls the listener into that world and puts you in a special vibe that is hard to describe and that they never captured before or since. I think that they tried the same with Beggar's Banquet but succeeded there to a much lesser degree. Once you absorb the enormous sprawl that is this album it becomes an increasingly enjoyable listen and I would list it as one of my all-time favorite Stones albums. I would rank them as follows.    Let It Bleed  Some Girls  It's Only Rock And Roll  Exile On Main Street  Sticky Fingers    The rest of their catalog is hard to categorize because it is so varied and my preference for all their other albums changes frequently. This one is definitely one of the best rock albums ever made, but it is almost like a concept album with its intentional avoidance of mainstream music and is a delicious acquired taste.    This is probably not a good album to introduce someone to this band. It would be better to start with their Forty Licks greatest hits package, but any of the other above mentioned albums is solid enough to please any fan of rock music.    Highly Recommended (For people who are already fans of the Stones)
B001F12J0C|3.0|The Bourne series is extremely well produced with Hollywood's elite level of craftsman no doubt and Matt Damon is solid in the role as Jason Bourne. But I have watched all three movies back to back twice now trying to figure out what all the hype was about and why these films were so hugely successful....and I guess it's the simple excuse for action through some of Europe's most beautiful cities and of course it's always fun to see some hero completely destroy a seemingly invincible system...but my gosh people....IT'S THE SAME MOVIE OVER AND OVER AGAIN!!!! I FEEL LIKE I'M TAKING CRAZY PILLS!!!! Yes if you have seen the first movie you have seen them all!!!! A show down with fists and kicks, a couple of shoot outs and a car chase....and yep some smug suit gets taken down for some reason...I don't know. Great action series done over and over and over again and from what I here this is going to be repeated in a fourth....
B000001EUN|3.0|The scorpions have 2 phases in their careers. The 2 eras are personified by their lead guitarists at the time. The Uli Roth era and the Mathias Jabs era. The early Roth days have them sounding more like a Hendrix/Zepellin hybrid while the Jabs era was when they became 80s metal icons. Released in 1980, this record clearly belongs in the 2nd camp. Jabs had just joined the band on the album Lovedrive, which came before this. On this one you can hear difficulties in the band gelling together. Lovedrive is head and shoulders above this album but the lead guitar duties on that album were shared by Jabs, rhythm guitarist Rudy Schenker and Rudy's brother, legendary guitarist Michael Schenker.     Animal Magnetism still managed to give the band some concert staples in The Zoo and Don't Make No Promises (Your Body Can't Keep). Make It Real is also one of the best songs that the band ever recorded. The rest of the album lags. The ballad, Lady Starlight, is the last saving grace of an otherwise lukewarm album. If you like the metal sound of the Scorpions in the 80s then get Blackout, Lovedrive, Love At First Sting or Crazy World. Any of those are sure to please.
B00049QQHI|5.0|Leonardo DiCaprio takes us on a journey into the agonies of a teenager on the worst path possible. This movie descends into the depths of depravity and sadness. DiCaprio, as another reviewer wrote ,amazingly was but 20 years old when he turned in this powerhouse of a performance. Little by little we see the way he gets into this lost soul and makes him so believable and pathetically authentic. One of the  best moments is when Dicaprio and the 2 buddies who followed him down into the sewers of human existence see the young man who<br />was a part of the gang but he stayed clean and persued his dreams as a basketball player. He is up there on the television living a healthy happy life than any of the three others could have shared. The look in Leonardo's eyes says it all, even in his drugged up state there was a miniscule possibility that he could get himself together and return to a decent life. Another wonderful scene was when the actor Ernie Hudson, takes DiCaprio home, seeing himself many years ago in a similar crisis and wanting to do the right thing to help a fallen friend. That was heartwrenching with DiCaprio deprived of heroin having a meltdown while Hudson tried to be a support, ignoring the most disgusting behavoir by Leonardo who looked like a wounded bird just trying to make it through the next 15 minutes. Also as brilliant as DiCaprio is Lorraine Bracco, who we will always of course think of as Tony Soprano's shrink, playing DiCaprio's Mom with love and she too has her own emotional meltdown in that wonderful scene where she is on one side of the door, and he is leaning in across the chain, desperate for a few bucks to feed his habit. She is forced to call the cops on her own out of control son. Of course this movie is based on a real man who found his way back to a happy and healthy and sane existence. How triumphant !!!  Mark Wahlberg gave his own gritty and skilled performance of a teenager as lost as DiCaprio. Painful, but well worth watching.
B000N2HCM4|5.0|I rate this book highly, and think all Americans should read it simply because it is important for Americans to know the threat they face. Everyone should read this book and know who is sitting in the white house. The threat the Liberal Democratic party poses to America, and the Socialist goals of Obama is real. The racist leanings in this book tell the truth. Read it, but not just really the words, but the meaning, depth and scope of this racist man. Obama is a racist. Read Mein Kampf and look at the lessons from history about the slow subtle rise to power many dictators had. Hitler and Obama have many many things in common. Yes I give this book a high rating, and thik it is a must read, but now as a worshiper of Obama like most Americans do, but as a patriot, that reads the text, and sees the threat Obama poses to freedom and democracy.
0140143505|5.0|I owe the discovery of this wonderful book to DH, before he was DH, in fact. He gave the movie to me for my birthday--the first birthday I had after we started dating. Along with the Old Friends Simon & Garfunkel box set and a kiss. At the time we were living in different cities and meeting up somewhere in the middle for our \\"dates.\\" So I drove home that night and watched the movie all by myself. I cried. Twice. I laughed and laughed and laughed. And I went out and bought the book immediately. I was on my way to London for a study abroad program and so it was a going away gift of sorts. He's particularly good with gifts, as you can tell. It is without a doubt my very favorite memoir and the movie adaptation starring Anne Bancroft and Anthony Hopkins is pretty much my favorite movie of all time. Just another of those little things that my man brought to my life that I might never have found without him.<br /><br />84, CHARING CROSS ROAD tells the true story of Helene Hanff and Frank Doell. Helene is a loudmouth, eccentric, struggling writer from New York. Frank is a quiet, reserved, always proper bookseller from London. In a fit of rage at being unable to find the vintage editions of classic books she loves in New York, Helene drafts a letter to Marks & Co.--an antiquarian bookshop located at 84, Charing Cross Rd. The first letter reads as follows:<br /><br />\\"Gentlemen:<br /><br />Your ad in the Saturday Review of Literature says that you specialize in out-of-print books. The phrase \\"antiquarian booksellers\\" scares me somewhat, as I equate \\"antique\\" with expensive. I am a poor writer with an antiquarian taste in books and all the things I want are impossible to get over here except in very expensive rare editions, or in Barnes and Noble's grimy, marked-up schoolboy copies.<br /><br />I enclose a list of my most pressing problems. If you have clean secondhand copies of any of the books on the list, for no more than $5.00 each, will you consider this a purchase order and send them to me?<br /><br />Very truly yours,<br />Helene Hanff<br />(Miss) Helene Hanff\\"<br /><br />And that is how this exquisite little gem of bibliophilia begins. Frank Doell answers Miss Hanff's letter on behalf of Marks & Co., signing his letter FPD. Over the course of twenty years, these two book lovers exchange letters and, in the process, become fast friends. Though they never actually meet, their friendship spans years, nationalities, personalities, and an ocean.<br /><br />It's hard for me to express how much I love this collection of letters. I'm always wanting to talk about it with other readers but know few outside my immediate family who've heard of it let alone read it. Which is sad as, when I think about books about books and book lovers, I have a difficult time coming up with a better, more moving and intensely personal story. It doesn't hurt that I'm extremely tactile when it comes to my love of books. I adore owning multiple editions, particularly old, used, loved copies picked up in used bookshops around the world. The day I walked into Hay-on-Wye I promptly broke out into a cold sweat at the sheer number of \\"antiquarian booksellers\\" within a one-mile radius. And in this book, Helene Hanff's love for the physical books themselves, the words within, and British literature especially just suffuses this reader with joy and a beautiful sense of camaraderie. I hope that, if you haven't picked 84, CHARING CROSS ROAD up yet, you will.y truly yours,   Helene Hanff   (Miss) Helene Hanff\\"    And that is how this exquisite little gem of bibliophilia begins.

B000WCBPOG|5.0|I don't like the beatles per say but I do enjoy the songs when another artist does them. I found this soundtrack to be full of incredible versions of the beatles songs. I loved the movie and this just allows me to bring that experience wherever I go.
0385504225|4.0|Unlike the Da Vinci Code this time page turner Dan Brown sets the action and keeps it in Washington DC. I won't go into the plot details as many others have already done that here. Suffice it to say this time it involves the Masons and the upper echelons of US government. Obviously this novel isn't to be judged on high literary merits, but in terms of pop novel entertainment, it rates high. I stayed up late into the night to find out the denouement of the story. The secret being sought is not as interesting as in the Da Vinci code, but fascinating nonetheless. In my opinion all the negative reviews are just plain jealousy. If it is so easy to write a page turner all of us would be on the Bestseller list too.
B00006I53S|5.0|The Canon 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 lens with Image Stabilization is a very capable, and more importantly, affordable lens,and is perfect for times when you just want to have one lens on the camera but you also want to have a lot of options with your focal range.  While you get the benefits of a slight wide to telephoto range in one handy package, you do lose in light stops as you move through the focal range (the maximum aperture stops down as you move toward the telephoto end of the range).  This is where the image stabilization comes in very handy, and allows you to keep hand shake at bay even when you have to compromise on shutter speed to get the correct exposure.<br /><br />I've had no complaints about the optical quality, I think you'll be pleased with the shots you get from it - the lens may be cheap but don't confuse that with what the quality of image this lens can provide.  Keep in mind on a camera with a cropped sensor (any Canon DSLR model other than the 5D and 1D models) the focal range is equivalent to @45-215mm - you lose a bit of the wide angle advantage, but you get more telephoto, so it depends which end of the focal range you value the most as to whether that is a disadvantage or not.

B000THGR0Q|5.0|When I first heard this album, at its time of release in the 70s, I was hooked.  Coming from an Anglo-Saxon heritage, it naturally stirs my soul and is one of those rare albums that gives one the illusion of a total diversion from the present day when sequestered under headphones.  It is by far the very best of Tull to me, if I were made to make a choice.  A lot of thought, and no doubt research into madrigals, went into its concept.  At its release, no one had conceptualized whole albums like Tull could.  What's remarkable is how repeatedly playable the album was, and still is, at a time when no one published recordings anything like them.
B00005ONMP|3.0|ok.....this will do.....but I cannot call it favored....Toscanini and Szell owned this music when they performed it....the Third usually gets good performances by many conductors......Toscanini gave the Reformation fire that will never be equalled, even in an inferior sonic version of many years ago.....history forces later conductors to compete with the greatest of the great...impossible task.....
B001FB4W0W|3.0|True Blood is a decent show.  It's definitely different than I expected.  I expected something like Underworld but it is more about relationships between the humans and the vampires.  A couple of the characters, including the main character, are bipolar. You mostly just find yourself wanting to know how it ends and are interested in maybe one or two characters.  I plan to watch the second season to see if it gets any better. Overall, it's worth a watch.
B002KLAL4W|2.0|I'm a diehard Pearl Jam fan, and I think I've got just about everything they've ever recorded in studio (B-sides, demos, etc.). Such meaningful, socially conscious, intelligent, nuanced, diverse, and GOOD music! When their self-titled album was released several years ago, I was disappointed with the overall garage sound of the recording and found myself playing that album less than anything they'd released previously. Interestingly, though, I can still listen to that album and appreciate its overall progression, peaks and valleys, and gems such as \\"Inside Job\\" and \\"Gone.\\" Even if it wasn't their best, as with most of their material, I found that it could reveal something new with repeated listens.     Not sure I can say the same for Backspacer. The harder stuff on their latest album continues in the vein of punk rock stylings spearheaded with Spin the Black Circle (which I've never liked) that has become more and more of a staple of their sound over the past 10 years. A few interesting chord progressions here and there (Johnny Guitar), but for me, these are rendered unenjoyable by incessant vocals that give the songs a flat, chugger feeling. Vedder's lyrics are always thought-provoking and genuine--and on this album, they're more light-hearted and less political--but sometimes, there are just too many.     Maybe I'm just biased against the new wavish stuff as I enjoy dynamics as opposed to speedy monotone strumming, but someone who shares this preference will probably NOT enjoy this album. Sure, songs like the supposedly \\"poppy\\" \\"The Fixer\\" are more mid-tempo, but the chugger quality remains--and I honestly fail to see, as so many professional reviewers proclaim, how this song stands as some hugely catchy and accessible pop song that will garner a new host of crossover fans. Maybe among the PJ faithful, but I'd love to play it to 100 people who have never heard a PJ song and get their reaction.     Not much noticeable experimentation here--you won't hear anything like \\"You Are,\\" \\"Tremor Christ,\\" \\"Sleight of Hand,\\" or, \\"Inside Job.\\" Like these songs or not, they epitomize an adventurous yet melodic sound that gave former PJ albums the sonic peaks and valleys I mentioned earlier. I don't hear anything approaching that level of imagination here, just workman-like punk and acoustic stuff. Speaking of which, there are two solid, albeit unspectacular, acoustic numbers. \\"Just Breathe\\" is enjoyable, though the riff hearkens immediately to \\"Guaranteed\\" off of Into the Wild (excellent song off of an excellent album!) with a vocal verse that remind me of AIC's \\"Shame in You.\\" And speaking of Into the Wild, if you enjoy Vedder's rich, rustic, acoustic-y numbers, \\"The End\\" is worth a listen or two.    Maybe Backspacer will grow on me, but I've never been less satisfied with a PJ recording. Too much punk, which negates the power of Vedder's vocals, not enough variety, and nothing starkly imaginative. Ironically, Backspacer has been posited by critics as PJ's \\"fun\\" album. \\"State of Love and Trust\\" is fun--\\"The Fixer\\" is not. To each their own, of course.
0439023491|5.0|As with the first book ( the Hunger Games ) I just couldn't put it down.  Every twist and turn was a surprise. I read it in a day, lol.
B0010AN7Y0|5.0|Yes, the premise is the same as the Big Chill, but the story, characters, and feel of the movies are completely different.  They are not at all similar, and should not be compared and judged against one another.  Peter and friends do not sit around thinking about how idealistic they once were, and now look at us--which was the theme of the Big Chill.  I like and enjoy both movies.<br /><br />So, Peter's Friends is about a group of old college friends who used to perform in a musical revue.  They and some of their significant others gather at the stately home of Peter for a New Year's weekend.  The host is Peter, a man who may be gay, or maybe he's bisexual, or is he asexual, or is he just not sure?  Roger and Mary were both part of the college musical act.  They have married and are successful jingle writers, but the death of one of their infant twins has put a strain on them and their marriage.  Mary has turned into an over protective mother, obsessed with worry about the remaining twin.  Maggie is a \\"plain Jane\\" who wants to avoid impending spinster-hood, so she sets her cap for Peter, who as I already stated, isn't sure if he's interested in sex with anybody.  Sarah has had a long string of boyfriends because she only dates men who are married or involved with another woman.  She brings along her latest married lover, an obnoxious jerk that the others all loathe at first sight.  Andrew is a writer who has gone Hollywood, and isn't very satisfied by his successful career or his marriage to a fitness obsessed American actress.<br /><br />There are some dramatic scemes, as well as some very funny scenes.  I particularly like Rita Rudner's performance as the over the top glam actress who piles on layers of fake hair.  One of the best lines is when she asks the uncooperative housekeeper \\"Have you never seen Upstairs, Downstairs?\\"<br /><br />This is a movie you can watch over and over.  I'd like to have most of these people as friends--except for Sarah and Brian.  &lt;smile>
B0021L8UVC|3.0|I just never know what to expect from horror / sci-fi films. Sometimes they work and sometimes they don't. I can't think of too many times where it didn't work. I guess there's Supernova, Doom, Virus, John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars, and other films like that. But there's also the Alien movies, the first Species, Pitch Black, Event Horizon, and even the Resident Evil movies that hit the nail on the head. I would have to say Pandorum does a pretty decent job of hammering it down.<br /><br />Pandorum is loud, noisy, and has more gore than I think most \\"regular\\" moviegoers are probably used to. That being said, it also strives to be intelligent and arty. It's kind of a strange mix. It melds together elements of such films as Event Horizon, Alien, Resident Evil, and even The Poseidon Adventure. I mean, the whole film is about a guy trying to reach the reactor of the ship to turn it back on. Just imagine Gene Hackman (or Kurt Russell, if you've only seen the remake Poseidon) and company trying to get off the ship before it breaks apart...but they're being chased by cannibalistic monsters that look similar to the creatures in The Descent and seem to have superhuman strength and speed.<br /><br />The acting in the film for the most part is pretty decent. Dennis Quaid comes off kind of cheesy a few times and some of the dialogue for the other characters could have been spruced up a bit. There's really nothing to cry about, though. I was kind of excited to see that Norman Reedus (The Boondock Saints, Blade II, Deuces Wild, Gossip, Messengers 2: The Scarecrow) was in this, but was disappointed when his character gets dragged off a mere five minutes after he hits the screen.<br /><br />The special effects and cinematography were very stylistic. The scene of the \\"mutant\\" cannibal lair where they're all piled on each other and intertwined was reminiscent of the scene in Alien Resurrection where Ripley is lying with all the Aliens in their lair. Now imagine having to crawl through them covered in their skin to get to where you need to go. Yes, it is pretty nerve-wracking and disturbing. The ferocious way the \\"mutants\\" run, attack, and eat their prey is also a big visual highlight.<br /><br />You can tell that the writer of this film really did try to do something intelligent and new, while treading on some familiar ground. There's a pretty decent story lying under all the visual hocus-pocus and gore. I actually liked the end (one of them, at least), even though I could see it coming a mile away. I wanted to write that I didn't like it, but I just can't. It worked so well within the frame of the story.<br /><br />Is Pandorum a groundbreaking film? No. Is it going to shock genre fans and be the next big thing? No. Is it a good movie that entertains, but at the same time doesn't dumb anything down story wise for action and gore? Yes. Like I said earlier, your \\"normal\\" Friday night movie-going audience will probably find it more shocking and gory than us genre gore hounds. It was still a good watch.skin to get to where you need to go. Yes, it is pretty nerve-wracking and disturbing.

0385504225|2.0|I read the whole book, and was compelled to finish it.  I did want to see exactly how everything turned out.  Fortunately I am an avid reader, so this was no huge task.    By the halfway point of the book, I really didn't care about the fates of the characters.  I thought Mal'akh was just too dark and too far gone.    What I did enjoy was the scenery of Washington D.C.  I've only had the chance to visit once, and didn't have time to see everything.  The descriptions of the buildings and artwork were excellent, and have increased my interest in another, longer, potential visit to the Capitol.  This, however, does not carry the story.
B002IVLH60|4.0|This is Pearl Jam's best album of the 2000s. Continuing where Pearl Jam left off, the band matches the energy of their last outing with better, tighter songs. The lyrics (notably, all are credited to Vedder) are exceptional. No longer bound by anti-Bush righteous rage, Vedder seems to feel freed to sing songs with more empathy and positive energy. There are still plenty of songs about troubled souls and surfing, but the overall tone is warmer and filled more with empathy than anger.<br /><br />The band's playing is excellent as always, and Brendan O'Brien's return to the fold is welcome - this album, even more than the Ten Redux cd, is proof positive that O'Brien is THE man to produce Pearl Jam's albums. He adds a few touches of keyboards and strings here and there to augment the standard guitar/bass/drums rock format, and the result is a sound perfectly suited to Pearl Jam's strongest batch of songs in years.<br /><br />Pearl Jam fans who have been waiting for a new great album but weren't quite convinced by their previous cd should give this one a shot, and fans who have stuck with the band all these years will not be disappointed. This is Pearl Jam for 2009 and beyond.

0385504225|4.0|Wow, some of these reviews are absolutely brutal!  This is not one of them.  I'm not a fan of fiction in general.  However, I enjoy Dan Brown's novels because they interlace history, religion, and story together.  I was quite entertained and couldn't put the book down.  Although it was easy to see where the story was headed, I enjoyed the journey.    I think that some of the reviewers here expect too much from a novel!  This is entertainment, folks...

You can only hear the background music. No dialogue. I figured that it was a defective dvd and requested a new copy. Amazon was very helpful in the return process. They sent me a replacement dvd right away. Unfortunately, the new dvd had the same problem as the other, no sound. I had send both dvds back and requested a refund. I received my refund in about a week. This has been the only problem that I have had with Amazon. But, they handled my return/refund so well, I continue shopping from them.

0385504225|5.0|Great writing!  I loved it.  I didn't think he could top THE DA VINCI CODE, but he has.  Unfortunately, it seems that many people are missing the point.  This is fiction layered onto fact!  And what a wonderful job Dan Brown has done.  The architecture of Washington, D. C., the art work, the basic premises of the Masons . . . have all been so well researched that everything he has created here is plausible--even though it's FICTION.  Readers need to remember this.  As he did with THE DA VINCI CODE, he tells us at the beginning what is fact, expecting us to know that out of fact he has created fiction.    From the first page to the last I loved it.  Even after the climax and resolution of what might be perceived as the main plot, I was still in thrall, right down to the last word. I am already anticipating his next novel.

Some days, you feel a little more logical - spreadsheets and word docs make you happy, while the thought of having to draw a happy face makes you frown.<br /><br />Well, Daniel Pink, author of A Whole New Mind, invites you to re-think the sides of the brain.  He takes you on a journey through research and brain MRI's that show how you respond to certain stimuli.  The book is a fascinating look at the way our brain functions, responds to events, triggers memories and pulls the pieces of situations into a coherent picture that we understand.<br /><br />The design industry uses the right brain to help create new art pieces, new furniture and who knows what else.  The left brain is our logic side - calculations and critical thinking are found here.  However, Daniel identifies and stipulates, that the best individual is one who can pull the right information from the appropriate side of the brain and put it together to fit the situation.  Sometimes we need more logic and less creativity and vice versa.<br /><br />He explains that when someone has a stroke on the right side of the brain it affects their left side and vice versa.  Sometimes we encounter people who appear to not understand what we are saying - that might actually be because that person doesn't have full use of that particular part of the brain.  I could be jesting about something and the person may take me literally.<br /><br />Daniel suggests that we need to develop \\"a whole new mind\\" to evaluate situations and events that utilize both sides of the brain in equal amounts.  This book focuses on the idea that right brain thinking will be depended on heavily in the future as we grow and change the way we interact.<br /><br />This book was fantastic!  If you are a research junkie, you will not be disappointed.  If you work in a logical business (engineering for example), I would highly suggest that you challenge your staff or leaders to read this book and begin implementing an alternative way of thinking.

B000W91RUG|5.0|From the initial nanosecond the Big Bang Theory is a smart, funny and hilarious show.  Sheldon. Leonard, Howard and Rajesh are all brilliant Caltech scientists in their mid or late twentys, interacting with Penny, a beautiful blonde waitress and aspiring actress.  It is a well written comedy, with excellent lines and funny situations that somehow makes you to establish an inmediate rapport with the main characters. It is intelligently cool and delightful, geeky, trekkie, hilarious, the big bang fun!

B000FJUMNG|4.0|Bradbury by his own admission has always deemed himself to be more than a SciFi writer. And this book has stood the test of time. Written so long ago that the calendar dates 1999 or 2001 seemed soi distant and perhaps not attainable by Americans living in the Cold War.  These are a collection of vignettes about the early exploration and human settling on Mars. The novel's Mars is radically unlike the one we know now so much about. To wit, the real Mars is a place where humans could only live in enclosed climate controlled domes akin to what we saw in the Schwarznegger film \\"Total Recall\\".  These are great and timeless stories. I think I read the book as a teen and a few years later with the first images transmitted back to earth from the Viking Mars lander the news actually cut away to interview Bradbury himself.  When the book was adapted into a screen play with Rock Hudson and other prominent actors the opening scene plays homage to the Viking lander. We see the lander excavating a small amount of martian soil from the lifeless surface of that planet. And then a voiceover announces \\"..however, had the craft only landed a mile or so away it would have seen the remnants of a once vibrant civilization!!\\" and sure enough you see just over the immediate horizon all manner of structures suggesting intelligent life and habitation.    One story in the collection involves a post nuclear war, fully-automated house. The computer that runs the house has somehow managed to survive and function even though all its residents were fried in the nuclear blast. In our own era of programmable this and that (coffee makers, household thermostats etc) the automated house does seem prophetic! A voice announces wich bills are payable today and having had to pay online at the last minute, I know I'd pay to have such a feature.

B00275EHCI|3.0|Provided you're a fairly willing subject for the suspension of disbelief, Surrogates works, for the most part, throughout its relatively short duration. Sadly, as soon as the lights go up (even sooner if you're a firm advocate of reality) the flood of questions begin to pick the story and its prophetic premise apart. A future where technology has advanced so far that nearly everyone has sacrificed their humanity and physical interaction with virtual reality and the use of perfect human duplicates is certainly no dull setting. So why are people still driving around beat-up old cars? This query and many more weaken the innovation of the creation on display and a \\"seen-it-coming-from-a-mile-away\\" conspiracy angle doesn't help much either. At least in this world full of plastic humans, the majority of the actors fit right in.<br /><br />In the future, computer and robotics technology has progressed so far that humans can live out their lives and fantasies through the safety of android \\"surrogates\\". But the supposedly risk-free robots become deadly when FBI agents Tom Greer (Bruce Willis) and Jennifer Peters (Radha Mitchell) discover a weapon that can kill human users through their surrogates. When the son of prominent scientist and surrogate creator Lionel Canter (James Cromwell) is murdered, the two agents must track down a mysterious killer and stop a devious mastermind from executing a plan that could destroy their world forever.<br /><br />It's an invasion of the inhuman, a revolution of doppelgangers, an army of body snatchers. It's like playing inside of a video game, or plugging into \\"The Matrix,\\" where all of the senses can be used to their fullest extent, all while the \\"operator\\" is in the safety of a cushy bed. But it's like \\"The Island,\\" \\"I, Robot,\\" \\"The Stepford Wives,\\" \\"Minority Report,\\" \\"Terminator\\" (and even \\"Coraline\\") and almost every science-fiction film in the last decade recklessly blended together. The idea is creepy, freaky, thought-provoking, and definitely interesting, riddled with imminent disaster, conspiracies and murder. But with a short runtime and entirely too much to define, Surrogates suffers from a neat and tidy conclusion that cheats the complexity of the setting.<br /><br />Very early on, when Greer admits that every perfectly proportioned surrogate is probably just a fat guy, lounging around in a bathrobe, inappropriately exposed, it's clear that the writers aren't trying to hide the silliness of the concepts their world is based upon. Who knew that such heavy science-fiction themes could be so purposefully comical? Usually these films try incredibly hard to convince the audience that the ideas are plausible, or at the very least to suspend disbelief. The unintentional humor is usually unstoppable, but in Surrogates, at least for a few fleeting scenes, it is wholeheartedly embraced. Apparently even in a world of fake people, Bruce Willis can still keep it real.<br /><br />- The Massie Twinsesting, riddled with imminent disaster, conspiracies and murder.

B000T9QF8S|2.0|Having enjoyed the recent boon of wonderful Beethoven from both Jarvi and Vanska - and to a lesser extent van Immerseel and Zinman - I decided to revisit and reassess my Beethoven collection, cycle by cycle, not only to hear how interpretations have changed over the decades but also to hear if my memory was serving me correctly. And, of course, I was pleasantly surprised by how much good Beethoven there is out there - the early Toscanni NBC cycle, the fabulous pair of Cleveland cycles from Szell and Dohnanyi, Bloomstedt's traditional cycle in Dresden, Sawallisch in Amsterdam, the early Karajan cycle, the estimable Wand in Hamburg, Harnoncourt with the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, the always exciting Bohm, Ferencsik's workman cycle in Hungry, Jarvi with his fabulous Bremen players, Vanska's stunning Minnesota cycle, Zinman's fine Tonhalle efforts, Haitink's recent London cycle, as well as the various period cycles from Hogwood, Bruggen, and van Immerseel. And then I stumbled upon this Solti set with the Chicago Symphony tucked away at the very back of one of my CD drawers. I remembered I was none too impressed with this cycle, but thought I would give it a second lease on life. Thirty seconds into the Pastorale, I realized why I never listened to these performances. They are, simply put, dreadful.     Indeed, so bad are these performances that I hardly thought they were worth reviewing, but upon seeing the endless praise for Solti in this music, I felt I had to offer a balanced perspective and challenge the reviewers who have deemed this cycle \\"reference.\\"     Of course, there is no \\"one way\\" to conduct Beethoven. There is the \\"German School,\\" recently represented by Barenboim in his Staatskapelle Berlin cycle. Then there are the Szell's and Vanska, big-band Beethoven with crisp rhythms and razor sharp precision. There are also the Period/HIP bunch, exemplified by a fine cycle from Bruggen with his period band and Jarvi and his HIP Bremen chamber orchestra. Wand andBloomstedt for yet another group, where architecture is emphasized. And, naturally, conductors fall here and there within the spectrum, with some being easily classifiable, such as Abaddo, while others are certainly at the outer limits, like Harnoncourt. But even at his strangest, Harnoncourt still has something interesting and provocative to say in this music. Sadly, I cannot say the same for Solti.     Starting with the Pastorale, Solti just does not know how to effectively shape musical phrases in a way that generates tension. Take the Thunderstorm as a prime example. Solti's conducting is very four-square, with brass interjections that, while powerful, simply hang, stagnant and unmoving. It is uncomfortably blocky, stiff, and unnatural. Certainly, there are those that might find Solti's aggressiveness and roughness appealing, but I challenge these listeners to compare Solti's Thunderstorm to either Bohm or Vanska. Taking the later as a comparison, listen to how both Solti and Vanska have the brass play out, but listen to how Vanksa's trumpets and horns do not simply blurt out their notes; rather, they shape the music, propelling it forward. Or listen to how the great storm climax in Vanska's hands is both powerful, but sounds oddly like .. well, a thunderstorm, where Solti seems to have plateaus of forte followed by plateaus of piano. That same symphony's hymn of thanksgiving in the finale is particularly awful. Solti's interpretation aside (again, pleateaus of forte), listen to how the strings are just grinding away at their tremolo figures while the diffuse and unfocused bass line plods along below in a particularly lifeless manor. Again, listen to how Vanska creates an organ-like sheen, drives the music to a particular point of climax rather than let is sit there at one dynamic, while maintaining textural clarity.     The Eighth is equally repugnant. The minuet is very slow and heavy, which is not a problem at all in my book so long as the conductor highlights Beethoven's humor in this mecurial movement. But Solti seems uninterested in Beethoven's jokes, simply scuffling along with only the end in sight. Compare this to Szell's minuet, taken at a similar tempo. Listen to how Szell really highlights the comedy, with those thrilling trumpets blasting in mocking bombast, timpani pounding, bassoons chuckling. Solti's finale is equally problematic, with only two dynamic levels (loud or soft) and particularly diffuse and distant sounding winds.     The first movement of the Eroica is one of the longest on disc, at just under twenty (20) minutes, but sounds nearly twice as long because Solti fails to elicit the level of clarity that should be achieved at this speed in order to generate tension. Just listen to the first tutti outburst, again where the violins are just grinding away with no sense of balance while the brass leap in and out of the texture. Solti's limp strings and reticent brass sound pathetic next to the power of Karjan's Berlin Philharmonic, but even chamber-sized orchestras, like Harnoncourt's Chamber Orchestra of Europe or Jarvi's Bremen players manage \\"bigness\\" where Solti creates none. Even conductors who do keep the brass in check, such as Szell, still manage to generate more tension by increasing the dynamic level (as Beethoven intends) towards to dissonant pile-up and resulting b-major transition into the e-minor theme.     Being Chicago, you expect greatness from the brass. That being said, the finale of the Fifth is just vulgar, plagued by poor ensemble work. The brass plays loudly and, when it stops, there are dynamic drop-offs that rob the music of any tension. But the blame clearly lies at the feet of Solti. Just listen to how shockingly unmoving the huge G-major cadence sounds. The build-up to this usually fool-proof moment shows exactly how inept Solti's podium work actually is. The interchange between the winds and the trumpets, both of which are pounding the \\"fate\\" rhythm, are too reticent, covered by absolutely sloppy string playing. Solti chooses the wrong moment to climax, the arrival of the cadence, rather than the ghost of the scherzo, which makes it's reappearance less dramatic than necessary. All in all, Solti fails to realize the intentions of the composer and the potential of this music. In music this ubiquitous, the competition is stiffer than anything else. One need only listen to Kleiber to hear how this music should sound, a reference performance of the Fifth. But there are dozens of better fifths on the market, from the big and creamy Blomstedt to the lithe and fierce Jarvi.     Solti's \\"one size fits all\\" approach to the symphonies makes this performance of the Second sound quite odd. This is a big, middle-period approach to a transitional work which altogether fails to capture the humor of the final two movements or the bravura of Beethoven's expanded sonata structure. The largo simply drags, due more to Solti failure to elicit crisp articulation from his players rather than the slow basic tempo. A clearly etched bass line would have helped here, as Vanska achieves in his magnificent Second. I can admire Solti's energy, but it is often misplaced, especially in the finale, where tutti passages lumber, rhythm is limp, and vigor replaces clear ensemble work or orchestral transparency.     Solti's Ninth certainly has its fans, and indeed, there are moments that truly pack a wallop. The sheer impact of the chorus in the finale, the monumentality of Solti's conception, including an awesomely effective \\"Gott\\" cadence, milked for all its worth, are all quite appealing. The great fugue is undeniably fierce and embarrassingly effective. But Solti is most persuasive, at the big moments, where his muscularity and his inherent vulgarity go hand in hand. Ironically, when the music actually calls for excess, as in the awkward Turkish March, with its belching contrabassoon and janissary effects, Solti is reserved. Tenor Schunk's contribution, which embracesBeethoven's intentions, becomes all the more awkward vis-à-vis Solti's reticence. Bigness pervades the opening allegro as well, but with portentous weight that is light on excitement. Those seeking a \\"big\\" Ninth need only listen to Gunter Wand's fabulous Choral Symphony, which has all the power and energy of Solti, but with better playing, better balance, and a much, much better architectural and emotional conception. As a direct comparison, listen to Solti's opening to the finale to Wand's NDR performance, where the orchestra creates a truly visceral yet balanced sound, unlike Solti's unbalanced mess.     At his best, as in the violently aggressive (but sloppily played) Coriolan Overture or in the finale of the Seventh, I can certainly appreciate Solti's vigor. And indeed, Beethoven's music can stand up to Solti's roughness much better than many of the other composers he recorded in Chicago; his Bruckner, for example, has the subtlety of a shotgun, and his Mahler was very hit-or-miss. That being said, if it sounds like I have lambasted Solti achievement, which in most part I certainly have, it is only because there is so much greatness in this music that listeners should not have to settle for simply good-enough performances. That conductors like Vanska and Jarvi can make this music, music every classical listener knows by heart, sound new and exciting and fresh shows how brilliant the canonic nice really are. Don't settle for performances that are good; you can do better, be it the bigness of Wand, the vigor of Vanska, the freshness of Jarvi, the architecture of Haitink, the zeal of Zinman, the bumptiousness of Blomstedt, the idiosyncraticies of Harnoncourt, or the brio of Toscanni.     Hopefully, as both new recordings and new listeners enter the market, the veneration of Solti will be expunged. Pass.
B000002G7E|2.0|2 1/2<br /><br />The extra-raw production does not compliment underwritten songs here -a downgraded formula which had seemingly eluded the band before and after- though here really shows a rough internal process at its coarsest and least inspired.

I'm probably a lil biased since Megadeth is my fav group for over the last 17 or so years and I enjoy everything thats been released from Megadave. So while I'm not sure this will weigh in your decision to get this, I think if you ever liked Megadeth in whatever period, you should get this, you will like it. I am one who also enjoyed Death Magnetic from Metallica so am not one who likes to compare the two bands, like so many do, if you like Death Magnetic then there's absolutely no way you dont like ENDGAME. I will say, that even though I like everything they've put out, it seems to me that Megadeth plugged alot more energy into the music on this one, you can just tell from the get go. Thank you Megadeth for being here.

I laughed at Miss Amanda's quirky little reactions. I love movies one has to pay attention to in order to keep up with the story and you do have to pay attention here. There are some moments when you slap your palm to your face and go, \\"What the heck?\\" Miss Amanda compares her world to that of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice and wishes fervently that she was in that world. There's an old saying that is very applicable here: be careful what you wish for.    A fun,twisted, pay attention movie that I highly recommend.

0385341008|4.0|WWII started in America when I was ten; before that we listened to the short wave radio broadcasting from London.  I listened to the bombing of the city, the noises from the rockets in London.  I knew about the city children being taken north, away from their families.  Until this book I was unaware of the lives of those who sent their children away from the terror of the blitz, and those who ket them near.  This book made me want to go to  Jersey - such a lovely place it must be.  I never knew much about the channel islands or thought about the isolation they experienced during the War.  The story is rather light story and a bit contrived, but I would read it again if there weren't so many books and so little time.  I may not have read it if my book club hadn't chosen it.  Kudos to the book club and to the author.
B002GZQY6Q|4.0|Here it is, \\"The Incident,\\" Porcupine Tree's tenth studio release. This CD is a double album, with CD one the epic 55 minute long, 14 part track entitled \\"The Incident\\" and CD number two with four unrelated songs. This CD is overall pretty great but it doesn't feel as inspired as other Porcupine Tree releases.     Porcupine Tree is by far my favorite band and over their entire catalogue, something has always grabbed me and shook me up in ways that I cannot forget. But with this CD, I sadly don't feel that same special something. Sure the CD sounds great and many of the tracks are interesting but many don't feel as expanded on as they should have been.     Well before starting the review, I'm going to touch on the concept for a minute. The first disc of The Incident deals with the detatched usage of the word \\"Incident\\" and several incidents in Steven Wilson's life (PT's Frontman) from growing up, friendships, an experience in a seance, an actual traffic incident, and other things. The concept works because for drivers, a sign up ahead saying incident, left lane blocked is an inconveinence but for the person involved, its not, \\"whoops I had an incident\\" but a major catastrophe especially when lives are lost. The concept is loose but is something that listeners can relate to. Disc two is unrelated to the concept but features some good material none the less.    \\"The Incident\\"    Track 1 \\"Occam's Razor\\" This track is mostly an intro to the album as a whole. It is a succession of some heavy guitar accompanied by drums but overall isn't too interesting. 6/10     Track 2 \\"The Blind House\\" This track begins in a familiar Porcupine Tree fashion with an interesting time signerature and great drumming. I feel the chorus really grabs you in this one and the lyrics are pretty great. This track does feature an electronic break down in the middle which adds a haunting atmosphere which sounds really cool. (Overall this track is about a cult of some sort where a group of people, whoI believe were either all women or mostly women or girls were kept in a house at all times and led to believe there was no world outside their building. Police or someone broke them out of their house and the song is about their experience.) 10/10    Track 3 \\"Great Expectations\\" This song begins acoustically and features some interesting vocals and guitar. However this is one of the songs that seems short. Not even two minutes long, this song feels like it had promise but falls short by ending. (This song supposedly is about Steven Wilson's childhood friend who later he found out ended up in some sort of a mental institution) 7/10    Track 4 \\"Kneel And Disconnect\\" Another short song but this one has some really soft keys and beautiful vocal harmonies. (This song is about how Steven had quite a lucritive job but quit it for his own satisfaction of starting do play and record music as a career) 9/10     Track 5 \\"Drawing The Line\\" This song begins with some interesting keyboard work and a pretty creepy atmoshphere. I really enjoy the verses and even the chorus which most people reviewing this album seem to have a problem with. I feel that the ending really reminds me of their album Signify, in particular the title track. 8/10    Track 6 \\"The Incident\\" This song has a really cool industrial beat and some awesome swirling guitars that eventually explode into some awesome drop B (I think) meshuggah like riffage. The drumming in this song when it kicks in is really great. However the song ends on a happier note which leads to the next track. (This song is about a traffic incident) 9.5/10    Track 7 \\"Your Unpleasant Family\\" This song has some interesting solo work that reminds me of Stupid Dream but overall feels like filler through out. 6.5/10    Track 8 \\"The Yellow Windows of the Evening Train\\" This song features some interesting key work and slightly soothing but yet disconcerning music box music and voices. It mostly works as a transition to the next track \\"Time Flies.\\" The music box like sounds symbolize a return to childhood. 7/10    Track 9 \\"Time Flies\\" After a while you realize time flies and the album is almost over! Time flies is a great piece with an acoustic beginning which explodes into something reminiscent of Stupid Dream and Lightbulb Sun. It's overall a catchy song and has a really heart felt solo. (This song is about childhood and growing up. It often seems the older you get the quicker time seems to fly, which I believe everyone can relate to). 10/10    Track 10 \\"Degree Zero of Liberty\\" This track repeats some of the opening riffs of Occam's Razor with some beautiful guitar work. It is all instrumental. 8/10    Track 11 \\"Octane Twisted\\" I really enjot this one, it has a really great verse that repeats again in track 12, The Seance. it is probably one of the heaviest songs in The Incident and has a really cool breakdown with odd time signeratures and some good soloing. 9/10    Track 12 \\"The Seance\\" This piece I feel really brought the album full circle. It has a beautiful feel and beginning which eventually repeats the verses from Octane Twisted. But unfortunately the song is ready to end almost too soon but at least the acoustic guitar ending sounds cool. 9/10    Track 13 \\"Circle of Manias\\" This is a two minute instrumental piece that reminds me a little bit of Mother and Child Divided from the limited edition of the Deadwing album. It has some cool time signeratures and good riffage.    Track 14 \\"I Drive The Hearse\\" This is my favorite song on the album. I feel this song is soft, melancholy, beautiful and has a great solo. It's another song that I feel grabs me but it's a shame its the end of the album. Steven Wilson's voice really shines through this one and it has some great vocal harmonies. 10/10    The Incident is a good epic but I feel if some of the shorter tracks were increased in length it would be incredible. Not to make it overly long, but the CD I feel needs a little more power or a little more trimmingof the transition tracks.    Now on to Disc 2    Track 1 \\"Flicker\\" This song has the sound of traditional PT, and I really enjoy the vocals on this one. The keys sound really nice also. 9/10    Track 2 \\"Bonnie The Cat\\" Not nearly as cute as it sounds this song has odd time signeratures aplenty and some awesome bass work. I really enjoy the creepy atmoshpere of this song! 10/10    Track 3 \\"Black Dahlia\\" This song I feel has some good keyboard work but doesn't really expand on its base enough. 7/10.     Track 4 \\"Remember Me Lover\\" This song is a great ending to the second disc and the album as a whole. It has a great beginning with haunting keys and dreamy guitar work and vocals. The chorus is also pretty catchy. 10/10    I said it before and I'll say it again, I love Porcupine Tree, but this album just doesn't seem to stand up their previous releases. It sure has its moments in The Blind House, Time Flies, The Incident, Remember Me Lover, Flicker, Bonnie The Cat, and especially in I Drive the Hearse but compared to the awesome \\"Anesthetize\\" track that just grabbed you and shook and wouldn't let go making your stereo a machine, \\"Lazarus\\" with beautiful rolling piano and tearful vocals, \\"Blackest Eyes\\" with beautiful guitar work and a great chorus, \\"Russia On Ice\\" with fantastic strings and rocking drums at the end, \\"Don't Hate Me\\" which featured beautiful flute, saxophone, a melancholy atmosphere, and a beautiful guitar solo at the end, and \\"Every Home Is Wired\\" with excellent vocal harmonies unlike nothing I have ever heard, the Incident just doesn't seem to have these moments. Its a great album but just doesn't feel up to par.     I hope this review helps. Enjoy!

B0002W4SWC|1.0|This movie is attempting to cloak a backlash ideology in a type of imitation-feminism.  Bridget Jones is the remake of Elizabeth Bennett from Pride and Prejudice without the intellectual capacity, class, and dignity. In the original story Elizabeth Bennett is not perfect; this idea of imperfection becomes a repeated theme in the Jones movie with one big difference--Jones lacks virtues.  Bennett's imperfections are also her virtues; she was blunt but by being forthcoming she was wise. In this new make Bridget is self-defacing.  She views herself as inadequate and the only way that she can fix her flaws is by gaining the affections of a male.  The heroine does not like herself.<br /><br />  Over and over again the heroine puts herself down while repeatedly making the same mistakes.  She is a poor public speaker, but rather than avoid public speaking or get coaching she continually makes a fool of herself and this is supposed to be what is lovable about her.  I think that we can all identify with not doing things well, but Jones repeatedly bashes herself in the movie.  She calls herself a spinster and has several \\"Bridget has done it again\\" moments.  I think that there is a good argument that woman are being pressured to be so successful that any woman actually attempting to work and be glamorous and intelligent and do everything correctly will eventual have doubts about her abilities, but this film makes fun of heroine.  We aren't to question whether society has an expectation for women now that they cannot meet, we are simply supposed to laugh at this protagonist for failing all the time. A single woman struggling is now hilarious?<br /><br />  Another problem is that at 30 her life does not resemble the typical 30 year old's.  She has no children. Utterly no dependents. Virtually no responsibility yet she cannot perform her job. How many female incompetent bachlorettes do you know? We are supposed to identify with her because she wears baggy underwear when she wants to be sexy.  Bridget tries to be a playgirl but doesn't know how.  She is too stupid.  The underlying message that I get is that no woman is really able to enjoy casual sex; she must mess it up, not enjoy it, or be mocked for her attempts.  Another issue is that Bridget wants a relationship, but is messing around with what in layman's terms we call an absolute jerk.  She is so despite for a man that she accepts Grant even though his behavior is disrespectful to her in the extreme.  He sexually harasses her at work and she does not leave or feel outraged. I find that believable if she was younger, but at 30 most women have a more experience with men and understand the workings or a relationship were as a young woman may not.<br /><br />  The problem with Darcy is that he is not very nice to her.  He insults her and treats her in a condescending manner.  She doesn't fight back.  She makes a fool of herself and he feels bad for her.  That is not the novel that I read.  The point of Pride and Prejudice is that Mr. Darcy is prejudice and recognizes that he is reproducing social class discrimination when Elizabeth Bennett rejects him in a blunt, passionate, and outstanding way.  She stands up for herself beautifully when she exclaims that she will never marry him [because he is so disrespectful]. There are no scenes like this in this movie. Darcy looks down on her much like a Ph.D scholar degrades a fast food worker, and Bridget in the end runs through the streets in her underwear so despite that he not leave her. After he treats her poorly, the best way that she can express herself in written word is to pen that she hates him in her diary.  She doesn't state way she hates him or why his disdainful attitude towards her hurts her.<br /><br />  All problems stated, the worst is that Bridget isn't in a relationship because she met someone that she has an affinity.  She is in a relationship because she is afraid to be single.  She sings all by myself and eats too much ice cream because being alone is embarrassing. It is her social status and not her personal loneliness that is the root of the problem. Ultimately, this movie teaches woman that above all else they must get a man if they are going to be acceptable members of society and that you should do anything--run in your underwear in the snow if you must, nothing is too shameful, to keep him!one is embarrassing.

B000KLRUJS|5.0|Elektra is a masterpiece the effect of which is very difficult to articulate. When done really well, it is just overwhelming. You will be in tears, you will scream; its power is really astonishing. This performance deserves every bit of praise given it by the other reviewers. I won't go on, other than to say that if you love this opera, you can't be without this.     Ordinarily, I'm not a great fan of Nilsson the singer, though I thought Nilsson the person was a fabulous character (I've seen her interviewed many times, and she was smart and FUNNY). Yes, she had vocal power of the rarest kind, but was it beautiful? I think her Turandot is just awful, In Questa Reggia sung without a clue about the shape and beauty of Puccini's music. But somehow, this is different. Perhaps it's the influence of Solti, another irresistible force, who just made her sing the Recognition Scene (one of those incomparable Strauss moments that will have tears running down your face, like the Presentation of the Rose and the final Trio from Rosenkavalier, or the last 10 minutes or so of Ein Heldenleben) with incredible tenderness.    Regina Resnik is a big star in this. I'm not a soprano, but Chrysothemus sounds almost as demanding as Elektra, and only Deborah Voight matches Resnik in this role, in my experience.    But I think the ultimate credit goes to Solti. He's sometimes written off as a bulldozer (I remember a review in the NY Times of a guest-conducting stint with the NY Philharmonic, in which he was accused of turning the orchestra into an \\"assault weapon\\") and I think there have been times when it was deserved (some of his Chicago performances of the Mahler 5th were amazing orchestral playing but had nothing to do with Mahler). But in this, I think he's found a near-perfect balance between intensity and lyricism.    I would add that the recorded sound is wonderful, and this recording was made many, many years ago. They knew something about recording in 1967.

0743455967|5.0|I liked this book the best for writing and what it takes to write. On Writing, does not waist time on the silly ten and fifteen minute writing exercises. On Writing tells the truth of what it realy takes to get writing done. King does not cut corners or simplify the pain of what writing can be.  This book is also fairly entertaining as King goes through some of his own experiences.  This is an excelent book for anyone who is dreaming of writing, or is intrested in what writers may truly be like.
0385504225|4.0|My favorite book of Brown's is Angels and Demons, and it still is.<br /><br />When I opened this book, within the first few pages, I was concerned. What concerned me? That this novel was written like a movie script. Some of the way Brown describes people's reactions and actions sounded like something straight out of a script. But I continued to read on, and frankly, I was highly entertained. I loved the suspense, the campy-ness of the characters and really didn't take it that seriously.  The theories, whether based in fact or fiction, were interesting.  I really couldn't put it down.<br /><br />I still gave the book 4 stars because it did what I expected it would - gave me an entertaining, suspenseful read.  could it have used more work and polish? absolutely. If you are looking for a great literary work, this isn't it. But if you are looking for a work of fiction that is altogether fun, this is it. Don't read into it more than you should.
B002B55XGI|5.0|Great book.  I had a hard time putting it down and spent several nights at 3:00 am reading it.  A bit slow at the beginning, but gets fast paced quickly.  A lot of information on SEAL training and what they go through to become a Navy SEAL.  And a lot of thought provoking decisions to make by the SEAL team.  Puts in prospective exactly what faces our men in Afghanistan and fighting the Taliban.  A great story about true Heros!!

B000HKCRW2|1.0|I can't get rid of this, just because the single still makes it seem like Dangermouse had a reason for working with these guys on a track or two, even if the rest of the album does not defend that claim at all. It's like a puzzle I can't solve. I guess I'm OK with spending a dollar or two on a decent puzzle. Too bad though; I was hoping it would be worth real money.
0061719544|5.0|When I started to read this book I was not aware of the emotions it would bring to me.  I have also read Between the Bridge and the River and fell in love with that book too.  Ferguson proves himself to be a really good author and I hope we see more coming from his pen.  His story is told in a matter-of-fact way, very candidly, no excuses and I know too few people who can make that happen.  But as you read, you can see the emotions just beneath the surface.  I laughed, I cried and I want to read more from this guy!  Bravo, Craig Ferguson.  I applaud you.
0307277453|4.0|I never thought of myself as a fishy person.  I do not lurk in dark alleyways, or wear long trench coats, or dart from tree to tree.  I never thought of myself as a fishy person, that is, until I read Neil Shubin's book, Your Inner Fish.  Who knew that almost all parts of the human anatomy are linked, across hundreds of millions of years, to ancient fish or other unfamiliar creatures?  It sounds unbelievable, but Shubin provides the evidence and logic that links us all together and takes us on a fascinating and intelligible, albeit somewhat disorganized, trip through our past.   Your Inner Fish begins though, with the basics.  It describes Shubin's profession as a paleontologist (someone who studies fossils) and through personal anecdotes, portrays how Shubin becomes interested in the connections he writes about.  He first warms the reader up to the thought that the reader's wrist bones originate from a historic fish. Although this may sound abstract to most people, the author moves slowly and ties in his personal discovery of the Tiktaalik, the fish that is proof of his claim, into the chapter. His specific examples are used to break up more complex scientific concepts. It is a refreshing break to hear about Shubin's expeditions, after reading through his new and foreign ideas.  From these personal anecdotes, the reader learns of Shubin's enthusiasm and knowledge in his field.  The chapters at the beginning of the book allow the reader to gradually become acclimatized to the level of science expressed throughout Your Inner Fish. As the chapters progress though, they focus more and more on the analogies of our anatomy and that of our peculiar precursors'.  As the book gets more detailed about parts of our bodies that used to belong to fish and reptiles, even biology majors, namely myself, are surprised at what once belonged to something else.  You would probably never guess where the bones in our middle ear come from or what a simple patch of cells can do.  I was taken aback when I discovered that a cluster of cells transferred from where it usually resides to a different location in the body creates an extra eye, a mirror image hand or even a twin organism! At this point the book becomes a bit more technical.  Even as a biology major, I have not heard many of the terms used. Yet, I am only a biology major and do not study fossils or embryos.  Therefore, I am not familiar with much of the terminology associated with these fields.  Yet even with my lack of knowledge, Shubin weaves together his claims and explanations with just enough science so that I can understand the main idea, without getting bogged down in all the jargon.  Although Your Inner Fish allows all levels of readers to understand its science, it also is a riveting read, for those who are trained in the sciences.  Yet, scientists adhere to a strict method of experimentation and should not read or write anything without this method in mind.  Taking this into consideration, the reader asks if he or she can really believe what Shubin is telling him or her?  Are these shocking claims facts? Are we really derived from the things we eat? As far as I can tell, yes.  Shubin not only teaches at an accredited and well-known university, but provides the names of the scientists who either discover, by fossil excavations or DNA experiments, the connections between people and predecessors.  His diligent citing of scientists at the end of the book, allows the skeptic to verify whether or not Shubin can be trusted. The author also walks his reader through the process of the scientific method.  In one example, he retells the thought process that scientists go through to achieve their astounding discoveries.   Another aspect of this book is evolution.  The sound methods of the researchers in Your Inner Fish, as well as the hard proof, in the fossil record, of transitional animals, lend strong support to evolution.  Since the language in this book is suited to the general public, those who are unfamiliar with this aspect of science can become acquainted with it.  Shubin does not force evolution on his reader, but instead suggests evolution as really the only explanation to the associations between humans and discoveries made in fossils DNA.  Shubin's Your Inner Fish seems to be without fault.  It is generally well organized and covers almost all major aspects of the human body and how it is related to fish (or other ancient life-forms). Each individual chapter is also divided into sections, which offers the reader a preview of the material the section will cover.  Sections also help the reader focus on the new ideas presented, instead of getting caught up on previously discussed material.  Yet, in the middle of the book, the author's elegant combination of writing and science leaves him.  Unfortunately, it leaves him quite completely.  In the chapter titled, \\"Adventures in Bodybuilding\\", Shubin loses his train of thought.  The chapter is about how bodies develop out of single-celled organisms. At the end of one section, he hints at the topic of the next section, only to talk about an abstract concept, seemingly unrelated to the topic of that section and never gets to his point.  This is rather frustrating and a theme throughout the chapter.  His repetitive nature in this chapter leads to the suspicion that he does not have an answer for \\"how\\" or \\"why\\" bodies develop from single-celled organisms.  In spite of Neil Shubin's hiccups in this one chapter, the overall impression of Your Inner Fish was one of substance.  The topics are covered thoroughly; the book is well written with a fun tone, courtesy of Shubin's enthusiasm for what he studies. It educates and surprises the reader and proves (or gets as close to proving as something can with science) that many, if not all, of our characteristics stem from fish and other ancient creatures.  No doubt, it is a strange circle of life, that when we are eating a fish stick dinner, we are actually eating a distant relative.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|I've liked all the version of Peter Pan made over the years (such as Hook, and more recently P.J. Hogan's Peter Pan), but Disney's 1953 version will always be my favorite. I've loved this movie since I was a young, and I still enjoy watching it today. The music is terrific, the animation is beautiful, and (despite what others may think) wonderfully depicts J.M. Barrie's classic novel about a boy who would not grow up. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys classic Disney films and/or the original novel.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This is a great set !! Highly recommended !! It looks so clear !! The Godfather looks good in blu !!!
1416550542|5.0|This book is a must read. The book jumps arund from year 1913 to 2005 but is easy to follow. The story line is great about a girl left on a boat at the age of four a man finds her takes her in and raises her as there own. I don't want to say to much more it would give it away. but I must say it is one of the best books I have read in a long time. You are able to put this book down if needed and pick it back up and still be able to know what is going on.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I am glad I stuck with this show. It just got better and better as the season progressed.  The last 2 episodes in particular were fantastic. I was very happy to see that Fringe  got renewed for a second season.  -Al
031604461X|3.0|I haven't read the novel yet because I wanted to wait and keep my anticipation alive. The third book was soo good that it left me wating more and at the same time confused. What I got from the book was that Bella had feelings for Jacob yet she was in love with Edward and was kind of  questioning if she wanted to get married and becoming a vampire. In the third book we learned that they can't be intimate because of Edwards Strenght. So what I don't understand is how are they able to be intimate in the last book and at the same time conceive a child? This book has really killed my anticipation. So far what i think from reading all the reviews is that SM was really sloopy creating a great ending for such a wonderful love story.
0547258305|5.0|This book was recommended to me by my local bookstore and it turned out to be a fantastic read! One that I gave up my sleep for, which hasn't happened in a while. The writing, the plot, the characters all added up nicely for an enjoyable trip into another world. If you're a Twilight fan, you'll love this book. [...].
B000641Z90|5.0|This artist is superlative and for whatever defects in recording a live concert-which i think are few-the pure energy of this outstanding drummer translates well and makes up for any asserted  technical defects in this DVD-while I can appreciate that the bonus videos from the '80's are in stereo only because of the technology of the time -it sure would be nice for these to be put into the Dolby or DTS 5.1 or above surround format-when this is played on a blu rayplayer with HD it is amazingly crisp and clear-if anyone does not know the solo Phil Collins -this is definitely the place to start
B000063E63|5.0|A very good vinyl, despite it only has 3 tracks this record has some great beats! the remix made by Fatboy Slim... superb, if you think the chemical has the greatest beats, this remix is gonna like you, very well designed, and H.I.A. at first you feel it slow but when the first minute pass, you feel the rush and that feeling of dancing no matter where you are! If you are a Chemical fan like me, buy it, it's a must have, if not... doesn't matter buy it!
1601251505|5.0|This is an update of 3.5, published under Paizo in order to continue to support OGL.  Since it is a Paizo product it can be made available as a .pdf which allows you to purchase a legal copy for $10.  The core races have been given a slight bump in power, making them have about a +1 level adjustment by 3.5 standards, which increases survivability at low levels without substantially impacting higher level dynamics.  The core classes have been rebalanced to remove dead levels and give players a reason to play a 20th level fighter, as well as evening out the power imbalance between the core classes and the base classes in the 'splatbooks' (most noticeably the Warlock).  Sorcerers now get very characterful bloodline options, fighters can eventually move unhindered in heavy plate, Wizards are no longer condemned to throwing darts or firing crossbows when they're out of spells (instead getting an equivalent magical ability that can be used ~3-4+INT mod times a day, based on specialization).  The combat maneuver system streamlines unusual combat actions like grappling, which is a big help for players that don't want to just hit things with a longsword and certain combat feats allow maneuvering without sacrificing all your damage potential.  The skill list has been refined while still offering a wide array of choices, including professions and class skills (as well as a feat explaining how Dwarf smiths can make magical weapons and armor without being mages.  Seriously). Physically, the book is well laid out and has high production values.  It is largely compatible with any 3.5 products you have on your shelves already, which is a fact I've been taking heavy advantage of.  My only complaint is that they haven't split the players sections into a stand-alone player's guide at a lower cost, but with the .pdf being so cheap and the abundance of netbooks and laptops this is a minor complaint.

B002C6K7N0|5.0|It is very hard for bands/artists to stand the test of time, no matter from what part of the musical spectrum. While there are many bands that never quite made it there are those that have been around going on 30/40 years and we sometimes wonder why are they still here? Megadeth, Dave Mustanes' brainchild is one of the powerhouses who refuses to fall into that hole. This act has gone through so many changes for the past 26 years for better and for worse. Still speck of truth can be said about Megadeth, they are not finished.<br /><br />'The World Needs A Hero' was only the begining of a whole new life for this godfather of thrash. Of course there are so many other things that fueled Mustane's fire, but he has been able to evolve with the music scene and the ever changing world. 'Endgame' is just as heavy as it is significant. One step higher than 'United Abominations' the musician ship is amazing and the songs are an exciting adreniline rush one after the other. Since 2000 Megadeth has been living in it's golden years they are harder and edgier than ever before. Endgame is a must have for any Megadeth fan both new and old and believe me when I say don't be fooled by this albums title. Thanks to this past decade Megadeth's run is far from over.
1851774394|5.0|I really like this book as I did the other book in the Fashion in Detail series.  These books are not designed as tutorial, but more inspirational.  They are total eye candy.  If you deal with authentic, reproduction period costumes, can't do without them for their closeups on details and line drawings of designs.  Fabrics can be seen closeup as well as stitches and, as I said before, the tiny details.  I highly recommend this book if you have patterns, because it great for research and inspiration.
B001VPJYZK|5.0|Smart, funny,twisted, with really scary and crazy people in it...Welcome back to Desperate Housewives' world ! Defenitively better than the second season, as good as the third one I think, with two nostalgic episodes, where you can see some of the actors of the first season. Excellent ! Hope the next one will be the same :)
0143116371|4.0|Great fashion inspiration photos, I love Scott Schuman's blog and this book is a reflection of his awesome eye and showcases his subjects' individual style. I am a fan of street style and Schuman does it best in my opinion. I actually brought my book to work today to get some ideas for my Fall fashion style. Ideal for those who love fashion photography!
0385504225|1.0|It seemed like Dan Brown did a lot of research on the Masons and his entire desire with this book was to give you a history of this not so secret society.  With that said, I kept reading to see if there was a big payoff in the end. I literally closed the book when I got to the page when they explain why the CIA was involved.  I couldn't read another page.  SPOILER ALERT(sort of)....when Langdon learned why the CIA was so concerned I nearly laughed out loud. PLEASE!!  At least in his previous books he didn't think that the cover-up by the church was warranted, but in this he is just as worried as the CIA that this news will get out. CHAOS!!!! A political scandal that would rock the entire foundation of the United States. Please.  I felt like a fool for not at least waiting for paperback version before I tried this book, or borrowing it from the library. better yet, just take a pass a read a good book.  Dan Brown, you just made yourself a lot of money for a piece of garbage.
B001GCUO1Q|3.0|Having known Wolverine since his first appearance in The Incredible Hulk issue #181, which I bought at my local magazine store for 25 cents! I know official issue #180 is the first appearance, but one panel hardly counts as an appearance. 'X-Men Origins Wolverine' is bound to raise a few eyebrows on hard core fans because of the reworking of the original story. Origins are tough with super heroes because they try to squeeze 20 to 80 years of hero history into a film that runs two hours or less.<br /><br />I enjoyed Wolverine for the most part, but I was confused at times not knowing some of the heroes from their comic counter parts on screen. The action sequences are very cool and the story moves along smoothly for the most part, but in the end it seemed like it could have been better. It's not the worst super hero film, but it's not the best either. I liked the X-Men movies, but none of them are as well thought out as any on the Spider-Man films...yes including Spider-Man 3!<br /><br />The single disc edition has the movie and some trailers so for fans of the character I think you might want to buy the two discs edition. The DVD transfer looks very good!
B001B1T7BU|3.0|I received the DVD very quickly but it won't play a couple of chapters and it skips some.

B002ELM5HY|5.0|I must admit I'm a fan (not a tourist!). I remember the first time I heard Sultans, all the concerts and the great music over the last thirty years, the poetry, the guitar playing and the man himself. So what about Get Lucky, best track, for me, So Far From The Clyde.   The music from Mark is maturing with the years and this album proves just that, every track has something to say, there is no filling here, track after track is special.    Thanks Mark
B000G1ALRK|5.0|To think only a few weeks ago, I'd never even heard of, Eric Church.  I happened across one of his videos on Youtube, and decided to check it out.  Liked what I heard, and watched a few more.  The next day I purchased the CD.<br /><br />I was hoping to like at least half the CD, but every song is great.  Great beat, AMAZING words, and a wonderful soothing voice.<br /><br />The next time I go to the store, I plan on picking up his other CD.  Can't get enought.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Okay, I think I hear you loud and clear MONO fans: I am not allowed to enjoy the stereo mixes because they were created by janitors at Abbey Road long after the Beatles left the studio. The Beatles themselves knew nothing of the existence of these stereo mixes. In fact, the Beatles have never even heard the word \\"stereo\\" until sometime in 1973. (George Martin, of course, knew about stereo all along but kept it a secret from the Beatles. In fact, he told Geoff Emerick: \\"you mention stereo around them even once and I will slap you into next week, now go get me some tea.\\")  So, MONO fans, from now on I will listen to these albums only in MONO and I will do so in the purest way possible: facing the speakers (or just one speaker, I guess, why would I need two?), sitting in my chair without slouching, with my eyes closed, thinking only pure MONO thoughts,and chanting to myself:  mmmm, crispy,mmmm, punchy. I hope that keeps MONO Police from knocking on my door. Wait, was that a knock? Oh, #^@&....
0061245097|5.0|Amazing addition to the series.I loved reading about all the characters,as in the first book there was humor,action and romance.Bones and Cat just steams the pages when they come together. loved it<br />I must say this series has moved to number 1 in my must read list,moving Twilight to my # 2 spot thats how great these books are....

B001AQTWF2|1.0|I knew from the moment they started heavy rotation of 'I Turn To You' on the radio that there would be nothing new.  I am happy that she has made a successful return and that she has gotten herself together.  However, I'm still bored.  I only found one song that I like which is her duet with Akon for 'Like I Never Left'.  The rest is the same beat.  Its obvious Clives' hands are all over this cd like ALL of the others.  I have only been able to appreciate snippets of Whitney. She has a tremendous talent but for me its a bit limited.  Need more from her than the redundancy of the same beat.  That's my story and I'm sticking to it.
0385504225|2.0|Way too boring. Just when you think things are about to take off you have a crash landing of disappointment. Dan Brown knew that he could pile a bunch of gunk into this one and that it would still fly of off the shelves, but he shot himself in the foot for future releases.
1439157383|1.0|Ugh. I  spent a gazillion hours reading this book. And those are hours that I am never going to get back,unfortunately.<br /><br />First of all, any good hospital would have put a stop to the sort of  treatments that the younger daughter Anna, had to go through to save the life of her sister Kate who has leukemia. She is a child concieved to give her sister a match for bone marrow that she needs. People were horrified when her parents concieved her for that purpose. And then after suing her parents to be emancipated so she does not have to donate bone marrow ,in the end<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br /> she's killed in a car accident and Kate gets  Anna's kidney.<br /><br />Oh and can we talk about the cornball dialogue?Especially Campell's responses every time someone asks him why he has a guide dog(he's an epileptic-and he drives,he became a epileptic because of-oh irony- a car accident. Ane yet he still har a drivers licence? whut?)
B00275EHCI|3.0|First off, I'm happy to say that Surrogates was much better than I thought it would be. I didn't plan on seeing it in theaters, but I was bored today and the reviews haven't been too harsh. There is a lot more going on here than in most of the mindless drivel that comes out this time of the year. Sure there are some nifty action scenes, but this movie plays more like a drama with sci-fi elements and some thought provoking ideas on humanity. It's a little slow at times, but at around 90 minutes, it doesn't overstay it's welcome.<br /><br />Bruce Willis is solid here as usual. Nothing really special from him, but he's still the guy we know and love. The supporting cast features two beautiful women in Radha Mitchell and Rosamund Pike. Not only are they nice to look at, they make the most of the limited material they are given. I thought it was pretty funny how the filmmakers made all the actors so attractive as the robots and went out of their way to make them as ugly as possible in human form. Except for Bruce Willis curiously, who just looked flat out creepy as a Surrogate. Ving Rhames and James Cromwell add name recognition to the cast and perform rather well in their small roles.<br /><br />The SFX are good at times and lacking at others, but nothing too bad or distracting. There is one neat twist I didn't see coming and the ending felt just right. Not too optimistic or depressing. I saw Gamer a few weeks ago and it shares a lot of similarities with this one, but Surrogates is a much stronger film with bigger ideas. I wouldn't rush out to see it, but this flick is worth a rental, especially if you enjoyed I, Robot or The Island.
B000O77SOK|1.0|When I request this series, I wanted all eight season but only received volume One. I selected seasons 1-8 on Amazon site and the Volume One appeared for $14.99. I thought I was getting a great deal since The Practice has been off air fo r some years, so i purchased this volume one hoping to receive all eight seasons, but I was fooled, and disappointed. I haven't watched this DVD as of yet and do not know if I will. I just waisted some money on something I do not want anymore.
1594489505|5.0|the book was in a good condition when I rreceived as described by the seller. I couldn't believe it's not brand new, It seems as if no one has touched before. Beside that I'm fan of this author's work. Finally, thank you and I'll advise my friends to buy from the this seller if he/she has what they are looking for.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I have been getting to know these new remasters over the last couple of weeks and reading the countless and widely divergent reviews and comments by professional critics and online purchasers alike. Although the familiar content of the music is far too embedded to warrant further comment, listening to their eight-year development over this short period it was particularly striking how great George Martin's contributions were. No-one doubts his role as producer, particularly the embellishments he was able to bring to their music through the judicious use of sound effects and technical know-how, and his ability to square the circle when asked the impossible, such as when John Lennon asked him to combine two very different versions of Strawberry Fields Forever into a coherent single piece of music. It is also known that he has added keyboard support to some of their work, but I think his playing, which includes the notable piano on tracks such as You've Really Got A Hold On Me, Money, Rock And Roll Music, Long Tall Sally and Slowdown, has been considerably underestimated. His arrangements and scores for tracks such as Eleanor Rigby are also quite exemplary.<br /><br />The sound quality of these remasters is also testament to the skills of the engineers Norman Smith, Geoff Emerick, Ken Scott, Phil McDonald and Glyn Johns on equipment that was quite primitive by today's standards, particularly on the twin-track machines that were in use on the early albums and singles.<br /><br />These new CDs do always sound better than the previous editions, though sometimes the differences are quite subtle. They should not be compared to the American Capitol label releases as these were often remixed with superficially exciting added reverb. The purpose of these remasters is to get the best possible results from the existing master by repairing physical damage and bad edits, adding low-end frequencies, removing amplifier hum, clicks, pops and sibilance; but not compromising the musical performance in any way. It does not involve any remixing. The remastering was done using 192 kHz/24-bit technology, paving the way for DVD-A/SACD/HDCD releases, but the current box set is in standard resolution CD format. It has been done with a lot of scrupulous attention to detail and is undoubtedly a labour of love for all concerned.<br /><br />For most of the tracks, this is the first time they have been remastered since the first CD releases in 1987, the exception being the number one singles that made up the compilation album One. There have also been remixes - these occur on the Anthology series, the Yellow Submarine Songtrack, the Love project and the DVD re-issue of the film HELP! with 5.1 audio. The remixes have all been released additionally to the standard catalogue, whereas it looks as if these stereo remasters will supercede the previous editions. This is interesting as the CDs of the first four albums were previously in mono, whereas the CDs in the new mono box set are not available individually.<br /><br />Please Please Me was their first album, originally released in March 1963. Mostly recorded in one day in February 1963 on a twin-track machine, it did include their two singles to date, Love Me Do/PS I Love You and Please Please Me/Ask Me Why, both recorded in 1962 (though Love Me Do is a different take to the one on the original single). Love Me Do/PS I Love You has never appeared in any form other than mono in the UK, and this is again the case here.<br /><br />The rest of the album, and all of With The Beatles, is not actually true stereo either. George Martin simply separated the recording onto two tracks using customized existing EMI equipment, so that he could better balance the final, mono product. Nothing sent to the left channel is heard in the right, apart from minor incidental sound leakage, whereas for anything to be heard centrally it would have to be sent to both left and right channels. That's why in 1987, when the albums appearedon CD, he requested of EMI that the first four be issued only in mono. By then he had even forgotten that the twin-track \\"stereo\\" versions had ever been released commercially on vinyl Parlophone LPs. Stereo was an insignificant, specialist market in those days.<br /><br />The twin-track channel separation creates a hole in the middle of the sound stage, which is especially unnatural sounding when listened to binaurally on headphones, as each ear only hears one channel. With loudspeakers, both ears hear both channels and the effect is less marked, especially if the speakers are placed close to each other, or one on top of the other. The twin-channel sound does provide the greater clarity afforded by each speaker relaying different information and is an enhancement in my view.<br /><br />The albums A Hard Day's Night and Beatles For Sale were recorded on a new four-track desk, which the Beatles had first used to record the single I Want To Hold Your Hand, and so are true stereo, although mixed in a way that modern ears, used to drums and vocals in the centre and other instruments and percussion to the left and right, can find unconventional. The remasters are presented here exactly in the same format as heard on the Parlophone stereo albums. A Hard Day's Night remains the only Beatles album to feature exclusively Lennon-McCartney compositions, as George Harrison unusually takes the lead vocal on a Lennon-McCartney song, I'm Happy Just To Dance With You. He also did not get one of his own songs onto Beatles For Sale, instead covering Carl Perkins' Everybody's Trying To Be My Baby.<br /><br />The stereo mixes of HELP! and Rubber Soul were judged by George Martin to be unsuitable when he reviewed them for CD release, consequently they were both remixed by him for the 1987 releases on CD, so claims that the Yellow Submarine Songtrack was the first time the Beatles had been remixed now seem incorrect. It is the 1987 remixes that have been remastered for the 2009 releases, as George Martin wished. However, it was deemed important to keep the original 1965 mixes also in catalogue and so they have been added to the mono CDs of those two albums in the mono box set. Most of the 1965 mixes are also available on the US box set The Capitol Albums (Vol. 2).<br /><br />Rubber Soul and Revolver are presented here in their UK tracklist versions, the last of the Beatles albums to differ from their US counterparts. Revolver was followed in the UK by a compilation entitled A Collection Of Oldies... But Goldies. It contained mainly singles, adding Michelle from Rubber Soul and Bad Boy, previously unreleased in the UK, from the 1965 US album Beatles VI. It was never released on CD and is not included in the box set, though every track on it is represented on the discs.<br /><br />Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band was put together on a four-track tape machine over nine months (700 hours of recording) at Abbey Road (one track at Regent Sound). Although stereo was gaining in prominence by this time, several of the stereo mixes were made without the Beatles presence, and after the mono mixing had been completed, so it is the mono album that was considered standard at the time. There are notable differences between the two, ranging from speed variations to alternative overdubbing, editing and playing times. The album was completed in April 1967, by which time they had already begun working on tracks that would appear in the TV film Magical Mystery Tour and in the animated feature film Yellow Submarine, including All You Need Is Love.<br /><br />Magical Mystery Tour was released as an EP package with a lavish booklet and two three-track singles, but in the US, where EPs were less popular, it was expanded into an album by adding various singles. It was this expanded album that was added to the Beatles UK CD canon in 1987, and this piece of revisionist history has been repeated in this box set. That the extra tracks include Strawberry Fields Forever, Penny Lane, Hello Goodbye, Baby You're A Rich Man and All You Need Is Love, and that all the new material for Yellow Submarine (apart from Hey Bulldog) was completed the same year, shows what an extraordinary creative roll they were on in 1967, especially if you appreciate psychedelic music.<br /><br />I Am The Walrus incorporates a radio feed that was fed live into a mono mix during its final two minutes, therefore the stereo version has always turned \\"duophonic\\" at that point, and still does. There is otherwise no fake stereo to be found on this box set. Whereas some of the vinyl album's extra tracks contained \\"duophonic\\" stereo mixes as true ones did not yet exist, these were replaced by the true stereo mixes (prepared later in 1968 and in 1971) on the 1987 CD and on these remasters.<br /><br />The Beatles double album (generally known as the White Album) marked the transition from four-track in May 1968 to eight-track from the end of August. The Beatles began the White Album, including the remarkable John and Yoko avant-garde piece of musique concr&egrave;te Revolution 9, on four-track, but had been discovering the joys of eight-track while producing other Apple artists at Trident Studios. They began briefly recording there themselves until they discovered an eight-track desk had newly arrived at another part of the Abbey Road EMI studios, which they immediately requisitioned for their own use. The first Abbey Road recording with the new desk was While My Guitar Gently Weeps in September 1968. Some of the  mixing of the completed tracks for mono and stereo masters was done side by side at the same sessions, but again with notable differences between the two versions of the album. Whatever the virtues of the mono mix, however, hearing something like Helter Skelter screeching through two stereo speakers is an experience I wouldn't want to miss.<br /><br />The next album to be released was Yellow Submarine, held back from the release of the film for several months to avoid clashing with the White Album. The Beatles had side one of the album, while the George Martin Orchestra had George Martin's orchestral score for the film on the second side. Previously-released singles Yellow Submarine and All You Need Is Love book-ended side one. Yellow Submarine had also been on Revolver, and All You Need Is Love  also appeared on the US Magical Mystery Tour album in a slightly different mix.<br /><br />The four new tracks were George's Only A Northern Song, a Sgt. Pepper outtake; Paul's All Together Now, recorded during the Magical Mystery Tour sessions but always intended for Yellow Submarine; as was John's Hey Bulldog, recorded more recently in February 1968. The fourth number was George's magnificent six-minute exultation It's All Too Much, which also dates from the Magical Mystery Tour sessions, but at studios in Kingsway. Another song written for the film, Baby You're A Rich Man, was somewhat perversely missed off the album because it had already appeared as the B-side of All You Need Is Love (included).<br /><br />The UK mono album of Yellow Submarine was simply a reduction of the stereo mix. This was unusual for Parlophone, but common practice for Capitol, which causes me to wonder if this was an American put-together album that got released in the UK, rather than the other way around. Also unusual, and showing the Beatles' relative disinterest in the project, is that no stereo mix had been made for Only A Northern Song and so a fake stereo version appeared on the album (and on the 1987 CD). This was used as the source for the 1969 mono album, rather than the original mono master. A stereo remix was finally prepared and appears on the Yellow Submarine Songtrack, released in 1999. The version here is mono, but as the true mono mix has been used on the mono box set I would hope that that has also been used here.<br /><br />Abbey Road and Let It Be were both released in the UK and the US as stereo-compatible-mono albums in 1969 and 1970and so are not included in the mono box set (although mono mixes were prepared, and mono albums released in some countries where stereo had yet to take hold). Abbey Road and Let It Be both benefit more than I would have expected from the new remastering. Let It Be of course pre-dates Abbey Road in recording date terms, and was conceived as a basic warts-and-all no overdubs live-in-the-studio project, but the mix prepared by Glyn Johns was never released and the tapes were controversially remixed, overdubbed and released posthumously (to the life of the Beatles) by Phil Spector, who ignored the basic premise of the project by adding orchestras and choirs. Abbey Road is a masterpiece and a far more fitting swansong for the band, beautifully recorded and sequenced, and has never sounded better.<br /><br />Finally, in this marathon box, comes the 2CD Past Masters, combining the two CDs of that name released in 1988, collecting all the various singles, EPs, B-sides and stray tracks not to be found on their regular albums, a most diverse collection of tracks, from their earliest EMI recording to be released, the red-label single version of Love Me Do with Ringo on drums, to the frankly bizarre whimsy of You Know My Name (Look Up The Number), originally destined for Yellow Submarine. There had been much speculation before release as to what might turn up here, and there are variants from the masters selected for the 1988 editions. Love Me Do is unsurprisingly mono, but From Me To You and Thank You Girl make their CD debut in their UK stereo mixes, with some interesting variations from the familiar mono ones.<br /><br />Stereo mixes were prepared for She Loves You and I'll Get You but these have long been lost, and so are still mono. The rest of CD1 is all stereo, including Komm, Gib Mir Deine Hand [I Want to Hold Your Hand] and Sie Liebt Dich [She Loves You], previously mono.<br /><br />Past Masters CD2 includes the original single versions of Get Back and Let It Be, both as prepared by Glyn Johns (along with b-side Don't Let Me Down) and not re-touched by Phil Spector. The pre-Phil Spector version of Across The Universe which Spike Milligan blagged for issue on the World Wildlife Fund charity compilation No One's Gonna Change Our World is also included. You Know My Name (Look Up The Number) seems not to have been released in stereo and is still in mono. The four mono tracks on Past Masters are therefore duplicated on Mono Masters in the mono box set.<br /><br />The stereo box set also includes enhanced video sections on each CD and a 40-minute DVD which collects all these mini-documentaries.<br /><br />Whilst these remasters are a vital part of the EMI Beatles catalogue and do full justice to the original masters, I look forward to future higher-resolution remixes, in the manner of the Yellow Submarine Songtrack, especially of the earlier catalogue. I do not doubt these will follow at some stage.ll the new material for Yellow Submarine (apart from Hey Bulldog) was completed the same year, shows what an extraordinary creative roll they were on in 1967, especially if you appreciate psychedelic music.

0439023491|5.0|WHAT???? what do you mean i have to wait a year to find out what happens in the 3 book????? that is totally unfair....hahaha- i am just kidding- this is a wonderful series- i highly recommend it to everyone- young and old.<br />i do hate to have to wait a year for the next book- i really do- but i will- i waited all those years to get all the Harry Potter books- i guess i will have to wait again for these....<br />Keep up the wonderful work, Ms. Collins- these books are AWESOME!@!@!
B0011N1WE8|5.0|I found the book form a couple years ago at my library and waited and waited for the movie to come out, having thoroughly enjoyed the book.  Never got my hands on it, so took a chance the movie would be as good as the bk and bought it sight unseen.  I was not disappointed.  If you like fantasy, romance and humor, you can't go wrong with this light-hearted movie.  (And the book is well worth it, too.)
B00004T9UF|5.0|I wish that eminem would do another album like this. The album is so hilarious and fun to listen too. You could really tell how hungry eminem was because the lyrics were so strong and the flow was so smooth. If your a person that likes to hear about chaos and Destruction than this is the album for you.
B002OSAT7U|5.0|It's not quite as brilliant as Random Album Title but its up there.  My favs are Moar Ghosts N Stuff, GnS sub focus remix (got so addicted to that song on GTA4), Bot, and Lack of a Better Name.    Joel, if your listening, please release the hour long mix I think is called Electric Zoo.  I heard it on XM the other day while I was stuck in traffic for an hour and it made gridlock pleasurable.  Maybe make At Play downloadable too, discs are as dead for me as the A-Track.
1934030198|4.0|I bought this book in preparation for my first olympic distance triathlon and found it a bit too advanced for my needs.  I'd highly recommend it for anyone who is in top form for the olympic distance or doing ironmans, but it was so detailed I lost the forest for the trees in trying to make sure I was training effectively.    I was hoping for something a little simpler - \\"here's how you should think about your training and to know you're ready for the race (for me - that meant finishing without feeling like i was going to die.)\\"     Those nuggets are in there, but it's clearly directed for people who are competing at an elite level or is there to help people train for ironmans.  To that end, the book appears to be superb - very well thought out, and well laid out as well.     Jim
0385504225|4.0|This book is fun, just like most of Dan Brown's other books.  It is NOT a literary masterpiece, just like Dan Brown's other books.  It is fairly formulaic, JUST LIKE Dan Brown's other books.  But it's still fun!<br /><br />Anybody who buys this book looking for some sort of stunning piece of writing by a masterful author obviously has never read Dan Brown...it's like walking into the theater, watching \\"Transformers\\", then complaining that it wasn't \\"Citizen Kane\\".<br /><br />Sit back, relax, turn off your brain and enjoy the ride...
B001GCUO1Q|2.0|I'm a big fan of X-men/Wolverine, so I was excited about this movie.  Big disappointment.  In the first 5 minutes, we see a young Logan grow out little baby bony claws.  I immediately thought \\"uh oh\\", and boy was I right.  I waited for it to get better, but it never did.  Skip it.  Revisit the Wolverine/X-men franchise in 5-10 years when they get new actors (or when CGI can make Hugh Jackman look about 30-35 again).  Hugh's my age, and he seems like a great guy, but I'm too old to play Wolverine too.  You've been warned.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|Lost Symbol was a disappointment.  It's as though Dan Brown has conceived only one plot and, when he writes a new book, he changes the characters and the location but it's basically the same book.  This one takes place in Washington DC and, while it is full of interesting tidbits about DC landmarks, the story is repetitve, predictable and formulaic.
B00006690G|5.0|You could definitely tell that eminem isn't playing any games in this one, which I love so much. He takes on more serious topics,such as, his beef with his moms and his ex-wife kim but still adds some funny songs as well. My favorite song from the album is \\"Sing for the moment\\" and so are \\"Superman\\" and \\"Soldier.\\" This is a must have eminem album because the lyrics are great and so are the beats.
0470477237|5.0|A great read.<br />As a marketer whose company is taking steps into the social media world I appreciate Eric's clear and concise language and examples. When I've have the need to illustrate the \\"features and benefits\\" of social media to my team, I pick and choose valuable tidbits from Socialnomics to share with them, delivering \\"ah-ha\\" moments along the way. Thank you, Eric!!!!
1567184855|5.0|Journey of Souls is a MUST read for anybody. It doesn't matter how open you are to: Reincarnation, The Afterlife, etc. This book is truly amazing!    I only had a problem with his patients never seeing or meeting god. They could feel an overwhelming loving presence, however, they never met him. Usually in NDE's they go and meet god, but I guess I have to figure this one out myself.    Other than that, the book is very good. But, you have to have an understanding and interpretation of certain things in the book. The author comes off as vague most of the time, which leaves me befuddled.    Other than that by the book!
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|If you're a fan of Michael Jackson this is a must have. Only confusing thing is it's advertised as a four CD collection. I didn't realize they include a DVD. That was a great addition.
0060935464|5.0|What a beautiful book to read.  I believe this is the only book Harper Lee wrote and what a story she had to tell.    I knew very little about the storyline and anticipated racial tension and courtroom drama to be ever present.  While racial inequities was \\"an\\" underlying theme I found the story much more about a man standing for what is right and his children learning how great a man he was.  Tension, prejudices, and inequities are everywhere and Ms. Lee makes sure we see it in its full glory (e.g., educated vs. undereducated, rich vs. poor, wood's folk vs. town's folk, black vs. white, sick vs. healthy, the shy and reclusive vs. the curiosity of a child's mind, etc.).  We all live with these forces in our lives and our surroundings and let them exist without pause.  Atticus tried to stand in the middle and wear the shoes of the individuals on each side, guided by his belief that intrinsic good exist in most if not all.  He believed all of us just needed to understand the other's side to make it work.  Beautiful concept but a position that proves nearly tragic in Atticus' life.    As stated above, it's a beautiful book.  Harper Lee must have been born to write this book and she did a fantastic job.  Enjoy.
B002JM1VJG|5.0|With the possible exception of Michael Jackson during his prime, nobody made better music videos than Madonna. She stands as the most relevant female music icon of the 80's. And the way she accomplished all this is a combination of intelligence, attitude and pure blond ambition. Madonna constantly reinvented herself, never resting on her laurels and always pushed on into new territory both with her music and videos.     Burning Up and Lucky Star paved the way for Like A Virgin and Material Girl. Then on True Blue, she showed a much more mature side with songs like Papa Don't Preach, the haunting Live To Tell and the beautiful La Isla Bonita. Pushing the envelope even further with both music and videos, the time from '89-'91 is probably the peak of her career. Madonna's music, videos and concert performances were a force to be reckoned with.    Like A Prayer, Express Yourself, Vogue, Justify My Love. She made a brilliant album in 1990 called I'm Breathless that is an excellent record. A different style, but I think it is one of her top 3 albums of all the masterworks she has done over the last 26 years.    This video collection is complete by no means, but enjoy what is here. There are many, many gems and perhaps even a few waiting to be discovered.
B000001FK3|5.0|I live on the tip of Africa and grew up in the humid wilds of the KwaZulu Natal coast. In those long, strange days between school and university, (January 1978) I was idling away the time and wandered into a music store, where I found an album with a cover I fell in love with. It was called 'Naturally' by a bloke called JJ Cale. Mysterious, I thought. And I loved musical adventures. So I brought the record home and in the languid heat of a summer night, I opened the doors of my bedroom and sat under the stars while the needle hit the record and into that night came the most amazing sounds, straight from, I imagined the murky Louisiana swamps. By the time ''Magnolia' and 'Call the doctor' ended, I was lovesick for this JJ, and i still can't hear the tracks without my heart contracting. And I still save my precious moments with this music for when it's dark and hot and I am transported straight back to those days when everything seemed possible. I've loved everything he's done, but there's nothing like first love.
0312263511|4.0|I'm a big fan of Gene Cernan.  I haven't met him, of course, but I find something interesting about his demeanor, when I see him on documentaries or news reports. He seems at peace with himself, exudes confidence but, not in a cocky way. Which is the way it should be. This book is a fun read, its not filled with technical mumbo jumbo, and moves along steady. A must for \\"Apollo geeks\\", maybe not so for aeronautical engineers.<br />You pretty much get only the astronaut part of Cernan, he doesn't go into his personal life too much, not much melodrama, which is fine and I respect that because, these astronauts sacrificied family and friend in their quest for exploring. Almost all of them ended up divorced, a huge sacrifice. I couldn't have done it.<br />I, as a father of two girls, was touched by his expression of love for his daughter (on the moon itself). Terrific!<br />Also, Cernan comes across as a regular guy and not some brainiac we can't relate to, or talks down to you. He could be your neighbor, your softball team mate. And this from a man who walked on the moon ('nuff said), met with presidents and celebrities continously. I was a bit surprised to read his opinions on Buzz Aldrin (second man on the moon), I never knew that those opinions existed.<br /><br />Cernan went after his dream, \\"full throtle\\", and... reached the heavens. Thanks Geno!
B0015I2P0Y|5.0|When I got the album, I only listened to couple of songs. Mirrorball, grounds of divorce, the bones of you... that was all. I was a bit afraid to go forth and give it a try. But everyday I played one new song and it was a phenomenal and rewarding experience! This album is so rich, diverse, layered and polished with synths and bunch of traditional instruments, accompanied with his great voice. It's a masterpiece. Evokes real emotions and is a TRUE work of art. That is so rare nowadays, as we live in a world of copy&paste junk music.    I'd give it 10 stars if I could!
B002C6K7N0|4.0|I will start out by saying this is my least favorite lineup of Megadeth in a long time. They're still very good, but the lineups for The World Needs a Hero (my favorite) and United Abominations were better. Maybe live it will be a different story though. Glen Drover did a better job as lead guitarist in my opinion. It's becoming frustrating how often the lineup changes. Bring back David Ellefson and Jimmy Degrasso. I think this may be the reason why the album feels a bit unfocused. I think the music suffers if you keep changing the lineup for every album and I think some of the songs could have turned out better. Still, another solid effort from Megadeth.
B000PTYPAC|4.0|It's a good cd, not one that I would want to listen to over and over though.  Love her voice too!
B002QEDOG0|5.0|I enjoyed all of the stories within the main story.  It was a little too gory, though, in a few early scenes.  I'm a retired trauma nurse but I don't need it quite that realistic when I'm trying to unwind!  The plumbing scene was very...domestic...and sweet.  :-)
B001JDS7CU|5.0|This collection contains two of the best nature documentaries the BBC has ever produced. Planet Earth in 1080p is a breathtaking experience, and every time I watch it I notice new things and I am continuously amazed by the power and beauty of nature. David Attenborough is the perfect narrator (much better than Sigourney Weaver on the Discovery edition), and I honestly think there should be a law requiring all nature documentaries to be narrated by him. Earth: The Biography is also a wonderful series, though arguably not as good as Planet Earth. Narrated by Ian Stewart, Earth: The Biography travels around the globe explaining natural phenomena and the complex interplay of geological and natural wonders. Both of these, together, in high definition, are the pinnacle of nature documentaries.
B0029NY9YO|5.0|While I love Superhero films (and am as knowledgeable about Superman, Batman, and most of the Marvel heroes as any comic book fan from the 'Silver Age'), I admit I was unfamiliar with Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' graphic novel \\"Watchmen\\", before watching the big screen version. I only knew that it was a different 'spin' on the 'Justice Society/Justice League' chronology, involving a unique set of heroes and an alternate version of our reality.<br /><br />\\"Watchmen\\", the movie, is much, much, more, and stands, with \\"The Dark Knight\\", as the most provocative, unconventional, and brilliant reinventions of the genre, since Tim Burton 'reinvented' Batman, in the eighties.<br /><br />First off, it debunks the classic superhero 'origin' story. These are not noble scientists or rich philanthropists, who don costumes to hide their indentities and achieve their 'higher calling'...many of this group were cops, who, when criminals discovered wearing masks and costumes made it impossible to identify and prosecute them, donned masks, themselves, to do what the courts couldn't: exact justice. Most of these 'costumed heroes' had no 'special skills' other than as brawlers, and the confrontations with masked criminals had more of a carnival sideshow 'feel' than anything really heroic. And these 'heroes', being regular people, had all the human foibles; some were sadists, one heroine was a lesbian, another would be raped, and all had some degree of ego problems. Yet the public loved them, and when, in the 40s, a group banded together, they achieved the same kind of public adoration as the Justice Society would, in their world. As time passed, however, age and changing mores would create a 'changing of the guard'...one hero, Nite Owl (a variation of Batman), would retire, replaced by a technology geek (Patrick Wilson), who added 'toys' large and small, to enhance his skills; another (Carla Gugino) would be replaced by her daughter (Malin Akerman); the world's richest, most brilliant intellectual (Matthew Goode) would use his resources to enhance his abilities and create a nearly superhuman persona; a child abuse victim (Jackie Earle Haley) would don a cowl with ever-changing patterns, and become a hard-core 'Dirty Harry'-type vigilante...and the world's first true 'superpowered' hero (Billy Crudup) would appear, a man who, when accidently bathed in nuclear energy, lost his physical form, becoming a nude blue creature of nearly limitless power, but a fading understanding of humanity. Joined by the one 'carry-over' from the first generation, the handsome, if disgusting 'Comedian' (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), a new team is created...which is really where the movie begins!<br /><br />It is 1985, a caricatured version of Richard Nixon (Robert Wisden), is in his umpteenth term as President, the world is at the brink of nuclear war, and the 'superheroes', with the exception of Crudup's 'Dr. Manhattan', have been ordered to retire, following a carnage-fueled American 'victory' of the Vietnam war. Other than Haley ('Rorschach'), who went into hiding, everyone has complied, willingly...but when the Comedian is brutally murdered, and other ex-heroes are targeted, Rorschach suspects a far more sinister purpose than simply revenge, and tries, unsuccessfully, to get his former colleagues to join him in a search for answers. He was right, of course, and as we learn more about the heroes' lives and backstories, a truly riveting tale of ambition, morality, and 'greater good' emerges, that kept me 'hooked'. While I saw elements of Frank Miller's \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" on several occasions, I'd never seen a universe so carefully and logically 'fleshed out', onscreen, and it was simply stunning.<br /><br />I won't give away anything else about this remarkable film...only to recommend it, enthusiastically, if you love this kind of film as much as I do...You won't be disappointed!hew Goode) would use his resources to enhance his abilities and create a nearly superhuman persona; a child abuse victim (Jackie Earle Haley) would don a cowl with ever-changing patterns, and become a hard-core 'Dirty Harry'-type vigilante...and the world's first true 'superpowered' hero (Billy Crudup) would appear, a man who, when accidently bathed in nuclear energy, lost his physical form, becoming a nude blue creature of nearly limitless power, but a fading understanding of humanity.

0061537934|5.0|I bought this book for my husband to read, not sure that he would like it since he enjoys books about dogs that are non-fiction.  He loved the book and could not put it down.  I think he read the entire book in less than 3 days.  He insisted that I read it and I also fell in love with it.  Since it was such a wonderful book, he had me order several as Christmas presents for friends and colleagues.      I recommend this book to anyone, whether they are an animal lover or not.  it will truly touch the heart.
B001M4YZ90|5.0|this film went right to the top of my gerry butler film list.  i didnt know if i would like this or not, as i am not normally into gangster films, but this is such a laid back version of gangsters, but not the rough tough gangsters of old times, these are very slap happy comical soft gangsters, who often get things wrong and have a very funny way of trying to be tough.  i found all the main characters were all brilliant in their respective roles , especially gerry as one two, but that might be me being biased. there are many comical parts to the film and even the serious violent parts are past off quite easily and in a funny way.  the situations that they get themselves in are mostly very funny.  this film is a very enjoyable way to spend 2 hours so just sit back and enjoy it.
B002IVLH60|4.0|For the majority of this decade, Pearl Jam have been known more for their live shows (which are amazing) and  their politics than they have for their new music.  The three studio albums they have relased (Binaural, Riot Act and Pearl Jam) were mixed bags to say the least.  Following an impressive string of albums that were both commercial and artistic successes in the 90's, Eddie Vedder started to get off track starting with 2000's Binaural.  Not that it was a bad album, it just seemed that the band were a bit unsure of themselves.  They were still attempting to hold onto their Gen X credibility and expand their artistic horizons while cranking out killer tunes.  The strain was obvious.  2003's Riot Act was largely forgettable and 2006's Pearl Jam tried to hard to recapture the riffs and angst of their early 90's work.  But on Backspacer, Pearl Jam are back in fine form.  If the album is not a masterpiece on par with Vs., Yield or Ten, it is certainly their most uncluttered and self assured (not to mention tightly focused) set of songs since their early days.  Clocking in at under 40 minutes, there is not a wasted moment on this set.  From the up tempo rockers \\"Got Some\\" and \\"The Fixer\\" to the arena-ready anthem \\"Amongst the Waves\\", to the stripped down ballads \\"Just Breathe\\" and \\"The End\\", Pearl Jam throw in a little bit of all of the elements of their past albums and come up with a thoroughly satisfying rock record.  The band's playing is sharp and focused and Vedder's vocals are as rich with expression and passion as ever before. Backspacer may not be the huge, career reviving comeback that some fans and critics are hoping for, but it is the band's best album in almost 10 years.  For now, that's more than enough from a group that seemed to have lost their way and forgotten the sheer exhiliration that rock can provide.  Here's hoping they don't forget again.
B000LXH0AE|3.0|Nor did anything in this film stir me to a laugh or a shaft of light, much less to a state of tension over its outcome.While the script was not focused on a new idea, films need not have new ideas to be entertaining, what they need is entertainment. Despite the talent of the performers, there was little they could do with the sodden script. Frankly, it would be unseemly further to beat this unpretentious effort. If you are stuck with watching it, there is nothing painful in doing so.
B000FSME1A|5.0|Apocalypse Now is loosely based on the book `Hear of Darkness by Joseph Conrad; the film was directed by Francis Ford Coppola and set in the Vietnam War; Martin Sheen plays Captain Benjamin L. Willard who is picked from a `Special forces' group to hunt down and assassinate Colonel Walter Kurtz, who has supposed to have gone insane. Kurtz is played only shortly by Marlon Brando but he gives off the impression that the madness of war he has witnessed in this \\"new war\\" Vietnam, has pushed him over the edge. Dennis Hopper plays a brilliant bit part as the photojournalist; he reviles Kurtz like a poetic God, the parts played by the crew of the small boat are played well by Frederic Forrest as the `Chef', Laurence Fishburne as `Mr. Clean' (A young colored boy who thinks the war is one big adventure). There are other parts played by Robert Duvall who plays Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore, who tries to act like one of the boys and likes to surf. Harrison Ford plays a bit part early on in the film as an up and coming gopher for the generals.     Along with Coppola, John Milius has written a brilliant a subtle screenplay about the horror of war, the whole film works well although it is renowned for the multitude of problems while filming. The film was filmed in the Philippines and on numerous occasions the President of the country had to take the helicopters that he had rented to Coppola away to fight the real `Revolution' on the opposite side of the film. The film was also to run into numerous financial difficulties that literally bankrupted the Coppola family, but on its release in 1979, the film was rewarded with two Oscars, which in my eyes is a little disappointing.
B002I9Z8DK|5.0|Wrath of Kahn is the quintessential Star Trek movie. The Undiscovered Country comes close at being just as good.    As for this blu-ray version of the movie there is little I can say that is negative. My only gripe is that they changed the box art (although it makes sense for them as they are trying to re-image Star Trek). The video and audio transfer is near flawless. This disc is also loaded with special features. So far I have only watched the Farewell video to Bones as well as a few of the behind the scenes. It is really good to see that they tried really hard to make this blu-ray jam packed full of stuff for the fans rather than a rehash bare bones release. I have this movie on VHS, DVD and now blu-ray and each version has been worth every penny.    Get this movie and let your inner nerd take over!
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|Is he kidding me.  What an insult to my intelligence.  Pre ordered it and actually put down another book I was reading just to dive into the lost symbol.  The plot twists if you can call them that seen a mile away.  At one point Ifelt like I was watching a bad horror movie and wanted to yell dont go to the house alone what an idiot.  I always knew what was going to happen always figured out who the bad guy really was and oh yeah always knew what the special word was.  Duh.  I will nver read anotther Dan Yawn I mean Brown book..  You want to read  a brown book get deception point.
B002BFIN6K|3.0|Yes, it's true. This is a ripoff. I, too, was expecting an SACD. The back label says DSD, but this is only a standard CD. Very misleading. You've been warned.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I have owned this very special DVD for several years now,  I never ever want to leave the screen while it's playing, which leaves me without food, munchies, something to drink or a bathroom break. Okay, okay...  I use the \\"pause\\" button a few times.<br /><br />If the storyline doesn't glue you to your monitor, the Actors (yes, all of them) will capture you and keep you mesmorized throughout the many discs.  There were a few ocassions, when I was just meeting a new/added character and found the casting a bit odd, but soon realized that I had under-appraised the range of a few of the Actors.<br /><br />It makes a great Marathon, especially for people who love things Military.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|The System Has Failed was good.  United Abominations was great.  Endgame is brilliant.    I love that Dave Mustaine has truly returned to his thrash metal roots. This is his heaviest album since Rust in Peace (which isn't to say that the albums that came after RiP were bad, quite the opposite). The soloing and riffing on the album is phenomenal. Now we have to hope that Dave doesn't freak out and fire everyone that worked on this album. He has a GREAT lineup and he needs to stick with it.    Personal favorites on this album are: Dialectic Chaos/This Day We Fight!, Endgame and Headcrusher.
B000NQRR1Q|2.0|In my case, I bought The ninth gate because I saw it many times and I have the original Book, El Club Dumas, the story catch you and make you feel like Lucas Corso... mistery, suspense, history, romance, humor... BUT, I need the DVD with spanish subtitles to share the movie with my family and TREE TIMES I receive it without subtitles, it's too bad wait for a wrong product... tree times. But for the movie, I give five stars, excellent.
0525948023|3.0|This book is an introductory guide to spriritual inner peace ascribing to no specific religion.  As Tolle will tell you, the attainment of inner peace is most certainly not going to be found by simply reading the book, or any other book for that matter.  He repeats his main themes frequently- people's thoughts are flooded with meaninglessless, our motivation for action is often rooted in ego, we don't love each other unconditionally, we don't enjoy the moment...  While much of what he says is true and would do the world an immense positivite change if practiced more, his explanation of the pursuit of living things is limited reconciling enlightened consciousness with physical form, time, and the nature of thought.  Those topics are ancient philosophical mysteries and he attempts them too lightly.  No NYTimes bestseller will give you the meaning of life, but for those that are ready to take some initial steps toward a more peaceful and humble existence, this is a good read.
B00009MGGI|5.0|Terrific acting with a great, great script.  If you liked the way \\"The West Wing\\" looked at how government works from the inside, you may love this very different, very British story of the machinations of power.
B00004XPPC|5.0|Yes, I was one of those rare individuals who actually found the overly praised `Lawrence of Arabia' to be a hollow movie experience and I was duly crucified for my opinion.  I don't really expect much a crucifixion to befall me on my review for this beloved film directed by, you guessed it, David Lean.  Why?  Because I actually really, really liked this movie and consider it to be nearly everything that `Laurence of Arabia' wasn't.<br /><br />Lean's `The Bridge on the River Kwai' is a powerfully moving and engrossing example of sharp direction, developed scripting and affecting performances.<br /><br />The film tells of a group of British soldiers residing in a POW camp in Southeast Asia who, under the command of British Colonel Nicholson, attempt to build a railway bridge over the river Kwai.  The orders come from the harsh yet remarkably human Colonel Saito, and Nicholson, filled to the brim with a sense of balanced pride, takes it upon himself to make the bridge his own personal project; something with which he can take comfort in and hopefully give his wary men purpose.<br /><br />While our focus is mainly given to that of Nicholson and his men, the sub-plot involving escapee Shears and his return to the camp (on a special mission to destroy the bridge) is probably the most exciting.<br /><br />Using full range of the films story, Lean constructed a very well rounded film that is equal parts exciting and profound; leaving us so much to absorb and be absorbed in.  His attention to detail is sublime (a very, very deserved Oscar win on Lean's part), and that attention bleeds through onto every scene.  I also really loved his pacing here, for he understood how to give us subtle yet powerful without overexerting himself in the least.  By contrasting the two stories he was able to create and even and complete film that had room for the soft and thought provoking as well as the exciting and thrilling.<br /><br />The acting is also superb, from supporting players like Sessue Hayakawa (a very deserving Oscar nominee) to the two leads, William Holden and Alec Guinness.  I am not surprised to see Guinness won the Oscar for his riveting and fully realized portrayal of a honorable man seeking fervently to hold onto that said honor, but I personally preferred Holden's multi-layered portrayal of a man trying to forget who he was yet being forced to face it front on.  I'm sure it was the final scene (that marvelous breakdown) that won Guinness the Oscar (and the fact that Holden already had one) but it was Holden that really stayed with me long after the film was over.<br /><br />No, `The Bridge on the River Kwai' is not the best movie I've ever seen.  In fact, when it comes to the year that was 1957 (a STUNNING year for film) it wouldn't even make my personal ballot (maybe if I were to limit myself to English language films only, but even then I prefer the likes of `Peyton Place' and `An Affair to Remember' to be completely honest) BUT, and this is a big but; `The Bridge on the River Kwai' is a marvelous movie experience and one that is truly deserving of the praise it has received.  There are a lot of films that garner respect and admiration and become `classics', and sadly a lot of them are not as deserving as you would expect.<br /><br />`The Bridge on the River Kwai' IS deserving.scar nominee) to the two leads, William Holden and Alec Guinness.

B000001FQQ|4.0|I cannot consider myself as a KISS fan, but I grow up drawing their make ups in my notebooks when I was five. Hot in the shade isn't my favorite recording of KISS, I like better Revenge, Unmasked, Destroyer, Unplugged... but Hot in the shade contains two or tree songs very good, the another ones not famous but very clear production, nice melodies and good lyrics.
B0025VLELQ|4.0|Even when I saw this as a kid I didn't think the special effects were very good, but that didn't stop me from enjoying it.  This is a good, fun story.  Its clever if not unique way of bringing a human into space to live out his dreams and save all of man-kind from disaster is usual 80s corny fun, but you will be smiling.  The cast is good, the story fun, just those darn special effects are an eye sore.  Still this was one of the first to use computer animation and for that alone it is worth seeing just to see how much things have progressed.
1580088694|5.0|What a cool book! I had to have it for an Economic Geography class and it is just the coolest. It shows families around the world with a weeks worth of their food, and they talk about their lives, eating habits, what they used to eat and how that's changed.  It also has recipes for each family, a REAL eye opener.  All my roomates were jealous...
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|I bought it for my daughter and she just loves it!! She sees it over and over again.
B002AT4K9Q|5.0|This is a great movie! Just added it to my list of favorite movies! OK, history lesson, F&F1 stared Vin Diesel in another of my favorite movies. Then things went odd with F&F2; different story line different people; not one of my favorites. F&F3 Tokyo Drift is one of my favorites but yet again different story line and characters. OK, this F&F (F&F4) goes back to the original characters with the original people and extends the original story. Note, in the blu-ray version in the extras menu, there is a 20 minute short \\"movie\\" that fills in the gap between F&F1 and the start of F&F4.<br /><br />Insanely great action. State of the art photography with alot of live action; some green screen and very little CG. And the various races and car chases are edge-of-your-seat intense!<br /><br />If you liked any of F&F1 to 3, you will love 4! This is a must see and I will see it again and again. Its already loaded into my little portable movie player via Digital Copy.<br /><br />So, what's your opinion, Import Car or American Muscle Car?
B00000G3AZ|4.0|Gwyneth Paltrow got my attention right away as Emma, even though the story did not, but it wasn't long before I was interested.  Emma seems to be outside the story at first watching and altering other people's lives and so the audience is a little detached as well, but when a handsome suitor starts to give her attention and she begins to have feelings of her own for someone else that is where the real story shines.<br /><br />The acting is all excellent, the sets as well.  This is top notch entertainment for period piece lovers.  I have never read the book so I can not compare the two, but I recommend this based on its own work and not on Jane's.
1906355630|5.0|\\"I'm a lawyer, not a bird!\\" may be your gut-level reaction to anyone suggesting that legal professions ought to use the social media platform Twitter as part of their professional practice. That was certainly my thought before I read the newly-released \\"Social Media for Lawyers: Twitter Edition\\" book by New York lawyer Adrian Dayton. I've been convinced otherwise.    \\"Social Media for Lawyers: Twitter Edition\\" is both an enjoyable read and a useful step-by-step guide to using Twitter. Most importantly, whether you are a novice at social media or simply uninitiated in the Twitter environment, Dayton's book will give you the confidence to boldly join the worldwide Twitter community with a professional image.    The book dispels the myths that stop people from using Twitter, then explains the simplicity and power of this online tool. Learn everything from creating a profile with a hook, @replies, retweets, hash tags, tweet-ups, and TweetDeck without feeling like a \\"dummy\\" or \\"idiot.\\" Then learn how to use the power of Twitter to generate leads and grow your business.     \\"Social Media for Lawyers: Twitter Edition\\" is a must have for anyone wanting to use Twitter, even if they aren't a lawyer.
0061537969|5.0|Loved the story. I love books that have something different to them and this was definitely unique... in a very good way! I'm not into racing but the story still appealed to me. Anyone can relate to this book whether they're a dog lover or not. By the end of the book you'll be ready to adopt an Enzo of your very own! The ending was bittersweet. Sad but still uplifting. I've recommended it to 4 friends and all of them really enjoyed it too.
1400049628|5.0|This book is freakin awsome. I am a huge zombie fan let it be books or movies I love it all and Max Brooks is a fantastic author.
B000XA5K48|5.0|This movie is intended to be an over-the-top, tongue-in-cheek, roll-your-eyes, comic book.  It doesn't have a message, it doesn't have a plot, it doesn't have a single pretension.  It is an amusement park ride, with no more reason for existing than a roller coaster.  And what a roller coaster!  If you insist on complete realism in your movies, this one isn't for you.  If you like excitement and can suspend your sense of disbelief for a couple of hours, buy this movie.  You'll want to watch it again.
B000021XS0|4.0|This album is an artistic masterpiece. Lyrically interesting, and well put together. Musically, it is engaing from beginning to end. And in general, the quality is consistent throughout, quite a feat for a 77 minute rock drama.    It's only weakness is that in a couple of sections, LaBrie's singing really lacks any musical melody, \\"catch\\", or creativity. It just kind of plugs along, as if LaBrie couldn't come up with any creative ways to get the lyrics out, and just forces them into the song. This is minimal, but noticible in a few sections (like the second half of track 6, which is too bad because the first half of track 6 is one of the best parts of the whole album).    Otherwise, there is nothing else negative to say about the whole work. Nothing stands out as a \\"single\\", and nothing fades to the back as \\"filler\\". If you're looking for highlights, the two instrumental sections are amazing (Overture 1928 & Dance of Eternity). Also outstanding are the driving \\"Deja Vu\\" and the mellow \\"Through Her Eyes\\". But again, this album is consistent from beginning to end.    Finally, I enjoyed the hints of musical connections to \\"Metropolis, Part 1\\" (from Images & Words) here and there. Nonetheless, this piece stands up musically as new, fresh, and engaging on its own merits.    4 1/2 stars overall.
B0025KVLVA|3.0|This double CD is an awesome collection, which will delight any Beatle fan - but it also dissapoints.  Most of my issues are with Disc 1. Here are a few reasons why:  \\"Thank You Girl\\" and \\"She Loves Me\\" appear in MONO.  We were supposed to get all the stereo versions this time around with the remasters.  So I checked out The Beatles Capitol Versions Vol. 1 (containing the BEATLES SECOND ALBUM) and both songs are presented in excellent stereo and what a difference that makes, especially on \\"Thank You Girl\\".  The classic Beatle's hit \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\\" sounds so thin and weak on this remastered version - there is no \\"Beatlemania\\" excitement going on here.  Once again I refer you to the Capitol Version Vol 1 (containing MEET THE BEATLES) where \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\\" has such rock n' roll power that it makes you want to stand up and dance.  The new remastered version will put you to sleep.  Sorry.  Likewise with the B-side song \\"This Boy\\".  The new remastered version is also weak and puts all the vocals on the right channel (which is probably how it was originally recorded) but the Capitol Version has the vocals mixed in the middle and I think it makes all the difference in the world creating a much stronger song. So, I am a bit perplexed since I expected more from this newly remastered version.      That said, I must say Disc 2 is great all around and is an improvement over the original issue from the late 80's (of course, there's no Capitol Versions of these songs available to compare).  And I absolutely love the remastered sound of \\"The Inner Light\\" and \\"We Can Work It Out\\", two of my favorites.  It's great to have the single-versions of \\"Get Back\\" and \\"Let It Be\\" which are superior to the versions contained on the LET IT BE album.  And, of course, \\"Hey Jude\\" will NOT dissapoint - it sounds fantastic.
B000NA28IE|4.0|This is one of those instances where the book is better than the movie (Isn't that how it usually is?) In fact, the movie was a little bit disappointing. It barely followed the book, and the parts that did were almost destroyed. Also, time is a problem in the movie. No not the fact that it only lasted about an hour and 45 minutes, although I didn't like that either. It was how the movie ran. The book takes place over a period of weeks. The movie made it look like Eragon lived right next door to the Varden instead of traveling miles and miles every day. All in all, dissappointed. Only buy this if you are a real, die-hard Inheritance fan. Otherwise, just rent it and save your money.
0385504225|2.0|As Dennis Leary said about \\"Titanic\\": \\"Yeah, yeah, ok, it's a boat.\\" This is not a good book. It it uninspired and poorly written. The man has no rhythm in his writing. Da Vinci was a good page turner. I've read the others too and liked Angels & Demons. But this? It's like Crichton's last novels. He just keeps repeating a formula. Most of this book is a lecture on symbology and an ad for the many virtues of the Freemasons. He constantly loses the plot and goes back in time or lets his characters discuss \\"ancient mysteries\\" in the most unrealistic situations. At times this is downright silly. I don't think Mr. Brown wanted to be funny and/or cheap but he managed both. And the finale is ridiculous. Sad.
B000002JPA|5.0|This album is DT's best.  \\"Pull Me Under\\" is a great opening number, and perhaps the best constructed song in their whole catalog.  \\"Surrounded\\" is my favorite on this album, with its optimistic yet edgy flavor, with a mellow opening and closing. Other standouts are \\"Metropolis, Pt. 1\\" & \\"Learning to Live\\".  Also, LaBrie really sings this album well, probably his best DT performance, as he shows off his range without taking away from the songs. The real quality of his voice, though, can be heard and felt on the mellow \\"Wait for Sleep\\".  The only song I can't really get into is \\"Take the Time\\" ... not a bad song, just didn't click with me.
0385504225|2.0|Not as interesting nor as finely honed as his prior works.  But worst of all  --- the \\"big twist\\" was far too obvious.  I am placing Dan Brown among the list of authors leveraging their past excellence with a less than average follow up work.  Dan Brown meet Patricia Cornwell.    A waste of time and money
0143116371|5.0|I've followed Scott Schuman's blog for the past couple of years, so I'm familiar with most of the images in the book. Even so, it's fun to have them in  print. Whenever I need to put a smile on my face, I turn to pages of The sartoriatist!
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Dan Brown's writing is inspirational. In Lost Symbol, he inspires the reader to look back in time and study/review the ancient mysteries of our world. To the author, thank you! Please continue to write your Word.
1883217040|5.0|I still haven't finished the whole book, but up to now I find it so interesting and easy to read and study.     Because it is not only about theory, it is also about who and how is using this theory, in which context, in which song etc.    A great book if you want to have a great jazz theory guide.
B002C6K7N0|4.0|Many of the songs in this album lack a memorable riff that makes me want to grab my guitar and just jam to it. That being said, it is still a solid album as one would expect nothing less from Dave. 44 Minutes, Hardest Part, Headcrusher, Endgame all had memorable melodies and riffs either throughout or at some points in their song. A lack of bridge-moments and harmonized solos were \\"lacking\\" which are usually signature moments for many Megadeth songs, however the Headcrusher bridge was awesome (2:00) and reminded me of a moment in Peace Sells and Wake Up Dead. Hardest Part had a brief cool moment (1:52) that reminded me of some goth-metal like Nightwish-ish/Within Temptation.<br /><br />I liked the album but it would not be in my top 5 of their albums.<br /><br />I have been a huge Megadeth fan since 1988. And yea, I even appreciated many of the songs in Risk, which was the most un-Megadeth-like album Dave has put out with the band.
1416550542|3.0|In this plot-driven narrative, Morton takes the reader through a four-generation history of a family and its quirks - if one can call obsession a quirk.  The premise is that Nell was abandoned as a four-year-old on a ship bound for Australia.  She, and later her granddaughter, end up searching for Nell's identity in England.    The characters remain rather sketchy throughout this novel; Nell is the only character whose personality traits are thoroughly examined, and she's not pleasant.  The author tells her tale via chapters with difffering narrators, an effective technique since she does indicate by name and date which character is narrating.  The chronology is rather jarring at times in its twisting through Nell's adoptive and biological families.      The last twist in Nell's family history was a surprise to me.  By that time, however, I didn't particularly care what had happened.    I did truly love the fairy tales included in this book.

0439023491|5.0|'Catching Fire' is the excellent sequel to Suzanne Collins' 'The Hunger Games.'  Some sequels can be enjoyed without reading the first book but I don't recommend it for this trilogy.  So much happens in book one that seriously impacts the action of 'Catching Fire' and Suzanne Collins does not waste any time in getting to the meat of the story.<br /><br />In 'The Hunger Games' Katniss Everdeen angers the Capitol with the clever and inflammatory way that she saves her life as well as that of fellow District 12 tribute Peeta.  Now that they have both returned to District 12 Katniss and Peeta try to take back the threads of their life prior to the Games.  All that changes after a visit from President Snow where he demands that since Katniss' actions have led to rebellion in some of the districts that her charade of love with Peeta was apparently not convincing enough.  Furthermore, if Katniss doesn't convince everyone on the upcoming tour that she is truly in love with Peeta President Snow will take it out on her family.<br /><br />Determined to save everyone, Katniss sets out to prove to the world that she and Peeta are the real deal but it never seems to be good enough.  The Capitol (aka President Snow) truly has it out to destroy Katniss Everdeen and all that she stands for ... except she's not just standing up for herself and Peeta anymore but for her family, her district and the cause.<br /><br />'The Hunger Games' and 'Catching Fire' are excellent books that are at once easy to read and difficult to think through.  The language is simple enough but some of the concepts of survival, friendship and self-sacrifice really make you question humanity, politics and the deceptively simple concept of right and wrong.  The characters too are easy enough to imagine.  If you don't imagine yourself as Katniss, clever and brave, you may see yourself in Peeta's artistic and sacrificing nature or Cinna's subtlety in undermining the Capitol. Collins' writes the characters in a way that makes you know and love them and worry for them all through the books.<br /><br />Both books are excellent reads and highly recommended. A note of warning: you may want to set aside enough time to get through the books fairly quickly or you'll spend all your time away from the book worrying about the characters. Enjoy!that makes you know and love them and worry for them all through the books.<br /><br />Both books are excellent reads and highly recommended.

0385504225|5.0|I truly enjoyed reading this book. I read for pleasure, not to over criticize sentences or paragraphs. I read with the hope that the book will flow smoothly and keep my attention. This book did that exceptionally well. I have enjoyed all of Dan Brown's books and hope he keeps them coming.
1563899426|4.0|I've heard good things about this series and have almost picked it up many times over the past year or so.  I finally broke down and grabbed a copy a couple of weeks ago and I'm really glad I did.    I've enjoyed a lot of the \\"fairy tale retelling\\" stories that have been coming around lately, some more than others.  What I found even more fun about this premise is that the fairy tale characters have been dislocated from their fairy tale worlds and are now living in our world...trying to 'fit in' but also striving to maintain their own identities.    The character development and presentation was excellent.  I loved the adult depth given to these characters that are otherwise fairly 2-dimensional.  Seeing Jack (of Beanstalk fame) as a conniving, lying, scheming, unsuccessful con-man of sorts was great.  Snow White as the semi-snobbish clean cut acting-leader felt a little flat at first, but as the story went on and we saw more into her personality, she became even more intriguing.  Prince Charming was great as the over-confident schmoozer.  But my favorite had to be the portrayal of \\"Bigby\\" (as in \\"Big Bad\\" Wolf) as a sort of noir detective for the fairy tale folks.  Having just recently read Red Harvest, I had a feel for the hard-boiled detective and really liked Bigby's portrayal.    The art in this novel was well done and a lot of fun.  The central art was clean and nice and helped the story along....while at the same time, the artist had a lot of fun along the periphery by adding in small details that added humor or tension to the scenes and may not even be picked up on (I'm sure I missed a lot of the subtleties).    The story was engaging and very interesting.  At the heart of this particular book (the first in the series), there was some focus on introducing us to the characters.  By doing it through the course of a murder mystery, it allowed the author to provide backstory without it sounding like contrived monologues.  The mystery itself was a lot of fun andvery engaging.  I wish I could say I had it figured out before the very end...but I can't.  I did suspect something along the lines of what happened, but not exactly as it played out, which (in my opinion) is the way a good mystery novel should be framed (the reader shouldn't be able to figure things out too easily, but should feel like they came just inches behind the detective).    I was a little turned off by the amount of swearing in the book (I would love to have been able to share this with my kids, but the language will definitely make me keep it out of their hands for at least the next few years).  There were a couple of scenes of violence which were a little over the top (especially for young readers), but weren't overly graphic or offensive.  And the one \\"sex scene\\" and the couple of suggestive panels we in the PG to PG-13 range.  Overall, a movie version of the book would probably receive a PG-13 rating, possibly pushed to R if they decided to overplay the language/violence or expound on the sex.  If the language was toned down a bit, it could probably be a solid PG.    Overall, this was a great read and a very fun world filled with wonderful characters.  I'm definitely planning to follow this series (from the B&N shelf, it looks like there are 10+ books already).  I may have to increase my book allowance so I can catch up more quickly.      ****  4 stars
0061537969|4.0|This was a really good book.  I'm not a race car person , but it wasn't as bad since it was coming from a dog.  We have a lab and I could relate to the times the dog wanted to communicate to people when he turned his head sideways and raised his ears.
0385341008|5.0|The title put me off as something silly or fluffy.  Had my book club not selected it, I probably would not have read the book and missed a wonderful experience. The characters are heart-warming and unforgettable.  I think it is destined to be a  well-loved classic.
1591791707|5.0|When I am in a conflict, there are really just two things I need to do - listen to the person I am talking to, and make requests from him or her. Marshall's NVC provides a framework for both. You may ask \\"why would I need to have a framework for such simple actions?\\" The answer is simple - in the heat of a conflict I can easily fall into the trap of blaming or accusation or name-calling, none of which lead to resolution. If I use the NVC framework, I can keep a level head and focus on the solution. These CDs have really improved my interactions in my personal life and at work. The only downside is Marshall's soothing voice, which is too easy to tune out after 5 hours of listening. But if you can listen, the content is excellent.

0671027344|4.0|This book has faced challenges in many schools and communities. Check out the interview with Stephen Chbosky from Word Riot on his response to some of the challenges.    My response: What's more important - a few things you don't agree with, or a powerful story about a teenage boy learning to deal the world around him? I know, what a silly question.    I'll be honest, I had a hard time with this book at first. I spent the first part of the book wondering whether Charlie was supposed to have emotional problems or whether the writing was just awkward. When it became clear that Charlie did have emotional problems, I started to wonder why nobody but me seemed to notice. But then comes the big reveal... And Chbosky does it so well that it made the whole rest of the book shift into focus, and I could see why this is such a powerful book for so many teenagers.
0385504225|4.0|The Lost Symbol has engaged me for 3 days and after these 3 days it's gone forever, mainly because the hidden knowlegde is superficial and does not penetrate the very core of the wisdom of the ages. The reviews have kept me busy for 3 hours to learn about American society in 2009. About 99% of the reviews are absolutely boring and tell not much of interest about the book, but a lot of the reviewers. Students sociology and psychology can easily write a good essay of the great divides in contemporary America using the stars given as an entrance for their essay.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|While Dan Brown's works usually require you to actively suspend your disbelief, his past works have done so in a way that do not strain the reader too much. Unfortunately, I cannot say that about this book.<br /><br />The symbology that Brown uses in this story is top-notch. He depicts features of the U.S. Capitol building that very few probably ever think about. Professor Langdon's teaching scenes are entertaining (and I'd probably enjoy a class like Langdon's). Brown uses this mythology well and crafts an intriguing page turner (at times).<br /><br />The villain is a bit of a disappointment. The motivations are never clear until near the climax of the story, and the villain's role seems weaker without the shadowy \\"controller\\" that worked behind the scenes in The DaVinci Code.<br /><br />The entire \\"noetic science\\" meme is a weak plot device. Brown risks turning the story into a spoof of his own works. Brown could have used the meme of greed in capitalism to achieve the same plot movement without the strain on credulity. The same goes for the \\"resurrection\\" of one of the characters (no spoilers from me).<br /><br />I'm glad I ordered the Kindle version of this book. For ten bucks, I feel like I got my money's worth. Had I paid for the print version (discounted or full price), I would have felt like I did not get my money's worth.
B001JDSGPI|5.0|Loads of details and intricate plots made this book a really interesting read.  It is definitely a long one, but worth it for the amount of detail included.  I don't know of any pieces of the Arthurian Legends that were left out.  Character development was fantastic, I felt like I knew everyone inside and out, particularly Morgaine and Gwenhyfar.  Can't wait to get started reading the prequel, The Forest House.
0385504225|3.0|Forgive me, but I am going to break from my normal format of first offering a short Synopsis of the book, followed by My 2 Cents Worth.    I feel like I just read the same 500 page book for the third time. Just see the summaries of The DaVinci Code or Angels & Demons - the story lines are nearly identical, but in The Lost Code we are in Washington DC discovering the long lost secrets of the Masons instead of the Knights Templar in England, or the Catholic Church in Rome.    \\"A diabolical madman is threatening to destroy the world's religious orders by exposing the \\"truth\\" through a series of secret codes, paintings, rituals, and ancient symbols. At stake is the most significant treasure the world has ever known. If the treasure falls into the hands of the evil one, chaos will ensue, all of the world's religions will be exposed as fraudulent and cease to exist. It is up to Robert Langdon to solve the cryptic riddles and thwart the evil one and stop the human sacrifices.\\" This could preface any of the three books.    Seriously, I respect an author's right to sell his work and become wealthy doing so, but this is a study in redundancy. His formula for selling a blockbuster is much too shallow and transparent, much like the National Treasure movies. The first one was cutting edge and captured the imagination, but the later installments were written and produced for no other reason than to cash-in on the success of the original. We were sold the same story with a different cover.    I can't help but feel like The Lost Symbol was commissioned by Hollywood to support the sequel to The DaVinci Code and Angels & Demons. A screenplay masquerading as a novel.    The most important thing to remember is that all three of these books are works of FICTION. Despite the ingenious marketing campaign that promoted the controversy of Brown's ability to blur the line between Biblical scripture and and conspiracy theory, the entire premise is purely fictional.    I did enjoy the book, asI love the cryptic puzzles; it was a compelling story. However, if you expect The Lost Symbol to be anything other than a repackaging of the first two books, you will surely be disappointed. Save your money.    hardback  528 pages  6 1/4 hours
B002KLAL4W|3.0|Before I risk offending any PJ fans, let me just state that I have been an avid supporter of their music through the years and own every Pearl Jam studio album and a number of live albums and DVDs, as well as most of the band members' solo and side projects, and most of the available works from the bands that later formed Pearl Jam.    That being said, Pearl Jam has always been a band that can experiment with different types of sound all while sounding uniquely like themselves.  Everything from \\"Ten\\" to \\"Riot Act\\" was golden.  Then came the long-delayed self-titled album.    Still, any band that can release seven good studio albums in a row deserves to be forgiven for one bad album.  By this reasoning, I bought \\"Backspacer\\" on the day of its release.    From the time the first track was half-over, I found myself crossing my fingers in hopes that the failures of the self-titled album had not been repeated.  For the most part, unfortunately, the same weaknesses of its predecessor show up in \\"Backspacer\\".  But that does seem ironically fitting given the name of the album.    The few ways in which PJ experimented on this album made me wish they hadn't even bothered to experiment at all.  I'm sorry, Eddie & Co., but you can't pull off New Wave.  Still, this album DID have a few highlights worth checking out, but even they fall tragically short of any material off the first seven albums.    Track by track:  Gonna See My Friend- 4/10  Got Some- 6/10  The Fixer- 6/10  Johnny Guitar- 6/10  Just Breathe- 7/10  Amongst the Waves- 7/10  Unthought Known- 4/10  Supersonic- 2/10  Speed of Sound- 7/10  Force of Nature- 7/10  The End- 6/10    Overarching theme/mood- 2/5  Album progression- 3/5

B002BSHWUU|3.0|After listening to all of the songs on the stereo set, I have to say there is an improvement over the 1987 CDs (especially Beatles For Sale), but I believe the remastering could have been far better. I have bootlegs of needle drop transfers from the 1978 vinyl stereo box set and those sound amazing. The clarity of the guitar in the opening of \\"If I Fell\\" easily beats the 2009 remasters. I noticed several instances of the high end sounding dull and the low end hardly audible, especially in the early albums. Several songs on Please Please Me sound a little flat just as they did on the 1987 mono CD. The engineers who did the remastering wanted to be faithful to the original recordings so much that we are stuck with the fake stereo mix during the second half of \\"I Am The Walrus\\" when a proper stereo mix was made available on 1999's Yellow Submarine Songtrack.    Many reviewers have complained of the \\"ping-pong\\" stereo effect, most noticebale on With The Beatles. I tend to agree that a modern remix should be done for the entire catalogue. There is too much seperation in many songs that the center seems dead. The Songtrack contains a modern stereo mix of \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" where the remastered CDs have that awful ping-pong seperation. This box set could have really brought the Beatles music into the 21'st century, but unfortunely we are given old fashioned mixes which sound really, really dated. Are purists that powerful in that they just HAD to have those old mixes?  Take your remastered CDs, burn them to your computer and equalize and mix the channels to your liking. I used a simple program like Goldwave and have brought up the bass for a warmer sound and increased the treble for more clarity. Goldwave also has noise reduction for annoying tape hiss, most noticeable on the opening note of \\"Yes It Is\\" and the quiet sections of \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\". I had to remaster the remasters.    **Update: I also noticed two typos on the back covers. On the back of the white album the colon after \\"Me and My Monkey\\" is misplaced. Also, on the back of Let It Be the \\"r\\" in Peter Brown is missing in the 'Thanks to' section. Apple can't even get THAT right.
0439023491|5.0|I used to write reviews quite frequently but have been writing less recently as nothing has captured my interest as greatly as this series. With a perfect blend of excellent writing, memorable characters you find yourself alternately cheering for and questioning, and excellent storylines that run in multiple directions and converge nicely, Suzanne Collins has certainly made a huge impression on me. While I can't claim any one story idea that she has created is entirely original (Stephen King's \\"The Running Man\\" , George Orwells \\"1984\\"  both come to mind), it is with the sheer abandon that she approaches writing that draws me to these books. Overall I would recommend this series to pretty much anybody who likes a good read that is both full of action and adventure but keeps it eye on the goal of creating writing that is substantial in the real life issues it approaches. I highly recommend these books to everyone.
0385504225|4.0|I found this book ultimately more satisfying than the \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" which I had also enjoyed.  Yes, Brown has a formula, and his characters' dialogue can make you wince (especially so near the end of this book -- the exchanges between the two main characters are almost painful to read, as Brown tries to convey his own quasi-mystical views through Robert and Katherine), but still, the book was a fun, fascinating read.  Moreover, the underlying motive of the book strikes me as far more positive than that of \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\"  Rather than tear down, this time Brown is trying to build up, to affirm a positive message.  The message itself may be a bit vague and fuzzy, but it is positive and hopeful.
B001ILFUDC|3.0|This is a great old favorite, but after being forced to watch a series of advertisements before ever getting to the movie, it took some of the enjoyment away from finally watching the film.  The fact that you can't even fast forward through the promos each time the DVD is watched is beyond frustrating.  The 3-star rating applies to the DVD in its entirety and not the film alone (which by itself rates higher). I should have listened to other reviewers who also complained about this same issue. Too much hassle to return, so I'm keeping it. Live and learn I guess.
0446560065|5.0|I bought the book after watching two videos on [...] of Simon's Cat ([...]). It was a very good decision.  I sat down to read some of it the day the book arrived before leaving for an appointment.  I could not just read some.  I could not help but laugh out loud.  If you are a cat owner you can relate.

B001DJLCRC|5.0|This is different than your regular TV show.  You are hanging on the edge or your seat wondering how Walt and Jesse will get out their predicaments. One of the interesting things is that this is not far fetched.  This could happen to your local Highschool Chemistry Teacher.  You never know what will happen next. This, and Season Two, is worth purchasing.  Bryan Cranston (Walt) just won an emmy.  I'm stoked for Season Three. Breaking Bad is way above any drama on TV.
B000JIJPZY|1.0|I can't imagine any baby being interested in this.  There is really not much to it, the velcro pieces pull off easily, the music player hangs down in the baby's face so if they roll over they hit their head on it, and the mirror/ball/flap on the end is pointless.  The flap was almost permanently folded down, the ball barely spins, and the mirror is tiny.  My son never cared anything for this playmat; when he got a little older he used it to stand up.  All in all, this thing is a complete waste of money.  If this playmat actually entertains a baby, it won't last very long.
B002KECK1G|4.0|I watched this movie as an alternative to reading the book that is required by almost every College Institution in America and should be by every High School in America.  I read ALOT of reviews before I bought it and many said that the film was good but skipped over some of the book so I also got the Cliff Notes to fill in the blanks.  For my need, I found that the depth of the questions was such that the movie could answer most of it.  Although, I can imagine that if you have one of those higher intellect professors who wants intimate details then you will need the notes also.
075640407X|5.0|In short, I loved this book. I was hesitant to read it at first after hearing it described as a \\"Harry Potter for adults.\\" I'm not sure when Harry Potter became the standard for literary excellence, but if ever it was, The Name of the Wind is the new standard. Granted, I enjoyed Harry Potter and The Name of the Wind shares some commonalities with the series. The Name of the Wind involves magic and The Name of the Wind involves a school at which magic is taught. But the similarities end there.    The Name of the Wind offers such richness in character development and the dynamic interactions between those characters that you'll remember why you enjoy reading in the first place. Everything about the book is done right. The pacing is quick, but not rushed at the expense of depth. The characters are legendary, yet easy to relate to. There's a sense of mystery and intrigue that's actually presented in a coherent way, unlike other recent dramas whose mystery is contrived and there only to keep the audience present (and may or may not even point towards resolution). Rothfuss has clearly begun with the end in mind with The Name of the Wind. Your only disappointment will be that Rothfuss has not yet published the sequel.
0385504225|2.0|It was very predictable, and yes, the ending was very lame.     I really hated the last third part of the book (right after the isolation chamber)    And all the detailed explanaiton of everything............I better not comment on that.
B000V3OKW0|3.0|... as one can quickly discover by looking at the reviews of this bargain re-release as well as other, older editions. Wondering why, I dug out my old Archive LPs of Pierre Fournier to listen to him once again after being recently \\"blown away' by the performances of the same six suites by Jean-Guihen Queyras and Ophelie Gaillard. I was eager to hear what people had heard in Fournier's performance that set it apart from performances by other 20th C cellists.<br /><br />Okay... My Swedish grandmother had a massive oak dining table with claw feet, which could seat twelve full-sized Swedish uncles and great-uncles comfortably. I used to crawl under that table as a boy. It was the Platonic ideal for me of everything sturdy and imperturbable. Fournier's interpretation of Bach is like that: resonant, robust, grand, and muscular. His tone never sags. His tuning is as dependable as the return of wild geese in the spring. His bowing is reassuringly confident. His interpretation is thoughtfully grave throughout. But...<br /><br />... his tempi are unbearably slow, especially in the double bourees and courants. His phrasing is stiff, arbitrary, and bluffly unaware of the polyrhythmic layers of 'counting', with the effect that he seems to play all the notes but none of the note-groupings. It's like listening to dance music but having no idea of the steps. I have a nagging sense of 'not knowing where we are' in the unfolding of these sublimated dance structures, of hearing the notes but not the 'composition' of them.<br /><br />... his affect is solemn and resigned throughout, like the musical thoughts of a man focused on sorrow. Bach had other moods as a man, and I think he had other moods in mind for this music: humor, light-heartedness, graciousness, exuberance. I think old Bach would have considered Fournier a very dull companion.<br /><br />But that's just one listener's frankly subjective opinion, friends. You needn't heap scornful comments on me, or unhelpful votes, if you disagree. \\"Each bird finds its own nest beautiful,\\" as my Swedish grandmother would have said if she'd been Italian: A ogni uccello suo nido &eacute; bello.own nest beautiful,\\" as my Swedish grandmother would have said if she'd been Italian: A ogni uccello suo nido é bello.
0385504225|5.0|Yes, Dan Brown's grammar, syntax, and structure may leave his more literate readers dissatisfied, but this just tells me they were mistaken to be looking for great literature here.  [[ASIN:0385504225 The Lost Symbol]] proves once again that Dan Brown is a member in good standing of our pantheon of great story tellers; another genre entirely.<br /><br />I approached [[ASIN:0385504225 The Lost Symbol]] as a good read.  I wanted a great story, an adventure. Anything I might learn (or mislearn) along the way about freemasonry, pyramids, symbols, our founding fathers, or the architecture of Washington, DC: well, all the better. And I was not the least bit disappointed.<br /><br />So suspend your reality for a couple of evenings, and dive right in.  I guarantee you'll enjoy the twists and turns and improbable characters and their behaviors, and that you'll finish it feeling satisfied and happy about the world. And that is a perfectly good reason to read a book.
0061703087|4.0|What makes a book great IMO is when the story keeps you so completely hooked, you are unable to put it down until you've finally finished it in the wee hours of the morning. Prey met that criteria for me. Sure it wasn't perfect. The store became increasingly implausible and fantastic, some of the characters nothing but props, and I sure didn't like how they got \\"rid\\" of his wife so he could end up with the Luan (or whatever her name was) - hence 4, rather than 5 stars. Nevertheless, a fantastic read. I highly recommend it.
0375842209|1.0|I made it through about 50 pages.  I stopped in the middle of what seemed a never-ending whiny rant by the washerwoman about her clients.  A good author would have found a way to capture it all in a sentence or two.  I found the same wordiness in the prologue during which the author tried to establish the narrator's MO.  An author supposedly wrote a friend \\"I don't have time to write you a short letter, so I'm writing you a long letter.\\"  This author should have found the time to write us a short book.
0385504225|2.0|I was very frustrated reading this.  There were several situations that were too predictable and many that never would have happened if the participants were as smart as Dan Brown tried to make them out to be.  It seems Mr. Brown struggled to use his past accomplishments to sell a newer, lesser book.  It seems to have worked too.

B0017HEX76|4.0|I loved Fantasia when I was a kid, and it was now time to share it with my grandchildren.  I was satisfied with the price, quality and availability of this product, but, when my daughter first inserted the DVD into the player, she was disconcerted to find that the language of the speaker and the settings was Korean.  She's a clever woman and she managed to fiddle with the controls to find how to switch both the spoken and subtitled portions to English, but there was no indication in the ad on Amazon that this would be necessary, and no instructions accompanying the item as to how to adjust the settings for language.      Great show, but I think that the marketing was unclear at the least, and possibly misleading.  I am disappointed in the seller, whose response to my emailed comments was unsatisfactory to me.
0385504225|1.0|I'll think twice about buying anything published by Doubleday.  You'd think their editors and fact-checkers would have caught a lot of the stupidity.  Yes, it's a novel but many errors detract from the effect.  Brown is a total jerk for not even doing a Google search or two to get his facts straight.  Plasma screens do not shrink to a pinpoint when they turn off.  Liquid hydrogen is stored in a Dewar flask, not a cylinder.  The CIA is not permitted to do domestic operations, that's the FBI charter.  A senior CIA official who demands lethal force from a team on domestic soil against US citizens in a public building without a warrant?? Can't be that stupid.  A scientist smart enough to have her own secret lab isn't dumb enough fall for the transparent lies told to her.  Digital Fortress was full of gross errors, as were his other books.  You'd think he would have learned from that.  Apparently not.    At the list price, a huge waste.  At the Amazon price, still a waste of money.  Wait for it to show up in your local thrift store.  Two for a buck, maybe OK.
0671646788|3.0|The points the author makes are valid. But, my problem is he wastes a lot of time repeating his point, using multiple examples. And the examples aren't short, they tend to invovle stories.  I had to buy this book for a business class, it gives you a positive outlook on business and trying to think 'bigger' than everyone else.  If you have to buy it, it's alright. But, I personally did not find anything 'magical' about this book.

B002BFIN6K|5.0|As a software engineer at Zenph Studios, I am especially proud of the work our production team did on this album.    Rachmaninoff's compositions are well known, but this album brings to light his amazing artistry as a pianist.  Listen, for example, to this performance of his famous C-sharp minor prelude; he plays it with much more subtlety than most modern interpretations, using dynamic contrast to establish a captivating dialog between one voice tolling the opening three-note motif and other distinctly-softer voices answering it.    The other pieces on the album are also pianistic treats.  Rachmaninoff's transcriptions of \\"Flight of the Bumblebee\\" and \\"Scherzo from a Midsummer Night's Dream\\" showcase his dexterity, and are great fun to hear.  The intricacy of voicing and rubato in Rachmaninoff's performances of his original works is astounding, and each track is packed full of little musical surprises.    This album was re-performed on a 1909 Steinway model D on which Rachmaninoff may have very well played.  Thanks to recording engineer Richard King and everyone involved in the preparation of the piano, the sound of that wonderful instrument comes through beautifully in this album.  This disc presents each piece from two perspectives: an exceptional stereo version places you near the front of the audience while Rachmaninoff plays, and an intimate binaural stereo version seats you on the bench next to him.  The binaural version was recorded using a special dummy head with a microphone in each ear, carefully positioned so that when the tracks are played back through headphones, each note comes from its correct place in space (lower notes toward the left, higher notes toward the right).  This may be one of the best sounding piano albums ever made.    The first two posted reviews warn that this is not a SACD like our first two releases.  We would have loved to issue this in SACD surround, and Sony Masterworks recorded the masters necessary to do so (so, they exist), but Sony has since closed its SACD pressing facilities in the USA.
B000071K5L|4.0|To kill a Mockingbird was written beautifully by Harper Lee. Her work in this book is powerful and motivating. It is an American classic and it is loved by so many. It is a very relatable book, and it sends a strong message about discrimination and to be your own person. It teaches you to do what is right, and stand for what you believe in.     We see the world, in this book, through the eyes of a young girl. It gives a new understanding and perspective of what life was like for a child during this time. We can sense and feel the childlike qualities throughout the whole book. It gives the book a feeling of innocence, and an understanding of growing up.      This book begins in the mid 1930s in Maycomb, Alabama. Our narrator Scout lives with her father Atticus, and her brother Jem. Her father Atticus is a lawyer and he defends all sorts of people, including African Americans. This book shows the heartache that this family goes through because of what they believe in. this book is dramatic, humorous and exciting. It is definitely a page turner and you will not be able to put it down.

B000NQRE0K|3.0|The process which Braveheart got for the blu ray release was very successful, the overall image looks stunning BUT in unfortunately more than less shots i noticed some serious pixelization issues probably due to some kind of interlaced-structure that i have no idea where it could have come from. That leads to a line-doubleing effect and thereby divides the image resolution by 2. Once i spotted the defect it was absolutely distracting because the edges of sharp objects are not clean but destroyed by a zic-zac effekt. It could have been so much better if that issue was not appearing that often. Its hard to see where the problem came from but i am sure it could have been avoided, looks more like a transfer screw-up. Sound is actually very nice with very fine bitrates for TRUE HD. I doubt that later this year FOX will do better for Europe. They will probably just take the same encode ... still a nice Blu Ray, but it could have been way better if people would pay attention while checking their discs. Let's wait for Forrest Gump. 2 screw-ups out of 3 for the saphire collection .. i have my doubts for the third tilte.
B001NEK2GE|4.0|I use my G13 in a racing sim to adjust pit settings, etc and one problem is obvious.  There's no tactile clue for the vital G11 key.  I lost a couple places in one race when I was trying to get ready for a pit stop and got distracted trying to find the proper key so I could make adjustments.  Now, I've attached a small piece of foam to that key with double-sided tape so my fingers can find the key without hunting or mistakes.  Logitech could solve this with the usual indicators that are put on the F and J keys on regular keyboards.  Whether you're playing and FPS or a racing game, there's no time to be hunting around for the right keys.
B000YRY8BG|5.0|I'm so happy that I bought the BBC miniseries.  The Hollywood version was horrible!
0385504225|1.0|POSSIBLE SPOILERS    As many others I was quite disappointed. The book plot works on basic principle:    Robert L is not convinced that specific object points to real thing, explaining everything as metaphorical or symbolical. Then someone proves him wrong. He is amazed. Object indeed points to real location or clue. Then he is attacked or chased. Finding the next clue/location/object is not conviceted... [repeat/rinse].     After repeating this schema for about 10 times there is ending. And... apparently it points to something as metaphorical or symbolical as suggested at the very beginning.    The ending isn't up to standarts I would expect from Dan Brown.    While details about architecture, paintings or rites are quite interesting, there seems to be no direct connection between them. All point to or explain some aspects of Masonic Pyramid, but they are not interlinked as it was in previous Brown's books.    Neotic practices is another low point in this book. I would never call it \\"science\\". It is technobable about mystical human powers. Making it part of the book's plot was huge mistake.    Putting some crash test dumies instead of few characters would improve the storyline.   The most human characters were probably some extras like guard Nunez.    CIA's-uber-national-crisis doesn't sound so critical once you hear what is it.     Figuring out who is Mal'akh is so easy. (tips: how Andros knew about pyramid, why is he always called Inmate 37 when describing prison story).    Finally the editing gives me a headache. Some chapters are many pages long, some are \\"cutscenes\\". The amount of italics used is a strain for the eyes. Some chapters could be removed completely and no one would notice.    Overally all the interesting facts about Masons, ther part in designing/building Washington, paintings could be written as briliant article in National Geographic instead of this bloated brick of woodware.    Please refrain fom destoying tropical forest by buing this book.Regards    MJ
B002BGCCZC|5.0|This is one of their best albums.  There really isn't a weak song in the whole bunch.  Muse is one of the few artists that gets better and better the more you listen.  I get bored with music pretty quickly but not with their stuff.  I highly recommend this album!<br /><br />My personal favorite songs: Butterflies & Hurricanes (superbly crafted song, classical music mixed with epic rock music & vocals, Muse at their best), Time is Running Out (super cool soaring vocals and tempo changes), Falling Away With You (bittersweet love song, just gorgeous), Sing For Absolution (low sort of eerie tempo that builds to a great climax), Hysteria (amazing guitar & slamming beat), I could go on, seriously, I like them all!!
B002GZQY6Q|5.0|This album is pure genius.  If you've ever been a PT fan, or you want to become one, find out where they are playing near you on their current 2009 tour and get tix now!  I've been to hundreds of live rock shows and I have to say the 3 PT shows I've been to are the best sounding, most visually stimulating, amazing concerts I've ever witnessed!  Just wish I had gotten into these guys earlier so I could have seen more of their tours.  And I know, we all hate getting raped by Ticketmaster with all their little add-on fees, but PT shows are a once in a lifetime experience and well worth the cash!    Some PT fans may be a bit disappointed by this new release (at first), but trust me, it takes time to wrap your mind around it.  The thing I love about PT and Steven Wilson is the unfiltered creativity in everything they do.  Every album has a different feel and vibe to it.  Each time I get a new release of theirs it takes me some time to get into it.  I guess if you like cookie cutter bands and music that sounds like a hundred other bands, that may be annoying.  Trust me though, all the greatest albums out there are complex and usually an acquired taste...I could go on a severe tangent here, but lets get back to the new PT album...    I received The Incident (via pre-order) only days before seeing them live at Club Nokia in L.A.  I wasn't very familiar with the songs, but thought it was really cool that they opened by playing the entire Incident song (disk 1) in its entirety (CD 1 is really just one long 55+ min song).  The music just totally pulled me in from the start!  The crazy, trippy (creepy at times) videos they played during most of the songs reminded me of Tool, and were really cool by themselves (I wonder if they will release a video?).  Visual art at its finest IMHO.  Now when I listen to the album I remember all these flashes of the video playing during the show! They have this way of burning images into your brain.  Maybe its some form of hypnotic brain control.  Who knows, and I say who cares. I loved every minute of it!  I still can't listen to Fear of Blank Planet without remembering the videos they played during that live performance!  I can't recall ever being in such a trance at a show either--its like the show went on forever, but also went by too quickly at the same time.  Was totally sober too (well one warm $12 beer, but the venue was like 110 degrees inside so I probably sweat that one out before it even got to my blood).  BTW as venue's go, Club Nokia is pretty cool, great sound and it felt like some high-end club or something (I never thought they could transform the downtown L.A. area around there like that for the better).  My only complaint, aside from the ridiculous alcohol prices at shows these days, was the crazy heat inside!!!  Granted it was packed with PT fans, but damn.  Brought all new meaning to 'sweating my balls off'.  Next time PLEASE turn on the f**kin AC!    But I digress again...  Just goes to show how awesome PT was, after they started playing I forgot how incredibly HOT I was until the intermission following the Incident (exactly a 10 minute break complete with a digital countdown).  Entertainment that makes you forget about how extremely uncomfortable you are, gets bonus points in my book.    I can't say I really follow the whole story behind The Incident (yet), but I hope to figure it out with more listens...Its, yes, like all Steven Wilson's musical exploitations, complicated, but well worth the journey.    I brought along a PT NOOB to this show, and lets just say he's buying every PT album he can find right now.  I was totally impressed by the sound, it was so clear and you really could hear every nuance of the guitars, drums, bass, vocals, etc.  My ears were surprisingly not even ringing after the show.  They had a perfect blend going on where you could hear all the soft parts, then the ground would shake on the heavier, louder parts.  Kudos to the new Club Nokia venue on their advertised 'state of the art sound system'--even made Big F'n Elf (sorry not a fan) sound good...although lets not forget the whole PT crew, great sound like that takes a lot of people, time and effort all around.    So in summary, first buy this new PT album, then go see them live.    Whoa, almost forgot, Gavin is the most incredible drummer I've ever seen live--no exceptions!!!  Some of his fills were just sick, and if this guy isn't world renown yet, he will be...    Anyway, if you don't love this album after seeing/hearing it live there's something wrong with you.  I'm not a shrink, but seriously go find one, STAT! 'Cause damn, nothing pleases you and that's no way to live.  :)

0321544080|5.0|This book is more about the stories behind Joe's pictures and not about techniques or how this kind of pictures can be made. Here and there he gives some insights, mostly about the light used in the pictures (important stuff, I'm not saying, but most of us amateurs do not afford that kind of lighting equipment anyhow, nor are we willing to travel with it anywhere...). This being said, I have to say that I've enjoyed reading it quite a lot, and I do recommend it.
B001K3JF7K|5.0|An instant favorite album! If you liked The Look of Love, you'll love this. The string arrangements are more of the gorgeous and lush Claus Ogerman magic. Everything he touches becomes transcendent and ethereal. I don't care how many times I've heard these numbers growing up, he makes them anew. Very romantic, mellow and sultry. Diana's voice is intimate and sexy, rraarrrr! I've read the few critical reviews on Amazon and categorically disagree with each point made. It's easy for me to ignore their diatribe. Suffice to say everyone is different. If Diana and Claus teamed up to produced 20 albums like this, I'd order them unheard. Honest, it's that good!
1416594787|5.0|I bought the audiobook and the book. I listened to the book and it is great to hear Dawkins and his wife read, they are great readers and have excellent voices. The illustrations in the book are very helpful so that's why I bought the book too; but you don't necessarily need the illustrations for the audiobook. The book itself is an air tight case for evolution by natural selection. Being someone that is well read on evolution, I found out even more oustounding evidence by reading the Greatest Show on Earth. It debunks some of the ubiquitous misconceptions, and lays out the most convincing evidence from molecular genetics. The book purely lays out the science behind evolution, so even the religious reader would not feel like Dawkins is being overly antagonistic. This is an excellent book that needed to be written.
B002KLAL4W|2.0|I have to be honest with this review.  PJ has lost it musically with this album completly.  This product is a waste of money and I can't understand why Eddie Vedder even thought this might be worth creating.  I hate this record to the extreme and am a fan of the Jam from way back.  Some bands need to give it up and unfortunaly Pearl Jam is one of them.  If you want Pearl Jam at their best get Vs.  that is them at their finest.  Happy listening.....

B0015ABRE2|5.0|As always, Dexter thrills...just can't get enough of him. Jimmy Smits guest roll as Miguel Prado adds even more excitement and tension to the season.  Dexter is twisted, complex and frightfully engaging; a good serial killer that reaches out (through the screen) and draws you in to his world and mind; making you root for him, as he rids the world of dangers among us. The season 3 DVD collection enriches my personal DVD library.  Love it!

0385504225|5.0|If our educators cannot get, or most likely will not, get the un- or undereducated masses to learn about the `True History of America' and its founding, then why not teach it to them through a great novel.<br /><br />I love Dan Brown novels. I've read them all. His stories, while chocked full of history and fact, are spellbinding and cliffhangers.<br /><br />While I am not a Freemason, I have pondered the idea many times, because according to family legend, my paternal grandfather was a 33° Mason of the Scottish Rite. And there are other family legends that other family members were also high degree Masons. My greater family from southeastern Kentucky (only one slice of my several race genes) originated from Scotland in either the late 1700's or early 1800's by my paternal greatx4 grandfather John Kelly, who himself may have been a high degree Mason or highly influenced by Freemasonry.<br /><br />I think it unnecessary to retell the storyline of this novel here, since other reviewers have written a more than perfect synopsis. However, I would like to just say this and that is that anyone reading this novel should not be so quick to dismiss the ideas presented between the lines as the mere fantastic imaginations of the author.<br /><br />America was founded upon the Scottish Rite Masonic philosophy by high rank and file Freemasons. In fact, the very cornerstone of our Capitol building was laid in a Masonic ceremony by 33° Mason George Washington while dressed in full Masonic regalia. Also, the symbology that proves our Masonic founding beyond any shadow of a doubt is obvious on our currency, in our National Seal and on all of the Greco-Roman architecture throughout Washington D.C.  Dan Brown has illustrated this well, particularly as it pertains to our Nation's Capitol building.<br /><br />I repeat, I am not a Freemason, but I have studied its philosophy for many years and hold it to be a precious asset and Jewel hidden right in our midst. It contains the answers to almost all of the ancient prophesies pertaining to the way of the world, how things have been, are, and shall be; particularly those of Revelation and Nostradamus.<br /><br />For anyone desiring, after reading this book, to know more about the Truth of Freemasonry, rather than the lies and spin of `Conspiracy Theorists' should obtain this book and read and study it right along-side of scripture: [[ASIN:021726235X Morals and dogma of the Ancient and accepted Scottish rite of freemasonry]]. Having done that, sometime in the not too distant future, you will remember and appreciate Dan Brown's wonderful and revealing stories about what's really going on in this `tired old world' and what has been promised from `On-High' to correct it.ertaining to the way of the world, how things have been, are, and shall be; particularly those of Revelation and Nostradamus.

0307473473|5.0|The story takes place in Sweden and I initially thought that all the unfamiliar references to public business/political figures and geographic locations would make it difficult to follow the tale, but you're drawn in quickly. By the end, you come to appreciate the slight exposure to a landscape and cultural background that you are likely never to experience directly. And that's just the setting for the sometimes gruesome story. Some unusual characters that you don't expect to like, but do. It's well worth the effort. More than 600 pages might seem like a challenge, but once the story took hold, I finished it in a day and a half.
B001GCUO16|4.0|X-Men Origins: Wolverine<br /><br />For those who waited for this prequel to X-Men, it was worth every moment, every day of anticipation. For those who have never seen X-Men, well, this is a great place to start. In the grand tradition of the comic book, this edition features the origins of The Wolverine, the mutant who is at the core of the storyline.  I do not like to get into plot or storyline too heavily. I despise trailers with their 'let's show them the entire movie in split-second sequencing'. It's designed to monetize, not for the viewer. You'll not get that in my reviews either.<br /><br />There have been some excellent renditions of the `Batman', `Spider-man', and `Watchmen' series' in recent years. With just the right mix of CGI, storytelling, and acting, we have reached new levels in the way comic books are depicted on film. Director, Gavin Hood, has taken these tools and designed an outstanding issue in this, the third installment of the series. The bar now rests at a higher level for those who follow. I enjoy director's who compete with their peers. When they get it right, amazing results are often achieved.<br /><br />Like the original comic book series, a tale can be told with the flourish of great graphics, coupled with minimal, but carefully selected text, to achieve a creative and comprehensible story line. The great artist, Jack Kirby (Captain America, Fantastic Four), was the initial artist in the X-Men series. While not the creator of the `Wolverine' character, I believe he would have approved of the camera work in `Wolverine'. There is great stop action framing, perhaps homage to King Kirby. I also love the angles used in shooting. In many cases, the distant view of the entire scene is shown, much like in the comic books.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman stars as `Logan/Wolverine'. He is perfect in every frame. The effort that Jackman has put into this portrayal is clear. He has turned himself into a physical specimen rarely seen in a starring role since Bruce Lee in `Enter The Dragon'. Add to this his powerful ability to project dialogue in any manner and its clear Jackman is far beyond the coveted `triple threat' that most entertainers aspire to be. His turns onstage as `Curly' in Oklahoma, `Peter Allen' on Broadway, and film roles in `Van Helsing' and ` The Prestige' solidify that fact. For good measure, he was the song and dance, comedic host of the 2008 Academy Awards show.<br /><br />There is excellent supporting talent at every turn in this production. Liev Schreiber is particularly nasty as the `hell bent' Victor Creed. Musician, Will.i.Am,<br />Kevin Durand and Taylor Kitsch all lend nice supporting roles as well. I particularly liked Lynn Collins, as Logan's love interest Kayla.<br /><br />Dominic Monaghan (Lost) lit the way as mutant `Bolt'. He was joined by and `A-Team' group of mutants that put on an excellent display of their superpowers. Rounding out the team was Tim Pocock, Ryan Reynolds (as Hal Jordan/The Green Lantern' in production), and Daniel Henney. Their scenes epitomize what many comic readers love to see in the pages, action packed, and jaw dropping abilities. They did not disappoint here.<br /><br />Technical<br /><br />The Blu-ray edition is vibrant and exceptional at 1924 X 1080p, 120Hz. The sound is fine on all levels at 5.1, dts-HD.

First of all, it's visually impressive (though not absolutely mind-blowing as some have said...if you've seen a lot of animation, you've probably seen plenty of stuff this inventive), making some of the best use of rotoscoping (animated tracing over live-action figures, with animated backgrounds) that I've seen in a feature; it's got a fairly ambitious intellectual conceit (a man who may or may not be on the verge of death throughout the film dreams in a lucid way about what the nature of reality, consciousness, free will, etc really are); it's got great music (by Glover Gill)...what more could you want? Well, for starters, it works out to be not much more than philosophical ramblings, and I think to some extent it wears out its welcome. Now, if you knew me you'd know I often like long movies...I have no problem with a lot of work that a lot of people call \\"slow\\"; but this was to me too much of the same thing. And some of the observations are facile in a druggy-stoner way that just made me think, who cares?  Like pothead versions of Seinfeld and company, frankly.<br /><br />Still, adding it up, I'm thinking about it quite a lot since I first watched the excellent, feature-packed DVD a couple of years ago. Another aspect I really liked was the self-referentiality: the film as a whole is very reminiscent of the director's first feature, SLACKER; it contains a short scene with Jesse and Celine, the characters from the previous BEFORE SUNRISE that also obviously looks forward to the sequel to that film, BEFORE SUNSET; the technique used and some of the more fantastic imagery seems now a tryout for the director's later rotoscoped Philip K Dick adaptation, A SCANNER DARKLY; and both Linklater and his good friend (and fellow experimental-at-times filmmaker) Steven Soderbergh make appearances. And there's a scene or two late in the film that is reminiscent of the work of another extremely self-referential artist, the experimental American SF writer Samuel R. Delany (specificially, his 1000-page, Joycean \\"Dhalgren\\").<br /><br />I need to see it again; reading some pretty intelligent reviews this afternoon leads me to believe that a deeper reading would be more rewarding. Despite many reservations, I'm giving it high marks simply for attempting subject matter and film techniques that nobody else in America seems interested in. Linklater has proved himself a great disciple of European art cinema, not just the usual Scorsese-Coppola-DePalma stuff, and that's all to the good.uel R.

0545123267|5.0|I loved this book. It's the sweetest thing I've read in a while. I was prepared to cry, but I didn't; I loved every step. It was a truly amazing story, with wonderful supernatural elements included. The writing was great. Maggie is a wonderful writer. She makes the reader feel so much when reading.    The characters were incredible. I'm running out of praise for characters, specially for the lovable male character. Oh Sam, I loved Sam. I loved Grace too, she's a simple normal decision-making girl. The plot was superb, I never lost interest. Not once. It has a steady pace and one moment you are drooling because the romance is so yummy, and at the next minute you're turning the pages wanting to find out what happens, as if your life depends on it.    The cover is not one of my favorites but it suits the book quite well. For those Twilight fans, and those who love wonderful love stories with a supernatural edge, go pick this New York Times Best-selling title right now!

B002NYB712|5.0|I've read all the reviews, all written, apparently by PT fans.  It's interesting how a disc can generate everything from 1 to 5 stars among long time fans.  Some say it's a masterpiece.  Some say it's garbage.  I think the diversity comes when a band tries to stretch a bit.  It polarizes fans.  Some disagree that this is a stretch for the band, but I believe it is.  The tempo, the lyrics, the flow, all are different from previous efforts. Obviously from my headline I find it to be a masterpiece.  I can't stop listening to it.  Of course I have loved every PT record.  I think if this were the first disc a new PT listener ever heard, that person would say it's among the best music that person has ever heard.  Compared to other things out there, this is amazing.  There are some songs that are relatively weak compared to other songs on the record, but that will be true of practically any record.  One song will be the best and one will be the worst.  But this is a concept album and must be listened to as a whole.  In that light it is brilliant.  Perhaps it is because of where I am in my life (if Steven Wilson was born in '67 I am 6 years older than he is), but the lyrics really hit me.  A lot to relate to.  Blend those lyrics with superb musicianship and you have, for me at least, a masterpiece.
1594202249|1.0|I so rarely abandon anything... and here is my second stab at Pynchon back to the library after less than 1/4 way through (I bailed on Against the Day as well).     From allusions that ring as false as a jet contrail in an 1880's western movie to stilted dialogue, this book was just irritating.     If you buy into that ridiculous post-modern credo that difficult and obscure equals profound and \\"important\\" you might be able to stomach this drivel. If you prefer \\"homages\\" to detective novels to the real deal, knock yourself out.      On the other hand, try some James Lee Burke, and see how the real detective deal scans.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|I am a Viet Nam Vet, I was also a music major before I was drafted. I play this over and over and tears come to my eyes, goose bumps all over, and I am so moved by these two videos and cd I can only say wow.   If you said they make a political statement so be it, if you agree or don't you cannot denny that the mix of all of the singers and performers is superb. The combined tallent is great. The quality is above most music videos.  The message is simple, the world needs to become tan.  It is refreshing that tallent drives this video not special effects.  Just wow.
B00079018K|4.0|I bought this album in 2005 ans frankly didnt give it a fair go, I liked Reason is Treason, Club Foot and Cutt Off but hardly gave the rest a listen, then dug it out a week or so ago to listen in the car, and by jove, all of their songs that annoyed me before I am getting into, Processed Beats, LSF, Running Battle, all of which seem to have appeared in ads, on documentaries and football shows seeping into my consciousness ready for me to enjoy at the second time of asking. Yes, it sounds like Gorillaz in places, or BlocParty, but crap lyrics aside, they are strong songs that are performed well. Sometimes I think they overdo the cheeps and chirps a bit, you know like when you were at school doing a painting and you just keep adding a bit more to it, and suddenly, its ruined. AArgh. There is a bit of that here, I sometimes get a little vexed that in the middle of a good dance beat where Im getting a good head nodding vibe going, then they cut to an inappropriate quite bit. Small gripes though, hence the 3/8 short of a perfect score. This is a fun album, the band look like a bunch of clowns as well, and I supect they might actually be a bit knobbish, you know, like that one out of Razorlight. I Hope not. Dont let the fact that the band may, or may not, be a bunch of knobs spoil your enjoyment of this excellent album.
0316017922|5.0|In this book, Malcolm Gladwell sets out to debunk the idea that extraordinary success is something you have a lot of control over. I loved this book.  I loved it because it's INTERESTING. Part of the appeal is Gladwell's style. His writing is so crisp. More than the writing style though is the stories he tells...and the way he tells them. As occurred in both the [[ASIN:0316346624 The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference]] and in [[ASIN:0316010669 Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking]], Gladwell typically sets a scene, and then proceeds to identify a problem within it. In this case, it might be the reason  the Canadian Junior National Hockey team seems to have an over representation of players born in particular months...or why South Korea had a much higher incidence of plane crashes than other countries. Gladwell is the master of the hook, and then gradually prying you free. If you're looking for business insights from this book, they're harder to find than from his previous two best sellers. If you're looking for stuff that you shake your head at...smile...and like telling others about, this book is perfect.

B001LRJH0U|5.0|Appaloosa is a movie that will take you back in time when the west was still unsettled. Viggo Mortensen gives an excellent job of acting as does Ed Harris. The sets are excellent and the story is good. I think Ed Harris does a good job of direction as well. This is a very believable movie. The female heroine (Renee Zellweger) is not your perfect role model for a lady, but that is how things are in life.

B001993Y2C|5.0|There has been a lot said already about the dreadful packaging for this box set. mostly about the size. It is big, but here are the real problems you should know BEFORE you start watching. I assume like me you will watch the episodes in order. The fist mistake they made was the 4  accordian style boxes that house each season. The discs are so tightly packed, with no expansion room, that you will have no choice but to jam your fingers in, pinch the disc and try to pull it out. This will leave fingerprints on the readable side of the disc. Keep a cloth handy that is used for cleaning eye glasses, and wrap it around your fingers before trying to remove a disc. Check & wipe the disc before playing.     The 2nd mistake was NOT including a slip sheet showing what is on each disc. The back of the box gives 'some' indication, but doesn't say where things are. Therefore - go online and print an episode guide, there are lots available, and make your own notes as you go. I also will assume like me, you would watch any of the extended, unaired episodes rather that the broadcast version. Make note - Season 2, disc 2 ends with \\"Pegasus\\" - don't watch it like I did, because disc 3 starts with the extended unaired version of \\"Pegasus\\" and you won't know this from the packaging. Also in Season 3, disc 2 ends with \\"Unfinished Business\\" - don't watch it because disc 3 opens with the extended unaired version. Finally, Season 4, disc 3, the last one - the menu shows 3 'episodes' - 1st- Daybreak part 1, 2nd-Daybreak parts 2&3, and 3rd-Daybreak extended unaired. Maybe I'm a dolt, but it appeared to me the extended unaired covered parts 2&3 - so I watched the broadcast version of part 1, then chose the extended unaired option for 2&3 - WRONG. That option covers ALL 3 PARTS. So I watched the first part all over again, minutes after just completing it. A few more words on the menu could have better defined the content, or better still, that simple slip sheet explaining what's on each disc.These mistakes are just plain dumb for a major release such as this. Shame.
031606792X|5.0|I almost didn't read the series because of the reviews posted on here.  Good thing I decided to read it anyway.  Take these books for what they are - FANTASY.  At no time did the author state that we should look to these books as a moral guide or a place to find role models. If a parent allows their child to look for those things in a fantasy book then I question the parent not the book or the author.  As in all stories there's room for improvement.  But overall the series is great.  I enjoyed the culmination of the series with the final book, Breaking Dawn.    Things I enjoyed:  The Edward/Bella love story.      The Bella/Emmet arm wrestling scene.    Jacob forming his own pack.    The different vampires and their different talents.    Overall I recommend the book and the series.
0385504225|1.0|To be honest I couldnt wait to get my hands on this book when I heard it was coming out. Diligently picked up my copy on Sept 15th and quickly began to read... First few chapters had me hooked almost picking up where we left off with Langdon. As we progressed with the story line, it went from bad to worse till finally I couldnt wait to end the misery. I plowed through in agonizing pain, boring page after bland page. Written with Hollywood in mind, Mr. Brown tries to weave in unsuspected surprises, puzzles, and mysterious Orders. In my opinion, he fails miserably to recreate the plots of Da Vinci Code and A & D. He breeds the same lone bad guy, mentally twisted who torments Langdon to unlock puzzles around the city - only difference here is the 'surprise' at the end is lame and ambiguous, hardly justifing the 'adventure' that I endured for the past two days! Overall terrible book, a disappointing deviation from what was an otherwise 'good' trilogy.
0307346617|5.0|Because I was so jaded in my opinion of zombie fiction, for years, I let WWZ pass me by. For one reason or another, I found an excuse to not read it. When I finally broke down and sat down, I started tearing up for having let myself avoid it for so long.    The events transpire in retrospect with the \\"transcriber\\" explaining how this book came about. So we can understand from the very beginning, that things will eventually get better and order, following the war, will eventually be restored. However, we also know that, even from those opening pages, that things are going to get worse before they can get better and we are taken for quite the ride.    WWZ is nothing more (and I use \\"nothing more\\" somewhat tongue-in-cheek) than a series of first person vignettes. These personal accounts take the form of interviews with survivors following a world wide zombie pandemic. Simple, right? The individual tales, however, which these survivors share, although they are fictional, could very well be real people: the \\"interviews\\" are presented in such a way that these people share real issues, real emotions, and real problems (beyond the obvious aforementioned zombie outbreak). The reader can feel a genuine connection to, if not sympathy for these survivors.    WWZ is the most \\"human\\" zombie book I've ever read and probably the best in the genre I've come across in a very long time.
0240810961|5.0|Drawn to Life, Volume 1 is an excellent book for aspiring animators and artists who want to improve their craft and take their work to the next level. Walt Stanchfield was an incredibly influential animator and instructor at Disney Animation. His conversational notes have been passed on from animator to animator for over 30 years. With this volume, artists the word over can now benefit from his wealth of knowledge.<br /><br />He breadth of topics covered include major sections covering:<br /><br />The Principles of Animation<br /><br />Anatomy vs Gesture<br /><br />Seeing (observation and 'talking' to your audience through drawing)<br /><br />Action Analysis (Angles and tension, \\"essence\\" drawings)<br /><br />Creativity - going beyond the gesture<br /><br />Thinking - inspirational words of wisdom for artists<br /><br />This book is all meat, no filler. Be aware, it is NOT a paint-by-numbers book on how to draw. Walt's lectures provide a lot of food for thought for artists - it's a treasure trove of valuable information for students, teachers, and anyone who loves to draw. Reading this book, you will learn about drawing for animation, motion, acting, and the core of underlying animation principles. Walt's lectures are the quintessential refresher course for fine artists, sequential artists and film professionals.<br /><br />I am incredibly fortunate to have a copy of this book. It is written in a very conversational, and often times, humorous tone. There are several pictures and Walt's illustrations interspersed throughout the text, to clarify the author's talking points, but potential readers should bear in mind that this is primarily a text-heavy book.<br /><br />\\"Drawn to Life\\" is excellent for anyone who has a serious interest in drawing. You do not need to be in animation to appreciate the wealth of techniques and words of wisdom that are in within this book. Highly recommended for the serious artist. Highly recommended.
B00004S3AN|5.0|It´s impossible to buy this sacd in Spain (few of them are avalaible), but this version it´s amazing. Not hybrid version.
B002IVLH60|5.0|This is one of the more important albums of the year, maybe the most important. The reason this is only available as an import through amazon.com is a result of Pearl Jam releasing this CD 100% independent AND being unable to negotiate a distribution deal to their liking in the US (Universal is distributing to retail in the EU, which is where this is coming from if you buy from amazon in US). US customers can pick to buy the import through on-line retails, buy from the one big-box retailer (Target) Pearl Jam negotiated with to sell the CD in the US, buy from Indie music stores or buy through that Apple music store.    This is Pearl Jam's best album since Vs. no doubt... it is their consistent album to date in that EVERY song is excellent. It's not preachy, it's not loaded with downer songs, it's about reflection and just making solid rock'n roll old school style. If you've tired of the over-the-top political messages from Vedder, you'll find none of that hear... it sounds like the band is finally alive again (if you've ever been a fan, yes... it is THAT good).    Putting aside the great quality of the songs, the reason this album is so important is that it marks the first time I can recall a band of Pearl Jam's status (they still sell out medium size venues, almost 20 years after starting) breaking free from a record label and showing other established bands that \\"look you don't need a record  label\\"... Without a single penny of record label money, Pearl Jam: A. Hired an illustrator, hired a top-name producer, paid to record their album, secured a manufacturing deal, secured International distribution deals, successfully marketed their album (e.g. Tv ads, Rock Band video game tie-in, etc...), successfully booked a world tour.    Every dime put in is their investment, every dime gained will be their profit. And this is a beautiful thing for many reasons, but perhaps the two most important are A. Pearl Jam is 100% self-sustaining at this point, unlike any other band of their status, they are free to continue on as long as they like. They could put out another 20 albums and become the Rolling Stones of generation Y, but unlike the Stones (who have been very much held down by record labels not wanting to spend advertising on older acts) Pearl Jam needs no one except their fans... and they treat their fans like gold.  B. Each album from here forward we can count on being a work of art from the band. Lryics, arrangements, artist, etc... all reflective of the artist intentions without being tainted by record labels demands.    This is the model EVERY established band should follow... Because the record labels continue to throw established acts to the side in favor of whatever young talent they can profit the most from and take the most advantage of. I think Pearl Jam probably did this in part out of necessity to hold their integrity, but now that they've proven YES a band can take up the business side of things in the modern age and completely eliminate the big labels... well as Bob Dylan said \\"The times they are a changing\\".    This is a brilliant album, buy it now!
0812580346|5.0|When it comes to inspiration for TV shows, novels are not on the top of the list, though there are some exceptions.  Robert Sawyer's Flash Forward is one such exception, though a quick glance at the plot summaries of TV show and novel show some big differences.  Both, however, revolve around the idea of a simultaneous blackout of everyone on Earth, during which the victims are given a vision of the future.    In the novel, this vision is of a time over two decades away; on the TV show, this is shortened to around half a year.  The novel focuses on the scientists who may or may not have caused the incident; the TV show deals with non-scientists.    In Sawyer's book, the main character is Lloyd Simcoe, a physicist working at CERN, a Swiss science agency with a large particle collider.  Lloyd works with his fiancee Michiko Komura and fellow scientist Theo Procopides.  An experiment to create the elusive Higgs boson fails to create the particle but instead results in the blackout.    The initial effect is widespread disaster as people lose control of vehicles, surgeries are catastrophically interrupted and other such accidents.  Then, as people begin to piece things together, the questions begin.  What caused the blackout?  Is the future immutable?  For Lloyd and Michiko, there is a vision where they are no longer together; is there love doomed?  For Theo, there is a murder mystery:  he had no vision, and soon learns he was murdered a couple days prior to the Flash Forward.    Originally published in 1999 but taking place in 2009, Sawyer misses on some of his predictions; amusingly, one thing he gets right is that the Pope would be named Benedict.  As in the best hard science fiction, Sawyer raises a lot of interesting issues and keeps the reader entertained in the process.  Whether you watch the TV show or not, this book is well worth reading for science fiction fans.

B002GZQYMK|1.0|This is by no means Muse's best work, but it reaps the rewards like the Matrix sequels or Star wars prequels. And watch all the Muse fans click \\"unhelpful review\\" because I hurt them.     Uprising is an ugly pop song. It tries to compensate for its lack of energy with superficial clapping and pointless shouting (\\"hey\\",\\"Come on\\"). I cringe when Matt tries to fire up his audience with cries about \\"us\\" and \\"them\\". Its cheap and souless. The Dr Who theme is predictable of muse, the reptition is dissapointing but what really makes this sell out song terrible is that its not even good enough to be on radio. Within the confines of a pop instrumental, Matt's wailing voice sounds way too melodramatic and whiny.     The intro of Resistance could almost be superimposed with Citizen Erased. A rehash of old work. Resistance on the other hand is so bland melodically. And just in case you could be wrong the cheesy chorus makes sure you're right. It goes absolutely nowhere. Never builds, never changes, never climaxes.     And since Absolution, Matt has had this undisclosed desire to make mainstream music. Its obvious, as with every new album there is the inclusion of at least one hideously dumbed down track. Enter this Timbaland jingle which proceeds to cling to one idea, beating and spanking it. I'll admit the melody is actually catchy, but its paperthin. Im not totally against this sound, I just dont see the point unless Muse evolve it into something more unique.      Enter United States of Eurasia. You know it was kind of cool for muse to be thought of as the new Queen, but then to seal the deal with this blatant imitation is emabarrasing. It is pornographic in nature. Lyrically inept, completely literal in every sense with a rehash of past melodies. Predictable angular transitions but this time it feels like novelty.   And roll in with Lawrence of Arabia thematics... Lights camera action people. While I was once a great admirer of Muse's bombastic pompous sound, its potently staged here. Its like a Walt Disney ride where you realise the scenery is just wallpaper and the walls are made of styrofoam.    Guiding Light is a slow bellowing ballad in the way of songs like Blackout and Sing for Absolution from their earlier album. And as one can imagine from the cliche title its a self indulgent rompfest of eurotrash one liners. iIts romance as stale as cardboard cutouts, which fizzles out somewhere after the guitar solo anyway.     Unnatural selection proves that muse are somewhat throwing music at us any which way. Opening with organs, but why and with what purpose. The whole soundscape is just hot air, and subsequently the whole track lacks any real emotion. I hear a band like Arcade Fire (intervention) put to use the organ and one feels like it has purpose, like it opens ones palate the way good wine does during a main meal. But this song is just a pile of little league ideas. Matt even manages to sneak in a System of a Down-esque wallow which is insulting.    MK Ultra follows like Map of the Problematique. Opens with a pacey guitar jingle which sounds pretty cool but it suffers from a lack of variation and ultimately swallows itself whole into nothingness. A general theme in this whole album. And of course the guitar solo at the end is a rehash from live gigs. Are these guys getting lazy or are they trying ever so hard to be on radio. They dont do anything daring with it, all the while sounding completely ordinary.     I belong to you is probably Muse's best love ballad to date. Its something that might belong on Showbiz if they did that album again. Bouncy bassline and Matt's splintered angst. But its an interesting track which manages to change sounds repeatedly and all the while paints a rich landscape of sounds.    Exogenosis is not the saving grace. Although it is in another league compared to the rest of the album its still not the mammoth symphony I was hoping for. Its really just a rehash of sounds they've done before, including Microcuts, Butterflies and Hurricanes. Other parts are familiar melodies sourced from cinema. It is wonderous and I admire it in a lo-fi way but Im disappointed because Muse had the potential to really do something special with this. Butterflies and Hurricanes alone feels more grand and daring than this 15 minute symphony. And while Exogenosis does have the impact of making you feel like your riding the magic carpet through sands of history, it never overwhelms you with any climatic explosions or exotic delights. Part 3 Redemption makes for a beautiful melody, I cant help but take it literally... \\"lets start it over again\\".    But for all my criticisms it comes down to the simple fact that this album is not enjoyable. Its ok but its not great in the way I would want to listen to a particular song again and again.     There was a reason Muse resonated with me so much in the past, but to see them now make music that is universally non-offending, accessible to all ears, and is deliberately simple to capture the short attention of passers-by (at walmart, in the elevator, at work, while commuting) will not satisfy someone like me who makes the effort to actively listen to the album.            [...]
B002BSHWUU|5.0|The new remasters sound incredible, fantastic packaging and are a prayer answered for fans.    The only complaint is why not include both the stereo and mono mix for each album on the same disc (which could easily fit).    For the geek obsessed such as myself; once the mono set becomes available again, I'll be shelling out for that as well!
B002GZQYMK|5.0|I like quite a few releases from 2009 (Megadeth, Arctic Monkeys, Mars Volta, Green Day) but some took a few listens to get used to (and some still aren't clicking with me to be honest).<br /><br />I was a Muse fan from Black Holes and got this one as the special edition boxset from the UK.  It took FOREVER to arrive, but when it did I immediately pulled out the first LP and dropped the needle and cranked it.  From the get go I was blown away by how good this sounds.  Its VERY operatic and emotional (as you can expect from Muse) and really begs to be listened to cranked up on a real stereo.  Since my first listen I have listened to it a few more times and some of those times on lower dynamic systems (ie: computer, ipod earbuds) and its lost quite a bit of the power and feeling.  So please before you rate it poorly, listen to it on a proper hifi setup and it will work its way into your favor I promise.

B002FOQY04|5.0|THIS IS A LONG, DETAILED REVIEW (warning you beforehand).  My goal is after reading this it will inspire you to go buy the album and support Kid Cudi, and make him the next big artist.  The music truly is as good as I describe below....    Kid Cudi truly is the man on the moon, you can tell just by the beats on all 15 of the songs.  He combines so many elements from different music genres that no other artist sounds like him.  His lyrics aren't flawless, but at least he doesn't rap about bling-bling, killing \\"ni***s\\" in his music...and he only talks about \\"bi***es\\" in a few lines in his songs. The beats, messages, and value of each song more than make up for Cudi's simple lyrics, which by the way I love. Cudi's music is smooth, relaxing and just a privilege to listen to.  Cudi along with artists like: B.o.B, Wiz Khalifa, Charles Hamilton, Wale, and Curren$y are going to make hip-hop \\"alive\\" again.     Ok, I'll start off by saying the cover art is amazing, clever, and unique.....both covers for that matter.  I like the idea of it being a flip book instead of just a CD case with two sides, it feels much more authentic.  I tried playing the DVD on my computer but windows media won't pick it up, who knows why....I'm sure it's just my computer being idiotic.  So yeah the cover, design, and CD covers are all very well put together and look amazing.  The CD did not include the 3 bonus tracks, but after doing research....that's okay because I already had those months before, haha.  Onto the important part of this review, Cudi's great music.......    --1) In My Dreams (Cudder Anthem) - 7.5/10 - Very Slow, has an inspirational sound.   I could imagine hearing this song in some theatre as you walk in.  Maybe if I was a stoner and smoked, I'd appreciate it more.  It's a solid track/intro, not one of the better tracks on the CD.  --2) Soundtrack 2 My Life - 9.5/10 - Cudi talks about his life, and the way he is now.  The beat has an electric sound.  The chorus is amazing, and I sing it everytime I hear it.  It's just a great song, with great sound.  --3) Simple As... - 8/10 - Not going to lie, the first time I heard this song it was an instant skip to the next song.  After going back and actually giving each song a full listen this song was decent.  The beginning is odd, and kind of annoying, but you get used to it.  The track might throw you off, but once those drums go and the beat starts it's satisfying.  It's a feel good track.  --4) Solo Dolo - 7.5/10 - My least favorite track on the album.  That's not saying it's not good, because it is.  The track is just creepy, the beat is creepy, and it's slow.  The chorus saved the song for me, because it's catchy.  I also like the \\"Star Wars-like\\" beat throughout various parts of the song, it's nice.  The strings in the background of the chorus produce amazing sound.  So yeah, my least favorite track but it definitely has its strengths.   --5) Heart of a Lion (Kid Cudi Theme Music) - 9/10 - Love the way the song starts up with the piano.  The chorus showcases great electric sound.  The song is about perseverance, and moving on through difficult situations.  The song basically sums up what Kid Cudi is about, fighting through his struggle to prove the doubters wrong and produce this great music.  My favorite part of the song is the \\"NO-NO-NO-NO-NO-NO-NO-NOOOOO YEAHHHH,\\" I sing it everytime.   Solid track, with meaning.  --6) My World ft. Billy Cravens - 9/10 - Creepy, yet soothing at the same time.  The beat is on point.  \\"This will be my world...I told ya so,\\" this line basically sums up the whole song.   My favorite part is the 3rd verse (2:49 -3:14), Cudi raps over the beat that the song started off on, it's legit.  Relaxing, creepy, soothing = great track.  --7) Day N Nite - 10/10 - You've heard it, you love it, it's still amazing to this day.  I remember hearing this song and not wanting to like it because I thought the name \\"Kid Cudi\\" was pretty lame.  Time has passed since then, and now he's one of my favorite rappers.  The video is trippy, the song is great, and will continue to be great in years to come.  --8) Sky Might Fall - 10/10 - I LOVE the drums used in this song, you can't help but bob your head while listening.  I can relate a lot to this song with lines like \\"Grey clouds up above mayne, metaphor to my life mayne,\\" and the chorus: \\"The sky might fall, but I'm not worried at all.\\"  The beat is great, and the song has meaning.  Just an amazing song.  --9) Enter Galactic (Love Connection Part 1) - 10/10 - The beat is ummmm.....INSANE.  It fits perfect with the song title, the message, and with Cudi himself.  He's the man on the moon, and this is the perfect space beat.  It's a song about love: \\"enter galactic, you and me.\\"  Favorite line of this song is: \\"I want to kiss you on your space below your navelette, the place you keep so neat, so moist, like a towelette.\\"  It's pretty funny at least to me.  This very well might be my second favorite song on the album.  --10) Alive ft. Ratatat - 15/10 - AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING.  Ratatat I don't know who your are or know much about you, but DAMN you did work making this beat.  I heard this song on a website and it made me want to buy this album.   The beat is unique and un-like anything ever made before.  The drums, electric sound, everything about it makes the beat so authentic, and makes you want to listen to it over and over.  \\"Everytime the moon shines, I become alive,\\" sums up everything about Cudi.  This track is by far my favorite on the album, and saying that on an album so amazing like this is quite a feat.  --11) Cudi Zone - 9.5/10 - So close to giving this a 10/10 because the beat and especially the chorus is amazing.  The chorus might be the most enjoyable chorus out of all the songs on the CD.  But something is lacking for it to be in the 10/10 class, who knows what it is.  This track is a banger though, can't stop listening.  --12) Make Her Say ft. Kanye West/Common - 9.5/10 - This track is a 10, well it would've been if they didn't let Lady Gaga have her own part in the song.  Like Day N Nite, by now you're heard and loved this track.  Kanye's verse is clever, and so is Commons, they add greatness to the track.  So yeah a 10 track if the hermaphrodite didn't have her own little part other than the chorus.  --13) Pursuit of Happiness ft. MGMT/Ratatat - 8/10 - The Cudi/Ratatat duo is unique, lethal and great, I look forward to future tracks.  This song just doesn't have the same flare as \\"Alive\\" does, none of the tracks do (it's that great).  I heard this will be his next single, solid choice, but this is one of the bottom third tracks on the album.  It's great, catchy, but isn't one of the better ones.    --14) Hyyerr ft. Chip Tha Ripper - 8/10 - The definition of relaxing.  I have a feeling this might be the stoners who buy this album's favorite track.  It's a lay-back feel good track, almost makes me want to toke up (kidding).  It's a slow tune, but it's a great change of pace at the end of the album.  Hyyerr goes into the final track \\"Up Up & Away\\" and to me that's a clever pairing....you get hyyerr until you're up up & away, haha.  Good track, relaxing, enjoyable.  --15) Up Up & Away - 10/10 - AMAZING way to end off a glorious CD.  The song leaves me wanting more, and makes me speculate what's next for Kid Cudi.  The song has an acoustic feel, with space-like beat in the background.  The song is also referred to as the \\"wake & bake song.\\"  I said earlier Enter Galactic might be my 2nd favorite song, but this song is just as good.  \\"I'll be up up & away, cuz they `gon judge my anyways,\\" sends a good message even though Cudi is really talking about getting high.  The real message is do what you want to do, don't worry about what others will say or think, because they'll hate either path you choose to walk.  Great ending, great song, great album, great artist.    Cudi truly is a one of a kind artist that does things his way.  His way is unique, soothing, and produces great music.  If \\"artists\\" like Soulja Boy, LiL'Wayne, and LiL'Jon can sell millions of album copies there is no excuse why this album shouldn't do the same.  This album should win Album of the Year, or at the very least be nominated.  Every track from beginning to end is great, some greater than others obviously, but each still have staying power in the end.  Go out and support a REAL artist, that makes great music.  Thank you Mr. Solo Dolo for this masterpiece you made in the studio, you have me convinced.  Buy this people, you won't be sorry.
0545128285|3.0|I absolutely love the Harry Potter series, but I was a little disappointed by J.K. Rowling's newest feature. Rowling's illustrations are fantastic and adds to the lacking flavor in The Tales of the Beedle and the Bard, but short little wizard children's stories seem to be just thrown together and they're lacking J.K. Rowling's unique humor. As a huge fan I had to buy it to add to my collection, but if you're just looking for a quick read I would recommend going to you're local library to read this. Frankly, it's not really worth the $10 and I was kind of disappointed.
B000ZECQ08|4.0|First, the flaws.  The waitress scene in the beginning was unnecessary and took away from other elements that should have been included.  More time at the joke shop would have been good.      The fire at The Burrow was well done, and added another dimension to the movie.  However, the only inkling we got of the relationship between Lupin and Tonks was her calling him sweetheart just before the attack.  Very jarring, even for those of us who knew they were a couple.    There were a lot of scenes that were very well done, but what made the movie for me was Dumbledore.  Michael Gambon finally got the character right and just in time.  His interpretation of our beloved headmaster in the previous movies left me cold, and I was concerned that I wouldn't care about the character's final fate.  Not so.  Those final scenes were everything I could have wished.
0439023483|5.0|I just finished this book today.  I bought it after reading some of the reviews and description that made it seem very similar to the Battle Royale book I read years ago by Koushun Takami.  Only, this book is told through the eyes of one main female character.  If you loved BR, you'll love this too.  I'm intrigued to find more about the overall situation their world is in after reading this first book.  Already bought the 2nd novel...will start on that soon.

0385504225|4.0|Six years and a million conspiracy theories later, Dan Brown finally gives us his new novel, \\"The Lost Symbol.\\" As with \\"The DaVinci Code\\" and \\"Angels and Demons,\\" the plot revolves around rare symbologist Robert Langdon. Noetic scientist Katherine Soloman accompanies Langdon as they chase ancient and mystical powers around Washington, D.C.<br /><br />As with a number of Brown's novels, there is a lone antagonist who seeks these treasures as well. Mal'akh, a self-tattooed beast of a human, tortures and kills the innocent as he hunts for the final piece to his personal transformation. He turns out to be the most evil and intricate villain that Brown has ever presented.<br /><br />The novel starts with Langdon flying to D.C. to present a lecture at the invitation of his mentor and friend Peter Soloman. However, when Langdon shows up to give his presentation, he realizes something is terribly wrong. Then we are taken on a fantastic trek that takes us deep into the very roots on which this country was founded.<br /><br />With each chapter we are taken to a different location of the action. In one particular scene, we are shown two different vantage points of what is occurring, which turns out to be extremely terrifying. In one viewpoint we see Ms. Soloman stumbling around in a massive pitch-black structure trying to escape her pursuer, Mal'akh. Then with the next chapter, we are taken into the mind of this devil as he attempts to capture Ms. Soloman and perform unspeakable acts against her.<br /><br />The societies portrayed are the Freemasons (led by Mr. Soloman), like the Knights Templar in \\"The DaVinci Code\\" and the Illuminati in \\"Angels and Demons.\\" Brown shows particular kindness towards them and explains they are misunderstood only because of the secretive nature of the society's members.<br /><br />Twists and turns fill this novel, as much as the use of italicized words. This proved annoying at times, to the point where I began counting how many italic words there were per chapter. Maybe it was for those who needed guidance, but I believe any sane person would have understood words like \\"within\\" and \\"staircase.\\"<br /><br />One particular aspect that makes Brown's novel interesting are the various landmarks used ranging from the Capitol Building to the Washington Monument, which are used to demonstrate Langdon and his female counterpart's aptitude for interpreting signs and symbols that our forefathers plastered on every structure in our nation's capitol. Each facet of the landmark came with an extensive explanation or argument that proved tiresome at times. But that is what I have come to expect from Professor Langdon.<br /><br />It can be said that many of Brown's novels are similar. This is, in my belief, Brown's main pitfall as a novelist. Predictability of actions, moments and ideas caused me to realize the final irony of the whole adventure while only halfway through the book. Still, it was the means of getting there that make this his best piece of work to date.was for those who needed guidance, but I believe any sane person would have understood words like \\"within\\" and \\"staircase.\\"      One particular aspect that makes Brown's novel interesting are the various landmarks used ranging from the Capitol Building to the Washington Monument, which are used to demonstrate Langdon and his female counterpart's aptitude for interpreting signs and symbols that our forefathers plastered on every structure in our nation's capitol.

1891252089|5.0|Of the many Ashtanga yoga teachers I have had the good fortune to study with, David Swenson is the best. This book is a MUST HAVE, even if you have a regular Ashtanga teacher in your area, which of course many people do not. Each pose of the primary and second series is thoroughly explained, with helpful commentary and suggestions for modifying each posture to make it more appropriate for your strength and flexibility level. There is also a helpful section on the philosophy behind the system. Your local teacher does not have time to go into this much detail in a regular class, but gaining the insight that David shares in this book is extremely helpful for taking your practice to a deeper level and broadening your understanding of the practice, whether you are a beginner or an experienced practitioner. And if you don't have a local teacher, this book is invaluable. As an added bonus, it is spiral bound, so it will sit open on your floor and you can refer to it while you practice.
B001NLL0RW|5.0|I am a fan of James Rollins and his Sigma Series, It's a good hybrid of Tom Clancy & Dan Brown, a good mix of military thriller & historic/religious fiction
1933771690|2.0|This book started well but then went nowhere.  It repeatedly hammered the point that consciousness must be accounted for in order to construct a complete scientific view of the world, but failed to explain how to go about doing this.  An example equation or two incorporating consciousness based variables would have been a good start.  I also take exception to linking quantum collapse exclusively to \\"consciousness\\" rather than just \\"observation\\".  That said, I do believe that Lanza is on to something that warrants more rigorous investigation.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Great book as only Dan Brown can do, I bought this on my kindle and had it finished in a couple of days. Couldn't put it down for long, and spent a lot of time on the internet looking up places and statues in Washington DC to follow the story line better. If you like the Divinci Code you will like this book.
0385504225|3.0|I am in the middle of The Lost Symbol a the moment, yes i have not fiished it yet.  I just felt compelled to share some of my feelings.  First of all Dan Brown is not a writers writer; he is not creating some grand piece of literature here.  He aims for suspense over substance and at times his style is a bit sophomoric. Lets face it the formula for The Lost Symbol, is the same as it was in The Davinci Code and Angels and Demons.  Aren't authors supposed to grow and change with time and experience? His characters are not likeable at all, however having said that how can he really flesh out his characters when he spends most of his time trying to educate us about the Apotheosis of Washington and the vastness of Freemasonry?  Quite honsetly I find his writing style hokey, especially the villanous parts.  Every time I get to the chapters with Mala'kh I roll my eyes and skim through.<br />Obviously Dan Brown has learned that once something works, don't stray.  He's not offering us anything new here except location.

B000002LCK|5.0|Like Joy Division, New Order's singles as a rule didn't appear on their albums. Unlike Joy Division, New Order's singles were nearly always their best songs. All of this makes 'Substance' an essential collection for serious New Order fans, as well as being the best place to start for casual fans. 'Substance' covers that band's most consistent and creative period, beginning with the final Joy Division song 'Ceremony' and ending with 'True Faith', which would become one of their biggest hits.     The first CD consists of New Order's singles from 1981-1987, containing all of their most important songs: 'Ceremony', 'Temptation', 'Blue Monday', 'Perfect Kiss', 'Bizzare Love Triangle', 'True Faith'. Apart from new recordings of 'Temptation' and 'Confusion' (both of which are superior to the original versions), these are all the original extended 12\\" mixes. This does mean a couple of songs drag on a little, but the quality of the music is so high that most of the time you won't care. While every song has a clear electronic and dance/rock influence, there is still considerable diversity here: the post-punk of 'Ceremony', the vaguely hip-hop 'Confusion', the blue-eyed soul of 'Thieves Like Us', the football chant of 'Shellshock'. The only dud is the 12\\" mix of 'Subculture', which is a shocker, marred by annoying backup singers and unnecessary studio affects. The 7\\" version on 'Low Life' is vastly superior to this.    The second CD consists of all the B-sides, and as with Joy Division's 'Substance', there are some real hidden gems here. About half the tracks are take-it-or-leave-it remixes and instrumentals of the A-sides, but there are 7 original songs. Beginning with the unsettling 'In a Lonely Place', it includes 'Procession' and 'Mesh' (actually 'Cries and Whispers')from the Movement sessions, the industrial-tinged 'Hurt', and a pair of decent pop/rock tracks in 'Lonesome Tonight' and '1963'. The most interesting song here is the disturbing 'Murder', a chaotic tribal songthat sounds like it belongs a horror movie soundtrack.     In all, this is the best collection of New Order songs around. The 12\\" mixes really highlight the impact New Order's early work had on dance and electronic music, whereas most other collections present songs in the more radio-friendly 7\\" mixes. And given the band's singles were their best tracks, there are no weak spots or embarassing moments which plague a couple of the studio albums. This is simply a great collection of innovative dance/rock music, and arguably New Order's best ever release.

0385504225|4.0|I enjoyed this book immensely. It was full of suspense and I couldn't put it down. The research was amazing and meticulously done. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I didn't figure anything out, because I didn't want to. I went along for the ride and kept turning the pages. I think this is Dan Brown's best book to date. It is evident that because of his fame, he gained access to some places that most of us never knew existed. I always wondered what the Masons were all about. Whether he revealed any secrets or he made it up, it was a fascinating read. I want to go to Washington for the inevitable \\" Lost Symbol Tour \\".
031606792X|5.0|I've enjoyed the first three books in the Twilight saga - and was not disappointed in the fourth (final?) book.  I found this book as hard to put down as the others in the series - and the author's descriptions were, as usual, such that you felt you were right there, watching it all unfold. I'm really hoping that there will be more books in this series!
0061719544|3.0|As another reviewer mentioned, the novel's voice really did get bogged down in minutiae that broke the usual flow of Mr. Ferguson's style of writing.  I started feeling like I was reading a who's who of everyone he ever bumped into, distracting me from the actual point he was trying to make/the story he was trying to tell.  I'm definitely a fan of his overall work, but I thought this book came up a wee bit short in the substance department.

If there is one thing that is consistent with the series is that the writing has always been top notched since the very first episode and most importantly, the cast has been quite awesome for the series.  The series has been nothing but a pleasure to watch and see Betty's journey as a professional but also in her personal life.  Everything seems to come together and work.<br /><br />With this third season, there is quite a bit of laughter, typical backstabbing but even more emotional, dramatic scenes.  The season finale for this third season of \\"UGLY BETTY\\" was very well done and the best so far.<br /><br />Of course, this season had a lot of hype with what went on behind-the-scenes between Lindsay Lohan and the cast and crew.  Whether or not the gossip surrounding what took place behind-the-scenes were true or not, the gossip definitely made people want to turn in to see this rivalry between Betty and Kimmie.  Another actor who brought some interest in the show was \\"Karate Kid\\" actor Ralph Macchio who played the city councilman that Hilda was interested in.  Pretty interesting role and hopefully we see more of him.<br /><br />The third season also had featured episodes that had focused on character development of Marc, Amanda and Claire's character.  Also, the other characters brought in to the series helped bring out emotions that we have never seen from our main characters.  For example, Molly brought out the best in Daniel Meade.  In fact, this season was a dramatic season for Daniel as he had to deal with a custody battle, a family member who may go to prison and then facing loss.  It was good to see Daniel being put through these rollercoaster type of events.<br /><br />Last but not least, this DVD release of \\"UGLY BETTY - The Complete Third Season\\" is solid.  I found the featurettes such as the \\"Mode After Hour\\" web episodes and the \\"Coming Home to New York City\\" cool special features but also seeing the \\"Look Who Keeps Popping Up\\" video commentary.  I hope in the next season's DVD release, we get more of that.<br /><br />Overall, there's nothing negative I can say about this season of \\"UGLY BETTY\\".  Last year, was hit by the Writer's Guild Strike and thus shortened to 18 episodes but fortunately, this third season, the move to New York, solid acting performances and writing definitely made this season the best in the series thus far.<br /><br />\\"UGLY BETTY\\" fans, \\"UGLY BETTY - The Complete Third Season\\" is highly recommended!rious episodes featuring what they do at Mode after hours.

Disc 6:        * Coming Home to New York City - (12:43) We learn how \\"UGLY BETTY\\" is shot in Los Angeles but how the series moved to New York and how the cast found out that the show is moving to another location and how they all reacted.

JUDGMENT CALL:    \\"UGLY BETTY\\" continues to have another solid, stellar year with season 3.  If there is one thing that is consistent with the series is that the writing has always been top notched since the very first episode and most importantly, the cast has been quite awesome for the series.  The series has been nothing but a pleasure to watch and see Betty's journey as a professional but also in her personal life.  Everything seems to come together and work.    With this third season, there is quite a bit of laughter, typical backstabbing but even more emotional, dramatic scenes.  The season finale for this third season of \\"UGLY BETTY\\" was very well done and the best so far.    Of course, this season had a lot of hype with what went on behind-the-scenes between Lindsay Lohan and the cast and crew.  Whether or not the gossip surrounding what took place behind-the-scenes were true or not, the gossip definitely made people want to turn in to see this rivalry between Betty and Kimmie.  Another actor who brought some interest in the show was \\"Karate Kid\\" actor Ralph Macchio who played the city councilman that Hilda was interested in.  Pretty interesting role and hopefully we see more of him.    The third season also had featured episodes that had focused on character development of Marc, Amanda and Claire's character.

B001GCUO16|4.0|With the X-Men films becoming too expensive to feature all its stars, it has become more logical to focus on the storyline of each of the main characters.  And what best than to feature one of the more popular characters in the Marvel and X-Men universe, Wolverine.<br /><br />Taking the helm as director is actor, Gavin Hood (\\"Thug\\", \\"The Storekeeper\\" and \\"Stas and Nel Adventures\\"), with a screenplay by David Bennioff (\\"The Kite Runner\\", \\"Troy\\") and Skip Woods (\\"Hitman\\" and \\"Swordfish\\").  Joining the men is composer Harry Gregson-Williams (\\"Deja Vu\\", \\"Shrek the Third\\" and \\"Gone Baby Gone\\") and cinematographer Donald McAlpine (\\"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\", \\"Peter Pan\\", \\"Anger Management\\" and \\"Moulin Rouge!\\").<br /><br />\\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\", the Blu-ray Ultimate 2-Disc Edition comes with two discs.  The main disc is the Blu-ray, while the second disc is a digital copy.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition with an AVC @ 22MBPS.  The picture quality is quite solid with the skin pores of both Hugh Jackman and Liev Schrieber coming quite nicely on the HD transfer.  The grittiness, the sweat, the grime,  the vibrancy is also well-captured in the film.  Blacks are nice and deep and with the film being shot outdoors, the areas that Logan visit are quite detailed. I didn't see any compression artifacts or major scratches or dust on the video transfer.<br /><br />The audio is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (also English, Spanish and Portuguese 5.1 Dolby Digital and French 5.1 DTS).  The lossless audio track is absolutely awesome.  From Zero's gunfire, Logan's adamantium claws making the \\"snickt\\" sound, Wade's swords as it deflects the bullets and Victor's attacks and his growls, it's all captured and sounds incredible.  Also, there are plenty of action-scenes that really showcase the surround channels and a good amount of LFE is utilized.  From the explosions to the gunfire, home theater owners should be happy with the Blu-ray lossless soundtrack as some scenes sound quite immersive.<br /><br />As expected, Twentieth Century Fox has done a great job with the video and audio transfer for \\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\".  Subtitles are presented in English SDH, Spanish, Cantonese, Mandarin and Portuguese.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />\\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  * Commentary by Gavin Hood - Audio Commentary by the director Gavin Hood.  For the most part, Hood does a great job in providing the details to the film.  A very informative audio commentary.<br />  * Commentary by Producers Laura Schuler Donner and Ralph Winter - There are some interesting details about certain scenes and what went on to create those scenes via the producers perspective.  The only problem is that Donner and Winter have too many silent moments in where they are not talking.  So, it can be a bit distracting.<br />  * The Roots of Wolverine: A Conversation with Stan Lee and Len Wien - (16:16) Both Stan Lee and Len Wien discuss the X-Men, Wolverine as a character, Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and the history of the character. An informative featurette in regards to the comic books.  For some reason, I felt that Stan Lee was not his jovial self.<br />  * Wolverine Unleashed: The Complete Origins - (12:02) Interviews with the director, producers, Hugh Jackman in regards to shooting the film, origins of Wolverine, training, making his claws and the set.<br />  * Weapon X Files - This segment features each talent in character talking about themselves and then we hear from the director/producer about what they wanted to accomplish with their character and special effects that went into the making of that character.  Probably my favorite was the featurette on Kevin Durand's Blob and what went into making the fat suit.<br /><br />- Victor Creed/Sabretooth (7:25)<br /><br />- William Stryker (4:25)<br/><br />- John Wraith (4:15)<br /><br />- Kayla Silverfox (3:26)<br /><br />- Fred Dukes/Blob (7:18)<br /><br />- Bradley (3:18)<br /><br />- Remy Lebeau/Gambit (9:08)<br /><br />- Agent Zero (3:45)<br /><br />- Wade Wilson/Deadpool (7:10)<br /><br />- Emma (Kayla's Sister) (3:25)<br /><br />  * The Thrill of the Chase: The Helicopter Sequence - (5:53) The making of the helicopter sequence.<br />  * Ultimate X-Mode - While watching the film, viewers can watch the director, producers and cast talking about the film via picture-in-picture.<br />  * Deleted & Alternate Scenes - (9:30) With optional commentary by director Gavin Hood, Hood introduces four deleted and alternate scenes which include: Young Storm, Victor at the boxing ring, Alternate Memory Erase Sequence and a Japanese Bar Scene.<br />  * Fox Movie Channel Presents: World Premiere - (6:20) The \\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\" debut in Tempe, Arizona (The contest winners of where the red carpet premiere took place).<br />  * X-Men on Blu-ray: Trailers for X-Men Trilogy and \\"Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian\\".<br />  * BD-Live Lookup - With a BD-Live enabled Blu-ray player, viewers can access up-to-date information on actor filmographies, information related to \\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\" on imdb (The Internet Movie Database).<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />I literally grew up with the \\"X-Men\\" and \\"Wolverine\\" comic books when I was younger.  During the 80's, you had your American superheroes but Wolverine represented a character that was just exciting, deadly and literally kickass.<br /><br />Since the release of the three X-Men films, I have no doubt in my mind that Hugh Jackman was the best casting decision made for the character.  He embodies the character completely and the amount of discipline he puts in working out and being Logan is just incredible and it shows in \\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\".<br /><br />For the most part, the film is full of action and full of characters.  The excitement is there, the killer instinct of both Logan and Victor are there and of course, we have pre-Deadpool Wade Wilson in the film as well, along with many other characters that makes this film fun and exciting.  And to feature a storyline that revolves around Logan's origin is not easy.  After all, having followed the comic books for so long, I think even writers had their challenge of how the Weapon X program would be and even today, just seeing how things have evolved with the program is just staggering.  So, before watching the film, I did have my reservations of how muddled the plot could be.<br /><br />Fortunately, the filmmakers took a different approach and created their own storyline with some aspects of the comic book still part of the storyline.  Keeping things simple and for the most part, for those who are not familiar with the comic books, at least exciting enough to understand where Logan came from and why he and Victor have had this dysfunctional relationship.<br /><br />For the most part, Jackman is just great as Logan/Wolverine and Liev Schreiber can always play the definitive bad ass.  Danny Huston as Stryker was quite effective and Lynn Collins as Kayla Silverfox did a great job as well.  As for Taylor Kitsch (\\"Friday Night Lights\\") as Remy Lebeau/Gambit, that was quite interesting but for the most part, I felt that Kitsch did a good job albeit the thick French accent that Gambit exhibits in the comic books and people are so used to hearing from the X-Men animated series.  The others have small roles such as \\"LOST\\" and \\"Lord of the Rings\\" actor Dominic Monaghan as Bradley and Black Eyed Peas member Will.i.am also ventures to the acting world, appearing onscreen (instead of voice as he did in \\"Madagascar 2').  But one of the exciting parts of this film was seeing the Blob (Kevin Durand) and of course, Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds).  It was great to see on the Blu-ray of how they came up with the Blob's outfit and of course, having Wade Wilson in the film.It's important to note that if you are a fan of Wade Wilson, make sure you watch through the ending credits.<br /><br />With all my gushing about how much I enjoy this film, one must wonder if I have any negatives.  Well, what I didn't like about the film was the overuse of CG, in which some scenes looked a bit too unrealistic.  Also, the tweaking of the Wade Wilson character was a bit too much for my taste.  I can understand some hardcore fans who may have a problem with the comic book continuity and how the film has quite a few differences but personally, many super hero films has its differences from its comic book counterpart that its not surprising anymore.  As long as the soul of the characters are intact and the storyline is well-presented, it's good enough for me.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, the film definitely gets a wonderful HD transfer as picture and audio quality is solid.  A good number of special features are included, as well as a slipcase and a digital copy of the film.<br /><br />With that being said, \\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\" is a good superhero film with a lot of action.  Was it as deep and entertaining like \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\", my answer is no.  But I definitely enjoyed it more than the third X-Men film and even the \\"Hulk\\" related films.  I felt that the storyline focused on Logan/Wolverine, his rivalry with Victor Creed quite well.  If anything, it's the CG that tends to be overdone at times that bothered me a bit but for the most part, I did enjoy watching the film.<br /><br />But after watching the awesome Blu-ray version and seeing the film in High Definition and watching the special features, that actually enhanced my perspective towards the film.  A lot went into the making of this film and to see that Hugh Jackman did most of his own stunts, that is incredible.<br /><br />Overall, if you are a fan of Wolverine and the previous X-Men films, definitely give \\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\" a try.  Definitely worth recommending!nd to feature a storyline that revolves around Logan's origin is not easy.

B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Witty, suspenseful and fresh!  The first season of \\"CASTLE\\" is the modern \\"Moonlighting\\" featuring a cool cast and each episode with an entertaining storyline.<br /><br />\\"CASTLE\\" debuted on ABC as a mid-season replacement and began airing on March 2009.  Created by Andrew M. Marlowe (\\"Air Force One\\", \\"End of Days\\" and \\"Hollyw Man\\") and executive produced by Rob Bowman (\\"The A-Team\\", \\"The X-Files\\", \\"Day Break\\") comes a new drama series on crime solving.<br /><br />The first season which featured 10 episodes stars actor Nathan Fillion (\\"Firefly\\", \\"Drive\\" and \\"Desperate Housewives\\") as Richard Castle.

The drama series is quite slick as it gives you the feel of New York and like many abc studios related DVD releases, Disney has always done a good job with their TV show transfers.  A show that balances outdoor and indoor shots with good lighting, the picture quality for \\"CASTLE\\" is pretty solid.  I didn't see any major artifacting issues or low level noise that was distracting.<br /><br />As for the audio, the series is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.  The series is front and center channel driven with a few episodes (that involve gun fights) utilizing the surround channels.  The series does utilize quite a bit of music and for the most, the series is understandable and clear.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"CASTLE - The Complete First Season\\" includes the following special features:<br /><br />DISC 1:<br /><br />  * Audio Commentary for \\"Flowers For Your Grave\\" with Executive Producer Andrew Marlow, Executive Producer Rob Bowman, Actors Nathan Fillion, Stana Katic and Jon Huertas<br /><br />DISC 2:<br /><br />  * Audio Commentary for \\"A Chill Goes Through Her Veins\\" with Executive Producer Andrew Marlow, Executive Producer Rob Bowman, Actors Nathan Fillion, Stana Katic, Jon Huertas and Molly Quinn<br /><br />DISC 3:<br /><br />  * Audio Commentary for \\"A Death in the Family\\" with Executive Producer Andrew Marlow, Executive Producer Rob Bowman, Actors Nathan Fillion, Stana Katic, Jon Huertas and Molly Quinn<br />  * Audio Commentary for \\"A Death in the Family\\" with Seamus Dever and  Jon Huertas<br />  * Whodunit: The Genesis of Castle -(6:15) Andrew Marlowe talks about how he came up with the idea of \\"Castle\\".

Cannell.<br />  * Misdemeanors: Bloopers & Outtakes - (2:37) First season bloopers.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"CASTLE\\" was definitely a surprise.  I can remember seeing the commercials during \\"LOST\\" but and for the most part, it kind of reminded me of the old \\"Moonlighting\\" years of crime investigation.  But after watching the first episode, I was instantly hooked.<br /><br />Both Rick Castle and Detective Kate Beckett are just polar opposites but you know that there is this sexual attraction there that makes their chemistry work onscreen.  In a way, both are like Bruce Wayne (Batman) in the way they are keen in investigating things.  Castle, as a mystery writer and having done a lot of research, puts himself in the shoes of the criminal and thinks of the many possibilities that can exist between the characters.  Detective Beckett, almost having a similar tragic Bruce Wayne story is a by-the-book detective and for the most part, have their unique way of feeding off each other in terms of handling a case.  But Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic do a great job and have good chemistry onscreen.<br /><br />So, far every episode has been intriguing, suspenseful and entertaining.  If there was one thing that tends to creep in my head that is more on the negative side, is just the serious aspects of a popular writer getting the opportunity to tag along a detective on her various cases.  I just have a hard time seeing the NYPD allowing such a thing and allowing a writer to get that close to the detectives.<br /><br />Granted, this may seem a bit farfetched but overall, the writers make it work.  Each of the characters are actually quite enjoyable to watch, especially Castle's meddling mother Martha and logical and intelligent daughter Alexis,  it's good to see Castle pulled out of his element once in awhile. Beckett's partners Detective Esposito and Ryan lend that serious but also comedic moment for the series.<br /><br />The first season of \\"CASTLE\\" has been quite enjoyable thus far.  I'm glad to hear that the series has been green lighted for a second season because \\"CASTLE\\" has been nothing but entertaining, fun and a suspenseful drama series thus far.<br /><br />\\"CASTLE - The Complete First Season\\" is definitely worth checking out!c, Jon Huertas and Molly Quinn      * Audio Commentary for \\"A Death in the Family\\" with Seamus Dever and  Jon Huertas      * Whodunit: The Genesis of Castle -(6:15) Andrew Marlowe talks about how he came up with the idea of \\"Castle\\".

I'm glad to hear that the series has been green lighted for a second season because \\"CASTLE\\" has been nothing but entertaining, fun and a suspenseful drama series thus far.    \\"CASTLE - The Complete First Season\\" is definitely worth checking out!
0307454541|4.0|There are so many convoluted subplots in this thriller, each of them showing at best, moral compromises of the characters, at worst, no regard for human or other forms of life, that you feel drained when you're finished with it.  While the antagonists in each subplot are truly evil, none of the main characters are truly good, so the reader is constantly overwhelmed by the seedier side of human nature.<br />Kudos for Larsson for having been a journalist who questions journalistic ethics.  It is too infrequently a subject of serious discourse.<br />\\"Dragon\\"  was a definitely a page turner, and Lisbeth Salander was a fascinating character, and I'm glad to know she is the main character in another novel, but ultimately, this was an unsatisfying read.  Once certain talents of Salander are revealed, much of the story (but certainly not all of it) is predictable.<br />There was one scene that I don't want to give away, that was spectacular, involving Lisbeth, and her perverse guardian.  She has the kind of energy you'd love to see unleashed on all the perverts of the world.
B000WMEAKC|5.0|I bought this CD over a year ago and still listen to it almost every day!  Every song is so different but still connected.  The lead singer is just amazing the way he captures your attention and makes you feel the music.  Great buy.
0141439513|4.0|This was a good book. I loved the movie and liked the book more because I got to know more about the story throuogh the book. The only problem that I had was the style of the writing. It was a little hard to read and understand, but they did have a glossery in the back of the book that told you what everything ment that you don't understand.
031606792X|5.0|Hands down my favorite book in the saga.  There is not a dull moment in this installment and I wouldn't expect there to be with Stephanie Meyer as the author.  What a timeless story concluded with compassion, honesty, heart, and closure.  Gives me chills just thinking about it.
0380715430|4.0|Interesting information that has to have been a monumental task for the author.  Not an easy read, but very interesting for writers, teachers, and others that are intrigued by the English language and its development and changes both over time and from place to place.

B002KQ6BT6|2.0|While having fully enjoyed Mr. Brown's two previous Robert Langdon novels I have to admit to being very disappointed by The Lost Symbol. The puzzle solving and game playing of the earlier books was almost nonexistent in this one. I almost couldn't wait for it to end so that I good get to work reading something else that would be more enjoyable.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|The book seems to be all over the spectrum.  It jumps around and I have yet to make a connection with any character.  I found myself staring off into space on more than one occasion while trying to wade through this book.  Not his best writing for sure.  On the other hand, I have surely read worse.

B001AQTWF2|4.0|I recall how much I loved the first Whitney Houston lp. Gosh, it was 1985 and the voice and songs was prue Magic. Well, fast foward 24 years and \\"I look to you\\" is not that first lp, but it's also NOT 1985 anymore either so once we come to terms with that you can review this project in a fair way.    I really enjoyed two tracks \\"Million Dollar Bill\\" and \\"Call You Tonight\\" both are great songs and while other tracks \\"I turn to you\\" and \\"I didn't know my own Stregnth\\" are enjoyable they call to mind the problems Miss Houston has been dealing with, the first two tracks are just Strong pop/R&B songs sung by a classic voice.    All in all I enjoyed this cd and while it's not one to add to the \\"Bucket list\\" I think if you ever liked whitney before you would find something here to enjoy.
0385504225|1.0|I have read all of Dan brown's Books. But i can say that this is the most boring book I have read.    It's all about descriptions of rituals,tombs, buildings ,paintings and symbols ...more like a history book.    No plot, Very evident twists and boring narration.Infact all thru the book i was flipping pages to reach the actual paragraph..!!   I felt like a fool after reading the ending..    Its waste of money and most of all waste of your precious time to go through the mountain sized book.

0439023491|3.0|I'll review this book with three words: Hunger Games Two.  Really.  It's the same book as the first, and the ending is what I figured the beginning of Catching Fire would be.  Who didn't see the revolution coming in Hunger Games?  Did I need another arena full of killing to justify it?  Geez.  I'm so sick of authors finding a formula and milking the reader for all it's worth.  This book was totally unnecessary.

0385504225|3.0|There are lots of good reviews already, I hope to add a little perspective for those of you that read heavily in this genre.    1) If you read him before and thought highly of Da Vinci Code, this is likely a disappointment.    2) If you read Da Vinci 1st, you probably decided you want to read more Dan Brown. If you read Lost Symbol 1st, you may be thinking about trade-ins at the used book store, not where to find shelf space.    P.S.  the last word, sentence, of the book ...... gag me!
B0021L8US0|5.0|i agree with one of the previous reviewers about this movie copying much of the features of previous alien movies. What really stands out is the storyline and how a man is transformed completely to a different person by the end of the movie.  The movie is shot like a documentary and the main character's acting is superb.
B0021L8UVC|3.0|If you combined the sci-fi/horror element of being trapped on a ghostly ship like in Event Horizon, fight scenes straight out of Pitch Black and creatures that look very similar to the ones in The Descent (other than the fact that they carry weapons here), you would get Pandorum as a result. I liked all three of those movies I mentioned, so it's not exactly a bad thing. The acting ranges from average to fairly good, the ships's atmosphere is creepy, there are a few neat twists along the way and I liked the ending, yet I left the theater feeling entertained, but I wasn't entirely satisifed. I'm not quite sure why, but something about the movie was just off at times. For starters, there were far fewer action scenes than I expected after watching all the trailers. It's not that I need wall to wall fight scenes, but this movie could have used a some more. Also, the quick cut editing got on my nerves, especially when people are fighting to the death and you have no idea who's winning. The mystery of what really happened to the 60,000 people aboard the ship was handled well, as we get piece after piece of the puzzle. Overall, Pandorum was exactly the kind of film I predicted it to be and I had fun watching it, but it had the potential to be so much more.
B00005OWIU|5.0|Having seen all Harry Potter movies thru the Half Blood Prince, I decided it was time to read the books.  Several had been given to me as gifts and others I purchased new recently from Amazon.  I loved several of the movie music themes, especially the well-recognized Hedwig's Theme.  The original motion picture soundtrack CD is wonderful mood music to play in the background while reading Harry Potter books.  I've read Books one thru seven and Beedle the Bard in a little over a month's time.  Kept me out of trouble - and I'm a \\"Senior Citizen.\\" The music is beautiful but, then, anything John Williams does usually is, e.g. Star Wars, etc.
B000ZLFALI|1.0|This movie is almost not even worth reviewing! This abomination of a film has ruined all that I love of the Beatles. The whole thing sounds and looks like a bunch of high school drama drop-outs on valium singing and acting to standardized situatioins and backdrops of every 60's anti-protest, anti-Vietnam image/visual stereotype you can possibly imagine! The only parts bareable within were Bono's and Eddie Izzard's cameos...but you know why they were good?...because they are talented! On top of all that, they respect what the Beatles represent and still do to this day! I'm sorry for all the Beatles' fans out there that loved this movie, but it really just made me feel ashamed and embarrassed. This movie was made already with a better message and a better crew a few years back, and without disgracing itself with the Beatles as propoganda (\\"Forest Gump\\" ring a bell anyone?) This movie is a mockery of everything good in the Beatles, the generation, and good taste in film-making!

0307474275|2.0|I'm almost ashamed to admit I read this book, as it was such a moronic piece of fiction. My excuse for starting it is that it was a hot topic at the time I read it (2004); my excuse for finishing it (and this is the shameful part, and the only reason I gave it 2 stars) is that it was a decent thriller, in a mindless sort of way--the literary equivalent of Die Hard 2, 3, 4, ... But the book was filled with such ridiculous and inexcusable errors of fact that it took the edge off whatever pulp pleasure I might have otherwise derived from it--and convinced me never to read another Dan Brown book, however desperate for escapist fiction I might become.
B001FB4W0W|2.0|Anna Paquin looks gorgeous, a society where vampires are a minority instead of monsters is interesting and this show has the best credit sequence I've seen in some time. There. I've said just about all the good things that deserve to be said about True Blood. This series chronicles the unnecessarily turbulent romance between a needlessly angsty vampire and the moody psychic waitress who loves him. Some of the supporting cast, like her horndog ignoramous brother and the restaurant's sassy, gay African American cook are fun to watch. Others like her sassy, straight African American best friend are not. True Blood has some good ideas at its core but I feel like this show would have done better in the hands of someone who appreciated the horror genre and vampires, instead of trying to sweep the monstrosity under the rug. H.P Lovecraft complained that Edgar Rice Burroughs' aliens were just green skinned humans with funny names. This same thing is happening to vampires. I don't think it lives up to the hype.
B001BJ6918|4.0|While not as action packed as Volume One, in Volume Two you learn more about The Bride and her past relationship with Bill.  Apparently, unknown to the Bride, Bill, expertly acted by the late David Carradine, of \\"Kung Fu\\" fame, has been raising their daughter, BeBe, and doing a really good job of it, too.  We also learn that the love between Uma's character and Bill was really strong before it all fell apart.  As incredible as it may seem, Uma was completely mesmerized by him at one time.     Of course, the Bride has been doing a good job of eliminating, through death or total incapacitation, the killers on her list.  Her fight with Elle, memorably played by Daryl Hannah, the film's one-eyed wonder, is as much fun as it is a bit disgusting.  One must put aside disbelief in Uma's literally \\"death defying\\" scenes with Budd, Bill's brother.  The bride's scenes with her aged, but sadistic, Japanese instructor, are also very funny.  Who would have guessed that Uma's character was multilingual!    Those fans of Quentin Tarantino hoping for a happy ending will not be disappointed. I certainly wasn't.
B000JSI7AI|5.0|I have loved this movie since it first came out--acting, scenery, plot.  One thing has bugged me though.  For a good production, they let it go out with what I consider a major mispronounciation in the ending song.  Maybe only a westerner would know, but the word in \\"get along little dogie\\" is pronounced with a long o--it means stray calf.  The singer says doggie, which is wrong.
0307266303|5.0|Saw an article about this book in Men's Health magazine and was intrigued to hear about the Tarahumara tribe in Mexico.  Crazy to me that these people actually exist.  The same goes for these ultramarathoners and their lifestyle.  Personally I can't run worth a lick because of a bad hip (I'm 40) but after reading this book I felt like I should be able to......I call that inspiration.  I guess the ultimate compliment to this book is that I felt compelled to recommend it on amazon.com and have started to eat chia seeds as well.  I'd also recommend the Nike Frees that are brought up in the book.....THE most comfortable shoes I've ever owned.

0895260131|5.0|Having actually been to four islamic countries, I will say that it would be simplistic to assume that all muslims perceive the world through a uniform ideology. In fact, having recently worked in a position that required close interaction with a variety of Iraqi cultures, I will say that many muslims are quite pleasant and genial individuals. They were quite willing to assist others in learning Arabic, and were worthy adversaries at Chess. Did I trust them? That is ANOTHER story entirely...    Yes, individually, there are many nice people who follow islamic cultural practices, (with varying degrees of dedication) who are no threat to anyone.     However, in the BIG global picture, there is quite a different story entirely.    A proninent Israeli politicain summarized it approximately:  \\"Not all Muslims are terrorists. But most terrorists are Muslims.\\"    This illustrates a HARSH TRUTH, that a vast number of touchy-feelly-sensitive oh-so- politically-correct and \\"tolerant\\" liberals REFUSE to acknowledge. Like most of the flowery idealisms of the leftist mind-set, you can wish for your belief that \\"Islam is a religion of peace\\", in one hand, ...and defecate in the other. Which hand will fill up faster?     In the end, you will just be another \\"tolerant\\" PC liberal, with your sensitive little pony-tail and multicultural tie-dyed shirt, ...standing about forlornly with feces in your hand.    In this oustanding addition to the PIG series, Mr. Spencer gives us a truly valid summary of the VERY REAL issues regarding islam in our time, and in history.    Among the topics covered within:  -You will learn about the TRUE character of Mohammed ( I have a hard time convincing myself that a caravan-raiding bandit has legitimacy as a \\"prophet\\". ...among other things.)    -The Quran preaches warfare against NON-muslims, and this is taken very literally by a significant number of practitioners of the \\"religion of peace\\".     -Women are treated like GARBAGE, SLAVES, and LIVESTOCK, inMANY islamic communities. Once again, this varies depending upon the specific cultural group, but in the BIG picture, islamic women have a very bad situation indeed.    -For all the \\"tolerance\\" that is DEMANDED within Western culture, regarding the growing islamic presence, there is NO RECIPROCATION from the islamic minority. It seems that a number of people who have dared to criticize islam, intentionally or not, have been THREATENED, ASSAULTED, or MURDERED. Have we forgotten WHY Salman Rushdie has been living in hiding under British government protection? Have we forgotten what happened to Mr. Van Gogh in the Netherlands? Have we fogotten about the Danish Jyllends Posten magazine incident, ...and the retalitory burning of a NORWEGIAN embassy in response?  ...so much for \\"Freedom of Expression\\"    -Read about how the Bible and the Quran compare in their respective messages. Critics of the Bible site atrocities that some Christians commited CENTURIES AGO, ...but IGNORE not only atrocities that muslims commited in past centuries, but those crimes commited RECENTLY, IN OUR TIME.    -The Crusades were a rather minor and brief COUNTER-ATTACK, compared to over a milennium of islamic invasion, conquest, and raids upon the Christian lands of Europe, Asia, and Africa. Let us not forget that islamic forces DID IN FACT OCCUPY VAST REGIONS OF EUROPE, namely the Iberian Penninsula and the Balkans, for HUNDREDS of YEARS.    -Yes, there was a time when the Islamic kingdoms possessed a number of emminent universities and considerable academic institutions. Yes, many European Christians did benefit from attendance. What happened to this \\"golden age\\"? I think an in-depth comparison of Western history and its ENORMOUS ACHIEVEMENTS since at least 1500 A.D., ...will have more to say than what transpired in the islamic realms.    -The Islamic perception of \\"Heaven\\": a wild eternal party of feasting, boozing, and gratuitous sexual indulgence. Every man will have a horde of wives who will automatically be virgins every day! Now, can you imagine how the hysterically leftos would criticize Christians, if Christians held such a belief to be a LITERAL TRUTH?    -As a FREE Westerner, would you REALLY want to live under Sharia Law?   Now, I have observed profoundly LIBERAL FEMINISTS, ...RIGHT HERE, in Minnesota, ...convert to islam, ...burkas, head-scarves and all. Absolutely inexplicable. I don't need to expound upon the OVERT CONTRADICTIONS.    -On the tiresome, emotional, and repetitive insistance by Westerners that \\"We are not at war with islam\\", here is a revelation: Most muslims DO IN FACT BELIEVE a \\"state of war\\" DOES exist. Face the facts.    Now, I don't DEMAND that Muslims convert Christianity. I really don't care what religion anyone practices. You enjoy a better standard of living in the West that you HATE so much. It is because of the West, that you have wealth. The West, and other non-islamic nations, buy vast quantities of your petroleum. Go ahead and HATE your best customer. Oil is a FINITE resource.    An important revelation for all jihadis: What political successes you perceive for your cause, is only due to the fact that Western governments are currently staffed by weaklings, but this will change in time. There are still plenty of Crusaders left in the West. The U.S. Marine Corps proved that in Fallujah. Some people will shriek about any opinion contrary to the \\"multicultural\\" and \\"politically-correct\\" format.  I WILL voice criticism if I please. Thats just the way it is in the West, especially in America. The First Ammendment of the U.S. Constitution places emphasis on that.    If you are a leftist, I don't care what your opinion is, but you can express that in our Western culture. There is something you need to know. When the Islamic world rants about the \\"decadence of the West\\", they are talking about you, the leftists, and your \\"alternative lifestyles\\". God help you, if you \\"tolerant\\" and \\"multicultural\\" leftos find yourself subjected to \\"sharia law\\". For all your tired old screams of \\"bigotry\\" and \\"racism\\" for anyone who contradicts your \\"multicultural\\" idealisms, go live in the Middle-east for a while, as a non-muslim. See how \\"multicultural\\" and \\"tolerant\\" your Muslim friends are in their homelands.     You aren't going to convince me to \\"change my mind\\", because I have seen, read, and heard things, ...and I have BEEN TO MORDOR. The EVIDENCE I have observed makes me greatly concerned.
B0013FSL3E|4.0|Full of beautifully-done scenes, Wall-E is fun to watch. The subtle things done with portraying the robots in this film made them sympathetic characters in their own right, especially when it came to Wall-E and EVE. The plot revolves around the last trash-compacting robot still operational on Earth following a mass exodus from the planet. It meets another robot, a highly-advanced machine left on Earth for a mysterious purpose.<br /><br />The voicework is good and I really enjoyed the film and the short included on the DVD.
B001LA3JWY|3.0|This strikes me as a strange little book and I have to admit I'm still not quite sure what to make of it. It has the feeling of a palimpsest - and, indeed, at the core is the 1946 article Hersey wrote for the New Yorker - that lost its justification in the process of being added to and updated. The last third of the book degenerates into a sort of \\"where are they now\\" that continues to follow (into the 1970s) the lives of the handful of A-bomb survivors upon whom Hersey originally focused. But the fact of the matter is that all of them went on to lead substantially normal (and not especially remarkable) lives and that none of them has anything very insightful to say about their experiences (which is only what one might naturally expect, though it does lead to curiosity about why Hersey chose to write about them). Once Hersey has described the bomb's immediate effects and the days just afterward, the drama of the book is essentially used up. The bits of political history that he includes (either before or after the bombing) are decidedly sketchy, and Hersey's social analysis of the position of the \\"explosion-affected persons\\" in Japan isn't particularly deep. Interesting considering the historical context of the original article that led to the expanded book, but it's a slight effort nonetheless. More than that, it has that unmistakable air of an \\"assigned book\\" for high-school or J-high summer reading lists--one that's supposed to carry an important lesson or moral but which is, at base, dull enough to neither offend anyone nor inspire much interest. It's a \\"read this, it will educate you\\" book that embodies all the attendant problems of the genre and has a fair amount of difficulty standing the test of time.
0780626966|5.0|I ordered this set of \\"Nightmare on Elmstreet\\" to share with my family.  I am a product of the 80's, and back then, these movies were the best way to get scared!  Watching them again brought back great memories and was still a fun way to get scared!
B002C6K7N0|5.0|After reading ALL the reviews(I hate to sound redundant)I can put in my 2 cents.First,comparing this to Mega-sell-out-ica's latest is like dining on Pate` de fois gras vs.Chopped Liver.Most\\"metal\\"music is a tasteless,talentless waste of time&Listening Torture;one of the few'Thrash(?)'bands I can endure hearing is this one-and I've got'em all.The only'slow'song(The Hardest Part Of Letting Go-Sealed W/a Kiss)is a Plaintive'metal'ballad,for some reason it brings up recollections of Edgar Allen Poe's\\"Tell-Tale Heart\\".Thanks for the memories-Endgame,How the Story Ends,& The Right to Go Insane are the standout tracks;the rest of it's pretty good too;the cover art is disheartening,but then I don't expect pictures of puppies&kittens for MEGADETH Art-be sure to catch their stage act,you are getting a real bargain for what they charge to see'em...
B001QOOCTE|5.0|Amazing how they seamlessly spliced the performances together.  While the CD actually has better sound, the DVD is stunning in the presentation of the performances.  And the whole thing benefits a great cause.

B0021L8UVC|4.0|The year is 2174. The population of Earth has reached over 24 billion. Famine and wars are commonplace. In a last ditch effort to save humankind, we send out a probe to find a planet that can sustain us. The mission is a success, though it will take over a hundred years to reach the new home...<br /><br />Fast forward:<br /><br />Two men wake up from deep sleep; alone, disoriented and suffering from memory loss. As their recollections slowly return, they realize they are part of the space ship crew navigating 60,000 settlers from Earth to the new planet. They have questions, but few answers. Where is everyone? How long have they been asleep? Why are they awake? Who's on bridge, flying the machine? And finally, once they discover they are NOT alone: what are those things, and where did they come from?!<br /><br />Butterflies in my stomach? Check. Nails (my own ;o)) digging into my arm? Check. Conversing with friends about the movie long after the end? Check. All are side effects of a well made scary thriller (the sci-fi was just a bonus) and all were present in this case. The story has a great twist, but, best of all, it is largely plot-hole-free, as well as plausible.<br /><br />So, why four, rather then five stars?  Two reasons. Firstly, once answers start coming, they come fast and furious, to the point of being a tad confusing. Secondly, the two main characters are a bit lacking. Until the climactic end, Dennis Quaid spends most of the film saying \\"Bower, are you there...are you there, Bower?\\" He is a good actor but the script does not give him much to work with, leaving his talent underused. Ben Foster (the Angel from X-Men the Last Stand), disserves the top billing, as the action revolves mainly around him. Still, a more charismatic actor may have drawn us further into the character. There is a nice appearance from Cung Le, a Vietnamese-American real life martial arts champion (you may remember him from Fighting). He is a talkative passanger with all the answers, but, to Bower's frustration, no English. The man can move, but his awesome skills are not fully utilized here either. Shame...<br /><br />This is not another Alien or Predator. It will not change the direction of film evolution. Still, Pandorum satisfactorily delivers scary, creepy sci-fi with a well put together story and a hopeful ending (I miss those!). It entertains!<br /><br />Enjoy!n, no English.

B000001ESF|3.0|The music is fine.  But I have only 1 question.  Why are the lyrics backwards?  Is the listener supposed to hold up the \\"liners\\" to a mirror while indulging in the awesomeness of Peart, Lee and Lifeson?  I don't get it?  Was this another \\"Japanese boo boo?\\"  Aiya!  Disappointed, yes!  Wanting to get the GOLD version, ALSO YES!  But will it matter?  I dunno.  The GOLD version is way more expensive, true!  (Yet ALSO \\"courtesy\\" of Japan.)  Has anyone else noticed this \\"issue,\\" or am I the only idiot that cares about reading lyrics and liner notes, NORMALLY and NOT IN REVERSE?  Pshaw!  Ugh!  Whoever remastered the music, UNmastered the lyrics.  MASTERFULLY so!  Yak!  The lyrics may as WELL be in Japanese.  And no offense to Japan either.  I guess the real question is, why are all the remasters NOT done in their studio of origin (e.g., Toronto; or wherever)?  Why do we constantly put pressure on the Japanese \\"to make things right,\\" when it's impossible for them to do just that.  I pity them.  As I pity all those such as myself who are are stuck with an insert that is VIRTUALLY ILLEGIBLE (without a mirror).  Seriously!  This is NOT professional, folks.  Not. Not. Not.  Unless we've all given up reading, and just twitter away our days from now until the end of our days.  Pray that's not the case. TEEWT! TEEWT! TEEWT!  What an embarrassment for Rush.  And a lot LESS of a rush, for the intelligent listener/reader, whom Rush unceasingly endeavors to indulge.

Take my word for it.     If you thought Harry Potter was totally lame and predictable, you will absolutely love these books as well. It's much better than Harry Potter. More beautifully written, more intense, better plot and more depth to the story.The main character is (for a decent part of the book) a teenager, and does go to a school where some magic is taught, but that's where the similarities end. These books seem to ride a line somewhere between Young adult and (regular adult?) regular fantasy. The character is young, and it's very much a coming of age story, at least as far as the first book is concerned. But, you'll understand from just the first few pages that this series will not end as a young adult story by any means.     For those of you who think, \\"I just don't like epic fantasy. All those dragons and wizards just don't work for me.\\" Well, how about the story of a boy whose parents die, and who is forced to live a life of fear and abuse on the streets. How about a person that has rumors spread about him that make him sound much cooler than he is? There's much more to this book than magic, and no dragons (well, there IS a large lizard addicted to drugs, but that's a review for another day).     The Name of the Wind is told from the first person. It's absolutely fantastic and I can't help but recommend it to anyone that wants something to read. I even teared up just a little as I read parts of this book, and yes, I'm tough enough to admit it. Great book, just great, especially for a first novel. 9/10.    Several people I've talked to lately have mentioned that they think this book seemed just a little too cliche for them. I think that the style Rothfuss has chosen to write this first book in was chosen on purpose. We've got a first person book here, and I think that he may be playing withthe concept of the unreliable narrator just a little bit. I believe the tone and feel of these books will change, especially in the final volume, as Kvothe, the main character, grows to adulthood.    Oh, and if you trust the people that publish books to recommend a good one, know this: The President of Daw books personally wrote to many people to give them advanced reader copies of this book, telling them it was the best book she'd read in decades.

0439023483|5.0|The Hunger Games is a novel by award winning author Suzanne Collins. This book was recommended to me by the dude at my local Waldenbooks store, and since he's practically my twin in terms of what we enjoy, I assumed this would no doubt be another excellent recommendation.     I know that it seems a bit fanboy, but I can honestly say that I was blown away by this book. I was in no way prepared for the story inside. Well, maybe a little prepared. The guy at the Waldenbooks did tell me that it was like Thunderdome for kids. I guess that should have tipped me off.     Katniss lives in District 12, a coal mining district in what was once known as the Appalachian Mountains. Each year, one boy and one girl from each district compete in the Hunger Games, a fight to the death that the Capitol uses to show its dominance over the Districts. Only one person can emerge victorious, and that person is then set for life. Katniss always worries about being chosen, about what will happen to her family if she is. District 12 doesn't have a reputation for winning the games, and Katniss, though just 16, is the main bread winner for her family. Things take a turn for the worst, however, when Katniss' twelve year old sister is given the \\"privilege\\" of competing.     Collins weaves an incredible post-apocalyptic young adult tale that had me spellbound from the first few pages. The vocabulary is at an appropriate level for younger readers, and yet the story doesn't feel like it's being watered down in any way. This makes for a quick and suspenseful read. Collins chose to use the first person present tense to tell the story, which I thought was quite interesting. At first, this bothered me, but eventually I think it led me deeper into the story, closer to Katniss' tale.     Katniss is fantastic as a narrator. Humble to a fault, and unable to trust others, her logic and thought process is interesting and slightly disturbing for a person her age.     I've never read another story by Collins, but if they're anything like this one I'll have to get the whole library. I highly recommend this book. It was my favorite book of 2008, and as soon as my local library gets a copy of the recently released sequel, Catching Fire you can bet I'll be all over it.     Final Score: 9.5/10 An quick read with an overarching story line that will easily span the three volumes of the planned trilogy, but with the kind of satisfying ending that rarely accompanies the first volume of a trilogy.   (less)
B002GJT4XW|5.0|Loaded with extras, including new documentaries and an extended cut of the film, these Ultimate Editions have everything a fan could want (aside from a commentary although the In-Movie Experience should be close.) Films 1 and 2 will be getting this special treatment with the remaining six films to follow (book 7 is going to be two films.) A must for any fan of the Harry Potter series!
0385504225|3.0|well... they are and they aren't.    First, a few minor points that should be obvious.    -The DVC and A+D are two really tough acts to follow, I am not surprised DB is incapable of hitting a home run each time... and who is?    -I see a lot about the book being just like the others he's written in the past (if you've one read Dan Brown novel you've read them all), which in large part, it is.. but be fair here, it didn't stop John Grisham or J.K. Rowling from writing the same novel 7 different times... I have been silently praying for those 2 to stop writing books for years.     The good:    -Give Brown credit, he obviously put some effort and homework into researching the topics, which I hope is something you really appreciate like I do, or you shouldn't be wasting your time with his works.    -It definitely had some of those page-turner qualities of his old books that made you incapable of putting it down or racing home from work to read it.    -Personally, though he is being accused of not being the greatest writer over it, I like the fact that his books make for fairly light reading. I don't think he's an awful writer like many people seem to, I rather enjoy his literary style for the most part.      The bad:    -Like all of his books, it's simply too long. He is given to repetitive rants, particularly when in the mind of his villains, way past the point of absorption by reader.     -He thoroughly ABUSED his cliff hanger chapter endings. It got really old and started to feel gimmicky and like the book was simply skipping around too much.    -The same \\"sub plots\\" are played over and over again. The one that keeps coming to mind now is how many times they couldn't solve a puzzle, and then all of the sudden it was simple, how could have they not have seen it before?? Lame.     -It's hard for any book to recover from a bad ending, and this book had not one, but two bad endings. The first bad ending was that the secret they were trying to protect throughout the bookjust wasn't all that exciting or all that worthy of protection. I suspect that this was the most disappointing part for most readers.    The second bad ending was the 50 plus pages near the end of the book, that I stopped caring about long after the meat of the book came to it's conclusion. It was just drivel and pseudo-spiritual nonsense. His editor really needs to reign him in on spiritual rantings he so loves, because it made the ending to this book one of the most insufferable I have ever read.     In the end, I have to admit, I found the majority of the book to be fairly entertaining despite the fact that it did have a bad ending and wasn't that original. I really got the feeling that Dan Brown was already imagining the movie (that will no doubt follow) in his head, and unfortunately, it read and felt a bit like a cheesy, cliche Hollywood movie.     I think that we probably need to accept that the little love affair with Dan Brown has run it's course. Much like the musician who has only good album or the athlete who has only one or two good seasons, I fear that Dan has played his hand well, had his day in the sun and his best stories are now behind us. He managed to make himself into a household name, but by the time he finishes his next novel (especially if he takes 6 years), he may well find himself irrelevant.
0385504225|1.0|Last paragraph contains a spolier ....     I bought this in high anticipation and was extremely disappointed .. short review is that the writing of Dan Brown is repetitive and rambling, I found myself forwarding thru pages at a time bored by the book.  It seems like the book was a report that required a certain number of words or pages and Dan wrote to fill the order.  The entire plot could have been summarized in about one hundred page short story.      Dan tries to fill the book with linguistic trickery and cheap tricks.    The plot is not plausible in the least, I was three steps ahead of the author in figuring out the plot.  Every character speaks in riddles and holds a part of the key to solving the mysteries of the lost symbol, it gets very tiring getting lead on by each and every character when in the normal universe people are much more straight forward.  Even when they characters are being hunted down they speak to each other in riddles, they have no time in the plot for long winded conversations but .....    Most importantly, I found it incredible that the son of Peter Solomon was murdered and his wealth stolen and no investigation was ever performed to find out who stole his money.  I mean, get real ... Peter Solomon is one of the wealthiest men in the world and he couldn't find out who stole his sons money and identification after he was murdered?  Get real!  This one aspect absolutely ruined the book for me.    Dan Brown, you can do better ... keep writing like this and you will be a one hit wonder.
B00003CX5P|1.0|This could have been one of the better Star Wars movies. It certainly had excellent special effects and a superb duel between two Jedi and the Sith. However, it was marred by two characters. Jar Jar Binks turned out to be one of the most annoying characters ever conceived, whose every utterance was like hearing fingernails raked across a blackboard (one prominent critic wrote in anticipation of the next Star Wars movie, \\"Jar Jar Binks must die!\\" Unfortunately, he did not). The other was the child Anakin. I think, however, that this was primarily due to the dialogue given him; there were many instances where he just should have been silent and Lucas had him talking his head off with inane comments, but in truth his inflection left a lot to be desired during the exciting parts).
B00288KNJU|4.0|I liked this film. Didn't love it. It's similar to films like \\"Nightmare Before Christmas\\" or \\"Corpse Bride\\", but not as quirky. However, it's a solid, entertaining film with beautiful visuals. However, the 3D is very weak. This film has brilliant colors and the 3D glasses reduce the film to almost B/W because of the red/green filters that are used unlike the polarizing lenses in movie theaters. Also, they can give you a bit of a headache.<br /><br />Watch this film in 2D at home. Save the 3D for your local IMAX theater.
0312330537|3.0|Shantaram is like a big shaggy messy slobbery wet mangy biting dog that stole your heart.  An elegant work of fiction it's not, but it's got a BIG heart, and the sincerity of the author shines through, and you stick by him, not wanting to abandon him by not finishing the book.  Love it or hate it, the book stands on its own and there's not another book like it.  So snuggle up with this big ugly lovable mess of a book.

0385504225|1.0|I don't think many expect a literary classic when cracking open a Dan Brown novel. What I think is fair to expect is a thrilling story with a fantastic ending. I've read all of Dan Brown's books with Deception Point being my favorite, actually...and The Lost Symbol is the worst of them all.<br /><br />There are so many places I could start...the predictable characters, the plot twists you see coming, the irrationality of his characters...but the ending was just, just terrible. I continued to read because I continued to hold out hope that Brown was going to FINALLY unleash his big surprise, the reason that he took me through almost 600 pages of mediocre plot to get to that big \\"oh my God\\" moment like in his previous novels. It never came.<br /><br />I can't understand what Brown was doing in the years between the DVC and now. Through his meticulous research did he forget that the story was supposed to have a point? Also, why in the world is Robert Langdon suddenly and so frustratingly stupid? I would think, that after his heavily referenced \\"adventures\\" in DVC and A&D that he would be more open to things like the Ancient Mysteries.<br /><br />I can't fully convey my disappointment with this book. It was utterly a waste of my life. The plot started mediocre at best, but then crashed and burned at the end. Save yourself the time and leave this one on the shelf.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|One word: \\"Awesome\\" discribes this DVD set.  I only have a 32-inch, 720p Sony Bravia TV and a Sony DVD player with a 1080p upconverter.  I can only imagine what this series would look like on a Blu-ray DVD player and a much larger 1080i TV.  Having stated this, however, the video quality of this DVD set is just fabulous!  The details of the images of nature documented are stunning.  (So I suppose that \\"awesome\\" isn't the only adjective one could use!)  This documentary took five years and 40 cameramen to produce.  It was shot on 200 locations, from the highest mountaintops, to the deepest oceans, and everywhere in between.  It documents creatures and places the likes of which few, if any, have seen before.  This documentary is Evolutionary-based.  However, if one doesn't believe in this theory, as is the case with myself, just take some of what you hear with a grain of salt, sit back, and just enjoy the scenery! It's worth having to hear the Evolutionary ideas, if only to see the stunning visuals!  And the Theory of Evolution is by no means \\"pushed\\" in this documentary. It comes in a neat box, where every DVD has its own case. I will probably be buying \\"Blue Planet: Seas of Life\\" shortly, after having watched this set.  Amazon.com continues to do a great job as well!

0307588335|1.0|The authors should be sued for misrepresentation.    The first warning sign that this was going to be an opportunistic book -- the first book out in the 'race to the bottom' in painting a lurid view of Lehman -- is that the 'insider' of the two authors was only a vice-president. For those who do not know the large Wall Street firms, this is what you become if you can spell and have been hanging around the firm for five years. He would have known less about the actual machinations than the mail clerk. To call him an insider is only correct in that he had a pass card that allowed him to get into the building.    But I read it anyway.  The first few chapters are of no value, unless you care about the background of a guy who was one of thousands of worker bees. After that, the only value of the book comes from having another co-author who can spin silk out of corn husks.

0393307050|5.0|I tried to read this a couple of times, at the urging of my parents.  I had a hard time getting into it.  Finally when finding myself on a long, solo, road trip, I bought the CDs and fell in love.  I worked my way through the entire series on both audio and paper books.  Many times, I didn't want to wait til I was back in the car, and would continue on with the book in the house.  I do like a good series, because once I become attached to characters, I hate to say goodbye.  I think that the audio version is good, especially because one gets the pronunciations correctly, and somehow, some of the technical sea stuff seems a bit easier to understand.  I haven't seen the film, so I don't know about that.  Generally, I am disappointed in the film version.
B002I9Z89Y|1.0|Maybe I'd had given this release five enthusiastic stars -- if I could see them. These discs will not play on older Panosonic Blu-ray players and Blu-ray recorders. On mine it loads Paramount's promo, touting all their wonderful Blu-ray releases, but when you hit \\"Play Episode\\" the menu options vanish and nothing else happens.     I installed the latest firmware, but still nothing. You'd think with the hundreds of millions Paramount makes off \\"Star Trek\\" they might have paid some office clerk $10/hour to check the discs against all name-brand machines, but I guess they didn't want to be bothered. Whatever happened to Quality Control?     When I first got into, ahem, HD DVD, I was quite excited and impressed by Star Trek: The Original Series--Season 1. It looked and sounded fantastic, and the extra features were terrific. I was really looking forward to season 2 on HD DVD.      Three weeks later, HD DVD effectively dropped dead.      I eventually bought a Blu-ray player and waited. And waited. And waited. Finally, almost two years later, Season 2 is out and so am I -- out of luck, that is. So much for pre-ordering. So much for expedited shipping. Money down the drain.      So now what? Wait two months for enough angry customers
0385504225|5.0|Great book, as i saw someone mentioned earlier it makes me want to go back to DC and while reading , had Google right there with me looking up information, looking at pictures that the book referred too.

1932100660|5.0|T. Colin Campbell's career-long study of nutrition has produced a simple assertion backed up by empirical evidence: that a diet featuring animal protein and fat is harmful to human health - the best action you can take in order to have long-term health is to eat a plant-based diet. But don't think this statement capture the full import of the book. \\"The China Study\\" is well worth reading from cover to cover. Along the way, Campbell has many insightful thing to say about human nutrition, the nature of scientific investigation, and the depredations caused by scientific reductionism.    Towards the end, he asks the following disturbing questions:    \\"How did we get to a place where the healers of our society, our doctors, know little, if anyting, about nutrition; where our medical institutions denigrate the subject; where using prescription drugs and going to hospitals is the third leading cause of death? How did we get to place where advocating a plant-based diet can jeopardize a professional career, where scientists spend more time mastering nature than respecting it? How did we get to a place where the companies that profit from out sickness are the ones telling us how to be healthy; where the companies that profit from our food choices are the ones telling us what to eat; where the public's hard-earned money is being spent by the government to boost the drug industry's profits; and where there is more distrust than trust of our governments policies on foods, drugs and health?\\"    Dr. Campbell is not simply a writer or journalist, he is a distinguished professor of Nutritional Biochemistry at Cornell University. This is a very important book for everyone to read, and it could have a major impact on your life.

B000001EUP|5.0|This is my favorite 80s metal Scorpions album. Starting with 1979s Lovedrive, 2 albums before this, they changed their sound into what we find here and what they are remembered for most. Although not their best-selling album, I believe that honor goes to 1990s Crazy World, this is their hardest-rocking, most consistent 80s album.     It was created under a lot of pressure, with the drummer suffering from complications from alcoholism and the singer Klaus Meine was just recovering from vocal chord surgery. In spite of these problems they delivered a 10 of a metal album. All the songs are highlights and at least the first 3 tracks are concert staples as well as hit singles. Scorpions fans or fans of 80s metal can't go wrong with this one.     Highly Recommended
0061148512|5.0|The Bell Jar is the loosely autobiographical novel by Sylvia Plath. It's one of my favorite books. I could read it repeatedly, and that's not something I normally do with most novels. Unquestionably, Sylvia Plath was one of the greatest literary talents of the 20th century. Just from reading this novel, you can tell she is a poet at heart. The book is simpler and more straightforward than her poetry (which is to be expected), but she draws you in as the reader with her various uses of simile and her striking imagery. The prose has an intensity, as well has a conversational tone, that makes it feels as if Esther Greenwood is speaking directly to you, making it hard to put down.     Despite its reputation in some circles as a \\"feminist\\" novel, young men and women should be able to read this book and find something to relate to. Not only does Esther struggle with society's sexist double standards, she is also striving to find her place in the world, establish a career, carve out an identity for herself. This is a must read for anyone in their young adulthood because who doesn't deal with those existential dilemmas during that time? This book is also well known for focusing on depression. Plath makes you understand the illness completely through Esther's eyes, to the point that that it's difficult to determine what is actually wrong with her. The subject matter may keep some people away but Plath's hilariously sardonic sense of humor provides great comic relief throughout the entire novel (even throughout the heavier second half). Plath's reputation often precedes her work so I would recommend not going into the novel with any preconceived notions and simply treasuring its brilliance.
B000001EUR|5.0|This came after their breakthrough album Blackout and enjoyed even more success than that classic. The scorpions had a penchant for making catchy, radio-friendly metal a la Def Leppard, but their sound was a little edgier and I like them better. This album has 5 songs that became hits or concert classics including Rock You Like A Hurricane which is probably their all-time best-known song. From the first notes of Bad Boys Running Wild you know that it's going to be a fun listen. For those of us that went to high school at the time it will bring back memories as we probably owned this album back then also. Great record for new and old fans alike.     Don't expect the sound of early Scorpions here though. That was an almost different band altogether. This sound is more streamlined and less psychedelic.     Highly Recommended.
B00008S2VG|5.0|American Life could have been the second part of Music, her previous album. Again she plays the acoustic guitar and again she works with Mirwais. The title track is awesome, but it does include some Madonna rapping we never heard before. The lyrics are good, but you have to listen and think well. They are cryptic, if you know what they mean you will understand the message of this song (and other songs on the album). Hollywood is about how you can make it there, simple lyrics and repeatable melodies, but very catchy! I'm So Stupid is about how stupid Madonna is, she believed all the famous people were perfect. Love Profusion is one of the very rare positive songs on this album. It's about love, and is one of the best of the album. Intervention looks a bit like Love Profusion, but Love Profusion is better, because Intervention is very simple: it's played with the guitar and some beats and that's it. Love Profusion has some more sounds. Nothing Fails is a guitar ballad, it sounds like I Deserve It. Die Another Day doesn't fit in this album, just like American Pie didn't on Music.It has lots of crazy sounds, really Madonna.
B0011DK5AU|3.0|Led Zeppelin III was created after II received very poor critical reviews and they were accused of not being able to write lighter material. LZ was never loved by critics back in the day, and not wanting to dodge the criticism they produced the more folksie, acoustic LZ III. It still has its share of rockers and most of the softer songs are also great after repeated listens, but that was always my balk about this album. It has to grow on you and even then, it doesn't compare to other albums in their repertoire well. Highlights include:<br /><br />Immigrant Song<br />Friends<br />Celebration Day<br />Since I've Been Loving You<br />Tangerine<br /><br />The casual fan won't find a lot to love here. It's better to start with their best-seller (untitled) aka Led Zeppelin IV or Zoso<br />(Led Zeppelin refused to put any kind of identifier on their next album's sleeve to refute the claim by critics that their albums sold because of the band's name and not the songs)
B00004X01U|5.0|This is Madonna at her best this cd is so great and reminds me of the 80's Madonna where albums seemed so effortless to her (I mean that in a good way). Every real fan should have this cd its 55 minutes of great music!!

Skip 3,4,5, & 6 this is the 3rd and final!!
B002IKLMN4|4.0|No one else before has shown me about the Dip. In the past, I quit several business when I was on the Dip, thinking that it was the best choice. Now I realize that in some cases I could have continued through the Dip and succeed in my proposal.  It also highlights the importance of your commitment with the market, and how influencing one person is much more harder than influencing a hive.  Great and easy book, which now lives on my idea and performance.
B00288KNLS|5.0|If your a fan of stop-motion animation, then this movie is for you. What stood out to me during the whole movie was the quality and smoothness of the facial expressions, especially on Coraline herself. If I didn't know any better, I would have thought that they were CG effects added afterwards. A word of caution though, to those of you who suffer, as I do, from red/green color blindness. Chances are you won't get the full, or any, effect of the 3D process. I have yet to find a 3D effect based on color separation that I can actually fully experience. The good part though is the fact that the 2 disc special edition comes with both the 2D and 3D versions. This way everyone can enjoy it at their own pleasure. So if you're a fan of The Nightmare Before Christmas or The Corpse Bride, and the like, I would get this movie.
B00004VVND|4.0|'Westworl' probabily it is the Michael Crichton's most entertaining movie in the one that combine two genres, the science-fiction and the western, with a great sense of the narrative balance. The topic of the machines' -robots'-revolt, against your creators appears for the first time here. 'Westworld' used as inspiration to the saga of 'Terminator'. Also it used as inspiration the own Crichton to write his novel 'Jurassic Park' using the topic of the funfairs that are constructed apart from the common sense and that damage the basic principles of safety. Yul Brynner appears as a robotic caricature of your Chri's role in 'The Magnificent Seven', contribuiting humor and uneasiness in the members of the audience.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Its true Madonna never fails. I am never disappointed after I listen to a Madonna album. I just finished listening to this one and all I can say is WOW!! Shes 50 years old and still has her voice. And the songs are jumping. The song Give it to me got me dancing. The song after it reminded me of her stuff from the 80s. A mix of Pop, Electronica and Hip hop on this one. Madonna is truly the Queen of Pop.
B00000IQCA|3.0|One common complaint of this film is that it has no focus and we wind up with something that is blurry even if it is trying to take a snapshot of something.  It is like a collage of plots, stories, and fashion into one big piece of artwork.  This is not to say that it can't be entertaining of course.  People's tastes do differ.  Not everybody likes modern art.  Some people like something more traditional.  I guess the highlight of the film would be the end sequence where you get to see the bevy of models that, like the story, has no clothes.  And if you like looking at big bellies of a pregnant woman than this may be a film for you.  It is what is on the inside that counts after all, not the superficial outside.
0385504225|1.0|When the dust jacket is the most artfully crafted element, there's a problem. True, creating a good work of fiction is NOT easy, but this novel really stinks. That said, I'm not going to blame Dan Brown exclusively. There was a cabal of co-conspirators responsible for this hot mess.    1. Heidi Lange (Dan's agent) - Ms. Lange, after the success of DVC, selling this had to be the biggest no-brainer of your career, even if the final product took SIX YEARS to materialize. But since The Lost Symbol is now likely to send Dan plummeting to the mid-list region (who'd of thought that was possible), I suggest you simply take the money and run. Oh wait, you can't ... you'll want to stick around and be sure Ron Howard and Akiva Goldsman don't opt out. (They'll have their hands full making this film turn a profit.)    2. Jason Kaufman (Dan's editor) - Jason, did you even read this thing? There are entire chapters that could have been nuked, superfluous POVs, repetition on top of repetition, mindless banter, annoying forays into minutiae (for example, the origin of neckties), interior monologues or statements that DO NOT adequately serve to break up extraneous exposition, a reveal that's more anticlimactic than any in the history of literature, and a protag whose role becomes as neutered as the villain. Maybe Chapter 44 is eerily accurate and like Jason Kaufman, uh, I mean, Faukman, you didn't receive pages in enough time to properly review them. It could definitely take more than a few YEARS to have fixed this manuscript. (I'd have thrown my hands in the air!)    3. Blythe Brown (Dan's wife) - This interesting woman does a lot of research for the hubby. And, girlfriend, I'm right with you on adding esoteric and arcane tidbits to spice up the story. (With degrees in linguistics, archaeology, and philosophy, that stuff is soooo up my street!) However, using every iota you uncovered bogs down the pace and results in serious nausea. Listen to Dan -- the book should be a roller coaster ride, not those freakin' teacups at Disney.     4. Dan Brown (our intrepid tour guide, but no George Bernard Shaw) - Let's face it, Dan, there was little to no chance this tale would outshine DVC, but kudos for tryin'. Go on vacation, lick your wounds, regroup, spend time in an isolation tank, or hang like a bat, but don't pack it in yet. You still have fans and we know you're capable of better tales than this. (For those of you who don't know why I'm citing Shaw, decode the back cover of the book.)     So there it is -- Dan was trying to please too many people with Symbol. Heidi's claims of easy money lured him and, even though he knew he couldn't top the sales of DVC, he felt obligated to his agent. Then there was Dan's special sense of obligation to his wife (whose ideas for DVC helped catapult his work into the stratosphere), but his misguided amour resulted in a hapless plot built to include (what seemed to be) EVERY ONE of Blythe's precious factoids. Which leads us to Jason, who should have had the brass ones necessary to whip out a blue pencil and save Dan from himself. But as we all know, Jason failed. And poor Dan, shunned by countless Catholics, laughed at by literary critics, and weighed down by his loyalty to the people listed above, was then EXPECTED to produce a flawless tome featuring some secret group and a dead president so as to, ironically, drive more dead presidents into the coffers of Publishing and Hollywood. The perfect storm? A recipe for disaster? A million cliches apply, but \\"NO PRESSURE\\" seems most apt. Like I said, there's plenty of blame to go around.    (And if you want to read a less caustic but truly entertaining review, check out Valannin's. It's clever and way too funny!)
078322611X|5.0|I met Bill Kinsella in the early 80's. I had read a little bit about this little baseball book from a guy from British Columbia, and when I saw this clapped out car with vacu-formed signs touting a book called \\"Shoeless Joe\\" park near me, I popped over to say Hi. Bill Kinsella was/is a sort of scraggy looking dude, and was pretty interesting to talk to, so I walked with him to Elliott Bay Books, and bought a copy, which Kinsella duly signed. He re-autographed it more personally at a later reading after I told him I had called Larry King's radio show, and highly recommended it.<br />In spring of '89 I was walking past a theatre & saw a poster for a movie called \\"Field Of Dreams\\", which I had never heard of, but then I saw it had Kevin Costner, who I'd liked in [[ASIN:B00000JZI9 Silverado]] and envied in [[ASIN:0792844874 No Way Out]] for a little backseat scene with Sean Young. Then I noticed in the fine print \\"Based on the novel [[ASIN:B000PRL192 Shoeless Joe]] by W. P. Kinsella\\". I immediately bought a ticket for the next showing, and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and was all choked up at the ending. I did miss many aspects of the novel, such as the replacement of J. D. Salinger by a character called Terrence Mann(well-played by James Earl Jones), and the elimination of characters of the hero's brother, and \\"The World's Oldest Living Chicago Cub\\", Eddie \\"Kid\\" Scissons, but still thought it was well done. After I got out of the movie, I called a lady friend who I had turned on to [[ASIN:B000PRL192 Shoeless Joe]] & told her about it, and \\"Field Of Dreams\\" became the second movie I've ever watched twice in one day.(the other was [[ASIN:0783225903 Brazil]] ...how did that happen??)<br />When DVD's came out, \\"Field Of Dreams\\" was one of the first I bought, but until I bought this 2-disc set, I probably hadn't watched it in 5 or 6 years.<br />When my new copy arrived, I immediately went to the 2nd disc & the Extras. The first extra I watched was the \\"From Page To Screen\\" feature from The Bravo Channel which did little more than piss me off: Anna Geddes, who wrote & directed this knew or cared nothing about the book, or its genesis: the book [[ASIN:B000PRL192 Shoeless Joe]] was derived from a short story, the title story from Kinsella's [[ASIN:0887503438 Shoeless Joe Jackson Comes to Iowa]]. I also had a problem with the way the narrator of \\"From Page To Screen\\" went on and on about \\"an American classic\\", but didn't mention the facts that Kinsella is Canadian, or that he lived in Iowa while attending the Writer's Program at the University Of Iowa. Of course, The Bravo Channel has become a joke like A&E, living off of \\"Reality\\" TV instead of stressing quality content.<br />After my disgust with From Page To Screen, I was pretty much delighted with all the other DVD Extras: a round table discussion with Costner and some ex-MLB stars was fun; the deleted scenes were OK, with only one that I thought should have been retained in the film; I enjoyed the visit to Galena, Illinois, which served as Chisholm, Minnesota in the movie; the Look Inside \\"Field Of Dreams\\" was well done, and I realized that the director & producers really had a passion for the book and the film, and I had never, ever heard that Bill Kinsella's original title for the book was \\"Dream Field\\"; The great bit was From Father to Son: Passing Along the Pastime, with a conversation with Dwier Brown, who played the young father of Ray Kinsella, making buying this edition TOTALLY worth it. Although it was moving when the producers of the movie told of losing their Father at \\"a young age\\", Dwier Brown lost his Dad less than a month before he appeared in \\"Field Of Dreams\\" and BARELY kept it together when he talked about speaking with his Dad on the father's deathbed.<br />The transfer of the new edition was just fine, and one more thing, especially aimed at the reviewer who gave FOD 1-star due to his only getting 1 disc, in a 1 disc box:<br />When you're looking at a DVD (or abook) that has multiple editions, make sure you contact the seller either before you buy, or as soon as you buy. Confirm with the seller what you're buying: Caveat Emptor!editions, make sure you contact the seller either before you buy, or as soon as you buy.

B00275EHCI|2.0|Based on a graphic novel series, \\"Surrogates\\" has an intriguing and thoroughly believable premise: that technology will soon progress to the point where human beings no longer need to risk facing the world in their own skin.  Instead, remote controlled robotic surrogates have been universally adopted: enabling individuals to navigate through daily life using stronger, better looking, sexier versions of themselves.  Anyone can portray themselves as whomever they wish, living whatever kind of life they want to lead, living their life through idealized proxies.<br /><br />The premise of the film is dead-on in terms of what is technologically feasible within the not too distant future; and it's disturbing: what depths of dysfunction, mayhem and evil might we humans inspire-to if we no longer need to worry about personal safety, and can present ourselves as whatever sort of person we wish?  We see enough of this with the internet in today's world: how much farther will we go when we have fully functional bodies at our disposal instead of just computer screens?  A question you quickly ask of yourself while watching this film is \\"Is this a future I want?\\" The film tries to explore that question, but does so inconsistently.<br /><br />There is fair amount of notable talent is in this film, including Bruce Willis in the lead role as \\"Greer\\" (a rehash of the [[ASIN:B000O77SRC Die Hard]] character he is best known for).  Willis has some really good chase scenes in the film, especially one early-on when we have a sort of \\"Terminator\\" in reverse, where Willis's surrogate doesn't stop pursuing a bad guy, despite being partially dismembered and badly banged up.  (That we have such a scene in this film isn't too surprising, given that the director of this film, Jonathan Mostow, also directed [[ASIN:B001TK80C0 Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (Widescreen Edition)]].)  Yet, despite the Director's prior work with SciFi action/suspense films, the result here is uneven, and gets less and less compelling, if even interesting, as the plot unfolds.<br /><br />The film starts-out well, as it attempts to build on Willis's oft-seen persona as the ultimate tough guy detective.  We see leads being tenaciously uncovered and pursued, then slowly pieced together by Greer; but the too-rapid transition from a detective story to the cataclysmic end of civilization as we know it is not believable.  Also, the tension and suspense that we expect to build as such a film progresses simply is not there.<br /><br />As for the supporting characters, I have not been a fan of Rosamund Pike's work in other films, such as the femme fatale in [[ASIN:B001AQO3TW Die Another Day (James Bond) [Blu-ray]]], but she does well here as Greer's wife, managing to plumb the emotional depths of her character despite the limited and flawed opportunities she was given to do so. I was impressed with her performance, and can say that I will now look forward to seeing her in future roles.<br /><br />James Cromwell plays \\"Canter\\", the inventor of surrogate robot technology.  It is the same sort of reclusive, brilliant, eccentric scientist battling both his own inner demons and the world that we've enjoyed in his recurring role as \\"Dr. Zefrem Cochrane\\" in the Star Trek films and Dr. Alfred Lanning in [[ASIN:B0012GVKVY I, Robot [Blu-ray]]].  His talent is wasted in this film, appearing in only a few clumsy scenes.  His character's final scene, where he is confronted by Greer, deserved much better writing, directing and editing than he got.<br /><br />Ving Rhames (who is perhaps best known for his role as Marsellus Wallace in [[ASIN:B00006BSBW Pulp Fiction]]), appears here in the much too limited role of \\"The Prophet\\": a dreadlocked and somewhat mysterious leader of those humans who oppose the ersatz world being built by VSI, the company that manufactures the surrogates.  Like the other supporting actors, if not the entire film, his role and his talent have great potential here, but potentialthat is entirely untapped.  None of the actors can be faulted for their work, they simply were not given much to work-with by the film's director, writers and editors.<br /><br />The film is set entirely in and around Boston.  Like any resident of this area, I enjoyed seeing familiar landmarks throughout the film.  Yet, location does not a film make.<br /><br />In summary, despite the high powered talent, the promise of the premise, and the intriguing philosophical questions that it raises, this movie quickly descends into mediocrity and stays there, with Willis (of course) saving the day in an ending that is entirely and unintentionally anticlimactic.  Too bad.  I expect we'll see it quickly disappear from the theatres, with a DVD/BluRay release coming soon after.<br /><br />I'll give this film a two star rating: not worth spending the money to see in the theaters, nor worth buying the DVD when it first comes out; but probably something worth picking up on discount, a year or so from now.  I'm also sure that it, like other [better] Bruce Willis films, will be easy to find on late night movie channels in the not too distant future.s can be faulted for their work, they simply were not given much to work-with by the film's director, writers and editors.

0307454541|5.0|The story caught my attention from the start. I had a hard tme puting it down. My son-in-law recommended the book to me.
0060566108|4.0|There are some sections of the bookstore that don't really offer books per se but just a one-page powerpoint presentation of a trendy idea stretched far too thinly into a manuscript:  the health section with all its diet fads, the lifestyle section with all its pretentious spirituality, and the business section with all its lame management-speak.  \\"Built to Last:  Successful Habits of Visionary Companies\\" by Jim Collins and Jerry Porras is really only just a business book but for the banal business genre it's pretty good.     For one thing \\"Built to Last\\" actually says interesting things.  Its main argument is that companies that are \\"built to last\\" are so because they have some core principles that they follow religiously and which constitute their identity and their long-term vision, and outside these principles they're dynamic and flexible.  The authors point out that these habits are also indicative of successful NGOs, social/civic organizations, and government agencies -- I would even go further and point out that these habits are also indicative of a successful individual and a successful society.      Business executives who buy this book will discover two major flaws with it.  First, the book's ideas and principles are good and sound but almost impossible to implement.  The problem with being the best is that you have to be, by definition, better than everyone else.  Second, there are no concrete suggestions in the book.  \\"Preserve the Core/Stimulate Progress\\" and \\"Clock Building, Not Time Telling\\" may all be good and key but how do you implement them in an organization?  More useful to read Machiavelli or watch \\"The Godfather.\\"      What the book ultimately fails to mention is that great organizations cannot be engineered or created.  Read Malcolm Gladwell's \\"The Tipping Point\\" -- another great and perfectly useless business book -- and you realize that for a phenomenon to have impact different individuals have to play different roles at different times.  Perhaps a bookstore's business section suffers from ignoring a fundamental principle behind a business's section:  that it makes good people who are fortunate to have good ideas that are also right for the times.  But that's neither marketable nor worth mentioning, and so business writers must resort to either glibness or in the case of \\"Built to Last\\" lofty but impractical management-speak.

0385504225|3.0|I have been a dedicated reader of books which explore that which lives below the surface.  It started I hate to say with Chariots of the Gods.  With that said I plowed through Lost Symbol and truly was totally absorbed, fascinated, and thoughtfully stimulated on my favorite subjectuntil the end.  Dan Brown has a way of getting into arcana in his books that provide an incredibly good story while explaining something that many of us yearn to know, Why are we here?  Unfortunately when I got to the end it ended in a BUST!  I know from working for the government that many secrets are surpisingly obvious and not that revelatory.  Dan Brown's ending was not revelatory.  It did not hold the secret of such magnitude that it must be held back from the public lest it cause mass turmoil.  Now, noetics that was quite interesting and revelatory but not Dan's ending.  To have such a blah ending to such a gripping ride through the arcane history of the Masons and the history of our nation's capitol was just not a worthy ending.  Elsewise the book was great but alas at the end it felt like eating white bread.  No satisfaction.  No drive to continue to ask What lies under the surface.
0385504225|1.0|On top of all the other excellent reviews of this poor book, add questionable product mentions.    Chapter 1 is only 3.5 pages and there are five name-brand identifications of products.    On page 1, there are mentions of an Otis elevator and a Falcon 2000EX corporate jet with Pratt & Whitney engines.     And, Langdon, wearing a Harris Tweed jacket, is picked up a Lincoln Town Car .    The books has many other mentions, few of which serve any real purpose to the plot or even the visual context of a scene. The effect is commercialization, even though I doubt it was intended to benefit Brown directly.

0517543052|5.0|One of the sayings in Be Here Now is \\"painted cakes do not satisfy hunger\\" (preceding the bibliography I believe), meaning that books themselves are not the Way. However, during my formative spiritual transformation all those many years ago this book helped to set me upon the Way, and it's a book that I still visit with from time to time, to be reminded of all the many possibilities and well worn paths toward becoming a more conscious human being.<br /><br />I've often wondered how this book would hold up over time, but am reminded that when this book was first presented to me I thought it completely weird, only to fully embrace what it held some months later (\\"Dislodging a green nut from a shell is almost impossible, but let it dry and the lightest tap will do.\\" - Ramakrishna, quoted in BHN, pertaining to readiness). \\"May those who have Eyes, See; and those who have Ears, Hear\\", and if so, I believe this book has the requisite grace to still inspire people who thirst for more, and to \\"seek and ye shall find.\\"<br /><br />For me, it's no exaggeration to say that BHN has been my bible, and I can only hope that today's audience can overlook some of the dated contexts to discover the underlying truths, because the truth will indeed set you free.
014241493X|5.0|I read this book as an assignment for a young adult lit class, and I loved it. I literally couldn't put the book down. At 2 a.m., I found myself sitting at the end of my bed, laughing out loud (seriously, none of that fake \\"lol\\" stuff). I think I may have cried a couple of times, too. John Green writes realistically, and he writes well. Be warned, though, if you're buying this for your children, that Green writes like 17-year-old boys talk, so there is some objectionable language in the novel. Overall, though, the book rocks. :)
B001RIY4WE|2.0|I am a Blu-ray noob, but I could not get past the BD-Live features of this disc and watch the movie.  It did play on another player, but it was slow, and the Skynet menus, etc., did not add anything worthwhile.  I would avoid this version since Amazon does not allow returns if it doesn't work in your equipment.  Get the non-Skynet version instead.      I do give it 2 stars because it is still a great movie, but the picture quality, while better than DVD, is not up to newer HD releases if you have a screen capable of 1920 resolution.
6303593666|3.0|I had been hearing about this film and Leni Riefenstahl every now and then for over a decade and I finally decided that I had to see what all the fuss was about. Some of the scenes are interesting and some of the scenes are a little scary. But the long parts showing the parades are, after a while, kind of boring. Still the film generally has a unique character and a way of drawing one back into the terrifying atmosphere and ambience of that period of history - sort of like a reminder of where the world would be better not to ever go again.
0143038583|3.0|I could have given this book a 5/5, but a couple things forced me not to.    First, the grammar is atrocious. Missing commas, too many ands and ors, and simple linguistic mistakes. There are spelling errors also. It was like the book wasn't edited, and was written by someone with a 5th grade grammar education.    Second, the liberal bias is inherent. There is a lot of good information in this book, but blaming the Nixon administration and praising New Deal programs has no place in this book. It will only scare some people away. I really don't see the need to bring politics into a book informing people about the food industry. Don't get me wrong, it's not prevalent, but if I wanted to read about politics, I'd go to the political science section of the library.    If I were to review the facts about the food industry revealed in this book, I'd give it a 5/5. Alas, I found myself tempted to rip out my hair, because of the grammar, and at times disinterested from the politics. I recommend reading this book, especially if you don't know about the evils of the food industry already. However, be warned of elementary grammar mistakes and political insertions.
0316001821|3.0|I loved this book and was excited for the possibilities.  However, at some point near the end, it became completely unreal and that ruined it for me.

0439023491|5.0|\\"Catching Fire\\" was just as good as the \\"Hunger Games.\\" Very exciting. Suzanne Collins writes like a movie--constant action. I'm a mother and I love how this book appeals to both young and older audiences. I also appreciate how she doesn't use any profanity or vulgar language. There is a lot of killing and gore, but I think she is tasteful in her descriptions. There is no sex, only slight allusions to situations that she herself is not involved in. Overall, she leaves you with a sense of what it means to be human, how it's hard to stand up and make a difference but sometimes it's inevitable.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|I'm another one of those who grew up with Beatles music from the beginning. I have worked in music studios for several years and like to think I have a decent ear. With this new collection I can finally hear more detail: better bass, crisper acoustic guitar,sharper electric guitars and cleaner percussion on many of the songs which wasn't the case with the '87 CD's. It was nice to hear \\"Day Tripper\\" without that annoying drop off of the guitar riff after the bridge and \\"Paperback Writer\\" with the echo laden intro is like the original US single. Most surprising was Sgt. Pepper which especially sounded fresh and had quite a few aural surprises as well, like the lead guitar at the end of track 1 \\"Sgt.Pepper\\". I bought the vinyl mono the very day it was released and haven't heard it like this in years.<br />I go ahead and buy the stereo versions of Beatles for Sale, AHDN, Help!,Rubber Soul, Revolver,SPLHCB,MMT,White Album, Let It Be, Past Masters and Abbey Road. (To me the 1999 version of \\"Yellow Submarine\\" is exceptional<br />Now, heres my complaint about the Mono box: The White Album! I realize it is different from the Stereo version but, some of it is just seems sloppy. Every Harrison song is not as well done in this mono version as well as Ringo's one contribution. \\"Don't Pass Me By\\". It sounds sped up and it's bearly listenable. \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" ends badly with Claptons guitar over flanged/distorted towards the end and the song cuts off too soon. \\"Piggies\\" has a loud distorted pig grunt in the second verse and at the end. \\"Long, Long, Long\\" starts off badly and \\"Savoy Truffle\\" has a lead guitar part misplaced or not intended. Theres no classic Ringo yelling \\"There's blisters on my fingers!\\" at the end with \\"Helter Skelter\\". The few shining moments do not out-weigh these blunders. If this is the way the British Mono Version was intended then I'm surprised.<br />However,on the bright side,the acoustic numbers like \\"Blackbird\\", \\"Julia\\", \\"I Will\\" and \\"Mother Natures Son\\" do stand out . It was never released in the US in mono (or in the UK originaly) as the Beatles recorded/mixed/mastered this first Apple Album release in stereo. The stereo version is much better (and familiar) and well worth the extra money.<br /><br />1.Please, Please Me:5 stars<br />2.With The Beatles:5 stars<br />3.A Hard Days Night:4 stars mono/ 5 stereo<br />4.Beatles For Sale:4 stars/ 5 stereo<br />5.Help: 5 stars (mono/stereo)<br />6.Rubber Soul:5 stars (mono/stereo)<br />7.Revolver: 5 stars (mono/stereo)<br />8.Sgt. Pepper: 5 stars (mono/stereo)<br />9.Magical Mystery Tour: 4 stars(5 stars stereo)<br />10.White Album:3 stars(5 stars stereo)<br />11.Past Masters: 4 stars<br /><br />It is great the hear these songs as they were orginally meant to be heard.(Yes, USA purists know the American versions had some differences as well. Then the Capitol Boxes maybe are the answer and of course,vinyl still rules).<br /><br />I do have one other small gripe (this applies to both mono and stereo versions): Why didn't they add \\"text\\"? After all the time and effort to modernize these gems after all these years it would have been nice to have the text.

0385504225|3.0|`The Lost Symbol' is Dan Brown's long-awaited follow-up to `The DaVinci Code', and like `The DaVinci Code' and its predecessor `Angels & Demons', `The Lost Symbol' is immersed in symbology, lavish art in a beautiful city, a secret society, an improbable bad guy, and a thrilling chase.  Brown definitely has a winning formula, and he sticks closely to it again, replacing Rome, Paris, and London with Washington DC; the Illuminati and Knights Templar with the Masons; and a lunatic priest and lunatic albino with a tattooed lunatic.  The hero, Robert Langdon, is again summoned to help out a friend and is in for more than he had bargained for, finding himself in a life-or death quest to fix an immediate problem by solving ancient secrets and riddles.    To contrast `Symbol' a little with its predecessors, there is less action here than in the others.  From a pure thrills perspective, `Symbols' is the inferior to both.  Thematically, this book is superior to `The DaVinci Code': if `Code' had a theme, it was overshadowed by the Mary Magdalene issue.  `Symbol' is inferior however to `Angels & Demons', which effectively incorporated its theme of science versus faith into the plot.  The themes of `Symbol' are interesting.  The theological ideas of finding the true nature of god inside each of us and using our minds to change the world for the better are timely, and I think, as does Brown if the last word of the novel reflects his beliefs, hopeful.  The scientific sub-theme of Noetics was also fascinating.  I would have liked all of this better incorporated into the plot though.    Brown still hasn't learned to write.  In fact, his writing seems to have gotten worse.  A rambling 50-page denouement and constant melodramatic peeks into the characters' thoughts (Dear God..., Is this really the end?) needlessly clutter the prose. 50-75 pages could have cut to make this a tighter and better book.  It's sad to think one of the most famous and best-selling authors in the world really can't write all that well.  But the guy can tell a story.  He knows how to write a thriller.  He writes about the most fascinating subjects.  He's developed a great hero in Langdon, likable, smart, and mostly human.  And how he comes up with those codes is pure genius.    Brown fans will buy this book and like it.  For those interested in reading Brown for the first time, I recommend starting with `Angels' and working up chronologically.  For intellectual high-brows or artistic snobs, look elsewhere.  But they probably already knew that.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Alan Ball's True Blood series works largely because he is such an excellent writer.  I really should never have doubted that after he pulled off 6 FEET UNDER and AMERICAN BEAUTY, that he could also pull off this.  He adapted the material from Charlain Harris's popular Sookie Stackhouse novels. There is another reason this succeeds though.  Once again an Oscar winning actress, Anna Paquin, known only as a film actress, came aboard as the lead character, Sookie Stackhouse. a  mind reader.  It makes a huge difference when actors who made it in film, agree to do tv, a previously unheard of crossover. Cary Grant back in the '60s, although he loved tv, would never agree to do it, laying down the edict that \\"film actors never do tv\\". Film actors followed that advice for decades but, in this decade, that old chestnut was finally put to rest for good. Likewise film actors are now giving super models the permanent axe because they now do advertising and, of course, they do it better.  It is win-win for those of us in the viewing public--of any media.<br /><br />This series has an ideal Southern Goth setting in a rural, swampy Louisiana parrish. There is no doubt vampires exist.  They even have legal rights. Thus, no screen time is wasted on disbelief in vampires, which has already been done countless times. An immediate romantic interest is set up with Paquin and a vampire, played by Stephen Moyer, who was made into a vampire at the end of the Civil War. However, her employer, owner of Merlotte's diner, is also interested in her,  played by Sam Trammell. I enjoy Paquin's brother, played by Ryan Kwanten.  He is an airhead and knows it and is a nice contrast to Pacquin's character.<br /><br />One warning: this is a very gory and sexually graphic tv series.  It is done in a rather campy, over the top manner but if you do not like explicit sex, gore and violence, this is NOT for you.<br /><br />HBO rarely misses and once again it has scored with this series.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B001KVZ6G6|4.0|Considering I paid about $40 for the 2 disc DVD set of BUgs life 3 or 4 years ago, I think $28 for 2 Disc BLu-ray, + the DVD, + the digital copy is a pretty good value.

1416562605|5.0|This novel illuminates both the hardship and resilience of a young, brilliant man in India who is born with as little hope as a spider but turns his life around through a series of increasingly malicious acts.  The real achievement of the novel is that the reader never loses empathy for him despite his unethical behavior because the author has painted a portrait of a landscape so bleak and hopeless that, in the end, we can't really blame him for doing anything he can to escape.
1416594787|5.0|Many non-scientists, like me, have wondered, why do 99% of all scientists believe in evolution?  Isn't it just a Theory?  an opinion?  How can the vote be so unanimous?  99% is a huge number.    I have been told that there is no evidence for evolution, it is a theory just made up by people who are angry at God and that it is stupid that people came from monkeys.    If you are like me and really want to understand the evidence for evolution honestly, and objectively, this is an excellent book.     Richard Dawkins's ability to lucidly explain complicated scientific information to anyone willing to take the time to listen and understand is impressive.     Once I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down.      Based on the mountain of evidence presented in this book, I now understand that the people telling me that evolution is stupid must be completely unaware of the evidence.  I am thinking of giving this book as a Christmas gift for the members of my family that believe that there is no evidence for evolution.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|What can I say that hasnt already been said!  After ordering this through Amazon I received it yesterday.  I'm amazed at the care and consideration given to producing this package.      At present I am listening to Norweigan Wood - it takes me back over 40 years - I was just a little girl - in fact I was all of seven years old when Beatlemania hit Australia.  Yes - I have Beatles records which I no longer play and CDs released previously - but the quality of sound on these - you are able to really appreciate their harmonies.    So well done!  What a great way to spend the afternoon - taking a trip down memory lane - while a dust storm rages outside!    I would recommend this to any Beatles fan - whether young or old.  Money very well spent!!

069111966X|5.0|After more than 50 years, Polya's advice on tackling problems is still worth reading. But be warned, this is not the latest, brightest, trendiest, best-selling \\"problem solving book\\" out there that target MBAs or a kind of personal self-development book. Its author had contributed to important fields of mathematics and he had been through many problems, many difficulties, many students and many different questions by those students.<br /><br />If you're a young but eager student who faces problems in math (or in natural sciences), a person trying to solve some puzzles or practical problems, or a researcher about to start a long and unguaranteed journey in order to solve a big problem then you owe yourself to have this classic on your bookshelf, or better on your table.<br /><br />I'd like to quote some important passages from the book but last time I checked my notes they are about as long as the book. So maybe it is better to let Polya do the talking...

6305736650|5.0|You cannot go wrong with Casablanca!<br /><br /> The story is well-known:  The beginning of World War II, many immigrated to North Africa and points on the African coast, in advance of the German push into France.  From Casablanca, one could, with the right persuasion, hop to Lisbon (Portugal, of course) and from there, escape to America.<br /><br /> The film defies definition.  It's not a drama, yet there are dramatic scenes.  It is not truly a love story, yet there are elements of that.  It's not a statement about immigration, yet many wish to escape.<br /><br /> An escapee of a concentration camp and freedom fighter, Victor Laslo (Paul Henreid) finds his way into Casablanca, hoping to get a plane out and back to the USA and help the Americans (this part of the story was vague).  He brings with him his wife, Ilsa, played adoringly and smartly by Ingrid Bergman.<br /><br /> Ilsa walks into Rick's Cafe Americane and who does she see -- the guy who she had a fling with and dumped in Paris -- and Rick (Bogart) is not over it!<br /><br /> Intrigue:  Black marketeer and competitor, played devilishly by Sydney Greenstreet (Maltese Falcon), wants Rick's for himself.  He also wants what Rick has -- letters of passage to America, which he could sell for a handsome profit.<br /><br /> Rick is torn -- he does not want to get involved with the Nazis that have invaded his bar; he does not want to help Laslo, and most of all he wants to forget Ilsa -- and can't understand why she abandoned him in Paris -- he didn't know she was married -- oops!<br /><br /> Peter Lorre (also with The Maltese Falcon) plays a slimy gangster who bumped off a couple of German couriers and passes their letters of transit to Rick -- who keeps them for himself!<br /><br /> Many famous lines and music have come from this one film:  Play it Sam (no one ever said \\"Play it again Sam\\" as is rumored); \\"This could be the start of a beautiful friendship\\"; \\"Here's looking at you, kid;\\" and \\"We'll always have Paris.\\"<br /><br /> The DVD set is great.  Not only is the gorgeous black & white cleaned up and theater quality, but the second disk has film critics and film historians in the commentary, including our pal Roger Ebert, who calls this the second greatest film he's ever watched (the first is Citizen Kane).<br /><br /> Lauren Bacall, Bogart's son, Ingrid Bergman's daughter, everyone has a say.

0385504225|3.0|After enjoying all of Brown's books and almost 3/4's of this one, I was amazed that a gifted storyteller could throw all his sub-plots into a blender and puree every one of them.  Dan Brown is not Shakespeare nor do I expect great literature from him, but I usually get alternative takes on historic facts, scavenger-hunt-esque adventure and a thought provoking ending albeit through his tried and true formula of mentor/friend really being the bad guy.  (The rest is Spoiler coming if you haven't read the book yet). So, I was highly relieved that Peter Solomon was not really \\"in on it\\" . Yet as predictable as that would have been for Brown, it was less predictable than who the bad guy really was.  Did anybody NOT see that coming? And that is just the first of so many let downs.       I'm racking my brain why the CIA (and not the FBI) was involved due to the National Security implications.  So, as an avid try-to-guess-what's-coming-reader, I assume Katherine's research into how group thought(prayer)can affect events and CIA involvement and Ma'lach's determination to destroy all her research...I'm thinking he will somehow cause the whole world to think about some awful thing, say nuclear annihilation or world wide plague or forcing everyone to read this book.  But the intriguing twists Noetic Science could have produced never materialized.  Katherine could have worked at a 7-11 and the plot would not have been affected.      The government involvement was actually laughable.  Since when is a politician caught on tape doing something morally reprehensible a crisis of utmost importance?  Has Brown been living on a deserted island the last six years?  When the Architect was shocked into cooperation, I suspected piles of bloody bodies that were a sign of things to come from the villain.  But it was a handful of politicians in their Mason regalia performing initiations?  How many governors, senators, Presidents have we caught in far more compromising situations?  Most are still in office.      But most disappointing is the end after the end.  Ok, Langdon ran all over town decoding this and that and told us alot about art and Ancient Mysteries which is what I enjoy.  He made several references to King Solomon, yet there's no connection to the Solomon family who was entrusted with the pyramid?  The Masons knew where the \\"treasure\\" was the whole time?  What was the point in the secret pyramid and capstone?  The most obvious place where it could be is where it really is?  It's not really a bunch of informative scrolls passed down through the ages that tell us people really can make things happen just by thinking about it.  Come on, it's the Bible?  Did the Catholic Church sue Brown and this is his punishment?    Brown had so many potential plot twists and ways to tie everything together and he didn't.  I felt as if he wrote down ideas that came to him on little scraps of paper and pasted them all together.  I wouldn't have been so disappointed if someone else had wrote this book.
0380973839|4.0|I enjoyed THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES, which is essentially a collection of loosely connected short stories about the world's attempt to colonize Mars over a thirty-year period.  While I don't consider this novel a masterpiece like Bradbury's brilliantly dystopian FAHRENHEIT 451, it's still a very fine effort that's worth your time.<br /><br />While THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES is technically a work of science fiction, it contains very little hard science.  Most of the stories are really just an excuse for Bradbury to engage in some biting social commentary.  I found most of the stories to be a complete pleasure to read.  Many of them are written in a witty, whimsical style.  Bradbury is not a particularly subtle writer, but I do admire his sharp satirical voice, especially when it comes to his insights into the dark side of human nature.<br /><br />This book was written in the 1940s, and reads a bit like a relic from an earlier era.  Stories that were probably cutting edge for their time (such as the story condeming racism) now come across as quite obvious and heavy-handed.  The book's central concept -- humanoid life on Mars -- is also quite laughable by modern scientific standards.  So if you're looking for modern, cutting edge SF, THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES is probably not for you.  I would instead recommend Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars novels written in the 1990s, which are far more scientifically believable.<br /><br />But if you enjoy tales with strong humanistic themes, THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES is quite satisfying.  It's imaginative, well written, and its moral messages are right on target.  This book is considered by many to be one of the greats, and I can definitely see why.

B0015AARJI|4.0|First of all I own 2 of the dualshock controllers. One of them I just had replaced through a warranty. The controller works well, it gives good tactile feedback and for me personally, the size is just right. The only gripe I have with these controllers is that they aren't exactly durable.     I have never had to replace any controllers for ANY game system I have ever owned. The PS3 controllers cannot stand up to the same use as controllers of the past. These are definitely NOT made to the same standards as controllers of the past.     Some examples of issue I've had with my PS3 controllers (dualshock and regular six axis):   -L2 and R2 button springs stop working   -the sticks become too loose or don't center properly   -the stick movement becomes too stiff (opposite of the above)     I have owned 8 PS3 controllers overall and experienced issues with 4 of them. I love the controllers but I don't buy them without warranties anymore.
0385504225|3.0|I'm one of those readers who stops reading if not \\"grabbed\\" within the first 50 pages. I almost threw this one away. First of all, this centers around the Mason's, a group I don't really care much about and certainly don't fear as a conspiracy of any kind. Most of Brown's books grab and hold me and I care about the characters. I had a lot of trouble caring what happened to any of the characters in this book. The writing is on a par with Ian Fleming's early work and just as silly. The evil is evil, pure and simple, but the good is unclear. Some have called this formulaic and that is pretty accurate. The Da Vinci Code was a good read, of not a great one, and it held me all the way through. The Lost Symbol meanders around and is vague about so many things, including \\"why should anyone care about this stuff?\\" The global threat makes no sense because real life is even sillier than this plot. I put it in the summer reading class. It's too bad it didn't come out at the beginning of the summer as it is a good beach read, nothing more.
0385504225|3.0|It's been a few years since I've read Dan Brown's previous novels, so I can't fairly compare.  I know I enjoyed them and read them quickly, but I don't remember much about the plots.  Lost Symbol will probably be remembered in the same way.  It was entertaining and easy to read.  My only real complaint (pet peeve) with the novel was that very other chapter seemed to end with a cliffhanger as the story progressed.  I know it's supposed to be a suspenseful story, but so many cliffhangers got a little tiresome.
B002GZQYMK|2.0|I have in the past been impressed by Muse and their unique sound. While their vocals have always been sort of run of the mill the band has always offered something slightly different from the hodge podge of monotonous sounds that stream across the alternative rock radio stations these days.     With this new album however Muse has taken a big gamble to try and go in what this listener feels is a new direction. With the first few songs you already get a feel that things are not the same with this new album. Though they still feel inherit to the bands sound, they are some how lack luster. From there, it only gets worse.     The trouble begins when Muse makes a futile attempt to bash the United States. There are two things, generally, that can destroy a band. The first of which is if they completely change their sound. The second, is a band that is previously a non politically charged entity all of the sudden deciding to go down that risky path. Not only does muse do this but they do it with one track (arguably two). The pointless mutterings of a band that some how feels this track (the united states of euraisa) belongs in the pantheon of their otherwise non offensive musical venues. It is such an out of place song, that it gives the rest of the album this ever present bad taste. It is a damaging track without reason and simply does not belong.      Eventually, we get to the the last few songs of the album. A smattering of random sounds form the band and whales from the lead singer. An attempt to be something that they are not, a (as they would put it) \\"symphony\\" that lacks any coherence or harmony. These last few tracks are actually a bit jarring to listen to, and something that this listener will not be going through again.     Has Muse lost its its way? Have their talents somehow dried up, or have they got caught up in fame and lost their original vision? It is difficult to say. While the band still has undisputed talent, with this album it seems to be mis-aimed. One thing is certain, The Resistance is either the beginning of a downward spiral from an otherwise noteworthy band, or simply a blunder in the life of what is Muse, only time will tell.

0307473473|5.0|I enjoy thriller/crime novels to a certain extent but pick them up for light reading since, while usually engrossing from a story perspective, the characters are not developed well and I usually forget the books soon after reading them. This novel is the exception to that gross generalization.<br /><br />Originally published in Sweden and then translated to English and brought to the United States recently, it is very obvious the author is Swedish. Most of the action takes place in Stockholm and areas north where the two main characters (Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander) try to solve the disappearance of a young girl many years before. This isn't just the one story moving forward, there is also the story of the Mikael Blomkvist's career as a financial journalist who has been convicted of libel and other stories woven into the narrative. The reader has to pay close attention at the beginning of the book to keep the players and story lines straight but well worth the effort.<br /><br />The characters are wonderfully drawn and interesting. The plot is great and I found myself reading all 644 pages in four days. I will warn you that there are some very disturbing parts to the novel. There is graphic violence and images that were difficult to read - not for the faint of heart!

B002C6K7N0|5.0|Will this album satisfy Megadeth fans, yessss, will this album satisfy metal fan, yess... will this album satisfy Marty Friedman fans, not really. I have to admitt that I never thought that Megadeth will be able to deliver an album worthy of listening w/o Friedman. However, I have always been a fan of Megadeth, even before the RIP lineup. For all of us that loved that lineup there will never be nothing like it, even if they pulled albums like Risk, some fans will still consider that lineup golden. In my opinion it has never been about the best lineup, but the best music. And once and for all, let Friedman and the Metallica/Megadeth issue gooo.. Endgame is Megdadeth's best album since Count Down, bar none... many fans accuse Endgame of having endless choruses, what about Youthanasia??? Endgame is the most progressive, agressive and complex album since RIP. It has all of the elements that we loved about Countdown and all the solos and double bass drumming that RIP delivered. Although I am not a big fan of commercial success, I sure do hope that Megadeth finally get the recognition they deserve, and at the end Mustaine did it w/o the help of Friedman and the others. Broderick delivers flawlessly... Yes GET THIS ALBUM!!! Metal album of the year no doubt....

The movie is ridiculous (we actually laughed many times at how bad it was) and the special effects are the worst I've seen in years.  Needless to say, we didn't watch it until the end.  Don't waste your money on this.  I'd give this zero stars if I could.
0142407380|5.0|Ark Angel Summary    14 year old MI6 agent, Alex Rider, Was shot right above the heart and went to St. Dominic's hospital where he met Paul Drevin, multi-billionaire Nicoli Drevin's son, and saved him from eco terrorists force three by sacrificing himself. Alex escapes from the terrorists and goes to get the police. When Nicoli Drevin hears of this he goes to meet Alex. Alex gets invited to the Drevin's private island, but first Drevin has some business to settle in New York. When they got to New York, Alex's passport was denied. The Airport security said that Alex had to stay there and that they could pick him up when they got back. When the Drevins left, one of the security guards takes Alex to the CIA where they tell Alex that they switched his passport so they could tell him that Drevin is the most dangerous man alive and that they need his help to look after him. When they get him back to the airport and the Drevins come to pick him up, Alex does not feel safe anymore. When they get to Flamingo Bay, Alex sees one of the rockets that are being used to make a space hotel called Ark Angel. When Drevin finds out that Alex is a spy he decides to kill him. So he sends Alex scuba diving with one of his assistants and he locks him in a chamber of a sunken ship. When Alex is just about to run out of air, Drevins secretary comes and finds Alex. She tells him that her name is Tamara Knight and that she is an agent for the CIA but she couldn't tell him that before. Drevin eventually catches Alex and Tamara and tells them his plan because he was going to kill them anyway. He tells them that the space hotel was wasting too much money and that he was sending up a bomb to send Ark Angel hurtling down towards Washington D.C. Tamara tells Alex that he need to get out of there and to go to Barbados to get another Agent, Ed Shulsky. When Alex finds Ed Shulsky, they go back to the island and free Tamara and defeat Drevin, but the bomb hasn't been stopped. They decide to send Alex up after the bomb to defuse it, but Alex is hesitant. When they finally convince Alex to go up, he finds Drevins right hand man who tries to kill him. Alex ends up blinding sending a knife through the man head. After the battle, Alex goes and finds the bomb and puts in the middle of Ark Angel so instead of going down towards earth, it explodes into billions of pieces. When Alex gets back to earth, he is congratulated by the C.I.A and MI6 while feeling his own pride. Looks like he does it again!

0385342020|4.0|Fans of Sophie Kinsella's \\"shopaholic\\" character, Becky Bloomfield, know what it's like to want to both hug and strangle somebody at the same time. Sophie's newest heroine in TWENTIES GIRL, Lara Lington, is almost normal by comparison; the only urge is to perhaps embrace her. Well, she does see dead people - or at least one dead person in particular. But what's one idiosyncrasy among friends?<br /><br />Lara, striving mightily but not too successfully in a start-up, executive placement firm, has a common set of problems: over-attentive parents that worry too much, an insufferable business partner, a failed love life, a meager income, and few prospects to improve on any of these.<br /><br />Lara's great-aunt, Sadie Lancaster, living out her life to age 105 in an old-age home and pretty much ignored by the rest of the family, Lara and her parents included, has recently died. It's while attending the memorial service that Sadie's ghost reveals herself to Lara with the strident demand that the latter track down the deceased's favorite necklace, which has gone missing. Why the spirit haunts only her niece is never explained, but no matter. Sadie takes the form of her prime, 23-year old self as she was during the 1920s, when she lived life fast and loose and to the full; her character achieves a stature in the story almost rivaling that of Lara. Readers of TWENTIES GIRL thus get two endearing protagonists for the price of one.<br /><br />About two-thirds of the way through the book, I realized the author was perhaps influenced by the film [[ASIN:B00000JLWW Titanic]], in which, if you remember, there's an aged survivor in possession of a missing necklace that was the only thing worn by a young woman when her portrait was painted by a lover at the high point of a tragically brief love affair.<br /><br />The plot of TWENTIES GIRL seemed a bit contrived, at times awkwardly so. Thus, only four stars from me. Perhaps the most valuable lesson to be learned is the one that Lara comes to appreciate, which is that old people were once youthful and vibrant. While observing a group of frail residents in Aunt Sadie's former old age home as they listen to a recording of 1920s tunes, Lara realizes:<br /><br />\\"\\"They're all in their twenties inside. All that white hair and wrinkled skin is just cladding. The old man with the oxygen tank was probably once a dashing heartthrob. That woman with distant rheumy eyes was once a mischievous young girl who played pranks on her friends. They were all young, with love affairs and friends and parties and an endless life ahead of them ... It's as if I can see them, the way they were.

But, she was young once; I have the pictures. As a pre-teen girl astride a mule in a national park, on her college basketball team, as a novice elementary school teacher with her rural Missouri pupils, and with her infant daughter, my mother.<br /><br />It's perhaps too much to expect that the truth Lara discovered be learned while still relatively young.

B00275EHCI|3.0|Remember many years ago when people didn't have the use of cell phones and now it seems like we can't get by without having one? Well, the comic book adapted sci-fi action thriller \\"SURROGATES\\" does take a little stab at that idea; but in this case, it is the use of artificial beings engineered to make our lives easier. Directed by Jonathan Mostow (U-571), the film based on a screenplay by Michael Ferris and John Broncato, the film feels a little of a mixed bag in my book. The film captures the backdrop of the comic book by Robert Venditti and Brett Weldele but misses its message. There have been major alterations to the graphic novel's story that gave it a more crowd-pleasing atmosphere.<br /><br />Several years ago, a scientist named Dr. Lionel Canter (James Francis Ginty/ later played by James Cromwell) has invented a \\"Surrogates\\" robotic technology that can allow injured people independent mobility, soldiers go to the battlefield without risking their lives, among other applications. Since then, for the sake of profit, VSI has adapted the technology for commercial use where regular people can use the robots as avatars to do their daily routine. The look of the life-like robot would depend on the preferences of the user, as well as certain on-board enhancements and features that can make one's job a little more easier to do while the `operator` is safe in one`s own home (example: a police surrogate would be faster, stronger and more maneuverable than the average model). When an important surrogate is destroyed and its operator killed with it with a special military weapon, FBI agent Greer (Bruce Willis) and his partner agent Peters (Radha Mitchell) is sent in to investigate. Following its clues and his surrogate destroyed by firearms, agent Greer enters the community where humans have opted out of the `surrogate' use under the leadership of a charismatic prophet (Ving Rhames) and must now face the everyday perils without his \\"buffer\\"; that includes his own wife (played by Rosamund Pike)...<br /><br />Being adapted from the graphic novel, the movie \\"Surrogates\\" looks very sharp and I am pretty sure director Mostow intended the film to capture the tone of the comic. The work in photography and the visual effects are pretty good (but some looked better than others) and the film is nicely shot. Mostow uses some visual enhancements so that \\"surrogates\\" can be distinguished from the actual human being; they have near silky like skin, somewhat emotionless eyes, and very nice features. The film's screenplay revolves around this network of `surrogates', the tension and mystery slowly unraveling as the film makes the viewer ponder just what is ethical and which is not in the use of the artificial beings? What is the balance between technological advancements and emotional detachments? Is life worth living through the electronic eyes of a robot or should life be experienced first hand?<br /><br />The film does manage to touch upon the lost of identity when in the use of such technology. People use them to stay safe, be successful and sometimes to feed their own vanity without risks to themselves. I liked the way \\"Surrogates\\" manages to bring the doubts brought about without actual human contact, much like today's internet age that would make one wonder if the face behind the picture is the same. How do you know if a sexy female surrogate is controlled by an actual woman? Well, agent Greer and his wife, Maggie have models that looked very similar to their actual features. Maggie (played by Rosamund Pike) has gone into emotional seclusion after the loss of their son and has allowed her surrogate to take over all their daily routine. John Greer is longing to feel his own wife's attention and love. Their relationship is made almost immaterial, after all, would a wife be cheating if her surrogate is the one who sleeps with another surrogate?<br /><br />Director Mostow does have the right ideas in mind, but certain themes are only touched upon but abandoned in favor for the `whodunit' mystery and conspiracy theories at its core. It was obvious that the film was adapted to please the audiences of the multiplexes; while this isn't exactly a bad thing, it does present a lot of missed opportunities in the screenplay. I liked certain parts of the mystery and the film's ideas about `atonement', but deep down the film feels more like an action film than an actual sci-fi thriller whose story revolves around the concept of the losing `touch' and its emotional repercussions. There is a compelling tale around here, sadly its powerful social commentary gets lost amid the action and the mystery behind this `weapon'. This mystery while interesting at first, gets a little too clich&eacute;d. The potential for the `surrogate' feels more like fragmented story pieces and used only as a backdrop than a real integral part of the film. I sure wished that the relationship between Greer and his wife, and their son's loss be more fleshed out; as well as how other people are coping with this technology. It really bothered me that the movie changed several things from the graphic novel. Also, the film doesn't make a compelling argument as to why such a technology be so accepted and can go so mainstream around the world. I guess director Mostow is trying to tell his audience not to be lazy or afraid; he gets the point across but not as convincing or as dramatic as I would've wished.<br /><br />\\"Surrogates\\" does have some decent action sequences. I guess to compensate, Mostow tries to overload the screen with enough PG-13 violence as he could possibly fit into the film. I liked the scenes with chase with the \\"Peters\\" surrogate and the Greer \\"surrogate\\" was definitely cool while on pursuit mode. When it comes to rehearsed visual effects, explosions and style, the film doesn't disappoint. However, the film's resolution was never in doubt, and the film does fall into the usual trappings of sci-fi action thrillers. Bruce Willis does feel a little out of his element at times but he had enough charisma to pull off his role. I guess the supporting cast wasn't so bad, although most of them were acting like emotionless `surrogates'.<br /><br />\\"Surrogates\\" has enough things going for it that the film manages to take off. I guess while I tempered my expectations, I still couldn't ignore the fact that it missed its potential for raw emotions, and for a film that is supposed to be humanity's detachment from life, it felt a little too mechanical and hollow. The film is decent, if you look at it from a popcorn film standpoint, but \\"Surrogates\\" should be a lot more than that. The film should have been strong in pitching several issues about our reliance to technology, and on this, the film falters. Changing several key elements (especially the climax) from the graphic novel made the film pretty mechanical and never realizes the humanity behind the story.<br /><br />RENT IT  [2 ½ Stars]<br />'r the `whodunit' mystery and conspiracy theories at its core.

0385504225|2.0|As with other Dan Brown novels, The Lost Symbol is chock full of interesting (albeit sometimes debatable) historical, cultural and scientific information.  The book tackles some really fascinating topics here.  The story starts off great and Dan Brown really lays some great groundwork for what appears will be another epic story line.  However, as the plot develops, he reaches too far for shock value and this causes the story's downfall.  Without playing spoiler, there are just too many \\"oh, come on now!!\\" elements in the story.  He overuses \\"deus ex machina\\" as a tool to bring the story where he seems to think the readers what it to go...twists do NOT equal a good story and as a reader, I was fairly insulted by some of the absurd twists Brown asks us to accept.  I was entertained in the beginning but starting in the middle of the book, the story becomes redundant and absurd.  I was rather unfulfilled.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|After watching the amazing Battlestar Galactica, I went on searching for another amazing Sci-Fi TV series. I found three that popped out. Stargate, Farscape, and Firefly. These three have very good ratings and reviews. I first picked Farscape to watch because of all the aliens and stuff ... unfortunately, it was incomparable to Battlestar Galactica. The story is cliched, predictable, acting is average, and episodes don't feel like they connect very well. After about 5-6 episodes, I dropped the series.<br /><br />Then I found Firefly. If you have seen Battlestar Galactica, I think you'd agree that it's an amazing series with a story that is exciting, full of mystery, unpredictable, funny, emotional, tense, and all the things a great story should have. After watching Firefly for 3-4 episodes, I can say that it lives up to my expectation of Battlestar Galactica. Firefly is a REALLY AMAZING series that will surely entertain you, excite you, emotionize you, make you laugh, make you wonder what's going to happen next, and make you simply just have a BLAST watching it!<br /><br />If you're looking for a GREAT Sci-Fi TV series that has a great story + characters - look no further. Firefly WILL satisfy you!

B000025O03|2.0|Considering that their first two albums were among the best rock albums of the decade (the best, in my opinion), this was a surprise as well as a terrible disappointment. Noise, rage, and despair marred this collection of compositions. At times it sounds like they were tearing their instruments to pieces, if not their very selves. No musical value added by \\"Stain.\\"
B002KLAL4W|5.0|Well I didnt know what to expect from this album when i first purchased it. I had heard The Fixer over the past month and i thought is was an \\"alright\\" song/hit. I kept wondering if that song was in fact was the best JAM in this upcoming album, and was i SUPRISED and EXCITED that it wasnt! not even close! Yield is my alltime favorite Pearl Jam album and i think Backspacer gives it a run for its money. Incredible from begining to end. Great flow without skipping a track is one of the qualities i love about Yield, and now why i love Pearl Jam's newest installment.I love that theyr no longer singing about political bullsh@!t,even though world wide souicide was pretty fun! You can hear that Eddie Vedder and company are just having fun again and it pays off. Ok lets get started. If your familiar with my reviews, no need to explain lol Just keep'n it short and sweet, just like the album!<br /><br />1. Gonna see my Friend: Great opener! \\"GOOD\\" song  8/10<br />2. Got Some: Loved it on Conan, love it now!  \\"GOOD\\"  8/10<br />3. The Fixer: First big hit, nice and catchy  \\"GOOD\\" 9/10<br />4. Johnny Guitar: I love it, one of my personal faves! \\"GOOD\\" 8/10<br />5. Just Breathe: WOW AWESOME SONG, great lyrics! 2nd favorite song  \\"GREAT\\" 10/10<br />6. Amongst The Wave: My fave song! sounds like something out of Yield \\"GREAT\\" 10/10<br />7. Unthought Known: 4th Fave song! Great build up during the song \\"GOOD\\" 9/10<br />8. Supersonic: An okay song IMO, \\"GOOD\\" borderline \\"Forgetable\\" 7/10<br />9. Speed Of Sound: pretty good, not much more to say \\"GOOD\\" 8/10<br />10. Force Of Nature: AWESOME SONG!! vitalogy-ish! 3rd fave of mine! \\"GREAT\\" 10/10<br />11. The End: BEAUTIFUL, rivals Release and Inside Job as an album closer \\"GOOD\\" 9/10<br /><br />So only 1 borderline forgetable song in this incredible album, yet i wont skip it! Take some time and listen to the album, its only like 36 minutes long! its fast paced, rocks and yet has some slow songs that are too beautiful to miss! I didnt have one song to really complain about and from my other reviews, didnt have one in which id feel weird to \\"hear it loud while driving with my windows down\\" in a populated area lol. Its their best album by far in the 2000's and rivals my best pearl jam albums of the 90's!! 1. Yield, 2. Vs, 3. Ten, (4. Backspacer), 5. Vitalogy, 6. No code, 7. Pearl jam, 8. Binaural, 9. Riot Act.<br /><br />Enjoy! Plus dont forget its available as a full album downloadable content for RockBand!her reviews, didnt have one in which id feel weird to \\"hear it loud while driving with my windows down\\" in a populated area lol.

B000001GGV|5.0|This is an excellent recording of the interpretation of Domenico Scaratti by the pianist Ivo Pogorelich. I especially appreciated the selection of the 15 works that demonstrate the ability of Scarlatti to paint a range of emotions and sensations; some subtle and moody whereas some are tense and energetic to the point of mild mania and then again in other selections there are playful, witty, auditory games.    It is the range of works, all of which are interpreted with grace and precision, that leads to greater appreciation for the genius of Domenico Scarlatti as interpreted by the highly talented Pogorelich.     I also found the sequencing of the works to be very thoughtful and pleasing so that there was a nuanced flow in the presentation.    This CD is highly recommended.

0143057693|5.0|Clive Cussler is rapidly becoming another of my favorite book authors joining the ranks of Robert Ludlum and Tom Clancy. In fact, just saw a movie entitled Sahara which is based on the book by Cussler. Anyway, Polar Shift is the unabridged audio book that I just finished. Yes, written by Cussler.<br /><br />The book starts with the sinking of a passenger boat full of people escaping from Germany during WWII. The next action is the sinking in a whirlpool of a massive state-of-the-art modern cargo container ship. From that point it gets interesting... Let's see, did I mention that the world might end if the bad guys have their way?<br /><br />Wonderful book, a pleasure to listen too with a clear and easy story line to follow. Cussler Strikes Again!
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|I was a fan, read all four of his previous books.  It appears that his success has affected his work.  Took too many chapters to get into the subject of the book, too much unneeded background infomration.  Too many chapters and preaching after the climax.  The basic story was partly believable, but didn't have the realism of (this could happen or it could be true) his previous works.  Langdon was a complete wimp in this book.  A big disappointment.
B0006N2EZ0|4.0|If one can gather from the success of this film, don't always listen to the critics reviews--they can be wrong too.  For instance, the esteemed critics, Siskel and Ebert once dismissed a film called \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\" as just fluff but history proved that the film would endure and in fact has had several DVD releases including one in Blu-ray.  I'm not saying that this film is an artistic triumph like Costner's \\"Dances with Wolves\\" or Eastwood's latest films like \\"The Changeling\\" or \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\", but as a pulp film, it's a success.  My acting coach at the time in San Francisco called it \\"enjoyable trash\\" and I agree with her. If you don't expect a lot, you'll get a lot.  I really like that this film in the pre-Obama era, played down the inter-racial angle and more the conflict between celebrity and private life.  Like Obama has stated there are more important issues to deal with than just the racial aspect--and this film proved it.  Houston was never more alluring and Costner is pitch perfect as the Zen like ex-Secret Service man who is reluctant to continue his assignment of protecting a pop star he has fallen in love with--\\"never get involved with the person you're protecting\\".  Now that Houston's career is on the mend, it would be great if there is a sequel. Surely the ending of this film hints at that!!
0385504225|1.0|I listened to the unabridged audio edition of this one and I was alternatively bored and disgusted by this book.  There really isn't a lot going on here. The hero spends his time chatting to various people, running around being pursued or we are forced to relive flashbacks with the crazy tattooed bad guy that I just found myself losing interest. I don't much care for crazed mentally deranged badguys, to begin with, and not only do we have to watch him, we are forced to share his POV, and learn how he came to be that way.  I could care less. I wanted to hear about the mystery and the puzzles and less about the crazy insane dude.<br /><br />I gave up sometime after the scene where Robert is nearly drowned. I found the story too dark and depressing and I just didn't find it worth the effort of listening to, to discover the ending of the mystery.

B001VPJYZK|4.0|I was wondering what the Fifth Series would be like, however it is funny and with the introduction of Evil Dave things become hilarious, yet thrillesque almost immediately.
0385504225|3.0|The Lost Symbol was not nearly as exciting or interesting as The Da Vinci Code, so for those who are reading it expecting more of the same, you will be disappointed.  The primary problem with this book, in my opinion, is that Brown tries to cram too much detail into his explanations of the various symbols, myths, etc. that he brings into the book.  The provocative parts of the book involve the characters, and the tension created when wondering what is happening to the characters and who is doing what to whom.  There are missed opportunities for even more exciting plot twists, and there were some missteps in the plot when Brown avoided having a character (or set of characters) do what would be obvious and logical in order to achieve what he wanted in his story.  Much of the book read like an extended made-for-tv movie.  A good one, but not a great one.  Also, I believe the story ended about 50 or 60 pages before Brown ended it.  I was bored and exasperated by the last few chapters, and really didn't care about what happened in Brown's ending.  Definitely a disappointment, but enough to make it worth reading.  I recommend borrowing it from a friend or the library, however. Don't spend any money on this book if you don't have to.

B001OQCV2Y|1.0|The blood-thirsty, revenge-laden, vicious, right-wing premise of \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" ignores the reality of wars, armies, and the real lives of soldiers. No soldier in any army should be scalped or dismembered merely because he is a member of any opposing army. For in a vast majority of cases he had no choice in entering that army or of wearing any particular uniform.     Therefore even American thugs, bullies, and mindless killers don't have any right to commit atrocities just because they're on the \\"right\\" side of any war, or in the \\"right\\" army. To picture our own boys and men in uniform during WWII as the monsters in this film is shameful.    The Axis side of WWII was fought by draftees into the German Army from many European countries and ethnic groups. In every country that Hitler's war machine invaded, boys and men of partly-German parentage were drafted. They had no choice of whether they would serve as German soldiers. They little choice of which service or unit in which they would serve.     Therefore, \\"Germans\\" and \\"Nazis\\", as this filmmaker uses them, were not interchangeable terms. As our war propaganda, they were understandable; but not as terms of reference in popular entertainment more than sixty years later.    Any German boy, living in Germany from 1933 to 1945, who dared to say \\"I'm not a Nazi, I'm a Christian-Democrat\\", so I shouldn't be drafted, he could be sent to prison or to a concentration camp. After the 1938 Anschluss into Vienna, if a Swiss-resident, partly-German, partly-Jewish foreign student, on being called up for military service by the German war machine, dared to say that he was both a Christian Democrat like his father, and partly Jewish, he'd have ended up in a concentration camp in Poland.     However, the German Army of WWII had a Code of Military Justice so strong that even the Nazis couldn't weaken them. It had been designed to protect German soldiers from heavy-handed abuse by non-coms and officers. That is one of the reasons why the SS was formed; to get around those rules.     Generals like Erwin Rommel were loved by their soldiers because he was strong enough to require of Hitler that the Geneva Convention, not the SS, would govern the way that his men would fight the war, at least in North Africa. Toward the end of WWII, when Hitler was losing the war, and after General Rommel had been executed, some tank and infantry units of the German Army were transferred to the SS, without the consent of their officers, non-coms, or soldiers.    So even men assigned to the SS in 1944 to 1945 weren't necessarily \\"free game\\" for Allied manhunters. To say otherwise in a modern film is a gross distortion of history.    I had a friend, a Swiss-resident German-Jewish friend drafted in 1938 after the Nazis invaded Vienna, where he was an art student.  He hid in plain sight in the German Army for six years until he was liberated in 1944 by Canadians from Quebec.     His name was William. H. \\"Lucky\\" Dingler, a multi-lingual German Army Signal Corpsman. For 21 months he was attached to the original Afrika Korps, and worked for Erwin Rommel as a proud member of the DAK.  He was brilliant; a human computer. What he saw he could draw perfectly. What he learned, what he heard, he never forgot. He kept the younger men for whom he was responsible fed and alive as much as he could.    He told me how he survived. He memorized the German Army's Military Code of Justice in boot camp. Then he accumulated medals for excellent military skills while serving with several units. A pre-war sophisticated man-about-town, during the war he consistently played the rarely-neat, partly out-of uniform, private soldier, and thus avoided any promotion to a rank higher than Staff Corporal, so that his Jewish heritage wouldn't be discovered in a background check.     When he was pressured to go to Officer's Candidate School, he deliberately committed a courts martial offense. He survived a trial in which he could have gotten the death penalty, coming out of it with three weeks of detention, delayed, because he knew the Code of Military Justice.  He had made himself too good to push around and too incorrigible to promote. (Acting this way, he won the German Iron Cross twice, the Italian Croce de Guerra, and a chest-full of campaign badges.)    He estimated that 10% of the army were snitches for the Gestapo. So to survive, and because replacements so often quickly died, he made very few friends.     In the post-war de-Nazification process carried out by the Allies, he was \\"held harmless\\"; not guilty of any blame for the war, even though he was a skillful and decorated soldier in the wrong, German army.     9,000,000 German soldiers didn't survive. Most of them were draftees, just like my friend.
B0017WCG48|1.0|In theory this is an LP done in an ideal way - half speed mastered, on quality heavy vinyl, with playback at 45rpm. How does it sound? Frankly terrible - compressed, dull, lacking dynamics, almost like a blanket is being thrown over the speaker. My CD copy sounds better.  And I see that I am not alone in feeling let down by this pressing. Surely one of the greatest metal albums of all time deserves better?

0142501123|5.0|Up until now, my favorite books to read my young child were Julia Donaldson's The Gruffalo and Karma Wilson's Bear books, and while those books are still fantastic, Room on the Broom is superb. Typically, when I read a new book, my son shows little interest, as he likes the repetition of familiarity. However, on the first run, he was captivated by this book, and so was I! So much so, that I read it immediately once more. Axel Scheffler's artwork, as usual, is vibrant and gorgeous and Donaldson's gift for rhythm and rhyme is unparalleled in my opinion (and I own hundreds of children's books). This is a great little story about mutual appreciation, and at least for now, this is number one on my son's bookshelf. If I were a writer of children's books, this would be the model I would emulate. Marvelous.
B000059TEP|4.0|Competition from the likes of Cary Grant, Robert Donat and Robert Montgomery keeps Swayze's ghost from entering the first ranks of those who have played ectoplasmic manifestations but still and all, he leads a good cast in a well-played comedy. Having no idea of what the competition was in 1990, I am puzzled but not annoyed by the Academy awards earned by Whoopi Goldberg and by the author of the screenplay. (\\"Original screenplay\\" is what it reads but there is really nothing original here; no criticism intended, traditional, can be, and is here, good for an evening's entertainment.)  Demi Moore is an appealingly androgynous partner to Swayze's physically and verbally semi-articulate lover, with Whoops Goldberg suitably energetic as the medium who bewilderingly finds herself talking to real ghosts, while Tony Goldwyn does alright as the best friend, though he might have provided a bit more romantic competition to the ghost. Most other roles were stereotypes, some well handled by talented character actors; for example; it was nice to see Phil Leeds, a fixture in TV at the time the film was shot, adding a few shots of flavoring to a bit part.  Over-all the film should please many and bore few. It provides a couple of hours of fun without significance or gritty reality.
B00003CWN3|4.0|Hillary Swank gives a stellar performance as a young adult female who attempts to live her life as a male, in this well-produced tragic independent film.  Based on the true story of \\"Brandon Teena\\" and set in Texas, this tragedy is reminiscent of Matthew Shepard's story, \\"The Laramie Project.\\"  Rated R for good reason: extreme violence, extreme language, sexual content, and nudity.

B00003CX9Q|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies in the history of cinema and one of Steven Spielberg's greatest achievements. It is truly an epic and a masterpiece that no one will ever forget. This movie has touched the world with its spectacular musical scores from John Williams and its acting performances from Drew Barrymore, Henry Thomas, Robert, Macnaughton, and Dee Wallace.  Spielberg has definitely went above and beyond with this movie. This movie is a must have for any DVD/movie collection. You cannot call your DVD/movie collection complete without it. It is one of the remarkably astounding movies that will not only touch our generation but E.T. will continue to touch the future generations to come. This movie about a boy named Elliot who makes a very special friend whom he calls E.T. will make you laugh at times and cry towards the end and will make you want to see this movie again and again. This movie will always be a movie to cherish. It is a TRUE MASTERPIECE!
B0015XHP3G|4.0|Some time has passed since Rambo was brought in from the edge by Col Trautman and we find him doing his jail sentence in a labour camp. Trautman comes to Rambo with the offer of a mission which, if successful, could bring him a pardon to go back into Vietnam for Marshall Murdock and get evidence of American POW's still being held there. When the parachute drop goes wrong Rambo finds himself behind enemy lines, betrayed by his own people but yet determined to get the POWs out. Things get worse when he finds the Russians are involved as well.  When the opening credits tell you that the film was written by Stallone and James Cameron you can't really claim that you weren't warned that the story may not be that great (although both men have some good stuff under their belts as well). True to expectations the story is pretty poor and is essentially just a series of shootouts against baddies that are really pantomime villains. Although the original Rambo didn't manage to be as interesting and insightful as it could have been, it feels like a really intelligent movie when viewed next to this movie and having Rambo deliver a pro-vet rant in the final few minutes is not any compensation and it is about as subtle as a brick. However this is not a problem if you just came to the movie looking for Rambo to shoot 'them' in big action scenes cause he does.  Sadly this 'Commando' style action has dated badly and modern audiences generally require more intelligent action (comparatively anyway); I no longer just accept the one-man against the world thing as an acceptable scenario. It still works if all you want to see if things explode and tonnes of anonymous enemies get killed however it is hard not to find it all more amusing than exciting. I thought the direction in the First Blood was OK but here George P Comatose pretty much lives up to his name and just carves out an unremarkable action movie. It's all very basic and the characters are just big cardboard cut outs in stereotypical mode hero, baddie, POW, politician etc, I didn't really care about any of them, which is a shame when you think of the aims of the original story.  Stallone is pumped up and daft at least in the first film he was more than a character but here, aside from a rant, he is just a big action man nothing more. Berkoff is a terrible ham and he is an awful bad guy here put him in a dress and he would be a pantomime dame. Napier, Wood and Crenna are all recognisable faces and add that if nothing else.  Overall this is a big dumb action movie in the style of the 80's (one man against an army) and if that's all you want then that's what you get and you'll enjoy it. However it is hard to ignore the fact that the story is poor, the action overblown, the performances weak or hammy and the 'message' reduced to a single 60 second rant by Stallone, which is obvious and crude. I enjoyed it as a stupid action movie but the sheer volume of weaknesses in this film makes it difficult to call it anything other than silly fun if you're in the mood.
B0025KVLUQ|3.0|The 2009 remaster is not worth buying unless:<br /><br />* You don't own the same album already on CD.<br />* You are an audiophile who is willing to pay big bucks for small improvements.<br />* You like collecting stuff and want the cardboard and booklets that come with the new version.<br /><br />Everyone who is saying there is a dramatic audible difference between this release and the previous CD is wrong. I'm not saying their opinion differs from mine, I'm saying they're wrong. That's a strong statement, and I'll try to back it up without getting too geeky.<br /><br />The Beatles remasters are a little louder than the 1987 CD releases. Music sounds better as it's turned up a little louder (up to the point where it starts to annoy the listener). Most people don't have a way to exactly volume-level the two releases to compare them. That's why they think the new ones are so much improved, when they're only slightly improved.<br /><br />&lt;geek mode on><br /><br />Conventional wisdom is that most people cannot detect a loudness change of less than 3 decibels. That's not quite right--most people cannot detect a volume change of less than 3dB AS A VOLUME CHANGE. They can hear the difference but they think it's something other than a difference in loudness. They think they're hearing more detail, better bass, etc.--and they are, because you can hear everything better when it's louder, and you'll like it better (up to that annoyance point).<br /><br />When you go to an audio store to buy speakers, the salesman typically has a vested interest (commission) in steering you toward a particular speaker. The unscrupulous ones will set things up so their pet speakers are 1 to 2 decibels louder than the others.  They don't push it too far, or people will detect that it's a loudness difference and ask to turn up the other speakers that the salesman wants to steer you away from.<br /><br />The differences between the old and new recordings are not large, and the new recordings certainly haven't been ruined by being made a little hotter. You can easily measure the volume differences by ripping the albums to your computer with a program that can compute replaygain values. The differences on most of the Beatles tracks are....less than 3 dB. See where I'm going with this? The new recordings are louder, but not enough louder for many people to perceive the difference as a loudness difference.<br /><br />For example, the 1987 version of Come Together from Abbey Road has a track replaygain value of -2.88. The remaster is -3.93, or 1.05 dB louder. (In the replaygain scale, things get louder as the negative numbers get bigger. Many horribly limited modern pop recordings have replaygain values of -8 or worse. Uncompressed audiophile classical recordings typically have replaygain values near zero or even a dB or two above zero.)<br /><br />I ripped the new Beatles remaster to FLAC lossless format, storing replaygain values, and compared the new recording to my 1987 CD copy through a Logitech Squeezebox with Smart Gain enabled. This means I was able to listen to the new and old recordings at the same volume level. I also played them against each other with volume leveling off, and done this way it's easy to see why most people prefer the new release.<br /><br />&lt;geek mode off><br /><br />When volume-matched, the difference between the old CDs and the new remasters is audible AND minimal. And occasional. The most obvious difference is a slightly less restricted lower end.<br /><br />We're owed better than this for all this money and hype. At the least, we should have gotten something as good as the Yellow Submarine remixes. Nobody who has heard Eleanor Rigby from that remix will ever confuse it with the original or prefer the original. Love and the Yellow Submarine remix and Let It Be Naked and the damn XBox game prove that the people who own the original tapes can do better and they know it.<br /><br />They're milking us.

B001U0HBQ0|2.0|Take a top actor like Brad Pitt and stick him in any movie and it will instantly draw attention.  This movie proves it.  The story follows the life of Benjamin from birth through death, allowing you to share all his inappropriate moments and stupid mistakes.  I personally found the concept of \\"growing young\\" rather ridiculous, and didn't find much interesting about the concept.  All of the actors gave excellent performances.  The only part of the movie I found enjoyable was actually hilarious--the shorts (pun intended) where the guy talks about being struck by lightning.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I would never have guessed it but Dan Brown has created a master-work to rival The Secret and The New Earth in it's power to open humanity up to a new level of being. As you would expect, the book is a compelling thriller with all the action and suspense you could ever want, but woven within the story is an even deeper message to the world that has the potential to bring a global shift in awareness. Unsuspecting readers will find themselves faced with somepowerful ideas that, if applied could mean a transformation of the indevidual toward peace and abundance. I know it sounds very esoteric, but the fact remains, once agian Dan Brown has challenged humanity to broaden their vision and see beyond the limited perception and beliefs to be open to a power within humanity beyond our wildest dreams. Once again, Dan Brown has created a groundbreaking work whose transformative power even he may yet be unaware.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|I have had this cd for a week now, and I play it every damn day! Hell I'm playing it now. Originally I thought it was not as good or as catchy or as good as United Abominations. I must have had a bug up my [...]. I Love this cd. Seems like Dave explores every style Megadeth has played (except for what was done on Risk). The playing of the musicians is top notch.<br /> Alot of people seem to think it is the best since Countdown to Extinction. I'm going to go and say it is the best since Rust in Peace, and maybe as close as you can get to that one. I also keep hearing/reading that this a return to form from Megadeth. I felt that way when I heard The World Needs A Hero, that album was a turning point. The System has Failed was even more classic Deth. United Abominations was awesome. This one sees Megadeth come roaring at you like some friggin weapon! Streamlined and deadly! As one reviewer has said already you can NOT listen to this without headbanging!<br /> A bit of song breakdown now:<br /><br />1. Dialectic Chaos- Dave and Chris tear it up in the instrumental opening to this opus.<br />2. This Day We Fight!- Previous track seems to bleed into this frantic, whirling track.<br />3. 44 Minutes- A winner I think for most commercial song on the cd. Very good. Call it a bit of a history lesson.<br />4. 1,320'- Very fast. It is about drag racing. Memories of So Far So Good So What come to mind.<br />5. Bite the Hand- Nice heavy riffing in a heavy song.<br />6. Bodies- The only song I don't think really works on this cd. Not bad, just not up to the rest of the songs.<br />7. Endgame- Scary apocalyptic song about a future \\"America\\". Not the easiest thing to wrap your mind around on first listen but good.<br />8. The Hardest Part of Letting Go...Sealed with a Kiss- A song only Dave could write. One of my favorites. It is not a typical ballad as the title would suggest. Do not expect Nothing Else Matters. This is twisted!<br />9. Head Crusher- Ah a medieval torture device anda kick [...] heavy song. Also the first single. Very good. It would not have been out of place on Peace Sells...<br />10. How the Story Ends- I like to think this a song about Megadeth on tour coming to wreck your town. Catchy.<br />11. The Right to go Insane- The last song here, it leaves you wanting more. It chugs along and the only shame is, it is the last song.
0307277453|3.0|This is a pretty basic book which combines paleontology, evolution and very basic genetics in a mostly narrative format. It is sadly lacking in sufficient illustration (an all too common problem these days with most popular science books) making many of the key concepts more difficult to grasp w/o prior exposure to the material. The target audience seems to be young adults or those with little biological background and it is exactly the audience that would most benefit from more illustration. However, the illustration that is present is well done but lacks adequate labeling and detailing. There simply needs to be both more illustration and better detailing/labeling of the illustration.
B002KLAL4W|1.0|This album is like a second rate version of Yeild combined with the  flop that was Riot act with a little Binaural and radio friendly elements added in to try to help this turd float.  This album is horrible.  As I said this sounds like a poor mans version of Yeild which is not that great an album to begin with.  Every song on here left me thinking WTF is this the sequel to Riot Act??  This band needs to be Pearl Jam again not Eddie and the boys.  The amazon editorial review even says \\"Eddie and the boys\\" go figure.  You can see based on Vedders solo output that this band it too over-driven by him.  Pearl Jam were pretty decent when they first came on the scene with TEN ever since then it has been one dissapointment after the next on a continuing downward spiral supported by devoted Pearl Jam junkies that will buy, praise and defend every piece of Vedder driven garbage this band will release.  Backspacer is yet again more proof of this.  It's almost a strange nostalga that your not allowed to not like Pearl Jam??  The last self titled album began showing glimmers of hope for this band but this Backspacer album is just another total let down.  Im done with Pearl Jam now that they sound like whatever is on the radio at the time the album is being recorded.  This is complete, total garbage.  As one reviewer said \\"Pearl Jam have lost it forever\\"<br /><br />This sucks, even for Pearl Jam's latter output.
B0001XAPY2|5.0|While I usually love Hayao Miyazaki's animes I put off watching Porco Rosso for years...Being from the Cincinnati area, I wasn't feeling up to another flying pig story.

0385504225|1.0|i would really like to know where Mr Brown does his research. In the Da Vinci Code he clams that the priory of sion is FACT!! Wrong Mr Brown it was made up by some French lunatic. In this novel Mr Brown wants us to believe that this noetic \\"science\\" is a \\"breakthough\\". Wrong again these ideas have been around forever there was a guy in the 60s who said he could physiclly affect plants. Also Mr Brown would have us believe that the founding fathers of this country were pagans that they bulit a shrine to the pagan gods in the US capitol. Besides the fact that ive never read this in any history book most of the founding fathers were christian. Being christian it would be scaralige to build a shrine to false gods. Again Mr Brown has written a work of complete fiction sold it as such but still manages to convice some dummies out there that what he writes is FACT!! Wish i had his abilites.
0738710261|4.0|The Mini Tarot of Marseille is a modern recreation of a wood cut tarot deck based on artwork from France during the middle ages.  The most important point for you to know about this deck is that it does not provide meaningful images for the minor arcana and uses pips instead, which is what you get on a standard deck of 52 playing cards.  I plan to use this deck while I travel so I wanted one that could double for solitare.  If you wanted to do readings with the deck, you will either need to know the meaning of the minors or consult the LWB.      This deck looks different from modern tarot decks.  The woodcut deck is less complex and uses a simple pallet on a white background for all the cards.  Primary colors; red, green, blue and yellow with brown and flesh are mostly used.  The deck looks similar in style to other European artwork from the period.  I like this deck and plan to take it with me when I travel.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I remember seeing the Beatles on the Ed Sullivan Show way back in early 1964 and thinking wow these guys are GREAT!! I was only 13 at the time but I immediately liked thier music and bought thier albums many of which I still have today. I just received the stereo cds and they sound simply AMAZING!! I would have paid twice the purchase price if necessary. I havn't listened to any of the mono cds yet but even though I personally prefer stereo over mono I'm guessing they sound wonderful as well. I think it most likely comes down to personal preference. Anyway all my other cds will most definitely have to take a back seat to these probably for quite some time(with the exception of Bruce Springsteen). If you enjoy listening to the Beatles you will not be dissapointed with this set. All I can say is this is a better sounding world because those four guys got together to form a band almost 50 years ago. Lucky Us!!
B002F6FQGK|5.0|I have to add my voice to the cacophony singing Florence + the Machine's praises.  This is an unbelievable album from a whopper of a talent. I first heard \\"Hurricane Drunk\\" on KCRW and within minutes had committed to buying the whole album. That was a month ago, and I gotta tell you, the album still hasn't gotten old despite repeated playings.<br /><br />Sure, I may be a bit obsessed. But the last time I was this excited about a new artist was when Scissor Sisters came on the scene years ago, and that's saying something.<br /><br />Key tracks:<br />- Drumming Song<br />- Hurricane Drunk<br />- Girl with One Eye

0783235607|4.0|The film begins in stark black and white, the frantic music is a clue to the story. In Phoenix Arizona Marion Crane has a long lunch hour with her boyfriend Sam. Sam has an ex-wife and financial problems. You can see a man standing in the street when Marion returns to her job in an office. Can drugs or money buy happiness? Customer Tom tells about himself. Marion must deposit $40,000 into the bank. [That would be over ten years' wages for Marion.] Will she go for a vacation? People could sleep in their cars then. Who is watching Marion? [Note the product placement in automobile brands.] A voice-over carries the story forward. After a long tiring drive she stops at a small motel. [Is the rain symbolic?]    Is motel manager Norman Bates a nice young man? What about his mother? \\"She isn't quite herself today.\\" Norman's hobby is taxidermy, the preservation of the dead (like a mummy). \\"She's as harmless as one of those stuffed birds.\\" Does this talk pad out the film or lull the viewer before an action scene? Marion takes a shower to wash away her caress. But someone else is there! The attack is done with taste. [That eye is not dilated.] Now Norman has another mess to clean up and dispose of the leftovers.    Marion's sister Lila visits Sam to inquire about her. So does a private investigator to locate the missing money. Arbogast visits hotels to search for a backtrail. One of these places is the Bates Motel. Arbogast recognizes Marion's signature, and then Norman remembers the details. Arbogast decides to go back and question Norman's mother. What a surprise! Then Sam returns to search for Arbogast. Sam and Lila visit Sheriff Chambers, who tells them about the history of Mrs. Bates. Who else was in the house?    Sam and Lila return to investigate the Bates. Did Arbogast leave after learning something? Lila slips out to see Mrs, Bates. Her elaborately decorated bedroom is empty. Norman guesses their scheme and returns to the big house. The good guys win in the end. A psychiatrist provides details to explain this story. Were there other missing persons? Does the ending now seem to be unintentionally funny?    This is a low-budget film with few actors. The story made this successful in the late 1950s. Note how Marion wears white underwear before the theft but black underwear afterwards. She was punished for her sins like in a morality play. The novel by Robert Bloch was inspired by a true crime in 1956 Wisconsin. The new highway damaged business for the Bates Motel, a reflection of the declining small businesses of the 1950s. The few outdoor scenes show southern California without traffic or smog.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I found the book to be a great read. The parts on running were useful and have already inspired me to run again. I haven't tried barefoot running but I am easing into it by running with aqua socks (I may get the FiveFingers at some point). So far so good and pain free.    The parts on evolution were informative (presuming its true which I'm trying to verify now). But common sense wise it made a lot of sense.     I just saw my doc for a physical a few days after I finished the book and told him about some of the recommendations (like running barefoot and running isnt supposed to be painful) and he mostly repeated what Mcdougall's doctor said.

0812580346|4.0|A very interesting novel, set in 2009 about a world wide black out that results in everyone Flashing forward 21 years to see a glimpse of the future.  The novel follows scientists at CERN, and is heavy with physics and cosmology explanations. It asks the question \\"is the future set or do we have free will?\\"     If you are not up on your physics, the book is still very readable and quick moving.  The author will hopefully get many people reading the novel due to interest from the tv show.  The novel is much more science-drama then police-drama (as the tv show appears to be).    The ending feels like the author ran out of things to say - and he should have just stopped.  It gets preachy and just plain silly.  Do yourself a favor and just stop about 30 pages from the end.    It is hard to say much without giving plot away, but reading the book is an enjoyable addition to being hooked on the show (although you may catch yourself telling the tv - \\"that is not how it happens!\\")  Happy Reading

B0002XH9Z4|4.0|The songs on this collection are really good.<br />Whoever put the case (container/jacket), whatever you want to call it, together did a HORRIBLE job.<br />You can almost NOT get them out. They are in there SOOO tightly, you have to be VERY careful not to crack or break them just to get them out. It is the button in the center that holds the CD that is next to impossible to get it to turn loose.<br />There is a booklet in the center that you can slide out. So what did they do? Put a CD UNDER the booklet. If you keep on taking the booklet out and putting it back,eventually you will have a marred CD.<br /> I went and bought 5(five) super cheap $3.00 CDs just to get the CD cases. I discarded the CDs and used the cases to put the CDs from \\"Ultimate Collection\\" in. Did not want to have to try to get them out again and did not want one under the booklet.<br /> If you buy this product, BE PREPARED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />ADD: There are 4(four)CDs and 1(one)DVD in this collection.<br />  The DVD is WONDERFUL!!!!!
B000UBMWG4|5.0|\\"Bladerunner\\" is a gritty, harsh, highly realistic view of a near-future world that doesn't look all that nice. It is also easily the most riveting science fiction film ever made, as well as a film noir mystery, a suspense drama, and possibly a love story. Unforgettable.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|Settlers of Catan is a highly addictive game. The robber usually prevents any one player from getting too far ahead, so no one usually loses by that much. This produces an \\"I almost had it!\\" feeling in the losers that make them instantly want to try again until they win.    For winners it is no less addictive, since the rush of winning is similar to scratching off a winning lottery ticket. There's also a feeling of \\"Well I won, but was it luck or skill?\\" which makes them want to play again to prove to themselves that it wasn't luck. Of course this is impossible really. There is no skill involved in Settler's aside from an elementary understanding of probability and the realization that the city/dev card strategy is best (one notorious strategy guide online will say differently, but as a veteran of hundreds of games I know.)    One of the negative things about the game, and why I wouldn't recommend it for kids, is that since people are competing with each other so directly through blocking with roads and the robber, and since getting blocked or robbed has such an impact, it can make people very angry and irritable with each other. I'm an emotionally mature grown man, and there have been games of Settlers that have frustrated me so much that I've went into a rage and broke things. It's also not very educational. There's nothing to be learned from this game except a simple math lesson on probability which you could teach to the average kid in ten minutes.    If you would like to play Settlers of Catan for free online against human opponents from all over the world, I've found that the best sites are [...] and w[...]. The former site is down as of this writing but should be up again soon, the later is in Dutch, but simply click on \\"Aanmelden\\" and enter your username and email to register, select \\"default official island\\" for the original game board.    Overall Settlers is a rather mindless, sometimes frustrating, but fun and addictive game. Perhaps not the greatest choice if you want something substantial or that will require a lot of intellect, but it's a classic, very well designed game for the masses that belongs in any board game enthusiasts collection.
B001IAOEXU|1.0|I have always complained about how much I hate the PS3 controller. It is small, slippery and the triggers are HORRIBLE. These add-ons change all that.. It makes the PS3 controller better but the controller should have been designed like this in the first place. The 360 controller is the best controller EVER. The design is superb and it feels great in my hands when playing with them. These add-ons are great but it doesn't solve the problems of the PS3 analog stick which I doubt an add-on can be made for them.
B0021L8US0|3.0|See this movie before you buy the DVD.  I love si-fi but was very disappointed with this.  I didn't like the jerky \\"documentary\\" style of filming.  It doesn't work as a metaphor for racial injustice because the aliens really are sub-human, and the humans aren't very bright either.  The Nigerians are cast as the bad guys who exploit the aliens, so what have we learned?  The racial angle may have more significance for South Africans, but it didn't work for me. The biggest problem with the movie was that there was no character to connect with.  The lead human character reminds me of the \\"upper class twits\\" in Monty Python sketches.  Again, South Africans may have another take on this but I don't have their context.    The movie is full of logical inconsistencies such as needing to forcable get the aliens to sign a piece of paper before moving them and the fact there there is one super smart alien (and his son).    The idea of aliens showing up and not trying to attack us is intriging, but wasted in this movie.  The only show I remember covering this subject was the movie and TV show Alien Nation.  Bits like an alien openning his door and saying that nobody is home were the best parts of the movie.  The action scenes at the end were good but it was just a shoot'em up.
B00013UTUM|4.0|its a good cd. it is somewhat different though i call it \\"my morning muse\\" it has a lot more instumental numbers then there heavier ones which i really love. but it is still very good i recommend for muse fans who just cant get enough of them, they are very talented and just great!truly talented.
B001HOF8AA|5.0|If you go to hear Imelda May perform live, she's not doing to have dancers on stage, or a head mic, and there won't be any lip synching. This is a real singer with soul, attitude, and a great band behind her. Do yourself a favor and buy this record - this is what music used to be like, back when talent, not just looks, made the difference. \\"Love Tattoo\\" is a superb record, and Imelda May deserves to be heard.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|THIS IS A MUST SEE MOVIE, IF YOU LOVE COMEDY ROMANCE. IF NOT, THEN THIS AIN'T FOR YOU!   great chemistry between all the characters, BETTY WHITE tries to steal the show, but SANDRA and RYAN win it back. This is one of those movies that you could watch over and over again. Move over TOM HANKS & MEG RYAN, we have a new couple that I would love to see make a few more movies together.
0470477237|5.0|People already using social media just recognize daily actions portraited on the book. And it has a really good analysis about the change social media has already done and will do.  Absolutely interesting the idea of keeping the book alive on a website and on twitter.
0385504225|3.0|Ok I was very exciting about this book and I purchased the day it was released. I know there are lots of die hard DB fans out there but to me this book is just not right. This book feels like as if it was written by one of those Dan Brown wannabe authors. After I had read LS I can't help but to think \\"DB just had to honer his contract with his publisher\\". Lost symbol is not a bad book but not a good one neither. Personally I was expecting a better book from DB. I'm sure there is a great work behind this book but it is not good enough for save this book.
B002FOQXZK|4.0|KiD CuDi brilliantly combined hip-hop, classical, trance n electronica and he delivers lyrics full of determination and sympathy with a lazy but very exciting flow. This record is very creative, unique and futuristic... like a hybrid of Pink Floyd, Beethoven and Kanye West.<br />\\"The sky might fall\\" but this boy has this heart of a lion that it can't stop him from flying hyeeer and landing on the moon on a pursuit of happiness.<br /><br />My top 5 (very hard to make a choice):<br />1. The Sky Might Fall<br />2. Enter Galactic -  If you can't do what you imagine then what is imagination to you?<br />3. The Soundtrack to my life<br />4. As Simple as... (leaves you expecting another verse in vain)<br />5. My World / In my Dreams<br /><br />I think he really thought outside the box and I applaud him because few artists can craft such a risky concept especially for a debut album. Hope he keeps innovating his music once he's done exploring the moon and comes back to planet earth... For now PRESS Enter Galactic and fly Hyeeer
B001LL9YP4|4.0|This is an entertaining movie with good cast and a fine score by Bruce Broughton.  This \\"I love the 80s\\" DVD claims that the film is presented in widescreen and enhanced for 16:9 TVs; however, the 2.35:1 film is NOT enhanced for widescreen TVs.  The picture and sound are clear, though.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|I'm not a hard core fan of ST or the genre, and would never have seen it excpet that I was on a long flight and it was available. Good action film, and exceptionally good casting of the younger versions of the classic characters. Lots of humor in the script, though nothing that takes away from the action or the \\"seriousness\\" of the original series. Well done and fun to watch.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read.  It moves well, it is suspenseful, it keeps you guessing.  You will not be disappointed.
0525951113|5.0|I had to fly for about eight hours, so in self-defense I grabbed a book to read in event I got tired of listening to my iPod.  It was a good choice.<br /><br />After getting settled I pulled this book out and started reading.  I literally read it one one marathon sitting!  It was rivetting!<br /><br />The story describes an entirely plausible and frightening series events set around an online first person shooter game crossing into real life.  The main character, a game company owner, creates a \\"DAEMON\\" that tracks users, reads newspapers, enlists the help of the disenfranchised, and seeks to overturn civilization as we know it.  The pace is fast, the twists frequent and challenging to decode.  I truly lost myself reading this story.<br /><br />Perhaps it's so compelling to me because of my real-life work that takes me into this realm to begin with.  Maybe it's because I can understand the technology discussed in the story well enough to know that the general concept is realistic - which makes it even more frightening.  The machinery in the story is a little bit over the top but it still holds together very well and made me stop and think about how secure our computer systems really might not be, after all.<br /><br />If you workin the computer business and think that online security is someone elses problem, this book will give you a wake up call!<br /><br />Go ahead and turn your firewall, intrusion protection, spam filter off!  I guarantee you'll run your virus checker twice after reading this!
0385504225|5.0|Sorry for all the negative reviews!! I couldn't stop turning the pages, and had NO earthly idea who the villian was from the outset, as some reviewers claimed. You should DEFINITELY read this book!
B001AVCFJM|5.0|Saw new ST09 3 times! Loved every minute of it! Been a Trek fan since I was 11 & saw 1st episode in the '60's. Of all the Trek movies, this one is absolutely the best!!!  Loved all the new characters. Still love the old ones too, but am so glad to see Star Trek resurrected - can't wait to get the movie! :)
037571457X|5.0|You do not know how much I enjoyed reading this graphic novel!  The literary and artistic elements that attribute to the story are extraordinary!  I LOVE young Marjane because she is so cute and she has a lot of attitude.  She doesn't really take garbage from anyone.  She's even cuter in the movie!!!
B001AVCFK6|5.0|As an orginal Trekkie, this is the BEST ST movie ever made!! Wow!! JJ Abrams nailed all the characters - my faves: all of them!!!  Couldn't belive my eyes - thank God someone finally resurrected my favorite show! Can't wait to get the movie and see the sequels! :)
B0017HEYEI|1.0|I got this video for my daughter thinking it would be in English. Everything on the box but the movie title is written in Korean!

0061537969|5.0|This story really moved me as a dog lover and a human being. And this book's ending is one of the best and most satisfying that I can remember. I loved the characters and Garth Steins gentle unfolding of the story. I recommend this book to anyone. It's a great dog story and a great story, period. It's a fast read. I wish I'd have read it slower, and relished it longer. But I couldn't put it down!
1596680296|5.0|I never thought that I would be able to knit socks.  Patterns just seemed too complicated.  I was thrilled to find this book and it started me on an obsession with sock knitting.  This is wonderful for beginners and I think that I will be using this as reference for a long time to come.  The explanation and illustration of the kitchener graft was especially helpful.      As to the reviewer who gave this book one star, I feel that it was an unfair judgement.  For an experienced sock knitter, maybe this book won't be so helpful.  But for the new, inexperienced sock knitter, this is a wonderful teaching book and reference, delivering 100% on what the title states--\\"GETTING STARTED\\" Knitting Socks.
1402532903|4.0|My purchase got to me quickly and was exactly what I had expected, good shape. Would definitely buy from this person again.
0385504225|5.0|I will say that when I first found out that the Lost Symbol was to be coming out I became a little nervous due to the fact that I love Dan Brown's books. I was worried because the setting was different it isn't placed in Europe, and also the idea of Free Masonary to me sounded almost boring.    This book when I finished it exceeded any expectations I had for it. Flat out getting to the point I loved it so much. While its true the plot twist at the end was somewhat obvious if you read the book and paid attention, the book itself contained historical evidence and true logic like other Dan Brown books this one might be tested as false.     For me after reading this book through twice and loving it more the second time I've concluded these three things:    1. Dan Brown is one of the best authors I've ever come by  2. This book is intelligent and witty... just the way I like it.  3. In my opinion the order of amazingness of the Robert Langdon adventures goes as follows:         3. Da Vinchi Code         2. The Lost Symbol          1. Angels and Demons.    This book is no Angels and Demons but it cuts it pretty close. All in all, I say Dan Brown has hit another home run with this book.
B001PJRAUS|2.0|It was with a bit of trepidation that I decided to watch this movie. I figured it was likely to be stupid, but I was in the mood for a bit of mindless fun, so I went with it.  Don't get me wrong, there is mindless fun to be had - but this film has no artistic merit whatsoever (which must be why so many people seem to love it).    At the start, I thought it might be okay - I mean, here's this girl Amanda, her favorite book is Pride and Prejudice, she's disappointed with modern life, and she gets a chance to go back in time and see what life was really like - not her romantic idealization of the whole Elizabeth-Darcy courtship.  She goes back and finds out that society was very rigid, restrictive, there were a lot of rules to follow and you couldn't even get a decent toothbrush!  Right up till about the point when Darcy tells Amanda he could never marry her, I felt like the film had some integrity - even if some of the liberties taken with the characters and their conversations were incongruous with the times in which they were set.  But then after that, consumed with the need to give everyone a happy ending, the plot becomes so ridiculous and contrived - as well as stretching the characters past recognition - that it is impossible to have any respect for the film or take any pleasure in the outcome for the characters.  All we Austen fans love Pride and Prejudice - I've read it a number of times, and the love story is always satisfying. But the truth is, Jane Austen wrote that book for the same reason so many novels get written: to create a world the way it should be, rather than the way it is. In real life, Darcy likely would not have married Elizabeth, even if he wanted to, for just the reasons stated clearly by him in the book. After all, Jane could not marry the man she loved because she lacked a fortune.  And even if Darcy and Elizabeth had married, there's no proof that they would have been as happy as Austen tells us they intend to be.  Women tended to have baby after baby, not a lot of freedom, and in Elizabeth's world, despite the money and status, quite a lot of tedious obligations to fulfill as part of her role.  I think a movie about a modern woman coming to realize just how unromantic the Regency period really was would have been far more compelling. Sure, the clothes were pretty - and the English countryside ravishing, but really, what modern woman would actually choose to live in a world where she had few rights or choices, marriage was a mercenary undertaking and she was entirely dependant on a husband or father for her support?  But I digress.  About the only character I thought was materially improved was Wickham. Am I the only one who's ever thought Austen was a little too harsh on him for enjoying having sex with women? Oh, I know, it was a different time and place, and the indulgence of a man's pleasure could ruin a woman, both financially and socially. So a man who toyed with women that was WAS truly a cad - but again, it comes back to the advantages of living in modern times, when sex and sexuality are more free and open - so it fits with the thesis of disillusionment with Austen romances...    And really, doesn't it strike anyone else as a little disappointing, that our heroine, who is trying to make right what she has screwed up, makes her promise to Lady Catherine, then runs back to Darcy?  It takes a little of the pleasure out of the moment to think that now Jane gets to stay stuck in her marriage to the hideous Mr. Collins.  I guess when it comes right down to it, I'm not really equipped for mindless fun - which this totally is. If you don't think about any of what it means and aren't bothered by a plot and characters that don't stay true to themselves - even as reinvented here - then I think you will enjoy this film.
B00004U28G|5.0|I first saw this movie as a kid. A very good choice for any young boy, funny, exciting and most of all a classic! You never see movies like this no more.
B000093BDX|5.0|This is a very nice looking and very high quality Beach Boy album. It has all my favorite songs by them which sound great! California Girls, I Get around and Don't Worry Baby to name a few. There are only a few mono songs. There are thirty songs on the album. This is a great deal!
B0011TQLA2|5.0|This review is going to be short sweet, and to the point.    This was the first Radiohead album I have ever heard.     At first, I hated every second of it.    Now, it is one of my favorite albums of all time.    I can't see why it is only getting four stars.    It is far better than OK Computer.    It is worth the purchase.    Although it may take some time, don't expect to enjoy it initially.    After all, it took me about a year or so to even like one or two songs.    This album deserves five stars, it is unarguably one of Radiohead's top 3 best albums.      If you like this, there is also a free downloadable single off there website,     [...]    It is called These Are My Twisted Words.
B000VLE3GA|5.0|This two disc Led Zeppelin set is awesome! It has all my favorite songs by the group. The songs sound WAY better than my old cd single albums. It is a very high quality album from one of the greatest groups of that time! Buy it if you like Led Zeppelin!

0307341569|4.0|With \\"Dark Places\\" Gillian Flynn has created a novel with such a powerful ending that the reader will want to reread the book immediately.<br /><br />Libby Day is age 7 when her mother and two sisters are massacred. She is the witness against her brother, Ben, testifying that he is the killer.<br /><br />Now, twenty-five years go by and she is running out of money. She is contacted by the Kill Club, a group of crime solving wannabees. They feel that Ben has been wrongly jailed. Libby agrees to meet with them and for a fee will look into the deaths of her family and report back to the club.<br /><br />From this point on, the story uses alternating chapters as seeing what Libby is doing with her investigation and flash backs to see what the family was going through at the time of the murders. We learn that Patty Day, Libby's mother was having a hard time raising four children by herself. She was also afraid that she would lose the farm to forclosure. Ben was a fifteen year old, lonely teenager. He didn't have many friends and turns to Devil worship and drugs. He has a meddling sister, Michelle, who taunted him.<br /><br />As Libby gets closer to the answers of what happened that night, she is suddenly cast back to the same position she was in twenty five years ago, running for her life from a killer who wants to make her a final victim.<br /><br />There is power and uniqueness to this story. Libby is a dark, yet interesting character. She is flawed but brave and determined to find the answers to what happened to her family. The pace of the story is well conceived as if it had a heartbeat that sped up as the story draws to a conclusion with the reader moving to the edge of their seat to see what happens to Libby.<br /><br />The author, Gillian Flynn, has been nominated for an Edgar award for her novel, \\"Sharp Objects\\" which won two British Daggers. Movie rights to that novel have been sold and the author is working on the screen adaptation.

B001AQTWF2|4.0|It's really good to see Whitney Houston back doing what she does best. I think that more than anything is why I'm rating this 4 stars. This album as a whole wasn't amazing, or 100% solid...but the songs that were good were REALLY good. I'm really surprised \\"Million Dollar Bill\\" isn't doing better on the charts than it is. That song is a definite smash. Easily the strongest vocal performance and definitely the most fun out of all the tracks. \\"I Look To You\\" is a solid ballad. If you're used to old Whitney, you'll notice that she sings a lot lower on the whole. The way this song was written compliments her current vocal delivery. \\"Worth It\\" is an amazing love anthem. I've got to say this one track that will be replayed over and over for a while on my mp3 player. \\"For the Lovers\\" is an up-tempo club vibe track. It's a lot of fun and is really energetic. \\"Salute\\" is the last song worth mentioning on here, as it has a definite 'let me shake all my haters off, whether they be wrong doing men or critics' vibe, and at the same time has a memorable hook. so 5 out of 11 for me. The other songs weren't bad, but they weren't really stand out either. \\"A Song For You\\" was a decent cover of the Leon Russell hit we're all familiar with with a techno twist...but I would've appreciated another original song. Overall the vocals are still good, if a bit different, and there are some very solid songs on here. Definitely worth picking up.
B00275EHCI|4.0|\\"Surrogates,\\" a science fiction film based on a series of graphic novels, is an interesting take on a future where humans could have robotic counterparts, called surrogates, who live life on behalf of their human counterparts. Surrogates are controlled by the humans they represent, and are usually younger and better looking than the humans they represent. Bruce Willis plays a policeman who has not been out in public for years since the death of his young son. His wife, played by Rosamund Pike, is also housebound, and has very little contact with Willis.<br /><br />When the son of the creator of surrogates is killed, it sets off a chain of events that causes Willis to go out into the world again to solve a deepening mystery that involves the corporation that creates most of the surrogates, the creator of the surrogates, who has turned against surrogacy, and the leader of the anti-surrogacy movement, played by Ving Rhames.<br /><br />The movie is intelligent, well-acted, and thought provoking. The end solves lots of problems, but also leaves lots of questions that shouldn't have to be asked. It is an entertaining film, but it could have been better without the plot issues.

B001NESPHC|5.0|\\"My One and Only Thrill\\" is one of the best jazz records ever. It definitely positions Melody Gardot as one the of the preiminent jazz artists of this or any generation.<br /><br />The only cover on this record is \\"Over The Record,\\" and even it seems fresh and reinvigorated, even though it is relentlessly covered by jazz musicians. But it is the other songs, all written by Gardot, showing a range of tenderness, bitterness, and unrestrained, unvarnished romanticism and guided by her beautiful, emotional voice, that set this record above all the rest. Songs like \\"Baby, I'm A Fool,\\" \\"If The Stars Were Mine,\\" \\"Our Love Is Easy,\\" \\"The Rain,\\" and every other cut on this record show an artist who can convey feelings and emotions with the greatest of recording artists.<br /><br />My One and Only Thrill is an absolute must for any jazz music lover, and actually, a must for any music lover regardless of genre.
0385504225|3.0|Dan Brown may not be the world's greatest writer but he does tell a good story. He gives you information, twists and turns, a character you like and usually an interesting search. Unfortunately, the search is not that interesting. When Langdon finally finds what he's been looking for, you really don't care. In \\"DaVinci Code\\", the idea behind the search was interesting and ignited your imagination. Unfortunately, my imagination was not ignited in this book. I knew the bad guy's identity half-way through which is not a great sign.  Still, it was an entertaining read but not one I would pass on to my friends and say, \\"You really have to read this.\\"

1594488916|5.0|Never before did I know the extent to which the antique/rare book world could come under threat by thieves. Oh, don't get me wrong, I know that the Gutenberg Bible is worth a fortune, and that some other rare documents have quite a lot of value; the theft of such items doesn't surprise me. But what does surprise me, and what was adeptly touched on in Bartlett's journalistic monstrosity, is the extent to which people will go to collect even less-valuable items.    The Man Who Loved Books Too Much is about such a person--John Charles Gilkey. Bartlett takes a winding journey through collectors' and book lovers' obsessions and follows the trail of Gilkey, a notorious book thief, across the country to the various individuals once targeted by the book obsessed man. One central figure is Ken Sanders, who takes on the role of book detective to hunt down Gilkey (previously unknown), and to retrieve the stolen items to return them to their rightful owners. Bartlett follows the trail, putting together the pieces, digging into the mind of the book obsessed and, ultimately, the mind of Gilkey, to put together a book as addictive as its key characters.    I mean that too. When I started reading this over a week ago I found myself swept into the astonishingly detailed, richly researched world that Bartlett was trying to recreate. The rare book sellers, buyers, collectors, and even the thieves: all of them kept me fascinated with the world they inhabit, yearning to know more. Bartlett's novel, thus, became a journey that I was eager to complete and yet terrified to see go. The book is too short for its own good (about 260 pages, plus footnotes), but thoroughly enjoyable.    It's hard to go into any more detail here without spoiling the novel. The back cover pretty much says everything I've said here, but you really need to pick this one up, particularly if you love books as much as I do. Bartlett's novel, while not fiction, is one of those books that all fiction lovers should read.It takes on the book we so love and puts its history into a new context; it makes the world we enjoy drastically more complex by expanding its history, by dreaming up from the den of facts the reality that the book world is not just a place of words and authors, but so much more. Maybe we already knew that, but now we have proof. Now, we can point and say, \\"See, books aren't so boring, now are they?\\"    P.S.: Books aren't boring, at least not to me. I was simply illustrating a point that many people think they are.
0385504225|2.0|I agree with many other readers that this book was a major disappointment.  While Brown's plots were never meant to be entirely realistic, this one seems over the top.  As usual in his books, the fleshing out of the characters just isn't there.  What kind of a guy is Robert Langdon?  We know what he does for a living but little about him as a person. But much of the book was just plain boring - too much time spent on technical details of Noetics, etc.  I did enjoy learning more about the Masons and he did cause me to read up on them online.  But the \\"explanation\\" of the Lost Word was just plain silly and not believable.  And his pontificating on the nature of man, religion and the meaning of it all was an exercise in personal indulgence.
0385504225|1.0|It's amazing to me that it's necessary for Dan Brown to continuously and insidiously find every excuse to ridicule and belittle Christianity and Faith.  The overt theme in this book was how nothing in the Bible is true. That all the biblical writings originated with mystical, ancient 'masters' who found enlightenment void of God and that anyone of individual faith, be it Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism et al. are sorely unenlightened.  Troubling indeed because he's a talented writer and has quite the following.  The book itself is a rehash of all his other novels.  Same premise, outline, theme and formula.  Some of his early works are well done but as of late, he seems to have turned into the proverbial 'dog with a bone' and he isn't letting go any time soon.  Pass on this one...

The character of Salander is wonderfully written and she never bores you.  The plot was excellent and we learned more about Salander and her history.  I wish we knew more about Blomkvist - he is a complex character but not yet fully fleshed out for me.  I am so very sorry that this wonderful writer died and that we only have one more book in this series to enjoy when it is released
0385504225|4.0|In \\"The Lost Symbol\\" Dan Brown sticks to what has worked for him in the past.  The book includes the requisite secret society, evil villain, and other assorted characters and leaves you guessing as to what that exact role of each is until the very end.  The action is very fast paced and jumps quickly from scene to scene as in Brown's previous entries.    I enjoyed the book even though there were parts that certainly left me shaking my head.  The whole noetic science thing was a bit out there for my liking but the book remained a page turner nonetheless.  The bottom line is that if you enjoyed \\"Angels & Demons\\" and \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" that you will likely enjoy this book as well.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|Simultaneously energetic and world-weary, The Strokes' third effort adopts a cynical perspective without dismissing the catchy, upbeat fundamentals that make for easy listening. The album clocks in at a lengthy 52 minutes, a considerable expansion from the band's previous productions, each lasting just over half an hour. In spite of this, at no point does the album feel overdone or longer than necessary; in fact, after my first listen I still found myself wanting more.<br /><br />I would heartily recommend First Impressions to long-time fans and first-timers alike. It is easily one of my top five music purchases in recent memory.
1601251505|3.0|I bought pathfinder because I couldn't stand to not get my hands on it after reading about it. My group exclusively plays 3.5 so I figured I'd check it out. For the most part, I do like it. But I think that's attributed to my beginnings and long-standings with 3.5, it's something I'm use to. Pathfinder doesn't change much, but what it does is throw in new abilities and a couple new mechanics for play. As previously stated, there are no more dead levels and this is in effect to make all classes feel 'full' and encourages players to stick with their class, instead of multi-classing at dead levels. At a glance, all of the classes feel stronger but Paladins, Fighters, and Rangers are most built on, I think. Paladins can really crush evil now, and fighters excel at what they do more than before (although they're still rather limited to what they can do).<br /><br />I like the concept of Combat maneuvers in PF but I don't think the numbers add up fairly in certain situations. I think in Pathfinder your player characters are going to have a more difficult time pulling off combat maneuvers unless they take feats like improved grapple and the like, because by my calculations some monsters are going to be near impossible to perform maneuvers on.<br /><br />The main gripe I have with pathfinder is that it didn't really do anything to make spellcasters more balanced with the other, martial classes. Casters still have an undeniable edge over these characters. Another gripe I have is that in my opinion the designers really just regurgitated 3.5 into a new book without changing much of the main issues 3.5 had at all (CoDzilla, spellcasters > martial characters, DM prep time, too much number crunching and accouting, high level play issues, etc.). The main argument is that that's what the point of pathfinder is, that it is supposed to be 3.75. To me it really feels like 3.55, or 3.6. They could have changed a lot more things for the better while still keeping it 3.5, but they didn't.<br /><br />The design & artwork is amazing. And for a lot of people, this kind of thing makes PF look extremely appealing. It is a beautiful book, and I believe this is vital, because if you strip that away it really does just look like 3.5 with some pretty houserules sprinkled on top.<br /><br />My group is so used to 3.5 that pathfinder does work for us. My 3 star rating doesn't reflect the system entirely, rather the potential things left out that could have made it into the PF book that I think could have really made it way more appealing than it is.gn & artwork is amazing.

B000PFU7OO|5.0|I love love love this movie and I love love love the music. It is one of my top favorite movies for so many reasons, one of them obviously being the music.    Glen Hansard's voice is so full-bodied and powerful. It really complements and contrasts well with Marketa Irglova's haunting (in a good way) voice. All of Marketa's emotions lay just below the surface of her voice when she sings. She doesn't just flat out give you all the emotion. She gives just enough and makes you, as the listener, work/feel for the rest and I love this. I love that the complete package of emotion in her songs involve the listener actually feeling the song, linking the lyrics, tempo, melody, etc. all together. I really don't know how to explain it very well and I'm sure I just confused everyone. One last try: It's like Marketa gives just enough emotion in her singing, not giving it all away for free, and leaves the listener salivating for just a tiny bit more, in a good way. And to me, this is perfect.    All of the songs on this album are truly amazing. If I had to choose a favorite, it would be the song from scene at night where Glen first meets Marketa, Say It To Me Now, simply because it is so powerful. When I first saw it in the movie, it left me speechless. That scene between Glen and Marketa marked the point when I knew this movie would make it into my top favorite movies of all time.     So a little bit of background on me. To me, life would not be life without music. I write and produce music of similar style (powerful, climatic, sometimes haunting), so I really relate to Once.     The emotions of the music (and movie) is really what draws me in. If you love powerful music this is for you.
B00007KQKM|5.0|A very good job Ken Russell did by adapting another novel of D H Lawrence. Not only did he directed and co-wrote an adaptation from a very controversial novel who exists in three different versions, though the third is the most common in bookstores, Ken Russell combined elements from the second and from the third version, mixing together only the best elements and keeping the same story together. Like he says in the interview on the dvd, he tried to remain in the spirit of the novel.<br /><br />Great compliments go to all the actors, including Joely Richardson and Sean Bean, whose chemistry is perfect. Thanks to that, it makes the relationship between all characters believable.<br /><br />Though the music soundtrack is not the same as the one used during the original broadcasts, apart from the diegetic music played on the piano or on the saxophone by the characters, I found the public-domain music used on the dvd very good. Though it would have been nice to know from Ken Russell in his interview which english composers he used for his original broadcast.<br /><br />Anyway, an excellent tv series to watch.
1905654294|1.0|I read the first book after I saw the movie, because everybody was telling me that the Twilight book was so much better and yes indee I felt for it and like everybody else I have to read the other 3 books. But starting with New Moon the magic of twilight become to fade; in the first one, Bella was a shy, caring and descreet girl who can keep a secret but in new Moon SM transform her into a girl who can keep her mouth shut, she tell everything even the more private thing, she told all her beloved vampire family secrets to their archi-enemy-love of her heart-best friend Jacob Black.She change from being a caring girl who even risk her own life for the sake of his parents to be a selfish-reckles girl who wants to be in risk all the time because she wanst to hear Edward's voice, but even in this book their love was almost intact so I kept my hopes up and read the next one \\"Eclipse\\". and what did I found? that SM transform the selfish girl into a monster: she loved Edward, she love Jacob, she wants to make love with Edward, she kiss Jacob, she didn't want Edward to go to the fight but she wants Jacob at her side too and then she wants Edward to make her forget Jacob and almost throw out her broken heart crying all night (in Edward presence by the way) because she only can be with only one man. Who is this girl, maybe the lukiest girl in the world.  But what about our beautifull, protective, jealouse , beloved vampire Edward, he become a temple of patience, serenity and forgiveness, I wanted to slap him to get some real reaction from him. Then here it comes BREAKING DAWN a pain in my heart, what we get from this books of shadows: Bella and Edward's wedding at last, but wait,I know nothing about the wedding because there is not description in the book about it, no Bella's wedding dress or Edward's suite, Alice effort for the wedding decoration NOTHING!!! oh! yea, sorry, it was the most beautifull wedding anyone ever had!!Wedding night what we got, not even a kiss, from \\"webelong together and forever\\" to the morning after with Bella's body full of bruises but complete sastisfy and in a cloud of hapinnes, and then the pregnancy thing what a joke.  And here it comes the pain in my heart Jacob-Pedophilo-Black, Stefany Meyer couldn't find the words to describe a beatifull night between two young lovers but pedophillia is not problem for her. SM couldn't find a women in the whole serie to make this Jacob Black forget about Bella, except her new born baby child RENESSME!! with this pedophillia-imprinting story, I felt so sad went a read this, Jacob Black change from: being crazy in love with Bella and hate the Bloodsucker Edward with all his heart to be their future son in law, EXCUSE ME!!! what a sad book; and then everything was about Renessme and how Bella has become the most powerfull vampire in the history of vamps!! Sorry to tell but there is no magic in this book, not beautifull fellings just sadness, next time I stick with the movies!!!
B002KVSJ7S|5.0|Love MIKA, this CD is fantastic.  Favorite selections are Blame It On The Girl, Rain, I See You and Blue Eyes.  Actually, there isn't a bad song on the entire CD.  What fun it is in the car and by the pool.  I loved Life In Cartoon Motion, it was a brilliant debut and this is fantastic also.  BUT..... I am ready for a more mature and grown up CD the next time around.  I understand the old saying, \\"If it ain't broken, don't fix it\\".  That's all well and good for two CD's but I think it might be a tired formula the next time around.  This man is incredible and I'm sure there is more up his sleeve than he is letting on.  Watch the documentary that is included in the deluxe set.  This is an intelligent  man who knows exactly what he is doing.  Let's hope the next time around he decides to go with a more grown up sound and really give us something that will be astounding.  He's got the CHOPS to do anything he sets his mind to.  I can't say enough good things about this guy.  This CD is like no other out there and he deserves all the praise and awards that should come his way.  Watch out Grammy Awards, he has the capability to win them all.  This is someone who would be amazing to see in concert, I hope he goes on the road and tours the States, I'll be first in line.  He truly is \\"The Boy Who Knew Too Much\\", let's hope he knows lots more.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|I immediatley got into Taylor Swift's music after hearing her first song \\"Tim Mcgraw\\" on the radio. I tried so much to find out who the artist was and then I saw the video on CMT. I knew I had to get her first album when it came out. I found every song on that cd so wonderful, having a story and enjoyable.     I then was really anticipating for this cd to come out. When I got it right away and listened to it did I find out that it was just as good as her first album. Every single song was so good that I listened to the album all the way through without skipping a song. Every song on the album is my favorite and I enjoy the all the videos of the songs they made so far! She is one of my favorite female musicians. This cd is defintely worth picking up.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|This is probably the best Harry Potter movie that has been made so far. Even at the beginning of the movie, I was impressed with the graphics and flow. Having read the series, I felt that some of the previous installations did not properly convey the storyline the way that this one did making it very easy to follow for someone who has not read the books. In general, I found the movie thrilling and suspenseful, the characters easy to care for and an overall success. There were a few points left out which is forgivable due to time constraints as it is already quite a long movie. The only thing that I would have changed is that about half way through the movie, there is a strange scene that was an addition from the book. I won't go into detail as I don't want to ruin it but it seemed unnecessary and also could prevent important events from occurring (or at the very least change them) in the movies to follow. All in all, it's definitely worth watching for even the most casual of HP fans.
1582701709|4.0|Very uplifting and inspirational in it's presentation and packaging, but this information is nothing new. The idea of using visualization, affirmations, good attitude, etc. to transform your life is a very old idea and a most popular strategy in many self-help books. None the less, I still enjoy revisiting these ideas and they have already impacted on my current life and outlook.<br /><br />I see the idea (or secret) as it was presented very useful on two levels. If you change your outlook to one of optimism and certainty, you will begin to see and act on opportunities (connected to your goals) that are all around you. People will also begin to respond to you in a more favorable mode as well. Some of the latest mind/brain research shows that much (or most) of the actions we take are below our conscious level (within our unconscious brain.) So through visualization and believing something we want already exists we set the direction of our unconscious mind. That mind then begins to take action (effortlessly) to bring reality into existence.<br /><br />What is not provable (or is a conjecture) in the book is the idea that the universe is personal and your thoughts are the key ingredient that affects (or attracts the changes in your life.) There is a bit of talk about quantum physics in the book and if you subscribe to the mulit-verse model of the quantum universe (our realities are forever splitting into alternate universes) then perhaps our consciousness flows to universes that favor the outcomes we believe are real.<br /><br />I took this book in via audio as I took my morning walks you might consider this mode.
0812971825|1.0|Interesting characters, authentic settings, a plot based on characters' ' reactions to each other and their circumstances, and a hope for some sort of redemption at the end.  What more could a reader ask?  I truly enjoyed this and Elizabeth Strout's other two books.

0307454541|5.0|A bestseller, of course, and a must-read for many apparently, well-deserved and -rewarded for both author (or his family, now, anyway) and reader, and what a ride in this entrancing thriller about a social misfit, a twenty-something female computer savant who investigates and exposes the dirty secrets of a corporate family dynasty, with all, of course, within the context of the inevitable male midlife crisis.  Is every male writer of literary fiction cuckholded, divorced, estranged or impossibly conflicted?  Or are those just the writers I prefer?  There are so many elements (and so many reviews), it's pointless now other than to recommend this novel, which expresses such intricacy, inventiveness and drive, along with steamy sex and violence much or most against both natural law and statute.  What a shame that this great story-teller has passed.  One can see that he wasn't quite finished with the compelling sequel, The Girl Who Played With Fire.  What great love and sympathy this writer had for his heroine, such that he could never let her go!  Indeed, they departed the literary world together.
1601251505|5.0|I purchased Pathfinder core rulebook a few weeks ago and I will try to answer to the questions I was asking myself before ordering and getting the book in my hands.<br /><br />Am I satisfied by the orientation taken by D&D 4th edition to continue to play with my friends?<br />Answer is NO, I really enjoyed playing D&D 3.5 and I consider that D&D 4 doesn't allow us to personnalise our characters the way we like, moreso we enjoy the drama and the roleplay more than a naive epic style or a succession of confrontations and therefore the new edition of D&D doesn't fit us.<br /><br />Why purchasing Pathfinder if I already have D&D 3.5?<br />First, I consider Pathfinder as an improvement, a \\"wise player feedback\\" to D&D 3.5. An upgrade that can be compared to the changes offered by D&D 3.5 compared to D&D 3.<br />Second as Wizard of the Coast terminated all products and licensed products under the D&D 3.5 game system, therefore the only way to keep it alive is to support an editor whose gaming values are close to mine.<br /><br />Will it be as professional (structured and nice) as the products of Wizard of the Coast?<br />Definitly YES, all the changes brought to the races and classes are smart, wise and balanced. If you loved a specific race or class you will enjoy the new options or possibilities given.<br />About the presentation the Pathfinder corebook is just splendid, quality of paper is good.<br /><br />How compatible is it with the books I already have (from D&D3/3.5 or open licence products)? Isn't it too much linked to Pathfinder other products?<br />Just a perfect compatibility as the names of races, classes, skills, spells and feats remain almost exactly the same and the logic of D&D 3.5 is preserved.<br />The other Pathfinder products/universe are almost not mentionned in the book.<br /><br />Nothing is perfect, so where is the flaw?<br />There is no real flaw in the Pathfinder corebook but it seems that Paizo tried to combine inside the same book both the equivalent of a Player's Handbook and a Gamemaster's Handbook. The result is an almost 500 pages book, it's big, very big and therefore a bit heavy. Even so it's obvious that it wasn't possible to deal with everything and prestige classes suffered a bit from the restriction (I was a bit disapointed not to find the Blackguard among them).<br />There is nothing about the psionics nor the new classes and races developped over the numerous D&D supplements.<br /><br />Does Pathfinder deserve a 5?<br />YES, I really thing this product deserves 5 stars. I'm playing D&D for 25 years and therefore used D&D Basic set, AD&D 1st and 2nd edition, D&D 3rd and 3.5 and I even purchased D&D 4th edition and I can guaranty you that Pathfinder core rulebook is nothing but excellent.s an almost 500 pages book, it's big, very big and therefore a bit heavy.

0061719544|5.0|I've been a longtime fan of Craig Ferguson since his days on The Drew Carey Show.  I loved his first book Between The Bridge And The River, and his latest is no exception.  It is brilliantly written, jaw-dropping at times, fabulously funny, sad and up-lifting without any of the gagging sweetness involved.  I have even more respect for him than ever.  I laughed a lot, get teary-eyed at some parts of the book.  A great roller-coaster of a ride of emotions for me.  I highly recommend this book.

0375703764|5.0|I finished this book last year and still think of it occasionally.  This story has so many sub-plots going, you can't put the book down - the page number seems daunting, but I finished this rather quickly, both at home at work, due to crazy editing.  This was one of the best-written books I have ever read.  Give it a try!
B00002E224|5.0|The simplest of all movie stories: boy meets girl. And it's done pretty simply in this incredibly affecting and joyous celebration of young love; but simple, in this case, is a pathway to greatness. Simple, in this case, means intense, focused, and rapturous.<br /><br />Celine (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) are on a train, sitting in the same car a few rows apart. Celine is reading book in French and Ethan an English-language one; they each gaze out at the passing countryside occasionally. A couple near Celine start arguing loudly in German; she moves and sits down near Jesse. A halting conversation starts up but quickly becomes comfortable as Jesse learns that Celine's English is near-perfect, and that each is alone. They have dinner in the dining car and engage in small talk and learn a little about each other: Celine is on her way back from Budapest to Paris where she's going to school; Jesse is on his way to Vienna to fly back to the USA after bumming around the continent for a couple of weeks. They both seem by turns shy and aggressive...the train pulls in to the Vienna station, and Jesse impulsively asks Celine to get off with him and spend the evening wandering around the city, as he doesn't have the money for a hotel room. After a little hesitation, she accepts.<br /><br />I don't know if Linklater or his lead actors/co-writers Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy were familiar with Jacques Rivette's 1974 CELINE AND JULIE GO BOATING or not; I suspect that the director at least was. Like Rivette's film (the first half hour in particular), this is about two people wandering around a big and beautiful city, getting to know each other, and going off in unexpected directions, and like the earlier film this was co-written by the cast and heavily improvised. The obvious similarities pretty much end there - Rivette's film develops into a relatively humorous and fanciful murder-mystery, its two female leads never developing a romantic relationship; BEFORE SUNRISE is a quite serious (though never \\"heavy\\") romance and the male/female dynamic is always in play. But the two also have in common a love of the city and of exploration, a sense of the city as adult playground that is surprisingly not all that common in cinema - at least not in our suburban world today.<br /><br />I don't mean to suggest that this film is burdened with heavy European art-film tropes or that it is lacking in originality - far from it in fact. For a film with such a simple storyline and some obvious points of reference both French and American (think several Judy Garland romances from the 40s in particular) this is anything but clich&eacute;d or dry; the growing joy of our two leads is palpable and their explorations all both real and ordinary ( watching street performers, eating and drinking in old cavernous bars and beautiful outdoor caf&eacute;s, a palm reading, street performers, a walk through a cemetery) and fresh because of the commitment that Delpy and Hawke bring to playing characters that are certainly reflective of themselves. Celine is the relatively mature and articulate, politically minded intellectual - Jesse the slightly more posturing and juvenile proto-philosopher whose ideas usually seem more scattered, but also perhaps the more original thinker. At various points each of them takes the initiative, carrying the budding romance forward; at various points each one retreats a little, though overall it seems that Jesse is (slightly) more pushy. There are certainly commentaries about the differences between Europe and America here, but only once does it seem over-the-top (a bar scene where an American couple rudely complain to each other about the service); generally this is a film about what we have in common, not what drives us apart.<br /><br />After the long and wonderful night, it's time for parting. Celine gets back on a train home; Jesse prepares to board his flight. They've made a connection, beyond a one night stand...they vacillate over whether to keep in contact, finally deciding on a scheme that comes straight out of AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER and the childish romantic fantasies we've all had: in six months they'll meet again, at the same time, the same train station. You'll have to watch the equally wonderful Before Sunset to find out how that turns out.<br /><br />If there's a more feeling and wise film about two people meeting and falling in love, I'd like to see it. I've seen this three times and it's only improved on each viewing. As I said above, it's not \\"heavy\\", it's never overly philosophical or artsy, but it's not stupid either - and given the state of American romantic comedy at the time (and since), that would be complement enough; but there's also just enough fantasy and whimsicality here (how is it that the two are so often totally alone and able to indulge in deep, uninterrupted conversations in well-lighted alleys, never disturbed; would the barman really give Jesse a bottle of wine on a promise of later payment, etc) to enliven the situations without taking away from their central truth. We can see plenty of differences between Celine and Jesse developing, but also enough commonalities and real attraction that we really wonder, and want to know, what's next between them. Not many Hollywood romantic comedies leave me wanting more (in a good way); this certainly did.

B0021L8UVC|3.0|Here's what I do understand about \\"Pandorum.\\" It takes place centuries in the future. Earth has become so overpopulated that food becomes scarce. In an effort to save humanity, a spaceship populated by 60,000 people gets a one-way ticket to a new planet millions of miles from Earth, which shows evidence of being habitable. But something goes wrong somewhere along the way, causing countless numbers of the crew to awaken prematurely and mutate into flesh-eating beasts. Others are susceptible to a psychosis known as Pandorum, which is brought on by extended periods of hypersleep. In the grip of Pandorum, the victim becomes paranoid, homicidal, and out of touch with reality. Awakening in the middle of all this chaos are two astronauts, Lt. Payton (Dennis Quaid) and Corporal Bower (Ben Foster), who have both lost their memory.    I understand all that. But really, what is going on in this movie? What are these characters doing? What is the point the filmmakers are trying to get across? It's maddening when you have all the right pieces of the puzzle but are unable to fit them together into anything cohesive. Events are explained, but somehow, none of it sinks in, so either things didn't go right with the editing or I missed something along the way. Whatever the case, \\"Pandorum\\" is about as mysterious as a shadowy hallway stretching endlessly through a spaceship, and I was forced to roam through it with nothing but a light stick and the hope that I would eventually be able to get my bearings.    One thing this movie does get right is the atmosphere. The spaceship, called the \\"Elysium,\\" is a labyrinth of cramped passageways and dark corners for things to hide in. Most everything is illuminated with sticks of glowing colored light that cast eerie auras and reflect off of dirty metal surfaces. The quiet moments are suspenseful and brooding, and monsters continuously pop out and loudly roar. This is one of the most effective carnival funhouse experiences I've had in a long time. The thing is, funhouses usually have the decency to not bother with a plot. Here is a case in which a plot is used not as a way to tell a story, but merely to tease the audience along until it's left hopelessly perplexed. After seeing the film, you can go online and find many websites explaining the plot details, and you will probably understand it at that point. As far as I'm concerned, it's preferable to understand it while actually watching it.    After our astronauts awaken in their sleeping tubes and emerge sputtering, disoriented, and coated in a slimy film, Payton remains in a control room while Bower searches the rest of the ship. Aside from pockets of carnivorous baddies, he also comes across two crew members who have been awake for months, which is apparently enough time to learn how to fight like a martial arts instructor. One of them doesn't speak English, although he does seem willing to entertain the idea that Bower isn't a threat. The other, a lethal, dirt-covered scientist named Nadia (Antje Traue), does speak English and needs a little more convincing as far as Bower is concerned. They then journey towards the ship's reactor, hoping to reactivate it before the rest of the ship's power completely fails. Why is the power failing? Have they been in space longer than the estimated 100-plus years?    Payton, meanwhile, eventually discovers a slime-covered young officer named Gallo (Cam Gigandet), who somehow escaped from the elusive bridge section of the \\"Elysium.\\" It isn't long before he starts showing signs of Pandorum, and I can't say any more than that because it would spoil one of the film's two major plot twists. I will say that neither twist was particularly appropriate given what little there was building up to them. The closest we get to a decent explanation is a poem recited by an insane ship's cook (Eddie Rouse), who in his years of isolation etched the crew's ill-fated story onto the walls. Not that it works; if anything, the explanation leaves me with even more questions about the nature of certain characters and exactly when they came out of hypersleep.    In case I haven't made it clear by now, I didn't get this movie. To me, it seemed like a video game version of Ridley Scott's \\"Alien,\\" minus the convincing story and the plausible characters. I'm well aware that some movies are not supposed to go for the obvious, that we have to actually use our brains to figure things out. But there's a difference between the cerebral and the confusing, and \\"Pandorum\\" can't seem to make that distinction. It wants to tell us a story, but it doesn't quite know how. For the most part, it only gets by on mood, created by means of impressively creepy visuals. Yes, you will find numerous blogs and movie websites dedicated to this movie, and some of them will do a better job explaining the plot than the screenplay did. Maybe you would be better off reading one of them instead of paying for a ticket.
B0002YLC24|5.0|Paris, 2003. Jesse, an American writer in his early 30s, is signing books and giving a talk at Shakespeare & Company, the famed Parisian bookseller that first printed \\"Ulysses\\" in 1922. The book chronicles a one-night stand nearly a decade earlier that he just can't get out of his mind. As he is about to finish, he locks eyes for a moment on a particular face in the stacks: Celine, the woman he met nine years before on a summer night in Vienna. For anyone who has seen and loved BEFORE SUNRISE, the film chronicling that meeting, the moment of recognition in this sequel comes as an all-time great moment in cinema...five minutes in, and I knew I was in the presence of greatness.<br /><br />Celine and Jesse go for a cup of coffee at a caf&eacute;, traversing a half-dozen windy, ancient Parisian streets, and they talk about careers and education, what has led them to this place. Interestingly enough, the dialog was largely scripted by the actors, and they both express (non-acting) interests that mirror the real lives of Hawke (a successful novelist) and Delpy (an environmental activist and musician who has recorded a couple of albums); they also play to their ages and they play characters that are reasonably successful in the outward sense, so a great aura of realism is maintained with little effort. This allows the dialog to ebb and flow, to continue easily for the 80 minute duration of this real-time walk through the streets and gardens of Paris, through life, career, love, lust, politics.<br /><br />And it all may seem very boring to you, if what you expect is \\"drama\\" and \\"event\\"; if you expect your romances to be full of sex and unbelievable situations and jealousy and hysteria. BEFORE SUNSET is 80 minutes of two very intelligent, articulate people reacquainting themselves with each other, reawakening to youthful aspirations and romantic hopes that they assumed were withering. It's a paean to French ideals and American excesses, to Paris and to music and to architecture and literature, all conveyed in the expressions and words of two hopeless romantics and in the passion their director has for the noble idea, so rarely practiced, of the importance and power of each day, each hour, each minute of life.<br /><br />I'm going on a bit perhaps, but I cannot think of a more \\"real\\", knowing film about love, about the lost past and the hopeful future than this minimalist tour through the eyes of a brazen Texan and a talkative Parisian. It's easy for me to fall in love with actresses, but Julie Delpy is simply unbelievable here and I've rarely felt more jealous in a movie than I did of Ethan Hawke (who I rarely like, but is as perfect here as he was in the earlier film).<br /><br />There are many wonderful allusions to film history in this hour and a third but the most potent is the short cruise down the Seine near the end, which brings to mind most obviously two of the most romantic and expressionist films in French history, Vigo's L'ATALANTE (1934) and Carax' LES AMANTS DU PONT NEUF (1991). I was wondering if this film would end there, but instead the couple detours to Celine's apartment for the stunning, very appropriate finale.<br /><br />Along with it's predecessor, one of the very greatest films about falling in love - an re-falling - in the history of cinema.l conveyed in the expressions and words of two hopeless romantics and in the passion their director has for the noble idea, so rarely practiced, of the importance and power of each day, each hour, each minute of life.

B000P12LWY|5.0|I'm a lover of period drama and this is a lavishly entertaining portrayal of Henry the VIII.  However, from an equestrian's point of view, Jonathan Meyers' seat in the saddle ruins it for me every time I see his foot rung all the way thru stirrups all the while his legs are drawing up.  Stirrups were one of the greatest inventions of their time, I wish Meyers would learn to use them properly even if he does spend more time in bed than in saddle.  There's no doubt the King of England would have been a master horseman. Meyers does have some great stunt doubles and Meyer's ability to act while mounted is to be admired considering his obvious lack of skill (loosening that death grip on the reins a bit might help too) but, whatever happened to great equestrian stars like Errol Flynn, Tyrone Power and John Wayne who could really show us how great warriors rode?
0307269981|4.0|Author Stieg Larsson successfully follows up his first installment of the Millenium trilogy, \\"[[ASIN:0307454541 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Vintage)]],\\" with a glimpse of the eponymous Lisbeth Salander's sad and misunderstood past in \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire,\\" a page-turner that keeps the reader entertained and begging for more right until the heroine utters her very last relieved and happy yet slightly cynical acknowledgment of sidekick Mikael Blomkvist's presence.<br /><br />The two main characters, introduced and thrown together during the solving of the disappearance of Harriet Vanger in the first novel, don't share much page-time together in this second installment.  Blomkvist, basking in his triumph over the Wennerstrom group, moves on in his regrouping of his financial magazine to prepare for his publishing coupe of the year: the release of both a book and full edition article on underage prostitution written by a notable journalist and his PhD candidate wife.<br /><br />With her trademark anger and disgust over her emotional love/attachment for Blomkvist, Salander refuses her love further entry into her life.  Always fiercely independent, now, after absconding millions in an exacting act of retaliation from Wennerstrom's private funds, she needs never to work again.  But old habits die hard, she cannot help but `tap into' the lives of those she both loves and hates with her incredible computer hacking skills and the ability to mete out punishment with the dreaded vigilance and potentially lethal retribution of a technologically savvy Erinye.  While in the midst of not leaving her digital fingerprint on Blomkvist's computer, she comes across a name in one of his files that resonates deeply from her past.  Her quest for a connection leads to a triple killing--the journalist, his wife and Dragon Girl's own despicable guardian, Nils Bjurman-whom the reader has learned to hate from the first novel.  When her physical fingerprints on the murder weapon link her to the crimes, uber survivor Salander furrows underground even deeper as a full-scale manhunt begins with an even fuller albeit skewed disclosure of her sad history with Sweden's social services.<br /><br />Author Larsson drives his plot from alternating third person vantage points that give the reader a generalized perspective from a specific corner of the various stratums of Swedish life.  We are privy to varying degrees of freedom as demonstrated by the social class exhibited by Larsson's variety of characters; we can actually feel the weight of burden placed upon certain undesirables by the social infrastructure--the skin of which Larsson (now deceased but also a one-time investigative crusader not unlike his main character Blomkvist) obviously enjoys perforating and exposing for its inability to defend the rights of over half the population it is in existence to protect.  As Blomkvist rallies to prove Salander's innocence, Larsson expertly flips the scene from one exploited social group to another--urbane journalists, world-weary police, underhanded social workers, sex trade veterans, bisexual punk divas and in a group of her own, hacker extraordinaire, primo victim of the system, his murderously vulnerable Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. He creates a wonderful compendium of facts and activities that entertain with a purpose the reader is not likely to forget.<br /><br />Like all such novels, this one relies on circumstances and coincidences that of course pull the book together as a novel with a beginning, middle and an end. Nonetheless, no matter how thug-like I found the gangster-like repartee at times, it works.  Readers will not be disappointed--as this tale unravels it reveals moments of evil and violence that rival in their chilling efficiency and inhumanity the workings of Thomas Harris's Hannibal Lector as he sprang in all his twisted glory on the horror/thriller literary scene in [[ASIN:B001E95ILW The Silence of the Lambs (Hannibal Lector)]]. Larsson actually refreshes a genre that in its blatancy immunized readers to the horror or actual life.<br /><br />Bottom line:  Stieg Larsson's \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" gives those fans of \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" a huge book with more Blomkvist/Salander adventures.  Focusing on the exoneration of Salander for present day murders that link to her past, the reader is in for a treat as some crucial information about her personal history is revealed in the denouement.  Great read and satisfying second installment.  Some sly critique of Sweden's social services from Larsson's perspective and many gruesome examples of man's abusiveness towards objects of control.  Recommended.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />\\"reneofc\\"re that in its blatancy immunized readers to the horror or actual life.

B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Bought my first Kindle and this is the first book I read on it. Loved the first 90% of the book and then it bogged down to a crawl. The last couple chapters were pure monotony. That aside, I could not put this one down till I finished. Wow! Dan Brown does it again....one wild ride through Washington D.C. and American & Masonic history. Kudos! I can't wait for his next publish.

0439023491|4.0|The life of Katniss Everdeen should have been transformed by winning the Hunger Games along with her District Partner Peeta.  But defying the Capitol's absolute control over her life by forcing them to declare two winners has a price:  President Snow himself comes to visit Katniss -- a man so evil that his breath smells of blood.  Katniss's small rebellion in the Arena has sparked real rebellions in the Districts which must be squelched.  As Katniss prepares for her Victory Tour, Snow warns her that she must convince the world that she acted out of love, not defiance, and he threatens the lives of the people she loves -- with Gale first in line to die.<br /><br />Catching Fire has a slower start than the Hunger Games.  I had the feeling that it was a difficult book to write, since it covers more time and encompasses greater events.  There are parts of the book that read like summaries, breaking the rule of \\"show not tell,\\" but these sections are interspersed with other scenes of taut action and emotion.  The relationship between Gale and Katniss is explored more deeply than in the last book, although as a reader, I still find Peeta a deeper character. (My 12 year old daughter, however, is rooting for Gale.)<br /><br />An unexpected twist in the rules of the Hunger Games results in a surprise halfway through the novel.  New fascinating characters appear, and the novel finishes with a cliff-hanger ending that ensures we will be anxiously awaiting the third installment next year.
B001SN78JO|4.0|It lacks emotional depth and has a very basic storyline, but it is good for a lot of laughs, and the liar liar-type premise lets Jim Carrey be himself and muster up a decent amount of laughs. Plus, the whole lesson isn't a bad one, either, even though it's corny and predictable.
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|I loved this movie! Why? Because I love the idea   of having big shiny claws for back scratching!    I loved seeing Wolverine as a youngster and how he   became \\"Wolverine\\".

078401213X|5.0|If you're looking for explosions or anything with a basic plot structure, this movie isn't for you. But if you're looking for something unique, original, and interesting, you have to check this out.    The movie pulls off the black and white perfectly; it sets the tone of the story extremely well. It's an interesting twist on numbers and math; it's a nice exaggeration of the power of numbers. The black and white pixelization technique is amazing, to say the least. When i first saw this, i was waiting for more plot, but what i later realized is how amazingly this movie is in the most subtle ways. It left a lasting impression on me, begging for a re-watch.

0684830485|2.0|I read the first 100 pages and the plot of blowing up a bridge was fine, although the plot is exceedingly slow.  Hemingway does a good job with describing the details of the surroundings.  The main character Robert Jordan will have an observation of another character that is insightful.  Then the old guide Anselmo will have the same observation.  Then the old woman Pilar would have the same observation.  Then the guerrilla guard will have the same observation.  Why is everyone talking about the exact same observation?  It seems pretty bad writing and a poor understanding of human nature for everyone to be echoing Robert Jordan's thoughts.      But that amaturish style wasn't what turned me off of the book.  It was the horrible love story.  I'm a woman in my 30s and maybe this kind of tripe would appeal to guys, but the love story was not only exceedingly unrealistic, but also stupid and insulting to women.  I was curious how this horrible love story would end, so then I read the last 20 pages of the book.  The ending of the love story was even worse than the beginning.      This book was not only not insightful about human nature, it actually ran counter to human nature.      I do like Hemingway's book \\"The Sun Also Rises.\\"  That book is a simple story, but well done.  I recommend that book over For Whom the Bell Tolls.
B001FB4W0M|1.0|The season four in itself is excellent. The blu-ray looks awfully crappy: all my doubts during the grainy episode one were confirmed in the first scenes of episode two when some kind of grid of regular white scratches hovered on the screen ! I am very upset, because the DVD sets of the previous seasons never showed such distracting defaults. And I know for fact TV series on blu-ray can be stunning (HBO true blood's first season). I wish someone put an end to any attempt from blu-ray editors to sell such a bad product : they are the one that are destroying the market and they are doing it right now.
0739319175|2.0|I had a difficult time suspending disbelief.  The writing did not impress me. I kept waiting for more energy and the transition from the mundane to the supernatural or surreal.  It didn't happen for me. The story has it high points and some interesting concepts about the mind, science and the bible; but there was too much pontification by the author.  The premise of the antagonist is the most interesting aspect of the story. The tough CIA chief character was a bit trite. There is too much blah, blah, blah at the end.  I wanted more: more color, more spectacle, more imagination. The politics and machinations of real life Washington, DC hold more intrigue than this story.
B00288KNJU|5.0|The more I watch it, the more I found everything about this blu-ray extraordinary. The image is crystal clear: You can actually read what the characters are writing on their PCs and it makes sense. The writing and the visuals are haunting. This movie may be very scary for the parents but eight years seemed to handle it quite easily. Probably one of the best movie / blu-ray of the year. Completely worth the price.
0006486126|4.0|You will find that this is not a review of A Feast for Crows but of George R R Martin.<br /><br />I started this series a song of Ice and Fire back when a Game of Thrones came out in 2002.  I was a faithful reader through book three A Storm of Swords.  I made the mistake of starting to read George's website, where he told us he had finished the next book but it was too long and the publisher wanted to split it into two books.  We all know that is a great way to make more money so why not. I was apprehensive about what was going on.  George was starting to sell all his toys about the series on his site and going to world com and all the other fan fares. It seemed he was much more interested in traveling and having fun than working. Who can blame him.  He's made a few bucks on the unfinished series.  You know the one we've all been waiting for.  Whats the next book due out? A Dance with Dragons.  What did George tell us on his update page on his we page?  Essentially he said I'm tired of my fans asking me when the book will be finished.  Quit bothering me.  It'll be done when it's done.  He feeds us a chapter or two to keep us quite while he goes on his way having fun making guest appearances at all the cons.  I say fine George do your thing, but I am not going to let someone pull a Robert Jordan on me again. The last book of yours I read was A Feast for Crows published back in 2007, and that will honestly be the last book of your I ever read. I give up.  You thumb your nose at us, I do the same back to you.  I will not read another word written by George R R Martin even if he came to my door and personally asked me to.  Of course we all know that won't happen George doesn't give a rip about his fans.  He's proved it.  If you're tired of writing the series then let us know George. Get a ghost writer.  Someone that will keep a commitment to their fans.  I will never start another unfinished series like this one and Robert Jordan's wheel of Time series.  What a waste of my time, money and emotions.  George doesn't look all that healthy anyway.  He won't finish the series.  Go play with a a miniature castle George.  Hey did I hear someone is building a video game based on the series?  Bet it doesn't get finished.me, money and emotions.  George doesn't look all that healthy anyway.  He won't finish the series.  Go play with a a miniature castle George.

B001EN71CW|2.0|I loved Firefly till Joss Whedon kinda ruined it by killing off half of the team in the Serenity movie instead of rebooting the franchise. This said, the blu-ray looks very grainy and all of the space scenes looked out of focus. I don't really think one have to blame the lenses on this one: when you are selling High Definition, you're expected to give High Definition, not low-def rendering of the CGI's and ultra compressed episodes cramped in the smallest set of blu-rays. Not happy.

B00006AW2F|4.0|I am the Stones Authority. I love reading the other reviews of this album. They are quite good and obviously written by true Stones fans. I had a great time reading them and thought that many great points were made. I won't be redundant. I will just give you my personal reflection on this Stones oddity.    Like others I remember this album always being in the cut out bin, but unlike some others here - I always did find the album cover a little bit enigmatic. Especially before I was a fan or had any knowledge of the band. One of the first albums of theirs that I bought - probably for the very reason that it was cheap and in the cut out bin!    There is some terribly cheesy stuff on here. Most of side one is tough to listen to - \\"I'd Much Rather Be With the Boys\\" - please make it stop. Really bad stuff. Embarrassing. However, the version of \\"Out Of Time\\" is good. \\"Don't Lie To Me\\", is cool. \\"Try A Little Harder\\" if fun also. And finally having \\"Some Things Just Stick In Your Mind\\" on an American release of the album makes it all worthwhile. It is a great tune. It would be worth getting the album for that song alone - if you are a fan.    It is worth getting even if you are not a dedicated fan for what was Side Two of the vinyl issue - particularly for songs such as \\"I Don't Know Why\\", \\"Jiving Sister Fanny\\", \\"Memo From Turner\\" and \\"I'm Going Down\\".  These are killer tracks. They have that rough demo feel, not too polished, not probably the final production that they would have wanted - but it is precisely that \\"unpolished\\" feel that for me reveals just what a great band they are and were at this period of their careers. The raw energy of these four tracks just mentioned is fabulous. This is a great rock band. These are great rock songs. This is what they left on the cutting room floor - in their minds. The greedy Allen Klein has done us all a favor - with this wheat and chaff collection. He saved some diamonds and rubies in the rough. Polish them in your minds.    Is it really four stars? No, not really, but damn - I'll never get tired of listening to the tracks that I mentioned in this review - even if I have to sit and grimace through \\"Walking Through The Sleepy City\\". Yikes! That's bad.
B002CAWNEM|4.0|Very good movie. Genuine acting from all. Enjoyed the plot, and was surprised by the ending. Would recommend this film.
B002KYHZLQ|4.0|All in all, in the end, I really enjoyed this book. It was a little slow to start, and somewhat confusing. It almost felt like the first quarter of the book what a mystery novel, and the mystery was trying to figure out and follow the story line. I found this very frustrating and nearly stopped reading, but I pressed on and was happy that I did so. I'm not going to go into the different aspects of the story, if you want to know that then read the book. My reviews are based on personal experiences of whether I enjoyed to book or not, I hate spoilers so I do my best to avoid them. So, although the book started slow and was confusing, Steven Erikson was able to bring it together in the end. The last quarter of the book I couldn't set down and stayed up late to finish. My biggest disappointment is that book 2 is not available on Kindle.
0470477237|5.0|There are rarely times in history where a content rich book is published in the midst of the very revolution that it is addressing.  Typically, those books are written after the fact, looking back in time.  Socialnomics looks forward.  As the leader of a company that is in the midst of this very transition--from \\"creating and pushing\\" to \\"engaging and listening,\\"  I found Socialnomics to be timely, informative and full of very useful, practical information and case studies.  If you want to harness the power of social media for your business, read Socialnomics.
B002GZQY6Q|2.0|I suppose the proper way to start this review, is disclosing my status with PT. I first learned of Steve Wilson through my love for Opeth. When I learned that he was some of the brains behind a few great Opeth albums... I figured I would give PT a chance. At first I thought they had a pretty silly name, and didn't expect much. In-Absentia was where I started, and I though it was okay. I really didn't fully jump on board until FOABP. I thought FOABP was a much more focused effort. I would say it is still the only PT album, that I can listen from start to finish. I recently got a hold of Nil Recurring. Right away the songs grabbed me. Needless to say, I was pretty excited when I heard The Incident was coming out.    I didn't waste any time in getting a copy to see what genius Mr. Steve Wilson would grace us with. I was immediatly excited when I listened to \\"the blind house\\". Very nice! \\"I am in for a treat with this new one\\" is what I thought. And then I listened to \\"great expectations\\" which was ironic, because that is how \\"the blind house\\" left me feeling. Unfortunately my great expectations were being crushed slowly with that very dull track. I soon found myself wanting to skip to the next song. Unfortunatly the rest of the album, I followed that same trend. I was greatly disappointed to say the least. I then told myself, \\"just keep listening, it will click eventually, maybe it's a grower\\". Well, a dozen spins in my stereo, and I am still not enjoying too much about this record. Honestly it's boring! The heavier, more exciting parts mostly do not work. Is Steve Wilson rapping in one of these tracks? Ok, then... I can respect trying something different, but some of this comes accross as trying too hard.     In the end, this release has some good moments. Who would expect anything less? I really feel like this album is too scattered. The short little filler songs seem un-inspired, and break up the bigger picture of things. I am still trying to figure out how all of the first disc is supposed to be one long song? It doesn't seem to flow that well. Maybe im missing something. Im sure a good amount of PT fanboys will like this regardless... especially after reading some of these reviews. Unfortunately I am going to hold my breath for a better follow-up.    *UPDATE: After reading some comments, I thought I should clarify... This album is great! It's my taste in music thats lacking. lol!
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|The Lost Symbol is like an action movie, if you don't think too hard about it, it takes you for a fun ride. The problem is when you start to look deeper, you realize Dan Brown doesn't necessarily know what he's writing (although his editor should have caught a lot of the details).<br /><br />I'm no symbolist, but his lack of attention to detail in \\"real world\\" parts of the story is disappointing (especially since these don't add to the story).<br /><br />\\"My trace route got blocked, is that even possible?\\" - traceroutes typically get blocked at some point.<br /><br />\\"This IP has a funky format. It's written in a protocol that isn't even publicly available yet.\\" - Then it's not an IP address, and the rest of the internet wouldn't know how to get to the IP.<br /><br />Skids on a UH-60 Blackhawk. Blackhawks have wheels, not skids.<br /><br />I'm sure there are a lot more examples, but after the failed computer speak, I tried to just enjoy the story.
1400063736|5.0|This beautifully written book has stayed with me several weeks after completion; my favorite test of a book is how much I resist the coming end as my little bookmark moves further and further forward.  I was captivated by the ability of the author to speak through the characters chapter after chapter, and deftly weaving seamlessly the disjointed lives together.  I highly recommend this lovely work for quiet evenings after work, when you want to escape into an entirely different sphere of existence than your own.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|Just a wonderful concert showing the scope of MJ's talent and the unmatched love/adoration of his fans.  It was such a electrified performance in front of seemed like zillions of fans! We will never see the likes of it again!
0385504225|1.0|Just read \\"The Lost Symbol\\" by Dan Brown. Major disappointment. He is repititious to no end, there is barely a plot, and it really reads like he's kissing up to the freemasons. Terrible book. Don't waste your time. No suspense, you know what is going on from the beginning, and you hope against hope there is more, but there isn't.<br /><br />This truly was a chore to read and based on his other novels you keep reading it hoping it gets better but it doesn't. The Lost Symbol itself is a letdown and the book truly reads like an apology to the freemasons for any issues he caused them in his previous works. This novel may have been better if it was half as long by removing the many, many repeated statements and definitions. It was a chore to read this book and we all expect better from Dan Brown,
B00005QGAV|5.0|I hadn't listened to much of MJ after thriller because I was mid 30's at that time and did not keep track after that.

He reigns forever in our hearts and in the music of our souls!
B00006IU73|5.0|I'm a huge Pink Floyd fan, as well as a fan of 90s grunge and thrash metal, and it has been difficult to find another artist that sounds similar to Floyd. Then I installed the Pandora app on my phone and logically created a Pink Floyd station. To my surprise, I heard \\"Prodigal\\" from this album, and my ears perked up.<br /><br />Can I explain the parallels between PF and PT? Not with any great deal of accuracy. But I do hear similarities. Steve Wilson's soft vocals ala David Gilmour? Maybe that's what it is. Occasional acoustic interludes? Perhaps. Soaring guitar solos? Ambient soundscapes? Slide guitar? Concept albums? Infrequent but intriguing use of a mellotron or Hammond Organ? Sure, why not. Regardless, \\"In Absentia\\" was my first exposure to PT, and I have since ordered 5 more: the Delirium Years, Fear of a Blank Planet, Deadwing, Nil Recording, and Lightbulb Sun. I also ordered the live concert DVD, and plan on trying to pick up the 5.1 surround mixes of those albums which are available in this format. Lightbulb is probably my next favorite. I plan on owning all of PT's stuff!<br /><br />So take it from a late 30-something PF fan - PT will infrequently but eloquently satisfy the metal lover in you, provide plenty of harmonic vocals, and the well-scripted melodies will come all wrapped in a modern, progressive rock package. If you are a PF fan, listen to \\"Prodigal\\" and you'll hear some similarities with PF - a real treat!
B000AP04OM|5.0|This film was a big surprise for 20th Century Fox, which got a huge hit when something more modest was expected.  The people who made the film were amazed at it's popularity, but it is quite well made and well performed and isn't too sugary sweet.  I find it excellent family fare and they don't make that many good family films these days.  The filmmakers had to contend with a lot of rain when they were doing scenes around Salzburg, Austria.  In fact the opening of the film, when Julie Andrews is singing high in the mountains, was the only take when the sun came out!  Many of the other exterior shots were done under awnings with artificial light.<br />  I suppose its a matter of personal taste but Christopher Plummer can't stand talking about the film and refuses to be interviewed on the subject.  A few years back I was assigned to cover a press conference with Plummer when he was touring in a stage show and we received written notice that there were two things Plummer wouldn't discuss.  One was his daughter and the other was \\"The Sound of Music\\".  Any mention of either would signal the end of the interview, said the notice.  And that's such a shame because so many people love this movie and his performance in it.  He almost backed out of the film when he was told that Bill Lee would dub his singing voice.  Perhaps he is just tired of talking about it but I still enjoy his work as Captain von Trapp.  The children in the movie have all grown up and have children of their own but they will always be young in \\"Sound of Music\\".  Perhaps we all like being reminded of childhood...or the childhood we wish we had.
B001993Y3G|3.0|I enjoyed this movie when it was current and thought I would memorialize with purchase of Bluray. Picture is superb, story engaging, extra minutes adding to the story, but the sound, specifically dialogue, is too low. Had to continually turn up volume, often to near max level to hear/understand what was being said. Not had this issue with any other normal dvd or Bluray. Disappointed.
B0000DETET|4.0|For a metal fan it took me an amazingly long time to get around to listening to the trailblazing work of Venom. I have to say that the experience of this album and the two that followed it, while not quite packing the punch it did when they were first released in the early '80s, is thoroughly enjoyable and surprising. And, from a music history point of view, quite fascinating. I recommend this album and the two follow-ups, Black Metal and At War With Satan to anyone putting together a thorough collection of metal and hard rock.<br /><br />I bought Welcome to Hell together with the other two albums and I have to say that, of the three, this the one that I enjoyed most on the first listen. In true Venom style, the riffs are wicked, the vocals are pure satanic machismo and the lyrics are irreverent and darkly humourous. The sound quality of this album is notoriously bad and I must say that I didn't expect it to be as bad as it is. The album sounds like it was recorded in a dungeon and then someone forgot to mix it before releasing it. On many of the tracks the mixing of the guitar and bass is terrible, resulting in a monstrous mishmash of distorted sound. Famed metal critic Geoff Barton is often quoted as saying, in one of the first ever reviews of this album back in the 80s, that it had the hi-fi quality of a 50-year-old pizza. That may be a bit harsh, but just be warned, that if you're expecting the polished production of Martin Birch, Rick Rubin or Bob Rock, you ain't gonna find it here.<br /><br />However, that does not detract from the experience of listening to the album. In a sense it adds to its status as a metal classic. Before the band's ambitions overstretched their abilities after the At War With Satan album, they perfectly captured the essence of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal - the perfect comination of metal bombast and punk irreverence. Some people might say that this was best captured on Black Metal, but I'm inclined to think that Welcome to Hellwas really their definitive statement. The album also includes what is probably the catchiest piece of satanic-themed metal ever released. If you don't walk around for a week after hearing this belting out, \\"'CAUSE I'M EVIL. IN LEAGUE WITH SATAN\\" either at the top of your lungs or under your breath, then you're probably not a rock fan. So if you're averse to having an infectious piece of devil rock stuck in your head, give this a miss.<br /><br />This reissue comes in a slipcase and has a booklet with great photos and facts. There are also a lot of bonus tracks. Go ahead, it's worth every penny.
B000NTPDSW|1.0|I don't like these Godfather movies, by gosh, bygolly.   Too much violence, not enough sex.      For example, we're told that Fredo Corlieone was \\"banging cocktail waitresses two at a time,\\" but correct me if I'm wrong, we never actually see him banging any of these waitresses.       Sure, during the wedding scene Fredo's brother, Sonny Corlieone, has wall-sex with one of the wedding guests.  But James Caan isn't even Italian!  So what's the dang-deal, man?      And poor Michael Corlieone.  He gets to be Godfather.  The King.  The Big Enchilada.  And who does he get to bang? ... Diane Keaton. ... He might as well work for the post office, man!       Then there's Don Corlieone (no relationship to \\"Soul Train's\\" Don Cor-nel-ius!).  The Don gets to bang Morgana King; but lemme tell ya, that's like drivin' over ten miles of bad road in a Yugo.     Troy Donahue got to bang Connie Corlieone, but since Talia Shire is far-sighted, rumor has it, she thought it was *Phil* Donahue -- which right there would make anyone's stomach turn.    Of course, other than Sonny's brief stand-up routine, we never got to see any decent banging; let alone two or three at a time.  The closest we came to checking out Fredo's action is when he asked Kay Corlieone to stand on a mirror while he drooled pathetically all over his nice Ivy League suit.  AND YOU CALL THAT FILMMAKING!  I've seen better banging at a high school drum & bugle contest.    Now take Tony Soprano.  Now there's a mafia don who sure'nuf can \\"bang 'em two at a time.\\"  Three if necessary.      He banged more service-oriented members of the lumpen proleteriat in one teevee episode than the entire Corlieone patriarchy did in three goll-darn movies.      And Tom, Tom Hagen.  Why, you miserable sexless wretch.  Where's the beef, counselor?  Where's the strudel?  Where's the Ba-Da-Bing girls you're supposed to being bailing out on a regular basis? ... Sir, you disgust me!     In short, whatever happened to \\"sex and violence\\"?  Don't they go together like a horse and carriage?  Like Frick and Frack.  Like Laurel and Hardy and Missus Laurel and Missus Hardy.      Like Dolly Parton.    Can you believe it -- a movie about Italians, and the only guy who gets laid is a James Caan, a bar mitzvah boy.      Oye, the humanity!
B002L5GQGY|5.0|It was amazing seeing Joe play with Eric Clapton.   That had to be one of the highlights of his career. It was a performance by the both of them worth watching over and over again.  With or without Clapton Joe holds his own on this one!  He should be pleased with his performance. Very entertaining and soul felt.
B001FB4VXU|4.0|I love this show. I have the 1st and 2nd season. My husband and I sit down to watch it a laugh a lot. I just wish it had less sexual humor. will be getting the 3rd seaon when it comes out.
0743496736|4.0|I loved this book and I am a huge Picoult fan, but there are certainly some reoccurring themes in her books that really irk me.    First of all, if you've read any of Jodi Picoult's other books you KNEW that Josie would be a pushover when Matt first hit her. I've yet to read one of her books where the woman actually stands up for herself; they're all excessively emotional and weak. I understand that of course there are woman that match this description, but seriously, every single one Picoult?    Secondly, high school is just not like that. Unless schools in other parts of the country are COMPLETELY different from the ones I've experienced, kids are only loners if they want to be loners. Everyone can find a place to fit in. I have never ever in my high school experience (continuing right now) met anyone half as cruel as the bullies in this book.    Thirdly, and this is a literary epidemic of all authors (if minor!): KIDS DON'T TEXT LIKE THAT. Matt once texted Josie and said \\"1/2 2 C U now\\".  Really? How many teenagers do you know that actually send messages that look like that? I know this isn't just Picoult and I know that it's not really that big of a deal, but it always bugs me for some reason.    Otherwise, awesome, awesome book.
0061537969|5.0|A story narrated by a dog named Enzo? The cutesy factor, no doubt, has a lot to do with why this book is so popular and well-liked. One might even be inclined to pooh-pooh it as a contrivance to charm the reader, but this book has much more to offer than mere cutesiness.<br /><br />Enzo, the dog, is lovable and deliriously funny. He describes his life with his master Denny Swift, a race car driver. Denny's forte is his ability to maneuver a race car in the rain better than any other race car driver. Enzo likens the art of racing in the rain to the act of dealing with life's most pressing problems - both undertakings require acuity and a quick wit to negotiate.<br /><br />The book has moments of sadness as well as hilarity. The author's use of a dog as a literary device not only helps to inject humor into the story, it offers a refreshing perspective on the life of humans. The author pulls it all off surprising well.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book - it's funny, inspiring, and heart-rending. Dog lovers will see their canine companions in a whole new light. Read the Art of Racing in the Rain for a hearty laugh. Read it for a newfound appreciation of what it means to be human.
057109659X|5.0|\\"The Ashley\\" was printed in July 1944.  It has remained in print, in hard cover, for sixty-five years.  Surely there is a good reason for this.  In my opinion, as one who fell in love with rope as a Scout longer ago than I want to discuss, this volume is one that will remain in my library until I die.  I may even demand that it buried with me.  I have a friend who, during a unpleasant divorce, lost his copy.  As soon as new living quarters were located, the book was replaced and put in up, in honor, on the shelf.  One simply does not do without the Ashley!
B000WCCUZO|5.0|It seems most people randomly encounter this band, as did I. And whilst I dont think this is a 5 star album in the way of flawless records, in the scope of amazon's rating scale it is worth the 5 stars to get your attention.     The key to this album is melody. Its full of gorgeous melodies wrapped in electronica/rock/punk sounds. Its amazingly different to anything Ive heard before, the synth electronica could be something at a rave party but it manages to ground the music with earthly vocals that are catchy to sing along with. These guys are heavy but not in a pretentious way. They channel some real emotions here, specially for a band who is messing around with heavy metal\rave subject matter which usually deals with more self indulgent angst.         Honestly I think this album went way under the radar because it doesnt belong to any particular genre.(outside of UK).
0385504225|5.0|The book had a ton of information but was very interesting and thrilling to read! I finished it in two evenings! The story was very gripping, very detailed but well explained and written. If one liked the two other bestsellers of Dan Brown then this book you will enjoy as well.
B00005JPCF|5.0|I have seen this movie over and over again.  When it first came out, I didn't want to see, but I am glad that I did.  I love the actors that give these characters life.  I love the music selections and the scores that were performed during the film.  Tap dancing is another form of art and it was amazing that creators can almost make you want to get up and dance right alond with the movie.  This movie is a kids movie, but true big kids will love this.  It also teaches lessons about our effect on other environments, trusting some one, and following your instincts.  What can I say, it was a GREAT MOVIE!!!!!!!!!
B00003CXA6|5.0|balancing the experiences of 100,000 people over 72 hours isn't an easy accomplishment!  yet, the makers of this film have done an outstanding job in assembling and producing a film destined to be the authoritative source for generations.  this balances some of the common experiences of common soldiers with the pressures of mid-line leaders ordered to do the impossible to decision-making of the top brass, often without accurate information, worried for the safety of (lee's) cavalry, who have to make decisions quickly knowing that decisions in war always result in death.  while of great educational value, this film is also tremendously entertaining.  it's longer sometimes than i wish but then other times i could watch it for days.  i found that, at times, it moved tremendously fast.  i guess war does that.  i highly recommend it and i give it an A+.
B001QWEE4E|5.0|This movie broke my heart, it really did. I can't remember the last time I cried after/during a movie. All of the people that are giving this movie 1 star ratings and bad reviews obviously have a problem with the subject matter of the film and are disgusting people. This movie is about what true love is and should be -- it is not based on gender, rules or any stereotypes that go along with gender/culture, but instead just two oridinary people who find themselves in deeply in love and can't deny the passion they have for each other. I can't stop thinking about this movie, it has been haunting me and has been keepin' me wondering... the ending has left me speechless even after watching it three times, and I plan to do it again and maybe again...
0738711500|2.0|I ordered this card deck with the book in August ('09) and I was so pleased when i received the deck!  It's beautifully designed with compelling artwork that depicts the interpretation of each card so clearly.  The deck is easy to manuever and shuffle ... and the glossy finish feels rich yet not slippery in your hands when shuffling.  Now here's the problem... I decided to COUNT the cards in my deck this morning... just some nagging feeling that's been on my mind for a few days so since it was a saturday and i had a few extra minutes i decided to count all the cards in the deck and discovered to my horror that i am missing (YES ...MISSING!!) 6 cards:  the KINGS of each suit as well as the Queens from the Pentacles and Swords.  I'm horrified.  I've been using these cards for a month and NOW i learn that the deck is not complete... and not just missing ONE card.. it's missing 6!!!  So if you purchase this deck which i would highly recommend doing because it's worth it... i would just double check once it arrives that you have all 78 cards... lay out each suit and the major arcana and make sure you have every card.  I hope your luck is better than mine!

B00000JGOJ|1.0|Truly one of the worst screenplays I've ever had the misfortune to encounter. My wife & I cringed our way through the entire movie. The dialog was clearly written by someone with a desperate attachment to his thesaurus. As a previous commenter noted, RUN, do not walk, away from this pitiful excuse of a movie. Not even worth it to see a very healthy looking Jay Mohr pretending to be a dying AIDS patient.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|Mustaine is finally back !! The best talented musician of the historical big four thrash founders, have offered us an excellent and very inspired album. The best since Countdown to Extinction masterpiece.   Endgame mixes very well all of what Megadeth is : Thrash and speed / heavy and melodic / dark and melancholic atmosphere / high level technique mixed with deep inspiration.   My favorite songs : Bodies / endgame / The Hardest part Of Letting Go / The right to go Insane.  All of these summerize well the best of what can Megadeth give.  Buy Endgame, you wont regret it !

1604590483|2.0|I would have loved to read the book, but the font was so small that is was uncomfortable to read -- so much so that I sent the books back.  I had ordered two -- one for me and one for a friend, and we were both uncomfortable with the type face.  There was no selection with a larger type.
1421527618|5.0|I am a United States soldier. Being that I really cant stand to read war novels or anything military related. In fact I like to read anything that can get me as far from reality as I can.<br /><br />I was looking in the public selection on the bookshelf and I noticed this title staring me down. The cover art was brilliant. Big suit of cybernetic armor with Japanese style of art. I said to myself this book has to be good. I know your not supposed to judge a book by its cover but I did.<br /><br />I took it to my rack and began to read it. I was shocked to find how similar it is with our real world yet so far apart I felt like I was in another reality.<br /><br />It had all the basics of the military in it. The Japanese 301st ID and the United Stated special forces. It was also interesting to see the military tactics used portrayed in this novel.<br /><br />This book is Excellent for anyone who just wants to get away for the day or any anime scifi war zone action buff. I picked it up and couldn't put it down. Though short, I think this book was worth more than a lot of legends we know today.<br /><br />Well worth the price.
0307454541|4.0|I have not finished reading this novel yet, but I do recommend it for its story line and character developement. A fascinating mystery book especially at this time in our economy.  I did find the transaltion lacking as far as grammar and syntax.  Nothing major, but a new editing job would be helpful.
B00275EHCI|4.0|Although not one of the best scifi's I've ever seen, it's a decent movie and worth watching at least once. The special effects were excellent, and the story line was okay - this great premise had potential, though I don't feel it was as well done as it could have been.<br /><br />We really enjoy Bruce Willis and in most of his movies, and find that we usually get very invested in the character. In this movie, I think his character could have been a bit more well developed. Also, the \\"bad guy\\" in this movie could have been much more well developed. The script was missing that element in a great movie that makes you sit on the edge of your seat - that thing that makes you really care about what happens to the characters, feel what they feel and want to see them come out on top. Regardless, there was just enough of this so that we thought the movie was decent and worth the time and money.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|We are living through a great age of Jane Austen inspired prequels/sequels and revisions.  Would she be amused or insulted that her works, Pride and Prejudice in particular, have inspired so many others to project what their vision is or what they feel was not stated on the written page?  Who can say, but I personally like to think that somewhere she feels a bit bemused and a bit chagrined, winking and enjoying the whole lot all the same.<br /><br />Amanda Price (charmingly played by the ever talented Jemima Rooper) is a 21st century London girl, unsatisfied with her life and eager to escape her world through the pages of her favorite novel - Pride and Prejudice.  She visualizes the written world of Pemberley, Longbourne and Rosings in her mind and longs for the romance of it all.  Always be careful what you wish for, my dear, for you just might get it and it may turn out to be far more complicated that what you've envisioned.  Enter Elizabeth Bennet (rising star Gemma Arterton) through a doorway portal and commence the hijinks.<br /><br />The entire cast works well together, but the Wickham turnaround in the hands of the excellent Tom Ripley was a particularly witty plot twist that worked well.  The classically trained Elliot Cowan was a marvelous Mr. Darcy and had excellent screen chemistry with Ms. Rooper.  I'm a Janeite and have either read or watched marvelous adaptations as well as lackluster interpretations.  This is, most assuredly, the former and not the latter.

0385504225|2.0|I would probably have given this messy page-turner Three Stars. But then, I had to hack my way through the endless babbling that followed the Grand Climax. Sweet Suffering Moses! Is Dan Brown being paid by the word. It goes on and on, and then on somemore. It's pedantic and pretentious -- and a major buzzkill. It made me really miss the villain -- he was fun to have around, and he knew how to get his point across quickly and efficiently. By the time I hit the final page, I was ready to give the book One Star. But I had enjoyed the climactic moments enough, that I decided to be generous. Which is more than can be said for Dan Brown -- who's desperately in need of an editor who know how to wield a red pencil...
0446402397|4.0|I enjoy a good historical fiction book from time to time.  This book was a very good choice as the reviews had shown.  My actual rating lands in right where the current cumulative ratings sits: 4.5 stars.<br /><br />The book opens up with some mysterious incidents that you know will be explained later but it kept my sleuthing mind on alert from the onset.  I commend the author on writing this book because the era and culture were so different that I had to wait and see what character decisions were made based on consequences.  The investigation component was interesting as it unfolded and was solved.<br /><br />Good characterization.  Decent story.  Steady enough pace.<br /><br />I'll find time for THE SECRET SPEECH which is the next one for this author.
0143113100|5.0|Every educator, every parent of a child with challenges, every child of a parent with Alzheimer's, every doctor, psychologist, therapist, . . . well, I guess Everyone . . . needs to read this book.

0385504225|2.0|This was one of the worst. Author should have quit with DaVinci. he goes off on long winded tangents too many times and I found myself {to his credit} skipping pages and rushing to the END..Mr. Brown seems to have a preoccupation with claustrophobia and all his characters seemed boxed in.It seemed written with an eye toward Hollywood and Not D.C.

B000001E18|4.0|\\"All Over the Place\\"- these lyrics from track #2 \\"Babyface\\" off of this album truly sum up what the Zooropa experience is all about.  More than any other U2 album, Zooropa has no fears of borders or boundaries.  It features standard U2 tracks like \\"Babyface\\" and \\"Stay,\\" but also dares to explore more dance-oriented beat-bumping territory (a staple of 90's U2), with tracks like \\"Numb,\\" \\"Lemon,\\" and the title track \\"Zooropa.\\"  That's just the first half of the album.  It gets even weirder and more special at the close with Johnny Cash (the voice of God himself) singing lead on \\"the Wanderer.\\"  Those are my favorite 6 tracks on the album, and while there are no really weak tracks here, I feel that musically the album lets it's pace slow from tracks 6-9 (though lyrically, the whole album is awesome).  This album, along with Pop are known for being the band's most rushed releases.  If U2 had spent a bit more time on production, especially with the 2nd half of the album, I think this could've been a classic.  Then again, nearly all of U2's albums seem a bit unfinished.  Oh well, I guess we should all just be glad they released it at all and were willing to take risks to make tracks as individual and cool as \\"Lemon\\" and \\"Numb\\" (and the balls on them at the time- to release those tracks as singles- wow - I love U2, but they are playing it wayyyy more conservative these days).
B000YEUUCK|5.0|Forget all the idiot critics! Get it! It is SO FREAKING AWESOME that words can't describe. The SOUND is second to none. The visual is so amazing, that it will mesmerize you. Celine gives a great show, greatest I ever seen. The visual effects are beyond mere mortal's imagination! The general dancing is SO FREkKKkKKKiiiIIiING amazing ( I am jumping on my sofa so great it is). The choreography is very, very delicate an in place and nicely, masterfully, pleasure to watch, done. The direction is so outstanding so no matter how much he was payed it wouldn't be enough.      Celine here is great! I mean GREAT!    It must be watched with great acoustics. I have nice quality full size speakers JBL L890 with HK3490, and the sound is to be heard to be believed. It is just like  be there personally.    Celine, guys thanks for that. It is one of those things that keeps us alive!

0385504225|1.0|I loved Da Vinci Code and enjoyed Deception Point & Angels and Demons.  This book is...a failure.    There are 2 crater-sized holes with this novel:    (1)  I'm sure you're already aware that the basis of the this book is about an Ancient Mysteries that the freemasons have been guarding and hiding in Washington DC for centuries.  It's a secret so powerful that it can change mankind...or destroy it.  The secret had been protected by the Egyptians, Sir Isaac Newton et al, a secret college in England (list goes on and on) and in our current time by the freemasons.  The Freemasons went to elaborate length to protect and hide it for generations.    ...so what is this secret?  what is this Lost Symbol?  Well, I won't spill the beans, but this secret is something very well-known to all of us, and something many of us use daily.  Yup.  It's such a dangerous secret that it's *hidden* right in the open.    Stupid, stupid, stupid plot.  I felt throughly robbed when this \\"secret\\" was revealed.    (2)  This Lost Symbol is supposed to transcend human thinking, philosophy, science and religion -- transcend them all!  But when this secret was revealed, it is VERY faith-specific -- it applies to one and only one faith. Again, what happened to this being all-encompassing?    My advice if you want to read this book -- wait until it shows up at Goodwill.
1932907009|5.0|snyder writes in a breezy style that suggests much of it might have come from him transcribing his own lectures.  on the downside, sometimes he repeats himself and a copy editor might have been helpful. with that said, the book is filled with lots of direct, cleanly-written advice -- this is what you need to know to write a script that will sell in hollywood.  the subtitle is that this is the \\"last screenwriting book you'll ever need\\" but note it doesn't say this is the \\"first\\" book -- within the pages of the book, snyder suggests readers should be get copies of syd field's screenwriting and vicki king's \\"how to write a movie in 21 days.\\"  I think this is a smart move on his part, because snyder does not go through (thankfully) a lot of basics and expects that you have read other screenwriting books and so what he's giving you here is all gravy on top of whichever basic book(s) you've read. well worth reading and his technique for outlining is excellent advice.
B00164KYV4|1.0|\\"He's Just Not That Into You\\" is a sad statement about the independence and strength of the modern woman.    It's almost paradoxical that the female characters are so weak and dependent on the men because the actresses themselves are much more talented the actors are. The film featured Jennifer Aniston, Jennifer Connolly, Scarlett Johansson and Drew Barrymore to name a few. These characters seek to validate their self-worth through the approval of men. Sometimes the men are not so deserving, to say the least.    The point of the movie, and also the same-titled book, ought to be to empower women, to make them realize and accept that some men just aren't that into them. This doesn't mean they aren't valuable or worthy of male attention; it just means that it wasn't \\"meant to be\\" with a particular beau.    Several scenarios of the guy being not that into the girl included the typical: a cheating husband, a man in a long-term, committed relationship who doesn't believe in marriage and several men who just don't call.    However, all is not always as it seems on the surface. One of the above is actually into the woman he is with, but the for-once blatant advice of a girlfriend tells the woman otherwise. This straightforward advice appears to be a turning point in the movie, until another friend scolds the blunt one for, well, being so blunt. Her sudden epiphany dims as her friends suck her back into the apparent delusion which naturally accompanies feminity.    One redeeming quality of the movie is the role of Kevin Connolly as Conor. He himself is desperately in love with Anna (Scarlett Johansson), who in turn takes advantage of his affection yet refuses to commit because of her (despicable) interest in a married man. Her friend (Drew Barrymore as Mary) nudges along her affair saying, \\"Oh, but what if you're soulmates?\\" It is obvious throughout the movie that the relationships that ultimately work are the ones into which the couples put work. However, this nugget of wisdom is discarded for the much more audience-pleasing idea of soulmates and true love.    Speaking of work, the long-term relationships, Beth (Aniston) and Neil (Ben Affleck) and Janine (Connelly) and Ben (Bradley Cooper), deliver the most believably genuine emotions. But devotion will determine which one lasts and which one fails.    Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin) is the epitome of the insecure, single woman. Her first-date nervousness and post-date phone obsession can certainly find audience sympathy. Gigi's character is endearing but also irritating in that she ignores the good advice she receives from Alex (Justin Long, the Mac guy) and continues to overanalyze the actions of every man she meets.    The relatively carefree Mary (Barrymore) and her three gay co-workers offer much-needed comic relief from the puppy dog disappointment of Gigi, the overt sexuality of Anna and the deeply painful emotions of Janine. Yet, another complaint: There were many gay supporting actors but no real homosexual relationships explored. Conor's prospective real estate buyers, a gay couple, seem to say that homosexual relationships are all about sex, completely throwing emotion out the door and perpetuating yet another stereotype.    Everyone pretty much gets a happy ending, whether that is the bliss of marriage, the fun of dating or the independence of single life. The audience, too, enjoys this typical ending, rarely considering the implied acceptance of traditional gender roles.    \\"He's Just Not That Into You\\" perpetuates stereotypes, tells women that they're lucky when they become a man's \\"exception\\" and gives silent approval to the \\"fact\\" that most married men are only thinking about all the women they are missing out on.
B002KH4KSY|1.0|Pass!!!!  Thirteen minutes into this movie and I wanted to stab the two lead characters in the head, and I am NOT a child of the corn!!!      The lead characters are nice to look at, but the \\"wife\\" bitched so much that the Dali Lama would want to punch her in the kisser, and the \\"husband\\" was a reactive putz.   I could not fathom how the two ended up married unless it was a rejected \\"Friends\\" episode!       I wouldn't bother watching this movie unless you lose a bet.

B000002UHG|1.0|There are many Floyd fans who will give 5 stars to, and genuinely love, any band member's solo release. If you are a Floyd fan but also a discerning and critical listener, you'll probably want to check out this album. Just don't expect it to last long on your turntable/playlist.     Now, personally, I love Wright's contributions to Floyd, circa 1969-1977. And when I have the itch to listen to the music I wish Wright could have made as a solo artist, I turn, not to Wright's solo albums, but to Brian Eno. Typical of reviews in the 1970s, one critic wrote in a review of one of Eno's albums: \\"What a wonderland of a zoo, a cross between steaming smoke, atonal mystery and hanging, frothy ditties... This is another typically awesome, stunning, numbing Brian Eno album -- the record Pink Floyd could make if they set their collective mind to it.\\"    Not sure why more Floyd fans aren't Eno fans. Check out \\"Another Green World,\\" \\"Apollo,\\" \\"Here Come the Warm Jets,\\" \\"Taking Tiger Mountain,\\" \\"Discreet Music,\\" \\"Music for Airports,\\" \\"Music for Films,\\" \\"Before and After Science,\\" and especially (after \\"Another Green World\\") David Bowie's \\"Low,\\" made with Eno. Sorry, fans, but this is the music Wright should've made.    Now a disclaimer. Eno's music began to change in the late 70s, during the period when he began collaborating with the Talking Heads (and Devo, and later, U2). The music was typically awesome, but less and less \\"Floydian.\\"
0385504225|2.0|There have been very few books that I have read that engaged me as did the Da Vinci Code. My expectations for this book were very high. The reality was not up to my expectations. I did not find this book to be the page turner that I had hoped for. While Masonic lore is interesting and I am sure that Brown did his research, it did not result in a very good story. The pace was uneven and as has previously been said the arc is very similar to the Da Vinci Code just different names and locations. Langdon's character had very little depth and looking back on the read I think he brought very little to the story and less to the resolution. The end was simply flat, no great revelation, and I was left wondering why I had spent the time reading the previous pages to get there.
078322933X|5.0|I never expected for this movie to be good but i was wrong and really enjoyed it. Mark did a great job in this movie and so did reese witherspoon and Alyssa Milano.  This is the perfect movie to show people that you should really get to know the person before dating because believe it or not people like this really exist. So you want to enjoy a good movie you should watch \\"Fear.\\" I would also recommend this movie to all those little girls out there that enjoy dating tough guys like David McCall and learn about the consequence of Love at first sight.

0143036556|4.0|I enjoyed Diamond's book.  It hits you right were you can feel it and it's scary all right.  The only problem I have with it, and this makes me wonder what else might be pure speculation, is the treatment of the disappearance of the Greenland Norse.  There is currently some thought that they didn't simply disappear.  Several theories are around.  One that they just walked out of Greenland to North America during the Little Ice Age, and another that they left Greenland for North America by boat.  There is also the matter of the plague that was moving around the globe at that time.<br /><br />I'd like to withhold judgement on the Norse until we have further evidence.  The Kensington Stone and other artifacts suggest that they did indeed leave Greenland.  Perhaps they intermarried with the native populations.  Diamond's comments appear somewhat biased against the Greenland Norse, while he seems to adore those clever Inuit.  For a different take on this, I recommend a couple of books: [[ASIN:1400032059 1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus]] and [[ASIN:1931942463 Frozen Trail to Merica: Walking to Merica]].<br /><br />Diamond's solution seems to be the LA gated community.  Gee, I hope not.

0812971825|5.0|It was wonderful to find this lovely book about a New England minister so mesmerizing.  I hated to put it down.  No violence, little action, but plenty of sharp roiling passion in what is a quiet community.  The writing is so skilled and beautiful.<br /><br />I enjoyed this more than Strout's first novel: [[ASIN:0375705198 Amy and Isabelle: A novel]].  Reverend Tyler Caskey's struggles with grief remind us that it is not always just the steps so neatly outlined by grief counselors.  We go through so much more.<br /><br />With each book, Strout gives us greater insights and understanding of complex human salvation.
0439023483|5.0|The Hunger Games is an amazing post-apocalyptic/dystopian novel set in Panem, the former USA. This nation is ruled by The Capitol and surrounded by the 12 districts. In an effort to wield control over the Districts an annual competition called The Hunger Games is held, in which one girl and one boy from each District competes in a fight to the death, which is televised night and day during the competition. When 16 year old Katniss Everdeen's little sister is chosen for the games she steps forward to take her place; Katniss does this knowing that she is probably going to die.<br /><br />This is a concept that has been explored in many different novels over the years. It's a bit of 1984 with a dash of The Running Man and a heaping serving of Survivor. What really sells this book though is Katniss. She is a fighter long before she is chosen for the games. She is the sole means of food for her family, hunting against the rules, dealing in the black market, a strong female protagonist who is not going down without a fight. By using her survival skills and forming an alliance with Peeta, the other contestant from her district, Katniss becomes a challenger in the games. Along the way she is also confronted with her feelings for Peeta as well as those of the boy she left behind at home.<br /><br />I love that this book is written for Young Adults in a way that is exciting and engaging, while at the same time opening their eyes to injustice without it seeming like a history lesson. So many topics are touched upon; a nation filled with so many poor and a handful of very rich, the use of fear to govern, Big Brother watching every move, even the issue of our addiction to `reality tv' and questioning how real it is.  To have a female character that uses her brains to survive, without losing her humanity, is a great achievement, although the games and deaths are very, very brutal. The burgeoning love story between Katniss and Peeta is handled well, with just enough romance to not be mawkish and the book doesn't wrap everything up completely, since the last line is: END OF BOOK ONE.<br /><br />The tiniest of complaints is at times some of the writing feels a little repetitious, but that is a small criticism for a truly riveting story.<br /><br />Now I need to get Catching Fire, book 2.the book doesn't wrap everything up completely, since the last line is: END OF BOOK ONE.

0385504225|3.0|I actually liked The Lost Symbol better than The DaVinci Code.  The latter was, for me, a real letdown.  It has a fast-paced plot that built up excitement and set readers up for \\"the big reveal\\" only to give us a resolution about the supposed feminine divine that was a stretch to accept at best.  The Lost Symbol, on the other hand, doesn't purport to be more than it is -- an entertaining look at the architecture of Washington, DC, based on a plot that shows how easy it is for a zealot to misinterpret ancient (or sacred) writings to the great harm of all concerned.<br /><br />And I think the plot in itself is an allegory in that Brown is pointing out a more mundane truth -- some people in our world today misinterpret sacred writings (aka scripture) to the great harm of everyone.  There is clearly a great deal of symbolism in the artistic expressions of humankind, whether those expressions be in charcoal on a cave wall, in oil paintings of the Vatican, in the design of public buildings or in the written word.  Those of us who cross over the mental line to narcissism and come to believe that only \\"we\\" (aka our clan, tribe, religious group, etc.) have deciphered the truth can become a truly dangerous force in society.<br /><br />So my take on The Lost Symbol is that it's an average read, offering its readers amusement and a moral caution.  My advice to those who haven't yet read it:  wait for the paperback.
0671015206|4.0|The Millionaire Next Door is an explanation of the findings by the two authors who have investigated the wealthy over the past 20 years. Their findings completely break the typical stereotype and are fully backed up by their statistics.    The best part of the book for me was their explanations not for now people became wealthy, but how raising their kids affected the wealth of the next generation. Particularly how helping your kids can actually be an impediment to them being wealthy one day due to a reliance on their parents income. My wife and I will be referencing this once again when our kids get older to be careful of the things to avoid.    The one negative I have on the book is that the statistics were too overwhelming...every page had another 20 numbers and it became hard to keep track of when the numbers are their to back up the statements being made, and the focus should not be on the numbers themselves.    Definitely worth reading to better understand the wealthy (and not just the stereotypes).
0385341008|5.0|I'm not sure what I was expecting when I first heard of this book and thought I wouldn't like it. I was completely wrong. It is wonderful.  It is one of those books that I want to crawl into and live in the place, be friends with the characters and live the story.<br /><br />In a lot of ways this book was my fantasy. The main character is a writer who begins a penpal relationship with several people on the island of Guernsey. As she learns more about their lives she  then decides to write a book about their experiences during the occupation in WWII. By the time she arrives, she is already loved by most of the townspeople. They prepare a wonderful little house for her and she is welcomed into their lives with open arms and hearts. It's almost too good to be true but it's told in a way that makes you want it to be true. There is enough drama in the story she is she writing to counter balance the fairy tale quality of the rest of the story.<br /><br />I could easily see this as a movie. It reminds me of the movie \\"Under the Tuscan Sun.\\" It has a little bit of romance, humor, drama, a cast of quirky but lovable characters.  What more can you ask for in a book? I loved it.  I may have to start re-reading it again tonight.

B001VPJYZK|5.0|I love this show!!  I own the past 4 seasons on DVD. I wanted to purchase the 5th season on DVD so I can review past episodes.  So much happens on this show, that I don't always pick up on it all the first time around.  I especially wanted to review the last couple shows to prepare for the new season.   I liked the 7th bonus DVD.  It shows the behind the scenes, table reading, and focused on the 100th episode!!!
B002BFBAUG|3.0|Previews and ads for this movie had you thinking it was going to be some funny comedy along the lines of Superbad... no sir.<br /><br />The movie isn't bad per say on it's own merits, but it's not what I expected when I started watching it.  If you are in the mood for a \\"coming of age\\" movie with a few tiny sprinkles of comedy then watch it.  I can't say I enjoyed it since I thought I was going to see a funny movie from beginning to end.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|Yes, I too agree that this season wasn't as good as earlier ones, however, it was still far, far superior to all the crap that people make themselves watch these days. I'm a male, a musician (in fact, I used to play in two bands with a very famous drummer that Lane mentions in one episode in the series, much to mine and my daughter's delight!), and I am dad. But surprisingly, from time to time, I come cross other men, and male guitar students of mine, who love the show, as well. (Generally, I find it's the more \\"intelligent\\" and less narrow minded, amongst said \\"males\\"!)      I truly enjoyed reading \\"Andromeda's\\" review (beautiful name, by the way!), and it's too bad she couldn't have written for the show! Perhaps it might still be in production!       Finally, when I saw the final show on television, I was left with the feeling that the series was \\"up in the air\\", so to speak. In other words, it seemed like a \\"just in case, this is the last season\\" sort of ending, and it could have been much better. As far as another season goes, time is running out, and it dosen't help that some of the season's stars are now becoming movie stars. However, I think there's a genuine possibility that a sort of \\"reunion\\" show could be possible. Two hours worth would be nice, but it would take everyone writing to Warner Brothers, as well as to the cast members, Ms. Palladino, etc. and don't think it can't be done!! When enough dvd buyers pressured CBS to continue making, and changing back the original soundtrack for the classic television series, \\"The Fugitive\\", they finally gave in! And if internet viewers can actually convince a major motion picture company to create something as silly as \\"Alien vs. Predator\\", then the public truly does have a voice. But we just need to make the effort, sooner, rather than later!
1601251505|4.0|(sorry for my english grammar as i'm not native speaker)<br /><br />Pathfinder is a really really great Role Playing Game, only it's not for beginners.<br /><br />I think is all and everything a long-time D&D and D20 player might like in a RPG.<br />On the other hand ,the rules area a little too \\"cumbersome\\" for absolute beginners to roleplaying.<br />That applies if you are going to be the Dungeon Master (for the other players playing Pathfinder is almost the same that any other RPG).<br /><br />It is also -for sure- the best version of D20 rules. It has a lot of small and smart changes and twinks from 3.5, done to balance the gaming and adding interest to some clasess (basically the core ones).<br /><br />AND, actually, it does allow full \\"retro-compatibility\\" with the hundreds of D20 books that have been already released.<br /><br />The edition features of the book are quite nice, clean and well done. The art is good (specially the items and magical items, the illustrations are fantastic!)<br /><br />Finally, as a personal reflection: if you are a DM, i think that -maybe- is a good idea to choose a game supported by an strong company, and Paizo seems to be, now, one of those (of course is not the only, but i'm talking Pathfinder now). This way, you can have fresh adventures and other books on a monthly basis.

0756405890|3.0|This book seems to have evoked a wide spectrum of responses, from \\"Brilliant!\\" to \\"This is the worst piece of &%$# I have ever read!\\" I do not begin to rank this book with such five-star works as \\"A River Runs Through It\\" or \\"Billy Budd\\". Likewise, if you have never read ANYTHING worse, you are lucky indeed; this novel is far better than such truly woeful dreck as \\"Metanoia\\" or \\"Earrings of Ixtumea\\", for example. I come down in the middle. Rothfuss's prose is quite literate and readable, occasionally even stylish, and he has an interesting story to tell. A number of reviewers have complained that Kvothe, the hero of the story, is just too good at too many things with too little effort to be entirely plausible, and there is truth in this; on the other hand, Kvothe's cockiness, arrogance, and impatience are constantly and quite believably landing him in trouble. The story is told in a frame-and-flashback format, with present dark happenings across the land presumably connected to similar sinister doings in the deep past recounted by Kvothe as he tells his life story. Parts of Kvothe's autobiography are definitely longer than they need to be, and the tale drags in places. Also, Rothfuss chooses to end Volume 1 of his tale in a completely inappropriate place, so that the book really does not stand on its own. In my opinion, if an author chooses a serial format, each volume should have its own story-arc with some kind of closure at the end, so that each volume is in some sense a complete story that can stand on its own as while still being a part of a larger narrative. But there is no closure at all at the end, and we are left with the feeling of having read part of a book---which is poor serialization. As I understand that Rothfuss has already written the rest of the tale, perhaps it were better had he simply published the entire story in a single volume. (I have this same complaint about some other works, notably in the Fortress series of Carolyn Cherryh, of which I amotherwise fond.) Is this story most appropriate for adult or young-adult readers? I suppose both could legitimately find something in it. I think the Harry Potter comparisons of some reviewers are overdrawn, as Rowling's work is largely social satire dressed up in magical trappings, which \\"The Name of the Wind\\" definitely is not; I don't find them particularly similar, despite the few commonalities other reviewers have pointed out.  All in all, it looks like the whole story will be worth reading, despite its shortcomings.
B002BFBAWO|5.0|Adventureland is a small film that takes hold of you in a big way. First, this movie is not for everyone. If you are expecting the wild antics and R-rated slapstick of Superbad, you'll probably be disappointed. Since this film was marketed to the Superbad audience, I felt confused during the first twenty minutes of the film. No worries: once the characters catch fire and the the back story is explained Adventureland soars.<br /><br />Adventureland mirrors my past: I went to college in the eighties, worked a lousy min. wage job and partied in the same cavalier way. This little movie nails this aspect of life (my life, anyway) better than any film I've seen.<br /><br />The basic plot of boy (young man) gets a part time job he hates and finds a beautiful girl he loves is nothing new. The attention here is in the nuanced details: the laser accurate acting and poetic cinematography.<br /><br />The eighties soundtrack fits perfectly (the Cure's Just Like Heaven and INXS' Don't Change come instantly to mind.) Kristin Stewart  (a talented young leading actress who is not a bimbo) as Em steals the show. In one memorable scene, Velvet Underground's Pale Blue Eyes plays as she drives our hero (Jesse Eisrnberg)home. Em's face and light blue eyes shine with a vulnerability that is both endearing and heart wrenching.<br /><br />This film is a thoughtful one that is filled with metaphors (the amusement park rides, games and setting are life) and irony (the disparity between what we think we know about someone and who or what they actually are.)<br /><br />Adventureland's most thought provoking message: Those youthful days (and nights) within the framework of jobs we hated were the happiest times of our lives...<br /><br />Highly recommended for fans of Catcher in the Rye, Almost Famous, John Hughes films and the kinder and gentler moments in Judd Apatow movies.
B00204AA0O|5.0|One point which I haven't seen mentioned is that Regina's voice is actually  better than on her other albums.  Surprising to me; I don't know how she did  it, but all notes to all songs seem to be exactly on the pitch she wants.    Bravo Regina!    Of course, Regina writes songs, poems, and poetic songs.  If you don't try  to interpret some of these as you might for poetry in a freshman English class,  you won't get as much enjoyment from Far as you could.      I think that the songs on this CD are uniformly excellent.  No explicit lyrics  since they limit your audience, but Regina controls the material and doesn't sell  out.    As good or better than her previous CDs.  Overall quality is even higher IMO. One   fan called Regina's songs \\"angel's kisses\\".  I concur.
0385504225|1.0|I have read all of the Dan Brown books.  After so many years waiting for a follow-up to the previous good works by Dan Brown, I feel that this book has a great deal of research/information about symbols in Washington and a very slim plotline.  I pre-ordered the unabridged audio version.  There are 15 CDs.  I am on the 9th CD and I can barely get through it.  With a background in medieval literature, I enjoy symbols and archetypes and all of that wonderful literary fun, but this is supposed to be a novel, not a textbook on symbols.  At 2/3 of the way through it, I feel certain that I can guess how it all turns out.  And if I'm surprised, it won't even be fun.  This is a slow, wordy book.  It should have been edited a whole lot more.  All in all, I wish I had waited to order it -- with another rewrite, it could be good, but a lot shorter. And, actually, hasn't the Masonic thing been done to death since the DaVinci Code?  The characters are not fleshed out enough to care about them.  Even Robert Langdon seems to have gone weak in the knees.  No one can have a great success every time, but this is so sad.  I had really hoped for an enjoyable, suspenseful novel.  His first book was more of a page-turner than this one. Maybe the next one will be better.

6305308659|5.0|This movie was one of the few films made in recent decades with a truly original plot (another one was The Truman Show). I admit that I went to see it, expecting another leftist political propaganda movie from Hollywood, full of the usual cliches. You can argue either way that it is and it is not, but like Dead Man Walking, it does a superb balancing act. It starts out portraying the grim statistics of the present day and the contemporary characters are nothing if not contemptible (the mother is chasing after a single guy, leaving the kids alone; the sister is a cheap whore). The teenage boy takes refuge in overdosing on a 50s black and white TV show where you have a nuclear family and the horrors of contemporary life are absent, and then he is catapulted there. Once there, however, things are bland, too bland. Once he starts introducing books into the kids's lives and once the slut starts screwing around anything with pants, color begins to come into the picture. Unfortunately, things start to break down and some people suddenly start to act in a decidedly nasty way and the parents break up.  Definitely an original film. It is surprising that Hollywood produced it.

What kind of a moron would write such a script? What kind of a director would direct such a script? Perhaps the most pathetic of all were all the Trekkies coming out of the movie, grinning from ear to ear, giving a thumbs up to the movie. These particular Trekkies, if you were to put on a movie starring vegetables as the Star Trek crew, with the cucumber having pointed ears pasted on it, they would come out of the movie saying it was a great movie.

B0009MAP9A|5.0|First, the sound: this remaster is truly an improvement over the previous flat and compressed CD.  The remaster opens the audio picture and makes Dylan's voice sound crisp and his guitar resonant.  This remaster is a pleasure to listen to on your sound system or headphones.  Hands down superior.    Secondly, popular opinion regards TIMES as inferior to FREEWHEELIN'.  To each his own, but I'm baffled why fans say that.  I play TIMES more often than FREEWHEELIN'.  I find Dylan's phrasing on this recording more assured, his signing more confident.  True, the overall tone is more serious than FREEWHEELIN' and even preachy (the title song, ONLY A PAWN IN THEIR GAME, HATTIE CARROLL) with only the occasional ballad (i.e. Boots of Spanish Leather) to enliven the atmosphere.  However, to regard this as inferior is ludicrous.  TIMES marks a step forward -- TIMES and HATTIE CARROLL match any songwriting on FREEWHEELIN' -- and ONE TOO MANY MORNINGS as as touching a love song that Dylan has ever written and performed.  Some regard this album as narrow in its vision, but I say that TIMES is focussed, like a laser beam.      If I have one complaint it is the closer, RESTWELL FAREWELL, which LAY DOWN YOUR WEARY TUNE should have replaced, but was left off, eventually winding up on BIOGRAPH.  Similarly, it's a pity that PERCY'S SONG (also on BIOGRAPH) or SEVEN CURSES (BOOTLEG SERIES 1-3, both fine outtakes, didn't make the final cut.    Personally, I rank THE TIMES THEY ARE A-CHANGIN' in Dylan's top five albums.  It is an early masterpiece and belongs on the shelf of any serious music lover.
0312539517|5.0|While the description that Amazon offers up puts this book in the abysmal category, I disagree.  I found this to be a great read, regardless of the flashback recounting his years of life.  To me, that gave George Mallory some character and by the end of the book, some charm and upsetting that one may never know whether Mallory reached the summit of Everest although Archer injects his opinion on the matter and in doing so, I tend to agree. I wonder if his wife Ruth regretted telling her husband that she very much approved and supported his quest to scale the summit a second time, although she really didn't.  The book was a fast read, and I guess you could say you could easily put it down, but then I found myself wanting to pick it back up real soon to see when George finally made his final ascent.  If you like Archer as I do, then this is a must and thoroughly great book to read.  With that said, having just finished E.L. Doctorow's book entitled 'Homer & Langley' I wish Archer had tackled those two character's and what the outcome of that book would have been instead of a boring read.  So interesting how two different author's can really make a difference in what and how they write.

014132161X|5.0|What I love about Nesbit's work is how fresh and vivid it is; how the lives and actions of the characters are immediately recognizable and human. Across nearly a century and vast distance of class and technology, these five children could be our own. Their curiosity, resolve, foolishness, excitement, fear, bickering, confusion, and happiness could be our own.<br /><br />Well, I love that ... and Nesbit's sly and sharp wit.<br /><br />Regarding the first review<br />&lt;&lt; the actual execution was a little too preachy or didactic for me. I like my lessons to be subtle...>><br />I didn't find it preachy. Sure, the children had their wishes granted, and the results were, ahem, not what they expected. This is not preaching; it's just using a classic theme that has been the source of thousands of great stories for thousands of years, with a curious mix of modernization and satire.<br /><br />&lt;&lt; I struggled with the way this book defined class...\\"poverty\\" means only having a few servants instead of many >><br />Yes. The British gentry lived in splendid privilege, often without knowing it.<br />No. This does not disqualify from enjoyment any story whose characters are privileged British children.
0307588335|3.0|Most of the books I've read about the current financial crisis have been written by economists, journalists and other experts. Lawrence McDonald was a trader at Lehman Brothers and his book, A Colossal Failure of Common Sense: The Inside Story of the Collapse of Lehman Brothers, presents a personal perspective on Lehman and its demise. Reading this book is like sitting in a bar listening to a regular guy tell his work stories in colorful language, loaded with personal opinions about people and events. McDonald told his tales to Patrick Robinson who wrote this book. If a reader keeps in mind that McDonald was one of 25,000 employees at Lehman, that he was there only a few years before the company failed, and that he was fired before the bankruptcy, expectations about insight and perspective can be contained. Rather than the subtitle's claim to be the inside story of the collapse of Lehman, A Colossal Failure of Common Sense is a personal story of one person's work experience on a small team of people with a bucket of opinions about what was happening all around him.<br /><br />Rating: Three-star (Recommended)
0060849827|5.0|I bought this book for my emergency survival kit. It is a small but powerfully informative book. If I were to become displaced from my home or lost in a forest this little book would be my best friend. The book cannot help you if you do not have some essentials on your person such as a knife, compass, fire source, etc. So prepare your emergency kit as nescessary, the book will provide good examples on how to do so.
0316010669|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell understands the concept of writing for the reader; he is able to empathize with the layman while keeping the book informative and interesting.     It is a very interesting book detailing the power of the brain that we never knew existed; he writes mainly about the subconscious actions of our brain and how it effects our conscious actions without our even realizing it.     Gladwell does his best to introduce novel concepts in simple terms so that everyone (even those with no prior exposure to neuroscience or psychology) can understand it without having to go back to re-read sections at a time. Although he writes about a relatively new subject, his colloquial style is unassuming and modest. His master prose and story-telling ability help to relate these new ideas to real-life stories. It is important to say that all ideas proposed in Blink are theories; it is more speculation based on insight and analysis than hard facts.    Blink is about rapid cognition, about the kind of thinking that happens in the blink of an eye. More generally, it is a book about intuition and how people harness this power or how it causes situations to go awry. Gladwell uses a variety of real-life examples to push his point, spanning from gambling to speed dating to police situations. The overall theme is that the mind can subconsciously understand a situation before the individual can consciously decode it; the mind can also erroneously conceive the details of a situation due to pre-determined associations made through society. He quickly jumps between stories as he discusses various topics such as thin slices, priming, expertise, selective processing and mind reading. Gladwell's style of writing may leave the reader slightly stranded as the reader attempts to figure out why he tells the stories he does. He leaves the reader curious about the association between concepts and stories until he finally and unexpectedly explains the relationship. Gladwell's great skill has alwaysbeen to take mostly mundane, unnoticed topics and bringing them to public attention in a way that makes us wonder how we never noticed it before.     Gladwell at times strays from the topic of his own book simply because he wants to tell another interesting story. He stretches to connect some examples of theories to the overall theme of rapid cognition. For example, his analysis of the Coke vs. Pepsi question boils down to the \\"sip vs. whole-can-drinking.\\" This has nothing to do with rapid cognition but rather of first impressions. To his credit, he explains his ideas of why first impressions are rapid cognition but only relates them to first impressions of people, and not to the senses. Another topic where he strays from the overall theme is over analysis. It seems that instead of trying to prove the power of rapid cognition and thin slicing, he tries to prove that over analyzing in certain situations is more detrimental than good. This notion of proving one idea wrong in order to show that another idea is correct is at best childish.     Gladwell gets his information from many researchers focused expressly on the topics he writes about. While it is clear that the researchers are doing very prominent work, Gladwell instead spends a lot of writing space describing his interactions with the researchers. It almost seems as if he is infatuated more with the person performing the research than the ideas behind the research itself. In some cases (but not all), the background of the research is prudent and helps to clarify why the researcher is individually important to the story.     Blink ends in a very abrupt manner. There is no summarization or recap of ideas as the reader would expect. There isn't even a formal conclusion about rapid congnition at the end. Instead, it seems as if Gladwell just decided he was done writing and stopped. The book would do much better with a formal ending that summarizes the broad range of concepts explored in Blink.     Malcolm Gladwellchooses great topics to explore in Blink and has great enthusiasm in his writing and story telling; however, many of his arguments for the topic are left unfinished and sometimes seems to be mere speculation. I highly recommend reading this book to be introduced to new ideas of subconscious levels of thinking but be cautious. Not everything in the book is fact and further self-driven research can find more information based on scientific research.
1423332873|5.0|I could not put this book down.  The way this book was written made the characters very real and complicated.  At times you don't know whether what Frank and Mamah were doing was stupid, crazy or brave.  Maybe it was all of the above.  Whatever people may think of their circumstances or decisions, one thing is clear.  They obvioulsy loved each other and risked everything to be together.  This book really explores the ups as well as the many downs of what an affair can do to everyone involved.  The book was touching, sad and realistic.  One of the best books I have read this year.
B002GZQY6Q|5.0|More amazing music (and musicianship) from one of rock's best kept secrets. I highly recommend this record, and I highly recommend you pick up more of their stuff.
1840225564|5.0|Book is in perfect condition.  I'm very happy with the purchase.  The book itself is gigantic which makes it a little uncomfortable to read, but well worth it.
0385504225|4.0|A good, not great, follow up to The Da Vinci Code.  Well-researched and intricately plotted.  I did figure out something important very early in the book, which was revealed very late in the book.  I don't consider myself necessarily astute at forshadowing and therefore felt a little letdown by this piece of the puzzle Brown attempted to hide.  Still a good read - I had to find out for sure that my guess was correct!  Perhaps it read more easily since I am more familiar with Washington D.C. than I am with Rome or Paris (from the previous two Langdon books).
B00005K9LM|4.0|One of Priest's best albums, but a horrid sounding remaster. The remastering was done at such a high level that there is very audible clipping distortion all over the place. Very, very sad.
0375842209|5.0|This book is one of my new favorites.  Beautifully written, original, well thought wording.  This is only the second book that actually made me cry!  Loved that, while it is a depressing subject, it did not depress me.  Instead, I felt drawn to it because of the characters' hope and love for one another.  It took me a bit longer (about 30 pages) to really get into it, but once I did, I was hooked.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|Great CD!  She sounds great.  I've already heard two songs from the new c.d. on the radio, this will be another classic.  Way to go, Whitney!!

0385504225|2.0|Ugh ... well - I've read the trilogy, and this one was the worst.  The ending was such a let down. I found that I couldn't wait to get through the book - not for more, but for it to end.  Very sad because I *LOVED* \\"Angels & Demons\\" and \\"The DaVinci Code\\".  Bummer ...
B000001EAQ|4.0|This much-maligned album from U2 was relatively unsuccessful. It only sold to platinum X1 status, had hit singles that fizzled and no nods from the Grammys. It marks a self-conscious reinvention of a band that reinvented reinvention with their 1991 smash-powerhouse Achtung Baby. Here they try to do the same thing that they did on that album but less successfully. They reinvent themselves to include techno in their sound and they give their music a more danceable approach.     In one case, the ballad If God Would Send His Angels, the techno electronica thrown in ruins the song. In other songs we get a \\"the world is going to end while we're out here having fun\\" message. This should've been a fun, carefree album with less rant and more rave (as in rave party). It is still a great album, but in this case, U2's need to save the world backfires. Long-time fans don't know whether to love it or leave it and casual fans miss it altogether for the lack of hits. It's more of an acquired taste but once you're open to whatever it brings, it unloads some of the best songs of their career. Highlights:    Discotheque  Do You Feel Loved  Mofo (Yes, a U2 song)  Staring At The Sun  Last Night On Earth  Gone  Please    This is not on par with Achtung Baby in terms of quality, but with 7 songs as highlights, this would've been a monster hit in the old days. I wouldn't recommend it for casual fans or the uninitiated, but for old fans and fans of art-rock in general, it's an exceptional album that grows on you with time.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|This was another great book by Dan Brown. I love the Robert Langdon character and I would definately recommend this book.
B000RO9PXC|5.0|I don't understand why anyone who hasn't seen The Doors live would even try to review this 2 cd set. First of all the music is first rate, and the Jim Morrison performance is second to none, If you never seen the band in concert as I have, don't even try to review them. I am over 50 years old, and have seen them more than once in LA. This is The Doors at there very best. This is what rock n roll in 1970  is all about. If you want studio recordings buy those , otherwise get a clue, dude. 10 STARS.
0316017922|4.0|'Outliers' is certainly an enjoyable read packed with interesting investigation of stories behind successful people such as Bill Gates and the Beatles. A chapter where I find particular interesting is about the culture of Chinese farming and the implication to the students' results in mathematics tests; being a Chinese myself, I do feel that Malcolm Gladwell's reasoning coherent. Unlike so many superficial self-help/management books out there that try to uncover the key success factors of successful people; 'Outliers' concisely illustrates the philosophical perspective that life is full of random incidents and serendipity that are beyond one's control, and there is no secret 'how-to' in becoming successful (it points out that hard working and lots of practice can help though, yet this should be considered common wisdom). Somehow it also reminds me of the Forrest Gump quote: My momma always said, \\"Life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.\\"
B00006WUWN|5.0|\\"I Love Gold\\"........... Goldmember is the hilarious 3rd installment in the franchise and hopefully not the last, Mike Myers as always Very Funny, Dr.Evil,Scott Evil, Mini-me, and now Michael Caine. \\"English-English?\\" \\"Shat on a Turtle??\\" very funny movie.
0385504225|3.0|This book is not terrible. Dan Brown is not a horrible writer.    However, this book does fall short of his previous novels. I was able to easy deduce who the villain was (I was secretly hoping for a surprise twist with the father at the end), some characters are introduced and then glanced over, some things are laid out but never analyzed, the plot lines don't harmonize at the end like the other books, and the ending is like....yea, so much for a secret.
0743496736|3.0|I found this book to be a decent read - Jodi Picoult is a very good storyteller, and in that regard, this book is no different than her others.  What bothered me was the number of similarities between this fictional school shooting and Columbine: the hand-made sign begging for help; the critically-injured student trying to escape from a broken window; the fact that one teacher was killed; the shooter's use of a diversionary bomb; the killing of one special-needs student; the finding of students hiding in storage cabinets several hours after the threat was over; the later suicide of a student's mother... it was as if Picoult researched Columbine, and thought, \\"Now THAT would make a riveting novel!\\", changed some details of the shooting itself and turned it into a story.  With so many similar details, I felt as though Picoult was almost trivializing Columbine.    For a fascinating and moving account of the actual school shooting at Columbine, please check out [[ASIN:0446546933 Columbine]] by Dave Cullen.  After reading that, 'Nineteen Minutes' seems just a bit silly.
0756405890|5.0|This novel is really excellent - if you are at all a fantasy reader you'll really enjoy it and this is one of those novels even non-fantasy readers will like.  Best thing I've read in the genre since George R R Martin's third Ice and Fire novel A Storm of Swords.<br /><br />While the broad outlines of the story are not wildly original, there are a host of details that make this just a treasure to read.  I laughed out loud repeatedly, not only at some of the dialogue and observations and situations, but also at the sheer elegance of the writing.  This is very much a character-driven work; the world is described in some detail but it's clearly a backdrop for people who find inner strength in difficult situations.  The music and poetry go beyond the standard and the emotional content packs a wallop.  Looking forward to the next two.
B002GZQYMK|4.0|This is my first exposure to Muse. I found \\"Uprising\\" to be the best of both worlds. Easy to listen to with a great sound, but the message is so powerful it made it a must READ for my teenagers. Great message there, as in \\"Un Natural Selection\\".  I have never been politically involved until recent events, and this music feels like an anthem for our times.   Top this off with a great sound overall and I really enjoyed this CD. In fact, after hearing it I purchased a second one and sent it to my son! Good Stuff!!!
0385504225|1.0|I like compulsive page-turners as much as anyone even if my idea of beach reading is Jane Austen or the original blockbuster novelist, Dickens. I'll even confess to enjoying the film versions of Brown's earlier blockbusters: They're undemanding and relatively fast-paced. But once again we the public are leaping like lemmings off a cliff with a book that speaks to the lowest common denominator in writing. Yes, I've read it, hoping for the best, and found it as poorly written, speciously argued, and feebly constructed as the rest of Brown's oeuvre. Had anyone other than this billionaire author penned The Lost Symbol, it would languish at the bottom of some forgotten pile of unoriginal, uninspired and unpublished manuscripts. Instead, Brown will reap immense rewards while other authors and better books go un-championed. What about Alan Furst? He gets Paris and the French right, and sets a wonderful mood. What about the late, great Michael Dibdin (recently RIP'd)? He got Italy--and America (his inspector, Aurelio Zen, is as lively as Brown's \\"symbologist\\" is deadening). Furst and Dibdin write/wrote beautifully, not to mention grammatically. For anyone who likes exquisite writing, true suspense and books that really should be made into films but never are, I would nominate the amazing sleeper I read a few months ago: Paris City Of Night, by a little-known writer named David Downie. Talk about craft! Paris City of Night--and Furst's or Dibdin's many fine books--won't sell a million copies in a day, but perhaps they should.

0385504225|4.0|This was a good follow on to the other Robert Langdon books !  I read it on my Kindle, which Amazon did a good job with the electronic version.  As with all the other Dan Brown books, read it as entertainment !
1573229725|5.0|Without a doubt, I can say that this ranks within my top 5 fictional novels of all time. It offers an intricate and deep plot, unexpected twists, and unlikely romance, and several truly interesting and compelling characters. Each of these elements is greatly accentuated by Sarah Waters beautiful writing style and utter mastery of the English language. Every sentence seems to be poetic and almost lyrical. I find that I sometimes get ahead of myself when reading it because I am so eagerly awaiting the next paragraph. I don't think any other book has held my attention as strongly or for as long a time as 'Fingersmith' did.<br />Yes, the book is long, but you'll not be able to put it down once you've begun reading.
0345477618|5.0|I love Star Wars. My life was forever changed that night when i was 3 years old and my father took me to local cinema El Emperador in Ponce, PR to see this movie. I can still remember the line to get in, the huge star destroyer passing over head, Vader, the droids, the cantina aliens, the space ships and the Death Star battle. I have been into scale modeling for over 25 tears, some of my first where Star Wars models, some I still prouly own. This book is the Holy Grail when it comes to backstage information on the development and shooting of the original film, is simply awesome, ass kicking, worth every single cent. If you love Star Wars do yourself a favor and buy this book right now!
B002NXPTDK|5.0|I bought this CD because I saw so many of My Zune Social friends listening to it. I played this Disc and allowed the awesomeness to just sink in... This is a truly great first effort with exceptional production. We have here a really nice collection of songs that take you on a little trip. Common gives a nice narrative throughout so that the listener can tell where Cudi is in his altered state of mind.<br />The lyrical content is pretty good with a few missteps that leave you scratching your head but other than that an extremely smooth listen. Best tracks for me are Cudi Zone(LOVEEEE this track)Alive, Enter Galactic (strange lyrical play ). This CD is at its best if listened to from beginning to end.
B00000D9TQ|4.0|I am not a Huge Phil Collins fan but i do like the man, not only as a singer but also as a composer, the guy is a great musician. This cd is really good when you have not a lot of space in your glove compartment for more discs and you want Phil to sound loud as you cruise around, or simply to relax back home. Is great music, full of musicianship and soul, recommended.

0743243153|5.0|With the opening line, \\"Life is difficult,\\" Peck begins this classic with what might be the most straightforward statement of all time. This book continues on with Peck's assessment of what it takes to lead a fulfilling life through responsibility, discipline and self control. It is well worth the money and I highly recommend it. I would add that Albert Ellis's book, [[ASIN:0879800429 A Guide to Rational Living]] would also be very helpful to you if this is the kind of book you would like to read.
B000001E21|3.0|This collection is a good sample of leppard's not so well know songs, some b sides and alternate versions of known hits.  Not all the songs are great but they are decent. What is truly missing is some rocking' b sides I do remmember from the Hysteria singles but is better than nothing, and they sound better here than in vinyl. It's not and awesome and complete collection but is ok.
076781214X|4.0|I adore this movie, flaws and all.  Yes, there are errors in the plot sequence and the filming.  Yes, there are obvious cheesy characteristics that don't seem to belong in a Coppola film; however, this is an endearing film that I have watched many, many times.  It never gets old for me.    The retro styling of this film is just part of the draw.   I also love the undertones of the film's theme:  what if?   I think most people look back at all of our stupid adolescent mistakes and wonder what would happen if we could go back and relive it.  Peggy Sue gets the chance, and finds that the choices that she originally made were not necessarily bad ones.  She and Charlie were drawn each other as teenagers, and even when she relives her high school years, she finds that the same is true.  She knows that he's flawed, and she also knows what the future will hold for them, but she couldn't deny that at that point in time, they were drawn toward each other for a reason.      Do things happen for a reason?  If Charlie would have sung a Beatles song, would it have been as popular?  Peggy Sue tried to alter some of the aspects of her life, but she also seemed to find that she was powerless to alter the major parts.  She could chase the \\"hip thinking\\" poet, but could she truly be happy with him?  Could she walk away from Charlie and find happiness with someone else, thus altering what she knew to be her future?    The plot is a bit hokey, but it does get you thinking.  If you did get a chance, would it really be all that different?  On one hand, you want to say yes, while on the other hand, we all know that time distorts our perception of things.  Would we really do it all differently if given the chance?  Perhaps not.  It maybe for this question alone that you'd want to watch this film with good friends and ponder that question.
B002BSHWUU|4.0|Enough has been said about the sound quality and the audio within.  Thumbs up for the box and packaging itself - the gatefold CD holders have top quality photos within and the booklets for each are terrific, held with staples rather than glue that will fall apart after a casual glance.

B000RIWAVW|5.0|When Halloween\\" was originally made people thought it would become a little known independent film that hardly anyone would remember thirty years later. Instead, \\"Halloween\\" has gone on to become the biggest independent film ever made and has made a niche for itself in the annals of Hollywood movie making. The movie was Jamie Lee Curtis' first feature-film role in which she was paid $8,000 and garnered her the name \\"the scream queen\\". Being produced on a measly budget of $320,000 the film has grossed over $47,000,000. \\"Halloween\\" centers around an escaped psycho named Micheal Myers fleeing an asylym who goes on a murderous rampage one Halloween night. He eventually descends the home in which the Curtis character is babysitting and wreaks havoc on her. The chills are a mile a minute, the suspence equivilent to \\"Psycho\\", and the direction by John Carpenter impeccable. The music score (also composed by Carpenter) is memorable for its piano medley. \\"Halloween\\" would go on to spawn other sequels and remakes, but this one buries all the others. This particular DVD edition features the film restored in pristine condition and includes the original trailer, is in widescreen format, has TV spots, and more. Look for \\"Halloween-The 25th Anniversary Edition\\" DVD that is available that contains great commentary by the producers as well as Jamie Lee Curtis. The packaging of that set is also original and innovative.
1565847032|5.0|\\"Well, Foont, Canada...\\"  That's the way many of his talks or in this case his responses begin.  \\"Well,\\" or \\"So in my view,\\" or \\"Look,\\" or even \\"This point has been understood forever, actually.\\"  In other words, the famous M.I.T. professor, the scientist, teacher, social historian and philosopher, reveals himself as an accessible human being who -- despite being one of the world's celebrated linguists -- speaks in simple, ordinary language.  Anybody can understand him.  He is not one of the speaking heads, the pundits, and neither does he direct himself to them: he is -- like Diogenese the cynic, or Socratese -- a street philosopher ready to mix-it-up with passers-by, for the sake of the soul of the City.<br /><br />This book is, as the Amazons say, a compilation of transcripts from his speeches and seminars given around the country over more than a decade.  Indeed, sewing the thing together must have been a challenge in and of itself, disregarding the constant hope that the spirit or breath of the speaker might survive and live within the patched-up and improvised body.  But, it does, somehow, though two or three times in the first half of POWER I felt myself skidding over what appeared to be ver batim repetitions of phrase as well as whole paragraphs, like rows of upraised sutures at the joints.  Distracting, but far from crucial.  Anyway, the editors post this notice on the back cover:  \\"FIVE HUNDRED PAGES OF EXPLANATORY FOOTNOTES COMPILED BY THE EDITORS WILL BE AVAILABLE ON THE BOOK'S WEBSITE, [...]\\"  Which means you can check anything he says at any point.<br /><br />Is UNDERSTANDING POWER worth reading?  I think so.  Is it entertaining?  I believe it is.  Is it informative?  Ohhhh yes!  What's the point?  The point is to wake you up, Neo, or Flaky, so that you can brush the scales from your eyes, \\"Rise and look around you, and you'll see who you are.\\"  And what you're part of.<br /><br />But rather than to describe further a book nearly everybody on the sitehas described adequately and in detail, let me offer you a snippet of Chomsky:  A man in the audience calls out, \\"It seems to me that in Canada, the fact that they have a labor party makes people somewhat more attuned to issues that Americans largely miss, like worker's issues for example.\\"  Chomsky responds, \\"That's right -- Canada's an interesting case.  It's a pretty similar society to us, except different somehow.  It's much more humane.  It has the same corporate rule, the same capitalist institutions, all of that's the same -- but its just a much more humane place.  They have a kind of social contract that we don't have, like they have this national health-care system which makes us look bad because its so efficient.  And that IS related to their having a labor-based party, I think.  The New Democratic Party in Canada (N.D.P.) isn't really a labor party, but its kind of labor-based.  However, that party's ability to enter the political system in Canada wasn't a result of having proportioal representation, it was due to the same thing that would be necessary to get any kind of change like proportional representation in the first lace: a lot of serious popular organizing.\\"<br /><br />You don't have to be any kind of scientist.  Anybody can understand what he's talking about.  His range of subject matter is wider than the questions and responses he's offered.  Animal Rights?  On page 357 it seemed for an instant he'd channeled The Buddah.  And (Fall down!) he did, namelessly, in spirit.  Newt Gingrich?  \\"Newt Gingrich and the rest of those people may talk about supporting 'family values,' but they actually want families destroyed -- because families are not rational from the point of view of profit-making.\\"  P. 363.  Welfare for the Rich as opposed to Welfare for the Poor, and what George Herbert Walker Bush called \\"The New World Order.\\"  He says, \\"What's been happenign in the contemporary period is really somethign quite new in history, actually.  I mean, in recent years a completely new form of government is being pioneered, one designed to serve the deveoping needs of this new international corprate ruling class -- it's what has sometimes been called an emerging 'de facto world government.'  P. 381.  And at about that point, near tne end, he brings us up to speed on the financial collapse we've only just narrowly squeaked by, and sketches its inevitable reprocussions, as we sit, terrified to find ourselves robbed of all our cash and awaiting the next move(s) of those few, invisible rich individuals who having stolen our money (Goldlman Sachs) will now rule our lives in fact.<br /><br />Unbelievable!
B001AVCFK6|5.0|9/8/66.  It's a badge that Original Trekkers wear proudly -- the date that the very first Star Trek episode (\\"The Man Eater\\") appeared on television.  I bear it, and Star Trek hooked me that very Thursday evening, and for the next three years, I sat through all 69 episodes, both the best (\\"Oh Boy! The Trouble with Tribbles\\") and the worse  (\\"Oh, no! Not that one!\\"). When they began to appear in syndication, I watched them over and over until I could repeat the lines with the characters.  And, no, I'm not going to tell you who my favorite character was.<br /><br />It's been 43 years since that first episode.  I'm still hooked.<br /><br />A lot of my compatriots have said that J.J. Adams' \\"reboot\\" of the Star Trek franchise went too far -- they weren't ready for some of the things that happened (and, for the sake of those readers who have not seen the movie, I'm not going to reveal what those things are).  They didn't like the changes in the mythos that occurred.  OK, fine.  Different strokes ...<br /><br />I, however, love this film, and would have gone to see it over and over again if it hadn't been that my darling didn't really want to (and our budget didn't allow it).  So what if things changed?  It's an alternate universe -- and any Trekker worth her salt will recognize those occur -- Remember \\"Mirror, Mirror?\\" A planet blows up, and I admit, given the planet, I'm pretty sad (no, it's not Earth).  I'm also sad that Scottie used Admiral Archer's favorite beagle for an experiment, and it hasn't been seen since (Okay, so one slipped out).<br /><br />However, the most powerful ideas and characters remain true to their alternate others:  Kirk is strong, handsome, creative in a crisis (and may be a womanizer, although he doesn't get the woman he wants here), even if he's not William Shatner.  Spock struggles to keep his emotions in check and his logic foremost (tremendously well-played by Zachary Quinto).  \\"Bones\\" McCoy (Karl Urban, unexpectedly unlike many of his fantasy and SF rolls)is humane, funny, and passionate -- and a lot better looking than the well-beloved, late DeForest Kelley. Bruce Greenwood (\\"The Core\\"), Simon Pegg, Ben Cross (superb as Sarak) and Winona Ryder (Amanda! And I am getting to be too old) are all wonderful, and add strength, passion and substance to both their characters and the film.  It was, however, sad to see Leonard Nimoy, as \\"our\\" Mr./Abassador Spock, late in his life, and know we probably never see him in another Star Trek film.<br /><br />So.  Buy it?  Damn straight.  Get it for your children and yourselves.<br /><br />Star Trek would have never died for me, anyway, because I've dreamed of walking on another planet ever since I saw that first episode.  But now, Star Trek will come alive for a fourth generation to learn those same dreams.y, and passionate -- and a lot better looking than the well-beloved, late DeForest Kelley.

B002C6K7N0|5.0|I've been wondering when Megadeth would make an album that not only returns to form, but can match and maybe even \\"conquer\\" the album rust in peace all throughout in every musical element...  Q: Does it conquer rust in peace?   A: You do not need to have an open mind to like the album at all, it's amazing on it's own. However, if you really enjoy analyzing the album, like myself, you will find that lyrically, vocally, guitar, drum, and bass wise it's pretty damn intricate, melodic, thrashy, technical,intelligent, sarcastic for a good reason, empowering, and most of all, the album is very MEGADETH. I FEEL that this album is the best representation of Megadeth's work, which is a concept that's hard to swallow for most fans. Why do i say this? it has a moving ballad, fast great songs, slow great songs, groovy, rhythmic, and even sometimes jazzy for those of us with an internal musical dork inside of us.    WHY I LOVE THIS ALBUM:  This album had elements of heavy in tone and production like \\"Youthanasia\\", The song-writing skill of \\"Countdown to Extinction\\", With riffs and intensity (tempo and rhythm) of albums like the first four(KIMB...ABIG, PSBWB, SFSGSW, AND RIP).                       But when you hear it, isn't there something extra from the last album?   When most guitar players and drummers hear this album, they will realize \\"Hey! Shawn Drover's drum parts sound even better tonally, and they accent the stringed instruments near perfection!\\". Another observation might be \\"Wow, Mustaine has really improved not only in lead guitar phrasing, but also in guitar-playing technique and vocal technique!\\" And I'd have to say these are all definite improvements from the last 4 albums, but what really makes it stand out for me, as a guitar player and musician, would have to be the fine work of ex- Jag Panzer and ex- Nevermore guitar virtuoso \\"Chris Broderick\\" who has left me dumbfounded on this one. His playing may be technical at times, but it is always MORE THAN FITTING tothe feel of the song.     I.E.- In the closing track on the album, \\"The Right To Go Insane\\", Chris Broderick plays a guitar solo that is not only enjoyable to listen to, but it actually captures the upset, angry, and empowering lyrics Mustaine has written about \\"workin' yer ass off\\" to still only have \\"nothing left to lose (or choose)\\". So insanity is inevitable, and the guitar solo following this lyric is perfectly showcasing this maniacal state of mind.          Lyrically, the album uses many literary elements like similes, metaphors, symbolism... and HOW these lines are read and performed are great as well (dynamics), because of Mustaine's humor, anger, sarcasm, and everything that makes Dave \\"Dave\\".          On the Bass guitar we have a ninja named James Lomenzo. He holds down the low-end very well on this album and does exactly what every rhythmic bassist should do: play the foundation of the song with the drummer; And well at that.       My criticisms of the album would have to be that i wish there were more tracks on it... The production is amazing too... (something i feel Metallica could learn much about from Megadeth) Kudos to Mr. Andy Sneap and EVERYONE involved in production, including Dave.     If you like the track head crusher on the album (the album's first single released in the U.S.), check out the music video on [...] or search on [...] for it. It's got a nice twist with many curves...         In closing, THIS ALBUM RULES!

B0029LHW4A|1.0|Get Born was a great album, fresh and rock solid; Shine On was a worthy follow-up which grew on me with each listen.  I've managed to endure Shaka Rock several times all the way through, and I can honestly say, there is not one song I want to listen to again.  I find I FWD a lot, and never RWD.  The hooks seem less edgy, more fluffy, and ultimately less interesting to me.  I\\"m glad some of the reviewers liked it, but I'm definitely in the camp of the disappointed.  Frankly, when I read all those raving reviews, it makes me suspect that those are record label execs trying to push sales.
B0010X745K|1.0|I feel like another dimension has opened and somehow filled the earth with people of very poor taste.  I cannot believe that ANYBODY would ever give this film more than one star.  What is wrong with you people?  What is wrong with Steven King and the poor idiots that funded this atrocity?    The acting is unbelievable as is the plot.  I could not stop watching it solely to find out if it could get any worse.  This is the only way it did not disappoint me.    The film suffers from acting that might have been slightly better if the actors were cardboard standees.  The only exception to this is the store clerk who actually gave a decent performance.  Characters integral to the early plot (the lawyer) suddenly vanish with no explanation whatsoever.  The characters act in ways that I cannot believe any humans in a similar situation would act (like when they begin to turn on all their emergency lights once they realize that the large stinging insects are attracted to the lights causing other, larger creatures to bust the plate glass windows in the grocery store.)  A study in human nature?  I think not unless you are handicapped by the shallowest understanding of humans possible.    But the biggest disappointment of this film came when I read the reviews and saw so many five star ratings.  Are you all insane?  Are your standards really this low?  I must look up your other reviews to see what your other opinions are.  I can only imagine that there are thousands of people who watched this abortion and did not bother to write a review leaving the toe-sucking sycophants like those who gave it five stars free reign.
B00000G3PA|3.0|Armageddon / B00000G3PA<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br /><br />If I were rating \\"Armageddon\\" based on the first 45 minutes or so alone, I'd probably give it a solid four stars, maybe even five. The movie starts strong, with a canny blend of immediate disaster and relevant exposition (as opposed to some disaster movies that force you to sit through 30 minutes of character set-up before you get a whiff of nature-turning-sour) alongside humorous character introduction. The triangle between father, daughter, and lover is an amusing one, and Tyler in particular shines as she balances a complex tightrope of emotions - distance and frustration, anger, worry, and a touch of amused contempt. The high note continues as the obligatory Introduction/Recruiting scenes start rolling, and the film is canny enough to drape everything in over-the-top humor - the men want to be reimbursed for their efforts by knowing \\"the truth\\" about JFK, having their parking tickets overturned, and being taken permanently off the IRS rolls. Even better, Billy Bob Thornton plays the straight man to all this and plays it well, highlighting the wacky fun and exposition.<br /><br />Unfortunately, about the time after lift-off, the amusing chuckles become less frequent. Frankly, the movie's biggest failing here (in my opinion) is the decision to put so much focus on Affleck. I've got nothing against the man as an actor, but the entire set-up with him being sectioned off with the crazy Russian astronaut solely and specifically for the purpose of him (a) ramping over the moon Dukes-of-Hazzard style and (b) climatically showing up at the last moment when everything has conveniently broken is just so much tedium and is far too long. Frequent shots back to Thornton and Tyler on earth are included here to heighten the tension, but without Willis to play off of, the shots fall relatively flat and begin to occur too frequently.<br /><br />Ultimately, \\"Armageddon\\" is a decent disaster film, and probably one of the best known, but I find I can no longer sit through the entire movie without fast-forwarding through a good deal of the filler middle. I can't help but feel that the final product would have been better if all the side stuff with Affleck had been cut - either such that he was never separated in the first place, or such that his trek back to the others takes place largely outside of the actual movie. I understand wanting to ramp off of moon cliffs as a director - after all, it's cool and it was also probably intended as comic relief - but ultimately I just feel that \\"Armageddon\\" is a little too long and a little too bloated at the middle, despite the strong beginning.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoller sit through the entire movie without fast-forwarding through a good deal of the filler middle.

0385504225|2.0|Some readers may be enthralled by Brown's use of the tattoed freek that has wonder powers but it gets old in the story real quick. Granted, Brown writes to the academic crowd as they say but when you use the word ESOTERIC in its main form and two or three variations 38 times in the first nineteen chapters, it wears on the reader. The viewing public is not William Buckley wanna-bees, they really don't want to run to a dictionary after every page. Readers of action thrillers want the story to flow, this one does not. Langdon constantly corects his fellow characters by the use of \\"actually, it really is,.......  ho hum. This will put you to sleep in five pages--especially when they start looking for the address in D.C  where the answer is supposed to be located. Also, lets stay realistic, if Langdon is sealed in his freeking vault, drowned with water and you can SEE him injest the water and then Brown just leaves him there and goes on with the story---hey??  Langdon is dead-kaput, the hero dies  before the end. Definately not as good as Di /Vinci. This is were we suggest that he (Brown) is getting more like Clancy---he may NOT be writing this--perhaps  fifteen writers meet each week with Danny and put the next three chapters together??? MAybe? Perhaps??  All we need now from Brown to REALLY copy Clancy is a video game to go with the story.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|I was more than pleasantly surprised with the audio quality this headset provided.  Well worth the $ if you don't own a surround sound system.

Very happy with my purchase.

1416583408|4.0|This book addresses an extremely interest subject, and parts of the book are quite well-written. Some of the information, like the biology of scent and vision, was interesting and useful. And there were some good stories about Pump, the author's dog.    But the book tried to reduce a lot of dog behaviors to biology and evolution. I did not find these attempts especially persuasive. Who's to say a dog does not have emotions at least as deep and meaningful as a human's?     I did not find this book was all that helpful either in trying to communicate with my dog. Some of the dogs the author talks about seemed a lot smarter than my dog. My dog mostly cares about food, and to some extent walking and barking at things. She does not learn a bunch of new commands like some of the dogs discussed. But at the same time, she is very charismatic, she is extremely good at convincing people to do things for her and also influencing people generally. She does all this in a way that looks simple, but isn't. She can figure out how to extract food from just about anyone, it seems.     At the same time, sometimes the author argues that certain remarkable behaviors my dog does are common. Well, maybe they are, but who's to say my dog does not do these for a remarkable reason? For example, I think it is quite impressive that my dog taught herself some words, notably \\"WALK\\" without ever being expressly taught them. Indeed she gets very excited when anyone says the world. I believe this to be rather impressive, even if the author says it is common. That is because the way my dog learned these was especially impressive, in my view, given how little else she cares about things.    Also, the book's discussion of the grace of dogs is a bit elliptical. I was not persuaded by a lot of the biological arguments. I think my dog moves in an amazingly graceful manner, and do not see how evolution requires this. I feel like the author would look at my dog and just see a lot of biology and evolution,rather than her special personality.    Nevertheless, the author seems heartfelt in her views, and there is information. The book design is of very quality, with a great picture of a dog on the cover.
B000VUQ4HW|5.0|I'd been reading about and hearing about this movie for as long as I can remember. And after watching \\"Shadow of the Vampire\\" with Willam Dafoe again playing the \\"elusive\\" Max Schrek,(and I still think he should have won the Oscar that year for Best Supporting Actor, thank you very much), I decided to finally buy Nosferatu.<br /><br />I held off for years because of reviews I read about poor video quality, bad transfers, etc.  All I can say about this issue from Criterion is that IT ROCKS!!!!  I'm not a big fan of black and white movies, much less silent films (Metropolis excluded). But I was very impressed with this one. The picture is crisp and clear, you see all of the great lighting nuances. It looks fantastic. And as for the villian, he is easily the ugliest, creepiest vampire ever. I don't know where they dug Max Schrek up from, but he was either one of the greatest character/method actors of all time, or \\"something else\\" entirely. Not that it matters.<br /><br />Now I understand why they tried to [...] his look in the original film version of Stephen King's \\"Salem's Lot\\" instead of sticking with the way King described his vampire in the book as starting out as an old gentleman gradually getting younger with the more victims he has his way with. I first saw that when I was very small, and the first time they showed \\"the monster\\" I bailed off the side of the couch and that's where I stayed to watch the rest of the show on tv.<br /><br />This version of Nosferatu is wonderful and well worth the money. I'm glad they introduced the original score back into it as well. It adds a lot of ambiance. I'm extremely pleased with my purchase of this wonderful classic film and I'm ecstatic that it managed to survive, despite the fact that all copies of it were supposed to be destroyed just because Bram Stoker's widow had her [...] in a wad over copyright issues.

B0025KVLUQ|5.0|Why it took me all of these years to finally become a fan of The Beatles, I will never know.  It could've been because when I was growing up my parents loved them, so I automatically assumed (stupidly, I might add) that I wouldn't like them.  So, I never really gave them a fair chance, and it was probably better that way because there is no way in heck I would've been able to appreciate them as a band back then as I do now in my late twenties.<br /><br />Out of all of their albums, \\"Abbey Road\\" has to be my favorite, and that's not an easy call to make when you have a band who has put out excellent albums one after another.  However, \\"Abbey Road\\" is the one I find myself listening to the most.  While there are great standalone songs, it's just a complete joy to listen to all the way through.  Songs can be fast-paced and upbeat like \\"She came in Through the Bathroom Window,\\" \\"Polythene Pam,\\" \\"Mean Mr. Mustard\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden,\\" and songs can take a more slow and beautiful approach such as \\"Something\\" and \\"Because.\\"<br /><br />While the entire album is excellent, I do have some favorites.  Those would be \\"Come Together,\\" \\"Something,\\" \\"Here Comes the Sun,\\" \\"She Came in Through the Bathroom Window,\\" \\"Oh! Darling,\\" \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" and the three part finale \\"Golden Slumbers,\\" \\"Carry That Weight\\" and \\"The End.\\"<br /><br />The 2009 Remaster sounds fantastic, although I must say that I do not have prior releases of the album to make a fair comparison.  If this is something you should get to replace your older copy of the album, I can't honestly answer that question.  All I can tell you is that this new release sounds outstanding to me, and even sounds better when played out loud.  Headphones are nice, but the real experience is to crank up this baby on a nice stereo system.  The mini-documentary included on the CD is a nice little addition.  It's short, but still fascinating to watch.<br /><br />\\"Abbey Road\\" is a masterpiece and has quickly become one of my favorite albums to listen to.  It really showcases The Beatles exceptional talents as songwriters and musicians.  If you're like me and never gave the band the time and day when you were younger, I highly suggest giving them another look.

B002KQ6BT6|1.0|This book was an utter waste of time!  The CIA? Come on -- if we're supposed to believe there was a threat to national security, then we're all supposed to be stupid, and it would have been the FBI in any event. Zachary? Just not believable.  And if Solomon could recover that quickly to get to, ascend to the top of and then walk down the spiral staircase from the top of the Washington monument, then he was a totally unbelievable character. Not to mention that the shower of shards only got to Ma'lakh?

0385504225|4.0|After reading the first 100 pages, I thought for sure that I would give this novel a five star rating.  The plot hooked me early and I read through \\"The Lost Symbol\\" in less than a week (fast for me).  While the rest of Dan Brown's story was still entertaining, he wore me down with inaccuracies and repetitions.  One of the first that jumped out at me was that of Harvard professor Langdon translating \\"Jeova Sanctus Unus\\" as the \\"One True God.\\"  Surely Langdon would know that his school's own motto is \\"Veritas,\\" meaning \\"Truth,\\" and that \\"True\\" would be a variation of that, not \\"Sanctus\\"/\\"Holy.\\"  And, in addition to his usual distorted theological points, Brown riddles us with puzzles -- too often repeated and too many.  Poor Langdon gets bounced around in so many different directions, that it's hard to imagine him staying sane.<br /><br />Even with its problems, however, \\"The Lost Symbol\\" fulfills its role as a smart and intriguing page-turner.  Brown's use of science caught my interest and whetted my appetite for more.  The only criticism I have of this aspect is that Brown used a scientific Deus ex Machina, \\"God out of a Machine,\\" to rescue Langdon from certain death by drowning.  It's one thing to have Langdon pull a Houdini, but replicating amniotic fluid in place of water to save him is a bit of a stretch.<br /><br />Also farfetched is Peter Solomon's resilience at the end when he escorts Landon down hundreds of stairs from top to bottom inside DC's most compelling landmark.  Considering both their ordeals, especially Solomon's, I can't imagine either of them being able to lift a finger, let alone traipse around Washington, DC.  Yet, in another way, I'm glad they did.  I got a tour of DC that I thoroughly enjoyed.  Certainly, this will make for a fascinating illustrated edition of \\"The Lost Symbol,\\" as well as a cinematographer's dream movie.<br /><br />This book I would rate more or less alongside \\"The DaVinci Code,\\" but definitely below \\"Angels and Demons,\\" \\"Deception Point,\\" and even \\"Digital Fortress.\\"  For example, Brown's use of Deus ex Machina to save David Becker in \\"Digital Fortress\\" is more believable.  \\"The Lost Symbol,\\" with its somewhat nebulous ending, opens the door for a fourth novel of Langdon's adventures.  And Brown has the skills to improve considerably on this.  Fr. Dennis
B002Q91AVG|5.0|I went to high school in the mid 60s so glee club was much more like a church choir than the cast of FAME in performance.  Don't get me wrong--I love it.  If it is this way, that is fantastic.  I can't understand if it is like this why it is not more popular in the school. Why would being a cheerleader be more popular than singing and dancing onstage like a top Broadway production?  The numbers are great and even if the characters don't move you, the numbers are great fun.  The characters are good though.  Right now we've just had the gay young man who is a glee member come out to his father.  We also have two deceptions going on as to being pregnant, the teacher's wife who really isn't and the head cheerleader who is blaming the wrong high schooler.  But perhaps my favorite character is the coach of the cheerleaders.  She is in a perpetual snit because there is even a glee club and is acting like a commando guerilla warrior to bring the glee club down.  She is hilarious.  Very well done series and very, very different.

B0026ICAOS|3.0|Note- this review talks about the brand new remade version of Children of the Corn that came out this year.  I believe this is the version amazon is selling.    The newer version of Children of the Corn can best be described like this-    The film is divided into two parts-    - the first 45 minutes of film which involves the man and his wife arguing and fighting while riding up and down the streets of Nebraska looking at corn and searching for any kind of human activity.    - the second half of the movie which focuses on the husband running through cornfields trying to escape the children who are relentlessly after him.    The ending is a pretty big disappoinment though because it ends on a note where you're left feeling like the writers didn't complete the story all the way.    Besides that, stick with the original Children of the Corn.  It's much better.

Or maybe \\"How Biological Processes at the Cellular Level Map to Multi-Cellular Beings Like Us.<br /><br />What we have here is a lot of true basic science, mixed with rants about research that ignores possible quantum effects, sprinkled with a few old, but interesting and somewhat surprising human study results, packaged with some of the author's personal biography surrounding how he arrived at his positions.<br /><br />This is not a textbook, but a majority of the volume is spent covering material that is most assuredly in textbooks; basic science that's likely not to raise an eyebrow on scientists of any stripe.  In fact, early in the book, the author says something akin to that the reaction to the book by most scientists is \\"so what?\\"  I'm not a scientist, but I'm a science news junkie.  I've listened to about every T.E.D. talk and never stop reading layman science books and magazines.  And my opinion is the same as Lipton's scientist reviewers: \\"So What?\\"  If this was your first introduction into material of this nature, you might get something out of it, but for me, nothing new here.<br /><br />Beyond the textbook science, another area which gets significant treatment is criticism of various sorts.  Lipton airs concerns about how research science is not paying enough attention to how quantum mechanics might help explain more about the biology.  I agree that scientists have a hard time abandoning an idea that has been the basis of their career, and we would be better off if that wasn't the case, but ranting about it isn't going to help. The author obviously doesn't like big pharma and doctors who see that as the only way either.  No argument here, but again, preaching to the choir.<br /><br />The style of the book is like a professor giving a lecture.  There's the presentation of the material, plus wishes, hopes, rants, and experiences the professor.  Some of the topics well correlated with the material, and some not so well correlated.  But the professor only has you for a few lectures, and he wants to get his position on the world across to you before you leave.  And for someone who claims to be a scientist, I'm surprised at how many points are \\"proven\\" using a single anecdote as \\"evidence\\".<br /><br />So what's left in this book after we remove the rants directed at researcher community, after we remove the textbook science, and after we remove the autobiographical segments?  There are a few references to older studies about human biology that might be interesting and surprising to some readers. There is an advertisement for his buddy's classes, that I consider shameful.  But not much else.  I didn't get anything about \\"Unleashing the Power of Consciousness, Matter & Miracles\\", but that was probably just the publisher anyway.  The book title is deceptive.  I can't believe this book sold as well as (I guess) it did.  They must have one heck of a marketing department!<br /><br />Dr. Lipton's writing technique is to set-up a flimsy straw-man and knock it down.  For instance, a lot of the book is about the old nature/nurture question.  Lipton sets up by saying \\"you are not your DNA\\".  Ok, I knew that.  I mean, we have alligator eggs that will change sex if incubated at different temperatures.  We have human grandchildren that are affected by a sustained food shortage of their grandparents.  He's preaching to the choir, and let me tell you, it's a long sermon if you don't need to be convinced!<br /><br />Besides \\"Biology\\", the other word in the title that might be considered somewhat accurate would be \\"Belief\\", because he does talk about the placebo effect and related material.  Again, the straw-man is \\"what/how you think does not matter to your biology.\\"  Huh?  Who believes that?!?<br /><br />Lipton mentions that the media takes liberties with causation, but I think he might look a little closer to home for examples.  For instance he says that certain unexplained things \\"defy Newtonian biology.\\"  It is possible that there's some kind of quantum process going on in some \\"amazing feats of physical endurance\\" or with \\"the ability to walk across hot coals without getting burned\\", but maybe not.  After all, Bill Nye the Science Guy walked across hot coals, no hocus pocus, just was trained by a fire walker and did it.  It seems like anything the author finds that is not well explained, somehow ties back to quantum mechanics.<br /><br />Sometimes the best biologists have been able to do is map-out a simplified version of how a process might work.  When Lipton finds a process that is not well-understood, he leaps to the conclusion that there must be quantum effects going on.  There very well may be non-Newtonian processes, but there's nothing he is saying that's even marginally convincing me.  He tries, in one case, to say that because a protein is used for both sex determination as well as RNA synthesis that indicates non-Newtonian action.  Well, I can use a screwdriver to drive a screw or as a pry tool, does that mean there's quantum effects there too?<br /><br />This book was an easy read, and with the biographical references and professor's lecture style, was not totally unenjoyable to read.  But the material is unconvincing and much of it is stale.  The title of the book is deceptive, and having an undisclosed advertisement in the book for a paid class by his friend is stooping pretty low.  If you want to read a book by an author that believes the mind is separate from the brain, there are many other, more up to date and more convincing books out there.  Keep looking.or instance he says that certain unexplained things \\"defy Newtonian biology.\\"  It is possible that there's some kind of quantum process going on in some \\"amazing feats of physical endurance\\" or with \\"the ability to walk across hot coals without getting burned\\", but maybe not.

B001RIY49C|5.0|This is a very nice quality plastic T2 endoskull for the price. At 14\\" it looks impressive as a display piece. The sound effects are pretty worthless and I think the red eyes would have been enough. The Blue-ray main feature is a great version. I'm not sure what some buyers expected to get for 115 bucks! An endoskull made of metal at this size can cost thousands! I highly recommend this Limited Edition collectors set.
0385504225|1.0|Dan Brown's book, The Lost Symbol, is poorly written jibberish. It is obviously written to sell as a screenplay. The character development is lousy; the story line ridiculous; the explotation of the Masonic Order is outrageous, and it is shameful that Brown is going to make millions off of this trash.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|My husband and I saw this movie when it was first made.  It inspired us to choose the theme song for our wedding dance.  Now, it is good to watch it again.
B000063DI8|2.0|i'm a big iron maiden fan, and while i do have all their studio albums,i have to say out of all of them, this has to be their least inspired. i really think they got back into form after their \\"brave new world\\" album. so if your looking for sweeping epic maiden songs you won't really find them on this album. it is at best just an average rock album.
B001E57SH8|5.0|Finally, a butane version of the tried and true Zippo.  What every good Scout should have.  When I was a kid, we had a Swiss Army Knife, Maglite, & Zippo (the fluid type).  It was a different world back then.  No microwaves, personal computers, internet, fuel injection, crack cocaine, or AIDS.  Cars had Holley 4 barrel carbs & glass packs.  The President's brother sold us Billy Beer.  Mr. Furley got all the ladies.  And Fonzie beat Mork from Ork with his thumb.      Just imagine how much easier it would be to start a campfire with one of these.
B000ASATZ8|4.0|Imagine wandering through an ordinary American desert... when suddenly vibration-sensing giant worms erupt from the ground and eat you. That;s the \\"Tremors Attack Pack,\\" which brings together all four movies from the delightfully dusty, gory and wildly bizarre cult movie series -- no pretensions, just good solid sci-fi/action.<br /><br />In the original \\"Tremors,\\" tired-hands Earl (Fred Ward) and Val (Kevin Bacon) are intent on getting out of the sun-baked, dead-end town of Perfection -- only to run afoul of a vast subterranean worm that sucks people down and eats them. Soon the entire town is being held hostage by these vibration-sensing \\"graboids,\\" which are strong enough to rip apart the town. Now the guys must get the Perfectionites out of the town without being eaten by worms.<br /><br />Six years afterwards, \\"Tremors 2: Aftershock\\" us to the embittered Earl, who is hired by the Mexican government to go graboid-hunting across the border. Helped out by dorky sidekick Grady (Christopher Gartin) and Burt Gummer (Michael Gross), Earl kills most of the graboids... until suddenly they mutate into two-legged, heat-sensing \\"shriekers.\\" The remaining humans find themselves cornered by horrible little beasties that are as tenacious as graboids... but much more mobile.<br /><br />\\"Tremors 3: Back to Perfection\\" jumps back to the town where it all started, now a sort of graboid tourist trap, complete with fake tours by \\"Desert Jack\\" Sawyer (Shawn Christian). But when graboids reappear, Burt is stopped from graboid-hunting by government agents who intend to protect the \\"oldest rarest endangered species of the planet.\\"  But there's an even more pressing problem: the shriekers have evolved into the final form: flying \\"ass-blasters.\\"<br /><br />\\"Tremors 4 - The Legend Begins\\" jumps back in time, to a dusty little western town that is practically deserted when someTHING kills the miners at the local silver mine. Its dandyish owner Hiram Gummer (Michael Gross) arrives to reopen the mine... but soon the remaining townsfolk find themselves facing a bunch of weird wormlike monsters (referred to as \\"dirt dragons\\") that rapidly grow into monsters. Do they abandon the town, or stand and fight?<br /><br />The \\"Tremors\\" movies were all written by people with excellent senses of humor, and a knack for weaving up suspense over something as minor as walking over a floor. The last couple plots suffer a bit from sequelitis at times, but each movie is liberally strewn with freaky mutations, orange blood'n'guts, chases across the dusty desert, strong smart women, and a truck full of survivalist food. Oh, and enough explosions to level the Rocky Mountains, including a fun scene with an antiaircraft turret.<br /><br />And there's plenty of excellent writing (\\"She said I couldn't handle life without the threat of global war... what kind of thing is that to say to a man?\\"), with an extremely quirky sense of humor (Earl and Val handle every problem, be it breakfast or suicide runs, by playing rock-paper-scissors). It's this tight writing and nimble sense of humor that keeps the \\"Tremors\\" movies from becoming yet another stale action movie.<br /><br />Michael Gross ends up being the reigning champ in this series, and while the gun-obsessed survivalist Burt starts a bit cartoonish, he ends up a well-rounded, hilariously practical lead (while doubling as Burt's dandyish ancestor). Fred Ward is great as the grizzled'n'grumpy Earl, while Kevin Bacon is outstanding as Val.  In fact, the cast of each movie is awesome -- Finn Carter, Helen Shaver, Shawn Christian, Reba McIntyre, August Schellenberg and Brent Roam all give especially good performances.<br /><br />While the third and fourth films suffer a bit of sequelitis, \\"Tremors Attack Pack\\" is a fun, slimy and suspenseful race through graboid-infested deserts -- a must-see for cult movie fans.ining townsfolk find themselves facing a bunch of weird wormlike monsters (referred to as \\"dirt dragons\\") that rapidly grow into monsters.

B002EWD08Q|5.0|The UK music press has created and destroyed so many bands over the years, that it's always best to take a \\"don't-believe-the-hype\\" approach.<br /><br />But three albums into their career, here's what we know:<br /><br />1.  Arctic Monkeys are the best British band of the new millennium.  (Sorry Franz Ferdinand, Editors, Kasabian, Kaiser Chiefs, etc.).<br /><br />2.  Alex Turner has the wit, intelligence, and vocal chops to be ranked among the best British singer-songwriters of the past 40 years - he's up there with the likes of Ray Davies, Pete Townsend, Paul Weller, Morrissey and Jarvis Cocker.<br /><br />3. \\"Humbug\\" is a major step in the band's musical evolution--Sheffield post-punk blended with the stated influences of Cream and Jimi Hendrix and produced by Josh Homme (Queens of the Stone Age) and James Ford (Simian/Alex Turner's side project The Last Shadow Puppets).<br /><br />The Monkeys delivered on the hype with their brilliant debut album \\"Whatever People Say I Am, That Is What I'm Not.\\"  They followed up with the excellent \\"Favourite Worst Nightmare.\\"  Now they've delivered possibly their best yet: a hard-boiled sweet called \\"Humbug.\\" Along with a new maturity, there's a familiar lyrical cheekiness, too, especially on tracks like My Propeller (\\"I can't get it started on my own\\") and Crying Lightning (\\"My thoughts got rude as you talked and chewed/On the last of your pick'n'mix\\").  \\"Pretty Visitors\\" is the track most like the Monkeys of old. And standout \\"Cornerstone\\" is a song of lost love and mistaken identities reminiscent of The Who's \\"Disguises.\\"<br /><br />Clearly, the cheeky Monkeys have evolved into grown up rockers.<br /><br />Bring on the backlash.
B002A4Q652|5.0|I liked this one, but I think I preferred the first one. April Rain is a bit less heavy, with a lot more of Charlotte's vocals. I would have liked to hear more male vocals along with Charlotte, as there were on Lucidity. Overall, this is definitely a good album.
B00164GDD2|3.0|its the same dvd as the standard my guess its cause it says tru 1080p HD, in gold. so maby my 720p lcd would just display it as standard even tho it looks alil diffrent but not 4 the better.
B000DBHXG0|5.0|I bought this movie for a xmas presents, so I have not checked to see if it works.  However, the movie was delivered in a timely manner.  I would definitely order from the seller again
B001QOOCTE|5.0|Stand By Me is one of my favorite songs. I enjoy listing to all of the different artists adding to the songs. I have given 2 more as gifts. I think this is one of the most brilliant albums done in a long time. Everyone who comes in the house when this CD is playing from my 82 year old father-n-law to my 6 year old grandson like it.
B001MW0J2O|1.0|[[ASIN:B001MW0J2O Merriweather Post Pavilion]]  I listened to the first track. OK, it was different, not new, but different (spacey). Then the second track...mmm...a little like the previous track; then the third....and beyond. I would say the one word that best describes this CD is \\"monotonous\\". I don't knew who they had as a producer...but they need to get a new one. I tossed my copy knowing full well I would never listen to it again.
B001GCUO16|3.0|i have the bootleg of the leaked movie nd this so called completed thing  the same thing the cgi is just as unfineshed as the leaked ver verry poor  looks cartoony in 1080p its hugh jackman with cartoon claws lol
B002KH4KSY|3.0|I love the original children of the corn film but this one leaves you wanting more. The problem with this one they leave out all the best parts that made the original so good. Plus the actor that played Isaac did not fit at all. John Fraklin who played Isaac in the original made him creepy. But Preston Bailey  makes Isaac out to be just a little annoying snot nose kid. The actor who played Maliki I thought was better but still not the best. Overall this film wasn't bad it just didn't add up to the original. They are suppose to release a unrated cut on October 6th maybe that will be better.
B000F3JVG6|5.0|This is a powerful novel of one man's search for the meaning of life in the early 1900's. Well written and touches one's heart. I highly reccommend this book. If you have a chance, see the movie staring Bill Murray of the same name, it's extremely well done.
B002GZQY6Q|5.0|I found this CD to be another twisted turn on the Porcupine Tree train ride. They once again didn't stick to the success formular of past recordings but go into another dimension , the musical adventure that is Porcupine Tree. It looks as if the metal phase is leaving and a more progressive tone is coming back. Steven Wilson has not rested on any one genre of music and this could have been his chance to sellout and go commercial leaving hoards of angry fans who saw that behavior with Genesis, Yes and Marillion. This CD doesn't have the ear grabbing hooks of past recordings but teases you into continuous listenings to capture your interests. The first CD starts off a bit obtuse but after the song \\"Yellow Windows On the Evening Train\\" the album picks up steam and bowls you over. The second CD is only 20 minutes and I'm not sure why it wasn't a one CD package. It was a nice listening experience all the same.

0743298039|4.0|The purchase of this book was just a gamble for me. I won!    The story is about a young woman, Margaret Lea, who grows up in a narrow world, surrounded by books, in her father's book store. She loves them and she loves stories. She writes critiques of books professionally. She is hired by famed, reclusive author Vida Winter, who has given many different versions of her life story, to write what she says is the true story of her life. Margaret moves into Vida's mansion, set in a wonderful garden. They meet daily to discuss Vida's life.     The characters are strange and their relationships are equal to the Gothic setting of the family home. Her family shaped her personality in a way that gave her gifts and left her with scars. She and Margaret are changed and liberated by exploring the events of her tragic life.    I found both stories fascinating.
B001V9LRV0|5.0|I am very pleased with this set. The DVDs are great and it has a lot of extras too. If you are a Woodstock fan, and a fan of music of that era, you should definitly add this set to your collection, you will not be dissappointed.
B001AQO41E|4.0|Most Blu-Rays are either great (The Road Warrior) or terrible (The Ninth Gate), so it's rare when I find one that underperforms juuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuust a little bit; even a Blu-Ray with virtually NO special features has a magnificent picture (The Dark Knight) or some other compensation.<br /><br />POLTERGEIST is one of these.<br /><br />The transfer is great.  I was 2 when it came out so I never got to see it as a big-screen experience and it is a revelation to see it as such: I liked this movie before and I LOVE it now.  However, the transfer's not the problem...it's the master.  I don't think they cleaned the film sufficiently when they struck the master because there's noticeable dirt and pinprick abrasions throughout the film: it's not terrible, or even plain bad...but if you are a videophile like me, it can be a bit unnerving.  The worst part is the living room scene where they first speak to Carol Anne: there's a series of faded vertical scratches through the middle of the screen throughout the entire scene...I would have hoped they'd notice that and paint it out, but they didn't.  Thankfully the scratches are thin and faint (and they don't show up again) so they're not unbearable, but they are irritating.  The film is grainy, but in the good way (1980s film stock wasn't as sharp as it is today) although some grains seem a little larger than others at times...but I can't prove it.<br /><br />As for special features, well, I think POLTERGEIST is never gonna have the special features it deserves due to the whole Spielberg/Hooper controversy, so I won't get my hopes up.  Basically the picture reminds me of first generation DVDs of classic movies (the first Road Warrior DVD comes to mind)...much better than VHS, but it could be improved/cleaned up.<br /><br />Colors, tones, blacks and all that other stuff seem to be fine.  Aside from the maintenance issue, I don't see any other problems with this transfer and at $20 right now is a great find.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|it's da vinci code all over again, only badly written, badly edited, and really boring. save your money.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|I'll say right off the bat that I wasn't a big fan of United Abominations. Mustaine created a kickass album in The System Has Failed - one of his best - and you'd be forgiven for thinking he couldn't pull off anything close to it again.    Endgame is excellent. One of the better Megadeth albums in terms of rhythmic energy and solo-ing. While some may not be a fan of Mustaine's recent songwriting style (after 24 years he's naturally not writing songs the same way as PSBWB or RIP)the songs are excellent for what they are: headbanging delights with subject matter that will hopefully at least make you think a little bit about what Dave is saying.    Shawn and James lay down a lovely solid rhythm section, and Chris' solos are probably some of the best on a Megadeth album since Marty Friedman's heyday. Dave's riffing is tight, fast and heavy. It's lovely.
0743298039|5.0|The Thirteenth Tale was a great story. It was chosen for our book club and all the women involved liked the story. It was a quick read with interesting twists.
B002BFIN6K|3.0|I am really disapointed that Sony dropped SACD, I was expecting this recording to be on SACD. The performance is superb.
B001H5X7JS|4.0|If you dislike a film that has foul language, violence, a pseudo amputee war vet, use of the word \\"retarded\\", Asian orphans depicted as demonic, trivializing drug addicts & drug lords, requiring some knowledge of Hollywood stereotypes and a higher attention span to appreciate some of the more subtle jokes, and/or a loose story line without a spectacular action packed, tear jerking ending, than this movie is probably not for you.    I had friends back from Iraq who understood the premise of the movie, but still found it distasteful and at the same time a Vietnam vet who loved it as it made fun of movies that he felt were \\"Too Hollywood\\" (including Platoon, sorry if some people find that hard to believe).    At a friend's house I witnessed the movie being stopped halfway through as a heated argument ensued between a mother (not offended by the film) of an adopted child from China essentially told my friend (a \\"special needs\\" teacher) to lighten up on the use of the word \\"retard\\" in the film. That night did not end well.    Okay, the point is there is nothing wrong if a person does not like the movie because it has something that offends him/her or that a person prefers movies with a tight script, consisting only of light hearted easy to follow humor, and/or a great Hollywood ending. But there is also nothing wrong if one likes this movie for what it is.    People who liked Ben Stiller's earlier films may find this one too extreme, but I found it a well thought out mockumentary of Hollywood's all out assault to exploit a story using pretentious actors/artists made famous from over the top commercialized characters.    This is highlighted when the \\"novel author\\" (Nick Nolte) of the film being made within this movie, boasts of how his \\"real life\\" story was chosen by Hollywood over all other decorated Vietnam vets stories.    The only problem with this is that his story is total fiction and underscores Hollywood's aversion to anything that sounds too realistic. Hence, whenever a movie says \\"Based on a true story\\", it really means 1% true story and 99% Hollywood Bling!    I can understand why some may not like/get this movie, but the one group of friends that I found that did like it, also liked Monty Python, Terry Gilliam flicks, Star Trek, and Family Guy. Go figure. So if you have similar likes, you will probably enjoy this movie.    In other words, if nothing from the afore mentioned offenses are of concern and one is willing to watch a film that follows more of an SNL script (albeit 2 hours long), then see the movie.    Also, make sure to see the Director's cut version (not the one that is only 106 minutes long).
0385504225|2.0|I don't quite see the point on commenting on whether or not Dan Brown is a good writer or not. Stylistically, he's fine. He doesn't say anything in a particularly nuanced manner, but he can clearly communicate plot and detail and for a book of this genre, that's all I need. But he's become so predictable. I love the earlier review that listed out the boring path most of the chapters took - there's always a character in the dark, and then, most conveniently, someone who's a friggin expert illuminates all, and then there's a startling realization that brings everything together as the chapter ends. Boooooo.    The biggest disappointment was that I figured out after about 20 minutes of reading what the 'pyramid' was going to be and if I, average American reader, can figure out what shocks Langdon to his core at the novel's end, then I do not believe Brown has lived up to any expectations of providing an exciting, unexpected, NEW, entertaining book. Honestly I should have just reread 'Angels & Demons' or that one he wrote that explains how crustaceans are just giant cockroaches of the sea. Now that was interesting.
B000RG1FMO|3.0|I remember first listening to Late Registration, possibly one of the greatest albums I have ever heard. I was excited to get Graduation to get more Kanye. I was not that impressed, the album definitely has more of a commercial sound(Stronger, Can't Tell me Nothing, Good Life, Drunk and Hot Girls). It's still a good album, but I love Lat Registration so much more.
B00275EHCI|3.0|It was an interesting movie.  I enjoyed it, although it is not one of those movies I would watch over and over again.<br /><br />Imagine a world in the future where surrogate robots are readily available to much of the population, probably middle-income and above.  The robots often even look like you, unless you want something different.  They look pretty much human, unless you tear a piece of skin and see robot-matter.<br /><br />Now, let's say that you have a debilitating injury.  Maybe you are a parapalegic and confined to a wheelchair since a bad accident.  Or maybe you are severly scarred and you don't want people to see you like that.  Maybe you are just unhappy with your appearance.  Maybe you want to keep your FBI-Agent job, but you can't run like you used to.  You can have a young, vibrant \\"you\\" act out the rest of your life.  As a matter of fact, your surrogate can run and leap and do things beyond the human scope.  If you are a woman, your surrogate can act out for you at 25 or 30 again.  (No, they did not discuss sex in the movie so I don't know the answer to that part, so don't ask me.:-)  You surrogate stays in a stand-up charging station when not in use.  To activate, you lay/sit, put these glasses on, and activate the surrogate.  Some people use the surrogate so much that they have no \\"real\\" life anymore.  They just live life through the surrogate.  As a matter of fact, that's pretty much all you see everywhere is the surrogate version of the person.<br /><br />Is this a good thing or a bad thing?  A technology that was originally intended to help folks with severe disabilities has become available to most people and has taken over their life (by their choice).  Well, some people think it's a bad thing and want to rid the world of surrogates.<br /><br />Bruce Willis plays an FBI Agent.  Interesting movie, as I said.  I enjoyed it.
B00007KWHG|2.0|My review is for the MP3 download version of this album.     It's not so obvious when listening on computer speakers that are very close together, or on tiny, tinny portable speakers that squash everything down to mono anyway. But when I tried to listen to this in my car, I couldn't stand the extreme separation, with Frankie singing alone from one speaker, and the Seasons on the other; or, instruments on only one speaker and singing by itself on the other speaker. This is NOT the way I remember the songs sounding years ago, when I listened to them on top 40 radio stations in my car.    It was so frustrating to me, and the rest of the reviews so positive, that it made me go to great lengths to make sure it wasn't an equipment problem on my end. I tried equalizer settings on my MP3 player. I actually got a new car stereo with many more audio controls, such as fade, balance, and its own equalizer settings. I tried playing it from CD instead of my MP3 player. Nothing helped.     I finally found some shareware called FX Audio Tools (there's a free trial period) which will let you convert stereo MP3s to mono. Finally, success!!! I'm glad to be hearing the songs the way I remember, but honestly, I resent having to go to all this trouble. I've already paid the record company to do the job of making it sound right and as far as I'm concerned they fell down on the job. However, I can see I'm in the minority, as the vast majority of reviews are 4 and 5 stars!
1416594787|5.0|I've read some of Richard Dawkins' other books and I think this is my favorite. It is well-planned and to the point. I've had a lot of \\"Wow! Really!\\" moments while reading this and can't wait to read the journal articles he used as references. Anyone interested in biology should pick up this book.
B0021L8UVC|3.0|Since the inception of \\"Alien\\", there have been many attempts at a cross-blending in genres of science fiction and horror. I guess there is just nothing scarier than being stuck in space with no place to run to. \\"PANDORUM\\" is a collaboration between American and German filmmakers to make a sci-fi horror film. Directed/co-written by Christian Alvart (Anti-Bodies) with screenplay by Travis Milloy, the film is full of slick European claustrophobic atmosphere that is a journey through the depths of the human psyche.<br /><br />In the far distant future, the Earth had become vastly overpopulated that humankind has resorted in trying to locate a new habitable planet. When a planet is finally found that closely resembled mother Earth, a gigantic ship called the Elysium is sent with its 60,000 passengers to inhabit the new world. Now aboard the ship, two astronauts, Bower (Ben Foster) and Payton (Dennis Quaid) are forcefully awakened out of hyper-sleep, they are disoriented with little memory of what had gone before save for their mission, as they find the huge ship seemingly with little power and no other crew members. Exploring the spacecraft, they find that something terrible may have happened that can affect the human race. Setting out to find answers and to reset the reactor, Bowers encounters other crew members (sexy Antje Traue and Cung Le are among them) who are fleeing from mutated cannibalistic inhuman creatures that are stalking the bowels of the ship. To make things worst, there is also the madness called \\"Pandorum\\"....<br /><br />\\"Pandorum\\" is directed by Christian Alvart, whose previous work called \\"AntiBodies\\" have impressed me; so naturally, I would be very curious to see how he manages to pull off a sci-fi horror film. The movie borrows heavily from other sci-fi horror thrillers such as \\"Event Horizon\\", \\"Eden Log\\", \\"Sunshine\\" and even the horror thriller \\"The Descent\\". The film brings about the horrors of space travel, the alienation and fear that can arise from it, and the collapse of the psyche. While most sci-fi horror films are basically a descent into a hellish journey, \\"Pandorum\\" also brings about certain \\"trippy\\" mind games aside from the usual perils of being killed and eaten alive.<br /><br />If claustrophobia has a name, it has to be Christian Alvart. The man definitely knows how to generate extreme discomfort and panic. The film has a manner in playing the right mood, feel and atmosphere to freak the viewer out with the isolated narrow set designs, the tight confines are easily felt by the viewer. It is easy to sympathize with the characters in their situation, the viewer is effectively brought into this world full of dark steamy corridors, wet and dank environment that has that ominous feel. The film is more of a haunted house experience than an actual monster-chase film, there are some nicely timed scares but it is rather uneven in its execution. There are several freaky images that provided its visceral impact, and I have to admit the film does manage to generate some decent suspense; hey, the film has several sequences of action and even blood and gore; yes, the old-fashioned type with little uitlization of CGI enhancements. The creature designs have that very pale-faced look reminiscent of \\"The Descent\\" with the \\"Mad Max\\" enhancements. Now that I've gotten that out of the way, it is time to breakdown the film's plot and screenplay.<br /><br />The plot itself is very interesting, the idea of making a perilous long journey has a lot of potential. It asks the right questions as to who...what....where?, and the viewer can easily become eager to see the resolution. The first half of the film starts off strongly, as I was very intrigued as to what happened to the crew. The explanation itself is credible enough, after all, we all know the theories of evolution. I also liked the sexy girl warrior Nadia (Antje Traue) and the stoic Manh (Cung Le), even the hunter leader (played by Andre Hennicke) is pretty creepy and intimidating. The place it falters is the way it structured the film, it seems to be taking its time trying to explain things, give the film a mythic feel, all the while trying to make it more complex than it really is. In a film set in outer space it is a good idea to keep the pace quick and tight, while keeping the viewer busy with scenes of raw emotion and suspense. I like emotions in my horror films, but this movie may just be too full of `in-your-face' emotions that some scenes felt a little too heavy for a film this predictable. The problem is, when there are no creatures the film almost stops to a crawl.<br /><br />Ben Foster (30 Days of Night) is pretty ok as the main protagonist, but I sure wished his supporting cast was more fleshed out. Dennis Quaid does his role with minimum effort. Nadia is the character with the most potential, but she was a little undermined with the display of human angst. There are also some underlying questions as to how long they managed to survive this long; there are also several holes in the script. (after all the mission log says that a certain amount of time had elapsed) Cam Gigandet (Never Back Down) has the most crucial role in the film, but I found his performance to be lackluster.<br /><br />\\"Pandorum\\" does have its fair share of decent twists and turns, the film started off strong but it began to wear thin as it went along. Alvart does try to add some needed intricacies to the film's otherwise predictable plot, but it felt a little too forced. Alvart did manage to provide some spooky atmosphere, freaky images and some good thrills, but the film felt very superficial. The movie is just derivative of other films in sci-fi horror. The climax felt more like a irrevocability than an actual resolution to the film's plot.<br /><br />Recommended timidly, Rent It first [3-Stars = Good, Flawed With Redeeming Qualities]it falters is the way it structured the film, it seems to be taking its time trying to explain things, give the film a mythic feel, all the while trying to make it more complex than it really is.

0790731509|3.0|I guess I was less enamored with this film than most reviewers. Paul Newman, of course, turns in his customary bravo performance, but at the end of the day many viewers will have difficulty identifying with the protagonist of this film. (Paul Newman, as &#34;Luke.&#34;) Luke has a two-year sentence at hard labor, and seems to go out of his way to make things difficult for himself. The terrible truth of prison life is that the guards and administration have absolute power over you, and prison is accordingly no place to try to assert individualism. That is the basic moral of this not-uplifting story but Luke cannot seem to get this notion through his head.<br /><br />This one is probably a realistic portrayal of 1950s era prison life. But it is not a film I would care to watch more than once. RJB.
0385504225|5.0|The thing you need to remember, is this is a work of fiction.    It should be judged against OTHER works of fiction, not just judged against The DaVinci Code.      The DaVinci Code was a great book because it let our imaginations run free and made us rethink how we view so many things.    I do not think this book was as good as The DaVinci Code, but I still give it a 5 because it is, ON ITS OWN, a very well done work of fiction.    It is quick paced and there's a few nice surprises in there, though one which the reader could tell was coming the whole way out.    I enjoyed the Lost Symbol, and recommend it-  not as a LIFE ALTERING work, but as an very solid read which will make you smile some and rethink the USA a little bit.    One reader said that the \\"lost symbol\\" revelation at the end was wrong because it was faith specific and \\"in front of us, but we can't see it\\"-    I think by reading words of Peter in the book, you see it's very much NOT about faith, and the whole point is the thing you think is right in front of you, you're actually looking at incorrectly.
630542828X|4.0|There is a lot in this film that rings true regarding big-time (or any) civil litigation.  What resonated with me is the fact that the protagonist law firm really busted its tail for its clients, and ultimately the clients were not grateful.  Show me the lawyer who has not experienced this!  The film's depiction of the ungrateful lead client is priceless.<br /><br />Travolta is outstanding as the motivated plaintiff's attorney, and Robert Duvall turns in his customary excellent performance as the Beatrice defense counsel.  There are apparently significant differences in Massachusetts rules of civil procedure from those in California (where I practice).  The problems that the plaintiff had as depicted in the film would not occur here.  (No more details for fear of spoilers.)<br /><br />Overall, this is an accurate picture of some of the dynamics of contingency civil litigation.  If nothing else, it educates the viewer as to why most civil litigation is not done on a contingency basis, contrary to what the public often perceives.<br /><br />I enjoyed this one and would watch it again, but this is not an uplifting film, which is too bad.  RJB.
B000F4LPJ6|3.0|I watch alot of movies, and I have watched quite a few Japanese movies... I'm not sure why so many people rate this movie highly, except that it has an audacious premise (a highschool class forced to fight to the death).  First, the premise of the Battle Royale is given cursory attention... apparently spanking kids no longer works so teenagers just run wild with no consequence while adults suck it up.  To punish these out of control teens, a law is passed where a random class if forced to fight to the death.  But, for what purpose or point?  When the kids wake up from being drugged, they have no clue what is going on.  If the Battle Royale was suppose to be some kind of means of warning to teens to behave, why wouldn't these teens have realized right away what was going on?     The overall production values were mediocre, the acting over the top, and massive plot gaps abounded.  I guess people equate this as some kind of cinematic equivelant of Lord of the Flies or something, but it is really much much less.
1416594787|5.0|To those who have studied Biology in-depth, the evidence for Evolution as outlined in this book comes as no surprise. There were a few proofs (such as proteins and rabbit immunology) that I was unfamiliar with from my time in College.    The interesting point, I think, is that the fossil record is not considered as the hallmark of the proof of evolution, but rather as an interesting bonus. Dawkins makes the point - and backs it up - that even if the fossil record did not exist there exists overwhelming evidence that Evolution is a fact.    Dawkins eviscerates the arguments put forth by creationists, and they will be hard pressed to counter the arguments outlined in the book. (But anyone with a background in Biology already knows this).    The book will probably be read only by those who already have an understanding of Evolution, and this is a shame. It should be read by everyone. Those who already have an understanding, and of course, those who do not. No argument to \\"teach the controversy\\" (There is not one as Dawkins points out in the book) can survive against the factual evidence.    If you are curious about all the myriad of details about Evolution, then you need to read this book, as it will bring you on a wonderful tour. The inclusion of the color plates is a wonderful addon to the hardcover edition - and makes the book all that more engaging.    You owe it to yourself to read this and gain a good grounding in one of the most important ideas in science. And perhaps a copy for those people you know who don't have as good of a background.
0670020745|5.0|Jill Taylor's poignant recollection of her experiences as a stroke survivor illuminates just how resilient and adaptable the human brain really is.  Taylor expertly recounts the harrowing moments when she was suffering from a hemorrhage in the left hemisphere of her brain including the experience of losing the logical and linear control the left hemisphere has over our own perception of our selves.  She chronicles in a simple yet scientific language how she was able to recover her cognitive and physical abilities through her own tenacious will to recover and the loving aid from doctors, family and friends.   My Stroke of Insight is worth a read for anybody, but especially for those who have dealt with stroke survivors before.  Taylor provides a fresh perspective towards the healing of stroke victims which is underlined by her extensive knowledge as a neuroscientist.  The book has just enough illustrations to highlight some of the more complex explanations regarding the anatomy of the brain as it relates to her specific brain injury.    Taylor uses an almost conversational tone to relay her story to the reader.  This tone, while not what I was expecting works in that you feel that Taylor is sitting down with you and discussing her story directly with you.  I believe that this particular stylistic choice works, especially once you understand just how her brain was affected.  By midway through the book I felt that this story was written by the left brain in order to describe just how the right brain was able to function throughout Taylor's recovery.  Also, the inclusion of sporadic illustrations and Taylor's abilities to describe complex neurological functions in a nonscientific language allows easy access to all readers.  The Beginning   Taylor begins the story with three very important chapters involving her life before her stroke, and some scientific information regarding brain anatomy, the mechanics of a stroke, and the asymmetry of the brain hemispheres.  Thesechapters allow the reader to see who Taylor was before the stroke and provides enough scientific background to understand just how and why Taylor was affected the way she was.    The Stroke   The next three chapters describe in detail the morning of Taylor's stroke.  Taylor effectively conveys the breakdown of her cognitive abilities as blood seeped into her brain and drowned the neurons of her left hemisphere.  The reader is able to see in horrifying detail how the loss of the left hemisphere can amplify sensation and affect how we can control our own body.  One of the most interesting descriptions Taylor provides is how she lost the ability to be aware of her body in three-dimensional space which in her words was like being \\". . .released from that restrictive circuitry, my right hemisphere relished in its attachment to the eternal flow\\"(Taylor, 71).   It is also in these chapters where we are able to see just how the left hemisphere of our brain affects our daily lives.  When Taylor lost the function of her left hemisphere she lost the ability to perceive 3-d or even distinguish one shape from another.  She was unable to speak, read or understand language, and could not differentiate the different sounds coming into her ears.   But to me the most interesting cognitive loss that Taylor described was the loss of linear comprehension.  Taylor could not comprehend the future or the past, and only existed in the present.  Recovery   The aspects of Jill's recovery, though to me not as scientifically interesting, provide the emotional meat of the story.  Taylor chronicles how, with the aid of her mother G. G., she was able to gain back the physical and cognitive abilities she had lost.  What is interesting about Taylor's recovery is that she does not describe it as recovery, because she believes that she became a different person after the stroke, because she was able to choose which aspects of her left brain she wanted to recover.  She also details how every minor accomplishment was a major milestone in her recovery, and how those who are caring for stroke survivors need to be aware of this as well.  Quotes  \\"Yelling louder does not help me understand you better!  Don't be afraid of me. Come closer to me.  Bring me you gentle spirit.  Speak more slowly.  Enunciate more clearly.  Again!  Please, try again!  S-l-o-w down. Be kind to me.  Be a safe place for me.  See that I am a wounded animal, not a stupid animal.  I am vulnerable and confuse.  Whatever my age, whatever my credentials, reach for me.  Respect me.  I am in here.  Come find me\\"(Taylor 75).  At the hospital shortly after her stroke.  \\"By breaking the effort of sitting upward, I found regular success along the way--and celebrated accordingly--with sleep\\"(Taylor 93). Concerning her recovery.  \\"I celebrated the joy I felt and the lessons I had learned.  I was touched by the daunting reality: I was a stoke survivor\\"(Taylor 114).  After surgery.   Again this book provides a wonderful inside look into the mind of a stroke victim, by using a conversational tone which can be enjoyed by both the trained neuroscientist and the lay person.  I would heartily suggest this book to anyone who has been affected by stroke, and to those who are looking for an interesting perspective on stroke recovery.
B002C6K7N0|4.0|Amazing album from Megadeth but like the title say no suprises here. Dave Mustaine and the guys worked their butts off to make this record and it comes through. Every song on this album is so well written, played and sang. My only complaint is some of the songs should've lasted longer.
0061673730|5.0|At first the book goes back and forth and it can seem dull or uninteresting at times. However, if you stick with it you see the forest instead of the trees and really appreciate the character development. The intriguing moral story behind it all is thought-provoking, relevant, and deeply personal to everyone.    I have already recommended this book to three people, and whether or not you like philosophy, fiction, self improvement, or anything thought-provoking you will enjoy and benefit from this book.    Absolutely worth keeping this one around!

B001NFNFNU|5.0|I can't remember the last time I have seen a movie so well put together and detailed as \\"Changeling.\\" It is a haunting story of tragedy, strength, hope, courage and faith. Angelina Jolie (who I was never a fan of until I saw this picture) was amazing. She emoted the type of rage and anger that any mother would feel if this happened to her. But instead of just a regular movie \\"Changeling\\" is so much more. It was like watching a period motion picture straight out of the nineteen-twenties. The movie is absolutely riveting and fascinating. But it's also incredibly disturbing and haunting. Like a good book, this movie will get into your mind and cause you to think. I had to watch the DVD in 3 different sittings because it was so shocking. The scenes in the hospital were especially poignant because it was mixed with both tragedy and triumph. My favorite part was when Carol (Amy Ryan) gave that bigot doctor a good punch right in the face. John Malkovich was absolutely fantastic as Reverend Gustav Briegleb, playing totally against type. Although the movie is rather long (more than 2 hours) it does not drag on at all. This is the type of movie that is so tragic you will likely cry, yet there are even parts that may make you shed a tear of joy as well. Christine Collins never gives up faith because as she explained that was all she had. And as I watched her never for a moment did I think that I was watching the most famous actress in the world. Instead she was just a mother seeking justice.
B000PC0U1W|5.0|When this movie first came out, we were still in the middle of George Bush's 2nd term and the war in Iraq was not going so well.  So many people, including myself, viewed this movie as Left-wing propaganda in Great Britain projected onto the political climate in the US.  In fact, I hated the film, as it portrayed the terrorist as the good guy, or maybe in this case, the anti-hero.  BUT, as I rewatch this movie in 2009 with now ~9 months of the Obama Adminstration in charge of America, I see this \\"fascist\\" portrayal of the UK as more of a reflection of the current Obama Administration.  YES...I said it.  The Obama Administration.<br /><br />As we see in the movie, V's overall motive and theme is \\"People should not fear their government, the government should fear its people.\\"  Sure, the Hitler-like and militaristic methods of the UK government in this film are a bit \\"right-wingish\\" imagery (which I'd argue is incorrect on the fact that Nationalized Socialism is anything but \\"right-wing\\"), BUT that aside, the policies of this UK government, like the stiffling of free speech, especially the comedic bit mocking the chancellor (oh, where have we heard that title before?  1936 Germany perhaps?) is exactly like what the Obama Adminstration is doing these days.  One example being telling a health insurance company to cease and desist their advertising campaign regarding the possible cut to Medicare.  Umm, First Amendment rights violation right there.  I don't care if the ad is correct or not, they have a right say it.<br /><br />And in the end of the film where we see a \\"mob\\" of people dressed in V's cape and mask ascend to the Parlimentary building to watch it blow up.  This is remanescant of the 9.12 March on Washington.
B0011UF79C|2.0|Make no mistake, \\"Gattaca\\" is a science fiction film with a vitally important message.  It would have made an outstanding episode of \\"The Twilight Zone\\".  But for a two-hour feature film, the story feels so padded that I had great difficulty staying awake through the recycled scenes and massive amounts of Michael Bay-style sap that spent too much time affirming the audience that they are perfect just the way they are.  In spite of it's intellectually sound premise, the film ends up insulting the audience's intelligence with populist tripe when it should have taken on a much darker, grittier tone.  The film has it's (legions of) fans though, so if you have ever questions about whether or not human genetic manipulation is something we should explore, then I'd recommend checking this out. You'll probably like it. But if mainstream Hollywood's penchant for talking down to the audience makes you clinch your teeth, pass it up and get back with [[ASIN:B000UD0ESA Blade Runner]] instead.<br /><br />The premise of \\"Gattaca\\" is a future utopia where humans are able to be genetically engineered.  This is to say, that parents can shop for their offspring's biological traits as one would select features on a custom-designed automobile.  Innocent enough according to most people, but those of us who think these things through know where that will inevitably lead.  This is a story about that inevitability.  Ethan Hawke plays an abused minority in the film; he was born naturally through sexual intercourse the way we all were.  This makes Vincent what is referred to as an \\"Invalid\\".  \\"Valids\\" are those who had their makeup determined for the strongest and most genetically superior traits.  How can a random smattering of parents' DNA with all of the intrinsic flaws compete?  It can't.  Hawke's character is not only gnerally physically inferior, but he was born with a heart defect that all but insured he wouldn't live to see 30.  But he did.  Being a stubborn underdog we can all root for,  he is bound and determined to realize his dream of being an astronaut.  But given that every Valid on the planet is physically better qualified, people like him are only allowed to perform menial labor.  Legalized worldwide apartheid with no constitutionally unsound ramifications.  The idea bears a striking resemblance to some of the practices of Communist.  It's a simple system of picking the best people for the job so technically it's not discrimination.  No morality involved.  At all.  Hitler's vision of a Master Race is just around the corner.<br /><br />Great idea for a film, no?  Sadly, I found the execution lacking and the film had trouble keeping my attention once the premise was established.  Shots of Vincent gazing longingly at the sky as rockets take off for outer space while he mops the floor are almost humorous to a cynical bastard like myself who gets his jollies blowing spitballs at such storytelling practices.  The backstory where Vincent's younger brother (a Valid; the parents didn't want to make the same mistake twice) lords his superiority over him and then loses in a swimming contest is reiterated over the course of the film again and again in such a manner that I felt that the filmmaker was treating me like an idiot.  Yeah!  I get it!  We don't like the super-people so we revel in the guy who is just like us winning.  No need to show us four more times!  I about turned the film off when his ability to outdistance his physically more able sibling is explained by Vincent by saying he never saved anything for the swim back.  But his brother never made it to the swim out so what was he saving exactly?  So all that does is give the people a line that makes no sense to cheer about.  \\"Yeah, you fascist jerk!  He didn't save anything for the swim back except that he not only had enough to swim back, but he carried your sorry behind with him so obviously he did save something...  more then you in fact since you were the one drowning. Wait, what'd hesay again?\\"  Things like that eat at the inside of my brain and make me angry that the writers and director can't even think through their own story for our benefit.  They just assumed we'd be too dumb to care.  This is not [[ASIN:B000VR0570 Transformers]], damn it!  If you're going to make a cerebral film with no action at all, get your stuff straight!<br /><br />The vast majority of the running time is spent watching Vincent cover his genetic tracks as he enacts a plan to join a space mission by posing as a Valid by borrowing the identity of a crippled athlete.  He has urine samples, nail clippings, hair, fake ID, and everything else to pass the constant genetic screenings.  The screenings and the fervency of those involved seem to indicate that the innocent \\"best person for the job\\" ideology has evolved into outright racism.  Along the way, our everyman courts a Valid played by Uma Thurman, who looks extremely genetically superior in this.  Seeing Vincent dust his skin dust off of his keyboard and enact successively more complex plans to bypass the system got old to me quickly.  I didn't much care about him nailing a hot Valid chick either. After a while, I just wanted the movie to be over already.  we all knew how it was going to end from the second he looked up at that rocket.  The rest was filler.  Very sappy filler.<br /><br />As far as using film for a device to explain a complex subject such as genetic tampering, \\"Gattaca\\" is a triumph.  But seeing that I already was well aware of the social ramifications of such a practice, I have to judge it based on how the story affected me personally.  It didn't.  The devices were hackneyed, the characters were boring, there was no visual feast to pull it out of the fire.  As nice as it is to think that no matter what, the way we do things is always the best, the fact is that once we open that Pandora's Box, Invalids will be exactly that.  Invalid.  It's always fun to see David beat Goliath, but a more realistic take would have been appreciated.  Take [[ASIN:B0021L8US0 District 9]], for example.  When the underclass was abused and treated as animals, that's practically what they became.  Seeing something like that mirroring the real-life hardships of apartheid would have been much more convincing then the schmaltzy approach taken here.<br /><br />2 1/2 stars, rounded down for blowing a great opportunity.Things like that eat at the inside of my brain and make me angry that the writers and director can't even think through their own story for our benefit.

It's clear why these scenes were cut. They're boring and melodramatic, and a major drag on the rest of the movie. However, they better explain the weird behavior of Sibylla in the second half.<br /><br />The one thing I liked about the director's cut was Balian's sword fight with Guy at the end of the movie. I don't remember that happening in the theatrical release, and it tied up Guy's thread of the storyline nicely.<br /><br />The theatrical release would get 3 1/2 stars from me. It's shorter and therefore much faster, and there's less melodrama, less grainy slow motion battle scenes overlaid with melodious vocal tones, and less obnoxious populistic speechifying by Balian. However, in the 150-minute theatrical release, there is some measure of these elements, so be forewarned.<br /><br />What really holds the movie down is the inexcusable choice by Balian NOT TO KILL GUY. It's clear that once Guy takes control of the army, he's going to instigate a war with Saladin, which will result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and the possible overrun of Jerusalem. Balian is given an offer by the still-alive King: Lead the Army, and we'll kill Guy and the Knights Templar who refuse to serve under you. Balian refuses the offer, giving no deeper reasoning other than, \\"I cannot be part of that.\\" I can appreciate that he is a moral man, but this is taking it too far. The consequences of his idiotic action are immediate: WAR! Instead of getting his hands dirty with a few dozens lives, hundreds of thousands are killed, and Jerusalem is overrun. The anger of Sibylla towards him is TOTALLY justified. How they reconcile in the end is beyond me.<br /><br />If you're able to get past this major shortcoming, I highly recommend the theatrical version.m is TOTALLY justified.

B000ELJBAA|5.0|I was and am a huge fan of Gilmour's first album, which came out right when the Columbia started distributing music videos to the record stores (pre- MTV) where I worked at the time.  About Face is a natural transition and fills the blank between David Gilmour and the later Pink Floyd releases (Momentary Lapse of Reason & The Division Bell) as well as On an Island.  His solo work is incredibly refreshing.  I highly recommend  About Face and David Gilmour.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|Facts are ok, plot is good but not great, action is alittle on the slow side, the ending was also a meh, and the characters were good.   However, the only thing that keeps this book from getting 1 star is the moments in the book that make you think, &#34;ooooh, that makes sence,&#34; or moments when you think, &#34;oooo, thats clever,&#34; or even, &#34;Wait.....what???&#34; this is probably Dan Browns worst novel yet, but if your a fan of him, juat hurry up and read it, purely for the sake of getting it over with.   ALL IN ALL, JUST GO READ IT.     :/
B002GZQY6Q|5.0|At first, I wasn't too crazy about this album but with a good pair of headphones and a several full listens one can really start to appreciate the direction PT went with this album. Although more melodic and slightly more electronic driven than the previous records, this album delivers. From the ambience of \\"Drawing the Line\\" to darkness of \\"The Incident\\" to the simplicity and beauty of \\"I Drive the Hearse\\" PT brings another incredible album.    People give this album more time! It does not necessarily \\"hit\\" you right away, but it will grow on you!
0061766089|3.0|Design by Change starts with the premise that innovative breakthroughs of the past have been almost universally adopted.  This means more and more products and services are struggling to differentiate from similar ones.  More and more products are becoming commodities with the price being the only competitive advantage.  This is not a sustainable business model.<br /><br />Tim Brown continues with, \\"What we need is an approach to innovation that is powerful, effective and broadly accessible, that can be integrated into all aspects of business and society, and that individuals and teams can use to generate breakthrough ideas that are implemented and therefore have an impact.\\"  This he describes as Design Thinking.<br /><br />Design Thinking does not offer incremental improvements but a totally different approach to solving problems and creating new products and services.<br /><br />The book is divided into two parts. The first section answers the question: What is design thinking?  Part two is about where we go from here.<br /><br />The book appears to have two basic themes.  One is to tell the story of Design Thinking. The second is to tell the story of IDEO, the innovative design company run by the author.<br /><br />There are some very good lessons in the book and some innovative concepts.  Brown suggests that the job of design thinking is not fulfilling manifest needs by incremental improvements but it is helping people articulate the latent needs they are not even aware of.  He cites the example of Henry Ford, \\"If I had asked my customers what they wanted, they'd have said a faster horse.\\"  Design thinking is based on \\"insight, observation and empathy.\\"  It is understanding the future needs that the prospect cannot fully articulate.<br /><br /> Brown gives plenty of examples of design thinking.  He also gives a sound warning about getting too attached to our own ideas.  In design thinking we must be open to lots of ideas and not invest too much in any one idea.  \\"The greater the investment in an idea, the more committed one becomes to it.\\"<br /><br />Brown goes on to suggest that, \\"An organization that commits itself to the human-centered tenets of design thinking is practicing enlightened self-interest.  If it does a better job of understanding its customers, it will do a better job of satisfying their needs.\\"<br /><br />The book has some good ideas.  However at times there is a bit too much emphasis on promoting IDEO.  Also it is a bit disjointed in places.  It does not flow as smooth as it could.  The writing is a bit strained in sections.<br /><br />The intent of the book is to inspire business to embrace the concept of Design Thinking at all levels and in all phases of the business.  I believe the message was diluted by focusing too much on IDEO and too little on the theory and application.<br /><br />Some good ideas but you will need to wade through a lot of pages to get them.more committed one becomes to it.\\"      Brown goes on to suggest that, \\"An organization that commits itself to the human-centered tenets of design thinking is practicing enlightened self-interest.

Whether its about humans, vampyres, or even Bram Stoker's Dracula, I love romance, and this is the kind of book that would make you want to cry and laugh at the same time! Never had I read such a book that made me feel like I was the heroine, yet as I turned the pages of the book, I didn't feel like I was in my small town in California, I felt like I was actually Elizabeth and I actually was in love with Darcy! I would reccomend this book for everyone who is tired of their boring life and want to escape to the wonderful land created by the wonderful and glorious Jane Austen!
B002GZQYMK|4.0|When Muse first cracked the charts in the States they were often compared to Radiohead and, indeed, \\"Time is Running Out\\" was the best Yorke-inspired single with a backbeat since \\"Idioteque.\\" But I always thought Muse was more akin to early Queen, and their newest album, The Resistance reinforces that position with operatic choruses and grandiose piano-based sweeps.    The Resistance is a sturdy follow-up to Black Holes with passages that swoon and rock with confidence. Matthew Bellamy, the band's guitarist, pianist and songwriting genius, is in full rock-god mode, and the band's prog and circumstance style has never been crisper.     Opening song and single, \\"Uprising\\" is clearly built for stadium sing-alongs and the title track could make Freddy Mercury rise from the dead to play along. As with their previous efforts, the band changes moods constantly, shifting from melancholy blues (\\"I Belong to You\\") to crunchy rock quarries like \\"Unnatural Selection\\" that brings back the sprawling riffs and pace changes of \\"New Born\\" from three albums ago.    Bellamy's bleeding heart lyrics have always been best served for his bleeding heart tales of love's labour's lost rather than liberal agendas as evidenced here with the floating turd that is \\"The United States of Eurasia.\\" Otherwise, his phrasing is concise and his leads super tight to support the ever-changing cadences.    The beauty of prog rock is the pompousness of the style, and Muse has always shot for the over-the-top notes, usually to great success. This album would be their defining moment had they not indulged in a turgid closing act of a \\"song\\" called \\"Exogenesis\\" that plays out in three parts with a beginning, no middle and no end. Thirteen minutes of a classic suite with no intensity was a daring, but ultimately dreary way out of what could have been the best album of the band's career.     Take that composition out of the equation, and this then becomes the best EP of the Muse's canon.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|Seeing the Blu-Ray Guide of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs makes you really wish you had a Blu-Ray player. Besides the high-def version of the video and 7.1 sound, there are not one but two blu-ray discs loaded with extras to wet the most demanding appetite for details about Disney's first movie: three games, four backstage documentaries along with the classic bonus features complement the feature.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I can't make an informed comment about the quality of any of the Blue-Ray portions since I still only have a regular DVD player. As for the DVD disc included, it consists of the classic movie with restored picture and sound, a few trailers, a music video with Tiffany Thornton singing \\"Some Day My Prince Will Come\\" and a pretty nice sneak peek into The Princes and The Frog.

B0025KVLU6|1.0|The 2009 remaster is not worth buying unless:     * You don't own the same album already on CD.   * You are an audiophile who is willing to pay big bucks for small improvements.   * You like collecting stuff and want the cardboard and booklets that come with the new version.     Everyone who is saying there is a dramatic audible difference between this release and the previous CD is wrong. I'm not saying their opinion differs from mine, I'm saying they're wrong. That's a strong statement, and I'll try to back it up without getting too geeky.    The Beatles remasters are a little louder than the 1987 CD releases. Music sounds better as it's turned up a little louder (up to the point where it starts to annoy the listener). Most people don't have a way to exactly volume-level the two releases to compare them. That's why they think the new ones are so much improved, when they're only slightly improved.    <geek mode on>    Conventional wisdom is that most people cannot detect a loudness change of less than 3 decibels. That's not quite right--most people cannot detect a volume change of less than 3dB AS A VOLUME CHANGE. They can hear the difference but they think it's something other than a difference in loudness. They think they're hearing more detail, better bass, etc.--and they are, because you can hear everything better when it's louder, and you'll like it better (up to that annoyance point).    When you go to an audio store to buy speakers, the salesman typically has a vested interest (commission) in steering you toward a particular speaker. The unscrupulous ones will set things up so their pet speakers are 1 to 2 decibels louder than the others.  They don't push it too far, or people will detect that it's a loudness difference and ask to turn up the other speakers that the salesman wants to steer you away from.    The differences between the old and new recordings are not large, and the new recordings certainly haven't been ruined by being made a little hotter. Youcan easily measure the volume differences by ripping the albums to your computer with a program that can compute replaygain values. The differences on most of the Beatles tracks are....less than 3 dB. See where I'm going with this? The new recordings are louder, but not enough louder for many people to perceive the difference as a loudness difference.    For example, the 1987 version of Come Together from Abbey Road has a track replaygain value of -2.88. The remaster is -3.93, or 1.05 dB louder. (In the replaygain scale, things get louder as the negative numbers get bigger. Many horribly limited modern pop recordings have replaygain values of -8 or worse. Uncompressed audiophile classical recordings typically have replaygain values near zero or even a dB or two above zero.)    I ripped the new Beatles remaster to FLAC lossless format, storing replaygain values, and compared the new recording to my 1987 CD copy through a Logitech Squeezebox with Smart Gain enabled. This means I was able to listen to the new and old recordings at the same volume level. I also played them against each other with volume leveling off, and done this way it's easy to see why most people prefer the new release.    <geek mode off>     When volume-matched, the difference between the old CDs and the new remasters is audible AND minimal. And occasional. The most obvious difference is a slightly less restricted lower end.    We're owed better than this for all this money and hype. At the least, we should have gotten something as good as the Yellow Submarine remixes. Nobody who has heard Eleanor Rigby from that remix will ever confuse it with the original or prefer the original. Love and the Yellow Submarine remix and Let It Be Naked and the damn XBox game prove that the people who own the original tapes can do better and they know it.     They're milking us. Are you a cow?
B0025KVLU6|5.0|I seriously adore &#34;The White Album&#34;. The Beatles are a band that cycles in and out my music obsessed brain. From years in Jazz History, to Ustad Vilayat Khan performing &#34;Raag Saazgir&#34; in his glorius prime, To African Blues of Ali Farka Toure, Tom Waits, Brahms, Debussy, Beethoven and on and on for hours. Anytime I've been away from the Beatles for awhile, it I just think of &#34;The White Album&#34;, I admittedly wish I had a couple hours and some friends (if you know what I mean) to help me along the journey of just listening to this album front to back. With The Beatles, the original 80's cds were SO HORRIBLE that I basically had to give on The Beatles until some proper remasters were released (preferable Mono, but that seemed a literal impossible wish when no Beatles reissues had for the most part been released in decades) In 2009 both Mono and Stereo remasters were released and they were great! (I'm still excited just thinking about it!) With this in particular, neither version is the one to get, as both version contain important differences and work better for some songs than others. Some notes/thoughts on this album; - I love the flow of the album, starting with &#34;Back in the U.S.S.R.&#34; into &#34;Dear Prudence&#34; it puts it such a fantastic mood and spirit for an ecceltic Beatles Journey. Then &#34;Glass Onion&#34; references recent Beatles lore and songs, getting you even more hyped The Beatles in general and especially this point in their career. It's kind of a perfect sweet spot. Right after the immense creative high and spiritual change of the psychedelic era (which is in its way still stamped all over this album) and before the in fighting got so bad it began to surely mark that the end was near. It has a great combination of full band sounding performances and energy, as well as songs that sound like they would be off debut solo albums. The difference in the latter (than actual solo albums), is they are still being produced to some extent by George Martin, are still in the extremely high standards of late 60's art rock, Ringo's fantastic drumming (Paul too!) and seemingly just putting &#34;The Beatles&#34; moniker on top of them seems to make the songwriter push them towards sounding Beatleseque (harmony vocals for example). I have always been more of a George Harrison/John Lennon type of guy, but this album is my favorite of Paul's. His songs on here friggin blow my mind. &#34;Martha My Dear&#34; - god this song is awesome, &#34;Mother Nature's Son&#34; - god this song is awesome, &#34;Helter Skelter&#34; - god this song is awesome, &#34;Honey Pie&#34; - god this is aweomse, &#34;Blackbird&#34; - god this song is awesome.... you get the point. If there is one glaring issue with the album, it's that George Harrison is WAY underepersented for where his songwriting was at this point. It's especially a crime that &#34;Not Guilty&#34; and &#34;All Things Must Pass&#34; were not put on the album, among others. &#34;Not Guilty&#34; in particular is heavy with fantastic guitar work and energy. The 4 songs we get; &#34;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&#34;, &#34;Piggies&#34;, &#34;Long, Long, Long&#34; and &#34;Savoy Truffle&#34; are all fantastic and I love each one. Now onto John Lennon. &#34;Dear Prudence&#34; Is one of my favorites, and has awesome drum fills by Paul towards the end of the song. Other favorite are; &#34;I'm So Tired&#34;, &#34;Yer Blues&#34;, &#34;Glass Onion&#34; and &#34;Happiness is a Warm Gun&#34;. Many, many, many years ago (I'm 31) when I was still young and was hanging with Cid, &#34;Revolution 9&#34; would blow my mind. I'll admit that's its not always a welcome detour each time I listen to the album, but overall I'm grateful they had the balls to put it on the album as it enhances the journey and heightens &#34;Good Night&#34; so much. My least favorite John song would probably be &#34;The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill&#34;. Ringo Starr's drumming presence on the albumis perfect as usual. &#34;Good Night&#34; has beautiful vocals by Ringo, but &#34;&#34;Don't Pass Me By&#34; is easily the worst moment on the album and certainly one of the worst songs The Beatles recorded from &#34;Rubber Soul&#34; and on. Certainly songs like &#34;Junk&#34; or the aforementioned Harrison songs should have taken it's place in my opinion. That's my general thoughts on this masterpiece of an album. I like far, far better as a complete album than &#34;Abbey Road&#34; and I'm never sure why that albums reputation is so much better than &#34;The White Album&#34;. With the great news &#34;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&#34; Is getting a much needed stereo remix with many added outtakes, maybe we will get lucky and have the same thing happen with &#34;The White Album&#34;. &#34;Anthology 3&#34; already has a number of cool outtakes, with the best being &#34;Not Guilty&#34;, &#34;All Things Must Pass&#34;, &#34;A Beginning&#34; and &#34;Junk&#34;.

Cons: transparent twists (at least, to most mystery fans); shallow characterizations. My main gripe, though, is that Dan does not have the spiritual depth to carry off his ambitious themes. Although he makes some conciliatory gestures to other world religions and traditions, in the end he seems unable to rise above his hackneyed, fallen-away-Catholic opinions of \\"truth\\" and \\"revelation.\\" Skip the last 50 pages, unless you just feel the need to be preached at by someone with a very sophomoric grasp of comparative religion--and you want to close the book with a disappointed sigh and an eye-roll.

I ripped the new Beatles remaster to FLAC lossless format, storing replaygain values, and compared the new recording to my 1987 CD copy through a Logitech Squeezebox with Smart Gain enabled. This means I was able to listen to the new and old recordings at the same volume level. I also played them against each other with volume leveling off, and done this way it's easy to see why most people prefer the new release.    <geek mode off>     When volume-matched, the difference between the old CDs and the new remasters is audible AND minimal. And occasional. The most obvious difference is a slightly less restricted lower end.    We're owed better than this for all this money and hype. At the least, we should have gotten something as good as the Yellow Submarine remixes. Nobody who has heard Eleanor Rigby from that remix will ever confuse it with the original or prefer the original. Love and the Yellow Submarine remix and Let It Be Naked and the damn XBox game prove that the people who own the original tapes can do better and they know it.     They're milking us. Are you a cow?
B001GKYBXA|5.0|No one can dispute Paul McCartney's talent.  He's a master of melody, of pop sentiments and pithy phrases.  He's definitely the 'cute one.'  However, over the course of his solo career, something's often been missing.  That something is a strong collaborator.  McCartney's always been at his best with a strong songwriting partner (Lennon, of course, or Elvis Costello), a strong producer like George Martin, or highly individual musicians who both rein in his excesses and elevate his strengths (the Beatles, of course, and occasional solo releases).  In The Fireman, his collaboration with musician/producer/presumed co-writer Youth, he has all three.<br /><br />From the heavy opener \\"Nothing Too Much, Just Out of Sight,\\" which wouldn't sound out of place on a Zeppelin album, through the transcendent pop of \\"Sing The Changes\\" all the way through experiments like \\"Light from Your Lighthouse\\" and the closer \\"Don't Stop Running,\\" Electric Arguments veers all over the map from the gentle whimsy (\\"Two Magpies\\") to neo-psychedelic blues (the aforementioned opener, \\"Highway\\"), and yet is never mere imitation, but rather is always unmistakably a showcase for Paul McCartney.  His more adventurous side shines through this release with each and every moment, and it's the most exciting he's been in a very long time.<br /><br />It's nice to see McCartney truly spread his wings.  Highly reccomended.

0307278255|1.0|Time and again I am told that short stories don't sell well in America. And yet here we have Jhumpa Lahiri, who has churned out one more book of short stories, titled 'Unaccustomed Earth'. I say churned out because like its predecessor 'Interpreter of Maladies', this book too contains short stories about the miserable personal lives of  Bong (i.e. Bengali) Ivy Leaguers in America. Well that sums up the gist of the book. Reading it I felt like I was eating generic Chinese 'take out' food in a five star hotel. Let me explain.          Fiction has an ability of taking you inside the human mind, in a way, no other medium can. Ms. Lahiri's writing style is superb with beautiful attention to detail. Its almost like a five star hotel's presentation. Her narration melts in the mind like a creamy dessert on the tongue. But instead of using this talent to take us into brilliant and beautiful minds, she takes us into troubled and tormented minds. Like generic Chinese take out food with kikoman sauce, vinegar and soy sauce in every entree, each and every story in this book has the same flavor. They are all depressing, unhappy and the subjects are always Bong Ivy Leaguers. What a waste of talent!          There are three more factors that contribute to their generic taste. Although the stories are set in America, they clearly lack in energy, dynamism and speed; qualities that are characteristic of life in America. Secondly, most of them have no sense of time. Its hard to figure out if they are set in the Lyndon Johnson era or the Obama era. In short they are devoid of what is happening in America, outside the sleepy suburb. Third factor is their  shocking portrayal of Bong women  in America. They are either like 'Chokher Balis' or seem to belong to 'Sex and the City'.          Now for a technical assessment of their length. A short story is defined as having a  maximum word length of anywhere from 7000 to 9000 words. Ms. Lahiri has created her own standard by breaking all records. The stories run into sheafs of pages e.g. the first story is 57 pages long, which is over 16,000 words! Halfway  through the story, one starts wondering if its a novel! Now for the gist of the stories. The first story has the same title as the book and is about a father who visits his daughter Ruma, who is pregnant with her second child. After spending almost a week with her, he cannot tell her the fact that he has a girl friend after spending 40 years with Ruma's mother, who is dead now. The silent emotional turmoil is well presented.          'Hell-Heaven', the second story is about how a married woman (Chokher Bali kind)trapped in an arranged marriage to a man nine years older than her, falls in love with a Bong student, three years younger than her. She is emotionally devastated when the young lover marries an American girl only to dump her after twenty years of marriage with two daughters. After all this he marries another Chokher Bali! Seems like a day time soap opera!          'Only Goodness' is a sitcom about a S.I.T.C.O.M. (i.e. single income two children oppressive mortgage!). 'A Choice of Accomodations' (44 pages!) and 'Nobody's Business' (49 pages!) are two pointless stories that meander aimlessly through many pages, only to culminate in a wimpy climax. They both could have been easily edited to half their length without loosing the crux!          It is said that an education prepares you for a better tomorrow. If this is the kind of misery an Ivy League education creates, then it just goes to show how poor Ms.Lahiri's understanding is, of the real potential of such education.  After reading these five stories I became nauseous with their content and claustrophobic with their miseries. I couldn't read it any more. I closed it and looked up at the sky above, that offered more drama, beauty and dynamism as it changed appearance from afternoon to evening. As for the book, like stale Chinese food gone bad, I returned it to the library before time. James Allen in his book 'As A Man Thinketh' writes:          \\"A man's mind may be likened to a garden, which may be intelligently cultivated or allowed to run wild; but whether cultivated or neglected it must, and will, bring forth. If no useful seeds are put into it, then an abundance of useless weed-seeds will fall therein, and will continue to produce their kind.\\"          Keeping these words of wisdom in mind, publishers and literary agents have a responsibility of planting good books in the market that don't become weeds in the human mind. I suspect this book got published because Ms.Lahiri is a well-established writer and India is in vogue. The need of the hour is to find new Indian writers who are fresh with talent, creativity, diversity (not just Bong stories !!) and imagination. So if you are a publisher or a literary agent, then look no further, there is one such writer with her book, waiting to be discovered!(Check out my blog).

0061719544|5.0|I have always loved Craig from the first time I saw his show.  He is down-to-earth, funny, and his warmth shows through in his humor.  I was not disappointed by his life story, and do not agree with those who thought he went into too much detail.  I was drawn in by his story-telling, and was disappointed when it ended.  I think he did a wonderful job, and I hope that America and I will be blessed with many more years of his humor and love.

It's that good.<br /><br />I've read other books on getting organized. None of them can meet the standard set by this book. It's like a friend coming over and helping you organize your stuff. Most importantly, Sink Reflections clues you in on just how to get started, how to build momentum and how to keep yourself organized once you get moving!<br /><br />I'll never look at my kitchen sink the same way again!<br /><br />Update 2/8/16:  As you can see, I've had this book for some time now, and I still find it useful. My kitchen sink is still a key to a sense of organization and control! I've told lots of people about it, and they have all enjoyed and profited by it in one way or another. A definite must buy, that's for certain.

B00139W3NE|5.0|I liked this move a great deal..I have always liked these kind of movies...Science Fiction and Monsters etc..but this was really great, I thought. THe Gril playing the part, Dakota Blue Richards,.was very good and there were many great actor's in this movie..so that help's make it very enjoyable. About the Sound...Too often, these review's do not include anything about the format they play in. I for one am always interested in that aspect of the movies. This one comes in 6.1 dts ES...now that is what I call some really good sound-around. The first time I discovered dts was by accident..so now I look for movie's that have it. 5.1 is nice...5.1 dts is great..and now, 6.1 dts ES is even better. Discrete is the word here. So if you are looking for a great movie with much interest and some really great sound, this is the one...the ending kinda leaves you hanging...but I read here, that there should be another movie to continue. I am going to see if I can find it..becasue I want to see how it end's.<>Lon<>

B0026S1XDM|5.0|Not too overboard with sounds of electronic music muddling with the range of old and new guitar, piano and xylophone instruments, track one 2009 remix is the best I heard, especially the small bits of bonus tracks like my favourite is the Red Indian guitar melody from Let There Be Light. Mike is fearless, an emotion bigger than passion, and shows no limits and weaknesses in the new music evolution of Tubular Bells. The DVD with the moving triangular bell floating in the daylight-blue and evening-orange sky can hide the DVD player's boring menu page if I decide to play the CD in the player. I don't have the fancy surround sound stereo system and plasma or LCD TV except my old Sony CD walkman, old Panasonic 34 inch TV and DVD player. Living in a rental one-bedroom unit can be depressing, but the feelings of depression disappear every time I replay track one.
B00133KFGW|1.0|August Rush was the cinematic equivalent of drinking straight from a bottle of Karo corn syrup.<br />First of all, the kid's style of guitar playing is strongly reminiscent of the late Michael Hedges so if you like that sound - and it is a very cool sound - try listening to the real thing and buy a Michael Hedges CD or go watch some of his video on YouTube.<br /><br />Ok, now the ugly part... I'm a 54 year-old musician who believes music can found everywhere (one of this movie's themes).  I really related to the early part of the movie \\"August\\" is hearing melody and rhythm in various natural sounds (like the wind blowing through a field of grain)  When I was a teenager, long before the advent of sampling, I used to hear music in steam vents at an asphalt factory I worked at on the Pugent Sound.  I wanted to find a way to capture and execute that sound on strips of recording tape triggered by a keyboard (similar to a Mellotron in mechanics). I really do get the idea.  But then the movie disintegrates into a series of sappy situations and \\"awakening\\" events that are just too far fetched; this was perhaps the lamest, sappiest and most unbelievable drivel I have ever watched in my life.  Come on, did a junior high school drama enthusiast write this screenplay?<br /><br />A good movie, especially fiction, has to find a way to suspend belief.  August Rush fails miserably. Sure, a savant could start playing an instrument almost immediately.  But a savant (even Mozart) couldn't sit down and start writing musical notation without even 5 minutes of study to understand the lexicon used.  That's just preposterous.  And even if the kid could do that impossible feat, how would he know the ranges and tunings of the various instruments when writing those parts.<br /><br />It's too bad because with just a modicum of care and research this movie actually could have been made a little more believable.  The idea about music being every where really intrigued me and that's why I watched it.  August Rush was simply awful and an ordeal - a whirlpool of Karo corn syrup.  Yuck.  I'm all sticky now.mply awful and an ordeal - a whirlpool of Karo corn syrup.  Yuck.  I'm all sticky now.
0385504225|3.0|As always, the story is fascinating and the history is what keeps everything moving.  However, there are no surprises or \\"twists\\" in the plot.  I found it all rather predictable and the big scary \\"threat to national security\\" was kind of a joke. If asked about The Lost Symbol, I'd say it is OK.  I would wait for the soft cover, though.  On second thought, hold out for the mass market.
0312370849|5.0|Sarah's Key by Tatiana de Rosnay<br /><br />July 16, 1942. The French police rounded up Jewish families to be taken to Velodrome d'Hiver,an indoor stadium known as Vel' d'Hiv for short. Thousands of Jewish families were locked up there for days before being shipped off to Auschwitz. Sarah is a young girl who hid her brother in a locked cupboard in their apartment to be kept safe until her family was released by the police.She promises to come back for him. Sarah did not understand what was happening and that she wasn't to be going home. Once she does, she is desperate to get to her brother, to save him.<br /><br />July, 2002. Julia Jarmond is an American writer who has lived in Paris for the last 25 years. Her boss wants her to do an article on Vel' d'Hiv as the sixtieth anniversay approaches. This causes tension between Julia and her French husband Bertrand, as the French did not want to be reminded of that dark period in their history.<br />The first half of the novel alternates between Sarah's story and Julia's search for information. Julia discovers a link between her French family and Sarah. The second half of th book is Julia's search to discover what happened to Sarah, while dealing with the changes in her life and marriage.<br /><br />This is easily one of the best books I have read this year. Sarah's story is heartbreaking as she discovers the horror of what is happening to her and her parents.<br /><br />  The woman had little by little disappeared. She had become gaunt and pale, and she never smiled or laughed. She smelled rank, bitter. Her hair had become brittle and dry, streaked with gray. The girl felt like her mother was already dead.<br /><br /> Not only was this story well written but it brought to my attention the plight of the Jew's in France, something I did not know that much about. The book is heart-breakingly beautiful and touching, a story that will stay with me a long time. I read this in two days because it was so riveting. You won't be disappointed in this brilliant novel.<br /><br />my rating 5/5rating 5/5
B00004XQ83|5.0|I reviewed the movie itself and gave it three and a half stars, but the soundtrack gets all five!<br /><br />Some people have jokingly wondered if the Coen Brothers simply loved mountain music and found a way to fit a movie around it!<br /><br />Anyway the CD comes with a really nice booklet, including extensive liner notes placing the music into the historical context of both the Depression-era South as well as that of Homer's Odyssey.

B000002UZ1|5.0|First, a point of reference.  When this was originally released, this was the only compilation of late '60's Beatles songs available.  Perfect for the 8-track player and listening to in the car on long trips.  Plus, this had the version of \\"Let It Be\\" with a different guitar solo than the LP version.  All the songs here were played on the radio extensively (OK, maybe not \\"Old Brown Shoe\\") and that's why this was essential back in the day.  Now?  Maybe not, with all the CD's released since 1987.  Back in the day, it was hard to find some people who did not like the Beatles.  I find it interesting to read the negative comments of Beatles and Stones CD's to see if I have been wrong all these years.  I am glad that many young people (those born 1980 or later) have embraced the Beatles for the musical legacy they left us.  For those who just don't like them, well, that's their opinion and that keeps things interesting if you truly in fact do not like the music.<br />As for reviewing this CD, all the songs are great.  Not a bad one here.  Should be familiar to all Beatles fans.  This set (along with the Red Album) is a fine introduction for someone new to rock music.  Could some extra tracks have been added?  Of course.  But look at what happened with the releases of the 87 CDs.  I guess Capitol did not want to tinker with the original product.  So, for those from back in the day, or someone looking for a set of songs to keep in the car for listening, this does the trick.  Hopefully this will encourage new listeners to further explore the works of John, Paul, George and Ringo, and bring a smile to the faces of those of us who were there back in the day.
B001AQO3WY|5.0|As an OIF and 8 year Marine Corps veteran, I have always been disappointed with the portrayal of Marines on film. There's usually something wrong with the uniforms, the lingo, the attitude, or something and it tends to make the story unbelievable to real Marines. But they got everything right this time (well as close as they could). I was with 3rd AAV Battalion in '03 so I wasn't too far behind these guys. Watching this series gave me chills at points and I laughed at things no one else could understand. It sent me right back to Camp Matilda. I relived my whole war experience while watching this. I remember driving through those crossed swords too! The best part is the dialogue. I have been trying to explain how Marine communicate with each other and the is the best example I could give. Bottom line, if you want to get taste of true Marine Corps culture, watch this immediately!!! Its as accurate as I have ever seen. The attention to detail is outstanding and those characters are found all around the Corps.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Most superhero stories have relevance to politics and current events, and The Dark Knight can certainly be interpreted as a strong moral commentary on our troubled times. The telecommunications issue, terrorism, fighting evil and public perception is all directly addressed. The message appears to be that saving innocent life is the absolute priority for leadership. In pursuing that agenda, Batman resorted to a type of wiretapping and allowed his image to be forever tarnished. He even welcomed his fall from grace, recognizing early on that he could never fight evil effectively and remain popular to the public. Press and citizens in a free society will easily pick a part leaders making tough decisions and fighting tough fights--partially because those decisions and fights are not going to be popular--there is no perfect way to make those choices and execute those battles--and partially because there is no other visible lightning rod for public perception. In devising the story, Nolan hit upon a truth that the entire press corps seems to have forgotten: principle is more important than popularity. Having a squeaky clean image and saying all the right things are no substitute for the willingness or character to fight evil.     But regardless of whether you like the politics of The Dark Knight or prefer to just zone out and watch the mayhem, Warner's BD is a must-have for your collection. The film is truly unique and riveting, and Warner did a great job integrating the IMAX footage for 1080p.    Some of us think this is the best superhero movie of all time to date, great story, excellent direction of the film, good actors and one of the best performances of an evil character: The Joker interpreted by Heath Ledger, from my point of view this Joker is way better than the one play by Jack Nicholson.    The Joker of Jack is kind of childish, a great performance by Nicholson, but also kind of incredible; on the other hand the one played by Ledger is more credible, possible ifyou may say so, it stays also more true to the character invented for the comic realm, this guy is really sick!  Nothing childish about him, it is also kind of scary, and that's the point of it, the Joker is a mad man with no specific object in mind, he does as he please.    This is the content of the  BD:        Disc 1: Gotham Uncovered--a mish-mash of standard definition and high-def content, clocking in at one hour, this multi-part documentary replaces the need for an audio track and focuses on the unique elements that went into the creation of the sets, props and the use of IMAX cameras. It's a trove of information that no fan of The Dark Knight should miss.     Focus Points--a rather hidden picture-in-picture option available in specific episodes that turn out to be the above-mentioned documentaries. Those who find PIP to be distracting will prefer to watch the content as Gotham Uncovered.     Disc 2: Batman Tech--as part of three hours worth of documentaries, this featurette explores the many weapons and utilities designed for Batman. Most of them are based on military equipment.    Batman Unmasked--subtitled The Psychology of The Dark Knight, this documentary focuses on psychotherapeutic analysis of Bruce Wayne and Batman. Frankly, this content would have been more appropriate for Batman Begins, never the less it is appreciated here.     Gotham Tonight--a series of six newscasts averaging about eight minutes each. They all explore Batman and Bruce Wayne, as presented by \\"Gotham Cable's Premier News Program\\". The CNN-like news show played a role in several scenes of the main feature, but on its own, the newscasts for me seem a bit boring.     Galleries--watching the Joker cards rain down after the assassination of a judge in The Dark Knight, it is clear that many different types of cards are used. Here, they are all on display, along with TV spots and trailers, concept art, poster art and production stills.     While not perfect, this content features enoughinteresting documentaries and extracurricular activities to keep one occupied for hours on end. And a word about the packaging--under the slipcase, the text on the back of the packaging artwork has been \\"marked up\\" with edits by the Joker. The brief description of the movie has been defaced and there is graffiti pointing to a photo of the Joker, \\"ME\\" and many \\"HA HA\\" and \\"BLAH BLAH\\" comments. This was a good finishing touch to a classic BD package: a combination of creepy and cute.

B002BEXG86|3.0|I just received this in the mail today, I could not wait to hear it. I have the regular CD release, and an import release which is better than the the regular copy. I was not very happy with this, the highs are still dull. This is no better than my import copy, What A waste of my money. I guess we will never see a real remastered copy, so buyer beware. Of course this is just my opinion, it still sounds flat to me.Try the new real remaster from Japan, it is way better than this one.
0385504225|3.0|I have read his other books and this one is similar in plot and structure.  I feel it is about 100 pages too long as it seems to bog down towards the end.  Like his other books, it mixes fact with fiction and goes off on a quasi-religious philosophical jaunt that gets repetitious and a bit boring.  Not a bad read, but it can put you to sleep several times.

B00003CXA6|5.0|I don't often give movies a 5-star rating. [[ASIN:B00003CXA6 Gettysburg]] is one of those rare exceptions. This is a movie about the Battle of Gettysburg, one of the most pivotal moments in U.S. history. The movie rises to the occasion. The acting is great, with Martin Sheen as General Robert E. Lee and Jeff Daniels as Colonel Chamberlain. The film has a beautiful cinematography and an incredible soundtrack by Randy Edelman. This is a masterpiece and will remain a classic for decades to come. I wish it had encouraged more historical fiction movies, but in the years since 1993 I haven't seen many movies of this caliber.
0385504225|5.0|The Lost Symbol by Dan Brown<br /><br />I was the first to get my library copy of Mr. Brown's long-anticipated sequel to The Da Vinci Code.  The only similarities to that blockbuster novel is that it's another thriller for Robert Langdon.  This novel takes place in Washington, DC where all our nation's important buildings have Masonic symbols on them.  And, yes, this absolute thriller and page-turner is all about the Masons and their secret society.  Since my gg grandfather, my g grandfather and my grandfather were 32nd level, I've known a bit about this organization and my grandmother was in Eastern Star, the women's group.  From reading this novel, I learned there was one higher level in the Masons and that the very elite have that honor of being a  33rd level.<br /><br />This story starts out with Robert being summoned to the US Capitol for a special speaking engagement, but when he arrives, he enters into a completely empty room!!!  Within minutes, Robert and a few others, including a high ranking CIA officer, are shocked to find the severed hand of Robert's best friend and mentor, Peter Solomon, who they find has been kidnapped.<br /><br />There are flashbacks to earlier days in Peter's life where he has seen tragedy, along with his younger sister, Katherine, who is an esteemed Scientist working on cutting edge technology.  Her offices and lab are in a secluded area of the Smithsonian Museums Special Center that houses miles upon miles of historical artifacts not seen by the public.  Our villain is so cunning and brilliant, he finds a way to get into her lab while she's there doing research.  When you think the coast is clear, this villain is two steps ahead.  I was surprised by how cleverly Mr. Brown set that up, so that our villain Mal'akh, was able to keep that two steps ahead.  Our villain so dabbled in the dark arts, it's no wonder he was so evil.<br /><br />The thing I liked about this book were the interesting facts about our special buildings in Washington, like the Capitol Building, the Smithsonian Museum, The National Cathedral, Library of Congress, where looks are deceiving.  Then the Washington Monument and the House of the Temple, the main Masonic Temple for the elite 33rd Masons.  In this spellbinding novel, there are symbols within symbols and the race is on for Robert to solve this puzzle before it's too late.  Is it also too late for Robert to save both Peter's and Katherine's lives and even his own or his Country?  You better run to get this book to find out!!!!  Another reason I thoroughly enjoyed this novel is the short, cliff-hanging chapters, which I so love with Mary Higgins Clark's books.  And, for those who don't like Dan Brown's books because of all the fabrications in them, you've got to realize these are total fiction and he is a master story-teller!!! And, this is much better than The Da Vinci Code, at least, in my humble opinion.<br /><br />Forever Friends Rating A HUGE 5 Stars by Teri<br />Until Next Time, See You Around The Book Nook.<br /><br />Pub.

0316166685|4.0|The story is told by the victim.  I found it hard to get into at first, but it became more interesting as I continued to read.  It's easy reading and isn't a really thick book.  I found it enjoyable reading.

B0001KZM3O|5.0|We were in a conservative era. Reagan and Thatcher fighting the Cold War and the UK coming off the heels of The Falklands conflict. Hippies and punk-rockers had pretty much put down their protest signs and angst and were migrating to the suburbs. Seemingly out of nowhere comes this powerful political statement from Pink Floyd. I am grateful Gilmour and Waters were able to maintain until they finished this project.     On The Final Cut, Pink Floyd leads us through the hellish depression and trials of a war veteran while dabbling in commentary on nationalism, consumerism, and economics. This album features outstanding lyrics by Roger Waters (yes he is bitter still, so what). And where previous albums had plenty of rocking out tracks, The Final Cut relies much more on the subtleties, i.e. Waters' vocal delivery (think Comfortably Numb's \\"pin pricK\\") or the holophonic sound effects. Add this to a subtle orchestration, and some fantastic Gilmour guitar work and you have a powerful, sad, and haunting album.     Every track gets a four or five star rating. The strongest being \\"One of the Few\\", \\"The Gunner's Dream\\", and \\"Paranoid Eyes\\". If you have a comprehensive appreciation of Pink Floyd, you won't be disappointed.    -footnote- Regarding the Waters' Solo versus Pink Floyd debate, the amount contributed by each of the band members is irrelevant as one only need listen to the album to see it could never have been legitimately labeled a solo work.

0307454541|5.0|I enjoyed this book immensely. The characters are great, the story (and the stories within the story) is gripping, and the book offers a great sense of satisfaction at the end. I just finished the sequel 'The Girl Who Played with Fire' and found it every bit as enjoyable. Can't wait to read the final book of the trilogy!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|this book is the best of the four. i procrastenated to finish the book, but never wanted to put the book down. i highly recomend this book
0439023491|5.0|Not a book on it's own.  Need to have read [[ASIN:0439023483 The Hunger Games]] for the background.  A new perpsective of life in the future.  Exciting w/ it's ups and downs, twist and turns, dealing w/ life (such that it is) and death. Can not wait for book 3 to see how it all climaxes and who ends up with whom.
0316017922|4.0|Although Malcolm Gladwell's thesis in Outliers- that success is primarily a product of one's upbringing, environment, and culture- is not particularly new or innovative, the case studies that he uses to illustrate this point are very interesting and insightful.  Critics have said that he cherry-picks these cases to illustrate his point.  He does, to an extent, but this does not take away from the book's quality.  The cases that he does use reinforce his main thesis in entertaining, sometimes disturbing ways (read the chapter on the cause of many airline crashes for the disturbing aspect).    Buy this book for the interesting case studies that he does use.  Do not buy it if you are seeking a book that unearths new, groundbreaking research on the roots of success.  The fact that it is a quick read and easy to follow is icing on the cake.
0385504225|5.0|Fisrt off let me say that all of these reviews complaining of the content of the book as boring and long and not worth reading, I whole-heartedly disagree. This book was as riveting and esoteric as the DaVinci code if not more so. I couldn't put it down. I received it on Friday afternoon and finished it on Sunday afternoon. Mr. Brown's knowledge of his subject matter is very accurate and very concise. Although there is some information that is not entirely correct the book is great entertainment and well researched. Having visited Washington D.C. I could see in my minds eye all the places described in the book. His desriptions are very accurate and the characters are beliveable. As usual there is an unexpexted twist at the end. This book is definitely worth your time and money. Great job Mr. Brown!

0385504225|5.0|Though I seldom read fiction, I thorougly enjoyed Dan Brown's \\"The Lost Symbol.\\" As a teacher in the consciousness movement for nearly 30 years, I am thrilled that through this book Dan Brown is introducing the very important and timely topic of the co-creative power of thought and intention to such a very, very wide audience. Having personally spent time in dialogue with Lynn McTaggart and other scientists sharing similar views on the power of consciousness such as Deepak Chopra, Gregg Braden, Bruce Lipton and Elizabet Sahtouris, I appreciate how Dan has handled the explanation of this science in such a creative, yet accurate, way.

B0029358GM|3.0|Dear Mr. Tweedy:<br /><br />I really wish I liked Wilco (The Album) as much as I like Wilco (The Band).<br /><br />Wilco (The Song) starts off promising, with a charging wall of bluesy guitar sound. But the lyrics, a tongue-in-cheek love letter from your band to its fans, feel flat and uninspired, a lazy victory lap rather than an exploration of new territory.<br /><br />I'm sorry, Mr. Tweedy, if I'm hating on you for loving on me. There are some great moments here, to be sure; the next two songs rank among your band's best work.  But all in all, the album has a slightly generic feel. There's a taste of almost everything your band's done--the pastoral melodies of \\"Sky Blue Sky\\" and the pleasant pop of \\"Summerteeth\\" and the guitar workouts of \\"A Ghost is Born\\" and the countrified psychedelia of \\"Being There\\" and the experimentalism of \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.\\" But so many tastes end up making for a relatively bland album, at least by your band's standards. It's almost as if you put your discography in a blender and hit \\"Puree.\\"<br /><br />A little bit of everything ends up being a whole lot of nothing. Well, maybe that's a little harsh, but I do mean it, or something like it. You sound content and philosophical and meditative--on \\"Solitaire,\\" you mention how it \\"took too long for me to see I was wrong to believe in me only,\\" and that sounds like a statement from a healthy and happy and well-adjusted individual. But is that what we want? I kinda miss the alienation of \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" and elsewhere, the angsty Jeff Tweedy that sang \\"I am so out of tune with you\\" on \\"Being There's\\" \\"Sunken Treasure.\\" Granted, you can't keep doing the same thing over and over again, and I don't necessarily want that. But I do want something more solid and substantive than this, whatever the mood. In some ways, your previous album, though it had fewer rough edges, was a bolder statement, in that it was at least a solid and consistent and thematically whole piece of work.  That one, and every other album since \\"A.M.\\" felt like an artistic statement, a \\"This is what Wilco is\\" kind of gesture that somehow also expanded the definition of what Wilco was. This one feels like a question in response to a question, as if someone asked \\"What is Wilco?\\" and you replied, \\"Well, what do you want us to be, baby?\\"<br /><br />I'm sorry if I was harsh. This isn't goodbye; it's still a see-you-later. Look around for me the next hometown gig; I'll be the one wearing a party hat.<br /><br />Love,<br />Alfonso.\\" felt like an artistic statement, a \\"This is what Wilco is\\" kind of gesture that somehow also expanded the definition of what Wilco was.

1934648035|2.0|This was a reading assignment in 11th grade for me back in the day (2004) and I have to say the story wasn't horrible, but there was nothing there to really pull you in. At that point in my life, I had been meditating for a couple of years on an almost daily basis,(sometimes 2-3 times a day) read lots of spiritual books, and studied and read sacred religious texts,(Bible, Quaran, Bhagavad Ghita) so nothing really mystified me in this book. I wasn't/am not one of those snobbish judgmental spiritual people or a religious person. I was one of those guys who was well spoken, funny, relaxed, smart, and wasn't afraid to talk to anyone. I didn't/don't know everything or pretend to, but I didn't/don't have a lot of fear.<br /><br />  Anyway, I did like the one time in the book where Siddhartha saw Krishna, that was pretty cool, but that's it. Basically, Siddhartha over-analyzes EVERYTHING. EXAMPLE: Siddhartha sees a dead body. Siddhartha thinks something like,\\" Life is so bleak, mundane, and pointless yet we all try to reach happiness and utterly fail.\\" AGAIN...Something like that! Something self-loathing, dark, gloomy, and BORING. You get that instead of Siddhartha seeing it for what it really is. (in a true spiritual light) EXAMPLE: \\"There's a dead body. It has learned it's lessons in life and has left this side of life and is now resting with God on the Other Side.\\" Siddhartha moves on. ( I know my 2nd example wouldn't make a good story, but this happens for just about the whole book and it gets very annoying.)<br /><br />  Also, this book is LOADED with messages that say something like,\\"Only you can make yourself happy by being yourself and by not trying to please others.\\" My response: \\"Wow!!! Really???!? Thanks for clearing that one up for me!\\"  The book also really tries to make goods from the outside world seem like your enemy. UM...NO. It's okay to have nice things, just don't go buying dumb things like a golden toilet, get too obsessed with them, (The old saying goes: \\"YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU\\") or see yourself as better than anyone because of what you can afford and they can't. If you have a hobby that requires spending money for equipment or whatever, go ahead and spend your money and don't feel guilty. Just don't fall into the trap of compulsive shopping and buying tons of crap you don't need to make yourself feel good.<br /><br />  Overall, I didn't like this book. The \\"Spiritual\\" lessons learned in this book aren't anything new or ground breaking to anyone who is truly involved with having a balanced way of life. This book reminds me of those people who get worked up and completely over analyze things by saying,\\"What if today was your last day? Would you be okay with that?\\" I have compassion and don't say anything, but the real answer to that question is: If you are soooo concerned about it, then shut up and start doing it. Those who can live life to the fullest are already doing it. Those who can't ( or wont,) complain and worry about it.saying goes: \\"YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU\\") or see yourself as better than anyone because of what you can afford and they can't.

B000RZIGVS|1.0|First of all, let me state the obvious - TNG was a great show. And I am very happy to be able to watch it now at my leisure. However, in reviewing this product, it must be said that it is really disappointing that Paramount did such a crappy job. Yes, the lime green disc cases are thin and easily breakable, there are no summaries of the episodes, and the quality of the video is pretty low  - some scenes are clear, and then all of a sudden, it looks soft and almost hazy. Kind of shocking really for a sci-fi release. Audio commentary would really be nice, too.<br /><br />Obviously corners were cut to increase profit margins. I'm disgusted, they ought to know their fan base would be critical of a bad release, or extremely grateful for a good one.<br /><br />Being such a big fan, I bought it anyway, used.  I don't want to give any more $ to the studio. I highly suggest you do the same - money talks, my friends.
B00005O438|5.0|Cujo (1983) was definately a triumph.  The story of a rabies-infected dog is gripping.  It was sad that Cujo became vicious as he was such a loveable dog transformed by something out of his control.  Te characters are very human.  Dee Wallace plays Donna, the woman trapped in her car by Cujo.  She gives an amazing performance as a woman fighting to survuve and get her son Tad (Danny Pintauro) to safety.  Pintauro is believable as a boy who is frightened out of his mind and soon is stricken by heat exhaustion and hunger/thirst.  Daniel Hugh Kelly is great as Vic, Donna's husband, who is called away when his ad line for a cereal brand is taken off the shelves after a health scare.  The subplot of Donna having an affair makes the characters seem even more like real people.  The last half hour is white-knuckle intense.  The director adds some unique camera angles and builds the characters and suspense.  Plus the ending is more upbeat than the novel, which works better for the movie.  Cujo is a great film.

0316776963|3.0|I was enjoying the book in the beginning, when David was dealing with his lisp and all. Sedaris is a very witty writer and I appreciate that. However, by the middle of the book I was losing interest. The character became less witty and more irritating as he progressed through adulthood in Paris. He led a life so sad, even Sedaris failed at putting an interesting spin on it.
0060574216|1.0|I was excited to read this book, hoping for some insight. by page 89 (still reading) I was shaking my head, laughing at the absurdity.   It is like he is portraying women as 6yr old whiney, emotionally unstable people. Men as temperamental 5 yr olds that you need to give space to and let them do what they want.  Makes women sound needy or have neediness as he tries to distinguish.  Let men brood and go into their \\"cave\\" and not accept our \\"help\\" because either we're not capable of giving them help or sounds like we are \\"hounding\\" or \\"judging\\" them and then says to make us (females)  more \\"emotionally stable\\" to give us lines that to me sounded sickly sweet and not real...just to sort of pacify of our emotions.  Really look at how he is approaching the \\"communication\\". it made me want to throw up. I am 40 something female and pretty stable and found this insulting.  What era was he writing this for? It doesnt apply to things I've been in.   I am sure this will help some, and give relevant insights here and there. But do not feel this book is \\"real life\\" regardless of the 25,000 he said he interviewed.  The communication, to me, will not work with these guidelines of what to say, not say. sorry everyone! I want it good for all of us too and I agree with being compasssionate, understanding and gentle, but not the way he explains it.  Thanks for reading this.
B002GZQY6Q|3.0|Wilson might do his Muse a favour and take some time off. Neither Fear of a Blank Planet nor this disc quite measure up to In Absentia, Live from Warsaw, Deadwing or Arriving Somewhere Live. There is nothing especially wrong with this disc, it simple never grabbed me as the aforementioned. The band is certainly spot on among the twists and turns of Wilson's compositions, but I found little of it as compelling as other discs, and following on the heels of Blank, a slew of solo projects, maybe Steve should give it a rest. He's going blind, and a bit monotonous. The lyrics are also in need of fresh inspiration. The arrested emotional development schtick is getting tedious. Most women I play PT to think he is a bit of an adolescent. Take some time off, Steve, you've earned it and your music deserves it. Robert Fripp will keep the band on their toes while you get it back together.  And going forward, no one is waiting for an 18 minute, never mind 55 minute suite. Mike Oldfield got away with it. Once.
1439157383|5.0|Magical. That's how i describe this book because even if it made me cry my eyes out it has a special place in my heart. It really teach you about thing in life that you take for granted.
0439023483|5.0|You know, every single time I'd choose the next book to read; I would always skip reading this book. It sat on my shelf for what seemed like forever, I think possibly 3 months? Anyway, so Catching Fire is coming out this coming Monday so I decided to read it and see if this series was any good. Everyone said the book was really good, but boy they did not do the book justice! It's insane, just the idea of sending 12-18 years off to kill each other off for entertaining purposes was very repulsive to me, but the author wrote it in such a way that was just interesting and captivating. The book is told from Katniss' point of view, she's a very strong character and will do anything to provide for her family and means for survival. I couldn't quite believe that she took her sister's place in the Hunger Games, another 12 year old had been chosen and no one volunteered for her, so it just shows how much she truly did care about her family. Peeta, oh Peeta. He was so sweet; I liked him from the beginning. It's kind of weird though because the entire time that I was reading this novel, I was thinking... Maybe one day we will end up like that, ruthless and insane. Especially with the scientifically and technical advancements that will make what we have today look petty. This author wrote this book just right, not too much gore but just enough to make someone want to change something. Anyway, I give this book 4.5 out of 5 paws.

0802798225|5.0|Okie so I happened to be at B&N pre-ordering Blood Promise when I decided to get this book. I didn't have to pay for BP right there and then so I had some extra cash and decided to get it. I initially saw this on Eleni's blog, La Femme Readers and saw how much she enjoyed it so I decided to get it. I didn't get around to the book in like forever, but I can not believe how amazing it turned out! The story line is captivating and it was just told perfect! This novel is told from both Brittney and Alex's point of view, which I apparently didn't know or if I did, I just forgot. I abs loved all of the Spanish culture in this novel! I'm Hispanic myself so everything they mentioned was something that I grew up with or my parent's did. Alex's chapter's appealed to me most, just because they reminded me of my home life, especially his mother. Brittney's appealed to me because I guess I was the same way she was in High School. I was the first in the family to graduate high school and go to college so in school I was forced to be \\"perfect\\" until I broke free after my senior year. There were moments in this novel that made me both laugh and cry. It's honestly an amazing book. Major props go out to Simone Elkeles for creating such an amazing story! Overall I give this novel 5 out of 5 paws!
B000MQC9H4|5.0|Cameron Diaz and Jude Law have total chemistry, unfortunately Jack Black and Kate Winslet don't. Cameron and Jude's characters save the day though and carry the whole movie. Kate's friendship with her neighbor does your heart good. In spite of the lack of chemistry between one of the two couples in the movie, I've probably watched it at least 50 times. Makes me feel like love is still possible. And who wouldn't want to watch Jude Law?
0439023491|5.0|I devoured this novel! I cannot express how much I really loved this novel! Okie so this book picks up from the end of the Hunger Games, in which Peeta and Katniss are going on their victory tour.  The victory tour in which all hell breaks loose. It's crazy! I'll start with the cover, which is abs beautiful! The jacket is so smooth and red! I loved it! The Mockingjay is of course on the front cover and if you take off the jacket, the same bird is featured in black against a red background which stands out really nicely. The novel had a different feel to it than the previous book. I guess you can say it was a little darker in a sense. Well if you think about, these two kids watched a lot of other kids die in very horrific and traumatizing ways. It does leave a mark so that's where I sense the darkness coming from. Katniss continues to amaze me in her strength, despite going through all of what she had in the Hunger Games, and she still protected those she loved. The relationships between Gale and Katniss, as well as, Peeta and Katniss are so intense and confusing. I think I'm leaning toward Team Peeta but then again I haven't read enough about Gale to form my complete opinion. I think Suzanne Collins intended it to be that way because in a sense you were feeling exactly the way that Katniss feels. She's torn between two people she loves, now how she loves them, she's not totally sure and it's interesting to see how their relationships progress. I couldn't believe some of the stuff that happened in this book! I was so surprised it is not even funny! The end makes me want the last book in the series now! Def deserves 5 out of 5 paws!<br /><br />review can be found at [...]
B001V7YWTQ|4.0|As close to a Blind Faith reunion that your ever gonna get.Nice mix of solo and Blind Faith material.The playing of songs from the different bands they've  been members of was cool.
0061767581|3.0|You can clearly tell this book is by a first time author. It took me forever to finish this novel. To be perfectly honest I was very spectacle about this book, the only real reason I got it was because there was a local book signing and I really wanted to meet her and I mean the plot of the book sounded good, so I got it. Well the novel is told in third person omniscient, although most of the novel is told from Jane's point of view. You get a glimpse into Madison's, Trevor's and Scarlett's mind and way of thinking. There are four girls in L.A. Candy, the new hip series. There's Madison, the gymnast girl who pretty much loves attention; Gaby, the clueless girl; Scarlett, the smart one and Jane, the hot and sweet chick. The characters and events seemed a little clich&eacute; in a way, but I do have to give her props for keeping me on edge about Jane's love life. I think that's where it really got interesting in the novel. I can kind of relate to Jane and Scarlett's relationship because they are really close at first and then certain events and things happen that make them slowly drift apart. Lauren Conrad did a good job of describing places and accessories. The one thing that I didn't was that it pretty much read like a twitter post sort of. Like, she did this and then she did that. I'm still curious to see what there's in store for the next novel in the series because it had a huge cliffhanger so we'll see. I give this book 3 out of 5 paws.
014241493X|5.0|I first read Paper Towns a few months ago, but I ordered the paperback (not owning the hardcover) a few weeks before it was released and recieved it yesterday. The paperback being the first thing I'd ever bought off Amazon, I hadn't had the opportunity to write a review about it before, and since I'm rereading it now...well, here I am.    Paper Towns is a novel that you want to use the word \\"nuanced\\" to describe, over and over again. It's a deliciously funny novel, but more than that, it asks several important questions--for instance: \\"Do we really ever know a person?\\" It then proceeds not to answer them for us, but to supply clues that let us draw our own conclusions. Green clearly has no problem with style issues--Paper Towns is hilariously real--or humor--Paper Towns was the funniest book I've read in a long time.    I've read all three of John Green's books, and while there is some tiny lack of originality in them, this doesn't matter to me nearly as much as the fact as the author manages to create a novel that is uproariously funny, yet still deals with important issues in a far-reaching way. Overall, Paper Towns is 'nuanced', and a definite 5. Nerdfighters rule!
B002L5GQGY|5.0|It's been three years since Joe Bonamassa's last DVD, and almost everything thing about the band is brand new since his last DVD. The three piece has evolved into a four piece, and for this special event, there is another set of drums and a horn section. Joe's brand new producer, Kevin Shirley, the man behind Joe's last 3 CD's, brings his insight and creativity into the mix as well. With the new setup, Joe has soared to new and uncharted territory. That isn't more evident than in this DVD.    The performance starts off with a short interview with Joe and then goes right into the concert.  The playlist is mostly off The Ballad of John Henry and tunes Joe plays on tour. A couple songs into the set, Joe brings out Eric Clapton in a once-in-a-lifetime rendition of Further Down the Road.  The concert runs for another 2 hours in high-quality 5.1 DTS and has an equal mix of Joe's powerful blues tunes and his guitar-shredding ones, and each one will one is turbo-charged with passion and precision. The editing is solid and the audio has no noticeable problems. Unfortunately, there's no Blu-Ray version of the concert, but you won't miss it.     This is must-have for any Bonamassa fan and frankly, any person who like any bit of guitar or soul in their music. It's a soul-shaking performance that will make you wonder why this guy isn't on all the radio stations.
031604461X|5.0|I love this copy of Breaking Dawn. I love how it's Doubled Covered and on the back it has a poster from the Twilight Graphic Novel.. I love how it comes with the Breaking Dawn Concert Series.. I love how there are interviews at the end with Stephenie Meyer and I love how there are Lyrics to the Blue October songs that were an Inspiration throughout the Saga..
B0009U5DD0|4.0|Many (and I really do mean MANY) years ago I saw a Pierce Brosnan movie that closed with the song \\"My Way\\" done in a Latin American style with some SERIOUSLY impressive guitar work and vocals that (although I don't know the language) would have, and should have, knocked Frank Sinatra right on his can! AND WAIT; there's more! My reaction to and desire for this song led me on a chase that lasted a number of years until I found out the band was the Gipsy Kings and finally got my first CD: \\"Love & Liberte'\\" which I have quite literally played into the ground. These guys are AMAZING! Their guitar work (largely acoustic) easily rivals Little Feat (with Lowell George) and would also impress the Eagles (think of the rerelease of \\"Hotel California\\" where at one point it sounds like at least 6 total  6 and 12 string guitars are at the crossroads playing for their lives. YES, the Gipsy Kings are that good. Don't make the mistake of getting hung-up on the language difference (if there is one).  GET HOOKED ON THE MUSIC!  I defy anyone to listen to this CD and not find more that just a few things to love about it..... I find new ones every time I listen to anything they've done.
B002BVXYRM|4.0|Well, I am going to try and keep this short. If you are investigating purchasing this edition of the album you already know about this release so I wont bore with the details. Disc 2 is quite excellent, especially the BBC recordings. A high point would be \\"How to disappear\\" which has a full minute of a creepy drone intro. The live recordings from France are a nice addition as well. What is disappointing about this is the dvd. Only 3 live songs from Later with Jools? What gives? This is especially strange since the dvd in the Amnesiac special collectors edition is LOADED with goodies. If you are debating purchasing this or the two disc version look at it this way. Disc 2 is where it's at. I could take or leave the dvd. The reason I purchased the 3 disc version is that KID A is IMO one of the greatest albums of this decade so I was going to purchase the 3 disc regardless. I would however HIGHLY suggest you pick up the 3 disc Amnesiac. If you are a mild to moderate Radiohead fan just pick up the 2 disc version and save the 10 additional bucks that you would cough up to buy this. I hope this was somewhat helpful.
0123694965|5.0|I will keep it simple.  Within the first 2 or 3 paragraphs i knew this book was going to be different from all the other game design books I read.  And all in a good way.  The author nails the definition and true drive of a game designer.  This book (as like most other game design books) is applicable to all type of games.  Computer Console, RPGs, Miniatures, Card, all of them.    If there is one book you want to read for game design, MAKE IT THIS ONE.  It has a companion helper book \\"The art of game design:  A deck of lenses\\" that is a collection of helper questions to ask yourself while designing a game to make sure it is the best that it can be.  I have not read it, but if it is even just half as good as this book, it would be worth it to get that one too.
B002BVXYRC|5.0|No one has put their two cents on this yet? This is what a collectors edition is all about. First start off with the packaging. The box is bound with a canvas that has a textbook feel and look to it (does that make sense)? You all know about disc 1 (standard disc). Disc 2 is nice because it collects all of the b-sides from the Amnesiac singles plus adds some live cuts from Canal studios. What makes this release a must have is the dvd. It has videos, two live cuts from \\"Top of the Pops\\" and additional songs from Later with Jools. The dvd with this is superior to the one found in the KID A special collectors edition (however I prefer KID A to Amnesiac straight up). So kids cough up the extra cabbage for the 3 disc Amnesiac. (In regards to how you feel about this being a cash grab by capitol records...well it is what it is I suppose, but you have to admit they have done a really good job so far with these releases).
0385504225|1.0|Possibly one of the worst books I have read in years.  The first books were entertaining.  This one falls short on every measure.
0307454541|5.0|Read this book and the next one on my Hawaii vacation. Good read and worth buying.
0439023483|5.0|I could not put this book down, and when I had to, I was dying to get back to it. It was absolutely and utterly amazing. It had me laughing, crying, screaming, and emitting all sorts of emotions because I became so engrossed in the story. It made me feel like I was actually there and that these characters were my friends. You will not be disappointed with this book.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|I can remember watching Star Trek when it was on primetime in the 60's. I immediately fell in love with the show seen every motion picture they have put out   \\"wrath of kahn\\" is my fav. and also liked the TNG. The rest of the spinoffs not to good. I took my son to the newest Star Trek movie the first day it came out. And of course I loved it. I think they did a great job with Kirk just like I imagined him to be when he was young. It was kinda strange with Uhura and Spock dating, loving or whatever was going on with them :-) Kinda got mad when the old Spock came in with his time travel thing but by the time the movie was over I figured it all out. Maybe they should call the planet Vulcan 2 now. Also it would seem like a long time before they could re-seed a new planet. Anyway I will be watching each new movie when its released until the day I die.
B002ELM5HY|5.0|I am one of the few to experience this brilliant music prior to most. His music really gives me the chills. It seems a bit like every song has a bit of an Irish tune in it and probably that makes it brilliant. It recently appeared to me that every great musician moves to a mellow tune as they grow old. it's like from standing and moving with the tune to sitting on a couch and sipping on brandy kind....
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|GREAT, I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO SAY, WELL YES I DO IT'S SO TRUE. IN SO MANY WAYS, THE [...]GRANDAUGHTER ASKING FOR THE CAR EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS DISRESPECTFUL TO THE EXTREME. THE NEIGHBORHOOD BEING IN A CONSTANT STATE OF DISREPAIR WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE HOUSE. I WEEP FOR THIS COUNTRY. THIS MOVIE SPELLS OUT SO MANY THINGS THAT WE WON'T OR DON'T WANT TO RECONIZE. SOME OF YOU WILL RIP ON MY CONSTANT SPELLING ERRORS AS A WAY TO DISTRACT YOU FROM THE TRUTH BUT WE ALL KNOW WHAT I AM SAYING. THE MAIN CHARACTER WHILE FLAWED SHOWED ME, IF NOT ALL WHO SAW THIS MOVIE HOW FLAWED AND SHALLOW OUR LIVES HAVE BECOME, THANK YOU CLINT EASTWOOD AND BRAVO.
B001R0KH3M|4.0|Great show!  the set was creative, the backup musicians were all first rate. Some of the audience participation songs could have been deleted
B002KH4KSY|3.0|I agree with the other reviewer when he said that this movie leaves you wanting more (maybe for the wrong reasons), but it follows the Stephen King's original short story not the 1984 film, so you shouldn't go in expecting it to recreate every detail of the original. My only real issue with this reboot/\\"re-imagining\\" is that Preston Bailey who plays Isaac is terrible. It seemed as if he was handed his lines immediately before scenes were shot and was scrambling to get all of the words out before he forgot what he was supposed to say. Also, his delivery was just awful... he always used the same tone and never seemed to put emphasis on any of his words. John Franklin's performance as Isaac in the original was powerful and commanding, it was easy to see why even the older children would follow/fear him... here it's laughable when Malachi (Daniel Newman) takes orders from Isaac. Negatives aside, all of the other cast members played their parts well (Daniel Newman gave the best performance imo) and the blood/gore seemed to be of a higher quality than what's typical of a SciFi (SyFy) Original. Children of the Corn was actually a decent flick, worth watching at least once... don't go in expecting much, but don't let the \\"SyFy Original\\" tag completely scare you off either.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|The image quality is absolutely SUPERB. This dark, gritty, reference sci-fi thriller will absolutely stun u.   The audio dynamics are also impressive. I feel most people may think five discs may be a little much. Blade Runner fanatics will enjoy every minute.
B002GZQYMK|4.0|Muse isn't exactly breaking a lot of new ground here.  This album is a little more operatic, a little more theatrical, a little more like Queen, but there's no real change to the sound they've had for years.  It's actually one of the most predictable albums I've heard in years.  I could guess some of the flourishes and melodies before they finished happening, and the only real surprise was when \\"Exogenesis\\", the three part symphony that closes the album and impresses the most of anything on the record, didn't explode bombastically at some point, instead merely building and then falling pretty beautifully.    It's not a bad album by any means, just an unexciting one for a group that's ostensibly unique and totally original.  I can't think of any groups that have the mix of synth elements, driving bass, and falsetto vocals that make up their identity, but it doesn't quite sound new anymore.  Also, Matthew Bellamy's guitar playing is totally restrained here, which is not a good thing at all.  \\"Uprising\\", \\"Resistance\\", and \\"MK Ultra\\" sound like normal singles for the band; catchy, epic, and occasionally a bit silly.  A couple tracks incorporate excerpts from classical music and operas, which is a bit pretentious, but doesn't really hurt them.  \\"Guiding Light\\" is the epitome of sounding like they've done this all before.  The key to whether you enjoy this album might hinge on whether you like Muse for their style or just for being a rock band.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the best TV series ever made. I cannot believe that they did not make more seasons. It does an amazing job of taking you way into the future and making it seem like the past, present, and future all rolled into one. The show seemed a little sketchy when i first herd about it, but after watching the first episode i was hooked. You don't have to be a huge sci-fi fan to enjoy this series. It has something for everyone! Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy!!
0385504225|4.0|The thriller is perfect and breathtaking, even if there are some weak points here and there, I mean the lack of professionalism on the side of the CIA. As for that Dan Brown reveals some of the modern techniques the CIA has been using for a while to torture people and at the same time shows how they can very easily overuse their powers and endanger the freedom of other people in the name of national security. It shows also how easy it is to make them panic. The book is doing exactly what the CIA and the criminal use to frighten people into doing what they want. It reveals that some of the top US officers, ministers and representatives, without forgetting the Supreme Court justices and the senators, the generals and the police departments, FBI and CIA, are members of the Freemason movement in absolute secrecy. But then the fact that the book tries to show that these free masons are nothing but the direct descendants of the founding fathers and the framers of the USA is at least excessive, though it is funny to show the beautiful ideological art produced by that political movement to honor and deify - they use the word apotheosis (transformation into a god) in Congress - George Washington and some others. At the time that was pompous, but Napoleon had done the same, but to show that as the acme of freedom and democracy is absurd and the great indifference of the people today about these \\"masterpieces\\" of grandiloquent propaganda is plain sanity. The fact that Dan brown builds the whole novel on the map of Washington DC and the basic freemason symbols and representations that are embedded in  that town is also interesting but definitely excessive, the indifference of people about it today is plain sanity. Dan Brown though goes beyond and turns freemasonry into the full merging of all the various movements that have always existed in the world and that have questioned the ideological and existential dictatorship of one political organization across the millennia. I do not think that the Rosicrucians, the Zoroastrians, the Vedic Rsis, those he calls the original Jews and Christians, the freemasons, the Illuminati and all the others he covers with ... are the same thing. But what's more his harping on the idea that we have to re-discover and go back to the knowledge of the origins of humanity is a plain absurdity that in a way kills the credibility of the novel. It is the basic myth of Marx, the Bible, and the Quran, the belief in some kind of original primival paradise. Marx called it original or primitive communism. Absurd. Man emerged through accidental mutations from animality and the selection of the best mutations by natural conditions enabled the human kind to develop little by little the brain we have, the languages we have, the intelligence we have, etc. Our science being produced by our brains has to be in phase with them and our brains being produced by the surrounding world that selects the mutations have to be in phase with the world, hence our science has to be in phase with the world, but, and that is a big but, it does not reproduce the world: it explains the world by producing a model of that world, and a model is in no way a reproduction. The wheel, used to transport our bodies and goods, is nothing but a model of our legs since it produces the same effect: to transport us from one place to the next. Dan Brown ignores science and only accumulates things that he declares look alike, but comparing is not proving and historians like Eisenman know that the meaning of history can only come from the differences between documents and not from the common points. Yes we are living a transitional phase due to science and technology, due to communication and the economy of knowledge, but not because knowledge has a weight or a material density, but because knowledge is able, when used in exchange and cooperation among people to produce added value and hence to increase the value of our production, of our products, of our goods, hence the wealth of our society. Dan Brown is far from this knowledge economy since he defends the idea that some knowledge has to be kept as mysteries, that is to say something only those who have been initiated can know. That is what is totally unacceptable in the freemason movement, apart from the fact it is a secret society that hides a lot of its inner functioning and members, the fact that it is believing in an elite, in the necessity to entrust the government of the world to an initiated elite. And of course Dan Brown makes some basic mistakes, like telling us there have only been twelve zodiac signs. Wrong. There have been thirteen zodiac signs up to the twelfth or thirteenth centuries in our society (the 11th century thirteenth sign has been put back up on the outside wall of the abbey church of Issoire (France) a few years ago. The thirteenth sign is the serpent bearer, the ancestor of pour caduceis, of medicine, the healer, the bronze serpent of Moses. It's a shame such approximate facts and mistakes are used to support the forty page final lecture which is absolutely useless in the plot and absurd in content. By the way Buddha did not believe in God.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGIDs, hence the wealth of our society.

B001AQTWF2|5.0|I have listened to this album now for over a week and I love it.  Have you taken a listen to the literal crud out there right now.  Whitney may not be the same voice, but she is still a queen nonetheless.  THis album is great.  I like how she tries to be true to herself in her song selection for this album, but still tries to be current.  She does a great job in her song selection.  I would love for Whitney to take a strong try at song writing. Great showing Whitney...keep it coming.
B0019T9FL6|3.0|I fell in love with J-Hud's voice while she was a contestant on American Idol.  She along with Fantasia & Latoya London made up the so-called \\"Three Divas\\" - they are all talented young women and of the three I felt that Jen was the most talented BUT that Fantasia had an undeniable \\"it\\" factor while in comparison Jen needed more seasoning as a performer.  It sure would've been fun to see a Fantasia vs J-Hud finale but it's water under the bridge at this point since both a living their dreams now.<br /><br />I've had to sit with this album for a while and give the songs a chance to \\"marinate\\" before giving my opinion.  As debuts go I think it's ok - the problem for Jen is that fans have heard her and gotten to fall in love with her voice before this album was released and were expecting magic but the songs selected didn't really help her cross over to the wider pop chart audience.<br /><br />I think that once again, Clive Davis was trying to throw a little bit of everything at the listening audience to see which tracks would \\"hit\\", Jen's powerful voice was toned down on a lot of the tracks and some of the tracks seem like throw-aways - not designed to show those who are unfamiliar with Jen exactly who she is as an artist. I didn't mind that a couple of the tracks are gospel oriented because if Aretha Franklin can successfully give us r&b, pop & gospel so can this young woman!<br /><br />My favorite tracks are:<br /><br />GIVING MYSELF - Jen's restrained vocals power this track, there is an alternate sweetness & power to her voice that makes this track interesting<br /><br />SPOTLIGHT - catchy song<br /><br />YOU PULLED ME THROUGH - great power ballad<br /><br />IF THIS ISN'T LOVE - a synth-pop sounding track that's taken some time to grow on me<br /><br />I'M HIS ONLY WOMAN f/ Fantasia - love the pairing of their voices, both unique and distinctive<br /><br />CAN'T STOP THE RAIN - melodic track with great lyrics<br /><br />JESUS PROMISED ME A HOME OVER THERE - touching<br /><br />Another song of note is WHAT'S WRONG (GO AWAY) - this song could've been a great duet IF a real male singer had been paired with Jen (someone like Anthony Hamilton or Tyrese).  This is an example of trying to pair her with someone who is \\"hot at the moment\\" like T-Pain whose vocals ruin this track.<br /><br />Overall I'm happy that Jen was finally able to get a shot in this business and hope that with her next album, there is a thought out focus so that better singles can be selected to really showcase her as the gifted vocalist that she is.ng<br /><br />Another song of note is WHAT'S WRONG (GO AWAY) - this song could've been a great duet IF a real male singer had been paired with Jen (someone like Anthony Hamilton or Tyrese).

0345308239|5.0|Read this along with \\"The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers\\" - see entry. Tuchman was one of the best writers of history ever. She made prose out of what could have been a recitation of dates and events, but was always objective and revisionist only where revisionism was supported by underlying research that at least pointed to the truth.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I am a longtime Beatles collector. Because I have all the original LPs and Cds in Stereo, I decided I would buy the Mono box set. As many Beatle fans know, the Mono mixes are the way the Beatles originally intended the music to sound like. As far as the Stereo mixes are concerned, these were \\"manufactured\\" by the recording engineers in order to enhance the overall sound of the album . As a matter of fact, when the ORIGINAL (1960's and 70's)UK stereo mixes were made, various countries added their \\"two cents\\" in order to create the ultimate Stereo mix for their country. As a result, the Stereo LP that you may have that was manufactured in Germany may sound a bit different than a Japanese pressing of the same title.    If you look on Youtube, there are videos that do side by side comparisons of the mono and stereo \\"Remasters\\" versions of certain song titles. The stereo versions DO sound good. They seem louder and emphasize the bass and drums. There is channel separation so that most of the vocals will come out of one speaker and more of the instrumentation seems to come out of the second speaker. The sound also has an interesting spacey (or sonic) quality. However, the middle layers of sound seem to be missing. (Keep in mind that these REMASTERED STEREO versions sound DIFFERENT than the ORIGINAL STEREO versions made in the 60's and 70's.)    As for the mono versions,they have a much cleaner sound (no sonic layering) and you can hear extra \\"middle range\\" sounds that are absent from the Stereo remixes. The same sounds come out of both speakers. All of the instrumentation is at an equal sound level. The drums and bass sounds are NOT as emphasized but sound equal to the other instruments. Some of the songs themselves appear in slightly different versions as well.    Now for the packaging. the Stereo versions come in nice digi packs that fold out into 3 pannels. They also come with extra picture booklets and a DVD portion that you can play in your computer. (Please note- All these DVD portions are also available to watch on youtube!) The stereo box also has  a DVD that compiles all the visual portions from the cds on to one disc so you can watch it on your DVD player.    The mono box sets are made to duplicate the original LPs down to the last detail. The albums look like mini Lps and do not fold out into 3 panels.Each album comes with a nice inner and outer sleeve. From what I understand, ALL these (limited edition) mono box sets were made in Japan. As a bonus (along with the mono tracks), \\"Help\\" and \\"Rubber Soul\\" contain the original (60's-70's) stereo mixes. The DVD portions are NOT included in the mono box. (Watch them on youtube.)  Also- as many of you already know,some of the later albums are not included in the mono box since no mono mixes were originally created for them.     My advice is to read all the information about each box set version,  listen to excerpts of both versions (which are available on youtube). This will help you make a better decision on which box set to purchase.
B000002UY5|5.0|Someone once asked what my favorite song of all time was.  Thats impossable to answer.  but asked what my favorite album was, I came up with four of five.  Blind melon was in there, I don't feel there are any bad songs on this album.  and only 2 I will skip if i'm not in the right mood.  In my opinion a good album is one you like from start to finish, and it flowes well together.  This is just such an album..
B00127RAJY|5.0|I was very skeptical of the claim to lose so much weight in such a short time, but I can honestly say after a few months of using this DVD, I have lost 20 pounds!  It's amazing how effective and tough this workout is.  At first, I thought I would never make it through the workout.  Jillian is tough.  But stick with it, and you will be amazed with the results.  My friends and coworkers are constantly asking me how I have lost the weight and toned up.  I swear, I owe it to Jillian.  She is no-nonsense, but very motivating.  The 20 minutes go very quickly and the results are worth it!
B001FB4VZS|5.0|Awesome series. Addictive!  Great price on Amazon,if you're patient and wait for a sale.
0060557818|5.0|Neil Gaiman's Neverwhere takes us through the dark, mysterious world of London Below, an underground world where people, things, and in some instances places, end up when they are forgotten and \\"fall through cracks.\\" With a tone of dark british humor and spectacular literary imagery as if the novel itself was written in an abandoned subway station, this book will captivate readers of all types. The novel presents a very strong message about bums and how society tends to ignore or forget them as if they were invisible; such as what happens to Richard Mayhew. I was very skeptical when I first picked this book up. I've never read a Gaiman novel before, and I was never much of a fan of \\"dark fantasy\\" novels. However after reading it in a few days (it's impossible to put down) I find myself constantly looking up Gaiman's other works; I am intrigued by his storytelling abilities. My only complaint with the book is that there isn't a sequel.
0385737424|5.0|I knew very little about this book when I started reading it, and I'm so glad I knew very little. The magic of the book comes from letting it unfold before your eyes. Miranda is a delightful, funny and realistically insightful sixth-grader who lives in New York City in 1979. Her mother works as a paralegal and receives word she has been selected to appear on the $20,000 Pyramid.<br /><br />I loved this book. Miranda is a wonderful narrator, and the story in many ways is timeless. It's setting is 1979, but Stead does not beat it into readers' heads. The time setting is mentioned when it's relevant, and I found myself thinking of the setting as the year I was Miranda's age. Her situation is timeless. The story unfolds from a realistic fiction novel into a mystery and adventure tale. Miranda's favorite book is Madeline L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time, and she looks at the world honestly and with hope. I enjoyed each page, and as the mystery unfolded, I came to love each more than the last. When I finished the book, it stayed with me; the story was still unfolding in my mind. I fully expect this book to get some Newbery buzz.
B002KH4KSY|1.0|I wish you could give LESS than one star, because this dog deserves it. What an awful, painful movie this is to watch. The main characters are hateful -- I wanted to kill them myself, and had absolutely no sympathy for them at all. They bicker and complain at each other for the first hour and ten minutes before the wife finally is silenced. It was like being forced to sit through couples therapy with two people who hated each other. The husband --  who was almost tolerable -- then turns all Vietnam-flashback crazy. The corn kids were creepy, but terrible actors. The little scripture-spouting prophet was the worst, and sounded like he was reading lines he didn't even understand. I truly had to force myself to watch this horrible thing all the way through. Not again. I like the original, and although this version perports to be closer to King's original story (which I read long ago, but don't remember well enough to say if this is true or not -- I certainly don't remember hating the protagnonists as much as I hated the two main characters in this movie!), it was truly and deeply unlikable on many levels. SyFy needs to quit making movies, as they've never once made anything that was even remotely decent.
B001GCUO16|5.0|I originally downloaded this while it was in theaters like many.  I skimmed through it and I was concerned.  I never got around to watching it and decided to wait for the Blu Ray to watch it right - with all special effects in tact.    AllI even read on Amazon or other places is how bad X-Men 3 was.  X-Men 3 was good to me.  Those same people say that this film was bad.  I was expecting a horrible movie, but instead this movie turned out to be hot!!  So don't listen to the haters.  These are the same people who complain about every little thing.  We already know that Hollywood changes commic book movies around, so why get mad?  They may not have played it by the book, but at least we did get to see things that reminded me of the comic, like Wolverine's sheep lined jacket and the cigar!    Like X-Men 3, we get a chance to see characters we probably would not have seen otherwise.  Like Deadpool, Emma Frost (I hopt they do the Hellfire Club...), Gambit and others.  Speaking of which, I never liked Gambit, but this film made me like him.  I could never see why people liked him.  I still don't see it, but at least like him on film!    My only complaint is that it is only an hour and forty minutes.  However, the time seems longer as they did get everything they needed to into the film.  FOr the haters, the movie is about WOlverine and his life, not super action, although that is there too.  It is not about the other characters either.  Be happy they put so many others into thefilm instead of just Wolverine and Sabertooth.  Sbaertooth is another character I did not care for.     This movie is worthy to be in my collection and stand beside X2.  In some ways it is better due to the fact that it came later.  I thought it stupid to do an origins film, but I don't mind more.  Just not in Cyclops.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|I have been a Megadeth fan from the start. For me ENDGAME is the best Megadeth since Countdown to Extinction! Superb song writing, superb guitar work, and superb lineup! If you thought Megadeth would never reach the musicianship they had with Marty, Nick and Jr. you better take a listen to ENDGAME. This is a refreshing new slab of good ol' Megadeth!! Often times you buy a CD and you get 2 or 3 good songs and the rest are filler. Not here, every track on ENDGAME is solid gold! If your question is whether ENDGAME is worth buying or not, the answer is WORTH EVERY PENNY!! ENDGAME will go down in history as one of Megadeth's definitive albums along side RIP and CTE!
0385504225|2.0|As a huge fan of both Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code, I eagerly awaited the next installment.  I have to say, after reading it, it was a bit of a disappointment. The story had a lot of the same plot twists and general themes already used in the previous works.   Langdon is brought into the drama on the way to a lecture, there's the cop that's unclear if they're good or bad, the beautiful female scientist who's family is in trouble, blahblahblah.  Really over all, I had trouble getting engrossed in the story.  At times it was flat out dull.  I found myself skipping ahead a few pages int he hopes that it might get good.    It wasn't the worst thing I have ever read.  But given the other 2 works in the series, it did not meet my expectations.  Perhaps if I had not read the other two and liked them so much, it would not be such a let down.  Still, overall, The Lost Symbol is, in my opinion, mediocre at best.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|I don't even have the album yet, I'm going to get it this weekend and I can tell this album is worth buying. I love Whitney despite all that she went through that is her business. All I worry about is the music and I believe this CD buy Whitney is one of her greatest work. So if you don't have the CD yet like me.....please go out and support Whitney.
B0008ENICU|5.0|This is a great movie.  It's just another example of the original being so much more superior than the remake.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|I have read all of Dan Brown's books and have found each one to be educational as well as a good, solid read, the kind you lose sleep over.  I agrees that he is not the best writer but I find him no more formulaic then Steven King or Michael Crichton. I think his books do lack a good editor; one that will insist on paring out the irritating summery review that is generally reserved for serialized writing where there may be a delay in reading the next section, so the reader requires a reminder.  That being said, the book was engrossing and the riddle tantalizing.  I really love the mixture of real places, organizations, rituals and scholarly writings.  As in all his books, my curiosity is peeked, sending me to Google to do additional research.  I am always amazed at what I learn.  I recommend this book for everyone to read, though there is some startling brutality for the tender of heart.  No worse than everyday TV though so do not let that hinder you.  This book is entertaining and makes you think, as it have at least 3 layers of understanding.  If you have \\"ears to hear\\" you will read it in one setting.  I listened to the unabridged CD audio version first, missing out on the helpful diagrams and pictures found in the book.  The audio version was fairly well done and at one point I was sitting in my car for 20 minutes, unable to disembark until the current predicament was resolved.  Buy them both and Enjoy!
0446618306|3.0|The first two parts of the book are excellent you won't be able to put the book down. The third part is boring and almost doesn't have to do anything with the main plot. If this part had been written in less than 50 pages the book could be wonderful. While reading the last hundred pages you'll forget how good were the first parts.
0385504225|3.0|I agree with several of the people who recently reviewed this book.  Dan Brown is not one of my favorite authors, but I gave this book a try.  I don't know how anyone else felt about the last part of the book, but I thought I was back in my undergraduate days at the university.  Too much talk, too much philosophy for me.  The climax came and yet the book when on endlessly about the \\"mysteries.\\"  Glad I didn't actually buy this book.  My husband is plugging away at it.  Bet he doesn't finish.
B002JODUI4|5.0|Joel has done it again. This album is GREAT from start to finish. I downloaded his last album, Random Album Title, which was when I discovered Deadmau5, and absolutely loved it. But come this time, I wasn't able to find any good copies post-release... but that didn't matter, it was totally worth buying! The way all the songs blend into each other is great, all leading up to the final epic performance of Strobe... love that song. If you loved his last album, or are new to him and just love progressive trance style music in general, you will not be disappointed with this album.
B00006CXSS|5.0|To begin with, I'm not much of a fan of war movies. But my son is interested in WW2 in a big way so I rented BOB to watch over the weekend. And I was stunned. The acting was amazing, the effects, the scenery, but above all, the story of these brave paratroopers blew me away. I can't recommend this highly enough. You don't have to be a fan of historical or war movies. If you're a fan of courage, of bravery, of men who lived through something I can barely comprehend, you should watch this miniseries.  I'll be buying it so I can watch it again and again.

You should not even be able to take a Biology class without having read this book since without understanding Evolution, Biology makes no sense. Get it, Read it, Share it. I would give ten stars if I could.
B0017CW5J4|5.0|Blue Man Group's How to Be a Megastar Live! is great fun in so many ways.  The content is humorous at times and thought-provoking in others.  The music is great as well, blending almost native tone pieces with hard rock and inspiring vocals.  The visual performance ensures your eyes rarely leave the screen.      The sound and visual quality of the recording are stellar.  Deep bass and LFE is almost always present due to the highly percussive nature of the performances, while the rest of the guitars and vocals are extremely clear and precise.  Surround imaging is well steered.  The surround and surround back channels are active and enveloping without being overused.  The most impressive part of this transfer is the great use of dynamic range.  Spoken and non-musical parts of the performance are at appropriately comfortable levels, but when the music picks up so does the SPL.  This may wreak havoc on people listening through tiny TV speakers, but will be greatly appreciated by anyone with a quality HT system.
0743437497|3.0|There is one truly creepy moment in the Stephen King novel The Shining, and it occurs rather late in the book.  In this scene a little boy named Danny is confronted by a memory from the past, not his past mind you, but a scene that has occurred in the place where the boy currently resides, the Overlook Hotel.  As Danny leaves his room, he sees a man dressed in a dog costume standing outside the room.  This \\"dog man\\" serves up a threat: \\"I'm going to eat you up, little boy.  And I think I will start with your plump little [...].\\"  The dog man is of course talking to a hotel guest in the past in prurient fun, but is in fact a real threat aimed at the little boy Danny in the present.      Danny is in fact the key to the whole novel and is the true center of the novel.  This is unlike the Kubrick film in which Danny's father Jack is the center.  Danny possesses a gift called the shining which allows him to have premonitions.  It also allows him to see the psychic residues left behind from previous guests or hotel workers staying at the hotel.  These psychic residues are not just memories but can also be scary things people might have imagined in the hotel.  For example there is a roque lawn on the grounds of the hotel that is planted with hedge animals.  A previous guest hallucinated that these animals had moved.  He died of fright shortly after.  Sometimes memory and the fear combine.  For example, a chamber maid at the hotel possessing the gift of the shining saw a memory of a drowned woman in a bathtub, a crime which had occurred in the hotel's past.  The maid imagines this drowned woman arising form her bathtub and coming after her; that memory is now too stuck in the hotel.  So such events can compound and take on a life of their own with memories feeding the imagination and vice versa.      Cue the Torrance family: Jack the Father, Wendy the Mother, Danny the Son.  The father Jack is a writer.  A writer's true gift is his imagination.  He has a son Danny with thepower of the shining.  Thus together they are a sort of psychic perfect storm when they move into the Overlook Hotel.  The writer's imagination can create horrors; the gift of the shining can make them real.  The Hotel wants them both to stay forever.  What is its strategy to keep them?  Divide and conquer.  The Hotel uses Freudian psychology- the intense love-hate relationship that occurs between fathers and sons.  A son's goal is usually a wish to separate from his mother's and be like his father.  But the father is so masculine that the son feels inadequate and secretly harbors an unspoken hatred for his father.  (I don't buy Freud but perhaps King does.) (The book also doesn't concern itself too much with Wendy, the mother.  The most we find out is that she is most likely an incest survivor which explains why she wants to stay in the emotionally abusive relationship she has with Jack.)    These psychic residues present themselves to the three winter occupants of the hotels but mostly to Danny and his father Jack.  These visions always mirror what they feel and fear.  Jack feels trapped in his life and thus the hedge animals appear to him.  They surround him and bar the path emphasizing that he is forever trapped.  Danny sees the drowned woman in the tub who arises from the bath and tries to choke him.  This of course symbolizes Danny's fear of his mother suffocating/ smothering him similar to the castration he fears from his father (the dog man).  Danny fits in rather snugly to the world according to Freud.      As a horror novel the book isn't scary at all.  One gets a fair portrait of three people and their fears.  There's a lot here, but the problem with the novel is that it isn't proportioned properly.  We get a lot of detail about the characters past and we get a lot of detail about the setting (Does anybody need an inventory of the pantry?).  The horror bits are sort of just sprinkled on.  The characters are all on the verge of madness- at least Jack is, but one never really feels this.  There is too much flash back explanation throwing the reader out of the narrative drive.  This drags down the forward movement of the plot.  Personally I think if the concept of the shining was more limited, the book would have been better.  It should have been people in the hotel that see memories of the hotel.  For example the dog man scene is perfectly executed.  King should have cut out the scary visions coming to life stuff.  I think it's only there so the book could conform to a horror novel (Which is a shame because it's not particularly scary.  The hedge animals are just silly).  But this is the problem with The Shining.  Trying to be both literary horror and a pulp horror novel causes The Shining to fail at both.
B001CDLATE|3.0|Baraka's visuals are absolutely stunning.  They evoke an emotional connection with human cultural and spiritual practices similar to what Planet Earth does with nature.  The image quality of the high-resolution transfer is also nearly pristine.  This is my reference image quality disc for BD playback.  That said, unfortunately, there's I don't find a lot of repeat watching of the full disc based on its content.  While the imagery is beautiful and I'll always have this disc on hand for demos, the lack of narration makes this a one time watch for me... it's a great one time watch, but if you don't plan on using it for home-theater demos, I'd call this a rental for most folks.
0061719544|5.0|The book is a well-written, fast read.  It is interesting, funny and a good story.  Even if I didn't like Craig Ferguson, I would have found the story interesting.  I couldn't put it down.

B000F9RB9Y|2.0|This is a great movie, however blu ray shows a lower then expected resolution and it feels - especially in the opening scene like the studio did not try and remaster the negatives so you see all these old artifacts showing up on the film.  Until its remastered for blu ray and cleaned up so its presentable in this format just stick with the DVD version.
B000X9Q8A4|5.0|As one reviewer stated, to get the full impact of this soundtrack you really do need to watch the movie: the songs are a powerful backdrop to the story line.  Saying that, I found a new respect for many of these Beatles tunes.  Too many times great lyrics and the underlying beauty of the notes are masked by instruments wailing a tad too high with guitars and percussions.  The harmonies on some of these tracks is powerful, and I'll never hear \\"Let It Be\\", \\"Something\\", and \\"Dear Prudence\\" the same.  Who would have guessed Jim Sturgess and Evan Rachael Wood could sing that incredible?  With all due respect to John and Paul the vocals here pump many of these songs to an entire new dimension.  Bono singing \\"I Am the Walrus\\"?  Brilliant.<br /><br />These performers took these classic tunes and made them their own, brining a new voice to something familiar.  The words and general melodies are firmly The Beatles, but the cadence, tempo, harmony and soul of these songs have transferred to a new generation.  Well done.

B002IVLH6A|5.0|When I first listen to the single \\"The fixer\\" I thought that it was an ok song from them... not great but good. Then, after I got the album last weekend and I played it for like three times already I must say that Pearl Jam hit the bull's eye with this record. It's not as hard as \\"Pearl Jam\\" (2006) and yes! it might be more commercial than many others but man!!! awesome commercial music without stop sounding as Pearl Jam. A lot the things going on here reminded me to R.E.M. (a fact that a previous reviewer posted here that makes me thing that I was right). The mellow songs (Just breath and The end) are definitely the most beautiful songs Eddie Vedder has come up with in many years. The lyrics are clever enough to distract you from the fact that they're using in one of them a string arragement... yes!!! Pearl Jam using strings!!! I had never imagine that and man.... it sounds beautiful. On the other hand I believe that songs like \\"Unthougt known\\" and \\"Supersonic\\" were written along with Michael Stipe and Peter Buck (R.E.M.) since they sound so to them. We all know that Eddie Vedder is an R.E.M. admiror so, there's no surprise that he was influence indirectly maybe by them. Funnily enough, last year's R.E.M. album \\"Accelerate\\" has the song \\"Man-sized wreath\\" that i believe was written along with Eddie Vedder because that one sounded so a la Pearl Jam... maybe they trade ideas or favors. Anyway, other songs like \\"Gonna see mty friend\\", \\"Got some\\", \\"Jonnhy guitar\\" and \\"Amongst the waves\\" are tunes that define what Pearl Jam is nowadays: a mature band coming up with great ideas to pull out everytime that are determined to release an album. Aweosome songs and guitar arrangements (personally I find \\"got some\\" guitar parts pretty clever).<br /><br />There's nothing else we can say about Pearl Jam that it hasn't been said before but what I can say is that in times where the music business is going down and many of the new bands are either boring or lack of creativity, i thanks albums like \\"In rainbows\\" (Radiohead), \\"Accelerate\\" (R.E.M.) and now \\"Backspacer\\" (Pearl Jam) to make our days. Long live to Pearl Jam's music!!!!lbums like \\"In rainbows\\" (Radiohead), \\"Accelerate\\" (R.E.M.) and now \\"Backspacer\\" (Pearl Jam) to make our days. Long live to Pearl Jam's music!!!!

B002LVVCIK|1.0|Ok, so here's the lowdown, before jumping to dry conclusion:    1) In this picture, Michael Moore is REALLY MAKING A FOOL OUT OF HIMSELF!    Putting yellow crime scene tape around NYSE and standing in front of AIG building with the money bag is plain stupid, no matter how you slice it. Yes, he is populist, not academic, however, even a media person must make constructive argument to generate interest from a normal thinking human being.    Moreover, by acting this way he is actually alienating his would be supporters. NY Times and New Yorker magazine - not exactly bastions of conservative power - are not generous in their reviews of the film.    2) For the love of God, when will we ever learn to take things seriously?  This means NOT fast tracking through mortgage applications, before signing your name for a hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of debt.  Or actually going to the library or Google to learn SPECIFIC things about financial instruments, interest rates, economic bubbles and so on, as opposed to getting your knowledge from dumbed down CNN reports.    If even half of us did that, trust me, the world would be a BETTER PLACE. Confiscating AIG's executive bonus will not do, trust me.
B000H5TH1Q|5.0|Loved this film, always will!!  VINTAGE DEPALMA, and the mind f&%c of the 80's.  Too cool.

1881273156|5.0|There are numerous relationship books available in bookstores that are accessible for those seeking to find answers to questions in love and relationships. The Five Love Languages address issues that most other books do not consider. I have written a book called Beyond Seduction: Loving Without Limits and highly recommend that those who are in a relationship use the information that Dr. Chapman writes in his Love Languages books and apply it in their own relationships. Dr. Chapman's advice on how to hear your partner and how to feel more heard is applicable in any relationship. The idea of understanding how you feel most heard (through acts of service, quality time, words of affirmation, receiving of gifts or physical touch) make it much easier to express to your partner the means that make you feel more loved and that put your love tank back on full! If you know where your partner is coming from and what language they speak, it is easier to express love in a manner that they feel heard and loved without the extraneous frustration. I believe that Dr. Chapman has a wonderful concept and think that more relationship books should reference his thought processes or promote his books to ensure that couples can work through the serious growth times that we will all experience until we are no longer living.

0061719544|5.0|On the back jacket of this book, David Letterman's advance praise states: \\"Craig Ferguson is so much more than a talk-show host.\\"  He is MOST DEFINITELY right about that!!  If you are a fan of the Late Late Show, this is a MUST READ.  There is a whole 'nother side to this man other than the quick & witty Scottish funny guy we have come to endear.  His journey to becoming a late night talk host is absolutely captivating.  I dont' want to give anything away, so I'm just going to say PICK UP THIS BOOK, and go to one of his last book signings like I did and meet the guy!
B002EWD08Q|5.0|Stunning, stunning, stunning. Bought this a few weeks ago and was lucky enough to see them live in Milwaukee, where they played virtually the entire album. The Arctic Monkeys' best to date in my humble opinion and about as far removed from Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not as it is possible to get.. Humbug is definitely an excursion into  the dark side, but is even better for it. The first three tracks are absolute barnstormers and set the tone for the rest, of which Cornerstone is the pick.    Alex Turner is growing into the greatest songster out of the UK since Gallagher and Ashcroft.
B0027CSKQU|5.0|Hard to believe this is over 20 years old. Putting this remastered version of The Stone Roses on the stereo was instant heaven once again, only this time heaven looked, and sounded, even better.    First off I'll say that Ian and co. did a great job on the packaging. Giving this release some much needed heft (it is heavy) They not only boosted the demo tracks, LP's, booklet, art prints, and live dvd, but they did it in a very handsome package. The outer slipcase feels like a large clothbound novel, and even the lettering on the cover gets the gold stamped treatment. The real joy of course is the remastering of the debut record itself. This is not the standard rush and clip job here. Each track is handled with respect and care an album of this nature deserves. Sure the vinyl could have stretched out a bit into a double LP, but what you get is on 180, and plenty nice for anyone's picky ears. The live dvd looks and sounds better than it did, the demos (some of which even I hadn't heard till now) are amazing to hear. Again, each of the CD's levels sound great and these versions give a noticible level boost to any previous issues, all without sacrificing the quality of the mastering.    In short, if you love this record (it's in my all time top 25), then I can think of no better version to own than this one. Simply superb handling of this landmark debut record in every way.

B002GZQYMK|5.0|What can I say? At this point, Muse doesn't surprise with the high level of their albums. From the very first to the very last track, I was delighted to hear different beats and sounds, making every song different from the other one.     It starts with very electric sounds that changes into very sticky beats. But the cherry of the pie comes at the ends with a great symphony divided into 3 sections or songs.     Once again, Muse is experimenting like no other band in this genre and being successful at it.
B001O8C5KK|3.0|Although my initial impression in listening to this version of Puccini's Madama Butterfly was generally positive, my eventual conclusion is that this is a dispiriting performance. This is surprizing given the participation of Gheorghiu in the title role. While I normally enjoy her singing, here Gheorghiu hardly sounds like a vulnerable youthful, oriental girl. Although she makes the \\"right noises\\", her interpretation is lacking in character. The same can be said of Jonas Kaufmann, the latest hot tenor, as Pinkerton. Pappano conducts well enough, but I find the results he elicits from  the Santa Cecilia Orchestra unmemorable. Generic might be the best summation of this performance.<br /><br />On listening to the finest of the competitors on disc, we enter an entirely different world. Take Toti del Monte's Butterfly (Rome 1939/Naxos) - now here is an echt sounding youthful, vulnerable oriental. Furthermore there is Maria Callas's brilliantly sung and acted 1955 interpretation with Karajan's characterful accompaniment. Listen also to Mirella Freni's less pointed but superior vocalism in the Decca/Karajan gold plated but langourous Vienna version.<br /><br />The same can be said for Gigli, Gedda and Pavarotti who take the role of Pinkerton in the aforementioned recordings. Their stylish and expressive singing runs rings around Kaufmann. The great is the enemy of the good.<br /><br />Postscript (7 weeks later): Given that this set was selected as the Gramophone Opera CD of the year, I relistened to it.  My assessment of Pappano's conducting was too severe; his conducting is better than competent but not stellar. I continue to find Kaufmann's voice uningratiating and lacking in character, particularly when under pressure. My feelings concerning Gheorgiu's Butterfly have not changed. It is interesting how people experience music (and in fact anything) differently.
0393324818|4.0|All the recent reviews state that they are not baseball fans.  The book is well written and has a great mini-story on Bill James.  One problem:  The philosophy of Billy Beane hasn't come to fruition.  In fact, in retrospect, it was excellent pitching that made the Oakland As contenders year after year.  During Billy Beane's years as GM, correct me if I'm wrong, but they've won 1 playoff series.
1881273156|4.0|I bought this book for my significant other and me to read together. Since we have both been married before I thought this would help our relationship start off on the right foot. I think the information is so practical and sounds so simple, but often we don't think in terms of what our partner considers acts of love. We often give love as we like to receive it, not imagining that they may not feel the same way. It is a good way to begin a meaningful conversation.

0385504225|3.0|Dan Brown hasn't lost the ability to write breathless action and countless plot twists, but both the action and the twists will be very familiar to those who have read The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons.  Replace Mal'akh with the Assassin or the Albino, and little is lost.  The Masons start to blend in with the Illuminati and the Templars.  Langdon has the necessary tag-along love interest, and together they carry an item that reveals a maze of hidden meaning in a large city.  The only real difference is you feel that less is at stake in this novel.  The threat that Langdon is trying to prevent doesn't materialize until very late in the book, which for the first few hundred pages makes you wonder why we're paying such close attention.  Some people criticize the very end of the book (i.e., after the action-filled climax), but I found those pages to be the most enjoyable.  It was the first time where the pacing of the book slowed down, and Dan Brown's thoughts were given room to breathe...and they were compelling.  But those touching pages come too late to save the book as a whole.  In the end, the book comforts you to let you know that Dan Brown can find a layer of mystery in well known places and wrap an exciting story around it, but it makes you wonder why it took him 6 years to write such a formulaic effort.
0763631205|5.0|When I was a child my father would read A Christmas Carol to me during the week before Christmas. I had been trying to find an unabridged, beautifully illustrated edition to read to my granddaughter. I finally found it in this magnificent rendition of the great Dickens tale. This is a book that is sturdy enough to pass to multiple generations with pride and share the real spirit of Christmas. It also makes one appreciate the elegance of Victorian grammar. I recommend it wholeheartedly.
0385504225|1.0|Having enjoyed both angels and demons and the da vinci code, i was looking forward to another intriguing thriller from dan brown.  Unfortunately what I got was formulatic plot with painfully obvious plot twists discovered even before midway through the book.  there was absolutely nothing original about this story and the ending was ludicrous.  why all the hoopla for such a so-what secret.  and that in a nutshell is what is core problem with the book.  you get to the secret revealed and your reaction is...so what.  the masons created a whole intricate and elaborate myth to protect a secret that is...not really a secret?  what??  why don't i write a book about the rufifarians - a secret sect of some order who through a convoluted series of puzzles and maps and secrets keep a precious and ancient secret...and the ending reveals that...the secret is...water is refreshing.  yes, the ending was that bad of a let down.  do not waste your time on this drivel.  if i could go negative stars i would.
0385504225|2.0|Unfortunately, the new book by Dan Brown is a massive letdown. I don't have a problem if an author is sticking to a sucessful formula, but in \\"The Lost Symbol\\" Brown really only changes the setting of the plot and some minor details. The set of characters - good and evil - stays almost the same.    The book's major problem is that Brown is not very good at inventing a coherent story. The plot in \\"Symbol\\" is paper-thin, actually almost nothing really happens despite some uninteresting and seen-before running through Washington (which unlike Rome or Paris in the previous books never really comes to life). Characters act like they are stupid to no end - worst of all Langdon, who after all he's seen in the last book still can't believe that they're after some big secret (almost as if he's read the final pages of the book himself) and always starts discussing this with the other characters, something that's boring the first time but happens endlessly throughout the book. Also, the information dumping at times almost gets unbearable. Even minor and uninteresting facts are explained in unnecessary detail and these lectures make the book very boring very fast.    The biggest mistake Brown makes - and one that every other writer would probably be asked to rewrite by his publisher - is the identity of the bad guy. This is a plot twist obvious beyond belief. I really don't get why no one said 'Come on, every kid is going to notice from the beginning who this is!'...    The book takes a few pages / chapters (that's almost the same with Dan Brown books) to start getting interesting, but for some hundred pages near the middle makes for a good page turner. The story does take a turn for the worse pretty fast after that though, and the ending is horrible and laughable at best. I really almost couldn't read the last 30 pages, they were so boring and stupid.    That being said, the book is not the worst of all time. It has its weaknesses and is full of wasted chances, but manages toremain entertaining for most of the time. Maybe if someone else had invented a good story and Brown had only done research and some writing, this would certainly have been better.    If you're a fan of Brown, you may enjoy this book, altough to a much lesser extent than the previous one. But for most people it will be a big disappointment.

0061719544|5.0|If you've ever seen or heard Craig Ferguson, one thing is painfully clear immediately: aside from him being incredibly funny, he isn't from around here. Yes, Ferguson is from Scotland, as his very thick accent illustrates. Yet from a very early age, a young Ferguson made it his goal to move to America. Happily, for him and for us, he became an American citizen in early 2008. And although this is joyous news, his road getting here was full of anything but laughs.    It would be very easy for Ferguson to simply put out a laughing book, highlighting the funny bits of his journey from gray and dreary Cumbernauld, Scotland, to the glittering flashbulbs of the paparazzi in sunny Los Angeles. To be sure, there are moments in AMERICAN ON PURPOSE that are laugh-out-loud funny, but ultimately he refuses to gloss over his failures. And in the process of opening himself up so honestly, he shows the spirit of perseverance and dedication required to get through his often challenging life.    Beginning with his tough childhood, doing whatever it took not to get beat up in his rough and tumble school, he found an outlet in punk rock as a drummer. He also found a release from continued failures in numerous liquor bottles and drug stashes. But a trip to New York City in the '70s with his father opened his eyes to the larger world, and at that moment he realized that he wanted to be an American. Right then and there, he promised his father that one day America would be his home.    Back in Scotland, however, the drinking and the drug usage were taking their toll, leaving a swath of broken hearts and failed ventures in his wake. It would all culminate on a Christmas Day decision to end his life after he was stranded with no way home and no prospects of which to speak. Ironically, it would be a bartender offering a glass of sherry for the holiday that saved his life by getting him so drunk that he forgot to kill himself.    Ferguson is honest about the destructive nature of his ways inthose tough days, and he takes the brunt of the blame square on the nose. It would be easy for him to brush aside the situations in the retelling, but he makes it very clear that these were his choices, his cravings and his needs. It was his conscious decision to perform those deeds no matter whom he hurt along the way. This part of Ferguson's story is a frank discussion of addiction and dependency, and artfully shows the pitfalls of leading such a life.    Thankfully, Ferguson finally cleans up and makes it big in the United States, going from hit television series \\"The Drew Carey Show\\" to succeeding comedian Craig Kilborn as the host of \\"The Late Late Show.\\" It was on this program that he eulogized each of his parents after they passed away, and it was in those heartfelt and touching moments that the real Craig Ferguson emerged. He recounts the loss of his parents in the book, and the closing chapter about the death of his mother is perhaps the most poignant of all. Within those pages (tinged with grief over his loss), Ferguson realizes that, in his quest to be American, he was losing his grip on what it meant to be Scottish. And it is at this point that he determines he is and rightfully must be both.    AMERICAN ON PURPOSE is an astoundingly good book by perhaps the funniest talk show host on television. And although Ferguson is funny, the book's narrative is no joke; he knows how to write. His style is very conversational and open, and that helps the reader to easily delve into it. The book will surprise you with its honesty, sadden you with its destructive pattern of behavior, and, as Ferguson always does, make you laugh.        --- Reviewed by Stephen Hubbard
B000NA28IE|1.0|Spoilers, ahoy.    Well.  This was quite the disaster.  I've been reading the books for several years, and purposely didn't see the movie when it was in theaters because I kept hearing bad things about it.  Curiosity got the best of me the other day, however, and I rented it.    I'm not exaggerating when I say 90% of the movie was inaccurate.  It all began with a butchered pronunciation of \\"Alagaesia.\\"  When there's a pronunciation guide in the back of the book, there's just no excuse for that.  One could argue that the writer/director/producer/whatever didn't know how to pronounce it because they didn't read the book, but let's at least give them the benefit of that particular doubt.    For my fellow book fans: Eragon was fine, but everyone else was completely out of character.  Roran skips town because he's old enough to be recruited into the Empire's army, and he ain't down with forced military service.  Brom wasn't wise or very helpful.  Arya flirts with Eragon in every scene they have together AND her ears aren't pointy (which isn't her behavior, but still).  And, the icing on the cake, Murtagh shows Eragon how to find the Varden. I know.    What could've been a slower-paced epic like Lord of the Rings ended up being a jumbled mess, zipping through scenes fast enough to give me whiplash.  A 500+ page book was squeezed into an hour and 45 minutes.  A lot of important plot points were removed, too, making it practically impossible to ever make a sequel without re-doing this one first.  Actually, that's an idea I could get behind.    If you're after a GOOD dragon story, stick to the books.
0385504225|4.0|I don't think I can recall a book that has been as widely and thoroughly anticipated as THE LOST SYMBOL by Dan Brown. I know, I know...that Potter kid has a lot of fans who stood in line at midnight for the privilege of being the first on their block to possess the latest volume. But it has been six years since THE DA VINCI CODE was published, and folks were overdue for the next installment. So here it is: the return of Harvard's own symbologist Robert Langdon in roughly 500 pages of him in a battle of wits with a truly deranged villain played out against the backdrop of Washington, D.C.     THE LOST SYMBOL takes place over a period of 10 hours or so in the Washington D.C. area, predominantly downtown. Langdon, being somewhat unfamiliar with America's capital, is a fish out of water. His presence is the result of a request of his old friend, Peter Solomon, to make a last-minute address at a private gala presented by the Smithsonian Institution. What begins as an attempt to help a friend, however, becomes a race against time. Langdon is forced to follow an enigmatic series of clues to obtain the solution to a puzzle that is believed to have the power to unleash a heretofore hidden and closely guarded secret. The guardians of this secret are the Masons, an order that is both publicly known and shrouded in mystery.    Langdon follows an ancient, clandestine and bloody trail across Washington, commencing with a grisly object displayed in the Capitol Building. While following the clues around the city, Langdon is pursued by the CIA, who seems bent on stopping him at any cost. The result is a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse as Langdon and Solomon's sister, Katherine, chase down a series of codes and symbols, some familiar and some going back to the beginning of recorded history. And the strings of this deadly game are being pulled by the imposing Mal'akh, a giant demon of a man who is truly deranged.    Langdon must use all of his skills and knowledge to stop Mal'akh, prevent the death of his friend, Peter, and foil a plan that culminates with the toppling of the United States government. As forces both old and new converge on one of Washington's most unusual structures, the fate of many hangs in the balance as a madman's carefully calculated plan comes near success with only Langdon --- in an uneasy partnership with one of the United States' most powerful agencies --- standing in his way.    Has it been worth the wait? Overall, yes. But that's not to say that the book is without its shortcomings. For one, THE LOST SYMBOL could easily have been a hundred pages shorter since it tends to drag occasionally, usually when Brown shows his research hand a bit too much. And there is one segment between the climax and the ultimate conclusion where Brown prattles on a bit too long. Additionally, there are a couple of points where credibility is strained, not unlike what one might be inclined to believe watching an episode of \\"24.\\" I'm not sure how some of the characters couldn't figure out the identity of Mal'akh, the imposing and frightening villain of the piece, a bit sooner. And there are a few moments where injuries are seemingly healed way too quickly, so everyone can move from a life-threatening situation to just hours later touring national monuments without a stop at a medical facility in between for a few days of rest and relaxation. You'll understand once you read the book.    But be warned: after reading THE LOST SYMBOL, it will be almost impossible to resist a long and leisurely trip to Washington, D.C to visit the places that Brown so skillfully weaves and elegantly describes throughout his narrative. He clearly did his research, and he enjoys sharing it with readers. Although he vividly illustrates both the city and Langdon's brilliance, the most riveting character is Mal'akh, who becomes more frightening, bizarre, and yes, memorable as one delves more deeply into the novel. And while THE LOST SYMBOL lacks some of the more controversial aspects of THE DA VINCI CODE (the most powerful group in the book, the Masons, are portrayed as good fellows here, and religion in general is attacked half-heartedly when attacked at all), it is doubtful that you'll ever look at a dollar bill or D.C. the same way again.        --- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub
B00009YXHN|2.0|Ok, of all the Re-Animator movies, this one is by far the worst, it has its moments and even some laughs, but all the movie is, is a rip-off of The bride of Frankenstein.  The old story of man loses girl friend, but mad scientist keeps dead girl's heart and builds a body around the frozen heart, with of course the help of the girl's boyfriend.  I don't think his was what H.P. Lovecraft had in mind when he wrote the story about the Re-Animator and I think he turned over in his grave when this movie was released.  Even Jeffery Combs could not save this one, it is too predictable and lame.  The original Re-Animator and Beyond the Re-Animator are pretty good and worth owning, this was was the flat tire of the bunch.  Back to the Drawing board Doc!
1416594787|5.0|This is certainly the most comprehensive exposition of evolution to date and it is breathtaking in its scope and astonishing detail.  But one question can be asked: Is the classification of life forms the history of life forms? One can only classify what one can observe and to posit the classification of life forms for the history of life forms seems to be scientifically untenable and scientifically invalid.     But it is not his superb knowledge of evolution and the validity of that knowledge that is in question, but his insisting that his engrained atheism has its basis in  the fact of evolution.      You can't find God at the end of a microscope or at the end of a syllogism; you discover God at the end of reality itself as the only explanation for that reality.  Dr. Dawkins has enclosed his mind in the changes and processes of nature, as if the changes and processes of nature explained the existence of what is changed.  His science never grapples with the problem within the problem: not why the cosmic egg is white or changes into an atom, a cosmos or a chick, but where the cosmic egg came from in the first place.

L.A Candy feels like a poorly written diary entry that tries to be \\"hip\\" with lots of likes, as in, like...you know? And her need for parenthesis to develop characers' pasts is immature writing at its worst. Save yourself a boring read and stick with the show if that's the kind of drama you want. The writers of her show are a hell of a lot more interesting than this.
6303942830|5.0|Saw this many years ago when it came on TV, and debated whether to get VHS or DVD. The reviews for DVD said that certain things were different or were missing so I bought the VHS. Very happy with the VHS that was brand new and unopened until the last 45 minutes when it became jumpy. The color was brilliant, the picture was clear, just that last 45 minutes I couldn't get it to track consistantly even though I was trying manually to do it. It was really wonderful to see the movie again and from about a decade later with older children. We all love history and how our country came to be, and this story seems to bring out the drama of it and the lives of the not so ordinary but every day people that were called to play the parts they did at that time in history. Great scenery, great plot, great actors and actresses, and some very tender moments on top of it all. One of our favorites!!
B0000CDJPQ|2.0|I purchased this adapter couple weeks ago to connect a firewire audio device to my new Mac Book. It works fine, so no complaints there. However, when you attach the firewire 400 cable end to this adapter, the two becomes pretty long, so it gets really easy to tilt it up/down/right/left when it's connected to the laptop. So, it becomes really difficult to move your laptop when this is connected. Not only it can get disconnected easily, which I've already experienced couple times, it can actually DAMAGE your firewire 800 port if you don't be too careful.     After having this problem, I made more search and found another similar adapter built by Moshi, where the two jack are separated by a short cable, so it can give much more flexibility, so I'm about to buy that. I do not recommend this product of Sonnet.
0439023491|5.0|You wont be disappointed with this second book.

I will admit that perhaps my idea of what the book should be is influenced by the film.  I was introduced to PKD as a kid by the Ridley Scott film.  Dick seems out of his element when it comes to gun play and action sequences.  He writes like a guy who's sitting in his apartment and has never fired a gun, and while he's doing his best to describe the event and the aftermath, he doesn't quite get there.  There's no adrenaline, no suspense, but only a fumbling and rather hamfisted account that really doesn't even seem logical.  Deckard is having a rather pleasant conversation with the Baty's while exchanging laser fire with them?  The treatment of the andys is aslo perplexing.  I actually think the film handles their motivations and reasoning better than the novel.  But, I will say that the Pris/Rachel relationship is brilliant, as is Rachel's relationship and motives regarding Deckard.  This is a good novel in my opinion, but not one of PKD's best.

He looks way more unrealistic that he does in the original version. He looks too much like Jar-Jar Binks and Dobby (from Harry Potter). And then, there are the \\"edits\\" that have been made. You probably know what's wrong here: replacing weapons with talkie-talkies, replacing the word \\"terrorist\\" with \\"hippie,\\" editing out the word \\"[...],\\" etc. Why couldn't they just leave this film alone and leave it the way it is? The great original is the one that should be watched, not the new 2002 version where it is dominated by political correctness. The 2-Disc Limited Collector's Edition is no longer in stock, so you'll have to find used DVD's. Why? Because it's the only edition that has the original 1982 version.

B001OGNOES|5.0|Testament has been around for almost as long as Metallica, and Iron Maiden, yet have to date no commercial success, and could almost be billed as the Anvil of the Bay area thrash scene.  How is it possible for one of the most influential metal bands to be completely unknown to almost everybody but the most hardcore metal fan.  What a conundrum.  If anything it speaks to the depravity of the metal fan who let legendary bands, such as Testament, Overkill, Exodus, Death Angel, Etc. go completely unnoticed while their fellow act, Metallica sells a hundred million albums and enters the rock and roll hall of fame.  Ridiculous.        The New Order is a must have for all fans of thrash, and if you consider yourself one, and don't have it, reconsider yourself, and go follow the Jonas Brothers.  This release is as metal as it gets with classics such as Eerie Inhabitants, The New Order, Trial By Fire, and just about every other song on the album.        Testament starts to slowly move away from the classic horror, and occult themes they sang about in their first album, and gets a little political with some of their lyrical content, yet still remains completely metal.  Which is pretty much where they have stayed with their expressive implication; a little demonic, a little real life, and totally brutal.  This is probably Testament's best classic album, and should be a part of every metal heads library.

B00138EYG4|5.0|I had to rethink what I knew about metal when I heard this CD, because it was easily as metal as anything Metallica, or Iron Maiden had done up to that point, and still remains as one of the greatest if not the greatest metal offering from any band.  If you say Master of Puppets, I say hell ya, If you say 666, or Appetite, or Reign in Blood, I say amen, but Painkiller is just as good, maybe better than any of them.        Judas Priest was already one the better and more successful metal bands before this album, but they were starting to get pushed aside, and forgotten due to younger, faster, and more brutal bands.  You almost could have dismissed them as an eighties rock or glam band such as fellow European act Scorpians.  Then came Painkiller.  One of the fastest, most technical, and ferocious albums to date, yet still containing all the vintage Priest qualities, this was and is an album that old school, and new school metal fans can embrace.              This CD shreds.  From the start of Painkiller, through Hell Patrol, Leather Rebel, Metal Meltdown, and Night Crawler, the screaming guitars of Glenn Tipton and K. K. Downing dominate you along with the  banshee scream of Rob Halford, as well as the punishing rhythm section.  Metal at its finest.       If you like metal, like I do, this is a must have, easily one of the best albums in all metal.
B00004ZD69|4.0|Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven being GYBE's second studio album and 2000 release reminds me of many experimental bans that I have heard before,i.e., Laibach, Yes, Kraftwerk, Einsturzende Neubauten, Pink Floyd and Grateful Dead. The use of samples also reminds me of Skinny Puppy. The booklet is very strange. With basically no information inside and a strange letter written by the band. Allmusic (4/5) and Pitchfork Media (9/10) both gave it high marks and I agree with this assessment. The album is not easy listening and is very challenging but also extremely rewarding and definitely cutting edge without sounding pretentious. 4/5.
1573223085|5.0|Right-brain jobs, in addition to left-brain jobs, can also be outsourced from the first world to the third world, especially to Latin America and perhaps Africa, because of a lower labor cost and perhaps better quality in selected cases. This is due to the fact that, unlike in the first world, our right-brain qualities have not become attrophiated by an excess of left-brain labor for centuries. I would imagine that there is much such right-brain outsourcing already occurring with Mexico. Therefore outsourcing from the first world to the third would continue for ANY kind of job, not just menial left-brain jobs; however, specific niches can be kept safely in the first world at first world wages requiring specific combinations of both sides of brain activity.    One clear example are doctors. Lots of California patients go to Mexico for visits to doctors who have great right-brain training from the University and have completed specialized left-brain specializations in the US, at a fraction of the US cost. Vemezuelan doctors who seek a better living in the US also have that profle.    Workers in India are highly motivated to excel in outsourced left-brain jobs. I do not know much on Indian culture, but my guess is that they concluded that millenia of emphasis in the right brain failed to provide the abundance they yearn, so Indians are slowly finding the way to overcome that lack.    Daniel Pink's A Whole New Mind establishes a left-brain kind of routine questionnaire for any new business endeavor, I will attempt to reply to it based on my specific Venezuelan environment:    Question 1) The question on \\"Can it be produced abroad more cheaply?\\" is yes for pretty much every single Venezuelan industry but oil. We suffer an exchange control regime that forces exporters to convert their dollars at the official rate of 2.15 bolivars, while the market exchange rate approximately triples this value. That is, Venezuelan products are competitive worldwide only if they can be produced locally at below 30% of the production cost for that item in any single other country. We are even becoming coffee importers! We are importing most foodstuffs for that reason. Local manufacturing industries are migrating to Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica and Brazil. On these grounds, we are quite hopeless until there is an exogenous change of government regulation systems.    Question 2) In the Venezuelan case only the question on \\"Can a computer do it cheaper?\\" can be replied similarly as when asked to a US citizen.    Question 3) The question on \\"Will my product satisfy the needs on an age of abundance?\\" must be reversed in my country. GDP per capita has substantially decreased during my lifetime. In the 60s and 70s any college graduate landed a job and could buy a comfortable home on credit. Today, lots of middle-aged people continue living with their parents. Grocery shopping consumes about half of most people's income, due to one of the greatest inflation rates of the world. I remember when I was a kid it was an age of abundance, but now this is no doubt an age of scarcity. I do not know what, in my local situation, would be an appropriate rephrasing of that question number 3.    In short, Venezuelans need to apply a lot of right-brain creativity in order to come up with a similar \\"recipe questionnaire for success\\" specific for our situation. Maybe we won't come up with such a recipe yet.    The fresh emphasis on right-brain qualities is appropriate to the US situation. I am just not sure on how that Conceptual Age can take a general hold in the developed world, on the current globalization/illegal immigration climate, with so many other countries still living under scarcity. I do not think, seriously, that the abundance assumption is valid. The world is still quite far from being a place of abundance. It will be interesting to see what Cubans within Cuba, if they had the right to speak freely, would add to this respect.    A topic for further research would be to find out if there are any left-brain activities that may be needed worldwide in order to achieve the abundance prerequisite for the Conceptual Age overturn of the Information Age.

0385342020|5.0|After reading a few so-so reviews on Amazon, I started apprehensively reading this book...and found that I was really enjoying it.  I don't frequently laugh out loud while reading anything but I laughed so much at this one that I pretty much told my husband the entire plot (because he had to know what it was that was so funny!).<br /><br />I've read all of Sophie Kinsella's books and this is definitely the funniest one, from my perspective.  The main character's (Lara) ghost Aunt Sadie had fire, and I like to imagine that's what my grandparents were like when they were younger too!  Every time I thought a situation couldn't get more awkward....it managed to get more awkward.<br /><br />All that being said, it is chick-lit and you have to suspend belief in reality to really enjoy it.  If you've enjoyed shows like Medium, Ghost Whisperer, Charmed, Buffy, etc and if you like chick lit, then definitely give this book a try.

6305069611|2.0|I saw this when it came out (oddly, in German, where I was living) and as a big scifi fan who loved Walkabout, I wanted to see it again in English to get all the nuance.  Alas, I found it positively boring and incomprehensible.  An alien comes to Earth, though it is never explained what he is trying to do.  He gets sucked into a relationship with an alcoholic waitress, becomes an alcoholic himself, and then becomes a prisoner of scientists.<br /><br />There are some tantalizing details, such as his flashbacks to his home planet, a desert, but overall it doens't quite get the viewer (or me) to the point that I could believe it while I watched it.  Instead, I just found it weird and cryptic, less that it left things to the viewer to interpret than that it was not cogent and poorly fitted together.  It also simply isn't entertaining whatsoever:  there are odd silences, slow scenes that seem to have no purpose, and absoletely minimal humor or even psychological realism.  (Compare that to, say, Close Encounters, which is an intricate masterpiece, where every occurrence can be coherently explained and deeply felt.)<br /><br />Finally, though the cast is full of talented actors, who Bowie definitely is, their acting is utterly flat.  This is inexplicable to me - Walkabout is one of the best films I have ever seen - as the director is clearly brilliant and unorthodox.<br /><br />Not recommended.  I thought it was perfectly boring and awful.
