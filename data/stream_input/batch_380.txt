B00000I07P|5.0|I have seen Garth Brooks in concert (it was awsome).I have been to see aerosmith,metallica,rolling stones,Dave mathews band and lots of other great bands in concert and liked them all,but the best show i have been to is BON JOVI.The sound and the energy is second to none and thats how i feel about Slippery When Wet.This album has everything a great album should.You want numbers? Almost 25 million copies sold worldwide shows that this album did not just relate to the times (80s),it related to everyday people around the world.The songwriting is great and the songs still hold up.This review is more for Bon Jovi critics who insist on telling us why we shouldn`t like Bon Jovi and should listen to bands like pearl jam(a good band)and others who are not so upbeat.Fan or no fan this album is a clissic.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I loved this set and i cant believe it only lasted one season<BR>GAH soo soo sad one of the funniest shows fox has ever had
B0000TB01Y|4.0|I have to admit that when I first bought this CD, I thought that I'd wasted my money. Except for &quot;Popular&quot; and &quot;Defying Gravity,&quot; which I'd heard before, I felt the rest of the songs weren't memorable. Then I read a review that said the same thing, but the writer listened to it again she loved it. So I did, and lo and behold, I loved it too. I gave it only 4 stars because there's a few songs that aren't even really needed or very good (&quot;Something Bad,&quot; &quot;Dear Old Shiz&quot;) but the rest of the songs are just fantastic. A helpful hint - if you haven't seen the show (like I haven't) I'd suggest you find at least a brief synopsis otherwise you'll be very lost regarding why they're singing about what. <br />Some of the songs are a bit dark, but really breathtaking. And the lighter, humorous songs are great and you'll be humming them for days. My favorite songs are: &quot;The Wizard and I&quot; (Idina Menzel really belts it out), &quot;What Is This Feeling&quot; (really funny and a great tune), &quot;Popular,&quot; &quot;Defying Gravity&quot; (these two are arguably the best two of the show), &quot;Wonderful&quot; (a cute vaudeville-like number) and &quot;For Good&quot; (poignant, beautiful, get ready to cry). I recommend this CD to anyone who loves Broadway musicals. You're in for a rare treat!
6305313687|4.0|Following the openning murder scene, I could not keep my eyes off the screen, because I was watching so much of what I've seen in modern society.  The racism was very much familiar.  Not just the poor little black slave living in the projects because big bad white america is supressing them, but it shows the hatred of the blacks towards the white and vise-versa.  The extremes of their racial hate was provoked by their own anger in general, therefore they imply the negative energy in racism (they come to realise).  While the racism was portrayed in an exagerated extreme manner, the over all message hit close to home.  There was one steryotype, however, that was particualarly getting on my nerves.  The characters constant implication that conservatives are Nazi facists out to supress minorities and those with liberal views are more interested with raical untiy.  Give me a break.  That aside, I loved \\"American History X\\"
B00009QG73|5.0|I knew and liked a few of their songs, so rather than pick one album &quot;out of the blue,&quot; I bought this DVD when I came across it.  I've always found it easier to get into a band by seeing a concert (whether live or recorded), and that was definitely the case here.  <br />I hate to sound like I'm shilling for them, but after watching this DVD thirty times (or more), I went out and bought all of their albums, based on the strength of the performaces here.  And though I love the albums, with several songs I still prefer the more energized live performances here to the original studio recordings -- that's how strong it is.<br />Technically, the direction's smooth and understated (no tenth-of-a-second MTV quick-cut crap here), the video is saturated and near-perfect in recording quality, and the audio is just gorgeous -- a great, professional-quality live recording that  sounds neither weak or overproduced.<br />Anyhow, if you're of a similar mind -- you know a few of their songs, and/or you like elegant pop/rock music that pushes the envelope a bit without being pretentious, and/or you're a fan of live music in general -- I'd definitely recommend that you put this DVD on your short list.<br />Cheers.
B000002MUN|5.0|for anyone who likes petty this is it. the best of the best. this album really catches all of tom's music ability from the folk tunes to the rock to the blues it's all here. this disk is one of my regulars that doesn't leave my changer.
B0000AM6K2|4.0|&quot;1972,&quot; the fine craftsmenship of Josh Rouse is not only an excellent way to come to appreciate this fine singer-songwriter, but to also take a trip back to a great era of rock'n'roll.  <BR>From the opening of the title track, you can just sense that you are not listening to a run of the mill album of 2003, but rather a chance to go back to a time that you may not have been alive for, but can totally understand and not feel displaced.<BR>With appropro backings by the Sweathogs and instrumentation that leads you along those winded city streets and into a pool hall or maybe the arms of the one that had it all feel right.  No worries just good times, genuinely without overproduction or loss of sincerity.  A well worked album that delivers with each listen.
B00007BH5C|5.0|&quot;Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers Sdtk.&quot; is great music to signify the next chapter to a highly successful trilogy.  Oscar winner Howard Shore wrote this score beautifully.  To keep the theme throughout every chapter, this score revisits some pieces from &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, namely &quot;Foundations of Stone&quot; and &quot;The Uruk-hai&quot;.  Every song blends perfectly with every movie event that it's accompanying.  Whenever it's war, love, fear, or struggle, the compositions remain at the fullest potential.  They are great for listening, even without the movie.  Every musical note has the intensity to force listeners to feel it in their hearts.  &quot;Gollum's Song&quot;, performed by Emiliana Torrini, is a great song to end the album.  Her voice is beautiful.  &quot;Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers Sdtk.&quot; is a great album for those looking for a deeper movie connection.  This is sure to please many listeners as certain compositions will become classics in the following years.  Movie fans should also buy the soundtracks of the other two chapters: &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and &quot;The Return of the King&quot;.  Such listening combination makes a great musical journey.
B0000CABBW|4.0|Whale Rider is named after the mythical ancient chief who was saved from drowning by riding to shore on the back of a whale. This is a classically constructed 21st-century fable of generational and gender conflict in which the old ways compete with progressive ideas and an individual female voice attempts to be heard in a patriarchal society. As the heroine, Pai, Keisha Castle-Hughes is a real find - possessed of a glorious screen face, with her dark unruly hair framing strong features and piercing eyes locked in concentration or scowling at the weight of her destiny. In a film of many delights, her mesmerising performance carries the conviction not just of a natural born leader but of a natural born star.
B00006879E|5.0|I so enjoy this CD!!! I ahve jsut ebcome a fan but I LOVE WHAT I hear so far!! It's really just mellow songs but I love it!! If your into John mayer I say buy this CD!!
B00006LI4S|5.0|Not much to say other than I truly enjoyed this concert. The musicians Gilmour has assemled together are top notch, as well as the singing and guitar playing by Gilmour himself. His immense talent and contribution to Floyd's success is very evident in this concert. And contrary to some of the other reviews, I thought the guest singers on Comfortably Numb were great, preferring the first of the two versions. And I LOVED the Cello!<br />Get this video!!!
B0000C7PSW|3.0|I had very high hopes for this album because I enjoyed his first two albums so much (&quot;Poses&quot; is excellent); I was disappointed however.<BR>If you've heard his previous two albums, I can compare this one to a couple of songs: &quot;Foolish Love&quot; on his debut album, and &quot;The Consort&quot; on Poses. The songs are blandly uniform.<BR>Tracks 1,4,8 and 11 are worthy of a return listen, but the rest are simply rehashed ideas that detract, rather than add to, the orginal.<BR>If you like the slow Rufus, then you'll like this one very much. Good music to fall asleep to, I guess.
0440412617|3.0|I read this in the hardback edition when I was a teenager.  I loved it so much that when I saw immediately bought it when I saw it on sale as a paperback.  What a disappointment!  The last chapter was altered so the ending was different.  I even got out the original hardcover from the library to check that I wasn't remembering incorrectly - but sadly it was true.<br />While the new version is very good, it just isn't the same as the original.
B00009V7T2|5.0|If I had to describe this album I'd say it sounds like Rush meets fusion meets the year 2020. Cool stuff!
B000003TA4|1.0|HAVE YOU EVER TRIED TO UNDERSTAND ANY SONG COMPOSED BY KURT COBAIN? THEYRE SO CRAZY AND STUPID AT THE SAME TIME! VO TOMAR NO MEIO DO CU TODO MUNDO QUE GOSTA DE NEVERMIND E OUTRAS MSICAS GRITADAS, QUE SO UMA BOSTA! GO ON AND GET &quot;REVOLVER&quot; INSTEAD!
B0000BWVCM|3.0|I am a devoted Christian, but rthis movie supported evolution, hich I didnt like.  The comics had nothing to do with evolution, y screw up a good thing.  The action wasnt half bad, it was only about a third bad.
B000002KIK|1.0|BLACK SABBATH IS ONE OF THE WORST BANDS EVER! DONT BUY ANY ALBUM FROM THEM AT ALL! THEY ARE SO STUPID AND BORING! ITS JUST A LOUD NOISE WITH STUPID LYRICS. BUT I THINK NIRVANA MAY BE EVEN WORSE. DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR:GO ON AND BUY EXILE ON MAIN STREET FROM THE ROLLING STONES, A REAL GREAT ALBUM.
B00008PC2O|5.0|T2 is better than the first.  It's funnier, a touching story, grat speical effects, ad it's all finely packaged in this duel layer dvd with an awesome case.
B0000B1OFL|4.0|An above average film with some pretty cool characters (Seth Green and Mos Def are the two best characters in the film) and some above average scenes.<br />However, the highlight of the film is the cover of the DVD and the methods the director of photography tries to mask the fact that Marky Mark Wahlberg is about half a foot shorter than Charlize Theron! Every trick in the book is used (down shots, both characters sitting down, fast cuts).<br />The cover is just hilarious, for it to be real Marky Mark would have to be about six foot three inches tall. <br />A solid way to spend a couple of hours on a slow night.
6305252521|4.0|This is about a man named Truman who lives his wholw life as a TV show.  He deosn't know it.  24/7 is on air, and iunaware (as the box puts it).  <BR>This movie was pretty touching, and creative, pl;us, it really makes u think about how privielgded u r with privacy.<BR>But I think it was a bit too serious, and could have and should have been one of those movies that doesnt take itself seriously.<BR>But overall it's a great movie.
6303823351|3.0|&gt;I would not be surprised if HELP! was the first movie to feature the format that is nowadays referred to as music videos.<br />Considering that &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; came *before* &quot;Help!&quot;, *I* would be very surprised.<br />There are a few good bits here, but this doesn't hold a candle to &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot;. &quot;Help!&quot; is why the Beatles stopped making movies. (McCartney's disastrous &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; was a television show. &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; was a King Features spin-off of their Beatles Saturday-morning cartoon show, which the Beatles themselves resisted having anything to do with fiercely--see George Martin's &quot;All You Need is Ears&quot;.) Three stars is charitable.
B00005N5S5|4.0|The Terminator is considered one of the greatest action movies of all time...and not just by me...well, by me too but......  anyway it's a really greast movie and should be watched again and again.
B000099T2L|5.0|I Really think that Beyonce' Knowles is one of the most talented female artists in R&amp;B music. She mix a incredible vocal power with a great talent how producer and composer, and she done this lovely and catchy album with all your soul. Any people can don't like it because much people dont have a oped mind for new and original r&amp;b songs because this album is a very original and diferent r&amp;b album, with influences of the years 80 and much more. The musics are magic and had a own personality. This is a Great Album of a Great Singer: Beyonce!!!
B00005JM0B|4.0|Teminator 3: Rise of the Machines is to the most climatic point that u could get in the TerminaTOR seris.  The thing that I didnt like about it was that the morals completly changed.  The moral of t1 was: &quot;U can choose ur destiny.&quot;  And in t2 they kept repeating &quot;No fate, but what we make for ourselves.&quot;  But now they tryed to bring out &quot;U can't escape ur destiny.&quot;  Personally, I donm't beilve in fate, but I beilve that everything happens for a reason.., Anyway,, I dont wanna find enlightenment, all I'm saying is that they need to stick with a common moral..  <BR>     But It really was quite entertainig.  <BR>Lots of ction and plot galore.
B0000TB014|5.0|...but this is not Michael's best DVD.  There are no behind the scenes, making of the video extras, and many of the videos have bee overly edited.  <br />Noticibly absent is the controversial &quot;panther&quot; part at the end of &quot;Black or white&quot; when Michael breaks car windows, grabs his croch (ALOT) and turns into a black panther.  THIS IS THE BEST PART OF THE VIDEO!  It showcases some of Michael's best footwork and dance moves.  (you can see it on &quot;Dangerous: The Short Films&quot; and &quot;HIStory on Film, Volume I.&quot;<br />Fortunately &quot;Thriller&quot; is the full version (how can you cut the greatest short film of all time?-- YOU CAN'T!)<br />&quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; video sucks!  That's right it SUCKS!  It's not the amazing dance sequence seen in &quot;Moonwalker&quot; where Michael dances, in my opioion, his best EVER in a short film.  But it is a slow motion, weird, cut-up, sequence of shots from the entire 40 minute &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; video seen in &quot;Moonwalker.&quot;  Trust me, I am Michael Jackson's biggest fan, and its no good.<br />Also, I wish they would have put the &quot;Moonwalker&quot; version of &quot;Man in the Mirror.&quot;  Instead they have the mainstream one, a collection of inspirational real-life footage; its good, but I like to see Michael perform with all the passion he does in the &quot;Moonwalker&quot; version.<br />The only videos I'd say are missing are &quot;Jam,&quot; &quot;They Don't Care About Us&quot; and &quot;Remember the Time.&quot;  But all the other MAJOR videos are in there.  (You can see these on Michael's other DVD's.)<br />I am so happy, they put &quot;Dirty Diana&quot; and &quot;Rock My World&quot; in this DVD, as you can't see them on any other Michael Jackson DVD.  And they are SPECTACULAR videos.  &quot;Rock my world&quot; features Chris Tucker and Marlon Brando and Michael does some realy cool dance moves.  &quot;Dirty Diana&quot; is a powerful video replicating a live performance.  Personally, I had only been able to see these videos a couple of times, when they came on MTV and VH1.  Now I can watch again and again.  <br />You will definitly LOVE this DVD as it has all (or most of) the Number One hit Videos.<br />I think &quot;Dangerous the Short Films&quot; and &quot;HIStory Continues: Past Present Future, Volume II&quot; are better collections of Michael's short films.  <br />Michael Jackson is still the King of Pop, and so it gets 5 stars.
B00005JKHN|1.0|Thios movie is not a good adult movie.  Trust me, it's for 4 year old GIRLS.  4 year old guys wuld say it's icky-poo-picky.  And then get beat up by the 3-year-old.
B0000CDLA7|2.0|For DT : Please, please, please. Make a clear line between Metal and Prog Rock. I'm sure you can mix between it.<BR>I have a suggestion, maybe you should working together with Spock's Beard (Although, I know you already work together !!).
B00009TB5G|4.0|This was an awesome mopvie.  It's sooo long, but at least I'm getting my moneys worth.  The 2 Towers was an awesome movie and a must have.<BR>     The only thing I didnt like was that how it was too long ago.  lol.
B00005JMCN|5.0|For those whose gray matter has not yet absorbed this vitally important fact - Seabiscuit is a true story.  The characters and horse are real and actually, in the book, there is alot more that happens than the movie shows.  Seabiscuit did have a stall mate named Pumpkin and dogs too.  This is simply a big, beautiful, well-acted, feel-good film that makes you feel a range of emotions.   Imagine living during the depression and getting inspiration and hope from a beaten-down horse who everyone pegged as a loser and the three men whose lives were changed forever because of him.  If you're the type who sees the dark cloud behind every silver lining, you won't like it.  For those who are not afraid to laugh, cry and cheer, you'll love it.  This film was a labor of love and it shows.  Treat yourself and your senses.
B00000AOUD|5.0|Just great, this is my favorite  Jethro Tull album, for a few reasons:    1. Have you ever heard of an album that has just one song, that takes up all the time on the record. Unfortunatley, when it's done live now, they play only 9 minutes of it. This concept of having one song, was later varied with Yes's &#34;Tales from Topographic Oceans&#34;(cool name), which is a double album, made up of four songs, each covering the four sides, making them all about twenty minutes long. Unfortunatley that album, isn't as good as this. At the time of this album, Yes was on fragile, George Harrison was in Bengaladewsh, The Rolling Stones were on Main Street, as it mentions, in the acompanying booklet to this cd, which has a bit of new material.    2.There's not a single dull moment on this record, but there are a few brief pauses at the begining of the second side.    3. Skip newsday for today, and read the booklet, with alot of nice things in there, such as the Adventures of Fluffy Duck.    4. The interviews are pretty good, but the live version is nothing special. There isn't much material from the second side in the live part, but the first side is slightly better anyway. Anderson, never says Brick at the very end of the live section.    5. Yes, it can be humorus, in fact,Anderson mentions Monty Python's Flying Circus, by then working on the third season and on Previous Record .    Well that's it for now. Wouldn't it be wonderful if it was even longer? Well, now I'm bored so I'll read the paper......&#60;wink,wink&#62;
B00003CXMG|5.0|&quot;Almost Famous&quot; is one of the best films that I've seen in a long time.  Cameron Crowe masterfully comes up with a semi-autobiographical story about a boy named William, who gets the ultimate chance of a lifetime: go on tour with a rising rock band, and write about it for Rolling Stone Magazine.  On his adventure with the band (Stillwater), he meets people that change his life completely and help him come of age.  The movie is funny and moving at the same time, and if you're a music freak, than I think that helps make the experience even better.  Besides having a perfect cast, the soundtrack is also great, featuring songs by Elton John, The Who, Led Zeppelin, and many others.  Buy it, it's awesome.
B00005U16N|5.0|Rarely has one actor put on display such talent and nuance.<br />Simply put, along with a handful of todays actors, Mr Depp shines brightest. Since there are so many reviews of &quot; Blow&quot; it is really senseless to add any more anecdotes, overviews or anything else but to say..Johnny Depp gives me a reason for going out to a movie..something I rarely do .<br />Depp has it all... deliverey, Facial expressions, charisma , nuance and everything else that makes a great actor.I am just waiting for another film with Depp in it because I will have to travel to the theater and see it !! <br />Bravo!
B0000DD7LC|5.0|When I first saw Alicia Keys on Jay Leno back in 2001, I was blown away. I knew she was the real thing. It's rare that an artist of this magnitude comes along. Alicia captures the meaning of soul.<br />The Diary of Alicia Keys is a welcome upgrade to SIAM. I didn't know what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised. It's pure talent. No one does R&amp;B better than Alicia. She truly understands the roots of the genre and incorporates that into her music.<br />Alicia doesn't try to be anyone else but herself, and that's an endangered species in today's landscape.  She's brave enough to do something different and take the heat for it. Years from now when they're talking about R&amp;B gems, The Diary of Alicia Keys will not be forgotten.<br />I buy music from all different genres, and I can honestly say that this is an impressive CD. This is a mature set coming from someone so young. I love R&amp;B and anyone else who really does should grab The Diary of Alicia Keys and add it to their collection immediately.
B00006J3FK|4.0|The DVD version of this film is superb. David Mamet, one of the few terrific playwrights we have now  makes it all come true.<br />This is one of Baldwin's best performances( he is on screen just enough) Jack Lemmon leads a stellar cast along with Ed Harris, Alan Arkin and a very greasy Al Pacino.<br />THe extra features on this DVD are basically tributes to a film great Jack Lemmon. Not only was he in the elite as an actor  he was a true gent himself.  I recall reading the life story about Dimitri Tiomkin and one of his first film scores( composition) <BR>Max Steiner was conducting and Tiomkin was taken aback a bit by what he saw. He saw Steiner, working very hard trying to get the most out of Tiomkins score.<br />It was then Tiomkin knew that the greats had little ego and the only thing that mattered was the finished product. Well for Mr. Lemmon that is WHAT MATTERED. ..and that is the resonance of a true artist. Lemmon's Shelly Levine is on target and Lemmon fights to minimize any pathos around him in this sales den of evil. A unique film experience !!<br />CP
B00005JM02|4.0|Pixar has a flawless track record in terms of putting out quality stories for any age. Their stories contain a perfect blend of tragedy and comedy, adventure and drama. Every character in Finding Nemo has a want, a need, and a past. There isn't a character in the movie that seems like a puppet for a plot. My favorite character of the film is Dory voiced by Ellen DeGeneres. Where in so many other films the sidekick is used just for an occasional laugh, Dory has perhaps the most emotional and heartbreaking scene of the film. <br />The animation is amazing. With each film Pixar sets the bar higher. <br />Is this movie perfect? No, in fact it's not even my favorite Pixar movie (which is Monster's Inc.). In selected scenes it gets a little too overdramatic, but this is just nitpicking. Finding Nemo is definately one of the three best movies of the year.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|From the first song to the last, this is the best Britney album to date.  The best songs on the album include &quot;I Got That (Boom Boom),&quot; &quot;Breathe On Me,&quot; and &quot;Toxic.&quot;  The people who gave this album a bad rating are either jealous girls or punk poseur boys.  Do youself a favor and go out and get this album!
B0000AXE8I|2.0|The Washowski Brothers did so much right in the Matrix that it was impossible to match it. The build up and the expectations could never have been met, much like the prequels to the Star War triology.  <br />I thought some of the key action sequences, in terms of spectacle and action were outstanding. Where the scenes fall flat as does most of the movie is in the drama and emotion. What lifted the first film from being just a standard action movie were the themes of truth and love. The filmmakers in the second installment barried the story with philosophy and removed anything human or emotional from it. Even the relationship between neo and Trinity seems forced and trite. Above all I did not get a feeling of urgency or danger. With all the spectaclar stunts and action happening I never felt that the main characters were in danger. <br />I know most of the Matrix fans out there hate me by now, but trust me when I say I wanted to love this film so much. I can understand how action fans out there love this movie, but I wanted more to it. Where the first film had focus, a clear goal, and an underlying message, the sequel was devoid of all three of those traits. <br />After the movie ended my wife leaned over to me and said, 'I didn't understand what happened'. I told her what I thought happened but as I spoke to friends that had seen the film, almost everyone one of them had a different answer.
B00000I8NC|5.0|I own 2 of the four major releases by godspeed you! black emperor and i have to say this is my favorite. Although being only a half-hour in length, it shows great strength and great execution (especially on BBF3.) The build up sets the mood of the climax and is a picture of what is to come. The climax is my favorite part, first with the sweet drums and then going to the violin-swipes. You can almost imagine what is happening.
0792164903|4.0|One of my favorite horror movies, and I strongly reccomend purchasing it.<br />Ichabod (Johnny Depp) is a New York City detective whose unorthodox techniques and penchant for gadgets make him unpopular with is colleagues. He is sent to the remote town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of bizarre murders, in which a number of people have been found dead in the woods, with their heads cut off. Local legend has it that a Hessian ghost rides through the woods on horseback, lopping off the heads of the unsuspecting and unbelieving. Ichabod refuses to believe in this legend, convinced that there must be a logical explanation for the murders. In time, Ichabod becomes smitten with a local lass, Katrina Van Tassel (Christina Ricci), who is the sweetheart of the burly Brom Bones (Casper Van Dien), and he becomes determined to capture the murderer to prove his bravery and win her heart. Christopher Walken, Jeffrey Jones, and Christopher Lee highlight the supporting cast; Lee's appearance is particularly apt, since Burton has cited the Hammer films of the 1960s as a major influence in making this film. Andrew Kevin Walker and Tom Stoppard contributed to the screenplay.
B0000634EV|5.0|All I can do is envy this band when I listen to them, it must have been a blast to make.  It's a heavy southern rock/metal album with a little something for everyone.  Songs such as &quot;Ghosts along the Mississippi&quot; and &quot;Dog tired in the fast lane&quot; are metal and quite addictive.  Then you have tracks like &quot;Where im going&quot; and &quot;Learn from my mistakes&quot; that prove the range of these musicians from thrash guitar to slide and resonator.  It's a definite must buy for all fans of good music. I HIGHLY recomend this album
0375758992|5.0|This is a wonderful book that deserves to be put on HS &amp; JHS reading lists.  Wonderfully realistic &amp; believable coming of age volume, which only incidentally takes place in declining-white southern Africa.
B00008PW2E|5.0|An amazing feat in television viewing.  A story line that twists and tempts, but keeps you begging for more.  Sometimes the gay characters stimulate your thinking, and sometimes the straight characters stimulate you in other ways.  I found myself staying up way too late to catch the next curve, only to find myself excited about the next disc.  A must have for your DVD library
B00005JMJ4|5.0|... and that is how I was after watching Sofia Coppola's homage to finding friends and the oddness that is Japan. After laughing at the \\"lip\\" scene and many others... I ended up in tears when I least expected it.<br />This is a movie I think everyone should see... not only is it funny, it is very poignant.
B000099T2L|1.0|I don't own the cd but have listened to the radio in the car of my friend who likes this stuff. I hate pop/r&amp;b, so I don't like this. The lyrics are way too mushy for me. My dad bought it. He never listens to it, though. <br />I don't understand how people like bey-whatever and other &quot;artists&quot; like her. The music is so fake, and she doesn't have any REAL talent, she just pretends to. <br />Please, if you're really reading this, DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!
B000002I2M|5.0|L.A. Woman would be the last album the Doors would record with Jim Morrison before he died in July 1971. When this was recorded, Morrison was in poor health, his voice ravaged from years of excess. The band was rarely playing live, banned from many venues due to Morrison's controversial stage antics. Musical tastes were also changing around this time as singer-songwriters like Carole King and James Taylor and the mellow pop of the Carpenters were dominating the charts.<br />So what did the Doors do? Well for starters, they went back to basics. The timeless genre known as the blues. Jim may have not been able to belt out a tune like &quot;Light My Fire&quot; at this point, but his lower grittier register was perfect for the blues tracks &quot;Been Down So Long&quot;, &quot;Cars Hiss By My Window&quot;, and &quot;Crawling King Snake.&quot; Many of the other tracks such as &quot;Hyacinth House&quot;, &quot;L'America&quot;, and &quot;The Wasp (Texas Radio and the Big Beat)&quot; continue the somber mood of the album. However, it's the three classic rock standards, the jazzy &quot;Riders On The Storm&quot;, the upbeat &quot;Love Her Madly&quot;, and the driving title track that are the strongest tracks here. As on their previous albums, Ray Manzarek, John Densmore, and Robby Krieger add the perfect accompaniment to each track whether it's the memorable piano line on &quot;Riders On The Storm&quot;, the march drum beat on &quot;L'America&quot;, or the gritty guitar solos on the blues tracks.  Along with Morrison Hotel and their self-titled debut album, L.A. Woman is among their best work. Highly recommended to all classic rock and blues rock fans.
0679428895|3.0|For a writer of Harris's caliber, this was a disappointment.  I've enjoyed his other books, but felt this one was filled with so much additional detail about the era itself that he lost the storyline.
0676973779|4.0|I liked the fact that the author looked at all religions rather than focusing just on one (F.Y.I. I'm not a relgious person). The main character was well developed and the story was interesting.
B00005JLTM|2.0|The Matrix Reloaded was 138 minutes of pure senseless, noisy cat and mouse chases. The fight scenes and the freeway car chase was too long. The slow methodical way the characters talked was boring and nerve wrecking. What was the point of everybody wearing sunglasses? The movie's action scenes were just too fantastic to believe i.e  flying through the air on motorcycles, fighting over a 100 men at a time etc... Maybe I am just not a sci-fi fan. The only good thing about the movie to me was looking at Keanu Reeves.

0156027321|5.0|Yann Martel has, as far as I'm concerned, written a fine story in Life of Pi. So much of it rings true: the way it is presented (an author stumbles on a story while in India), the details, the conversations, the factual zoological elements, the humanness of the characters.<br /><br />I was intrigued by the life of the teenaged Pi Patel in India and his fascination with religion. While no particularly deep or new theological epiphanies came out of it for the reader, from the view of a boy of sixteen or less, it seemed quite normal. My aunt spent 35 years as a missionary in India, and the story's background rings true, from what she told me about the land.<br /><br />The family life was interesting, and all members were well-developed human beings so that there was nothing to detract from the reader's gullibility (or should we say,&quot;acceptance?&quot;): this might be non-fiction--a REAL story of a REAL human-being.<br /><br />It is my belief that humans are naturally gullible creatures: if someone races into a cafe and shouts, &quot;There's been a terrible accident down the street!&quot; everyone believes them with no other evidence than their word , and wants to know more. Only incongruous details destroy our gullibility. And we test our gullibility regularly through our troubadors--our storytellers--laughing with relief only when we see through their deception. We are mental creatures, and like other carnivores sharpening their claws and establishing their territorial claims on trees, we sharpen our skills by relating to stories.<br /><br />I was enthralled with the adventure on the high seas--all very believable. Ships DO vanish. I've been there, and the ocean is indeed vast and has many moods, all of which seem to be captured here. The plight with the zoo animals aboard the lifeboat seemed to me to be perfectly plausible and well-described. The animal reactions between Richard Parker and Pi Patel even seemed extremely plausible. In short, Yann Martel had me in the palm of his hand. The universe loves a story, and a storyteller is God's gift.<br /><br />The implausiblility that finally led me to the inescapable conclusion that this was fiction, and not non-fiction posing as fiction, was the carnivorous floating island! Such a phenomenon would certainly have been discovered--probably centuries ago-- and would by now be overrun by zoologists, anthropologists, botanists, and others. It would be better known than the Seychelles. But it was this very implausibility that demonstrated the author's imagination, and proved beyond doubt his rank as a troubador.<br /><br />Without the island sequence, the book might well have been accepted widely as non-fiction--simply an extraordinary tale recounted to the author as it was described in the beginning, which would have been a sad thing. A great talent would have been short-changed.<br /><br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre<br /><br />author of Handguns and Freedom--their care and maintenance<br />and other bookshad me in the palm of his hand.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|Divas Beware!  This is a musical for women, about women and entertaining for everyone.  The two leads Menzel and Chenoweth, each deserve Tony Awards for their portrayals of Glinda and Elphaba.  The music starts off as intense as one would expect for the title, but quickly ventures into many styles.  Perhaps one of the most memorable moments is &quot;Popular.&quot;  However, intensity returns to the musical scores as the two roommates explore their own identities in lavish songs such as &quot;Defying Gravity&quot;, &quot;I'm Not That Girl&quot;, &quot;No Good Deed&quot; and &quot;For Good.&quot;  This is a real tour de force from the man who has shown us so many sides to his compositional talents. From &quot;Godspell&quot; to  Disney soundtracks, to &quot;Wicked&quot; Stephen Schwartz has given American music many wonderful gems.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|As a die-hard fan from the beginning, I cannot give this film any less than 5 stars. The epic saga's ending is actually the perfect one if you think about it, and I can totally see how many people started to think of it as a sort of holy object such as the Bible or Quaran. I must admit, at one point, I even started to catch myself thinking the same thing. The philosophical concepts addressed are, in my opinion, the stuff that we are made of. We often find ourselves wondering about such questions that have no answer, and although this final installment doesn't even try to answer its own questions once and for all, it provides the viewer with the beginnings so that he/she may find an answer satisfying to themselves. I liked the concept of the Indian family very much, and the new Oracle does her best to fill our beloved Gloria Foster's shoes. I liked the acting, though a bit cheesy at times, of Carrie-Ann Moss, and for all those Keanu condemners, I agree with the fact that he doesn't show much emotion in this film. However, I strongly think that this is a character trait of Neo, who knows he has to go on and finish things once and for all so that he can finally be with his beloved. All in all, a flourishing finish to an unforgettable epic that will have me thinking for years to come.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|This is the first cd I actually purchased of Alicia Keys. I have played it since purchasing it two days ago 10 times.<BR>Now I am really a fan. For  a long while I was upset by the professional demise of Whitney but Alicia has given me hope and  renewed my interest in R and B again. She will only keep getting better and better like fine wine. You go girl and thanks for including the DVD-what a nice gift to your fans. You are truly an Aquarian.<BR>If you gave Alicia a bad review I think you may be intimidated by any one of the following. These days we admire artists who can play an instrument and sing beautifully at the same time. So Keys does both of these beautifully and in addition she writes her own music. Let's face it - she is the BOMB! and much more.
0553345834|1.0|This is a story book!  I usually give books the benefit of the doubt but this book flat out sux.  All this guy talks about is how he is some hot shot sports agent and the lessons he supposedly learned through the years.  Let me tell you something, this book got old after the 2nd chapter.  Every F'in paragraph has to do with one of his golf clients and bla bla bla.  Its ridiculous.  The title is true, they dont teach this at Harvard because they're stories of an individuals life which completely put me to sleep.  But im not going to leave without giving some positives, like saying you should check out Automatic millionaire and the 12 critical factors books.  Those are worth reading.  Peace in the middle east!
B00005JMEW|5.0|First off, let me state that while I have enjoyed all of his movies, I have not, until now considered myelf a \\"Quentin Taratino fan.\\"  Second, I must elaborate on what one other reviewer wrote; the ladies of KILL BILL's Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (aka. DiVAS) would eat Charlie's Angels for breakfast with a side of wheat toast and a glass of orange juice.  If you want an action movie with REAL women, see KILL BILL.  The ladies of Quentin Tarantino's latest picture are beautiful without ridiculously tight or revealing costumes.  They are sexy without laughable, double ententre dialogue.  These women smart, strong, and dangerous.<BR>   At it's heart KILL BILL is a simple revenge-action picture (albeit a excellent one).  However, the film centers around the best-written female characters that Hollywood has seen in the last 25 years.  And not one or two, but many.<BR>   KILL BILL is a glorious synthesis of the Spaghetti Western, the Hong Kong Action Flick, Japanese Anime, the Samurai films of Kurosawa, the Mob Movie, and even a touch of the Errol Flynn Swashbuckler, from across the entire history of cinema.  It is not a complex, emotional film, but a relentlessly enjoyable homage to every \\"popcorn movie\\" made before it.  Plus Tarantino manages to add an unprecendented layer to these genres: women.  Go see KILL BILL.  You won't be sorry.
B000002HJD|5.0|Rob O'Connor, whoever you are, you're a jerk! So, according to YOU, the music of the Doors is &quot;at least as good as Tommy James and the Shondells?&quot; Flashes in the pan like Tommy James are NOT EVEN in the same league as The Doors, and music history attests to this. The Doors' influence on every generation since far outweighs almost forgettable acts like Tommy James--the only notable thing he ever did was &quot;Crimson and Clover&quot;, and that's not even as innovative as the Doors at their worst. Why do you post your reviews at the beginning of the artist's catalogue, as if they are fact, as if they speak for the majority------Screw you man!! Remove this man's posts from this catalogue!
B0000C9V3T|5.0|LOVED the movie, haven't grabbed this cd yet.(though I did love the music used in this film!)  BUT, I wanted to mantion that Oren Ishii is not described as HALF Japanese, HALF Chinese, and HALF American; she is HALF Japanese, and HALF Chinese-American -- as in, she had one parent who was of Chinese descent but was from America.  Just pay attention, it's all there.
B000002OX7|5.0|Anyone who doesn't respect this album is not true fan of music.  Period.  It is actually a bit softer than the big hits such as Baba O'Reilly and Won't Get Fooled Again indicate, but that's quite all right because the songwriting and execution are both flawless.  There are no failed experiments, filler tracks, pretentious political ideals, trivial lyrics, or clunky attempts at fusion.  At the same time, Who's Next is extremely deep and moving.  Exhileration, anger, humor, freedom, pain, disillusionment, catharsis, and even inner peace (see \\"Going Mobile or \\"Getting in Tune\\") are expressed with an immediacy and passion that I haven't seen in many other quarters.  And all the while, it is FUN and exuberant.  Townshend isn't purporting to give the listener the meaning of life, but he does explore much of the human experience.  Who hasn't felt the alienation of \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\", the fanatical infatuation of \\"Bargain,\\" or the giddy joy of travel portrayed in \\"Going Mobile?\\"  Musically, Moon's drums are insistent and give the songs a zealous electricity, Entwistle's bass is perfectly constructed, the vocals are outstanding, and Pete's rhythm guitar is tight.  And of course, there is THE definitive rock scream at the end of \\"Won't Get Fooled Again.\\"  The only problem I have is the inclusion of the bonus tracks, which I feel cheapen the experience even though some of them are worthwhile (especially that scorching Marvin Gaye cover).
B00008J4P5|5.0|...this album is absolutely smashing.  After hearing nothing but praise for it for months, I finally gave in and bought it.  It knocked my socks off.  Standout songs include There's No Home For You Here, The Hardest Button to Button, and The Air Near My Fingers.  But my clear favorite is the heartbreaking I Want to Be The Boy To Warm Your Mother's Heart.  It is an outpouring of frustration and resentment, mixed with equal parts sweetness and hope.  It is an almost unnervingly beautiful song.  I recommend this album to anyone, as there are so many different styles and sounds in it that everyone is likely to find something they love.  Believe the hype, and buy a copy of this album.
B000056K04|3.0|I consider myself a pretty avid Dave fan. I have every album, have been to a few shows, and it occupies most of my CD player's time. Although many fans like me do not like this album, I still think that it's worth getting. Yes, it's true that the CD is filled with some really bland, poppy tracks such as &quot;The Space Between&quot;, and &quot;Angel&quot;, but there are some tracks that justify the album. &quot;So Right&quot; is high quality, on-par with some of his Before These Crowded Streets and Busted Stuff songs. &quot;When the World Ends&quot; is a great song to relax to, and &quot;What You Are&quot; has a great urgent riff that gets you into the song. Even &quot;I Did It&quot;, though disgustingly poppy, is catchy. <br />All in all, I think that it is both worthy of adding to your collection of Dave CDs, or a great first one to buy if you are just getting into the band and looking for some of his most accessible music. If you are a &quot;purist&quot; Dave fan, however, don't expect to be impressed.
B000002UY3|5.0|My best friend Tony and I piled ourselves and our surfing gear into his old Fiat to begin the hour-long drive to the beach for a day of surfing He says, \\"here,I'll take care of the music\\", and puts in a cassette of someone called Mazzy Star.  I'm not one of those people who makes snap judgements about music, for better or for worse.  Whatever the end result may be, There are a few exceptions, and She Hangs Brightly ended up to be just such an exception.  No more than 90 seconds into Halah, the opening track, I found myself saying to Tony, \\"Who is this??  I REALLY like this....whoever it is.\\"  <br /> So that was the first day I ever heard the completely unique sounds of Mazzy Star, and I can still recall the exact moment well over 10 years later.<br />I went on to spend the entire decade of the '90s calling Mazzy Star one of my favorite bands whenever the topic came up in conversation.   Even though I give this one five stars, I actually prefer the other two a bit more I think, particularly So Tonight That I Might See, their second release.  There's just something about that album.  It's like their sound overall...I can't really put my finger on it.  Maybe that's the whole point.  Yes, Hope Sandoval's blissfully enchanting voice has alot to do with it.  And as much as she no doubt hates hearing it, it was easy to fall in love with her vicariously through her dreamy vocals.  But a sexy frontwoman alone does not a great band make.  The musicianship of the rest of the band is equal in its ability to enchant the listener.  In other words, Mazzy Star was always more than just a pretty face.  The band had an elusive quality about them, an element of mystery.  You can get lost in their music.  If you were a drug user, you no doubt spent many memorable moments letting the swirling sounds overtake you and your senses (and I suppose an equal number that aren't so memorable).  While I've done my share of experimentation, I always found Mazzy's music plenty powerful to put me into that special state of mind even when stone cold sober.  One just needs to be in an introspective mood (and a good pair of headphones doesn't hurt).  This isn't the sort of album you put into your Walkman when heading out for a jog though, clearly.  <br />Recalling my first exposure to this wonderful band - seemingly now defunct - is a pleasant memory.  If you've read other reviews of their albums, you should by now have an idea whether or not Mazzy Star is up your alley.  If you have even the vaguest feeling that it is, don't hesitate to give them a try right away.
B000002JSN|5.0|I must start by saying that im a HUGE zeppelin fan. Jimmy page is also the reason im playing guitar. And I must also say that this is probably there best album ever (if you can even say that one is better than the other). So if your a big zeppelin fan and dont own this GET IT cause its stunning and if your not speach less after listening to it their something wrong with you. And if your just a stupid pozer, than beware cause its to much for you retards. Thanks for reading.
0553260111|1.0|I will concede that the book did have a lot of action and plot twists.  Without giving away too much of the plot, here's the general idea.  The heroine receives some trauma to the head which results in amnesia.  The only clue to his identity is a secret bank account number found on his person.  Upon trying to track down his identity, the protagonist discovers he has secret-agent-type skills and a seemingly endless number of bad guys are trying to kill him.<br />The plot did seem to be well thought out and I'd say it is not at all predictable, but one repetitive theme ruined the book for me; it seemed as though the main character is getting shot or blown up in every chapter of the book.  That in itself isn't necessarily bad, but he gets riddled with bullets and manages to keep going, and this happens repeatedly.  It reminds me of those thriller/horror movies where you think the villain is dead, but he keeps coming back to life for that last attempt to kill the teenagers.<br />At first, this didn't bother me, and I was enjoying the book;  however, I can only take so much unbelievable garbage.  As I reached the half-way point I found I had to force myself to continue reading, and after a few sessions after that, I gave up on the book; I couldn't stand it anymore.<br />If you can overlook this major annoyance, then you probably would like this book, but if you're like me and need certain aspects of the action to have a fragment of realism, then you might want to look for something else to read.

B0000TG9E2|5.0|I'm sure everyone has seen the film but what really sets this collection off is the second disc of extras.  Many DVD's have hours of extras that are comprehensive but not very interesting.  The extras on Alice are must sees, as far as quality goes, the best ever.  Walt Disney's film was being promoted at the same time Walt began exploring television, in fact Disney's very first TV show, a 1950 Christmas Day special featuring Kathryn Beaumont (Alice), Walt Disney and Edgar Bergan and Charlie McCarthy is presented here in its entire 60 minute length (including vintage Coca-Cola commericals written into the show).  Also presented is the entire 30 minutes of the Fred Waring show which debuted some of the music in live staged acts also starring Beaumont and Chesire Cat Sterling Holloway (the DVD says just excerpts but all they cut were the commercials!)  There is also a 15-minute television special featuring Walt riding his minature railroad through the studio soundstages as we see behind the scenes footage.  Kathryn Beaumont appears in most of the extra footages and we see how much of it was performed as if it were a stage play so that the artists could be inspired.  In fact, by the time you finish all the extras you would have thought you just watched the entire film in live-action.  There is also a recent short where Beaumont talks about the music from Alice and Peter Pan (also starring Beaumont) and how they were connected.  What really makes these extras pop is the restoration of film clips that appear in the older specials.  The Fred Waring Show appears to be grainy as expected from a 50+ year old show, but when it shifts to a segment with Walt Disney (obviously filmed at the Disney studios), it appears Disney went back to their original stock that was in good condition and replaced the older segment.  They also inserted restored color versions of film clips in their originally broadcast black-and-white TV specials (the Disney Channel showed these all in black-and-white so this was a real surprise when I saw them here in full clear color).  About two hours of extras, all of it very entertaining.
B00014K5TQ|5.0|I've seen this movie, and I have to say it was a little shocking. There's an obscene amount of drug use, and the fact little Richie Rich is doing half the drugs in the movie makes it even weirder.  But it is still a great movie.  I found it supremely entertaining from the very first frame of Seth Green talking like a flambouyant newscatser.<br />But despite how hilarious this movie is, it is not a feel good movie.  The ending will leave feeling empty and cold.  But after you look back at Marylin Manson being a German transvestite, it all works out.<br />The book, Disco Bloodbath by James St. James, is unlike anything you'll ever read.  And it plays a pretty important role in the movie too.  I suggest the book as well as the movie.
B00008NRLX|5.0|My introduction to the Jayhawks came as a complete surprise - Rainy Day Music was bought on impulse, at a used CD store nonetheless. It's easily some of the best $7 I have spent. Never would I have imagined I would pick up such a collection of peaceful, classy heartland rock. Like an affable neighbor who always has something good to say - it would be hard to find flaws in this album. It's heartfelt, peaceful, melodic, catchy...just darn good! Highly recommended to fans of Tom Petty, Neil Young, John Mellencamp, catchy guitar pop...okay everyone.  Don't &quot;save it for a rainy day&quot; - pick it up today, and get lost in the gentle, melodic &quot;tailspin&quot; that is the Jayhawks unique sound.
B0000X61XM|5.0|I dont quite understand why the price of this box set is over 100 dollars .. you could go buy this at your neighbourhood Zellers, Wallmart, any store that sells DVD's for anywhere from $84.99 to $89.99 before tax. so amazon please explain why you have your units so overpriced?????
B000083C49|5.0|First the DVD review: Like the other ST Films re-released in a special 2 disc set, this one is PACKED with extras! Thank you Paramount! DVD features an excellent commentary by Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner who share alot of insight into the making of this wonderful movie, original interviews from 1986 featuring Shatner, DeForest, and Nimoy, a trailer, some great featurettes on the making of the film and the spfx, storyboards & gallerys, a very poignant tribute to the late Gene Roddenberry (the creator of ST) and Mark Lenard (Sarek, Spocks father), and something not mentioned in the Amazon DVD features section called the \\"FuturesPast: A Look Back\\". This is a half hour documentary which features new interviews with some of the cast, crew, and producers! Very neat stuff! <br />I say this is the ST even your grandma can enjoy because it is very light and entertaining. I agree with Nimoy when he said it was time to \\"lighten up\\" the series a bit and have some fun with it. Star Trek The Motion Picture was very serious (not for ST Fans with weak minds or an acute case of ADD though), ST II was also serious as we dealt with a bad guy bent on revenge and the death of Spock, and ST III Kirk lost his son and the Enterprise was blown up. <br />I am a BIG believer in originality when it comes to movies. Unfortunately this movie is not original. It blatantly steals the story of ST The Motion Picture (Alien probe of unknown origin is threatening the Earth and has to be communicated with in order for it to go away) and it capitalizes on a very popular storyline back in 1986 and that storyline is Time Travel. You had to be there, but back in 1985 a little movie called Back to the Future came out and it was a monster hit. So in 1986 Hollywood, of course, came out with another Time Travel hit called Peggy Sue Got Married. So it is no surprise that ST IV was influenced with this premise. I hate to admit it, but it works great for ST IV! I usually look at un-originality in storylineswith skepticism and sarcasm so when I went to see this in the theatre I was expecting the worst. What I found was a very fast paced, funny (of all things) ST movie that is universally recognized as the \\"best\\" Trek film! <br />I personally would never classify this movie as the greatest Trek film ever made, to do so would clearly label me as a shallow person because of the stolen premise, but it ranks very high on my list! I love the fact that this movie has an underlying current of Eco-Awareness too. The humor in seeing the original cast in modern day San Francisco is funny as well. <br />I was fortunate to see this movie in the theatre back in 1986 with a sold out house! The experience was awesome! Sitting on your couch and watching this movie pales in comparison to seeing it in the theatre with 100 or so other fans! Each joke was 10 times funnier! <BR>Note to Paramount: Hey, Paramount, how would you like to start a trend? Why don't you dust off these original cast Star Trek Movies and re-release them in the theatres? I would definitely go see it! (You would have to charge a discounted rate though because nobody will pay $10-$11 to go see what they have on DVD!) I want my kids and newer fans to know the experience of seeing these movies on the big screen again! TRUST ME, Paramount, people would flock to go see these movies! Clearly the American consumer is not flocking to anything that Hollywood is putting out nowadays.<br />OK, yes, there are TONS of funny and quotable lines in this movie. Personally my favorite happens in the beginning of the movie when Spock first boards the Bird of Prey ship, wearing a big white robe, and apologizes to Kirk and says \\"I seem to have misplaced uniform\\". Yes, hearing Kirk and Spock curse later on is funny but that ironic line is just classic!<br />Remember, there are VERY FEW must own DVD's and this is one of them! Get it before it goes out of print!
B00000AFGM|5.0|This is definately the best manson cd musically.  Ive been listening to this cd pretty much everyday for at least 3 years and it never gets old.  Its a great cd for any type of mood that youre in too, its a nice balance of soft and hard songs.  The best songs are #1, #5, #6, #7, #13 (even better on last tour on earth [acoustic]),#15.  This cd is great get it.
B000069HK2|2.0|If I'd been in a coma for the last 6 years, I think that I<br />might've been moderately impressed with this album. An<br />honest debut effort from a fledgling band, it has ecclectic<br />moments of rage, pain, reflection, and melancholy, crafted<br />with noteworthy musicianship. I think, though, that they<br />would've made a better effort had they never heard Jimmy Eat<br />World, Finch, or the Deftones. I think the band name speaks<br />for the sound, which sounds like it was tailored directly<br />from their influences. It lacks the catchiness of a pop<br />album, but it's not artsy enough to be an indie-rock cd....
B00003CWTI|5.0|At the begining you may find the plot a little confuse, but after some minutes you will watch a video that is really amazing.The film has really a brilliant argument and it is the kind of story you hardly ever see on TV. The characters, the soundtrack, every little moment is incredible. There is a so nice scene when all the characters, living in the same neighbourhood sing sequences of the song performed by Aimee. It is very emotional. All the characters are essential to build the plot. Although the rain of frogs could be a little strange, it can happens as it says the genious young character from a program between adults and kids. You have to watch it to rate it yourself.

Haley and Annie meet at summer camp and find out they are siblings. They want to reunite their parents, but the dad is busy with a flirty lady Merridith. But, on a camping trip, the girls plan a ay to get Merridith away! Will the parents reunite. Okay, I think we all know the answer.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|When i first saw this preview i was expecting a romeo and juliet story with werewolves, or lycans as in the movie, and vampires. i wasn't that. i thought that the story was good, the werewolves were trying to gain the upperhand in a war with vampires, but why did they make both sides so weak? if the vampires don't have guns they will be torn to shreds in a matter of seconds. they can't do anything but jump off buildings. why wouldthe werewolves, who i was voting for, ever transform. they had a better chance of killing some one if they shot them with their glow in the dark bullets. there is one good scene where a pack of the wolves kill a group of vampires on the train. lots of blood. there were also some ridiculous scenes, even for the movie, where seline standing in the middle of a narrow hall and can some how kill ten werewolfs, taking cover, shoting bullets that are filled with some kind of sunlight thing out of machine guns. she then walks away with out a scratch. i don't care if you are vampiric our not, you would be a pile of ashes at the end of the scene. there is also just one thing i should clear up. in original werewolf legend, the werewolves could transform at anytime not just at the full moon. if you can get by the few ridiculous moments then you should be fine with this.
0316666343|5.0|It was a beautifully written book, that made you smile, and cry.  I actually did break down, and for a book to do this too me, you know it has to be pretty powerful.  I thought the perspective that the book was written by was amazing.  The author is brilliant, and creative.  I loved reading of Susie's sister Lindsay and her relationship with her boyfriend.  The way t he family turned out seemed so real.  The only part that I didn't like was the end, it just ended a different way I thought it would.  Anyone would like this book, young or old.  Sometimes, I just wanted to pull Susie out from Heaven so she could be back with her family.  Ahh..
B000002HK4|4.0|A Change Of Seasons(1995). Dream Theater's first EP, featuring a lengthy studio title track and several live cover songs.<br />Along with Queensryche, Dream Theater is certainly one of the best and most influential progressive metal bands to come out of the 80s. First there was the promising debut When Dream And Day Unite(1989), then following up in 1992 with the masterpiece album Images & Words, definitely one of the best rock albums of the 90s. 1994's Awake saw the band take a heavier, darker, and less commercial sound, but still delivering some of the best progressive metal there is. Since Dream Theater values their fans quite a bit, they decided to release the EP A Change Of Seasons, which bought time between albums. Joining vocalist James Labrie, guitarist John Petrucci, drummer Mike Portnoy, bassist John Myung, and replacing former keyboardist Kevin Moore is Derek Sherinian (worked with DT, Alice Cooper, and Planet X). Despite what most DT fans will tell you, Sherinian is actually a masterful, dynamic, and inventive keyboardist, though his best material can be found from his solo work in a band called \\"Planet X\\". How does this release fare? Let's look:<br />First of all, let's talk about the one and only reason to actually buy this disc: the spectacular title track. Originally, ACOS was a b-side from the I&W album, but for some reason DT decided to resurrect this track. Whatever the case may be, I'm glad we got this song some way or another. They reworked it a bit and created a stellar epic, clocking in at a whopping 23 minutes. As the liner notes indicate, the band rehired I&W producer David Prater to help give the song the melodic atmosphere it needed. Instrumentally for the most part, it has the feeling of I&W, but with the raw production of the upcoming album Falling Into Infinity(1996). The song parts are played elaborately, and as a whole, it seems to ignore the Awake album's heavy guitar sound. The lyrics of course are some of the best they've had to date. Labrie sings very passionately, much like what he sounded like on I&W. Petrucci's guitar playing is very dexteritous as usual, and Portnoy shows off some excellent drumming complimenting the song sections. My only gripe is that the drums themselves sound weak, (not Portnoy's playing, just the sound of the drums). It's that they just seem to lack punch. They should at least sound as strong as the drums from Awake, if not the machine-sound used in I&W. Myung does a good job as well, though I don't recall anything here of his that really stood out. Sherinian mostly just provides piano and backing keyboard textures, until around the 19 minute mark where he pulls off an ABSOLUTELY AMAZING keyboard solo, some of the best Sherinian stuff I've heard to date. Overall, I'd have to say that this is a very worthwhile title track and worth the price of the disc alone. Maybe not the best thing DT has done like other reviewers have stated, but a solid track nonetheless.<br />As for the rest of the EP, it consists of nothing but live covers from various bands which influenced DT. Only the most die-hard DT fans who love all the bands being covered will appreciate these songs. There's 'Funeral For A Friend' & 'Love Lies Bleeding' by Elton John, 'Perfect Strangers' by Deep Purple, 'The Rover' & 'Achilles Last Stand' & 'The Song Remains The Same' all by Led Zepplin. At the end is an interesting medley of different cover songs, consisting of 'In The Flesh' by Pink Floyd, 'Carry On Wayward Son' by Kansas, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' by Queen, 'Lovin, Touchin, Squeezin' by Journey, 'Cruise Control' by Dixie Dregs, and 'Turn It On Again' by Genesis. If you've heard the originals, then you might appreciate these versions. For the most part, they stay true to the originals, though James Labrie's voice makes certain songs sound different. Pretty good covers overall, but after the massive title track, they will probably just seem like filler material, good for only the most die-hard fans.<br />Sois ACOS worth buying? Well, maybe. Though the title track is excellent, I only recommend actually buying this if A) You're already a pretty big DT fan who owns all the essential albums (I&W, Awake, Metropolis Pt:2, and Train Of Thought), B) It costs $10 or less, or C) You REALLY want to hear cover tunes. It's a decent pickup only after purchasing the aformentioned albums, but once again it's nothing absolutely essential. Hence the 3.5 star rating. RECOMMENDED TO THE BIGGER FANS OF DREAM THEATER.
B00005JMCW|5.0|I saw this movie with a bunch of my girl friends, and I can say we had a lot of fun watching the movie.  Lindsay Lohen played the part well, with her teenage tempertantrums and all.  It was a little overboard, but we got the message and the meaning of the switch.  I liked the characters, I laughed quite a lot, and I enjoyed the music.  I wish I could jam like that on my guitar.  Any girl would enjoy this movie.

Swiping her credit card sends some unexplained pleasure into her life. Her hilarious attempts of swaying the banks and creditors to sympathise with her left me thinking about this book and giggling even when I wasnt reading it!

B00005JL3A|1.0|This director really has only one good movie - \\"Event Horizon\\" - and everything else is just plain bad, Resident Evil being absolutely no exception to this general rule of thumb and God help \\"Aliens Vs Predator\\" with the way things are shaping up.<br />This film is marginally better than Ghosts of Mars, but only because Milla Jovovich goes around the place in a really very short mini-skirt and just happens to get skin sticking wet clothes towards the end of the picture. Overall the movie has extremely low production values and even lower prospects in the execution of the film. All of the sets looked contrived, i.e - they have no point being there other than to match scenes in the computer game or look interesting. Oh, yeah did we mention that this is based on a computer game? No, okay lets back up a bit here... Resident Evil just happens to be a really popular 3rd person zombie shoot 'em up horror survival game that they are now selling as a movie. Okay, let's move on...<br />When the actors in this film are more robotic than the characters in the game then you know something has gone seriously wrong... and it has. Nobody in the cast is mildly recognizable except for Milla Jovovich, and they shouldn't be either, because they all suck real bad. The camera work is some of the worse seen in a long time. Why? Because it attracts attention itself almost all of time. Bad cinematography. For 35mm it looks like it was shot on video. The lighting is pretty good whenever it turns on or off but when it is static it is just useless. The editing is extremely bad at times and cuts fail to match. From an atheistic standpoint its all terrible production values for a Hollywood budget. The CGI also happens to be extremely, EXTREMELY, dodgy most of the times. You know when the animation looks like animation? Well x 100 times worse is what you get here. It looks terribly fake, and even the dogs covered in RED PAINT look very cheesy. Overall this is a really really really very bad production. The story is worse and even some of the.......<br />Bah.<br />Forget about me writing anymore. Not worth it. Just go play the game instead.ction. The story is worse and even some of the.......<br />Bah.<br />Forget about me writing anymore. Not worth it. Just go play the game instead.
B000005RT8|1.0|And it took John Lennon's death shortly after this was released for Paul to write meaningful tunes again (like \\"Here Today\\" on Tug of War).  This is Paul at his most uncreative -- oh, he has the equipment, the money, the keyboards but no inspiration.  He doesn't know what to do with them and he has absolutely nothing to say.  Interesting that it was the live version of \\"Coming Up\\" -- not the techno mess on this album -- that was a hit.  Temporary Secretary is one of the most sexist songs ever written, an embarrassment and I wonder what John Lennon must have thought of it.  Waterfalls is the most insipid, uninspired, banal, never-ending songs he's ever written with lyrics like:  \\"I need love/like a minute needs an hour, like a raindrop needs a flower....\\" Good God is this the man who wrote at 23, \\"I'm not half the man I used to be\\"? Here he is at 38-- \\"Don't go chasing polar bears.\\"  This album was also released after Paul's arrest in Japan for carrying marijuana, when he promised he'd never smoke the weed again.  Perhaps this album shows what Paul really sounds when he's clean and sober.  When you have nothing to sing about, shut up.
0783235607|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out in 1960 before they changed the shower scene. It scared me to death. It is the scaries movie I have ever seen.  Even though they did change that scene because it was so bloody for that time period it is still a good and an scary movie. The part where the detective is going up the stairs and &quot;mother&quot; jumps out still scare's me. For a while when I would watch the movie over and over I still would not look during that scene. 5 star movie.<br />And the music was perfect and there is no way you can tell it is only string. Perfect
B000007638|4.0|This was my first concert at Madison Square Garden in the year of the bicentennial and the excitement we all felt at seeing Paul McCartney live cannot be captured on any album.  This live album -- despite the poor sound quality -- is important.  Before this, it had been George (with his Concert for Bangla Desh) and John Lennon with the Plastic Ono Band who had played the Garden as solo artists. Paul has no high-minded purpose here -- he shines with a mega-concert, a la mid 70's, with laser beams, the works!  He gives you your money's worth.   Some songs that appeared on Venus and Mars (Rock Show, Call Me Back Again, Listen to What the Man Said) sound better live.  Live and Let Die and Silly Love Songs don't sound any different from the studio versions.  The best cuts here are Maybe I'm Amazed (sung with unusual passion), Let Me Roll It and Jet.  The rest is just fluff --we know -- and songs by the other Wingsters serve to give  Paul a vocal break. Paul is an amazing bassist and here he struts his stuff.  Even Linda's presence can be overlooked. Anyone who grew up in the 70s can remember how the ex-Beatles didn't even want to be reminded of the Fab Four.  Here, Paul dares to sing Beatles songs! Some thought it a sacrilege then.  But do we really need the other three for &quot;Yesterday&quot;?This album has all the excesses of 70's rock shows, and Paul's ego shines in the midst of adulation --something he had not experienced since the Beatles breakup. Oh, this wasn't a cocert to help the starving people of BanglaDesh nor was it a Peace Concert.  This was pure fun, pure entertainment, quasi-rock and roll.  Take it for what it was.
B000002UJQ|5.0|In the darkness of the theatre, when I was getting his autograph, as he put his hand on my shoulder and started to cry, he said to me: \\"I think, my child, we've just made the greatest album of all time.\\"  Being a long time Radiohead supporter myself, I felt elated that one of my heros - Thom Yorke from radiohead - was predicting another great album so soon after the arrival of The Bends. So, as one might expect, a couple of weeks later, when ok Computer was finally released, I went out and brought myself a copy. I was not disappointed!! From the moment I put that CD into my disc tray and pressed the go button I felt truly alive. The cocktail of chemicals that are released into the brain when listening to ok Computer are a similar cocktail of chemicals that are released into the brain when taking cocaine or speed!
B00005LMBK|4.0|This album is great. LIke Many others, i got this because of the video Clint Eastwood and 19/2000. However the rest of the songs are different. The guys are cartoon characters and that caught alot of eyes. All of the songs on this CD are orinal and display great DJ skills. The Emcee shines everyonce in awhile. If you expect all of the songs to be like Clint Eastwood then you are wrong, but the playyful beat and melody makes you see the cartoons character doing what they are actually doing in your head.

B0000CDLA7|4.0|I can't stand it when I see people talking about how bad this CD is. The argument I see the most is that the song writing isn't good. That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. I haven't been listening to Dream Theater for all that long, but I own five of their albums including &quot;Scenes from a Memory,&quot; &quot;Images and Words, and &quot;Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence.&quot; Obviously, I also own &quot;Train of Thought,&quot; and it's the best one so far. &quot;Train of Thought&quot; is very different from any other Dream Theater album. It's heavier, the songs are longer, and most of all, it's actually more musically complicated. The songwriting is not simple or elementary. It's incredible. If you would actually sit down and pay attention to the music, you can hear all the things that make this album musically incredible. I am a serious guitar player and musician, so I always listen to music from that musical standpoint. The first time I listened to &quot;Train of Thought,&quot; I thought those same things...how Dream Theater hadn't lived up to their songwriting expectations. This album focuses a little bit more on the lyrics and on the singing. James Labrie's voice is the best it's ever been. After a couple more times of sitting through all the songs, I found that they're a lot more complicated than they seem. In that sense, Dream Theater did a better job with this album than any other. They kept all the weird time changes, key changes, and complicated song structure. They just made it less noticable. It's hard to explain, so what you should do is to ignore all negative reviews about this CD, buy it yourself, and you'll find out for yourself how good it is. If anything, you should buy the CD to hear &quot;Sream of Consciousness&quot; and &quot;In the Name of God.&quot; Those songs by themselves make the CD worth the price.
B000003B6J|5.0|i can't believe someone dissed this album and gave it only 3 stars.  Dumb reviewer said something about BDP productions... what?   This album gave everyone life.  this release spoke on all of us who were either a minority, poor or both! the reason they went platinum with NO AIR play is that everyone related to their rhymes.  they spoke the cold hard truth about our conditions in the ghetto and maed us laugh at the same time.  this shoudl go down as the most or one of the most important albums ever. period.  and the production was light years away.  dr. dre is a living legend.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|If the same CD had been made by a new artist with the same tunes, beats and even a worser voice, people wouldn't have slammed it down like this. It's just that people don't believe in giving a Britney a chance. I think this CD deserves a couple of listens before being slammed down. <BR>There's a whole load of vareity in the CD and Britney has done a great job on this one. I'm just wondering what she's gonna do next because she seems to have covered most of the different styles and beats all on this one. Maybe she'll switch to classical...lol. Just kidding.<BR>This is my favourite album since Stripped. I have to agree that even though Stripped is supported by Aguilera's powerful voice and great lyrics, In the Zone overdid Stripped by quite a big margin.  It's something new, filled with different good sounds and though Britney's voice is the worst in this album, she sings pretty decently.<BR>I advise to try it.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Great work. A blend of their old and new style and as good as anything they have ever done. Maiden is still doing it right after all these years. <BR>If your tired of the clone bands of radio and MTV then check out Iron Maiden. Also look at Bruce Dickenson's Chemical Wedding and Accident of Birth.

B00008J4P5|5.0|What a classic. Superior to every rock release of the year.<br /><br />This cd is my introduction to the white stripes. I'd heard `Seven nation army' and read tonnes of fantastic reviews and this made me curious.<br /><br />Recorded with just old `real' instruments, no computers or synths, the result is amazing.<br /><br />The stomping `Seven nation army' is brilliant. Meg White takes a turn on vocals for the tender `In the cold cold night'. The remake of 'I just don't know what to do with myself' with it's gentle/rocky treatment is wonderful.<br /><br />The punk rock of `Hypnotize' does just that. Other standouts include `The air near my fingers', the blues of 'Ball and biscuit', `The hardest button to button', and `It's true that we love one another' which sounds like it was recorded during a visit to a London pub.<br /><br />A brilliant cd.  Hard to see how Meg and Jack can surpass this, but I'm sure they will.

B000031WD9|2.0|Other than a few funny scenes, this comedy is boring. It takes teen movies to about the 12-year old level, so do not expect much. It is one of the most over-hyped films ever.

B00001OH7O|5.0|David Bowie's 1970 release The Man Who Sold the World announced the coming  of a great new rock artist.  The release of 1972's Hunky Dory announced its arrival.  Interestingly,  Hunky Dory sounded much different from its predecessor.  While the former record was heavy and dominated by Mick Ronson's always tasteful electric guitar, the dominant instrument on Hunky Dory is Rick Wakeman's piano, which takes the lead on several songs (and bears no resemblance to Wakeman's keyboards in Yes).  When the guitar takes over, it is more often than not acoustic, on tracks such as \\"Quicksand,\\" the dark \\"Andy Warhol,\\" and the extraordinary closer \\"The Bewlay Brothers.\\"  The electric guitar does almost all of its work on two songs: it is loud and raunchy on hard-rocking \\"Queen Bitch\\" and slower and more colorful on the plaintive \\"Song for Bob Dylan.\\"<br /><br />Clearly, this is a record of great variety, even though rarely moves beyond mid-tempo.  \\"Changes,\\" the disc's now all-too-familiar opener, is similar in structure to many of Hunky Dory's other songs: slower-tempo verses, mid-tempo choruses, and piano leads. Following this song - which probably sounded better in 1972 than it does now - the tempo remains in the slow-to-mid mode, picking up slightly on the string-adorned \\"Life On Mars?\\" and the Kinksy \\"Kooks,\\" a sincere and ever-so-slightly touching comment on Bowie's recent fatherhood.  It then backs up again for \\"Quicksand,\\" an acoustic, lyrically-cryptic lament sung from the perspective of a would-be - or wannabe - Nietzschean Superman who \\"ain't got the power anymore\\" to harness his alleged greatness. (Lyrical references to Nietzsche also pop up in \\"Oh! You Pretty Things.\\") This is probably the strongest song so far on the disc, and demonstrates that Bowie was just as effective with his voice and acoustic guitar as he was with his many experimental gestures.<br /><br />The slightly quicker tempo reappears on the sappy, harmless fun of \\"Fill Your Heart,\\" continues with the one-two punch of \\"Song For Bob Dylan\\" and \\"Andy Warhol,\\" and comes to a head on the only truly up-tempo song on the disc, \\"Queen Bitch.\\"  Then, it is right back to the sparse acoustics of the \\"The Bewlay Brothers,\\" a haunting tribute to Bowie's schizophrenic half-brother.  This is a particularly effective closer, as it allows the effect of the rest of the CD to settle a bit, and at the same time affects the listener in a whole new way.  It is also further evidence (along with songs such as \\"Quicksand\\") that, had he not chosen to become rock's consummate chameleon, Bowie could have ended up in many of the same sentences with Neil Young.<br /><br />When I first heard Hunky Dory, I considered it to be the greatest CD that I had ever heard.  I no longer feel this strongly about it (even hearing Ziggy Stardust shortly thereafter made me start to wonder), but its virtues are still just as obvious.  The variety in moods always keeps the listener interested, and the fact that there is only one familiar track on the disc (\\"Changes\\") makes it an ideal place to appreciate Bowie's range (assuming that you already know his \\"hits.\\")  Furthermore, Hunky Dory is the last time for a decade that Bowie would not rely on an alter ego (eg, Ziggy Stardust, Alladin Sane) or a midwife - such as Brian Eno - to bring his ideas to life.  While Bowie's self-conscious experimentation was very fruitful, the absence of it here is quite refreshing, as whatever multiple personalities he may have are revealed through the variety of the songs themselves.<br /><br />The fact that Bowie is more \\"himself\\" on Hunky Dory makes two of the disc's lyrics - in the first and last songs, no less - all the more interesting.  In \\"Changes,\\" Bowie says, \\"So I turned myself to face me/But I never caught a glimpse/Of how others must see the faker....\\"  In \\"The Bewlay Brothers,\\" he says, \\"Oh, we were gone/Real cool traders/We were so turned on/You thought<br />we were fakers.\\"<br /><br />Bowie seems to be aware of thepossibility that, as a performer, he may come across as inauthentic in the eyes of others.  On future recordings, he would abandon almost all pretense of<br />\\"being himself,\\" and whole-heartedly celebrate the possibility of having multiple personalities.  On Hunky Dory, however, he is still David Bowie, the solo singer/songwriter.  Even if he did abandon this role almost completely with his next album, he clearly went out with a bang.possibility that, as a performer, he may come across as inauthentic in the eyes of others.

B0000AOV85|5.0|Many people and online sellers present this DVD as the Making Of The Dark Side... . It's is far more than just that. It's a comprehensive retrospective of the album and its context narrated by every band member, producer, journalist and even the sound engineer (Alan Parson). It includes previously unreleased portions of tracks, solos and choruses from the original DSOTM songs. You can also see Waters, Gilmour and Wright fiddling their instruments while been interviewed and playing portions of Money, Time and The Great Gig... all of this in a quiet ambient, relaxed mood which besides gives us a glimpse of the man more than the musician. There's no footage from live concerts though, just still photos.<BR>Don't miss it by no means it is a must for every PF fan. A true 30 year anniversary homage to that masterpiece.

B00004RJ74|4.0|From Dusk to Dawn is well acted and directed but it's occasionly dumb too. I mean when the vampire band say \\"F this place\\" and just blow up has to be one of the dumbest things I seen in a movie. The movie still makes for an entertaining blood bath though. The performances by Harvey Keitel and George Clooney help make the movie watchable as well. Although the movie starts off like a Pulp Fiction style film in the first half it becomes Evil Dead with vampires in the second half. I mean George Clooney is pretty much like Ash (Evil Dead) and the vampires seem more like the demons in the Evil Dead movies than vampires.  Although the script is all over the place  Robert Rodriguez still manages to make it sexy and fun and it's still one of his better films.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|I loved this movie. In fact, I think it's the best of the three Matrix movies. It's big, it's loud, and it's a good conclusion to the trilogy, IMHO. I know a lot of people don't think that way, but I think it's a wonderful ending. I won't spoil anything, but if you go into it with an open mind, as opposed to the bias that most people had after seeing Reloaded, you'll enjoy it. A lot.
B00000DR5D|2.0|This is a cut and paste job of live concerts and overdubbed studio material that just doesn't make sense. This is the weak point in the Phaedra, Rubycon and Stratosfear line up.  Since one of the concerts Ricochet was taken from was the Croydon concert buy the official Tangerine Bootleg Box Set instead. You can hear the Croydon concert in its entirety as well as many others. Ricochet is just a plain bummer and the irritating vocal effects that were no way a part of any of their concerts have got to go. If you've got the money spend it on the box set instead.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|I think it's ridiculous that so many of these reviews have said that the album does not &quot;measure up&quot; to previous albums.  Like most, my favorite album is also FTE, but I felt that in songs like &quot;Stupid&quot; and &quot;Perfect Girl&quot; there is a maturity and a passion in her voice that only comes with perfecting her craft as long and with as much integrity as she has.<br />It is preposterous that anyone would deem this album merely &quot;a product.&quot;  Phases of life change, experiences change and musical styles slightly change.  A true fan will grow with the artist as the artist writes for their new experiences.<br />Other impressive contributers were Pierre Marchand (of course!) and the phenomenal bass stylings of Mr. Tony Levin.  I recommend this album to all, but please, keep an open mind and listen to it like you're listening to Sarah as a first-time artist again.
B00003CXWV|5.0|I rate this movie a 5 because of how johnny depp is able to catch the real person behind the preformance. He was able to portray George Jung with only the best of acting. also penelope was wonderful as she played the drug addicted wife with her fair share of crazy moments.
B000002KHH|5.0|I can tell you right off the bat this Black Sabbath album is like a Greatest Hits compilation. Here are all of the songs and my opinion of them.<br />War Pigs / Luke's Wall: This would be one of Black Sabbath's best. It is about the Vietnam and well, you should know the rest.<br />Paranoid: This is another of BS's best, no BS does not stand for anything else. This song explains me a whole lot. I was kidding. Ha Ha. Whatever.<br />Planet Caravan: I never really listen to this song at all. I know it is slow, it's worth a listen though.<br />Iron Man: My second favorite BS song. This is easy to play on guitar but that ain't my point. I listen to this song and the next to get me in a good mood. Long Live The IRON MAN! That made no sense. <br />Electric Funeral: This is my favorite BS song ever. It has an awesome guitar sound. This could have been a good title track, but oh well.<br />Hand Of Doom: You have to listen to this song for a minute to get into the BLACK SABBATH METAL kind of sound. Awesome song.<br />Rat Salad: INSTRUMENTALLY CHALLENGED! This is my favorite instrumental of all time. Its a little to short though. This song has an awesome-cheesy name. You probably already noticed that.<br />Jack the Stripper / Fairies Wear Boots: This is one of my other very-favorites. I love this song to creeping death.<br />I am not a bad guy, i'm just a little PARANOID! (chainsaw cranking in background)<br />Please Note: What I just said is not a line in any of the tracks on this #1 BS cd.
6305364648|5.0|I pity the people who review this film as 1 star on grounds that it is racist and sadist. This is a great film, original, witty and thoroughly entertaining - one of those one you can watch again and again.<br />To people (or pansies) who find the interrogation scenes sadistic and 'terryfying' please get a life. If you found that terryfying then god knows how peopale like you are able to survive in this world.<br />Oh and the selfish just could't leave racism out of this one could we? Whenever someone metions 'Islamic terroism' there is an upwoar of racism related publicity. The fact remains that there does exist Islamic terrorist in the world and if you don't like it portrayed in pictures then I suggest you change your faith.

0312305060|5.0|i am always surprised by male authors who write women so honestly and well; and Cunningham is no exception. The Hours is a gorgeously written novel of three intertwining stories of three women in three different eras. I don't feel like i can do it any sort of justice, so i will just tell you that it is absolutely brilliant, and should be a mandatory read for the entire nation, a new classic
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is an astounding piece of work.  It is well worth watching over and over again.  <BR>The only disappointment is that the series was cancelled after 14 episodes.
B00006RINF|3.0|This is a good effort for Lacuna Coil, but it's my least favorite.    I like some songs like &quot;Entwined&quot;, &quot;Heaven's A Lie&quot;, &amp; &quot;Self Deception&quot; but this disc isn't the Lacuna Coil I love and know.  I'm glad that they had a song on MTV2's Headbanger's Ball compilation because we need to listen to a good group like this.  I wish Lacuna Coil would get more recognition than Evanescence cause they can't hold a candle to Coil.  This is a good place to start if you're just getting to know the band, but as I say, this is only my opnion so the final decision is up to you.
0316666343|4.0|Sebold describes the book in a paragraph, the preface. A penguin trapped in a snow globe, all alone, and when Susie told her father this, 'he said, &quot;Don't worry Susie; he has a nice life. He's trapped in a perfect world.&quot;<br />Sebold writes a tragic tale about the life after death of Susie Salmon. &quot;I was fourteen when I was murdered on December 6, 1973.&quot; is the second line in. The book is well paced, intertwining the lives of Susie in heaven, and her loved ones on earth. Sebold describes heaven and Susie's feelings with a knowledge we don't have. The book treads a fine line between graceful and astonishing, and vulgar and unreal.<br />`The Lovely Bones' is a compelling read, the pages kept turning. It was strangely suspenseful, as Susie watched from her own perfect world as life on earth went on without her, the lives of those on earth slowly falling apart. Sebold draws upon what we take for granted in life, the experiences, the firsts, as the important parts of real adolescence. Susie Salmon is the girl, brutally raped and murdered by her neighbor, Mr. Harvey, who misses out on all the experiences, forever remaining fourteen years old. Susie Salmon is trapped in heaven, perfect, but less than that. <br />Throughout the book, Sebold keeps us sad but occupied with the beautiful story. But by the end, the tragic beautiful tale is no longer there. The ending ties up all loose strings a little too well. The book illustrated a heaven where all our desires would come true, a brutal death by a serial killer, and the love and pain of the family and friends, but the end left me unsatisfied. It ended too well for a story with a heaven that lasts forever. I was left curious, with a shallow impression in my mind of the ending. Nevertheless, `The Lovely Bones' is a book I would recommend to anybody interested. It's a quick read, evoking feelings and thoughts as you turn the pages.<br />Sebold crafts a brilliant book of the forever adolescence of Susie Salmon,like the fish.
B00005JL2O|2.0|Not bad, but I seriously think that the AUSTIN POWERS horse has run it's course. Let me put it this way, I liked Goldmember more than I did \\"Wayne's World 2\\" but nowhere near as much as I liked \\"So I married an axe murderer\\"  Stick to Shrek Mike, or invent something new, your'e clever enough!!
B0000DYJM6|5.0|After my flatmate got this cd I immediately asked me to get one for me as well. Since then I have been listening to it pretty much constantly. Pearl Jam has always been my favourite band, so I was bound to like the cd anyway, but nevertheless I have loved every single song on Lost Dogs. <br />I agree that including songs such as I got ID, Leatherman, Long road, etc would have been helpful, since even if they can be downloaded it would be nice to have them on the one cd. <br />Stand out songs on Lost Dogs for me are Sad, Alone, Hold on, yellow ledbetter, footsteps, wash, dirty frank, brother... there really isn't any songs that I'd skip.
B00000K0T8|5.0|All the Wu Tang Clans first solo cd's are classics! However, of all my Wu Tang Cd's, this is still the one I listen to the most, as the layered beats and incredible lyrics sound as fresh today as they did back in 1996. Ghostface Killah has to have one of the dopest styles out there in rap today. It is a tragedy that in 2003-04, hip hip is truly dead, and that they do not make albums this good anymore. The mid 1990's were truly the best years in hip hop....
0385504209|5.0|Either you love or hate this book.  I am a &quot;religious&quot; person and I love the facts brought out in this book.  It gave me a new look on things and is causing me to do my our study.  This book had a great story that keeps you turning the page.  This author is great!  He holds on to you until the last chapter.  MUST BUY!
0385509456|3.0|The book is basically a diary written by fifteen year old autistic Christopher, about the events after he found his neighbours dog Wellington, with a garden fork sticking out of its corpse. Initially against his father, neighbour (owner of the dead dog), teacher, police and other people's advice and wishes he keeps bugging everyone in the street to see if they know who killed Wellington.<br />Eventually he stumbles upon the truth then flees to London to escape the killer who will not stop until he gets hold of Christopher.  All Christopher is really worried about is doing his A-Level Math test, because he likes Maths.  Doesn't really care at all about his father or others who are sacrificing their lives to make him comfortable and happy.<br />For readers who are unfamilair with autistic people they may unfairly assume this is a symptom of the condition which it certainly is not. Most autistic people do not act in the selfish ways Christopher does.  Sure some do, but so do some so called 'normal' people too.  My main problem with this book is that at no point is the reader ever told by the author that Christopher like any other human is choosing some of the actions he takes and ways he treats others.  People unfamiliar with autism may read this book and assume all autistic people will be violent or treat others with contmept etc. Sure some do but most do not. I understand this is Christopher's journal and he is unlikely to write anything critisising himself but since so many readers obviously assume he is a typical example of an autisitc individual the author needed to have made this clear in some way.<br />This book may not be very good in quality, is very predictable and the characters not very likeable, but make no mistake about it, it is very addictive.  For reasons I really do not understand, there was no way I could put this thing down until the last page which is why I rate this book three stars. I think some people rate this book highly purely for the fact it contains an autistic lead character and this somehow makes them feel beter about themselves, rather than actually rating the book on its quality.t it contains an autistic lead character and this somehow makes them feel beter about themselves, rather than actually rating the book on its quality.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|A7X. Remember this band. One day, no matter what you say, they will be remembered for the geniusness and brilliancy of this CD. Avenged Sevenfold has brought everyhting together in this CD that any hardcore/metal/screamo/thrash/guitar virtuoso fan could ever love. The intricate soloing and extreme diversity of this CD make it a work of art. Everything that could possibly be good and loved in the scene of metal and hardcore is used and mastered on this CD. They are truly a band of the times, molding every element they could to produce this 68 minute masterpiece. If the rest of the CD didnt blow my mind, I get onto 'I won't see you tonight part 1' and love every second of the 9 minute song. Then, I get to 'I won't see you tonight part 2', and every single element I love in music that wasnt already used in part 1, was used in part 2. Its like they anticipated part one not satisfying completely while its still a beautiful song, and made part 2, heavy, to the point, metal/hardcore/thrash, while still making a reference back to one of the best parts of part 1. Genius. I can't imagine ever hearing a CD that, overall, adds up to the magnificence of Avenged Sevenfold - Waking The Fallen. Great CD, not one bad song. Sheer and total Bliss.
1401300901|4.0|Its an enjoyable read if not slightly predicatble. By all accounts there is a movie planned and one can see how the story will adapt to screen. <br />If you have a loved one you have to buy a gift for then this would be a good choice. <br />What I liked about the book is that it's a rare insight into contemporary Ireland as oppossed to some of the worn cliches that tend be depicited in book and film. For that it should be praised.<br />The subtext from her official website, [...] seems to suggest that a sequel is in the pipeline.
0060273224|5.0|From the moment I opened the book to the last words, Garth Nix kept me on my toes.  The mixture of love, friendships and adventure sustained the grip on me to continue reading.  Suspence and mystery of the Old kingdom and of the destiny, which has suddenly fallen into the hands of the young hero's is what pulled me into the story as well as the very real characters.  The good versus evil plot was well displayed and very realistic to young readers such as myself.  Garth Nix is a fantastic writer for young adults and readers of any age, Sabriel as well as Lireal, and Abhorsen  are the best books I have read in a long time.
B00005KHJM|5.0|Right as the Hammer horror films were slowly dying out, \\"The Wicker Man\\" appeared and shocked the British horror scene. Written by playwright Anthony Schaffer (author of the hit play and movie \\"Slueth\\") \\"The Wicker Man\\" is a horror film heavy on realistic drama and scene setting, atmosphere and performance, and an intelligent examination of ancient English pagan religions. It was unlike any horror film made up to that time, but many others would follow its example of a realistic approach to the fright flick. Even today, it still has a hypnotic power to pull audiences into its believable world where pagan and druidic rites still survive in beautiful corners of the English isles, and the trick-switch ending is still as shocking and horrifying as ever. Christopher Lee, veteran of many gothic thrillers and horror movies, credits this as his favorite of all his movies, and it's easy to see why. This is one film you won't soon forget.<br />A police officer (Woodward, in a superb performance that's both prudish and angry), arrives at the isolated Scottish island of Summerisle, where Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee, brilliant as usual and enjoying getting away from the Dracula Character) lords over a revival of an old pagan fertility religion. Woodward, a devout Christian, searches for a missing girl and becomes more and more horrified at the sexual practices and religious ideas of the otherwise incredibly pleasant people of Summerisle. But the greatest horror is waiting just beneath his gaze...The Wicker Man.<br />The DVD has a great print of the film, with 5.1 surround sound to present the wonderful soundtrack of tradition Scottish tunes. There's also a revealing 35-minute documentary with interviews with writer Schaffer (soon before his death), Christopher Lee, Edward Woodward, plus the director and almost all the creative people involves. You'll get to see the filming locations as they look today, and be amazed that they haven't changed at all! (But by all means, DON'Twatch the documentary before the film; it will spoil the ending for you.)<br />Even if you claim to dislike horror movies, you should check out \\"The Wicker Man.\\" It is filled with intelligence and ideas that will have you thinking about it for days afterwards. Only a select few horror films can boast of that. (But if casual nudity offends you, as it does Edward Woodward's character, you might want to skip it. You'll still be missing out.)
B00006879E|5.0|this is a great record, the pop rock hit \\"harder to breath\\" is not representative of the cd, its jazzy and soulful and totally sexy. great music, good lyrics, what more can you ask for? this band is the perfect blend of slick packaging and catchy tunes with real emotions and substance. best track: sweetest goodbye noteworthy: she will be loved, this love, and secret.
B00005JLR2|2.0|Within the first few minutes of this science-fiction adaptation of Stevenson's TREASURE ISLAND, you'll be amazed with the vibrant blend of hand-animation and CGI movement. <br />Within the next few minutes, you'll be bored with the flat charactetizations, forced unfunny humor, and lazy by-the-numbers transcription of the novel's plot into a poorly thought-out science-fiction universe. <br />This is Disney at its most superficial and cold. Science-fiction fans will be frustrated with the shallow and dismissive explanations for the background (why, given all this technology, do people wield swords and use ropes to tie themselves to decks -- and what are they breathing, anyway?), most adults will tire of the bland dramatics, and only the youngest kids will stay awake for most of it. Martin Short's malfunctioning robot must be one of the least funny of Dinsey's comic-relief characters. Rent LILO &amp; STITCH instead if you have kids (or just rent it again). If you want more intelligent adult science-fiction animation, check out the similarly titled but completely different FANTASTIC PLANET. The little seen TITAN A.E. also explores the space opera animation setting in a much more satisfactory way. Even DreamWorks SINBAD: LEGEND OF THE SEVEN SEAS is more enjoyable.
B000089RVX|5.0|this is a great record, especially if youre 16, confused &amp; angry, and a girl. just about every song on this cd is exciting, amy lee has a great voice full of emotion backed up by the alt rock metal tunes. i guarantee you will feel her pain. the only no-no is where she says &quot;i want to die&quot; on one the songs, i think thats a bad message to send to kids who are young and might be suicidal. it might be truthful but its a terrible message. she should have said &quot;i want to die, but i wont because....&quot; <br />note: my immortal is a real song (not the radio bastardized nickel back'ed version) <br />this is the kind of cd you get obsessed with but tire of quickly. maybe stick to the mp3s?
B000002B7Y|5.0|MY OPINION: This is my favorite of Ozzy's albums, and my friends always say I've crazy because of that, but it is. This album also debuted by favorite guitar player and my hero, Zakk Wylde. The album has 4 masterpieces on it. Ok, on to the review<br />SONGS:<br />1. Miracle Man-One of the masterpieces on here. It's about TV evangelists. 10/10<BR>2. Devil's Daughter-This is the only song on the album that I dont' like. It's lame. 5/10<BR>3. Crazy Babies-This song is ok, but it's still lame. 8/10<BR>4. Breakin' All The Rules-This song is  cool. The riff is awesome and the song is just good 10/10<BR>5. Bloodbath In Paradise-This is 1 of the other masterpieces on this album. It's about Charles Manson. 10/10<BR>6. Fire In The Sky-Another 1 of the albums masterpieces. It's friecken awesome. 10/10<BR>7. Tatooed Dancer-This songs ok, but it's not one to remember. The one on Just Say Ozzy is better. 8/10<BR>8. Demon Alcohol-The last masterpiece on the album, and a just flat out awesome rocker. 10/10<br />BOTTOM LINE: This is Ozzy's second most underrated album and it is definatly worth the money to get it. EVERYONE GO OUT AND BUY IT NOW!!! STOP READING THIS AND GO BUY THE ALBUM!!
B0000DD7LB|4.0|many more good songs than youd expect. though im concerned for britney and what she seems to value in her life. she needs to find god or something deeper than \\"sexy jeans and pink baby tees\\" songs like outrageous, toxic, brave new girl, boom boom (all great) then she has a more sensitive turn with shadow and the justin rebuttal. bravo brit, just try to class it up.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|the moving music is a high complament to Jacksons epic addaption of the J.R.R.

B00005QDW1|2.0|no doubt has changed. at first i felt betrayed but ive had some time to cope and im ok with it. gwen is so watered down on this cd, she only sings about partying. some of the songs are good but this is no tragic kingdom or return of saturn. best tracks: in my head, platinum blond life. there are a lot of good songs on here, but dont expect to think about anything real or be able to apply the lyrics to your life or what youre feeling, unless youre a jetsetting trillionare play girl-popstar.
B00001OH7U|5.0|The mid-1970's were a stressful time for David Bowie. His marriage to the obnoxious Angela Bowie was disintegrating, he had become a top-notch coke freak, and was convinced that practitioners of black magic were out to get him. He had laid his Ziggy Stardust persona to rest, in favor of a white-boy soul man character, which was not as well-received as he had hoped. While his \\"Young Americans\\" album was a bold step in a new direction, it did not receive the kind of adoration that Bowie had become accustomed to. Somehow, while fighting with dictatorial manager Tony Defries, sorcerers, and the homosexual image he had created for himself, David managed to come up with an absolutely brilliant album that retains the disco-funk of \\"Americans\\", but pushes it into a whole new direction. The persona that dominates this album is that of the Thin White Duke, an aristocratic European fellow who likes to cruise around in limos, binged out on cocaine, his head swimming in fascist paranoid fantasies (someone once told me that \\"Station To Station\\"-era Bowie was one of the people Pink Floyd based \\"The Wall\\" on. I cannot verify this but it seems plausible). So self-absorbed was David during this era that he actually made his band play behind a backdrop during concerts, so that he could be the one and only center of the audience's attention. One look at the photos inside the CD booklet (David, looking like a famished hairdresser in sore need of a dental hygienist, scribbling kabbalistic desings on an asylum floor) will clue the listener in to Bowie's frame of mind at the time. The songs themselves are the antithesis of the shallow yet groovy preceding album; the hooks are there, but not as contrived sounding. The title track starts off slow and menacing, then builds to a disco crescendo that could take the Bee Gees on anyday. \\"Stay\\" is fast and funky, \\"Word On A Wing\\" is very heartfelt and seeminly religious, \\"Golden Years\\" (the closest thing to a hit here) is a doo-woppy dance tune that Dave supposedly wrote about Angela (who was also the inspiration behind the Rolling Stones' \\"Angie\\"). \\"TVC 15\\" seems to be the favorite of most, dealing as it does with a carnivorous television. And finally, \\"Wild Is The Wind\\", while not written by Bowie, has to be one of his most heart-felt performances. This album was the transition into a more experimental phase of Bowie's career, and I strongly recommend it.

B0000DIXRU|2.0|This album thoroughly disappointed me.  I had been holding my breath for two years for this record, and when I put it in, I was blown away; but not in a good way.  There's not much to say, except that the overall quality of the songs is mediocre at best, and John Douglas (who has always been such a tasteful drummer) somehow manages to heavy-handedly destroy every song that had a possibility of being enjoyable.  I hope this album is just a fluke and that Anathema has not left us forever...

B0000DJZA5|5.0|More than 30 years after the original version of &quot;Let it Be&quot; was released, Paul McCartney wanted the &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;naked&quot; version of this collection re-released with one chief difference - the unadorned Beatles.<br />The original album/CD had Phil Spector's adding an orchestra to the songs.  The &quot;naked&quot; version is just the Beatles in their musical purity with no orchestral arrangement.  It is pure, pristine and fresh and crisp.  In fact, I prefer the de-Spectorized &quot;Let it Be Naked&quot; to the original.<br />Each time I listen to this, I feel as if I am getting a bonus treat.  The clear, pure sound of the unaccompanied Beatles makes for a more pleasant listening experience for me.  I love it!

B0000CEB4V|5.0|This is a beautiful and deeply moving concert.  Artists who personally knew George Harrison and/or had worked with him stepped up to the plate to honor him and his lifetime artistic achievements.  Former Beatle bandmates Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney were among those paying tribute to George Harrison.<br />An excellent selection of Harrisongs from the Beatle years to his solo work are covered; I especially loved the working of the 1966 Harrison classic &quot;I Want to Tell You,&quot; which remains one of my favorite songs to this day.<br />Please treat yourself to this because it is very moving and a treat for the ears.  Please also treat yourself to the solo works of George Harrison.  He was and will remain a nonpareil, exceptional talent.
0385504209|5.0|This is definitely a novel that I won't soon forget and will read again in the future.  There are many facts to learn in this book.  The only difficult thing to remember is that there are also fictional elements as well and it is sometime difficult to distinguish between them.<br />Brown has written a story the way it should be written.  It is thrilling and leaves the reader wanting more.  The story is a maze of ancient themed riddles that involve the most famous famous works of art, mythology, and history.  I was fascinated by the many turns of events and now consider this book among my favorites.  A definite recommendation for The Da Vinci Code!

B00003ETOW|4.0|Oh, come on y'all...I admit I did not read all 29 other reviews, but this is NOT the worst movie ever made.   I recently bought this DVD.  The last time I saw this was on TV in 1971,  I think it was a Hallmark Hall of Fame production?  Anyway I remembered loving it and when I saw it again I still loved it.  Has there ever been a plain Jane?  of course not.  Scott's Mr. Rochester came across as a man who has seen a lot of wear and tear in his efforts to forget his problems.  Here he gradually wakes up to the possibility of a new life.  He is reluctant, conflicted but unable to resist trying somehow to win Jane and begin again.<BR>The script dealt very well with the made-for-TV constraints.  The writer did not have the luxury of using big chunks of dialogue stright from the book, as the BBC might do (there is a wonderful Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke version that does just that) but zips along with great concision, hitting the high points with economy and clarity.  This version tries to recast the characters' concern in modern terms and I think succeeds without seeming too dated thirty years on.<BR>An the music is beautiful.  It's like another character - the theme stayed with me all these years and it is as pretty and haunting as I remember.<BR>And yeah, it was a nice production but the quality of the DVD is not very good.  But not bad enough to keep me from enjoying it.
0345452577|4.0|A wonderful book, full of insight, well-drawn characters, and the human element. But be warned:  it can also be as disturbing, dangerous, and graphic.  That said, I loved it and couldn't put it down. I highly recommend this one.<br />Also recommended:  The Da Vinci Code and Bark of the Dogwood by Jackson McCrae
0140143505|4.0|Though I somehow just went a week without finishing any of the books I've been reading (thank you upcoming store inventory, *grumble*), I must say this little gem got me through some of the worst of it!  This book is just beautiful.<BR> <BR>It is, put far too simply, a collection of letters between an American lady of fabulous wit and sarcasm and a few people of Marks &amp; Co., a British bookstore on 84, Charing Cross Road.  The letters suck you right in - what Helen says, one cannot help but read, and the wonderfully phrased return letters from (mostly) Frank Doel always made me chuckle in a &quot;Gosh, I remember living in England,&quot; way.  This is a correspondance that covers two decades, and though I often felt like some of the letters were missing (there are replies to questions you never see asked), it was a delight to read this.<BR> <BR>It's rare I enjoy a nonfiction book that isn't on one of the narrow topics I enjoy, and biographical correspondance isn't normally something I pay attention to.  Still, this is fabulous, and I suggest you go grab a copy, a cuppa, and just enjoy!<BR> <BR>'Nathan
B00005U8EM|5.0|Everybody would probably like to re-live one day of his or her life. Everyone makes a mistake or two that they'd like to fix. But what if you had to live the same day over again, and again, and again, and again...?<br />Phil Connors goes through this strange cycle of life in &quot;Groundhog Day,&quot; an undeniably strong comedy that features a great script and cast. It's like a Frank Capra story with sarcasm. And it works perfectly.<br />Bill Murray plays Connors with all the air of a frustrated cynical everyman who is fed up with his job and life. Phil is a weatherman for a local news station, and every year he goes to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania for the Punxsutawney Phil event: commonly recognized as Groundhog Day. You know how it goes. The groundhog comes out on February 2nd. If it sees its shadow, it's six more weeks of winter. If it doesn't, it's spring. <br />Well, the only problem about going to this event every year for Phil is that he hates it. He hates the cheery people. The little town. The weather. The event. The story. Everything. He hates it. He is a lonely, desolate, forsaken soul. With a great cynical side.<br />Andie McDowell plays a new manager--err, womanager--who goes with Phil to the event, along with Chris Elliot, the cameraman. Phil reports, they tape it, it's a done deal. The end. Phil goes back home. It happens every year, and this year should be no exception.<br />Keyword: Should.<br />Because this year isn't like most years. Due to severe weather, the roads have all been closed, leaving only one option: Stay in Punxsutawney until the storm blows over. So, Phil heads back to his cheery hotel, and tucks in for a dreaded nap. But when he wakes the next morning, something odd happens. The day is the exact same day as before. It is Groundhog Day. <br />Again.<br />Waking up to the same Sonny and Cher song as the morning before, Phil panics as he finds everything exactly the same, just as it was the day before. He knows everything that is goingto happen. He shrugs it off as a weird case of deja vu and heads back to sleep. But when he wakes up, alas! The day is...yesterday--again. Well, technically.<br />So Phil comes to terms with the fact that there is now way out of this small little town. He tries everything. He steps in front of a moving car. He electrocutes himself. He jumps off a building. All to no avail. Oh, he dies, all right. But the next day he's back and it's Groundhog Day again.<br />Part of what makes &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; so excellent is the story. The characters and actors alone are great enough to recommend this movie, but the truth is, I cannot think of a better story to throw someone like Bill Murray into. He uses his smart-alecky ways to a new extreme. His character is a bit like Scrooge from the tale &quot;A Christmas Story,&quot; which is ironic, because Murray was in a parody on Scrooge's tale called &quot;Scrooged.&quot;<br />But regardless, Bill Murray is perfect as the irreverent and cynical Phil. Everything he does he carries out with a dumb, &quot;I'm-smarter-than-you&quot; face. He considers himself better than everyone else. He thinks he is smart by skipping the big Holiday ordeal. It is all so stupid to him. But, as this story teaches us, having an attitude like that can get you in big trouble.<br />Another thing that is great about &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; is that Phil Connors does what we would do. For example: When he finds out he has this ability to repeat the same day over and over, he does things the average person would do. The human weakness. Too many comedies with the same formula don't try to exploit this human weakness, but &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; does. We see Phil memorize the steps to successfully robbing an armored truck filled with cash. But the reason he can go to bed with a clear conscience is because he knows the next day that everything will be back to normal again. He will never have robbed the truck; never have bought a Ferrari, etc. Phil does what WE would do, and that is one importance aspect of &quot;Groundhog Day.&quot; I would never rob an armored truck, but if I was stuck living the same day over and over, it would do no harm to take the cash--it would be back in the truck in the morning! So, I might do that. (Although my conscience would still get in the way.) <br />There was a little comedy a few years ago that starred John Candy. The movie was named, &quot;Delirious,&quot; and it was about a soap opera writer who bumped his head and woke up trapped inside his own written world. And everything he would write on his typewriter came true. <br />I was reminded of that film while watching &quot;Groundhog Day,&quot; which is undeniably a stronger comedy. While the movie &quot;Delirous&quot; was good, and pretty interesting, there were so many things Candy could have done with the ability to create and control everything, and he didn't do them. I think that's where &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; steps in, filling in the blanks. There's nothing I love more than watching a comedy where the main character divulges into the human nature.<br />In other words, I love watching characters on-screen giving in to the same human weaknesses that we all exhibit.<br />And that's exactly what Phil does in &quot;Groundhog Day.&quot; And that is why, among other reasons, it is one of my favorite films.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|This cd is very good and definitely worth purchasing. All the songs are nice, but my favorite has to be #7(DIARY). This is definitely a cd for &quot;grown people&quot;. If you like REAL music then this is the cd for you. If you're in to that pop crap where half of the artists can't sing then go buy Britney's s***.
6305127697|4.0|With each and every passing of a week it becomes evidently clearer that Hollywood's fixation on making the almighty dollar is much more important than creating quality material. Alas, when the great films do eventually come our way, they seem like masterpieces. Hence this entire \\"Lord of the Rings\\" craze.<br />\\"Primal Fear\\" is a quiet masterpiece. It's an Oscar contender at heart, hidden beneath a layer of assorted cliches and plot twists. Does that mean the movie is bad? Not by a long shot. It's terribly entertaining and splendidly acted, particularly by a young Edward Norton. It's a fine movie in almost every respect, although it has a few minor flaws that prevent it from becoming completely excellent.<br />In a nutshell: Norton is the 19-year-old who kills the archbishop of a church in Chicago; Gere is his attorney who takes on the case. <br />Gere doesn't care whether his clients are guilty or not. \\"I just do my job. It's not like I'm friends with them,\\" he says. But he connects with his newest client in a way unlike he ever has before. \\"I think he's innocent,\\" he tells one of his co-workers. \\"I think he's telling the truth.\\"<br />The stuttering 19-year-old Kentucky boy has no clear motive for killing the archbishop. They are related only through the fact that he was a choirboy for the church and the archbishop had taken him in off the streets. But the clues start to connect and soon they find out that sweet ol' choirboy may have split personality disorder--his other side, Roy, comes into play when his normal side becomes hassed and hurt. The stutters fade away and an evil side shines through--an evil side that admits to killing the archbishop.<br />Of course, we all know that it doesn't stop there. Movies like these never stop once they start going; it's like when you flatten a poster and it keeps rolling back up. Only in this case, everything's unrolling itself until we finally get to see the full picture on the front of the poster. Sometimes it's different than we think it'll be. Sometimes it's exactly what we knew it looked like.<br />The latter is the case with \\"Primal Fear.\\" I guessed every twist early on, and who didn't see the ending coming? But this is simply one of the best Hollywood thrillers in years. When the twists finally reveal themselves, the impact is still as startling as if you were totally blown away and unsuspecting of any more surprises.<br />The cast is certainly top-notch. Along with Gere and the then-unknown Norton, there is Frances McDormand, Laura Linney, John Mahoney and Steven Bauer (Tony's pal from DePalma's \\"Scarface,\\" in case you're wondering).<br />Richard Gere is undeniably good at playing lawyers. He played one in \\"Chicago\\" last year, and he also plays one in \\"Primal Fear\\" (which takes place in Chicago). The reason, I think, is because he's sleazy--or at least good at playing sleazy. He was sleazy in \\"Pretty Woman\\" and pretty close to a lawyer there. \\"Primal Fear\\" is one of his greatest roles--but he's really not the reason it works.<br />Edward Norton makes this film work. It takes a great kind of character actor to be able to play such versatile roles, like the stuttering farmboy in \\"Primal Fear\\" and the mentally-challenged-conman-who-isn't-really-mentally-challenged in \\"The Score\\" (another terrific film). In the same vein of \\"Fight Club,\\" this is a film about identities and coming to terms with the fact that you aren't who you think you are--which is, in a way, one of Hollywood's most overused ideas as of recent years. (\\"Total Recall,\\" \\"Identity,\\" \\"Impostor,\\" \\"Fight Club,\\" \\"The Matrix,\\" \\"The Thirteenth Floor,\\" etc.) <br />But this is one of the best examples of the formula done justice.
B00006879E|4.0|I first heard of this band in the middle of 2003. Nothing spectacular, I thought. I just recently decided to give them another chance, and I am glad I did. Their mix of white-guy funk, rock and R&amp;B is blended with a practised hand. They manage to sound fresh, not by re-inventing the wheel, but by revitalizing classic techniques with new ideas. Their first two singles, &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot; and &quot;This Love&quot; are great introductions to this band. And is it just me, or they sound kind of like old-school Chicago (the 70's Chicago sound)? Maybe that's why I like Maroon 5 so much...
B00005JLXE|4.0|I bought Daredevil without having seen it in the theater and really enjoyed the movie since I was expecting a comic book style Daredevil movie with plenty of action and wasn't expecting Shakespeare. Im very impressed with this two disc set I just wish the menus weren't supposed to look like Daredevil's 'vision'. Better menus would have been nicer, but that's my one gripe since the extras are awesome and there's great behind the scenes stuff and informative interviews with various artists and writers of the comic. If you are an action/comic fan with reasonable expectations this is a set well worth purchasing.
B0000C7GG2|5.0|&quot;Absolution&quot; is a beautifully haunting masterpiece, delivered by an insatiable band by the name of MUSE. insatiable in that it never fails to leave me wanting more, they've been on repeat ever since i brought home the cd. it feels as though they've thrown caution to the wind with this album and it works. these guys are freakin awesome. MUSE offer a brilliant epic quality to their listeners, creating a sort of wall of sound. &quot;Absolution&quot;, like their previous releases, is a cd of rich dense music, that is clever and thoughtful, combining breath-takingly striking piano, synthesisers, ghostly though luring strings, powerful guitar with strong effective riffs and driven drums. it is indeed a testament to their musical genius. they offer music that has their own definative sound and moves the soul. thats right, as the previous reviewer advised, this is an album to crank it up to and drown away those demons that may inhabit you. matt bellamys dark emotion filled vocals confront you immediately and, for me, has a feeling that it surrounds  and renders you powerless to his voice, drawing you into the music. he's about the vocal theatrics which could very easily have turned sour for MUSE, but its evident the outcome is nothing of the sort. it is indeed nothing short of glorious.  the collection of songs are poetic, eclectic and confrontational in lyric, they have a heart out in the open feel especially in combination with bellamys vocals. Favourites of mine on the cd are: the burst out Apocalypse Please that has a demanding emanace to it, with a kind of funeral march introduction, a blazing Time Is Running Out with a soaring chorus and seething vocals and some awesome raw guitaring, the brilliant Stockholm Syndrome which you'll just have to experience yourself and is in my opinion Muse at their best, Falling Away With You is beautiful and the band at one of their more subtle and delicate open moments on the album, the guitaring in Hysteria is absolutely awesome, at the solo you just want to die, the song as a whole is incredibly catchy and very driven, bellamys vocals are perfect and the video clip is a killer, Butterflies and Hurricanes,Thoughts Of A Dying Athiest and Ruled By Secrecy are also each unique from eachother and just as brilliant. In short if you like heart wrenching vocals, rich, full and strong instrumentals and music that is as a whole, thoughtful, intense with dark elelments and showcases masterful epic qualities, then let me just tell you, do not hesitate to buy Absolution. you will not be dissapointed.  &quot;This is the end of the world&quot; asserts Matt Bellamy in Apocalypse Please, well not for MUSE it isn't...
B0001BKAEY|3.0|Well, I was one of those die-hard fans who watched this the first day it came out and I was totally disappointed. I mean it's a great action sci-fi film, but NOT on par with the other two. If you rate Matrix: 10, Matrix Revolutions: 7, this one is 3 or 4 comparatively.<br />The story just died, the fight scenes were not as good (oh, what fight scene?), the performances were not as good, special effects were just ok (not Matrix level), there was too many questions unanswered, Zion battle reminded me of Armagadon, characters didn't fulfill their roles, didn't see much of the real world, didn't figure out more about last failures of men, who's the architect, now what that there's peace? etc... etc... etc...<br />At the end I felt it's hanging in the air with no proper ending. I believe they wanted to keep it open-ended so they can make more Matrix movies later, so they didn't give out any answers! That killed the movie, and that's why it did so poorly in the box office! 138 million?! that's it? Lord of the rings 3rd episode is at 350 million and still growing... now that had great ending.<br />Overall, it's a fine DVD but nothing special. I bought the first 2, but haven't bought this one. May one day buy it when it's on 50% sale just to complete the set, but not gonna pay them now since they totally disappointed me! <br />Alex,
B00005IC2H|5.0|This cd is amazing. Beautiful music accompanied by lilting Icelandish vocals. You have no idea what the lyrics even mean but you can't help but identify to some unknown feeling that sweeps down and grabs you by the heart and just wont let go until the songs are done. I haven't ever felt so moved by music in my life. Some people consider this rock or alternative, but to me it seems more ambient and lush to be categorized in those fields. If you can, buy everything this band makes. They are incredible.
B00000J7SO|4.0|This was a dylan album I had no interest in buying even when I tried to buy everything he owned. I had heard that it was strange and unfocused. I bought the full remastered set and this CD came with it. It was one of the last I listened to and I immediately disliked it. I returned to it a few weeks later and found it a little more managable, and now I quite like it from start to finish. <BR>I am typically pretty easy on Dylan, liking a lot of his lesser albums, but I do believe this is on par with Infidels and Oh Mercy, maybe even better. <BR>You just have to get past the strange arrangement on some songs and the awful backkup singers.<BR>I do believe this album has some of Dylans best singing.
0345452577|4.0|I read a few of the negative reviews before I got my hands on Conspiracy Club, and thankfully the bad reviews didn't spoil my fun.<br />First, I read one Kellerman novel several years ago so I had no opinions on this author when I got this book.  Even at 370 pages, this is a quick read.<br />Dr. Carrier is a pschyciatrist at a big city hospital.  His girlfriend has recently been murdered.  Dr. Authur Chess befriends him and at the same time Carrier begins receiving strange packages and notes leading him to clues about various killings and killers.<br />This book is from the point of view of Dr. Carrier.  It covers his relationships with his patients, coworkers and new girlfriend Angela.<br />The unique part of this book is there is absolutely no forshadowing or hint of what is to come.  You read about everthing as it happens to Dr. Carrier.  Nothing much happens in the book, but you do get to follow Dr. Carrier's journey as he is slowly lead on a path that could lead answers or more death.<br />The Conspiracy Club of the title not really part of the book, yet its existence does leave a few unanswered questions.  Those aren't really relevant to this review.<br />I enjoyed this book, and might actually give Kellerman's books another shot after not being impressed with his first one.
B0000TG9E2|3.0|I love this movie, and everything but there is a problem with the dvd on the second discs still gallery it stops and goes to the dvd screen saver. I bought this at Wal-mart and am planning on returning it, hopefully I just got a bad disc I did notice siginfigant scratches on the disc. This is just a warning to all the disney buffs out threre. However the disc one plays fine. I hope we don't have another Two Towers exteneded edtion dvd bug on our hands.
B0000035E7|5.0|Jeez, all these people complaining about how loud, crunchy, and repetitive the music is shouldn't listen to it. Good God, you guys wouldn't know a good album if Captain Beefheart and George Clinton personally whooped your lame Midwest asses with one. Loud, crunchy, repetitive - This is the point of the music. It isn't great art. Debut albums generally aren't. (Hey, if you want an example, listen to the Beatles' first album - better than 80% of the stuff you could ever get, but crap when compared to their later output). That being said, and I geniunely apologize for the obnoxious and puerile teenage rant occupying the first part of this review, &quot;Bleach&quot; is a very good debut album and a great launch pad. &quot;Blew&quot; is a mini-glimpse of how great Nirvana would turn out to be, kicking off the album with the nastiest bass riff in existence (or within my current viewpoint). &quot;About A Girl&quot; is the obvious candidate for a single, and it's a beautiful song, though it was better acoustic. &quot;Love Buzz&quot; is a great cover, howling with feedback and distortion while keeping great humor intact. &quot;Paper Cuts&quot;, &quot;Negative Creep&quot;, &quot;Scoff&quot;, &quot;Sifting&quot;, and &quot;Big Cheese&quot; are all great grunge riff-rockers too, though they get a bit monotonous due to the fact that Kurt Cobain wasn't such a great guitarist and didn't know that many chords. It is a marvelous start, which anticipates the future greatness.
0446530891|3.0|If David Baldacci had found a better way to conclude this book, I would have rated it much higher. As it is, I thought it was an interesting mystery. Two Secret Service agents are involved in a violent act being carried out against the people they were sworn to protect. One is assasinated. Sean King is the agent on that one. One is abducted. Michelle Maxwell is in charge of that one. Eight years seperates the two acts. Yet, the acts are linked and more people are about to die as the two agents start investigating the incidents and start turning up rocks that people don't want moved. There are numerous suprises and many things are not what they seem. I liked the book, but I did not love it. Maybe you want to wait for the paperback issue.
B00005JLEX|5.0|For all of the Seinfeld lovers out there, our day has finally  come. I have 9 VHS tapes of Seinfeld, that I taped while it aired, that are wearing thin. So, Seinfeld on DVD would be great! Plus there have to be hours of out-takes that we haven't seen. Please vote to release the series on DVD.
0385504209|5.0|One of the best page-turning thrillers I've ever read!  It really moves.  Can't wait for the movie!
B00004XQ83|5.0|You can't ignore the songs on this soundtrack. They are pieces of Americana. &quot;You are my sunshine,&quot; &quot;Angel Band,&quot; &quot;O Death&quot; and &quot;In the Jailhouse Now&quot; are gems from the american Music Lexicon. They will endure for a very long time. We generally don't take great pride in our rural past but the great gift of music breaks out of the human heart in all times and places and these songs are treasures. They certainly helped make &quot;O Brother&quot; the great movie that it was.
B0000UJL96|1.0|Just when you thought Paramount was coming around and being nice...they find a way to stick it to the ever faithful Star Trek fans who support the franchise and the undeserving pocketbooks of the Paramount executives.<br />After &quot;re&quot;-releasing all 5 movies in its &quot;special edition&quot; format after making the public buy all the movies in its regular &quot;no extras&quot; format, the executives in an effort to &quot;save costs&quot; decide to skimp out on the booklet.  Booklets which which accompanied the previous five special edition releases!<br />So after all that the executives manages to screw the loyal fans once again -- enough to make one FUME with rage.<br />That's not to down grade the movie -- which is exceptional due to Nick Meyer's direction.  Mr. Meyer, if you read this I hope you give the TIGHTWAD Paramount execs a piece of your mind on our behalf.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|I'll start off with a metaphor. If other movies are like diving in the pool, then Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation is like floating on your back and staring up at the sun. It's a movie that doesn't try to impress or even engage the viewer. It exists on its own lifeline, and if you're willing to tag along, you'll be rewarded with an engrossing and endearing experience. Notice I said \\"experience\\", because that's what the movie is. There are no heavy plotlines, there is not a lot of dialogue. There only exists two central characters who are lonely and isolated in a foreign country falling in love. There is no hidden message behind the lush visuals and beautiful performances by the actors. There is no knee slapping hilarity or tear jerking sad moments, there is only rich and heavy emotion...the kind of emotion that you aren't sure exactly what you're feeling. <br />Bill Murray stars as Bob Harris, a washed up actor who has been hired to endorse a Japanese whiskey company. Arriving in Tokyo to shoot some commercials, he is tired....of his job, of his life, and everyone around him. As fate would have it, Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) and her photographer husband are staying in the same hotel. Charlotte is a recent Yale graduate who is dissatisfied with her marriage and her direction in life. Meeting in the hotel bar, Bob and Charlotte slowly and gently fall in love, coming to terms with their own unhappiness with their lives. <br />Sofia Coppola would've been a great music video director. And this time (maybe the only time), I mean that as a compliment. The visuals focus in and out of eachother, slowly panning over the amazing Japanese landscapes, both in the city and the country side. Throughout a large portion of the movie, there is virtually no dialogue. Yet you're still captivated by the way Coppola takes you from scene to scene, most notably in the beginning as Charlotte wanders her way through Tokyo into the more rural landscapes. These scenes say something about Charlotte's character, both wide eyed and aware, noticing and all encompassing, and most of all....appreciative. It builds up a kind of sympathy from the viewer on Charlotte being married to her callous and rude husband, John. Yet Coppola shows her skill in being able to switch gears quickly, as Bob's storyline involves a lot more subtle and hilarious humor, mostly from Bill Murray. We should make a note that Murray could've easily botched this role (or been the sole bad mark on the whole movie). But give him credit for never even approaching the edge of comedic shtick. He remains sad and desperate, a man whose job is to be other people that he doesn't even remember who he is. For probably one of the first times in his career, the humor comes from the movie, and not from him. <br />I want to say one thing. Even without LOTR running against them, I doubt Lost in Translation would've even been given a second glance for Best Picture. It's just not that kind of movie. And once again, I have to stress how much credit Sofia Coppola should be given for not making it one of \\"those kind of movies\\", because she could have easily turned the star power and the fresh plot idea into a glitzy and heavier movie. But she keeps it gentle and subtle, which is obviously not for everyone. In fact, I heard the guy next to me completely doze off while watching it. And I could completely understand why. The movie is slow, it's deliberately slow. It's uninvolving, it's quiet, it's not a heart stopper in the least. But that's why it's so good. <br />It's virtually impossible to explain much more about the movie. If you haven't already seen it, you may just wait til Tuesday and see the DVD. But I strongly suggest to you that you see it in the theaters before it's gone from it's post-nomination run....seeing it in the theater makes it more enveloping. It's thick and dense and fills the room, and you may find yourself gently smiling to yourself in parts where absolutely nothing is happening.<br />I will leave you with this....another metaphor if you will. Lost in Translation is like the girl you're in love with, when she takes her hand and brushes your face. No kiss, no sex, nothing else. Just a small, simple touch. If you're a person who can find infinite happiness in an act like that, go run to see this movie. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, look for your money shot in any of the other movies out now. Along Came Polly maybe...<br />...but it's your loss.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Of course,this is a 5 star album all the way,I am just a kid looking for attention so I rated this 1 star(which was totally idiotic of me)...Sorry.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|I've read others reviews and im quite appalled!  How dare anyone state that alica is &quot;a complete fabrication of her label&quot;.  We'll just put it like this.. I personally know that she is no other working than her own.. she writes and sings and also produces the music that blesses the airwaves in this era of death.  Music is still hanging in there and no one has yet to pull the plug.  Ms. Keys is one of the few still breathing life into this sorry industry today.  Im sure that those who rate this as garbage are lost, because this CD is the farthest from garbage ive heard since her first release.  Being a diverse fan but a huge R&amp;B... she's exactly what is needed.  Clothes, a voice and talent.  Eat that britney and 50!
0446310786|5.0|To Kill A Mockingbird is a good book. Tom Robison was covicted of a crime in which he did not committ. the case was based on the unjustful opinion of the whites in the south during the 1930's. I like this book because it tells the truths of racist whites of the south.My closing statement is, this book was very enjoyable,when you read it, it gets very interesting.
B000069HK2|5.0|a friend reccomended the used to me, and a couple of weeks later i bought it. i was blown away, and was just about the only CD i listened to all of last summer. my three favorite songs in order are: blue and yellow, the taste of ink, and maybe memories. blue and yellow is soft, but serrated, and a song that plays in ur head when u see somthing truely beautiful. the taste of ink is a wonderful song, up beat, but with a dark side, kind of reminds me of sweet and sour candy. and maybe memories just makes u want to jump up and down or run, and experiance life and discover things. there is not a song on this CD i don't like, all of them are truely wonderful, and color ur life. it's one of those CDs that u never forget. even when i haven't listened to it for a while, i can still here the songs in my mind, just as clear as the first time i heard them, just like memories in ur mind. the songs never get old, and this CD will remain one of my all time favorites forever. if ur looking for a real life changing CD, buy Enchanced.
B000002OX5|5.0|The Who's third album, 1967's &quot;The Who Sell Out,&quot; was the band's very first concept album, the theme for the record being a pirate radio station that plays nothing but Who songs, complete with radio jingles &amp; commercials (some genuine, some created by the band) sprinkled inbetween the tunes. It's a brilliant, fabulously inventive, totally *psychedelic* Who album, and one of the band's all-time greats. The festivities kick off with a &quot;Monday Thru Sunday&quot; jingle, and then the band charge in with the far-out gem, &quot;Armenia City In The Sky,&quot; penned by guitarist Pete Townshend's chum John Keene, featuring elongated horns, psychedelic guitars, and a studio-tweaked vocal from Roger Daltrey. Pete Townshend's songwriting contributions to &quot;Sell Out&quot; are all gems, too, every single one of them: &quot;Mary Anne With The Shaky Hand,&quot; the hilarious &quot;Odorono,&quot; the coming-of-age tale &quot;Tattoo,&quot; the lovely &quot;Our Love Was,&quot; the legendary, explosive rocker &quot;I Can See For Miles&quot; (the Who's only US Top Ten hit), &quot;I Can't Reach You,&quot; &quot;Relax,&quot; &quot;Sunrise,&quot; and the mini-opera &quot;Rael&quot; (with it's instrumental bridge later resurrected as the &quot;Underture&quot; from &quot;Tommy&quot;), while bassist John Entwistle delivers the hilarious jingles for &quot;Heinz Baked Beans&quot; &amp; &quot;Medac,&quot; as well as the macbre-ish tune, &quot;Silas Stingy.&quot;But this remastered, expanded edition of &quot;Sell Out&quot; doesn't stop there: there's a whopping TEN bonus tracks of extra Who goodies recorded around the same time as the album. From Townshend's songwriting pen, there's the extended finale for &quot;Rael,&quot; &quot;Glittering Girl,&quot; the outstanding rocker &quot;Melancholia,&quot; the slick rock of &quot;Jaguar,&quot; an alternate version of &quot;Mary Anne With The Shaky Hand,&quot; and the brilliant finale, &quot;Glow Girl,&quot; which, like &quot;Rael,&quot; was later raided &amp; revised by Townshend for the &quot;Tommy&quot; album (&quot;It's a girl, Mrs. Walker, it's a girl&quot;). Also featured is Entwistle's &quot;Someone's Coming,&quot; drummer Keith Moon's charming little ditty, &quot;Girl's Eyes,&quot; and the fine popper &quot;Early Morning Cold Taxi&quot; (for which Daltrey received a rare co-writing credit). There's even a fabulous, barnburning, King Crimson-like rock arrangement of Greig's &quot;The Hall Of The Mountain King,&quot; plus more jingles. The musical chemistry of Daltrey, Townshend, Entwistle and Moon is nothing short of superb, and the remastered sound is simply incredible.&quot;The Who Sell Out&quot; was a natural lead-in for &quot;Tommy,&quot; as the album expanded Pete Townshend's interest in writing conceptual music. But it's also a mindblowing Who album all on it's own, one of the group's very best releases. So crank up &quot;The Who Sell Out,&quot; and enjoy rocking out with the Who's marvelous psychedelic radio show.
B0000UHFC6|3.0|I'll be brief and say that I consider the ROTK soundtrack to be the weakest when heard on its own.  Overall the music is better suited and appreciated when accompaning the film.  I don't consider it to be as outstanding or memorable as The Fellowship of the Ring or Two Towers soundtrack.
0792838068|4.0|When I heard that someone had finally made a movie based on the Cheryl Crow hit &quot;I'm Leaving Las Vegas&quot;, I knew I had to see it. I was certainly not disappointed. Nicolas Cage turned in his best performance since his role as stoner slacker Jeff Spicoli in &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot;. One important thing to note before you purchase this is that unlike his other Las Vegas movie, &quot;Honeymoon in Vegas&quot; where he dresses up like Elvis and skydives, this is not a comedy, unless you happen to think someone drinking themselves to death is funny. If you DO think self-destructive alcoholism is funny, then get ready to laugh your head off because that is what Nicolas Cage's character is all about. As he spirals towards his demise, he meets hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold Elizabeth Shoe who tries to save him from<BR>himself. I could go on but I don't want to ruin the movie for anyone who hasn't seen it. I missed 5 minutes out of the middle because I had to take an important call, but I had no problem catching up with the plot, so I guess that means the movie could have been edited a little better. The only thing that keeps me from giving this 5 stars is that the sound mix was a tad muddy for my ears, although most non-audiophiles probably won't notice.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is a gem of a series.  It's a fresh idea, built upon the idea of a western conversly set against future space travel.  It's such a great idea, and a shame that Firefly and the Anime title Cowboy Bebop don't get more viewer attention than they do.<br />I highly recommend this series and hope that once you view it, you will too.<br />Buy Firefly!<BR>Support Firefly!<BR>Save Firefly!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|IN THE ZONE is byfar the best album of 2003 it has a mix of hip hop all the way back to pop i think that if people would stop being so shady and give britney a try you will feel a hell of a lot better                                                           (* the best songs are*)i got the boom boom5/5,toxic5/5,outrageous4/5,the hook up 5/5and everytime5/5 everytime is realy cool because it means something, and if you listen to it you will love it .. if you don't have in the zone get itnow you'll be happy you did    .
B00006YXE4|5.0|Hello there, i'm gabriel and i'm a big fan of the good music.  I have to say that i love eric claton music, but through out the years, he has proved the world that he is an incredible musician. In this album, he assumes the role of the mature, experienced musician who involves everyone on the show.  Since the very first song, where he makes a solo, and then combining all the instruments in such a way that you don't realize, until all the sounds surround you and you can't tell who is playing what..  Songs like Badge, River of Tears, I want a little girl sound great with all the musical arrangements he made.  The all time favorite Wonderful Tonight, Layla, Bell Bottom Blues accuire such a magic tune, when all the croud supports the sond and besides is performed in such a great way.  This only proves that Clapton is just getting better and better every day, having more experience, adding the final touch to his songs and giving a great spectacle. <BR>This is a great album to know this great artist, it has the basic ones, and you can enjoy the great sounds, even on the last song Over the Rainbow on one of the best covers ever.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series could have been Joss' best--there are so many <BR>possibilities in the characters and what we can see of the<BR>beginnings of their arcs.  The writing, the ensemble cast, the <BR>production style, the effects, the ship itself, all are <BR>fantastic.  The DVD is in widescreen, too, so you can see it as <BR>the producers and directors intended it.  It is beautiful, and <BR>clunky, and riveting, just like a tin can in space.  And it is <BR>truthful about human emotion and experience in a way that few tv <BR>shows try to be.  <br />While I watched the DVDs, and especially the episodes that had<BR>remained unaired, I was overwhelmed with sadness that this<BR>series was killed by the ebil fox empire.  Why producers continue<BR>to work with Fox is beyond me.  They seem to buy up great <BR>material just so they can submarine it.<br />My only complaint about the DVDs themselves is the music<BR>they chose for the menus.  It really isn't moody and evocative<BR>enough.<br />If you haven't seen this DVD/series, buy it immediately.  You<BR>will want to watch it again and again.  And who knows, again,<BR>when the movie comes out.  We can only hope.
B000068QZK|2.0|It's a little surprising that Ozzy would choose to redo the drums and bass on his first two solo recordings, yet leave this release intact.  The drum sound on this recording is simply unacceptable, and the entire production is hopelessly murky, even after a remaster (clearly only AAD).  I hope whoever produced this record is no longer employed as a music professional. Poor Zakk Wylde hit the big time, only to have his debute butchered.<br />In terms of song writing, Ozzy was off to a weak start with Zakk.  Miracle Man and Tattoed Dancer are great songs, but the rest are as mundane as anything Jake E. Lee came up with on the Ultimate Sin.  Perhaps a few attempts to write with Zakk finally resulted in Ozzy's decision to hire other writers by the time of Ozzmosis.  It was really sound decision making, because Zakk is an amazing player, if not the most original writer, and it would be a shame to lose him.  He's as much a part of Ozzy's sound now as the legendary Randy Rhodes.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This CD is just amazing....I am glad to see that so many other people love it!
B000063DFS|2.0|Ozzy's second record with speed demon Zakk Wylde is another Ozzy recording ruined by bad production.  As I noted in my review of No Rest For The Wicked, it's a wonder that Ozzy would redo drums and bass on his first recording, yet leave Wicked and Tears unscathed.  Both are desperatly in need of new drums, or at least an ADD remastering.  The drums are a bit improved here, but still drenched in tinny echo.<br />Mr. Wylde's collaborative chemistry with Ozzy fails to improve on this outing, laden with more mundane metal.  I made a playlist of Ozzy/Wylde recordings, and it was a struggle to find four tunes from either Wicked or Tears to include.  No More Tears is one of Ozzy's best songs, however.
B00006EXL5|5.0|About a year ago, I had NO idea who My Chemical Romance was. Now, it's February 2004, and soon they have another album coming out. And the best part? Hardly anyone knows who MCR is. They're completely underground, which is the beauty of it. They may not stay anti-mainstream for long when their next album comes out, but that's not the point of this review.<br />The point is that My Chemical Romance is a breath of fresh air in a world of music that's hardly unique anymore. The lyrics are thought-provoking and make you feel emotions you thought were long dead. This album is a great reminder that good music still exists out there. Much praise for My Chemical Romance!<br />Personal Favorites: Demolition Love; Vampires Will Never Hurt You; and Drowing Lessons.
B00005M91K|5.0|Everything from Whirling dervishes to Snow Monkeys to chick Factories etc. There are three segments that are sinply amazing. The first where it shows people practicing the ancient religions, like the Wailing Wall, Islam, christianity etc. Then the another segment where it introduces Aborigines, Masai, and an Amazonian tribe and then cuts to the rituals or dance and song of all three. The third is of human suffering and claustophobia, where the suffocating urbanity of cities are shown along with the cruelty of chick factories, making comparisons, then a Japanese butoh preformer is shown in a silent scream of agony used in this film as a reaction o the bustling pointless and suffocation. It then cuts to the dumps in India where people scuttle around picking through garbage, it then goes to poverty and the homeless and lingers on the cold and dispassionate stares of Bangkok prostitutes, it then cuts to three Japanese Butoh Preformers who preform a slow and lingering and wavering dance of pain and anguish so beautifully done, with their chalky faces and clothes they look like they are in a trance, it then ends all the while using a beautiful and haunting score it then goes over endless planes and the burning fields of Kuwait, Nazi Death camp Auchwitz and the Cmbodian killing fields. This movie is amazing, it displays unity adn diversity. GEt it or see it in your theater, whatever just watch it man.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This CD never leaves my CD player, much less my backpack. I take it with me everywhere, because I never know when a Maynard craving will kick in. I love Maynard as a part of Tool, but even more, I love him as the lead vocalist of A Perfect Circle. You absolutely cannot go wrong upon purchasing this album. Maynard's voice is intoxicating, pure music to my ears.<br />Thirteenth Step takes you on a journey through a world you've prorbably never experienced before in your life. This CD is addictive, you will never want to put it down. It's a fantastic and completely amazing piece of work!<br />Personal Favorites: The Noose, Pet, and The Outsider.

B00003CX8I|3.0|World`s favorite mutants get their first movie and the result is convincing enough to deserve a watch. Bryan Singer, a repectable and innovative director (\\"The Usual Suspects\\", \\"Apt Pupil\\") shows enough respect and knowledge about the franchise and creates an entertaining and meaningful action movie, wich steps above many run-of-the-mill empty blockbusters with repeated ideas. The director expertly showcases the X-Universe, setting the mood and tone for the sequels to come. <BR>Although this is sci-fi material, in a way it`s depicted in a realistic, believable manner, as the characters and their envoironment seem credible and not too fantasy-like creations. Singer developed a serious tone for this universe, avoiding the childish and irritating tendencies of the latter Batman movies. The plot focuses mainly on Wolverine and Rogue, so unfortunately the rest of the characters aren`t too developed, but given that this is the first movie of a series it works well enough. <br />\\"X-Men\\" is intelligent, creative sci-fi, a solid movie with good direction, competent special effect (used just when necessary, avoiding useless explosions and fights), an efficient plot and a talented cast. Not a masterpiece, just a good comic-book adaptation (in fact, it`s probably one of the best). <BR>The ending result should please fans and non-fans alike, altough it would be surpassed by its sequel, \\"X2\\", a better and more sucessful movie. Worthwile entertainment (and though-provoking, too).
B0000A1RJI|5.0|In all of my movie-going days, I have never heard a better soundtrack. It is worth every cent I spent on it. If you liked the movie, you're guaranteed to love the music. I highly reccomend it.
B00005JM02|5.0|Finding Nemo, the best animated movie since 'Bugs' stikes a chord right from the get go and does not stop to look back.  Nemo, a lost fish in a big ocean, is swept around with a bunch of hijinks you will not soon forget.  This movie is a bit edgy for a 4 year old, but they will love it!  My niece was transfixed for a long time watching this film, and that is not an easy task.  So was I!  You will dig this movie.  B+
B00000G3PA|1.0|Easiest way to sum up this very, very bad film : it's a two-hour car commercial.    \\"Cue big, stupid flagwaving, cue big-budget stars, cue overpowering musical score!  All right, now explode stuff!  Now stick Aerosmith Ballad Format #3 in there!\\"  Voila!  Another gold-plated Bruckheimer poo.  Maybe one of these days we'll get a decent treatment of \\"Lucifer's Hammer\\" on the silver screen, but this is most definitely not it.    Ripped off a scene from \\"The Right Stuff\\", to boot.  I'm sure it was an \\"homage\\" or something, right?  Whatever.  The science is crap, so we really can't list this stinker as \\"science\\" fiction.  The cast of supporting characters is our usual colourful melange, all gleefully portrayed by solid character actors.  That's the only watchable thing about the film, and then it's only after you've had to kick aside the unease at some of the stereotyping.  It's syrupy, every plot point is telescoped a year in advance, Willis is just there to sell the mess, and BAffleck...proves once more that he's of limited use in movies that don't revolve around obscenity-spewing drug addicts (you know--Kevin Smith films).    Yes it made piles and piles of cash.  Goes to prove just how abysmally lacking in discretion, imagination, taste, and brains the movie-watching public is, don't it?
B00005JM02|5.0|I have to admit I had my doubts.  I'm not a fan of most Disney movies, I'm a grown woman who doen't have any kids, and I almost never watch child-oriented movies.  I was really pleasantly surprised!  The storyline is basically the adventures of a father fish (Marlin) and his new-found friend Dorie looking for his missing son (Nemo).  The movie has a lot of human emotion associated with looking for a missing child.  I can't believe this movie had me laughing out loud AND crying. The graphics alone are worth watching this movie.  I remember thinking about all the research that had to go into making the ocean, fish, and other sea life look so believable. It truly is visually stimulating--I looked forward to each and every scene.  I think this is a good movie for both kids and adults!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The hero of sci-fi, the man they call Joss, wrote a great story but got screwed by Fox.<BR>My girlfriend bought me this DVD set for my birthday. I had forgotten just how much I liked the series until I sat down and watched the first six episodes without stopping. I lost way too much sleep last week, and I still haven't seen the special features. I'm just glad the girl knows me better than I know myself.<BR>You can hate science fiction, and you can hate westerns (both of which I love), but it's impossible to hate the characters Whedon has created for Firefly. Each and every character has such a well-developed back-story that you can't help but find them all incredibly interesting. Combined with the wicked sense of humor possessed by the writing team, this made for some great television.<BR>This has been discussed by other reviewers already, but I would like to address what happened with the programming of the show. As with other popular shows that have been ruined by programming execs (think Titus), it's hard to get a following when viewers don't know from one week to the next when the show will air. On top of that, showing the pilot halfway through (or what wound up being the end of) the season tells me that the execs were never really committed to the show. Whedon is an established writer who is great at long-term plot development, and they should have gone with his sequencing. Instead, the network Foxed up everything from the get-go. That's okay, though. Ain't no power in the Verse can stop us from likin' Mal Reynolds and his crew.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Honestly, this has to be my favorite tv series EVER. It's just a shame that Fox didn't give it a chance, they crushed something really special. This show has great writing, wonderful plots, amazing special effects, and characters that you can really fall in love with. I can't imagine anyone not liking this show, even if they're not sci-fi or western fans. It's dramatic, funny, and totally unique. I recomend you buy this right now as not only will you recieve four discs of pure joy but every DVD bought helps the push to bring Firefly to the silver screen. Oh yeah, it's coming back. We hope.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Iron Maiden was my favorite band in the mid 1980s.  For the last decade or so, I lost interest and stop following the band.  The last albums I bought (with far less enthusiasm than before) were No Prayer for the Dying and Fear of the Dark. The last album I was excited about and still own is Seventh Son.  Even when Adrian Smith rejoined the band, I was no longer interested.  My view changed after reading reviews for Dance of Death.  Then I saw that one of the tracks is entitled &quot;Paschendale&quot; and, as someone who enjoys reading about WWI battles, I knew I had to check out this CD.  As you will guess from the grade above, I am glad I did.  This album has some of the best material I have heard from Maiden in over a decade.  <br />Some of the tracks are addicting.  I think I played &quot;Rainmaker&quot; a dozen times in a row.  It is Unbelievably catchy (I only wish there were more verses).  Other catchy tracks are &quot;New Frontier,&quot; which really rocks with killer bass, and &quot;Age of Innocence.&quot;  I can't help but hum along to the chorus of these tracks.  Iron Maiden's characteristic epics &quot;Dance of Death&quot; and &quot;Paschendale&quot; (each over 8 minutes) are amazing!  The lyrics to &quot;Paschendale&quot; are very moving and appropriate.  The booklet has glossy color photos of the band and separate photos of each band member.  I do not care for the cover artwork.  I think a Medieval woodcut of the Dance of the Dead (with Eddie, of course) would be cooler, but that is not what matters.  What does matter is that the music here is amazing with the usual expert Maiden musicianship and Bruce Dickinson's incredible vocals (check out &quot;No More Lies&quot;).  If you, like me, have not bought a Maiden CD in awhile, get Dance of Death!
0385504209|2.0|I just finished reading the Davinci Code. I liked it but ..it is badly written, very inaccurate history and a bit childish in it's overall structure. However, taken with a grain of salt , it was a very good read.<br />I wish the author had been a wee bit more careful about his research ,I found the glaring historical errors a bit off-putting. Still, the story of the Murder at the Louvre, the mystery of secret sects, the Vatican, Da Vinci and so  on is intriging and I found that in spite of the literary and historical medocrity of it all, I could not stop turning the pages. Surely that is the measure of any work of fiction..we keep turning the pages. A great Beach Book. Perhaps it will also serve the purpose of having people search out the true facts.
B00005221M|4.0|After reading many of the horrified reviews of the &quot;director's cut&quot; DVD version, one would expect a major chop job akin to what happened to Peckinpah's films in the 1970s, a major mutilation of a masterpiece.<BR>Calm down. It's nothing of the kind. Having been a fan of this film since its original release, and having watched the VHS version a couple of times a year since it came out, I had a hard time catching all the changes on the DVD, because most of them are so minor. Some are just a few seconds long. Some are improvements (the extended fort battle, the end of the surrender negotiations, the elimination of some trite and anachronistic wisecracks), others don't matter or are unfortunate (Chingachgook's speech at the end, the elimination of the Clannad song). Overall, especially if you are not intimately familiar with it, you are watching the same movie as on VHS.<BR>My only complaint is technical: The color and brightness are not especially well balanced; some shade or night scenes require adjusting your TV temporarily. And the absence of special features is disappointing.
B00006BTCA|4.0|Interpol reviews fall mainly into 2 categories. The 1st group despise the band because they are derivative of 80's post-punk.  The next group believe they are the best ever. The truth, as usual, falls somewhere in between.<br />If you listen without any bias you will discover an album of excellent songs; There is not a bad one on the CD. I have listened several times straight through and never wanted to skip anything. Also it's been a long time since a rock band created a sense of mood, atmosphere and anxious energy this well. On this basis the CD deserves at least 4 stars.<br />However, I bristle when people elevate Interpol to a best-ever type of status. The criticisms of the jaded crowd who call the band derivative are all absolutely true. Every one of these excellent songs recalls one or more songs that I've heard 20 years ago. This alone does not make them a bad band or TOTBL a bad album, but it does prevent me from giving it any better than 4 stars. Having solid sources of inspiration is not a crime and it's better than most groups are doing right now.<br />Now about those references, there are some good ones I've seen and some brutally inaccurate ones too. Joy Division - well duh, but the singer is not an Ian Curtis clone as some would have you believe, he just has very similar inflections and strains at times. Echo &amp; the Bunnymen - sure, ok. Kitchens of Distinction - clever comparison and on certain songs the music really is comparable, but in general Interpol is more somber and downbeat... calling TOTBL &quot;Strange Free World Part 2&quot; is way off-base. Psych Furs - clearly, but Interpol is less annoying. The Smiths - terrible comparison, show me 1 song in the Smiths entire collection that sounds remotely like any on this album... don't know where people dredged this idea up. The Church - perfect comparison, not sure why I haven't seen anyone else mention it... very similar in mood and songwriting style. The Cure - maybe but not directly. Chameleons- nice call. Bauhaus - not sure how no one has mentioned this either given that &quot;Say Hello To the Angels&quot; borrows the main riff directly from &quot;Third Uncle&quot;... also the sparse style and use of space is similar to many lesser known Bauhaus songs. And following that line to Love &amp; Rockets should also be clear. For 90's folk, the band also bears a strong resemblance to a less-upbeat Ned's Atomic Dustbin at times.
950491036X|5.0|Solo el titulo ya me sedujo. Ambientada en la posguerra espanola, La sombra del viento es, sobre todo, un homenaje a la fuerza de los libros, a la capacidad de la imaginacion para crear intrigas e inventar historias. Un thriller de los que enganchan, culto y popular a la vez.
B000005RMY|5.0|This album earns its 5 stars with its moments of excellence, its ability to show all sides of the early Sisters and by the sheer rarity of the songs contained. Be forewarned, they are not all gems and this is a poor place to start if you don't know the band in depth; start with Floodland, then get get FALAA, and then get this... you really don't ever need \\"Vision Thing\\" in my opinion but that's your call.  The centerpieces are \\"Alice\\" and \\"Temple of Love\\" with other standouts \\"Anaconda\\", \\"Adrenochrome\\", \\"Body Electric\\" and Floorshow\\" close behind. The Stones cover \\"Gimme Shelter is fantastic as is the Stooges (Iggy Pop) cover \\"1969\\" which seems like metal by comparison to the other tracks. After hearing the quality of these tracks you will be baffled as to how the band never managed to compile these into a debut album; It would have been as good as their others.  Equally baffling however is the exclusion of the \\"Body & Soul\\" single which would have fit the timing and quality perfectly; if you don't have that one you are missing something (ah, there's a reason we weenies collected all of those 12\\" vinyl singles after all). Given the '92 release date it would have been nice if certain later-period Sisters b-sides had been included. \\"Poison Door\\" and \\"Train\\" would be nice things to have on CD too but alas.  Maybe the coolest thing about this album though is the inclusion of the entire \\"Reptile House\\" EP. These songs are not as directly listenable as many of the other tracks but they offer the Sisters at their most somber and intimidating, surpassing even the Cure's \\"Pornography\\" on the dreaded darkness meter. If you thought that other Sisters was jet black to the center then you need to hear the \\"Kiss the Carpet\\" through \\"Burn\\" section of this disc. \\"Fix\\" is a straight shot to the bowels of your own personal hell. You'll also probably come to the rapid conclusion that Eldritch had a sinister, despairing battle with meth-amphetamine addiction, but then who didn't.  In summary, a great collection of the early material of a masterful band despite its minor misses.
0790729369|5.0|I couldnt stop watching.. I read the book first and found it so fasinating I couldnt put it down. The movie is just as good, it makes you feel like you were there.... I love this story...
B0000DD7LC|3.0|(3 1/2 stars)<br />Though I gave her first album a 4, Alicia Keys bypasses the sophomore jinx with this album (although so many people wanted to see her fail this time around). I liked \\"You Don't Know My Name\\" but it is so overplayed (like all of Alicia Keys' singles) that I just skip it while I play the album (moreover, the way she keeps saying, \\"baby, baby, ba-BY\\", starts to sound annoying). \\"If I Ain't Got You\\" is also a great song and \\"Diary\\" featuring Tony Toni Toné has great production. The promo song, \\"Streets of New York\\" featuring Nas and Rakim is supposed to be on here, but I'm glad it's not because the song is awful. There are also a few flaws like the \\"butchering a classic\\" moment, \\"If I Was Your Woman\\" over the Issac Hayes' \\"Walk On By\\" sample. At times self-indulgent, Alicia shows that she has talent, even though I don't know if it's worth all the praise that she's getting. Alicia's almost there: if she stops all that screaming and actually write some more mature songs, by album three she'll be ready for diva status. -EJR
B0000AQS0F|5.0|despite the poor treatment this show recieved from fox (broadcast in the worst possible time-slot for its demographic, episodes aired out of order), it was still a quality production from start to finish.  the setting was unusual, and one of the better conceived on tv, ESPECIALLY in that all of the details were not given exposition, they were simply presented and left, as in a real world history would not be explained to people who should, presumably, already know it.  the characters were developing nicely, to the extent that, as with whedon's other shows, a line written for one character and given to another was apparent.  when watching the episodes in order on the dvd, all of this becomes more apparent, as do the skills of the actors.  while firefly was not yet the best show on television, that was simply because it was not allowed the time to mature: when a show begins with this degree of writing, acting, and innovation, where can it not go?  of course, sadly for all those viewers who loved firefly, and all the unfortunates who would have loved it had they been able to watch it, we may never know (unless the movie does get made).  still, the dvd is one of the best out there, with interesting commentaries, extra scenes, and a gag reel.
B00004SZWB|4.0|No, this album isn't as great as Innervisions or Talking Book, but yes, it's still a classic. With one song that I can do without (&quot;Do Like You&quot;), this album shows that Stevie still had some tricks up his sleeve. &quot;I Ain't Gonna Stand For It&quot; is just plain catchy while &quot;Lately&quot; (later covered by Jodeci) brilliantly narrates a lover leaving her man for another. Of course I can't forget about the MLK, Jr. tribute &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; and the reggae-influenced &quot;Master Blaster (Jammin')&quot;, two hits that helped sell this album. This is the last of the great Stevie albums and Hotter Than July is definitely hot. -EJR

B00013PHGS|3.0|This is not so much a criticism of the album (which, in a nutshell, is loaded with great hooks and certainly their best since Moon Safari), but be warned that this CD will not play in some players.<br />I first listened to this on a boombox that was manufactured in 1997. No problems.<br />The second listen was on a Sony Walkman (model D-CJ506CK), one of the newish models that will allegedly play anything you can throw at it-- regular CDs, CD-Rs, CD-RWs, and CDs encoded with MP3s. I have never had a problem with this walkman, even while playing other so-called \\"enhanced\\" CDs. The Air disk, however, causes the player to endlessly spin and spin like it's searching for the audio files. I let the player search for those files on 2 occasions for about 5 minutes with no success. I attempted to get the disk to play at least 10 times while pressing various combinations of keys... to no avail. To confirm that there had not be a mechanical failure in the player itself, I tried other CDs & \\"enhanced\\" CDs, and they all played just fine. Theory: there's a software conflict between the enhanced junk on the CD and the software in the player.<br />The third listen was on a PC. The disk plays fine, though, as usual, I had to wade through the annoying \\"enhanced\\" features (it's only a friggin' screensaver displayed at 3 optional resolutions) before I was able to tell the computer to play the audio files on the disk in the CD-ROM tray.<br />How ironic, then, that the features on the CD which are designed to expand the user's experience (and the marketability of the music) are arguably at fault for me not being able to LISTEN to the music on a portable player. A word of advice to future CD creators: leave the extraneous junk on the band's website. Some of us still like to know that the product we have just purchased will play reliably across a range of devices.<br />I haven't even bothered with the DVD yet. I've been too busy trying to get the standard CD to play on my portable player (and the frustration of that experience was what has prompted this review). I plan to attempt to copy the audio files off the CD onto my harddrive and then burn a regular ol' CD that may play on the walkman.<br />I'll be interested to hear if other listeners are experiencing similar problems.
6304675348|5.0|In 1984, Wes Craven brought us the incredible A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. In 1996, he brought us the unbelievable hit SCREAM. Some horror fans look at this movie as a joke. When I look at those people, do you know what I see? @ssholes. This is an excellent piece of work, and very original.<br />  Drew Barrymore plays CASEY BECKER, who gets this weird phone call from an unknown guy. The unknown caller begins torturing CASEY and then kills her boyfriend, STEVEN ORTH, and just when you thought that Drew was going to be our leading lady who survives this whole ordeal, the unknown caller then kills her.<br />  Neve Campbell plays SIDNEY PRESCOTT. Sidney is our leading lady. The year before, Sidney's mother was brutally murdered. Sidney accused a man named COTTON WEARY. The next morning, Sidney arrives at school and notices the whole campus is full of police cars and reporters. Sidney's friend TATUM (played by Rose McGowan) tells her what had happened. After school, Sidney and Tatum are sitting on a bench with their boyfriends BILLY LOOMIS (played by Skeet Ulrich) and STU MACHER (played by Matthew Lillard) and their friend RANDY (played by Jamie Kennedy). They are talking about what kind of questions they were asked during their individual interregations and then they talk about their whereabouts the night before.<br />  That night, Sidney is planning to spend the night at Tatum's house. She gets a call from Tatum saying that she is on her way. She hangs up with Tatum and gets a call from the killer. The killer then comes in and attacks Sidney. The killer suddenly disappears, but her boyfriend Billy appears. She thinks he was the one who attacked her. Luckily, Tatum's older brother, DEWEY (played by David Arquette), who is cop, shows up to Sidney's rescue.<br />  The next day at school, the principal suspends every class due to everything that has been going on. Dewey arrives on campus and begins talking to ambitious reporter GALE WEATHERS (played by the beautiful Courteney Cox Arquette).<br />  That night, Suu throws a party. The party goes real well, until Billy shows up. He and Sidney get to talking and the two... you know... After they finish, Billy becomes the killer's next victim, sending Sidney running around looking for help. Gale and Dewey, run to the house. Dewey goes inside the empty house to check everything out, while Gale gets inside her news van to call the sherriff for backup, unaware that her cameraman had just bit the dust. Seeing her dead cameraman sends Gale crashing into a tree, leading to an ending that sets the stage for its stunning sequel, SCREAM 2.<br />  This is a movie that I have enjoyed for the past eight years (I still can't believe this movie is that old).

6305089957|5.0|In 1996, SCREAM became one of the biggest movies in the boxoffice records. Now, a year later, Wes Craven, director of the first film, comes back to bring this stunning sequel, SCREAM 2.        Maureen Evans (played by Jada Pinkett) and her boyfriend, Phil Stevens (played by Omar Epps) in line at the movie theater. The two have free passes to the movie theater. The movie is called STAB, a movie based on the events of the first film. They sit down as the opening of STAB begins. Maureen goes to get popcorn. While she is waiting for her popcorn, she overhears a girl saying that the movie was based on true events. She goes back inside the theater, while Phil goes to the bathroom only to bite the dust. The killer comes back, wearing Phil's brown leather jacket and then kills Maureen.         Sidney Prescott (again played by Neve Campbell) is now in her Freshman year of College. It has been a year since the events she suffered from her psychotic ex-boyfriend. Her roommate is Hallie McDaniel (played by Elise Neal), and is also Sidney's best friend. Sidney wakes up to get a call from a guy who wants to play a joke, but Sidney catches him with her Caller ID. She turns on the T.V. to find Cotton Weary (again played by Liev Schreiber) being interviewed about his release from jail. After that, the news reveals the murders of Maureen and Phil, where Sidney goes off to the Film Theory class to find Randy Meeks (again played by Jamie Kennedy), Sidney's friend from the last Scream. They talk about how someone hacked up the two kids in a ghostface costume, telling Sidney and Randy's life story. At that moment, Sidney's new boyfriend, Derek Feldman (played by Jerry O'Connell) arrives. The three walk off on to the main college campus with Hallie and Mickey Altieri (played by Timothy Olyphant), another one of Sidney's new friends. On the campus, there are hundreds of cops and news reporters. Speaking of news reporters, one of them turns out to be, the beautiful Gale Weathers (again played by Courteney Cox). There, she meets Joel Jones (played by Duane Martin), her new cameraman. After meeting Joel, Gale meets the chatty newswoman, Debbie Salt (played by Laurie Metcalf). A press conference is then being given by the Windsor Chief of Police, Chief Lewis Hartley (played by Lewis Arquette, David Arquette's father). There as Sidney and her friends watch, Sidney as a conversation with the sorotity Delta Lambda Zeta head sisters, Sister Lois (played by Rebecca Gayheart) and Sister Murphy (played by Portia de Rossi), where they invite the friends to their martini mixer that night. After, Sidney sees an old friend. That old friend turns out to be Dewey (again played by David Arquette). Seems Dewey has quit the police force and decided to rush down to Windsor for Sidney. They have a brief converstation which ends in Dewey informing Sidney that he'll be around to make sure she is safe. Her friends approach, as Gale Weathers approaches. Sidney is still very grateful towards Gale, since she helped Sidney in the last escapade. But Sidney feels anger towards Gale after she reunites her with Cotton Weary for an unauthorized interview, which leads Dewey and Gale to reunite in an angered conversation.        The DLZ sorority martini mixer has begun. Sidney and Hallie arrive, where they go and get themselves a couple of drinks with Sisters Lois and Murphy. At that moment, CiCi Cooper (played by Sarah Michelle Gellar) is sitting in her sorority house, Omega Beta Zeta. She has to stay there, in case someone from her soroity calls and is plastered. That is when she gets a call from the killer and is killed off. At the party, Sidney is having her ear chewed off by Lois and Murphy about having her join, but Sidney will not be joining. Derek sits down with Sidney and that moment, everyone finds out about the ruckus over Omega Beta Zeta. Everybody at the party goes to check it out, leaving Derek and Sidney at the front porch of the DLZ house. She goes to get her jacket andthen go home. While she is getting her jacket, the phone rings. She answers it. It's the killer, and Sidney again is attacked. Derek goes after the killer and end up with a cut arm.        Later in the day, Chief Hartley is talking to Dewey and Gale about the names of the three victims. He writes the names on the board, CiCi's name being last. Gale happens to ask if CiCi is the girl's real name. Chief Hartley reveals that CiCi is the girl's nickname, where Casey is her real name. Gale realizes that Casey Cooper is in reference to Casey Becker, from the first film. She then realizes that Phil Stevens is in reference to Steven Orth, Casey Becker's boyfriend, and that Maureen Evans is in reference to Maureen Prescott, Sidney's mother. Dewey and Gale realize that this killer is repeating Woodsboro. Chief Hartely reveals that Sidney is under the protection of his two best detectives, Detective Richards and Detective Andrews.        Sidney is now at drama rehearsal. The play is entitled, Cassandra, where Sidney is in the lead role of Cassandra. As she rehearses, she begins seeing the images of the killer's ghostface mask. She runs backstage, upset, where she tells Derek that she needs some space.        Later on, in the day, Randy bites the dust. While that is happening, Sidney has sort of an angered conversation with Cotton Weary, where he wants her to explain their side of the story on Diane Sawyer's show, but Sidney refuses, causing Cotton Weary to raise his voice in a publice library, where Sidney was talking to Cotton. Sidney and Hallie will be taken to a campus where they are kept in total safety. But while on the way, the two detectives and Hallie see the end of their lives.        Sidney runs back to the college auditorium, where she sees Derek chained up to a stage prop. He was kind of tortured by his Frat brothers of the Omega Kappa Beta, since Derek gave up his Greek Letters charm to Sidney. She wakes Derek up, only as the killer approaches and kills Derek. Who is the killer this time? The only way to find out is to watch Scream 2 and prepare to Scream a second time.
B00005JMGL|5.0|What an INCREDIBLE movie!! Wonderfully written, directed and acted.  The effectsmake Neverland unbelievable yet quite real - a true (gorgeous) fantasy land. The young actors were superb, never campy or saccharine rot-your-teeth sweet.  These are characters that youngsters can easily relate to, but also relatable to all adults who felt these feelings.  The immensly talanted and oh so very very handsome JASON ISAACS plays one of the best movie villians ever.  He plays James Hook exquisitely;  dangerous, dark, brooding, yet with golden glimmers of what this man could have been;(the man Peter would become if he grew up); with a subtle sexual edge that understandably entrances Wendy.  Mr. Isaacs is also wonderful as Wendy's father, George Darling. Excellent ensemble acting, Mrs Darling was wonderful, as was the aunt (new character).This is a movie for all ages and backgrounds - it stays close to the novel by Mr. Barrie, yet when it strays, it's an improvement. No bad things to say about this film!
B0000DYJM6|4.0|This is a must have for all devout Pearl Jam fans!  <br />This album has all the favorite b-sides and rarities from the past and some new precious &quot;gems&quot;, like Fatal. <br />This album is simply amazing! <br />I can spend hours drinking beer and listening to it!
B00005JLR6|5.0|Beautiful, compelling and poetic.  The Bolger sisters and Samantha Morton shine in one of the best films of this year.  Djimon Honsou's awesome performance in the role of \\"Mateo\\" deserves the oscar for best supporting actor.  The only real flaw with the film is that there are a few scenes of oversentimentality that don't entirely work (i.e. the early scenes involving E.T. although they do somewhat payoff in the end of the film) and some of Paddy Considine's acting is suspect in certain scenes at the beginning.  Also what's with the girl's having that digital video camera when this is supposed to take place in the early eighties I believe (i.e. E.T. showing and dolls conveniently being found at the amusement park/area)? But overall this is a film full of memorable scenes, great music and cinemtography and one of the very best endings I have ever seen.  The power of the ending alone gets this one a five star rating.  Look beyond its flaws if you can.  There are many rewards in giving this film a chance.  It should have been nominated for Best Picture instead of Lost In Translation.
B000062X90|5.0|I've had 2 vinyl copies in the last 25 years and the current one has held up well.  I resisted an earlier CD because I could not reconcile having 'No Easy Road' as a bonus track as I felt it hampered the concept of Argus.  The crisp clear guitars, driving bass and sharp drums on this remastered CD really demonstrates the poor quality of the original vinyl although I never noticed this before.      The three 'Live from Memphis' cuts are raw and exciting and complement the main album.  My original album cover does have something that the CD cover does not-the flying saucer. This is strange because they reference the fs in the CD booklet.  Wishbone Ash still tours extensively and returns to the U.S.   February 2004.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Amnesiac began life as an album born out of the \\"Kid A\\" sessions, whereby it was seemingly completed alongside those difficult sessions.  And as Radiohead have always been a band that is Always looking to push the Boundaries of Experimentalism, Radiohead were faced with a tough decision for their creation of the albums born from these sessions: \\"Do they stick to the avant-garde emotive guitar-riffs that has characterised Radiohead throughout the 90's???\\" or \\"break away completely...from their established sound, and re-invented their music???\\"  <br />Thus having decided to turn their backs on everyone's expectations and go with Re-inventing their music \\"Kid A\\" & \\"Amnesiac\\" were born. <br /> <br />More than anything else this an Electronic album....with the band having to \\"Re-Learn\\" how to play their instruments (or indeed, learn to play completely different instruments,)....whether it's the superbly disconcerting haunting beauty of \\"Pyramid Song\\", or the skittery styled almost drum N Bass of \\"Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors\\", or how about taking Thom's vocal on \\"You and whose army?\\", electronically modifying it, and pushing it into a completely different direction, and pushing the instrumentation to the forefront, whereby the vocal is largely in the background. \\"I might be wrong\\" has the tension of something closer to the Alternative-rock sound that they originally started out as, in the bands early days.  \\"Knives Out \\" is arguably the best known track on here, and a stable of the bands live performances, and most notably one of the more conventional sounding tracks on here, but strangely one of the most memorable, due to it's more accessible immediacy.  Amnesiac is a album where the tone is set for morbid reflection, dredging up your deepest anxieties from where you thought they'd lain at peace, this is most definitely an album to doesn't initially pay off after the first listen...and requires multiple listen to enjoy it's intricacies, gradually unfolding and revelling previously unrecognised depth and subtleties.  In fact there's a high chance that you'll be highly disappointed with it (unless you frequently listen to Electronica/IDM and are used to incredibly layered music, that unearths new sounds & instrumental sound on repeated listens)...but perseverance and a willingness to engage the music, will revel that with each listen generates something new, that was missed upon the first few listens, something gradually magical in it's structure, something resembling misinterpreted genius.....listen to the second track \\"Pyramid Song\\", a truly slight song, and poignant mood..that for me, makes not only one of the finest tracks on the album, but possibly one of my all-time favourite Radiohead songs.  Amnesiac wont convince everyone of its merits, and some it find its glacial mood and brooding insular sounds distracting, and there will undoubtedly be those that find this all incredibly pretentious.  But those willing to accept the bands shift away from their conventional rock-based sound, for this largely electronic direction, will find one of 2001's most astonishing releases. <br />
B000000HHE|5.0|On this album, De la Soul was doing stuff most others weren't doing for a good 10 years or so.  It was melodic rap with intelligent, poetic lyrics in the era of gangsta rap.  The guys in DLS took heaps of craps for being sell-outs because white college kids were listening to their albums.  However, this album will outlive the stuff put out by hip-hoppers who were in favor in the late 80s but fell out of favor not long after.  This is a must-have, even for those who don't consider themselves to be rap or hip-hop fans.
B000024D4R|5.0|This album veers away from the 'Space Rock' style of music that characterised many pink Floyd albums, and explored the frequently overlooked darker side of Blues-Rock. Generally darker and more complex to listen to in comparison to something like \\"Dark side of the moon\\"......the mood is one of bleak cynicism &amp; a Eerie underlying dark mood that subtlety reveals itself further on into the album. (It could indeed be even argued that the album reveals it's true bleakness, after repeated listens), but as Pink Floyd are experts in constructing textured soundscapes &amp; emotions, that defy conventional means. Surging guitars play out the theatrics, with `Roger Waters' fractured vocals providing the perfect accompaniment, although this is not the best starting point for people new to the whole `Pink Floyd phenomena' (it's a bit too inaccessible for that, &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; is a more accessible starting point!!), But fans that have \\"Meddle\\", \\"The piper at the gates of dawn\\" &amp; \\"Wish you were here\\" would be well advised to check this out.
0385504209|5.0|Bottom line is, this book was a great read, I enjoyed it immensely and whether or not it is a truthful portrayal of Opus Dei or Mary Magdalene isn't really important.  It's just a book, take it as it is and enjoy it for what it is.

So strong and clear and john is just playing from the heart. The way the band shows their love for their music is something wonderful to watch. You can just tell that they really love what the are doing and the crowd is amazing.
0060194995|5.0|To kill a Mockingbird is a book based on the time period of the 1930's. It tells the truth behind the walls of lies. The characters are perfect for a child's view of racism, growing up, and the ways of life. The book is set in Maycomb, Alabama in the poor area for the whites. In this town blacks are treatd fairly by some and unrighteously by others who feel they have a overbearing  superiority . White women had meetings in which they gossiped about blacks. The town in my opinion is too close and  they tend to know people all to well. They pass so much judgement that some tell lies that are not intended to benefit them just so they can be left alone. In my closing statement I say, &quot; This book is a great depiction of the unjustful ways of the 1930's.&quot;<BR>- Jasmine Meriwether

0312319517|5.0|I am a big fan of Mr. Forsyth and have read most of his books. &quot;Avenger&quot; is typical of Forsyth's style with an intriguing plot and a mixture of fiction and facts. At times there is a good deal of exposition providing background or explanations of what is happening in the novel. In other books the author has provided somewhat more than is needed and has indeed bogged down the story with very great detail of procedures used in the plot. &quot;Dogs of War&quot; comes to mind because there was enough details about illegal gun running to be boring and distract from the plot. However the &quot;Avenger&quot; was well balanced, with some very interesting facts(?) provided about the CIA, FBI, counterterroism, Vietnam and the Bosnian war.<br />It is a fast moving story and a quick read. The protaganist is nearly believable, but not as outlandish as some action heros. It is worth reading just for some of the author's insights. I recommend this book to any fan of Frederick Forsyth or who likes an exciting action/adventure story.
B00005Y1TL|5.0|Although not strictly an Ambient Album, this is definitely a much quieter affair than `Richard D. James', usual eclectic offerings. By mixing elements of minimalist techno, with traces of Electronic ambient.....this feels more at home, as an Electronica Album, rather than the subtle soundscapes of true ambience. Nevertheless, this is ultimately a superior Electronica album, as there is something here for any fan of intelligent Electronic music. True!!, the album does start with the first couple of tracks such as: \\"Xtal\\" &amp; \\"Tha\\", taking their cue from genuine ambient craftsmanship, and halfway through the album slight elements of minimalist techno are introduced, but by the time the Jaw dropping \\"Ptolemy\\" has wandered into the your subconscious......the changeover from minimal techno through to Electronica has firmly taken place. \\"Selected Ambient Works 85-92\\", has too much of a club-orientated bass-line to be an authentic ambient album, but Judged on this work alone!! Richard D. James's, TRUE craftsmanship, ISN'T in his usual genre of `Experimental / idiosyncratic' Techno.
B00005JME0|4.0|I think that the butterfly effect was a good movie! Although Ashton really isn't known for dramatic roles, he still does a great job. If you get queasy easy, then this isn't the movie for you. There is a lot of blood but most of it is just for a few seconds..nose bleeds and such! All in all, a good movie to see in theaters that shall be added to my movie collection shortly.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|In Donnie Darko, I am vaguely reminded of the question put to the test in The Seventh Sign, where Demi Moore is asked, \\"Would you die for him?\\"<br />She doesn't understand the question until the ending.  In a way, I compare Donnie's dream, or alternate reality, to this question:  \\"Would you die for love?\\"<br />It also brings about another question, \\"Is it better to have loved and lost, then never to have loved at all?\\"<br />Donnie is odd, Donnie is strange; but Donnie is a likeable kid despite his problems.  He is on medication for troubles he has had in the past, and is struggling to \\"just be normal\\".  He meets a girl named Gretchen, and they find their first love; and it will be a never-ending love.  Gretchen has problems of her own, with her mother having to hide from a violent ex-husband.<br />The movie starts with Donnie waking up in the middle of the street, in the hills above his home.  He brushes himself off and heads home only to discover that a plane engine fell out of the sky from nowhere and struck his room.  If Donnie did not suffer from somnambulism he would have been killed.<br />Donnie does have friends at school, but he also has imaginary companions whom he speaks with, and as he tells his therapist, they sometimes tell him to do things.  Enter Frank, the large psycho looking bunny who tells Donnie that the world will end in 28 days.<br />Basically, the movie follows Donnie for these 28 days, through school and therapy and home, bringing in some very interesting characters like Grandma Death, and of course Frank; along with great small roles by Drew Barrymore as the teacher and Patrick Swayze as the self-help guru who doesn't make any sense.  You will love the scene where Donnie attends one of his seminars.<br />It's rather hard to do a review of this movie without giving away any key information, and I urge you not to read any review that offers spoilers.  This is a movie that should be watched without knowing, so that all the emotions it provokes come from inside you and not some reviewer or friend.<br />The ending is very surprising, and left me with a question that will not spoil the movie for you;  did Donnie make the choice, or was the choice made for him?<br />Your view of this movie will definitely be your very own, but I can guarantee that whether you love it or hate it, you will not walk away unscathed.<br />It is both dark and enlightening, surreal and yet realistic, and definitely thought provoking.  If you have been trying to decide whether or not to rent it, my advise is just do it and judge it for yourself.<br />Enjoy!come from inside you and not some reviewer or friend.<br />The ending is very surprising, and left me with a question that will not spoil the movie for you;  did Donnie make the choice, or was the choice made for him?  <BR>Your view of this movie will definitely be your very own, but I can guarantee that whether you love it or hate it, you will not walk away unscathed.<br />It is both dark and enlightening, surreal and yet realistic, and definitely thought provoking.

B0000VAFO0|3.0|&quot;Underworld&quot; was marketed as a Romeo and Juliet story within horror elements of werewolves and vampires. The romance between the vampire (Kate Beckinsale - great in latex!) and would-be werewolf, or rather &quot;Lycan&quot; (Scott Speedman) is nearly nonexistent save for a few kisses and lingering stares.<br />The story is really a series of extended action sequences and the inner politics and scheming of the vampire elite and hunted lycans. I actually some of the plot ideas intriguing, with the racial homogeneity issues, and the history between the various characters such as Viktor (one of the vampire elders), Lucien (leader of the lycans presumed dead for centuries but conducting nasty bio-tech like experiments) and Kraven (the vampire who allegedly killed Lucien and now leads the coven, but has some shady dealings...)<br />Beckinsale as the assassin Seline is the most &quot;human&quot; of the groups, and her conscience leads her to some startling discoveries as she attempts to save Michael Corvin (Speedman) from both the vampires and the lycans.<br />The cinematography is effectively dark and gothic, with the Hungarian buildings, constant darkness and rain, and blue and gray lighting effects. The ending has a satisfying conclusion, while leaving us with a tease that there will be a sequel.
B0000DYJM6|3.0|First, I must say that I'm glad that Pearl Jam's finally realeased some of their best songs (&quot;Fatal,&quot; &quot;Sad,&quot; &quot;Hold On,&quot; &quot;Strangest Tribe,&quot; &quot;Education,&quot; and many more) to the general public as well as made most of their B-Sides easier to find and own in a legitimate manner. However, there are some major problems with this release. Of all the 31 songs on here, about half are of good to excellent quality and the other half are total throwaways. As mentioned by another reviewer, most of the &quot;throwaway&quot; songs seem to lack the depth and passion that I've come to almost take for granted coming from Pearl Jam. This makes this release VERY inconsistant, especially the first disc. Although the second disc has some clunkers on it, it does flow smoothly, which I at least respect. <br />My other gripe is the fact that &quot;Leatherman,&quot; &quot;I Got Id,&quot; &quot;Long Road,' &quot;Breath,&quot; and &quot;State of Love and Trust&quot; ALL weren't included. This comes as a major shock because all of those songs are definate &quot;classics&quot; and actually get played live much more than the majority of album tracks. Maybe the band figured that they were available enough to the public as is, seeing as iTunes has mulitible live versions of each of these readily available, as well as the studio recordings of &quot;State of Love and Trust&quot; and &quot;Breath.&quot; However, it would both make the album better and help out new PJ fans if they were on Lost Dogs. <br />Now for the real question that I'm sure most of you are asking: &quot;Should I buy this or not?&quot; It really depends. If you're obsessed with Pearl Jam and have all their other CD's (and maybe a bootleg or two), then you should get this as soon as possible because you're guarenteed to find at least ten songs you like on here, if not more.  If you want to save money or are new to Pearl Jam, then either don't buy this at all, or buy the best songs on iTunes. To find out what songs to buy, just look at the tracklistings of a few bootlegs; the best songs on here are more often than not live staples, although there are certainly exceptions (such as the songs I listed in the first paragraph). <br />This easily could have been the best CD released in 2003 if only Pearl Jam had edited it a bit.

B000094J5T|5.0|I have never in my life been so affected by a film.  I was forced to watch it over a period of several weeks as it was difficult to digest the horror &amp; apathy all in one sitting.  How any group of people could degenerate to this level and the world turn a blind eye for so long is beyond comprehension. I was able to put aside the initial hate &amp; disgust and see this masterpiece of filmaking through the eyes of one man's family. From this I have developed an entirely different view of &quot;isolationism&quot; and would recommend it highly to anywone interested in world history.
0380789019|4.0|This is my favorite Neil Gaiman book.  Although at some points it's hard to follow, overall the story grabs your attention and keeps you from putting the book down until you are done.
B0000AMJED|4.0|I am &quot;NOT&quot; a MTV person, or a Vin Desil triple X fanatic...but I can honestly say that this sequel is a very good movie.<br />I hated part 1, so I was very surprised by enjoying this movie. The sepecil effects are better!!!! And the racing scenes seem more realistic.<br />If you like fast cars, then you should buy this DVD.
0136879721|5.0|Im sure everyone has a bible. What you need on top of that is Think and Grow Rich, and this book.<BR>  This book has the most how-to than any book i've ever read.<BR>Think and grow rich has the formula to get rich, but is vague on how exactly to use the formula.<BR>  Thats why this book is a must-have. The author breaks it down so readable and within a few chapters you are able to apply some techniques. It really taught me how to use my mind to talk to myself. <BR> I got results after only a couple days.
B00005Y228|4.0|Her 2nd best album in my opinion, sounds a bit cold on first listen, but is filled with great singles and great fillers.<br />From the classic Cant Get You Out of My Head, to Love at First Sight, the great Come Into My World and the even better dance single In Your Eyes.<br />This album has a couple of gorgeous pop ballads, especially Fragile, which is kylie at her best. <br />A great album, but consider the double cd version available on import - with the additional remixes (notably Cant Get Blue Monday Out of My Head, and the Fischerspooner remix of Come Into My World) and a passable new song (originally on the Scooby Doo Soundtrack).<BR>The only track missing, is 'Tightrope' which was released on the international versions of this edition - its perhaps Kylies best song ever, and a crime it was missed off here.<br />Not camp like Light Years, this is more mainstream, appealing more to the general populous rather than girls and gay guys (like its predecessor).
B00004X01U|4.0|this is a very good album, the third best madonna has realeased. the first being \\"Madonna\\" i will grade each song on a 1 to 10 scale.<br />(Music)10/10. this song far outshines ray of light in every way it's smmoth electronic beats make you wanna \\"dance with your baby\\"<br />impressive instant.8/10 the fast pace of this song with it's electronic sound makes it's horrible lyrics work suprisingly well with the beat.<br />runaway lover. 8/10 A techno song that has a addicting electronic beat<br />4. i deserve it. 9/10 a very good song. it makes you wan't to dance with it's country sounding lyrics.<br />5. amazing. 10/10 a very good song with a sixteis sounding beat.<br />6. nobody's perfect 7/10. not my favorite, though this is still a standout and a very good balla/techno song<br />7. don't tell me. 10/10 the best song on the album. it's mixture of pop and country works quite well.<br />8. what it fees like for a girl. 10/10 very good the 3rd best on the album.<br />9.

B000062YAZ|5.0|This album can peel the paint off walls. Buy this CD!! If you want to feel the most powerful fast and aggresive music in the world this is the cd. Reign in blood is the best CD that you can own. I swear buy this. you wont regret it. And then buy every slayer cd. Unless you cant handle it.
B0000BWVCJ|4.0|A couple of characters from the good guys, and the bad guys get killed in this movie. <br />It's a lot better than part 1. The fighting skills of all the characters seemed to have improved tremendously. Wolverine himself kills about 10 soldiers who break into the school for the mutants. This is a big improvement on his character because in part 1, they made his fight scenes seem very weak.<br />This movie is also better than the Spiderman movie.
B00005JJX8|3.0|You could be forgiven if you thought you were watching a well filmed travel tourist marketing film on the beauty of Cannes, and in VISTA VISION, or a tribute to Edith Head with the emphasis on costumes, which is part of Hitchcock's game in the film about appearances, masks, lies, etc.  The dialogue is reasonably witty, and yes, Mr Grant and Ms Kelly, look &quot;good&quot; in that lacquered, phoney,  fifties Hollywood style.  There's no question that the film, rich in colour, crystal clear, and glossy is well made.  But beneath the gloss, it's a gossamer thin story with little suspense.
0345350499|5.0|I have always wanted to read this book, but I was intimidated by the sheer length of it. Besides, I knew nothing about King Arthur or the Round Table and didn't particularly care for action-focused books. Thankfully, none of that mattered. &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; is about the women of the court, so it's not about about battle strategy, political intrigue, etc (sorry, guys!). But that's not to say that this is a dull-witted romance novel. I learned more about Dark Ages Britain than I'd ever learn in any history course. <BR>     This is possibly the most moving book I have ever read. Marion Zimmer Bradley is phenomenally talented, and it's easy to see that a great deal of research went into the writing of it. There are easily a hundred or more characters, major and minor, some with unpronouncable or very similar names (Uwaine, Gawaine, Gawan) And somehow they all seem to have their own personalities. <BR>     There are four parts to the book, &quot;Mistress of Magic,&quot; dealing mainly with the life of Igraine and the training of Morgaine of the Fairies as priestess; &quot;The High Queen,&quot; which is about Queen Gwenhwyfar and her life and influence on King Arthur; &quot;The King Stag,&quot; where most of the novel's plotting takes place; and &quot;The Prisoner in the Oak,&quot; where all that Morgaine, Viviane, and Kevin have wrought comes to fruit.<BR>     Though it takes a long time, and plenty of patience, to read, the end result is well worth it. I am sure that i will remember &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; for years, and may even read it again someday. Highly recommended!
B00009TB5G|5.0|for Ethan or &quot;The Quest&quot; reviewer, whoever u are, i think u're the one who's dateless coz u can write stuff like that, in Old English whatever..albeit u are a geek! And chicks dig LOTR, dude!
B0000U0X1G|4.0|This isn't the kind of movie where the cops paint the walls with blood ( unfortunately ). <br />There are a few nice action scenes, but nothing that will make you jump out of your seat. <br />I guess this is a good movie to buy if you want some motivation to join the police force.
B000007ODM|3.0|This album is a clear example of an artist who exhibits great potential but unfortunately runs into an early dead end.  Most of the stuff is pretty generic, with each track running the risk of sounding alike and meshing together into one indistinguishable mass.  The first two tracks (Ameno and Cathar Rhythm) are quite excellent, and give a glimpse into what could have been.  But once past the glitz, the rest are uninspired at best.  The worst comes from the introduction of a very annoying electric guitar, complete with utterly stereotypical guitar solos that do little other than break up the haunting rhythm of the chants and reduce them into nothing more than some weird new-age metal.  This isn't creative.  It's merely pretentious.  It's like the artist have run out of ideas and is just throwing every possible sound together, like tossing random instruments into a blender and hoping for something original.  The result is an album with a couple good tracks and a bunch of boring filler.  Full of potential, but ultimately disappointing.
B000000OQF|5.0|One of the greatest metal albums of all time, a listener can hear the influence of Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot; is a great song with great performances all around, you can hear the heavy influence from Led Zeppelin's &quot;Immigrant Song.&quot; &quot;Mr. Brownstone&quot; is about the band's addiction problems and is only OK at first, but has a catchy sound to it. &quot;Paradise City&quot; sounds great with excellent guitar riffs to spearhead the song. &quot;Think About You&quot; is pretty good while &quot;Sweet Child O' Mine&quot; is the song that propelled Guns N' Roses into mainstream metal. It starts out okay, but Slash's work with the wah-wah petal is what separates this song. The only downside to this album is that there are too many filler songs (All of the filler songs are filled with obsenities so they are easy to tell apart).
B00006LLNU|4.0|That's just one of the ways to describe this album.  Ambient, ethereal, symphonic, moody and brilliant would be some of the others.<br />The album is basically a 8-track 71-minute instrumental, with vocals used as an instrument, rather than for lyrics.  (There are words in the tracks but it is hard to discern what the exact words are - probably something in Icelandic.).  The music is most similar to Radiohead's \\"OK Computer\\" (surely one of the greatest albums ever, so no small plug) - progressive multi-instrumental symphonic rock, with a shimmering, enveloping every-note-is-valuable feel.<br />Ideal for when you're feeling mellow, or just need something to let your spirit float upon.
157492589X|5.0|We just purchased the VHS tape of Lonesome Dove (from Amazon)but have yet to open the package. I realize the TV movie was 8 hours long and that without commercials the running time was down to 6 hours. However, the tape we purchased says running time is 4 hours. I'd appreciate if anyone who has viewed the VHS tape could<BR>tell me it's actual running time and /or if any scenes have been removed.  Many thanks.<br />Oh yea, the movie. Best and most memorable movie my wife or I have ever seen. Never get tired of watching it.
B00007KWHP|5.0|Fragile was not the first rock album i had, but was the first one i bought with my own money. Hardly earned and saved when i was 12y.o. :-). Needless to say that this was love at fist sight.. Fragile might not be my favorite (it is GFTO), or the one i consider the best (CTTE), but it has touched me and will always be on my top album list. I can say i know all the lyrics and melodies from memory.. from time to time i caught myself singing Heart of Sunrise or Roundabout or South side of the sky. Buy the remaster edition, as the bonus songs are worth it!
B000051VWW|5.0|this cd is probably my favorite since &quot;stronger than pride&quot;.  not only does sade have an amazing voice, but her songs also have great lyrics.  i love this cd.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|One of the most moving movies I have ever seen, right up there with modern classics like \\"Paris, Texas\\" and \\"American Beauty\\".  A story of two people far from home in a foreign country, with a vastly different pace and way of life to what they're accustomed, and how their friendship gets them through the confusion and loneliness.<br />A movie I intend to see many times.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|I've lived in \\"foreign\\" lands all my life. There is no excuse for Hollywood Romantic \\"interludes\\".  I followed my wedding vows - I felt they were important, thus didn't like the whining and the \\" feel good \\" aspects of the story line. Both protagonists were despicable to me.  I am a reasonable man, but dislike the tone of \\"rationality\\" which seems to permiate our culture - especially in this film, which was not funny in the least.
B00007LTIC|5.0|This is one of my favorites from YES, with, perhaps, my all time favorite from the group: Turn of the Century. Also, the church organ played by Wakeman on Parallels is outstanding!<br />This album is sometimes underrated by fans, if compared with CTTE or Fragile, but is one of the most beautiful works of the group.
B000002KFJ|5.0|What can i say except..AMAZING. Sabbath are such a legendary band, they opened so many doors and influenced so many bands through out their run and even still today. I know that Iommi is one of my faovrite guitarists out there, his riffs are just so heavy, he just bangs the hell out of the guitar. He is one of my biggest musical influences.<br />But anyway, Sabatoge in my opinion is so amazing because Ozzys voice is just more wailier on this album. Along with the first album. No one can match his voice. The singing on &quot;Hole in the Sky&quot; and &quot;Megalomania&quot; just sends chills up my back everytime. Great lyrics as well, just read along   to &quot;Megalomania&quot;, you will be amazed. The tracks:<br />Hole in The Sky (10/10)- Its just epic, for an opener to the album you listen to it and think &quot;Good god! If this is just the first song the whole album must be amazing!&quot; and it is. Tonys guitar is just massive.<br />Don't StartToo Late(7/10)-The acoustic work is very relaxing and easy to listen to, just a quick instrumental song that leads into Symptom of The Universe.<br />Symptom of The Universe(10/10)- The guitar riff in this song is the epitome of what Hard Rock should sound like. Iommis fills and harmonies are amazing, with the massive pumping bass of Geezer Butler in the back. Just an amazing, hard rocking song. Ozzys yell is quite the yell as well.<br />Megalomania(10/10)- Wow, this is one helluva powerful song.Ozzys voice on this track just gives me this feeling each time i listen to it. And the acoustic guitar behind the main riff of the electric works so well. And then the drums come in and Iommi just balls to the wall plays this massive riff. Amazing song.<br />Thrill of It All(8/10)- This is a good track,not spectacular but the guitar riff and drums in it are the only thing really special about it. Iommi does these double stop riffs which are just awosme. Overall good track.<br />Supertzar(6/10)-An instramental song which is basically a filler for the album, but has a very omonous sounding choir in the backround, along with the drums building to a huge crescendo..but never really reaching that crescendo...but it leaves you wondering.<br />Am I Going Insane(5/10)-One of the slower starting songs on the album, it takes a while to get into it, you have to listen to it at least 3 times before its a good song. Beucase the chorus just doesn't seem Sabbath, but with Iommis riffs it makes it work.<br />The Writ(10/10)-this track, the first time i heard it scared me a bit. The bass line at the beggining and the ominous demonic laughing was very intense and creepy, which is why sabbath is so great! They try adn freak you out, and they always succeed. Wonderful song, the bass in it is just amazing. Geezer really shines.<br />the bottom line is: If you are a Black Sabbath fan,and you don't own this album...you are not a Black Sabbath fan! This album is essential! So if the review of it was insightful, go pick it up.Thanks for reading.
B00005JKDR|4.0|\\"Monsters, Inc.\\" is a funny addition to anyone's Pixar library.  It's funnier than \\"A Bug's Life\\" and has a storyline that holds up better than \\"Toy Story.\\"  Sully and Mike are a great duo in this tale and it's fun to watch them interact with each other and Boo.  The opening sequence in the test \\"Scare\\" room is funny, and the following sequence at Sully's house is hilarious.  Steve Buscemi is a standout as Randall, the conniving culprit of the movie.  He's devilishly funny and Mr. Waternoose isn't so bad either.<br />All of the monsters in this movie are designed with brilliancy.  None of them come across as too scary for youngsters to watch.  A cameo appearance by the \\"Abominable Snowman\\" leads to a funny moment with yellow sno-cones.<br />My 2 year-old wouldn't stop watching this movie for weeks after we purchased it, and now she's hooked on it again.<br />Humor for adults is included as well, but there is nothing offensive about any part of this movie.  It's fun for everyone in the house and will hold the attention of even the toughest two year old critics.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|when i first heard this album, i thought oh my god this is just too much for any world to handle. i closed my eyes and opened my ears only to breath in the many talents of miss.keys voice. my favorite was and is \\" you don't know my name \\" it was like going back to a time when you were single and love and sex were all over your mind. this song went way back when people fought about love not killed about it. i just found it to be soothing and all to familiar to me.
B00007KWHN|4.0|This album is sometimes underrated by the fans, because it is pre-Wakeman, but, it is one of their best nonetheless. Starship trooper is one of the best songs and fan favorite on shows, and Howe playing The Clap is outstanding.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I saw the last two episodes of 'Firefly' when they were aired; laughed hysterically, marvelled at the fabulous smart writing-and then realized immediately that Fox would cancel it.  'Smart' is not something that Fox aims for with it's programming-and that's a shame. Fox had something approaching the quality of M*A*S*H on their hands with 'Firefly' and they missed it entirely.<BR>I gave 5 copies of 'Firefly' as gifts this Christmas; and 4 of those people have bought copies just to lend out to others who also missed the show because Fox shuffled it around so much...we're talking an age range here from 25 to 50.  <BR>That implies a huge, diverse audience just waiting for more.
B0000BWVCM|4.0|&quot;X-2&quot; picks up solidly where the original flick ended.  Unlike most reviewers, I didn't think this film was any better than the first.  I do believe that it is a good film in its own right.  The first sequence, the attack on the White House, is by far the best sequence of the movie.  Nightcrawler was one of my favorite X-men growing up.  I also enjoyed the fact that they included his deep Catholic faith.  The comic actually toyed with this character becoming a priest.<br />Overall, the action sequences in this film were great.  The Deathstryke/Wolverine battle was one of the most violent sequences I've seen in comic-to-screen adaptation.  It was more violent than all of &quot;Daredevil.&quot;  Wolverine came out of his shell in this movie by racking up a huge bodycount.<br />As far as the story goes, it played out very well and very evenly.  It was just as solid as the first flick and if you enjoyed the first one, this one will not let you down.  The pacing of the movie is quite swift, which could cause a non-comic fan to lose track of some of the characters and their abilities.  The ending was left wide open and if you do follow the comic, you know that something special will be rising in the inevitable part three.<br />A good action movie with a solid story and brilliant effects.  Buy it and enjoy it today.
B00005JLXE|1.0|I cannot believe there are acutally people out there who liked this movie! This has to be the worst movie ever made. When the movie first began, his childhood story seemed really well done but as the movie continued it just went from bad to worse. I can't believe anyone could sit through the entire movie, I turned it off within 30 minuets and that was torture enough!
0393057658|3.0|I enjoyed the concept of looking for objective measurements, challenging traditional views and methods, and choosing what to measure.<br />The locker-room lanquage was not needed to convey this concept.
B00000099Y|5.0|This CD is so good you don't even deserve to listen to it...you are not worthy. I promise.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|Amazing CD, great lyrics. Zach de la Rocha's voice is astounding, shouting out, in a form &quot;preaching&quot; as you could call it. Sure, you might not like how it sounds ,but it is about the message, first.
B00005JMCN|5.0|They simply don't make them like this anymore.  Studios simply do not cough up $80 million on a horse race movie with little or no CGI or an ensemble cast that may (operative word &quot;may&quot;) appeal to young audiences.  But kudos to Universal for taking a chance on writer/director Gary Ross' adaption of Laura Hillenbrand's novel &quot;Seabiscuit,&quot; the story of a hardluck horse who found his way to greatness.  To get him there, he needed the help of three emotionally bruised or distant men.  One is C.S. Howard (Jeff Bridges) the founder of Buick, his owner, who lost his marriage and his son in a short time frame.  Red Pollard (Tobey McGuire) is his jockey.  Left by his family who wanted him to have a better life, Red is too big for a joackey and too blind to ride.  Tom Smith (Chris Cooper) is the Biscuits' taciturn and eccentric trainer, but one who has an almost mystical understanding of what makes horses tick.  When these three come together, they start winning, and healing each other.  <br />Writer/Director Gary Ross avoids corniness and cliche by making these stories seem genuine instead of contrived, and he gets a lot of help from his cast, who do the story justice.  Chris Cooper is engaging as he hits all of Tom Smith's quirks and labored speech, Tobey McGuire gives perhaps his most heartfelt performance yet as the ailing jockey and Jeff Bridges is fantastic as the billionaire who found himself again after his divorce and his son's death.  And the sanctuary these men find is the racetrack, where editor William Goldenberg and cinematographer Ed Schwartzbaum are superb, planting you right in the middle of the hectic races.  And as perhaps the most entertaining part of this grand production is WIlliam H. Macy as the legendary race track commentator Tick Tock McGlocklin.  Macy nails all of the glock's busy and inventive wordplay and rapid-fire delivery, making him as fun as anything else in this fine film.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|how did they make a movie like this to bad it a continue story poltholes plotholes.
B00003CXA2|5.0|this movie is about a man sitting in a bench talking about earlier on in his life from when he was a child till he is now.  he isn't really a smart man but he sure can suposebly run fast. he in the begging couldn't walk good but then he learned and he was confident. this movie won an oscar for best pictures. it beat pul fiction witch in my knowing was a horrible movie and it made watch seinfeld.  but this movie is funny touching and it is a good movie for people that like story telling since this movie is a about a person telling a story about his past.
B00005N5S5|5.0|can someone plese help me find the hidden features on the dvd ive looked everywhere and cant find them. plese help me<BR>overall the dvd is great the 5.1 track is amazing and I like the choice to watch it with the mono track.

B00008PC2O|2.0|personally this dvd sucks it as almost no special features all the real special stuff is on dvd rom I dont have that. the commentary is ok but that doesnt change the subject really this dvd was made just to make a point that they could make the picture look better then ultimate and it only does look better if you have a home theather syestem and a widescreen tv.

B000003TA4|5.0|This is the album that changed music for a brief and wonderful time until Kurt died. Dont listen to people who say this album sucks for some reason if an album doesnt have big guitar solos people dont like it. KURT WAS A LYRICAL GENIUS and NIRVANA ARE AND ALWAYS WILL BE THE GREATEST BAND OF ALL TIME.
6304493681|3.0|Japanese animated films are unusual. A lot more effort goes into them than for conventional western animated films. The extras on this DVD illustrate this and show that the attention to detail included the fact that when bullets were fired they sparked when they hit metal but not other surfaces. The plots are also multi dimensional and the characters more realistic. (There is of course something strange suggesting that animated characters are realistic)<br />This is a science fiction story set in the near future in a strange city that from a distance looks like New York but up close looks like Bangcock or Hong Kong. In the future law enforcement officers are not entirely human. They are people who have had parts of their bodies reconstructed using mechanical parts like the old television series the six million dollar man. The central character is a cyborg who probably has some form of human brain but is constructed in the form of a 20 year old playboy centrefold. She is involved in tracking down a computer hacker who is able to plant false memories into people so that they become his unwilling agents. <br />The film is one that is perhaps more action packed than a Stevan Seagal move with well constructed car chases shoot outs and so on. However it contains meditations on the nature of human identity, a debate sparked by the villain who in changing peoples memories changes the nature of people. A good deal of the film is obviously taken from Blade Runner. The feel and atmospherics and some of the lines of the characters interrogating those who  have become the agents of the villain. <br />Perhaps more interestingly the film seems to be an inspiration for a number of ideas in the Matrix. The opening titles were clearly the basis for the visual portrayal of the matrix itself. Others have commented on how the main character of this film is a role model for Trinity. <br />In watching the film was is amazed by the skill in the animation. The street scapes, the movement ofthe people in the background, the use of focus to create the impression of depth and movement. All in all a considerable achievement if at the end of the day it is only a science fiction adventure film with a slightly hackneyed ending.
B000002KIE|5.0|This is one of the first punk cds that I bought, and I think it's a great one for anyone who is into punk to own.This album is a classic. The Sex Pistols never fail in they're in your face lyrics and great beats. This is a must-own and I reccomend it to everyone.
B000002KKK|3.0|Ok folks, time for a real review rather than just a big fan air kiss.<br />Deguello.  This LP marked the trios return to the active limelight from a several year hiatus. The results at times are excellent while others previewed the MTV fuzzy guitar \\"we sing of cars and girls with big boobs\\" schtick era that was soon to come. \\"Maniac Mechanic\\" and \\"Esther be the One\\" are examples of this. These two songs foreshadow where the band is going artistically (or was it just Billy G?).<br />There are strong bows to thier earlier 70s works with instant ZZ classics like \\"Cheap Sunglasses\\" and \\"I'm Bad I'm Nationwide.\\" While lyrically not as good as the London era recordings. These efforts redeem the record and make it a worthy purchase. The cover of Elmore James \\"Dust My Broom\\" is also pretty good.<br />Overall, compared with the highwater mark of the early 70s this album is a departure but still has enough honest and rockin' qualities to keep it a nice addition. <br />Its after this album it all goes to hell.
B00008J4P5|1.0|Finally, something that's better then the others.  But yet you ask; &quot;Why give it one star?&quot;  Well, it SUCKS!!!  Yes, it SUCKS!!!  Those other C.D.'s by this artist SUCK even MORE!!!  And I hear Jack White received an award for best guitar from MTV...  Clearly, those people are out of their minds, and probably don't know what good guitar sounds like.  And, why does Meg always use those cymbals?  And, as a bassist/guitarist, I find it somewhat stupid that they don't hire a full-time bassist.  It's also a bit &quot;insulting.&quot;
B000005HAU|5.0|I do not know where to begin,<br /> This selection of standards are all among my favorites, and they are rendered by a musician I consider the greatest guitarista in the world (And I have listened to the masters, from Wes to Brasilian legend Heraldo do Monte, and all points in between), mestre Bireli LaGrene.<br />  A child prodigy, playing Django Reinhardt -style in the &quot;Gipsy-jazz&quot; tradition, this is well known, ..or, IS IT?<br />If Bireli was American, he would be a &quot;guitar hero&quot; in the USA, instead of a marginalized musician underappreciated and underexposed. but, IMO&gt;&gt;<br />  He is a Rom (Gipsy) from the Alsace-Lorraine region,and  it is a rare moment (The cliche &quot;cold day in hell&quot; ) that the USian jazz community gives any credit to a non-American &quot;jazzman&quot; as an innovator, or maestro of the idiom.<br />The rare times of acknowledgement, it is a Tubby Hayes, NHOP, Michel Petrucianni, that is,(if I may bold state), one who is not a &quot;person of color&quot;, as a Joe Harriott or our man Bireli.<br />Then again, also there is the equal repugnant &quot;you have to be black to play jazz&quot; thing, ih! Give us the BREAK, no?<br /> Equal adept at the traditional gipsy styles(Check his recent cd, &quot;The Gipsy Project&quot; for an update on the Django tradition), bebop, jazz fusion and even hard rock idiomas, acustic and electric guitar and bass, I can only praise,<br /> Bireli LaGrene is not only a formidable technician of the instrument(He plays it, it does not &quot;Play&quot; him), but his harmonic and melodic concepts are displayed in beautiful chord voicings and substitutions, and solo lines that run from lightning speed 64th notes to simply stated articulations every solo a work of art, not an excercise in technical excess.<br /> As in Wes Montgomery's concept, you never notice the technical aspect of the playing, as the melodic statements are so beautiful and conversational.<br />(You must see Bireli in concert, he plays lines at the spur of the moments that most musicians would kill to conceive..)<br /> This recording touches on the bebop tradition<br />~&quot;Donna Lee&quot; and &quot;Ornithology&quot; from the Charlie PArker book),<br />~ &quot;Stella by Starlight&quot; and &quot;Softly as A Morning Sunrise&quot; from the &quot;Real Book&quot; school,<br />~&quot;C'est Si Bon&quot; from The French and<br />~Jobim's timeless &quot;Insensatez&quot;, among others ,<br />this recording a &quot;must have&quot; for ALL guitaristas and guitar enthusiasts, but also for ALL jazz fans, the innovation and genius of Birlei's musical conception is evedent in every bar of every composition!

B00009W0U4|5.0|If you have a weak stomach or are easily offended you will not like this movie. That said, Irreversible is actually an extremely well crafted film. The character development and dialogue are first-rate and extremely realistic. You come to know these people and identify with them. Had the movie not been done in reverse order, you may have actually cared for them.<br />You have never seen violence this realistic on screen before (not since Bunuel and Dali's \\"The Andalusian Dog\\" at least). Horrific and beautifully done. The main complaint of critics seems to be that the violence is gratuitous. That may be, but it brings about a feeling of revulsion in the normal person, which I think is the point. Additionally, the movie does not glorify violence at all. There is nothing erotic or sexually exciting about the rape scene. And the violence at the night club has real consequences.<br />I laugh at you people who are offended by this yet see no problem in the glorification and sanitization of violence by mainstream Hollywood.
B000059XXZ|2.0|The first Batman movie has got to be one of the most cheesiest heroic movies of all times. I've watched this film over and over and over again, and it still doesn't get to me.  It's full of too much romance and way too much violence.  I wasn't too thrilled with the pick of characters for this film.  Jack Nicholson did an okay job as &quot;The Joker&quot;, but again here's another movie where Michael Keaton is playing himself.  He never takes his Batman job seriously.  And I can't stand Kim Basinger in this film!  Her wardrobe is God-awful!!  When you're on a date, at least comb your hair and put on a decent dress than something handed from a second-hand store.  And I can't stand her screaming in about every other horror scene.  This Batman movie was a joke to begin with.  The other two Batman movies were okay, despite the last one was without Michael Keaton.<br />I was hoping for an action-packed movie when it first came out, unfortunately, I was very disappointed.
B000002J1U|5.0|I loved when this LP appeared - it fooled everyone on the heels of Led Zeppelin 2. Those were such great, experimental times before the bean counters took over film and music. Aghhh!!!  Anyway, this is one of the most underrated rock LPs in rock history.  \\"Tangerine,\\" \\"That's the Way,\\" \\"Friends,\\" and OH! and I'll tell you what sex is: it's called \\"Since I've Been Loving You.\\"  Talk about fire in the groins!  This remastered version is great, too. Rah-rah.
0142001104|2.0|After reading the reviews here, I thought this book might be a nice inspirational read. It has a few decent moments, but for the most part I could barely force myself to keep reading. I got through about 75% of it, then just had to skim the last few chapters because I couldn't take it anymore. I dunno--if you play in a symphony orchestra, you're into reading sappy and/or narcissistic little personal tales, or you just have to read every single inspirational book that gets published, you may like this. Not the worst book I've ever read, by a long shot, but not good enough to keep or recommend, so I'm giving it two stars.
B000002J09|5.0|THIS IS ONE KICK BUTT ALBUM AND THERE IS NOTHING THAT ENGAGES AND CAPTIVATES LIKE \\"WHEN THE LEVEE BREAKS\\".<br />Love it to death. Thanks Zep.
6305350205|3.0|This movie seemed to have bad word of mouth even before it opened in the summer of '89 (most of it dealing with &quot;Shatner directed it.  It's gonna be awful&quot;).  And it isn't.  Awful is reserved for Star Trek:the monumentally dull motion picture.  And I will return to Five before I go back and watch Three.  In the DVD extras, everyone interviewed seems to take a slightly apologetic apporoach and the prodeedings are subdued.  Really, there's no need to be.  ST 5 is funny and charming and exciting .. about what you would get from a superior episode of the original show.  It's a little goopy in some places, but Roddenberry (show's creator) EXCELLED at goopy.  5 has all the action and wit of any better-than-average action movie of the 80s (this movie has a very 80s feel, but that's not saying it in a bad way).  It seems that the band wagon persists and people will choose to diminish this one when the first movie and its bloated ponderousness really needs to be explained and apologized for.  5 is fun.  5 is charming.  And 5 is exciting.  I just wish that the people responsible for this movie didn't feel the need to be apologetic.  It's a pretty nifty film.
B000002U82|5.0|I was fortunate enough to be at Scope audiotorium the cold early Spring of the original Dark Side Tour in the schizoid spring of 1973, in an altered state sitting next to the campus cop who kept our stash safe in the dorms.  Three black kids were sitting in front of us and we found that radical, and hopeful, and they were toking and nodding, and everyone pretty much melted when the planes flew around the coliseum in Quadrophonic, but when the three girls came out and the lead took over &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky,&quot; we all knew we were present at something new and special that would define our time.<br />And it did.
B00005JLRT|4.0|The main disappointment for any fan of ST:TNG is that the movies seemed to progressively get away from what made the show so terrific: a real team feeling (unlike the classis Trek with its triumverate and then the supporting crew), a sense of balance between action and wit, and the much-improved Enterprise-D.  The movies became dark affairs, including the ship(s), bathed in shadows and appearing cavernous and unsavory.  Data and Picard took one stage and the rest of the crew did whatever they could.  The films of the new crew are good .. they just don't have what fans loved about the show.  NEMESIS is really dark and unsavory, but there is some balance, and the feel of the movie is almost operatic in consequence.  It's good (Tom Hardy as Shinzon is amazing)and it contains stuff you've never seen.  But it has that dark feeling that the show, even at its most daring, never had.  Really .. would you want to serve aboard that Enterprise?  It's like the Munster's house?  But give NEMESIS credit for making a movie that tries to be unique and thoughtful and exciting.  It achieves, but at the cost of sacrificing what was loved about TNG crew and its voyages.
B000002JSN|5.0|&quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; is a double-disc album of previously unreleased tracks released in 1975.  Every track keeps Led Zeppelin at the top of their game.  They prove on this album that they are one of the best rock bands in music history, even when they feel that a certain recording cannot make the individual album cut.  Though this album is much less experimental than what they're known for, their style keeps listeners interested in every musical note.  They continue to offer the musical variety that has always pleased audiences.  Their rare experimental sounds presented keeps them unique: middle eastern (&quot;Kashmir&quot;), folk (&quot;Black Country Woman&quot;), and blues.  Every track has its own catchy theme.  Whether it's John Bonham's melody crazy drumming, Jimmy Page's repetative guitar riffs, or Robert Plant's hard-hitting lyrics, their individual talents offer an amazing musical journey.  &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; is an essential album for all Led Zeppelin fans.  This is sure to keep listeners entertained regardless how many album listens.

B000002UZ6|5.0|Tina Turner is without a shadow of a doubt the queen diva. She is a living legend and a symbol of survival and success. This album is a solid collection of her all time greatest hits. The UK one is slightly different with the inclusion of &quot;Addicted To Love&quot; and &quot;Be Tender With Me Baby&quot; and the ommitance of &quot;What You Get Is What You See&quot; and &quot;Look Me In The Heart&quot;. From her outstanding anthem &quot;What's Love Got To Do With It&quot; to the tangy &quot;Steamy Windows&quot; this album makes Tina shine.<BR>Although it is great, there are notable songs missing. Hopefully, now that Tina is back in action again she will release a whole new album with all her greatest hits included, if it was at it's best it would probably look like this:<br />CD1<BR>1) &quot;Simply The Best&quot;<BR>2) &quot;What's Love Got To Do With It&quot;<BR>3) &quot;When The Heartache Is Over&quot;<BR>4) &quot;Nutbush City Limits&quot; (orginal version)<BR>5) &quot;Typical Male&quot;<BR>6) &quot;We Don't Need Another Hero&quot;<BR>7) &quot;Help&quot;<BR>8) &quot;On Silent Wings&quot; (featuring Sting)<BR>9) &quot;Private Dancer&quot;<BR>10) &quot;Look Me In The Heart&quot;<BR>11) &quot;I Don't Wanna Lose You&quot;<BR>12) &quot;Steamy Windows&quot;<BR>13) &quot;Typical Male&quot;<BR>14) &quot;It Takes Two&quot; (featuring Rod Stewart)<BR>15) &quot;I Don't Wanna Fight&quot;<br />CD2<BR>1) &quot;Better Be Good To Me&quot;<BR>2) &quot;Addicted To Love&quot;<BR>3) &quot;What You Get Is What You See&quot;<BR>4) &quot;Proud Mary&quot;<BR>5) &quot;I Can't Stand The Rain&quot;<BR>6) &quot;Let's Stay Together&quot;<BR>7) &quot;Whatever You Need&quot;<BR>8) &quot;Be Tender With Me Baby&quot;<BR>9) &quot;River Deep, Mountain High&quot;<BR>10) &quot;Simply The Best&quot; (featuring Jimmy Barnes)<BR>11) &quot;Goldeneye&quot;<BR>12) &quot;Show Some Respect&quot;<BR>13) &quot;Proud Mary&quot; (featuring Elton John and Cher from VH1 Divas '99)<BR>14) &quot;In Your Wildest Dreams&quot; (featuring Barry White)<BR>15) &quot;Great Spirits&quot;
B000001ESJ|5.0|After the success of the powerfull lenghty epical &quot;2112&quot;, the canadian trio Rush started a new era of well produced and complex albums and left behind the zeppelin-hard-rock of their three first albums. &quot;A Farewell to Kings&quot;, from 77, is Rush at their most complex, fast, angry and melodic side! For many fans, its their masterpiece, for me, its one of their highligths. Im sure that many consider &quot;A Farewell to Kings&quot; the first album of their best phase, that finishes with the very good synht-dominated &quot;Signals&quot;, in 82. In Farewell, the bassist Geddy Lee used the moog synth for the first time, and many 12 string guitars were added to their sound. These intruments gave a new colour to the early Rush sound, and the great live tours since 74 really improved the musicians skills, making &quot;A Farewell to Kings&quot; a delightful Rush album ! The title track is a formidable example of a complex compass and a very rich rhythm section surrounded by a really good fat bass and a marvelous guitar solo. Point for Alex Lifeson, that really evolved his guitar sound since &quot;2112&quot;. Xanadu is a classic Rush track. A heavenly atmosphere in the intro, most because of the exotic percussive effects by Neil Peart (bells, chimes, gong...). The rest of the track brings heavy guitar riffs, formidable drumming, moogs and 12 str. guitars !!! Maybe the best track  of the album. &quot;Closer to the Heart&quot; is a short and very beautiful track, a little bit pop-oriented , with all charachteristics of 70s Rush sound (&quot;Closer to the Heart&quot; was their first big hit). &quot;Cinderella man&quot; is another complex short song, with that huge rhythm section (that goes breaking everything troughout the album !). &quot;Madrigal&quot; is a soft song, with many acoustic guitars, just to relax the listener to the hard-progressive &quot;Cygnus X-1&quot;. This track continuous its history in &quot;Hemispheres&quot;, the next album. Its a lenghty track, like &quot;Xanadu&quot;, but heavier and faster (Neil Peart really kicks-off !). In summary, get this album, listen to it carefully and enjoy the best phase of this phenomenal band. The next four albums would bring excellent Rush compositions, that differs in texture and composition style, but all still excellent !
0385504209|5.0|... is the second of Brown's novels involving Harvard professor Robert Langdon, and no doubt the most popular - it's now been on the best-seller list for a year!  I won't reveal any of DA VINCI CODE's plot, but I will say this: the novel deserves every bit of outstanding criticism it is receiving.  Brown's writing style reminds me of Michael Crichton; he writes so as to make the book perfectly absorbing and extremely thrilling - THE DA VINCI CODE is the biggest page-turner I've ever read.  Dan Brown has also brought Langdon to resemble best-selling author Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan character; hopefully Brown will be writing as long as Clancy has now.  Enough good words cannot be said about this flawless masterpiece of modern fiction, full of mystery, suspense, and featuring a heavily-researched storyline; it is simply one of the best books I've ever read.  If you haven't read it yet, I cannot emphasize how much you are missing.  Ignore the pitiful, angry comments towards the book and buy it today.  It is undoubtedly a decision you shall not regret.  I am now officially a Dan Brown fan - keep writing, Mr. Brown.  I can't wait for Robert Langdon's next adventure!
B000063DFQ|3.0|How can I call an album a classic and yet give it 3 stars????<br />Well, I have to admit that I am a little inconsistant with the stars in my ratings, but with 5 stars an all time masterpiece, which only a few albums can rate and 4 stars in my book being a classic album that is a personal favorite and highlight of the bands career....I had to rate Piece of Mind just a little lower due to some filler material, the good but way overplayed songs, and some lyrics that are just plain stupid...here's a breakdown:<br />Where Eagles Dare - One of the best Maiden tracks of all time...This song has incredible drumming...great lyrics...awesome vocals...its one the best songs Maiden ever did...<br />Revelations - Another of Maidens all time gretest tracks....Once again great playing...vocals...lyrics...this song has it all...<br />Flight of Icarus .....One of Maiden's better known tracks and more widely played radio songs (At least in America)...The solo and the chorous are so good that I never tire of this song...no matter how often I here it..<br />After that great 1,2,3..howevre, the album begins to fade...<br />Die With your Boots On.....I know this is a fan facorite and it has a cool main riff and verse..but I always thought the chorus was kind of plain and uninteresting....Also...I can't figure out what the hell this song is suppossed to be about...<br />The Trooper - One of Maidens best known songs and it is good, but a bit like Sabbath's Paranoid...every teenager who picked up a guitar in the last 20 years learned this riff badly and that memory lingers when I hear the song...<br />Still Life - Musically this song rocks...very strong..Lyrically, although as a teenager I dug it...it sounds kind of ridiclus 20 years later...A guy having nightmares about his pool is like a bad Freddy Krueger movie...<br />Quest for Fire - A horrible song with stupid lyrics and uninteresting riff. The chorus is straight out of Spinal Tap...<br />Sunlight on your steel - This song is ok, butwayyy to bland..and once again the singing tries to make dumb sounding lyrics seem important...Very Spinal Tap...<br />To Tame a Land - The album concludes on an up-note with To Tame a Land, which is based on the novel Dune....It is one of the better Maiden epic closers, second maybe only to Rime of the Ancient Mariner and makes the previous two songs seem somewhat worth the effort once you get to it...<br />All and all I recomend this album and if your a Maiden fan you'll love it...Its one of their best...Personally...They have sevreal other releases that I find more complete, but the first 3 songs and To Tame a Land make it well worth the money...
B0000640VO|5.0|The French movie starts off with a butterfly landing in the street, then getting run over. That same day, Amelie is born into this world. Beauty reformed--ironically, another word for ameliorate (Amelie--ameliorate?).<br />In this charming piece of award winning cinematography, Amelie is raised in a rather dysfunctional family by her parents. Her father, who likes to invest time in his miniature shrine, mourns over the loss of his wife, who was killed by a suicidal body from the sky near the doors of Notre Dame. During Amelie's skewed youth, she turns much to her imagination.<br />Life's simple pleasures come easy to Amelie--at least in her mind. Her newfound passion for helping others serves gratifying, yet her preference for publicity was unwanted. She plays the role of a female Zorro, helping strangers without adopting credit. She lashes her sword against an evil force whom maltreats a man's love for quality produce. Intrigued by what I mean? Watch the movie.<br />In time, her heart of gold crosses paths with another man, one whom seeks a mystery of his own. Amelie becomes a second mystery in the man's life by marking clues of her existence after retaining his research he had dropped while chasing his mystery entity in a certain scene. After returning his odd memoir, she leads him through her fantasy and falls in love. Both were dreamers. Both were seeking love. Both lived shadows in a seemingly different world. Still intrigued? Watch the movie.<br />If you are also a person who looks for the \\"art\\" in a movie, one can not help but notice the complexity of the cinematography to which it's most defined for amongst film critics and analysts. The use of 3 basic colors in the movie was a challenge which proved to be worth taking. Green, red, and a speck of blue was used in nearly every shot. As you will notice after watching the film, its colors and montage are bold. The use of the limited colors helped create a mystical, mesmerizing gold color in which was used in a few scenes to accentuate significant signs or emotions. The camera shots used were just as well creative and challenging, which deserves recognition as well.<br />This movie is not for those who are seeking action-packed drama with the high level of thrill and suspense one might expect from a highly acclaimed film. This film can be appreciated by those who enjoy the simple pleasures life has to offer. It can be appreciated by those with colorful imaginations and avid art-lovers.<br />Intriguing?

B00003W8NM|5.0|Ever get those movies you get tired of the 3rd or 4th time you see it? This isn't one of those films it can be watched numerous times and you won't get sick of it and you will catch something new everytime you watch. This is the best book to movie adpation I have ever seen Chuck Palahniuk brought us into the demented world of Tyler Durden and David Fincher hit the nail on the head with this film. It's about our beloved Jack who suffers from Insomonia and is searching for himself. He begins to attend Group therapy groups where he meets a just as derranged Marla Singer. After his condo blows up his calls a soap salesman he met on one of his flights and we enter the world of Tyler Durden. Fight Club isnt for the weak of heart and will not dissappoint. Watch this movie!
0385504209|4.0|Dan Brown's books are interesting on many fronts. I like the way he weaves facts and history into a decent plot.<br />While I do not rate this book as highly as &quot;Angels and Demons&quot; it is still very good and a worthwhile read.<br />My main problem with &quot;The DaVinci Code&quot; is that the outcome is very predictable given that the author would not have the book's characters actually find the Ark.<br />Some Catholics schooled by nuns will be shocked and upset by the truth about Mary Magdalene.  The truth hurts.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|I just picked up Sarah McLachlan's latest album, and it's great. Yet I'm not exactly sure why the album is called Afterglow, because for the most part the lyrics are kind of dark, which is a little obvious with titles like \\"Fallen\\", \\"World On Fire\\", and \\"Train Wreck\\". In fact, speculation started that there may be problems in her marriage with fellow percussionist Ashwin Sood.<br />But that doesn't mean this album is worth skipping - far from it, in fact. What could be the album's best song is \\"Push\\", which is a smooth declaration to her man complete with nice background vocals. But the Grammy-nominated \\"Fallen\\" isn't far behind. And \\"Time\\" and \\"Dirty Little Secret\\" are great pensive tales.<br />I said this MIGHT be Sarah's best album only because I didn't hear all of her old stuff. But this is still a great recording. Like I said before, most of the songs are dark in subject matter, but the songs are still captivating and less boring than, say, Beck's Sea Change (sorry, I tried my best to like that album). All comparisons aside, Afterglow is a tremendous album that I should have picked up sooner.<br />Anthony Rupert
B00013PHGS|2.0|After the now legendary &quot;Moon Safari&quot; Air seem to have developed a knack of bringing out albums that are by no means poor but which are also hardly memorable..With the exception of certain moments in the soundtrack of the &quot;Virgin Suicides&quot; everything else and especially &quot;10.000hz&quot; (their previous one) have been rather bland and driveless.<br />   Those on the look-out for Air's latest release must be somewhat dissapointed with &quot;Talkie Walkie&quot; unless of course your delving into electronica isn't all that deep. Otherwise, it'd be easy to know that releases like this are a dozen-a-penny in this scene. <br />    &quot;Talkie Walkie&quot; suffers from all the same problems like its predecessor. While the production is fine, the vocals are ok, and the lyrics, well, acceptable, the overall feeling especially when it comes to the music itself is that this is a &quot;so what&quot; proposition. Lacking drive but more importantly ideas, this album floats about without really going anywhere and without having anyway to distinguish itself from several other releases in the electronic field. If this was anybody else's debut album it would be called &quot;promising&quot;. Being that it's Air's it cant have such compliments attributed to it.<br />    It will satisfy you if your expectations aren't high or if your awareness of this scene is rather superficial. But for electronica insiders this is hardly an album with enough in it to make it a &quot;must buy&quot;.<br />    If Air have settled in with their status in the genre I'm afraid we're bound to see more of this &quot;quality&quot; in the future. It remains to be seen but the omens are not really optimistic...

B00007L4LL|4.0|Kate and Leopold is the tale of a duke who has never been in love and, by accident, finds his true love in the future. While the plot could have allowed for a bit more character development, the actors all do a wonderful job in their roles. Hugh Jackman is especially charming in his portrayal of the displaced duke. This movie has a happy ending, but it cries out for a sequel. I would really like to see how Kate adjusts to a time without modern conveniences and how Leopold handles their financial problems, now that a rich wife is out of the question. (I believe the film hints that he becomes an inventor.) Kate's brother and ex-boyfriend could travel backward to join them in some plot twist or other -- possibly to save one of Kate's children from danger. If handled properly, the sequel could be even better than the original.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|Being a huge Pink Floyd fan, I was psyched when I heard that \\"Live in Pompeii\\" was being released on dvd.  I, like any loyal fan, already have it on video, but my copy was becoming run down.  Now with the dvd, I have the original and the new directors cut.  The directors cut has extra footage and is in animorphic widescreen, which I just love.  One of the great things about Floyd is watching them perform.  So, to see Waters and Gilmore together is cool.  I have the \\"Pulse\\" dvd, which is great, but is missing Roger Waters.  The scenic shots of old Pompeii and the ampetheater they play at are beautiful.  The whole movie is a trip, and any Floyd fan should enjoy this dvd.
B00003CXI1|4.0|This first film of the popular book series has its occasional flaws, (notably through the Norbert story) but it is a fair adaption of a wonderful tale.
B00004Z4WQ|3.0|i liked this movie alot, but there were some things that were boring and sexual. If you want a funny movie this is it, but be ready for some R scenes. WARNING: dont let this movie fall into a 10 or unders hands, it might be too much. there were some bare laughs but its a (dirty) movie sorta. This movie is not scary!
B000000I0D|4.0|First song, 20 minutes &quot;Crises&quot; is as good as &quot;Tubular bells&quot;.  The first 2 minutes are maybe a bit too new age but the rest is really uncredible especially the Watcher and the tower part.  The great Admam Ant is playing guitar on this song.<br />Song &quot;In high places&quot; is sang by Jon Anderson (I just can't resist him).  I did not know it was Oldfield who did &quot;Shadow on the wall&quot;, a song that I liked a lot back in early 80's.  Well, it is on this album.  &quot;Taurus&quot; is a excellent  accoustic guitar piece.<br />The 2 others songs are okay but I am not attracted to women's voice.
B00003CX8U|1.0|This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen! It is<BR>profane, indecent, confusing and dragged out into a very<BR>boring ending.

B000001DYY|5.0|It's the Tears for fears's album that I like the most.  Maybe because it was not as popular as the other ones and I never get tired since it is not over played.<br />&quot;Good night song&quot; is my favorite but every other songs have something special in it.  Check out &quot;Brian Wilson song&quot; starting at 1:50 minutes how the music is beautiful.<br />By the way, Tears for fears came back together and just finished a new album that should be out in April 2004.  Curtis said, our best album so far.  Can't wait to see that.

0446608955|5.0|This book was truly remarkable!  I saw the movie when it first came out but after just finishing the book, I loved the book more.  It really is a tear jerker, a great rainy/snowy day read.  The story line was just wonderful.  I would recommend this book to many others and will read it again soon!
B00000F6LQ|1.0|Yes,we all know that the film itself is the &quot;Sgt.Pepper&quot;of their career.( I say that with all affection ). We further know that the 2 Disc. Set is the best version ever released! ( Even if it doesn't have the full Japanese soundtrack like the original Critereon version...SHHH! )<br />So....why is it,that less than two years after the original 2 Disc. release,did THIS version get released? And why would you buy it?<br />The Discs. are EXACTLY the same.( Not to mention the original release 2 disc. set is STILL available.)<br />The Script Booklet? ( The original is still available,and WITH all the cool photos.)( And,not to mention,if you put the English captions on,it's the same as having the script book! )<br />The Film Cell? ( It's not even a unique image. It's the Knights at the Castle of Guy DeLombard,looking up at the French Taunter. )<br />The Pretty Black Box? ( It's not THAT pretty,and not as black as say,the cover of &quot;Smell the Glove&quot; )<br />Basically it's a tarted up rip-off aimed at unsuspecting Python fans! Buy the original 2 Disc. Set and save your money!
B00000DC7J|5.0|This album is incredible.<br />Piazzolla and the New Tango Quintet play with extraordinary cohesion, grace, nuance, fire, and absolute beauty. They play as one, and they switch sentiments, from tenderness to rage to anxiety to resolve, without warning and without flaw. Listening to this music is like looking through a sonic kaleidoscope. The textures mutate constantly, at times pensive and sparse, at others empassioned and dense. But always full of color and absolutely beautiful.
B0000DC151|5.0|Forget what some of these disgruntled viewers are saying about Season 5 -- it's just as delightful to watch as the first four seasons.<br />The characters are still rich in depth and sketched with compassion.  Notably, there is an undertone of poignancy and even loneliness that I cannot help but link to the fact that these were written and filmed post 9/11.<br />Not to worry: these characters will still make you laugh!<br />I love NYC.   And I love Sex and the City.
B00005JME0|5.0|Before I go on to describe why I liked this movie, I should explain right away that this is mostly a rebuttal of what the critics say. I think that this movie has received an unfair amount of criticism and I want to rebut some of the main points people have brought up.<br />Firstly, if you go into the movie expecting Kutcher to suck in his role, then he probably will as far as you are concerned. It is tough to accept him as a dramatic lead, I admit, but if you try to not let his past interfere with your judgement, then it will free you to focus on the movie itself (something that very few mainstream critics seem to have done seriously).<br />Secondly, if you watch this with the wrong group of people, then its mood changes drastically. I saw it in a crowded theater full of people who either came in expecting a comedy or were just planning to trash it. What happened was that I really enjoyed the movie, but many others complained constantly. Because this opened up the floor for criticism, many others joined in--this is an effect you can see frequently in any event where there are a lot of people. If everybody's laughing, then you are tempted to laugh. So, I reccommend that you try to see this only with an audience that you know will take it seriously, because otherwise it will ruin your enjoyment of the film.<br />\\"The Butterfly Effect\\" is a lot like other major science-fiction movies from the past in that it tries out a lot of new things and worries only about the elements it was created to serve. A good comparison brings to my mind the movie \\"Dark City,\\" which received very little praise or attention during its initial release. Both movies expect you to care for the characters without spending a great deal of time building them up. Both movies are more focused on answering the question, \\"What if?\\" and then trying to create a world where strange possibilities can be discovered.<br />The movie has been criticized for being overly violent and too melodramatic. Too violent? Not so. Melodramatic? Not really, although I'll grant you that one or two points are a bit heavy-handed. Extremely disturbing? Yes.<br />The violent content within is not exploitative in anyway--what it does is provides extreme environments for the \\"butterfly effect\\" theme to work with. The concept of the film is based on how much would change if you fixed one mistake in the past. To make these changes more interesting, the filmmakers have come up with some extreme material. For example, early in the film two of the main characters are sexually abused as children. By changing this event, the characters lives become drastically different. If Kutcher's character had instead went back in time and changed an event such as, say, his first hair cut, then there would probably not be a huge change in his life. So, the movie wouldn't be very interesting, nor would it explore the \\"What if\\" question very well.<br />In the end, this movie is about ideas and exploration. It is a great movie because it heavily explores the concept of time travel and its effects on the future. It is not a movie for everyone, but I have a feeling that many people who would like it are going to be scared away (probably by the presence of Kutcher, who does a respectable job).<br />I found it very clever, exciting, and thoroughly enjoyable. The acting is great all around and it is the first true thinking-man's (or -woman's) film I've seen for several years. Ultimately, though, I think it will find its audience on DVD and video. I can only hope, because it's a gem from our era.
B00005JLEU|5.0|An excellent story with a superb animation. This movie will appeal to all children and adults who like to be surprised.
B0000VAFO0|1.0|There are two kinds of directorial debuts. There are the kinds that instantly establish directors as critically-acclaimed and immensely talented, and then there are movies like &quot;Underworld.&quot; Len Wiseman's vampires vs. werewolves flick had so much promise, and just about all of it is squandered.<br />The vampires and Lycans have been at war for centuries, for reasons that are revealed later in the movie. Selene (Kate Beckinsale) is one of the vampires whose sole duty and purpose is to hunt down and kill the Lycans (a &quot;death dealer,&quot; har har) with guns that shoot silver bullets. The Lycans, in turn, fire ultraviolet bullets that can kill the vampires. Whatever.<br />Enter Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman), a young human who is being followed by the Lycans. Selene is intrigued by why he's important to the Lycans, but unfortunately he's been bitten by one, and is now in danger of becoming one. To uncover the answers about why Corvin is important, Selene will uncover the truth about both the Lycan and vampire races -- and secrets about her own past.<br />There hasn't been a halfway decent vampire flick in uncounted years, or a decent werewolf flick in even longer. Looks like that  Taking &quot;Underworld&quot; even semi-seriously is hard to do; it's like the unwanted illegitimate child of &quot;Matrix&quot; and &quot;Blade,&quot; without the appeal of either. The special effects are okay, but the story and action (not to mention the near-nonexistant romance) are as cold and clammy as a vampire's kiss.<br />Wiseman's clumsiness is shown vividly in the action scenes, which are all cloned from &quot;Matrix&quot; -- lots of bullets, swirling leather and antigravity jumps. And some humor might have elevated this film to action camp, but heroes and villains alike are so earnest that they almost come across as goofy. There are plenty of gaping plot holes that could have been avoided (why do vampires spend all their time lounging around?), but Wiseman apparently doesn't bother to try spackling them shut.<br />Kate Beckinsale, a talented young actress, is horribly wasted here. Most of her time is spent pouting and wearing how-can-she-move leather. Her chemistry with Speedman is nil, which is good, since the romance between them is also virtually nonexistant. Speedman does what he can, but he doesn't have much to work with. Bill Nighy alone gets to chew the scenery as senior vamp Viktor.<br />Relentlessly hokey and humorless, &quot;Underworld&quot; is an effort to elevate style over substance. In the end, it doesn't have either. Watch it with some friends to mock it, but otherwise don't bother.y doesn't bother to try spackling them shut.<br />Kate Beckinsale, a talented young actress, is horribly wasted here.

B0000VAFO0|4.0|The idea behind a secret war between Vampires and Werewolves is something new at least, but throw away any ideas you may have about a battle of teeth and claws. Most of the fighting is done with high-tech weaponry. In fact the only actual act commited by any of the Vampires, that resembles what you would think a Vampire would do, occurs late in the movie. The Werewolves (Lycans) do tend to show their tendancies more. They &quot;make the change&quot; quite more often.<br />But this film goes past a mere sci-fi gory bloodbath. Although it doesn't really seem like one exists early, there is a plot. And it's not a bad one, but the film does tend to get pretty predictable. That would have to be it's main downfall.<br />If you can put aside the predictability and the lack of Vampires being traditional Vampires, then this film will go over quite well with you.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|C'est clair que at the drive-in est le meilleur band que j'ai entendue jusqu'a maintenant. Le cd relationship on command est surement le meilleur cd fait par at the drive-in.

B00013PHGS|5.0|It's hard to describe with words the sound of Air's music, because there's not a lot you can reference it to. The phrase &quot;tripped out elevator music&quot;  comes to mind, but even that doesn't seem to do it justice. &quot;Talkie Walkie&quot; is otherworldly, soothing, beautiful, dreamy ... the songs sound both alien and familiar, like the soundtrack to a forgotten dream. My favorite tracks so far are &quot;Run&quot;, which extracts certain words from the verses and merges them with the beat, creating a trance-like affect, and &quot;Mike Mills&quot; which sounds like music you might hear at the Renaissance Festival on another planet. This is the perfect album to fall asleep to, make art to, make love to, or maybe play while hosting a sophisticated dinner party. Long live these groovy french dudes!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I missed this series when it aired but took a chance on the DVD because of Joss Whedon's track record and the number of good reviews it garnered on this site. What a great series, mainly because it had a great, ensemble cast. The network really screwed up by not showing the pilot first. The show works as a sci/fi western but is so much better when you get into the  characters and their histories. I think that the episodes &quot;Out of Gas&quot; and &quot;Objects in Space&quot; were two on the finest hours of TV I have seen. Sign me up if this series goes direct to DVD.
B000003C5C|5.0|Leprosy is a GREAT release, Deaths second album, Although I liked &quot;Scream Bloody Gore&quot;, I think this and &quot;Spiritual Healing&quot; totally are the best, killer old school Death Metal, Half Scream Half Growl vocals, killer riffs and leads, kick ass double bass, this album will make you want to rip someones throat out.
078322608X|4.0|This is definitely a movie that needs to be watched from start to finishe with no interruptions.  I really did not like this movie years ago when it first came out, but I decided to watch the movie again.  The story line is cnofusing the first time you watch it but definitely interesting, and it has a good twist at the end of the movie.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|I must admit, I no longer buy cd's anymore but download it legally from iTunes, where I have the power to choose the songs I like in an album, and I loved every track in this fantastic album.  When I first heard of Alicia Keys, I didn't understand what the big hype was about.  I thought her first album wasn't very good.  I thought she had the talent but the debut album was borderline pop.  Perhaps Quincy Jones had too much of an influence; the album seemed too simplistic, made ready for the MTV audience.  Whatever the case, her lyrics have matured somewhat but her style of delivery has changed immensely.  This is the best R&amp;B/hip-hop album I've heard since Lauryn Hill's Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.  The 1st track, &quot;harlem's nocturne&quot; hooks you in as she prepares you with the events that's about to unfold, delivering a pulsating piano rhythm as Alicia welcomes you into her diary.  There's not a track wasted in this wonderful album.  From the playful talking on her cell phone of &quot;You don't know my name&quot; to the piano playing in the background that sounds like water cascading through stream, I was transported back to the sounds of the sixties and seventies of Gladys Knight, Marvin Gaye and Curtis Mayfield, but with a modern hip-hop style.  I really liked the addition of a violin to the track, &quot;karma&quot;, which gave it more layers to the traditionally strong bass and drum rhythm.  Kudos to &quot;Heartburn&quot; with the addition of horns.  Although many songs have strong energy derived from the drum and base rhythm, there are several ballads such as &quot;If I ain't got you&quot; and &quot;When you really love someone&quot; that are delivered with elegant piano playing with playful and soulful singing by Alicia.  Soul is something that you feel and not something that's just produced for the sound and I feel her emotion on these beautiful tracks.  It's rare these days in the midst of MTV-lead pop and rap domination on subjects of the bling bling and the art of being cool, that an album can produce much emotion from a listening experience, but this album delivers that, and more, especially on the ballads.  Even on the track, &quot;So simple&quot; - a favorite when I workout - the piano works as a smooth over-layer on the pulsating drum and bass line.  If you long for the R&amp;B/Soul style of the late 60's and early 70's; the greatest period in its' genre, fusing with the style of modern hip-hop, adding a touch of jazz and classical instruments: this is the album for you!  An extremely polished album that deserves every accolade that comes along the way, I love listening to this album with my iPod in tow.
B000002UB3|3.0|The best Beatles album to be released since A Hard Day's Night, with Abbey Road the Beatles attempt to catch up with the musical times that had passed them by during the Sgt. Pepper and Magical Mystery Tour years.  This is a great effort that has some gems on it, especially by Harrison, but the McCartney songs hold the album back somewhat overall.
B0000E1ALR|4.0|A much more in-depth retrospective than 'Greatest Hits' for those who aren't already die-hard fans. You could think Columbia could give us a little more, though, in terms of supporting material. How about more liner notes from Springsteen for all three CDs, not just the one disk? Interviews with some of the old band members? Hard to complain about the song list, though. The third CD is the only one of interest for the die-hards, with the standouts &quot;From Small Things ...&quot; and &quot;County Fair.&quot; If you're a Springsteen nut, you'll feel a little guilty over spending $20+ for just one disc, but you figure you have to, right? If you're new to the Springsteen game, this is the first thing to get. But please do us all a favor and go buy the real albums, too.<br />And Bruce, if you're listening, I think we're full-up on complilations for a while. In less than 10 years, we've had a box set of unreleased or nearly unreleased material (&quot;Tracks&quot;), a Greatest Hits package, a live album, (&quot;Live from New York City&quot;), TWO DVDs (&quot;New York City,&quot; and &quot;Barcelona&quot;) and now this. And by my count, just two albums of completely new material (&quot;Ghost of Tom Joad&quot; and &quot;The Rising&quot;). I know you've got the kids to raise and husband duties and all that, and we love the tours, but please, we want new stuff to memorize!
B000002E5J|5.0|I miss the old Shakira, she used to be original and fresh. since her english debut and her &quot;blond&quot; hair is not the same anymore. I hope she release another great album like this one.
B00005JLWN|5.0|What a terrific movie!  Equilibrium embraces exactly what would happen if we couldn't feel.  Christian Bale can act!  This man reels you in and keeps you hooked through the whole movie. I felt really connected with him and felt all the emotions!  This is only 1 of 3 movies that I own that when I put it on I have to sit and watch it.<br />What a great movie!
B00009TB5G|5.0|The Two Towers is truly a great movie. The extended edition may be long but it is great. The acting was excellent. I loved the Helm's Deep part. The special features are great too. Peter Jackson really has done a great job on these movies. Elijah Wood did a great job as Frodo even though he ws pretty mean to Sam. Sean Austin did a great job portraying Sam who had too put up with Frodo. The battles scenes were the best I've ever seen. I highly recommend this film.
0140135154|1.0|Berger isn't making artistic observations as much as social commentary.  He gives not-so-subtle hints that he's basically a communist and talks about how European Art serves the purposes of the elite (from feudalism to capitalism) to oppress &quot;the majority.&quot;  There is even an entire chapter talking about art oppressing women.<br />That said, I see three ways people would refer to this book:<br />#1 - People who hold a similar (or the same) position,  these would point to this book as an authoritative statement to prove their position<br />#2 - People who hold the opposite position, these people would just pass it off and meaningless propaganda<br />And finally, the way I came at it:<br />#3 - As a academic work<br />And it is the failure to survive as an academic work that requires me to rate this book poorly.  First I must say, I was interested in hearing how Berger would argue his position, so please don't simply accuse me of disregarding the book because I don't agree with the thesis.<br />Basically, Berger takes some observations from Art History, formulates his thesis, and then fails to give ANY argumentation for his thesis.  That is what I find unforgivable.  No doubt people will point to certain passages as his 'argument.'  But any such passages are nothing but references back to the works that helped Berger formulate his thesis.  At best one could call this further explanation of his theory, at worst you can accuse him of circular reasoning.  Because of this, I was tempted to throw the book across the room many a time while reading it.<br />Finally, I'm forced to label this book as pseudo-academic and give it the lowest recommendation possible.
B00000F5KH|4.0|I had always thought that U.S. writers would stick to the roadtrip (e.g., &quot;On the Road&quot;) and the Latins would stick to magical realism.  I've been happily surprised by the results of their poaching on the American genre.  Recently I watched &quot;Y Tu Mama Tambien&quot; and found it excellent.  Like YTMT, &quot;Central Station&quot; is cut in the classic mold of the roadtrip, where transformation flows from the trip itself and the characters met on it.  This movie come highly recommended.  Its only detraction is the ending, which could have occurred in any of the last three scenes and which was a little too melodramatic.
B0000DBJ2B|4.0|This movie is one of my favorites, but there just wasn't enough &quot;extra&quot; features to justify the Collector's Edition price.
B00005JME0|4.0|this movie is great. the polt, story its all good. maybe the actings a little...but besides that its very good. Its that kinda movie that leaves you thinking after you leave the theater. see, you also gotta pay attention to whats goin on. you can't take bathroom breaks! lol  because if you leave the theater for even 5 or then minutes you'll lose track of whats goin on. There are sum parts that are a little confusingm so you have to pay attention. im about to go see it again
B0000DD7LB|4.0|This cd is Britney Spears best cd. It has different kinds of genres, pop, rnb, hiphop, dance, reggae, except rock, country, and rap that this album doesn't have. The best songs are Touch of my hand, Shadow, Toxic, The Hook up, and so on, they are all good. Although Britney's voice is not that good, but voice is not everything. It's your style that counts and Britney has a really good style. If it was only voice, then Christina Aguilera would have been selling 10 million copies. Music also deals with the sound of your songs, not only your voice. If you have good voice and your sound is boring then you wouldn't be selling anything. Christina has no other talent apart from her voice. She can't dance, she's a lousy performer, and the sound of her music is boring. But Britney Spears always have good beats and hot sounds in her music, both fast songs and slow songs. Look at Everytime- it is one of the most unique ballad i've ever heard, it has a very cool sound. Christina is using her voice to out do Britney Spears, but she sucks in other things. Britney Spears overall is a very great performer. I recommend this album to everyone including Britney's haters. Give this album a try, you'll love it. I give this album 4 stars because the one star missing is Britney's voice. If she had a voice like Christina or at least Madonna, then I would immidiately give it 5 stars. I wonder where Britney would be right now if she had a good voice. I mean her voice is not bad, it's ok. She just need a good voice to back up the cool beats in her music. Those Britney haters who give this album one star have never heard it before.
B00009TB5G|5.0|This movie is heroic in every sense of the world.  It's a heroic fantasy, it's of heroic proportions, it stirs heroic feelings in the viewers... and it takes a heroic effort of will to sit through the whole thing at once, because it's just so huge.<br />The extended version of The Two Towers fills in many of the details that didn't translate from the book to the theatrical release.  Not everything is here, of course, since not everything that works in a book would look good in a movie.  Some lines have been reassigned--a speech by Tom Bombadil comes out of Treebeard's mouth, a Gandalf speech comes from Grima Wormtongue--and many narrative events have been streamlined to fit on two DVDs.  But enough is here to satisfy most purists.<br />One problem is the increased role for Liv Tyler as Arwen.  I've never been all that impressed with Tyler, and the struggle to give her more face time distracts from the actual narrative thrust.  Thankfully, these additions aren't so big that they anchor this otherwise dynamic film.<br />The casting, direction, and location work is to die for, of course, and it more than justifies the unbelievable audience loyalty and high monetary reward the film series has earned.  Like the second Star Wars film, The Empire Strikes Back, this second film of a trilogy uses its status as a bridge between stories to its best advantage.  Without the sluggishness of introducing the characters or the anticlimax of conclusion, this may even be the most consistently good movie of the three.<br />Blessed with casting coups, heroic action, and some of the most beautiful visuals in recent memory, this DVD is easily equal to all the hype you've heard.
B000002RXS|5.0|Read Prosper Merimee's Carmen-Novella and you'll hear where Callas got her inspiration from. Callas isn't a pretty girl toying with her skirts but a FIERY gypsy whose voice was BURNING with strange eroticism and a fatal thirst for freedom and life. In 1964 Callas voice had matured and her mezzo-range is simply astonishing (For more proof of this satin-like, sexy sound listen to her \\"Pleurez mes yeux\\" or her siren-like recordings of Dalilah's arias). Of course Callas sounds like no other Carmen, she can't be compared to anyone. This is an EVIL Carmen, a she-devil, as Don Jos puts it: A DEMON! A brilliant addition to the gorgeous recording with de los Angeles as Carmen. (Also with Gedda as Don Jos) A MUST BUY!
B00004BZ0N|5.0|More focused than The White Album, this is probably among the best double albums in rock history.  The transition between songs is handled superbly and a lot of ground is covered, from rockabilly to reggae to soul.  The album loses a bit of momentum toward the end (tracks 15-17), but it is regained with the excellent final two tracks, \\"Revolution Rock\\" and \\"Train in Vain.\\"  Sure, Mick Jones and Joe Strummer's vocals are rough and unpolished, but that's the whole idea.  Don't trust anybody who doesn't snap their fingers to this one.
B00005JLRT|1.0|What more can be said about the TNG cast that hasn't already been said? (Good or Bad.) All I can say is as a casual fan of ST I only know what I see and the bottom line is The TNG cast has destroyed this awesome franchise. No question about it. Since the premier of the first TNG Episode to the end of this movie they have managed to only, poorly, imitate the original cast. <br />I respect Gene Roddenberrys vision and I know that he would frown on this movie. No doubt. The TNG movies have done nothing but rip off the original cast movies by repackaging and recycling old ideas and presenting them as new. THIS MOVIE is a perfect example. This movie is just a remake of ST II The Wrath of Khan...bottom line. Don't waste your money. Spend your money on the original. Borrow this movie from a friend or something but don't buy into this recycled, unoriginal, broken down, TNG series. <br />TNG has never been original. They used some of the old cast for Generations because they had no clue how to be original. They stole the Time travel idea from ST IV for First Contact and now they have remade ST II. Don't buy into it. You will only encourage the suits in Hollywood to make more unoriginal junk like this. <br />However, judging by the box office receipts on this movie, alot of people stayed away, so that is encouraging! And I have to thank the TNG Cast for failing so miserably with their movies because this means they have ruined it for the Voyager cast. So hopefully we won't have to sit through any Voyager movies thanks to the destruction laid out by TNG! Who knows what Original cast plot lines Voyager would have stolen?<br />I do like Brent Spiner and Patric Stewart...when they are not making ST movies or tv episodes.
0920668372|2.0|Sorry guys, I just don't think this book is very good.  I'm not sure that I can agree with the \\"incest\\" angle that some reviewers have taken, I just didn't enjoy it.  FOr one thing, it's sappy.  It plays on too many stereotypes.  AND every woman I know has gotten at least one or two copies at their babyshower.  For my money?  Buy Owl Babies instead.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|That's one of things you'll learn the meaning of from this enjoyable Joss Whedon ( Buffy,  Angel) production. Throw out  your concept of a Science Fiction series, because it isn't about the alien of the week or big space battles, heck it only has one episode with a laser gun. It's a well written, character driven, thought provoking tv show about people who are just trying to make ends meet, not rule the galaxy, nor explore strange new worlds...even though there's nothing wrong with that. Bottom line is you'll love this series and wonder what momentary lapse of judgement occured at Fox to let this gem of a series go down the tubes.
1401300901|4.0|Yep, hats off to cecelia, she did well!i must admit i really enjoyed this book...actually stayed up until half 3 in the mornin to finish it!now i love my tear-jerkers which is why this lost a star...i was only reeeally moved by the last letter...and yes my eyes welled up but not the tears they're accustomed to in their other old favourites, usually by maeve binchy!!<BR>but it was a really good read...although the way the documentary took off is just a tad unrealistic!!<BR>anyway...thats my opinion!
B00007MB4I|4.0|This is very different. Some cracking tracks and some good tracks. Deffinately not everybodys cup of tea but I like varied styles of music and this is one of those cases. From the startling dynamics of the first track to the harmonies on the last tracks this keeps you interested. Recording wise it gets 50-92% and music it gets 85%.
0793518326|2.0|You pick it up and think, wow!, this is great.  Then you read a couple of pages and realize you can get better stuff for free off the internet.  Here is what you can expect:<BR>1. Pages are way too small.  You'll be flipping endlessly just doing one song.<BR>2. Font is way too small.  Invest in a high-powered magnifying glass if you plan on reading it.  Don't even think about reading it in dim light.<BR>3. Font is some goofy script and often illegible. Couldn't they just use arial?<BR>4. Mistakes abound.<br />About the only good thing I can say is that they usually get you close enough that you can figure it out.  But at this price, it should be accurate.<BR>Hal Leonard, shame on you.
B0000897DH|4.0|Billy Preston almost steals the spotlight from Eric Clapton on his One More Car, One More Rider DVD with his infectious smile and swirling Hammond B3 sounds. On the Concert for Bangladesh he absolutely brings the house down with &quot;That's The Way God Planned It&quot;. This and &quot;Jumpin Jack Flash&quot; is worth the price alone.
B00005NP04|5.0|I really like this CD, Martina is one of the few women doing real COUNTRY and WESTERN music out there today instead of pop and bluegrass (How CMT could rank Allison Krauss and Patty Loveless over her I have no idea?). The selections are excellent (Although I think &quot;Keeping My Distance&quot; should have been on it), and I am glad to see some light hearted music on it such as &quot;When God Fearin Women Get The Blues&quot; and &quot;Happy Girl&quot;. Country has become much to serious for many people's tastes (I think the artist's pay too much attention to the critics (Toby Keith and George Strait are exceptions)and think everything has has to be different and serious, forgetting that the greats (Such as Patsy Cline and Hank Williams) did light stuff too). This is probably the best single disk greatest hits CD of a current artist you can get (Not up there with Strait Out Of The Box though). So go get this CD, you will like it, and if you listen carefully to her lyrics, you will fall in love with her music.
B00005JMCT|2.0|I won't go into any great detail about the movie.  I felt that it was bad.  Even the editing was poor--scenes were cut in the middle of actor's lines.<br />The DVD quality is horrible.  The colors are over-saturated and the wrong hue, and detail in the blacks is crushed.  Overall a dark transfer with bright orange skin color.
B000002513|5.0|I will admit that I bought this album for &quot;Rosalita&quot; initially, as I'm sure a lot of fans did. See, I was introduced to Bruce from &quot;Born to Run&quot; on, so I had no idea that the man had more treasures in his collection just waiting for me to find. When I heard &quot;Rosalita&quot; on the Bruce Anthology video, I was hooked and it immediately became my favorite performance on the tape. It was raw, enthusiastic, and beautiful all in one. I had never wished that I could go back in time so much...just to be at one concert to have the fun that Bruce was having while performing that one song. Of course, I had to buy this album and &quot;Greetings...&quot; immediately.<br />After getting my fill of &quot;Rosie&quot; over and over again, I decided to let the whole album play and wow... This is definitely is what rock &amp; roll is all about--the energy, the innocence, the passion, the rough edges and the over the top instrumental riffs. When you listen to this album, it makes you feel like you stumbled into a bar at exactly the right moment--when their star performer took the stage. And Bruce and the band would entertain the crowd into the morning just because they could and they loved it. The rousing instrumentals often seem like they were just the improvisations of a live show or that maybe they were competing behind the scenes to steal the show with an anthemesque riff. But...it tends to be difficult to steal a show away from you know who.<br />I definitely think this album was titled perfectly. Bruce never again would have the wild and wide-eyed perspective and the innocence of a young boy trying to have a good time while making a name for himself in the desolate streets of Jersey. I guess maybe this album could be called Bruce's &quot;going away party&quot; because it sometimes feels that way. Even though I wasn't even alive during the making of this record--my bad luck--I get a sentimental feeling just listening to this record. It takes me back to his world...when music was this good. I think this record defines what rock &amp; roll should be--no frills, no gimmicks, just plain ol' Bruce giving shows to die for.s world...when music was this good. I think this record defines what rock &amp; roll should be--no frills, no gimmicks, just plain ol' Bruce giving shows to die for.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|In an era of \\"dumbed down\\" television and reality shows Firefly offers an excellent example of what television could be. This series contains everything a person could want in a quality television program, from action and adventure, to comedy and romance.  Unfortunately this series was given an unfair chance by the Fox network.  The first episode of the series gave much background and provided an excellent opening, however due to the intervention of Fox executives this was the last episode ever aired.  Also contributing to the poor ratings is the tendency of Fox to have inconsistent scheduling from week to week.<br />One of the most appealing aspects of this show was the ability of the story lines to remain in the realm of possibility. The common description of this series as a \\"Space Western\\" may be partially correct; however the western feel may be more a side effect of what the harsh life at the far reaches of space would likely involve, than it is an intentional goal of Firefly's writers.  Another excellent feature of the show is that it respected the laws of physics.  This was demonstrated by the difficulties the crew encountered while traveling through space, and the fact that the show had no sound effects for scenes in outer space.  While accuracies like these may seem to be small points, they really help the viewer to not feel like they are simply watching another show dumbed down for the masses.<br />This series had a fascinating style for presenting scenes to the viewer.  While hard to imagine, the intentionally imperfect camera work turned the series into a work of art.  The unconventional use of different camera angles, misfocusing, zooming, and intentionally misframed shots gave the viewer the sense of actually being in the action.  This is far different from the perfect, sterilized, removed shots that could be expected from a show like \\"Star Trek\\".  Also amazingly the creators continued using intentional imperfections in computer generated scenes, which blended perfectly with the rest of the show and furthered the feeling of being in the action.<BR>Obviously a show cannot succeed on its technical aspects alone.  <br />Every episode of Firefly delivers an amazing story, often complicated and full of plot twists.  With nine characters all contributing an important role, the series possesses an endless ability to keep the viewer mesmerized.
B00008ADPF|5.0|Nickelback's The Long Road is the best CD, hands down. The songs are awesome, they have meaning, and Chad Kroeger has a gorgeous voice. The first two singles are kick butt and the rest of the tracks are great. My three favorite unreleased tracks are 2, 5, and 11. You have to give this CD a try!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Stephen Schwartz is a wonderful composer and lyricist, behind such shows as &quot;Pippin&quot; and &quot;Godspell.&quot; He has created another great show in &quot;Wicked.&quot; The score is great, with catchy tunes as well as powerful songs. &quot;Popular&quot; is particulary catchy, as is &quot;The Wizard and I&quot; and &quot;Dancing Through Life.&quot; &quot;No One Mourns the Wicked,&quot; &quot;No Good Deed,&quot; and the incredible &quot;Defying Gravity&quot; add to this awesome soundtrack. The plot is facinating, and the music tells the story in a remarkable way. Th cast, headed up by Kristin Chenoweth, Idina Menzel, Joel Grey and Norbert Leo Butz make this truly pleasing to listen to. You should definitely purchase this CD- you will not regret it!
B000089RVX|3.0|Some people think that this album is overrated.  NOT ME, although they have been a tad overplayed on the radio.  I am not some hard core fan of Evanescence nor Miss Amy (although they have received MUCH PUBLICITY).  I enjoyed the whole album, especially &quot;My Immortal&quot; &amp; &quot;Tourniquet&quot;.  The members of Evanescence are up for several Grammys &amp; while I don't necessarily think that Evanescence is high caliber, I certainly wouldn't begrudge them a &quot;Best New Artist&quot; grammy over some of the other nominees that are less deserving... If you like Tori Amos, The Cranberries, Poe or Fiona Apple, you WILL enjoy this album.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Don't waste your time. THis movie is dull, dull, dull - a perfect example of navel gazing by Sofia Coppola. Thank god for Bill Murray - he saved the movie. Scarlett JOhannsen gave her usual uninspired performance - this girl is SUCH a terrible actress that I squirmed every time she was on the television staring vacantly off into space and pursing her huge lips. Blech. don't waste your time.
0345457684|3.0|I think the true sign of the quality of this book is that 2 months after reading it, i couldn't remember the title, much less the plot. That being said, it was an okay book. The setting was interesting but not that much different from a million other cyberpunk worlds. The characterization was okay but none of the characters were truly memorable. The tech had one or two novel ideas but nothing mind-blowing. And the mystery at the center of the plot ultimately turned out to be kind of sordid. Yes, the writing was solid, but ultimately you want more out of good sci-fi, no? I'll keep on searching for the next breakout sci-fi author.
B00008VPUP|5.0|This is an excellent Movie.  This dvd is spectacular!  Tons of extras.  I think you should buy it right now.  The animation, sound and music was fabulous.  However, I do agree with the other reviewers.. &quot;Morning Report&quot; was just terrible.  The only think I liked was watching Simba pounce around..
B000068MKZ|5.0|What an unbelievable relaxed laidback album. Carla's whispering sexy voice makes you feel like wandering through France on a beautiful day in May. just lovely...Buy this!!!!!
B00006G8G1|2.0|Before I say anything about the live DVD version of Iron Maiden's ROCK IN RIO, I must say this: &quot;Steve Harris, you're a unique bass player, good songwriter, and metal legend - please stay out of the editing room, thank you!!&quot;  More on that later.  After being blown away by the double-CD version of ROCK IN RIO, I was really expecting a lot out of the filmed concert.  The band's performance is tight and singer Bruce Dickinson has never sounded better than he does here.  So how come all that energy comes through in the CD but not on the DVD?  Simple: there's too much going on and there's so little time to show it all.  <br />For one thing, the sound is absolutely atrocious compared to the CD version.  On the CD, the production was raw but very listenable and every vocal and instrument could be heard well, including the crowd.  On the DVD, the sound is cranked up way past 11 and becomes hugely unlistenable.  I couldn't really tell what was going on; it was just one big sonic whirlwind of noise and nothing else.  As I mentioned in the intro, bass player and band leader Steve Harris did the editing, and you can clearly tell this guy didn't go to film school.  The editing is very fast, very choppy, very flawed, and extremely headache-inducing.  I swear, I thought I was gonna have a seizure midway through the concert!  And whenever someone solos, whether it be Adrian, Janick, or Dave, the editing doesn't pause long enough to see either them work their magic on the fretboards.  Very disappointing.  Not since the movie ARMAGEDDON have I seen so many annoying 2-second cuts.<br />The DVD isn't entirely all bad.  Some of the more intimate songs like &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; and &quot;Fear of the Dark&quot; really showcase Maiden's love for the crowd and their love back, with brief slowed down edits (finally!).  And watching Bruce Dickinson hop over the speakers, climb to the top of the stage set, and sing his heart out into every song is truly something to behold, proving he's one of rock's greatest and unsung frontmen.  The special features are pretty cool as they show the Maiden members doing un-rock &amp; roll things, like fencing, playing golf, or going to a soccer game.  Nicko has his own spot, and appears in Dave Murray's bit, which is pretty funny.<br />But all that cannot save the fact that the awesome Rock in Rio performance has been ruined in the hands of Harris.  God, Steve what were you thinking?  Overall, if you had to choose between the double CD or the double DVD, stick with the CD.  It sounds a lot better and your mind won't turn to mush by watching Harris' hyperactive editing.  Maiden are still a great live band, but the ROCK IN RIO DVD does not do them justice.
B00005Y7L4|5.0|I'll start by saying that my appreciation for japanese cinema is limited.  This is due to my own lack of patience, not acceptence of its intrinisic differences from American cinema.  I like Kurosawa, have seen them all but I wouldn't likely watch them again.  I like anime but wouldn't go out of my way to watch it (although the current Teen Titans cartoon is very anime style and I'm finding that I do like it).  The japanese monster movies were good when I was a kid.  But that's about it for my appreciation of japanese cinema.  If you're a snob about it, well, sorry but it is my review.<br />I bought Battle Royale on a self-dare...I challenged someone online to find me a movie that I would love that was shocking and relevent.  He told me to get Battle Royale.<br />Again...what a remarkable movie. Its accessible easily by western aesthetics and sensibilities, but at the same time, it is sit-on-the-edge-of-your-seat good.  If you are looking for an easy movie to watch, look further.  This isn't easy but its very worthwhile and it is one I will not only revisit, but whose novel (on which the movie is based) has already been ordered.
B00007ELF2|5.0|This movie is great, the lighting and story line seem to be thought out very well. The actors did a wonderful job, there happened to be quite a few stars in this movie. I had one problem though... How realistic is this movie? The shoot out seemed over-exaggerated. I've never seen a shoot out in San Diego before. The movie made it sound like drugs are all over the place here. They are probably right somewhat, but you don't notice it too much. What city doesn't have drug problems? This is nothing new. Otherwise, this movie is great. One of the points of the movie that I like is that drug use can effect anyone in any city at any time.
B00008ADPF|1.0|One word sums this album up -BORING!!!! , the same repetitve power chords , dull vocals , and strained lyrics which is to say typical Nickelback , anyway it is not NOT worth the price so if you like this music wait till this album goes into the bargin bin . If you want real Hard Rock/meatal go treat yourself to an AC/DC , Guns N Roses or Iron Maiden album !
0380789035|2.0|Neil Gaiman is beyond his depth in this novel.  He simply can't write a successful or substantial novel yet.  He still needs the padding of comic illustrations.  He writes excellent short stories, but hasn't mastered the art of writing a book.  The editor should have cleaned up and shortened the book as it rambles and tends to veer off into plot developments that don't add anything to the story.  The premise of the book was very interesting, but the execution lacks clarity, character development, and suspense.  I found myself not caring about the main character, as he seemed a bit dim-witted and uninteresting.  The &quot;American Gods&quot; that littered the chapters were cartoon sketches of beings that should have had more spiritual mystery or meaning.  I found this book hard to finish, at the end I simply didn't care about the resolution of the story.
B000000OQF|5.0|Simply put this is the greatest debut album EVER!! , all the songs 1-12 are dynamite riffs and solo's are everywhere and are all phenomanal ( Slash and Stradlin are an amazing tandem ) The bass playing is so good ( thanks Duff ) Axl's vocals are first rate as is Adler's drumming . Let's get to the Highlights of this album &quot;Welcome to the Jungle &quot; , &quot;Paradise City &quot; , Sweet Cild o Mine &quot; are the three big hits so let's get to the other gems &quot; Mr.Brownstone &quot; &quot;RocketQueen&quot; and &quot;Nightrain&quot; coulda been singles as well . Anyway if you are a rock fan and don't already own this you should get you're head checked take a heavy dose Of &quot; Appetite for Destruction&quot; and call me when you wake up , ENJOY !!!
B000059QY3|5.0|I watched this on TV many years ago, and watched over and over again and I'm sure this was very sensational for opera fans and musicians.  When Sir Georg Solti died I was so sad because I wanted to go to his opera. The difficult things about opera is that it should be great in both music and also drama (act).This is perfect in both. Gheorghiu was especially good. I cannot find better &quot;La Traviata&quot; than this. This is my favorite!
B00007LTIB|5.0|As you leaf through yes's catalog, you see a few things, such as strange abstract drawings and albums that have an average of 4 songs. Yes is not the band for a person who doesn't like complex music,especially this album and tales from topographic oceans. The fact is, however, Yes is a brilliant band. They built up their credibility with easier but equally great albums such as The Yes Album and Fragile. Then they dived in head first experimenting with the excellent Close To The Edge. Then, they made the controversial TFTO. Relayer is basically all of the great elements of TFTO made into a record, with a whole lot of jazz influence and of course Yes from the past. The 22 minute Gates Of Delirium is just such a brilliant piece, and Sound Chaser and To Be Over follow suit. Of course, I'd say start with The Yes Album and build yourself up, but this along with Close To The Edge are the band's best two records. Absolutely essential.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Lost In Translation is by far the best film of 2003.  It captures the emotion of two American's in Tokyo who are not only totally worn physically, but also emotionally worn.  They find something in one another that once existed in their lives, but seems to have deflated.  And the unfortunate thing is that even though they have their moments, they can only last so long.  Reality will come creeping up, but the memory, however, will linger on forever.  A complete exercise in non-verbal communication, Lost In Translation is akin to those films that leave you wanting more, but satisfaction is attained through the memory of the good times and replay.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Radiohead can do no wrong. They keep getting better with each new release.<br />'2=2=5' kicks off the album to a dizzying start with it's frenetic pace. 'There there', the lead off single is soothing and refreshing with Thom sounding relaxed, contrary to the general mood of the cd which is one of fear and terror.<br />'Where I end and you begin', another magical number, upbeat and beautiful. This is followed by the surprisingly beautiful yet dirge like 'We suck young blood' that has Thom wailing and warbling.<br />'I will' is a beautiful ballad. 'A punchup at a wedding', and 'A wolf at the door', the latter with it's spoken lyrics, are other highlights in this outstanding cd.<br />Lashings of rock and electronica abound to give a style only Radiohead can carry off.  Brilliant!!
0375410341|5.0|The book is intricately detailed, and being as abstract as the overall concept is - a book about a documentary and various other resources, which in fact don't exist - it is marvelously executed, and while it's hard to get into, once you get over the hump you'll no doubt find it hard to stop turning the pages.
B00006HBUB|5.0|First of all I think they did a great job with this movie.  It follows closely with the cartoon and fans will not be disappointed.  The actors are excellent and fit the parts very well and the storyline is actually pretty good.  When I first watched this movie I had my doubts, I thought it would be stupid and they would never be able to make a good Scooby.  Scooby was great and they did a great job with his animation and personality.  I recommend old fans and people who aren't fans to watch this movie.
B00000373U|5.0|I first became aware of Elliott because of the subconscious, melodic haunting he gave my ears while watching Good Will Hunting. Who is that singing those songs, I wondered. Buying this album and listening to it once caused me to instantly purchase all of his other work...at the same time.<BR>Elliott's brooding quality goes beyond mere youthful angst or market-driven &quot;shunned rock star&quot; imaging. His abilities are rare in some of the greatest poets and rarer still in modern songwriters. It's as if his whispering voice were born from the strings of the guitar he so brilliantly plays. Never in the history of music has a singer sounded so perfectly balanced with so little instrumental accompaniment.<BR>Elliott's entire work is the most consistently beautiful collection of music ever created. Pay his life tribute by listening to him.
0385504209|5.0|What a wonderful read.  I enjoyed this book tremendously and have recommended it to several friends.  This is one of those books that I will be reading again.
B00008ADPF|1.0|What can be said to all the VH1 drones and the Clear-Channel zombies that swear by this music to get them to see the light?? Go back 20 years and ask your rockin' parents how &quot;cool&quot; Toto, Survivor, Asia, Night Ranger, and all the rest of those &quot;artists&quot; were. You'll get the idea of how bands like Nickelback, Train, and Matchbox 20 will be regarded, if they even PLAY this stuff on the radio in 20 years!!<BR>TURN OFF THE VH1! TURN OFF YOUR CLEAR-CHANNEL WORLD DOMINATION RADIO! Take your pimply butts down to the local indie music shop (or order it here) and pick up Muse, Supergrass, Mercury Rev, Flaming Lips, Turin Brakes, etc... 5 years from now when you're finally living and enjoying life, you won't have to deny that you were into these bands like you will for Nickelback!! HELL, listen to some Heavy Metal (UP THE IRONS!) if ya have to!!<BR>THE END IS COMING FOR THESE BANDS!! And if ya don't believe me, tell me where Vertical Horizon, Lifehouse, Third Eye Blind, and Nine Days is these days...<BR>AND, to all the soccer moms and unnamed &quot;music fans&quot; who have and will complain about this review, TAKE A PILL! This review wasn't meant for you, anyway. You're obviously already sucked into the Clear Channel, &quot;corporate-rock&quot; brigade to DESERVE to listen to Supergrass; stick to your Toad The Wet Sprocket and Barenaked Ladies cd's instead. I suppose they need to eat too...
B000002UAR|5.0|While Sgt. Peppers surely showcased the Fab Four at their peak in songwriting and production, this album was the true indication that they were about to take us all into a completely new compartment of our brains.  Gone were the &quot;fillers&quot; like &quot;Run for your Life&quot; on Rubber Soul.  Every song on Revolver is exquisite and unique.  Of course, rating a Beatles album is like comparing 20-carat diamonds but this one truly is special in that George Martin finally loosened up and let these musical adventurers try any and all things that came into their heads.  In short, 3-minute bursts they broke into and redistributed our established notions of what songs should sound like, lyrics read like and album art should look like, changing the world forever.  For those who weren't there when it happened I can only assure you that they didn't have to disrobe at the Super Bowl to shake the very foundations of society.
B00005RDSM|5.0|The day my dad bought me this tape back in april 1993, I  instantly fell in-love with it. And while it was only the third addition to my Disney collection back then (following &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; &amp; &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;), today, having over 20 Disney films in my library, it still remains one of my favorite Disney movies ever.<BR>I loved everything about this film, but mostly the glossy animation. It reminds me of that in &quot;Cinderella&quot;. Very pristine, very detailed, amazing colors. Equally important, the characters are very appealing, especially Tinker-Bell and the evil-yet-hilarious Captain Hook. Wendy is also a great character, drawn very beautifully. The story of &quot;Peter Pan&quot; has always interested me, and therefore I had high expectations upon watching this movie for the first time. I remember watching it with my sisters; we were totally blown away by it. It's easily a classic in a league of its own.
0452282152|4.0|This is one of those instances when the book, though very good, is not quite as good as the movie. The movie succeeds in distilling the emotional essence of a very visual story about a very uncommunicative protagonist. These two features--visual story and uncommunicative protagonist--are ideally suited to film, the former for obvious reasons and the latter because in a movie you can read what's going on inside a character on her face. In this book's first person narrative, you must read between the lines, and make deductions based on other characters' responses to her. There are enough clues to work with in Chevalier's sparse writing, but Griet remains a bit of a dissatisfying enigma. Thus, the book fails to achieve the same emotional crescendo and climax as the movie, but it is still a wonderful read, and seems to be very true to both the psychology and the realities of 17th Century Holland.<br />For those unfamiliar with either, &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot; is essentially a speculation on the meaning of the painting of the same name, the masterpiece of artist Johannes Vermeer. The book posits the subject of the painting as a young maid who comes to work in the Vermeer household and develops a connection with the painter while getting swept up in family politics, as well as a power struggle with Vermeer's patron.
B00003CXB4|5.0|The first time I ever saw &quot;The Lion King&quot; was on September 14th 1995, the day it came out on video. Strangely, I went to all of Disney's releases from &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; to &quot;Aladdin&quot; (including rereleases of their older classics) but missed out on &quot;The Lion King&quot;. Silly me. &quot;The Lion King&quot; is a masterpiece. The film is visually amazing. Some scenes stand out in particular; such as the wild-beast stampede and the opening sequence. The movie wouldn't be completed without the powerful score and songs, composed by Hans Zimmer and Elton John, respectively. The Oscar-winning &quot;Can You Feel The Love Tonight&quot; and the ever-popular &quot;Circle Of Life&quot; are all here. The characters in this movie have also become wildly popular, especially Timon and Pumbaa. The villain, Scar, is the ultimate villian: evil and deceitful, yet wit and sarcastic. In this 2-disc special edition, the film looks like a video-game, in terms of sharpness and clearity. You won't believe of how smooth the image can be. &quot;The Lion King&quot; is a movie that deserves all the praise and success that it had gotten.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I'm sorry, but aside from Toxic, this album just plain sucks.  It is so clear that Madonna has her hand in this somehow behind the scenes, Britney's gotta be paying her a boatload of money.  It's a shame that someone so famous has absolutely no talent of her own.
0156907399|1.0|I knew I was in trouble when I read the L-O-N-G run on sentences that clogged up reading flow in just the first two pages. No one talks like that. No one thinks like that. And no one writes like that except for pretentious authors beloved by academics who have no idea what interests people outside of moldy ivory towers. Virginia Woolf committed suicide. All the more reason to avoid this book lest the contagion of her world view infect your mind and depress you. This is a dated, pretentious, dry, irrelevant novel. I am asuming that it is being pushed because it is poilitically correct to have at least one female author in the great books list. Unfortunately, this is a dead author whose works should have been allowed to die with her rather than be immortalized. In fact, while Woolf was contemplating suicide, she should have destroyed her work along with her life in a big bonfire. That would have spared us this novel that I wasted money on.

B00004W221|1.0|A gifted athelete that overcame the odds? No. A stellar career in college sports? No. An enormous desire to have a Notre Dame education? No. Rudy had an unhealthly obsession with ND football. He was not good enough to play for them. He merely wouldn't go away and so he pestered his way into a couple of plays (if that). Mind you he should be proud that he got an education at a fine university like ND but that isn't why he went there. If you want a good ND film try Knute Rockne All American. Do you want an inspirational sports story, try Brian's Song, The Pride of the Yankees or Hoosiers. These are the stories of athletes that gave it all for their team. Rudy had nothing to give so he asked the team to give it to him. Sorry, I tried to watch the movie without getting depressed but Rudy's just too pathetic.

6305558167|5.0|This film isn't perfect...in fact it seems to go beyond that kind of judgement. There is a real spark of magic here. Virtualy none of the characters are played as real people but rather they are shown as archtypes. This film is full of deep symbolism and was made with real love for the source material. Unlike most Hollywoodised medieval films there is no attempt to portray modern concepts and motivations (which is refreshing). I will be very suprised if anyone ever does a better version of the legend than this.
0920668364|1.0|This book was given to me as a gift when my daughter was born. I never read it until she was about 7 months old, and I won't be reading it again. It's very strange. I think it goes way beyond the idea of unconditional love. The mother is the focus, and appears to be more needy than the child. I prefer to read more light-hearted, fun stories to my daughter. This one just really creeped me out. If you want a book about unconditonal love, by \\"The Giving Tree\\" by Shel Silverstein. \\"Love You Forever\\" left me feeling like I'd exposed my kid to some over the top \\"Oprah\\" show
0800141601|1.0|You might think you want to get this film but believe me; you don't!  Just get Excalibur instead! Why does Hollywood insist on dumbing things down?!?!? Did they think they could better a story that has endured for over a millenium? UTTER DRIVEL. Can you imagine the outcry if another nation's folk traditions/legends etc. were treated with this kind of contempt...

B0000UJL96|5.0|I have been looking forward to this special edition release for quite some time. And I was not disappointed. The video/audio quality are flawless and the special features are actually worth watching. The only minor complaint I have with this dvd is that the menu animation is a bit silly... just play the movie for god's sake. Oh, and for some reason there is no booklet that comes with this. Not that I really care though. It still deserves the five stars though. General Chang makes me want to lose an eye so I can bolt a leather eye-patch to my skull.
0385504209|5.0|The Davinci Code is a marvel of writing.  Meticulously researched, it will leave the reader with much to &quot;discover&quot; on his own.  The way Dan Brown puts everything together into a coherent tale is truly astonishing.  If you've ever tried to create a crossword puzzle, you can appreciate how much effort was put into this book, making all the pieces fit together perfectly.  Truly amazing and highly recommended.
0440238609|5.0|This is easily the best series I have ever read. It contains battles between god and mankind, and many other elements. When I put down the third book I was sad because there was no more. A girl named Lyra is given a compass type gadget which she learns to use, it is very usefull. A Boy named Will discovers a knife which might be the coolest thing ever made in a book. This series has an amazing plot, having twist and turns and blindsiding you with the unexpected. The series has action, love, passion, and the true desire to fix the unfixable. The connection the reader has with the characters is a huge bond. This book may be a little dark for some  people, so if you want to laugh all day go read Dave Barry (A very funny guy). I could not put these down, and everyone I know says the could not either. Read these, love these, and you will agree, the best book ever written can be bought on Amazon. It's definatley HIS DARK MATERIALS.
B000002LSV|3.0|Where are the 2 charted hits &quot;Stages&quot; and &quot;Velcro Fly?&quot;  Both off the album, Afterburner, it seems odd that they're not included, especially when several soundtrack cuts and lesser-known, less successful tracks ARE included.  Shame on you boys.
B0000DYJM6|2.0|There's a reason why these numbers weren't on any CD.<BR>They're just not good enough.<BR>A dissapointed PJ-Fan.
B0000C0FJB|4.0|Wow, people really take their CD mix seriously.  Boiled down, this is a live cd and it sounds like it.  If you want studio versions of the songs don't buy this...if you want pretty close to an actual concert experience then buy this.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|Excellant album. If I Ain't Got You is my favorite song on the CD. If you don't have this CD now, I recommend you purchase it as soon as possible.
0790733226|5.0|Carl Sagan's phenomenal novel \\"Contact\\" was served justice. In this dramatic \\"Sci-Fi\\" movie, the lead character, Dr. Arroway (Jodi Foster) is presented with the penultimate challenge of pitting scientific logic and the essential human importance of religious faith in a God/higher power to live a life of meaning.  I cannot imagine this movie being nearly as significant without the excellent casting of characters. (especially Foster).  This is a tough issue to \\"sell\\" to the public and a difficult message to convey through the genius of Sagan. However, the job gets done and done well.  I reccommend seeing this video 2 or 3 times to really get the full impact of the message, or better, read Sagan's book before or after seeing the video. You will be moved and it will be on your mind for days to follow-------or longer if you are of a religious or philosophical nature. Enjoy!
B0000VD04M|5.0|This is an excellent movie, and the DVD sounds terrific! BUT does anyone know why this DVD was pulled? Any plans for re-release? Some copies are floating around, but there is no official word of what happened, any information would be terrific! I've been waiting for this DVD for a long time, great movie and the special edition features sound great! Come on disney!
B00005JGAB|5.0|If you have this cd go listen to it, and if you don't go buy it. one of the best cd's ever.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|For me, The Beatles are the most important and influencial band that the world has ever known. I listened to their music from a very early age, and I continue to do so. With that said, I think this album is great ! I love this other look at the Let It Be Album, which has no overdubs or orchestration added to it. The sound is great. And the song sequencing is pretty good as well. Here is a breakdown of each song, with a review for them.<br />Get Back - There is nothing different about this song; the mix sounds the same as the other versions of it, except that the song ends earlier, leaving out the ending part on the single version. 10/10<br />Dig A Pony - Sounds pretty much the same as on the original album, except that Billy Preston't organ is more audible. This is not an &quot;as nature intended&quot; track, since I saw the movie of the same name, and this song was recorded on the rooftop of the Apple office, and in the film, John makes a mistake on his guitar, so they edited a piece from another take over that spot, to fix it up and be polished, which is ok, i guess, because who would want to release an album with mistakes on it ? 10/10<br />For You Blue - Pretty much the same as on the original album. The mix is better on this one. The lead vocal is not live, since it is still the same one overdubbed almost a year later from when the music was recorded. It might have been ok to use the version from the film. 10/10<br />The Long And Winding Road - Ah, the song that has caused so much controversy over this album. Indeed, there are no overdubs and orchestra on this song, so this makes it sound like a totally different song, and it is in fact, because it is the version that is seen in the film, and the reason for this is because the actual &quot;naked&quot; version has already been released on Anthology 3, but it is better to use the songs as much as possible from the film, to make it an actual soundtrack 10/10<br />Two Of Us - Same as the original version. I also noticed that in the film, the ending of the song is different, so there is yet another edit on this album. 10/10<br />I've Got A Feeling - Way different from the original. There are some edits on here as well, but most of it is from the rooftop concert 10/10<br />One After 909 - Same as original, but better sound ;) 10/10<br />Don't Let Me Down - Mostly from the rooftop concert, with an edit at where John ad libs some random vocals, shown in the film 10/10<br />I Me Mine - Billy Preston and John Lennon did not play on this song, so there is cause for some overdubs on this song that was the last to be recorded by the three Beatles for 24 years. There is a different edit on here to make the song longer by extending it to have a verse repeat. 10/10<br />Across The Universe - The best version of this song. Simple and intimate 10/10<br />Let It Be - Again, some editing in this one, since it is not the same as the film all the way through, but it still sounds great. 10/10<br />Fly On The Wall Disc - The Beatles working in the studio. Nice to listen to every once in a while. Too bad they didn't decide to add the 8 minute version of Dig It and The Rooftop Concert, even though some tracks on the album are from that show, or maybe even the final Glyn Johns mix of the Get Back album, which was the original title. Oh well, that's what we have bootleggers for... 8/10<br />10 songs for every album, for a ten star band. This album is far from the main idea originally thought from the project, mainly in the track selection, but anything by The Beatles is great for me, at least. I just thought I would show people that this is not a live album, which it was intended to be, but rather, an even more cleaned up jam session, putting the best face possible on all the tracks, hence me pointing out all the edits. For people who haven't heard this album yet, go out and buy it, I really believe you will like it. For people that have, I hope you all feel the same way that I do. I suggest gettingboth the original and this release, then you can have both versions to enjoy.<br />Oh yeah, and many of us are anxiously wondering when the movie of the same name will be released on DVD. It would be great if we could hear some news about it soon, since it was supposed to come out a month after this album was released. It will not be a mistake to release this film again, believe me :)
B0000B1OGD|4.0|This was one of the least financially successful of stop-motion animation master Ray Harryhausen films, which is a shame, since it's one of the wildest and most interesting. Based on an idea by Willis O'Brien, the visual effects master on the 1933 \\"King Kong,\\" \\"The Valley of Gwangi\\" is basically a re-imagining of \\"Kong\\" as a Western. Yep, you heard that right, pardners: this is a Giant Monster meets the Western film.<br />Now come on, that's got your attention, right?<br />\\"Gwangi\\" is just a blast. Watching the mixture of cowboy antic with a lost land of dinosaurs is the ultimate Saturday morning matinee experience. The kid in you will just wake up right away and start cheering. (As for kids themselves, do you really have to ask? They'll love this!)<br />At this point in his career, Harryhausen was producing masterful effects and getting more ambitious with each film. Here he has a sequence of cowboys roping an Allosaurus (astounding!), and later a rampaging dinosaur caught in a burning cathedral. Even with today's computer effects, Harryhausen's effects have a wonderful marvel to them, a magic that CGI can't really capture. (Unless you're Peter Jackson.)<br />Like most of the films Harryhasen produced with Charles Schneer, the actual dramatics and script are a bit lacking. James Franciscus is right on the money in his part as the smooth-talking frontier huckster, but Gila Golan is wooden and terrible as his love interest. The dialogue often clunky, but don't worry -- the dinosaurs or a cowboy shoot-up are right about the corner.<BR> <BR>The DVD also contains a featurette interview with Harryhausen, where he explains how the film came to be made and talks about how he achieved the incredible \\"dino-roping\\" sequence. Your appreciation of this visual effects genius will only go up when you hear what he had to do to get this amazing scene to work.<br />Fans of plain old fun films: BUY THIS! Visual effects fans: BUY THIS! Anyone who wants to capture the feeling of beinga kid and loving dinosaurs and cowboys: BUY THIS!
B00013PHGS|3.0|Thank goodness, Air is on the right track, redeeming themselves partially after 10,000 Hz. Granted, this doesn't have the same hypnotic-blow you away effect of Moon Safari, but what album does? <br />This album will grow on you after playing a few times. The only thing sorely lacking is whoever did the vocals on &quot;All I Need&quot; from Moon Safari. She was incredible.
B0000VD04M|5.0|....this is the second dang time they have said they were going to release this movie and then pulled it. What is going on???!!!! I love this movie, but now after they did this twice I am no longer going to buy it. You can't promise something twice and then yank it from under us. No sir! I have an old VHS that I taped from cable, and that will do because I ain't giving any money for this film now! Too bad because it is one of the best films ever made, with incredible performances by Johnny Depp, Martin Landau, and Bill Murray. Oh well.
B00013PHGS|3.0|Thank goodness, Air is on the right track, redeeming themselves partially after the 10,000 Hz Legend fiasco.  Granted, this doesn't have the same hypnotic-blow you away immediately effect of Moon Safari, but what album does? <BR>My favorite track is &quot;Cherry Blossom Girl&quot;. Like &quot;Moon Safari&quot;, every track transitions to the next one very well, making it an whole album experience, instead of playing your favorite two tracks only. <br />This album will grow on you after playing a few times. The only thing sorely lacking is whoever did the vocals on &quot;All I Need&quot; from Moon Safari. She was incredible. On that note, less vocals by JB Dunckel and Nicolas Godin would have made this a 4 star album.
B000002MP2|5.0|Well, this seems to be a love-it-or-hate-it kind of album, judging by the reviews I've read.  In my humble opinion, this album is awesome.  The problem that people who hate this album seem to have with it is that all the songs sound similar.  To these people I say, &quot;welcome to the world of punk rock.&quot;  Punk rock is all about songs that sound similar.  But when compared to other punk rock albums, this one sticks out like no other, and even considering the fact that the songs sound similar, there are very distinct differences from song to song, and i guarantee that you'll love every one.
B001S86J2Q|5.0|Grease is a timeless classic, that almost everyone loves. Watching Grease on TV, or even some of the older DVD's, it looks horrible. This movie needsto be in widescreen, the \\"Pan & Scan\\" version is horrible. So when I bought my Blu Ray player this was one of the first Blu Rays I purchased. This film looks like a brand new movie. The picure is so clear its amazing. I even had my wife, who is new to the 'Widescreen\\" thing, watch it and could not believe what she was missing watching it on regular tv all these years. From the opening cartoon credits to the Summer Nights scene to the final We Go Together carnival scene, you wont believe how good this thing looks. There are things going on in the background I never noticed before. I would 100% recomend this Blu Ray to anyone.
B000050XEI|5.0|Despite what my sister says, I love Enya! This CD certainly was a bit of a surprise. It sounded like there were violins playing instead of the strange synthesizer sounds! Every time I play it, I sing along with Enya (though my voice doesn't sound at all as nice). Classical almost. A good buy!
B0000028RR|5.0|I've been a Rage fan ever since they came out with this album back in '92. Ever since then, getting hooked on the song 'Killing in the Name', it has been a pleasure just listening to the musical and lyrical genius of RatM. Their lyrics are as raw as any band ever. Their message is so strong and seems like nothing can stop them on this album. Just a great debut album.<br />1. Bombtrack - 10 - This song is great. Lyrically, Musically the guitars leading up to the mayhem is great.<BR>2. Killing In The Name - 10 - Also Great. One of the most aggresive songs, makes ya wanna break something(LOL). <BR>3. Take the Power Back - 10 - Again lyrically a masterpiece. <BR>4. Settle for Nothing - 9 - This song is very dark. But it is also very good. Slower then most of their songs. <BR>5. Bullet in The Head - 9 - This song is pretty good, very good message. <BR>6. Know Your Enemy - 10 - This maybe one of the best on the album.<BR>7. Wake Up - 10 - IMO RatM's greatest song EVER.<BR>8. Fistfull of Steel - 8 - Good song, gets old after a while, but still an agressive Rage song.<BR>9. Township Rebellion - 8.5 - Good song, lyrics are also good.<BR>10. Freedom - 10 - Great song. Prolly 2nd best on album. Great way to end the album
B00005NWM3|5.0|Usually, you can't get me to touch any kind of hard rock. After seeing all these kids driving around with their radio volume set on seismic boom, let's just say it really put me off. However, after listening to this CD, I found myself not only liking the music, but the some of the lyrics too. I especially like &quot;Never Again&quot; and &quot;How You Remind Me.&quot; In &quot;Never Again&quot; I applaud them. The line &quot;Father is a name you haven't earned yet/ You're just a child with a temper&quot; is completely correct! In &quot;How You Remind Me,&quot; I enjoy both lyrics and tune. Believe me, check it out. Like I said, I usually NEVER touch any hard rock. (though please keep the volume down. You should be able to hear it well enough without causing a 6.5 earthquake)
B00005JMTN|5.0|Once again the nominations over look a masterpiece and only nominate the score??!! this movie was so excellant. It's about a father(Albert Finney) who throughout his whole life tells these \\"tall tales\\" to his son. When his son grows up and is expecting a child of his own he wants his father to tell him the truth about these stories. and his father is amazed that his son doesnt believe they are true. the story is so much more then this but thats all im saying without giving too much away. all the cast was great finney, ewan mcgregor, and jessica lange. this is one movie i would like to see again. It is a tearjerker and i was not the only one with tears in my eyes at the end when i heard people crying around me. not to mention this is one of the few movies i have seen where the theatre applauded when it was over. nothing short of excellant.
B000089RVX|3.0|I'm not too much into hard rock. On Fallen, I rather like some of the songs like &quot;Going Under,&quot; &quot;My Immortal,&quot; Taking Over Me,&quot; and a couple others. However, I find some of the lyrics, well..... disturbing. A bit too hard with the guitars on some songs. Otherwise, it's a good CD.
B000007P9D|5.0|This is, hands down, one of the best movies ever made. I think it was Peter Lorre's first lead role. He plays a psychopath, a murderer of children in Berlin in the 20s or 30s, an era in which the underworld had as much or maybe more power in running the city as did the police and civic officials. When the police crack down on the criminals in an attempt to catch the killer (who has the city held in terror for the safety of their children), the bad guys realize that they've got to find this nut case so they can get back in business again.<BR>The movie, to me, is remarkable for how much terror and horror it can display without showing one single piece of violence. All the nasty stuff occurs off camera: a child buys a balloon, the child enters a forest with Lorre, and as the child's mother endlessly calls her name out a window overlooking a deserted street, we see the balloon rise skyward from the forest.<BR>Absolutely amazing film - and trust me: you'll never hear the music of the Peer Gynt Suite again without thinking of this film.
6305508550|5.0|Even though this is a comedy, it's pretty darn close to what happens in a corporate environment.  I know.  I've been a software engineer for 15 years for very large places like Kodak.  This is what really happens - it's just exaggerated to make it hilarious.  But it's freaking real.  This is why I gave up the big corporate life to become a freelance writer.  It's really a funny movie and most anyone who's worked in such an environment will surely identify with the ridiculous policies and red tape.
B00005JM20|3.0|While this is not exactly a &quot;good&quot; movie, it is funny.  There were moments when I laughed hysterically such as when Johnny triumphantly unmasks the Archbishop of Canterbury's derriere, only to find no tattoos.  Oliver Ford Davies who played the Archbishop was a good sport to do that scene.  Rowan Atkinson is someone I've never seen before; and I found his physical comedy to be hilarious.  Neal Purvis and Robert Wade who wrote Bond screenplays for &quot;Die Another Day&quot; &amp; &quot;The World's Not Enough&quot; actually don't make enough of a coherent plot which would have enhanced the jokes and made the picture hang together.  Greg Wise, who is known for being the father of Emma Thompson's baby, does a great cameo as Agent One.  Singer Natalie Imbruglia as Lorna Campbell is quite beautiful, but one fails to see any real connection with Atkinson.  If his nuttiness had charmed her, we might find their connection more authentic.  I really enjoyed Ben Miller as Bough, the straight man.  He has a great scene coaxing English off a coffin and out of a graveyard when they've followed the wrong hearse.  Director Peter Howitt has &quot;Laws of Attraction&quot; coming out with Julianne Moore &amp; Brosnan; I hope there's a better script there.  John Malcovich, who I understand actually lives in France, seems to concentrate more on his accent than anything else.  The DVD deleted scenes are interesting, but one can also see why there were deleted.  The little elevator chamber where unwanted dignitaries meet their demise was an interesting quirk that is cut out.  The DVD game seemed like more effort than bang for the buck, but nice try.  The coronation scene with English swinging above the throne was priceless.  While this is not a good movie, it is a very funny one.  Enjoy!
B00005JM20|5.0|I laughed so hard!  This movie was so funny!  I wasn't expecting it because it did so poorly in theaters.  <br />I think people were expecting to see an Austin Powers knockoff, which is sad.  This is an entirely different humor.  It is as if Mr. Bean takes on a few 007 qualities.<br />I think if Austin Powers didn't exist, this movie would have done wonderfully.  It's a shame the two are even being compared, they are so different.
B0000C9ZSV|5.0|On May 30 of 1970, Jimi, Mitch Mitchell and Billy Cox played two shows at the Berkeley Theater.  This disc consists of the songs played at the second show.  Parts of both shows have been available as a bootlegs for many years, some of them relatively low quality affairs, others reasonably good soundboard boots.  Both shows had some excellent playing and perhaps the best known song from these performances is that of &quot;Hear My Train a Comin'&quot; from the first show.<br />Many collectors have questioned why Experience Hendrix has chosen to only release the second show, but I'll just express my gratitude that the second show has finally seen the light of day as a commercial release.  We can for now only sit back and hope for the first show and maybe the soundcheck to be released as soon as possible.  But for now, let's consider what we have here in this release of the second show...<br />Altogether, this disc clocks in at 67 minutes and change, with eleven tunes, all of them well known to Hendrix afecianados.  They are presented here in the best sound yet - a significant step up from the best boots.  To clarify further, the sound is actually very good given its era, with decent stereo separation, dynamics and clarity, and very good dynamic contrasts.  Jimi's guitar is placed in the center, and if there is any gripe about the sound it might be that Billy's bass is down in the mix too far.<br />Sandwiched around the tune up, Jimi gives the little bit of intro that speaks volumes to me.  '70 was not just a dark year in America's history due to unrest over Viet Nam and civil rights, but also a difficult year for Jimi.  This was due to legal issues and conflicts with his management, all multiplied by his need to do new things and move on against the resistance that tried to keep him churning out the acid rock hits.  But Jimi had moved beyond those days as is shown in the song selections and delivery at the Berkeley shows.<br />After the intro, a slightly rough around the edges Pass It On (Straight ahead), is followed by Hey Baby, a true sleeper of a tune that is given an excellent run-through here.  It's such a gem, and it shows where a part of Jimi's musical future might have gone had he lived.  In my opinion, this is one of the very best live recordings of this essential tune.  Other highlights include Stone Free, I Don't Live Today and Machine Gun.<br />Of these, I Don't Live Today is very illuminating of where Jimi was at emotionally at the time.  Interviews given around the time of the performance revealed Jimi to be eagerly anticipating his future, with many exciting plans, such as the possibility of playing with Miles Davis.  But his forward look was tempered by the mood of the times and one can sense this by his introductory remarks to this classic acid-infected blues, when he says: &quot;We'd like to do a thing that's what's happening today with a lot of people.  And I'd like to dedicate it to all... all the cats that are trying to struggle that are gonna make it anyway.&quot;  The word &quot;anyway&quot; has an emphasis that shows resolve in the face of adversity and in that way, this song encapsulates much of Jimi's last year.  This is one of the better live versions of this tune, although I could have done without the profanity because it seems to dilute the song's impact.  Jimi had often dedicated this tune to the American Indian, so the Berkeley dedication was surely a sign of the times.<br />The set is closed out with a fairly fast Voodoo Chile (Slight Return) again delivered with a classic intro, where Jimi says: &quot;We hope you all got some kind of a feeling about this thing - the next thing we're gonna play and the last thing.  It goes like this - playing to keep us alive.  This is nothing but determination and so forth and so on, you know.  Knowing that you're gonna get it together.  Thank you, good night.&quot;  The song is then delivered with more drive than any of the many versions I've ever heard.  The themes throughout were consistent with how the music was delivered - with a purpose - that being to support each other during hard times and to not give up in the face of adversity.  It's all just another example of how Jimi had become a crystal clear spokesperson for the people, a leader with a vision.themes throughout were consistent with how the music was delivered - with a purpose - that being to support each other during hard times and to not give up in the face of adversity.

0385504209|1.0|If you must read this book because it is a best-seller, borrow a copy or get it from the library.  The Da Vince Code is actually a screen play in disguise and can only be palatable as a visual romp through France and England in pursuit of The Holy Grail. The premise is unbelievable, the plot adolescent, and the conclusion ridiculous. Religious scholars and thoughtful readers alike will find this book contrived and preachy.  I found it ludicrous that a publisher would publish anything so silly or that readers would pay to read it. I only gave it one star because that was as low as the ratings go.
B0001611DI|5.0|This is the one where they hold out in a mall. Good storyline as far as these stories go. Lots of gore & guts. Just what your looking for. I'm first in line to buy this one on DVD.

B000002KDG|2.0|I can tolerate stoner Neil Young sometimes drifting off at the microphone, as he does on many of the sleepy songs on this half-baked record.  What I can't tolerate, however, is him ripping off the line that Def Leppard made famous: &quot;It's better to burn out than fade away.&quot;  That's just not cool, and it shows this hippie really isn't all that original, when one gets right down to it.<br />Nonetheless, his acoustic song dedicated to the Ramone's deceased Johnny Rotten at the start of the album is rather poignant, and the song does deserve its &quot;classic-rock&quot; status, despite the fact that Leppard did the lines better on the song &quot;Photograph&quot; from 1992.<br />I don't know...maybe I just can't relate to these youngsters anymore...First we have Britney kissing Madonna, then Justin exposing Janet, and now hipster Neil Young is ripping off famous lines about drugs and alcohol.<br />What's this world comin' to!!!!!!!!<br />Thanks for taking the time to check out my message board on Neil Young - TAKE CARE!!!!!!!!!!
B0000C6E4D|5.0|This is a great CD.  I am, and have been, a huge fan of hers, and this album shows why.  This album takes a few listens, but each time you listen, you hear something you did not before, and each time it becomes more a part of you.  Its the total combination of her voice, her lyrics, and the music.  If you love, or even like Sarah, give this one a chance.  And then a second and third chance. After listening to a few times, I bet you will love it too, and often will find yourself thinking about the complexity and beauty of her words.
0783225849|5.0|This is Hitchcock's most famous work and my favorite. It is the original slasher film that brings out screams and shivers. It is a startling film about you know the woman who steals the money goes to a motel for the night and becomes the victim to a crazy old mother Mrs. Bates who's son Norman is trying to cover up for her one murder at a time. It's plot gets good and brings mystery and hysteria to the film, with a supprise ending if you havn't seen the movie or know of it. Don't forget you can't watch it after it's already started!
0385512104|5.0|<BR>Told from the perspective of Christopher, an autistic but mathematically gifted 15-year old, this story essentially is a diary of his experiences over the course of a week or so during which he unwittingly opens a can of worms while attempting to figure out who killed the neighbor's dog.<br />The plot is secondary to the perspective in which the book is written.  Haddon does an excellent job of getting us inside the head of Christopher, who is so emotionally detached from the world and so logical in his thinking that while deftly observing the events around him he can not understand them or draw proper conclusions.  <br />The resulting story is both sad and humorous.  Sad, because we realize that on top of just the sheer challenge of coping with life, Christopher's condition has robbed him (and his family, to some extent) of the very essence of what is rewarding in life - the ability to connect emotionally with others.  In a sense we see that his autism has stolen a significant part of his humanity from him, rendering him an island unto himself unable to truly relate to others. The nuance and subtlety of life is lost on him.  And humorous because we see how Christopher's condition allows him to be more or less oblivious to the annoyance or outrage of others attempting to deal with what they see as his weird behavior.<br />Ultimately, this story is well-worth reading simply because it expands our understanding of the human condition.  Rather than being just another book in the long line of stories that we will read, and ultimately forget - this story shows us the world from a very different perspective.  And in doing so, it causes us to evaluate our own lives and to realize just how important feelings and emotions are to our ability to derive enjoyment from others and from life.<BR>
006092988X|5.0|You know those books you continually read over and over? The ones that grab you with their honesty, their utter beauty? This is one of those. This book is by far my favorite book--and considering how much I read, that is saying quite a bit. The writing is simple and elegant in that simplicity. Betty Smith has a way with words that pulls you in and lets you experience everything as if it were entirely firsthand. Because of that, this is not a book to read through quickly, but to savor at length. It paints pictures in your mind that settle into the crevices of your imagination, to be brought out later and enjoyed. They just don't write them like this, anymore.

Nevertheless, anyone with a little knowledge of religious studies or art history will find Brown's blatantly erroneous accounts of Christianity's development or Da Vinci's work unsettling.  He comfortably weaves such falsehoods with fascintating historical information in such a way that the average reader will be unable to distinguish the two.  At best this is manipulative, however, at its worst, it is grossly deceiving and unprofessional.
B00005JMCN|4.0|It would be a disservice to Seabiscuit to damn it with faint praise by suggesting that it is among the best of \\"feel good films.\\" In fact, it is. After seeing it again recently, however, I thought less of it than I did when I first saw it. Why? Because (one man's opinion) it manipulates the viewer's emotions rather than allowing the compelling drama of the featured underdogs (owner, jockey, trainer, and horse) to attract, engage, and sustain interest in their collaboration. Most of those who see this film already know that, in 1938, \\"the Runt\\" defeated War Admiral in their long-delayed confrontation in the Pimlico Special. Therefore, authentic drama develops during the explanation of HOW that was accomplished. Director Gary Ross wrote the screenplay based on Laura Hillenbrand's best-selling biography.  He examines preparations for that great victory (in effect a match race) with meticulous care. Credit John Schwartzman with superb cinematography. As for the acting, it is consistently outstanding, notably the performances by Cooper (Tom Smith), Macy (\\"Tick Tock\\" McGlaughlin), and Stevens (George Woolf). Some have objected to liberties taken with certain facts concerning Seabiscuit and (especially) Red Pollard. I could not care less. This is a well-made, highly entertaining film. I just wish Ross and his associates hadn't tried so hard to conscript my emotional involvement. Given the inherent appeal of this story, I would have been an eager volunteer.<br />The special DVD features include a commentary by Ross and Steven Soderbergh, &quot;Seabiscuit: Racing Through History,&quot; &quot;Bringing the Legend to Life: The Making of Seabiscuit, and &quot;Anatomy of a Movie Moment: From Script to Screen&quot;
B00008EY9G|5.0|I think there are two basic types of movie watchers. The first goes into each film trying to figure it out. That's the whole goal. If they succeed, then the movie is \\"predictable\\" and \\"stupid\\". If not, then the \\"plot made no sense\\" or \\"whole thing was just so boring\\" and other comments. No way to win.<br />The second type of movie watcher sees the film to enjoy the movie and does not make guessing the twists or the endings the whole goal. This is me. Because of this, I was truly able to enjoy \\"Identity\\", especially when the story took its turn. <br />You see, anyone remotely familiar with great stories in the last hundred years has heard of Agatha Christie's \\"And Then There Were None\\" where one by one people die at the hand of some unknown killer on site, since leaving the scene is impossible. The killer must be one of them. For the first hour, this appears to be a retread of this classic tale.<br />At this point in the movie, either you are in category 1 and you hate the film, or you are in category 2 and you love it because it will challenge you and it will hit you hard. Even if you are able to see the surprise coming, you have to admit that looking through the story it does not cheat. It stays faithful to the parameters it has set and that's all you can ask.<br />Yes, the acting is good and the screenplay is well executed and editing and all that, but this film does not depend on the actors. It works well as fiction and I think you could have replaced the actors with other capable performers and not lost much. Very few people I have spoken with have been real concerned with Cusack's or Liotta's performances.<br />I will admit that the very end seems a little tacked on. Hollywood seems to have a formula they have to follow and one is an ending like this one. It works, but it is unnecessary. The movie actually twists twice and it does not have to. <br />Just look at the comments throughout these reviews. Most are either love or hate. I think some people get mad when movies put one over on them... not me! I was first in line to get the DVD when it came out. This is simply one of the most effective horror movies I have ever seen. It's Hitchcock meets Christie meets Steven King. I hope you enjoy it.
B00003CWL6|3.0|With so many reviews, I guess the core materials have been covered.  So, into the fray!  American Beauty was much hailed, but Ref, essentially an earlier concept of the same movie, went unrecognized, due to its comedic classification.  The Ref utilized some of the same cast members, whose performance there, I felt, was superior.  Despite the show's sometimes goofy presentation, the issues and emotions had far more depth than the later release.  Too, Beauty had a preachy quality, telling you how to live your life.  The Ref, doesn't really tell you how; it just says you can't control everything that happens to you - deal with it.  Furthermore, Beauty had a flitty feel (perhaps a result of the repetitious musical cues), simply inhanced by one-dimensional characters, who never really connect.  The Ref's characters are very similar, on a basic level; and yet, they not only connect, they clash painfully.  Even the insignificant townsfolk have layers of unexplored realism.  These people are forced to confront their issues, to learn and grow.  Beauty's people, on the other hand, seem to drift even further into their own isolated misery, spiting the movies intended message.  Leary's role in The Ref is multi fold.  Primarily, he is the catalyst of change and the voice of chaos - little effort on his part.  Ultimately, while his humor may have removed the film from any Oscar contentions, it also gives the viewer a much needed stress release valve.  The drama there is so intense, you get the idea that this family would happily choke the life out of each other.  When (like me) Leary goes off on a rant, anger is displaced with negative jocularity, creating an antithetical surrealism.  It's like being comforted by the fact that your buddies laugh at you for doing something stupid. The &quot;ref&quot; both makes and breaks the movie.  I will concede this however; had I not seen The Ref, my opinion of American Beauty would be higher.  You know how it is; everything is relative - good is only good until there is something better (but in this case, better came first).
B00003CX9E|5.0|Can you imagine what the perception of RKO was at the time they made this decision? Let's see, how about we give complete control of a major film to a twenty five year old radio voice with zero film experience (whose claim to fame was scaring the life out of the public with a fake story about aliens landing on earth) and even better, let him staff the movie with actors who have little to no screen experience. On top of that, we'll let it become one of the most controversial pictures of its time because it mirrors the life of one of the biggest names in America today. Why, it may never be able to be released because of the lawsuits-- Great idea!<br />I have just described Citizen Kane. All of the above is true, which makes the fact that it is possibly the greatest film in American Film History even more amazing. Everything is perfect. The script (which Welles co-wrote), the actors (all relative unknowns except Welles and Joseph Cotton), the special effects (listen to Roger Ebert's Commentary on this special edition for details) and finally, the makeup-- You won't believe how great a job they do making 25 year old Welles look 60.<br />As for the story, it's done in a most interesting fashion. Charles Foster Kane (Welles) dies at the very beginning of the movie and utters his famous last word &quot;Rosebud&quot;. A reporter is given the task of finding out just what that one word meant. So he goes and interviews all the people who knew Kane to try to learn the meaning of the word. In the process, we are shown Kane through the eyes of those who knew him. We never see Kane through his own eyes, always what his former associates saw.<br />This is interesting, because Kane is a tragic figure as seen by just about everyone. He is unhappy and lonely. We as an audience eventually learn the meaning of Rosebud. I have read reviews that complain that the movie is about this one thing (I won't reveal what it is). But long before we learn the identity of Rosebud, the film has madeits point. What is the point? My opinion is that the film shows us basically the worthlessness and despair of materialism. Loving &quot;stuff&quot; or money will ultimately lead to unhappiness.<br />By the way, this movie almost was never seen. The man I spoke of at the beginning of the review is William Randolph Hearst, former newspaper magnate. He saw too much of himself in the film and sued to squash it. Fortunately he lost. The second disc in the set is a two hour documentary on this topic. It is also excellent and well worth a viewing.<br />One last thing. Although this movie has been ranked on the AFI list as number one American movie of all time, it did NOT win Best Picture in 1941. That film? &quot;How Green was my Valley&quot;
B000084T18|1.0|I absolutely loathe this album.  It a prime example of one of the worst trends in all of hip-hop.  &quot;Cheerleader rap&quot; such as this and Nelly and Ja Rule, needs to work it's way out of the mainstream and hopefully in a hurry.  I've heard previous 50-Cent songs and mixtapes and he showed great potential in the early days.  Too bad fancy production turned him into a rapper who only sings hooks (and badly) and only has 9 bullets to talk about.  WHOOPTY DOO.  9 bullets may give you street cred, but it doesn't make you flow any better. <br />If you want an album full of cheerleader anthems that will be &quot;hot&quot; for another month or so, pick this up.  If you want something with a little substance and a lot more talent, pick up anything else...
B0000399WI|5.0|The plot of this film does not sound promising. Two guys become close friends while sharing time in a prison for twenty years. It is also very long, clocking in at around 2 hours 20 minutes. However, this is quite possibly the most enjoyable movie I have ever seen, with great characters and super pacing leading to a wonderful surprise ending.<br />This movie lost the best picture Oscar in 1994 to Forrest Gump. While Tom Hanks deserved the best Actor award that year, that movie was no where near as good as this one. Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a Maine Banker who is falsly convicted of the double murder of his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison for two life sentences, one for each victim.<br />Early in his stay, he meets &quot;Red&quot; (Morgan Freeman) who has already logged twenty years there and is turned down for parole when we first meet him. Red is the man who has the connections to get anything the prisoners want, for a price. He actually has no respect for Andy when he first sees him, but eventually they become very close.<br />The movie is fantastic in the way it sets up the personalities of the various characters in just a few scenes. Both the warden and the head guard are extremely evil men, yet we don't see them more than in just a few scenes. Their characters are established early and we grow to hate them almost immediately.<br />The ending has several parts and it is great. It may be one of the most complete surprise endings ever, several strands in the story seem to come together at once. Should have been best picture.

B0000C6E4D|1.0|Is this the same Sarah McLauchlan that sucked last time I bought a cd of hers!? I believe so. This is pathetic. She's got the looks, not the voice. She needs to just get a job at Maximus and get it over with. Either go into Playboy or stop wasting my time!
B00005JLYW|1.0|.<br />I'm a big fan of Drew Barrymore, so I wanted to like this movie, I really did.  The movie is a bunch of mindless action sequences.  That's ok, because it's an action movie, right?  But this movie goes further and insults your intelligence.  It shows you the impossible and you're supposed to accept it like it really happened.  There has to be some reality to an action movie and there has to be some sort of plot to a movie to make it enjoyable.  My memory is fuzzy because it's been awhile, but the scene where the three of them are blown out of a building (through windows) and land perfectly on the ground evenly spaced apart from each other, even though they were in different parts of the room at the time.  Once in a movie is acceptable, but this movie is one slap after another to the face of any thinking person.  Sure, I liked seeing the girls parade around in skimpy outfits, but give us credit... we're not that shallow.  The movie shoves girl power down your throat, but makes it highly unbelievable at the same time... just the sort of thing every young girl needs to see, women doing the impossible.  Nice role models.  The so-called \\"fighting\\" in this movie is a bunch of wire-fu sequences that are equally unbelievable.  It's an over-the-top stuntfest first and a movie second.  Stunts alone don't make a movie and that was their big mistake--that and making the stunts so over the top they make you laugh because of the impossible.  This movie teeters just above Kung Pow--the worst movie in recent history.
B0000CABBW|5.0|WHALE RIDER is the wonderful story of a young girl born into the male-dominated world of a Maori tribe.  When her twin brother, the anticipated future chief, dies at birth her tradition-bound grandfather is unwilling to accept her, feeling that her birth is a bad omen that has effectively broken the patriarchal ties to the original ancestral leader and Whale Rider, the legendary Paikea.  The story blossoms as our heroine, also named Paikea (Pai for short), gently teaches an old man how desire, vision and love can go well beyond tradition.<br />Keisha Castle-Hughes is marvelous in the role of Pai.  Nominated for the Academy Award for best actress--the youngest nominee ever in the category--Ms. Castle-Hughes promises to be someone from whom we will be seeing some great performances for many years to come.  It seems that the Academy got it right with this one and hopefully we'll see Keisha proudly toting Oscar very soon.<br />Douglas McAllister
B000003TAL|5.0|Double albums are usually sprawling, definitive statements done by a band with more than just a hint of pretention.  Well, all of that definitely applies with Sonic Youth's masterpiece &quot;Daydream Nation;&quot; the thing is, the pretention just so happens to be richly deserved and largely ranks just behind classic albums by the Who, Zeppelin, Beatles, etc. as one of the greatest albums of all-time.<br />Why?  Well Sonic Youth took the noise-avante-gardeism of The Velvet Underground's &quot;White Light/White Heat,&quot; the almost progressivism of Television, and the thrash punk of their own earlier works and perfected it.  SY's first move toward rock and roll was with their excellent &quot;EVOL&quot; 1986 album.  Next year's &quot;Sister&quot; was a classic.  But &quot;D. Nation&quot; is all of those elements taken to the next level and inspiring an entire genre and decade of artists.  Its easy to hear this album's influence on bands like Nirvana and even modern day artists like the Strokes.  But SY and this album blew the pallet wide open for alternate guitar tunnings, which cannot be accounted for by simply naming people that tried to emulate the sounds.<br />Suffice it to say that noise became art for the masses just as it had become art for the underground previously with bands like the Stooges, VU, and the Modern Lovers.  It was time to advance.  This perfect album is all over the map a la &quot;The White Album,&quot; with straight forward rock (&quot;Total Trash,&quot; &quot;Teen Age Riot&quot;), noisy art (&quot;Cross the Breeze,&quot; &quot;Silver Rocket,&quot; &quot;Hey Joni&quot;), poetry (&quot;The Sprawl,&quot; &quot;Providence&quot;), and beauty (&quot;Candle&quot;).  And believe it or not, even as this is their masterpiece, it only scratches the surface of the incredible power and potential of Sonic Youth.  8 or 9 albums in, and I'm still wanting more.  One of the 10 greatest bands of all-time too!  Overall:  10 out of 10.
0156027321|5.0|It started with the cover...<br />What could this be?  A  young man, rolled up into the fetal position in the rear of a small lifeboat and a TIGER (?) at the bow?  Floating on a spacious body of water, the cover screams for explanation. <br />And what an explanation!<br />Get ready for one of the most entertaining, original stories in the last 5 years.Yann Martel tells a tale of  16 year old Pi, from Pondicherry, India as he and his family  make a life changing decision to sell their zoo and animals to emigrate to Canada.  Pi's family were devoted to their animals, and they have been  well cared for  during their lives at the Indian zoo.  In the family's last gesture of love and responsibility, they also board the Japanese cargo ship which is to carry the animals to their new homes in zoos of North America.  The family plans to care for them in transit, as the trip will be stressfull and the cargo workers are not  adept at handling the diverse range of creatures.<br />Unfortunately, the ship sinks.  Pi finds himself barely alive, clinging to a life boat after the cargo workers threw him overboard as bait for a hyena trapped in the life boat they wanted for themselves.  The story now becomes one of survival as Pi also finds himself housed with a seriously wounded zebra, a beloved orangutan and the huge 450 pound Bengal tiger by the name of Richard Parker.  (name explained in the content.) And, let us not forget, the very hungry, agitated hyena.<br />Not lost in the survival adventure, is the strength and  loving nature of Pi.  His love for his family and his religion (s), the attention he paid to caretaking of the zoo animals serves to be the key to his survival while drifting 227 days on a 26 foot lifeboat.  Intense and horror filled days and nights are eloquently revealed as Pi struggles to make it one more day in a situation so unbelievable that it reads believable.  <br />Stunning, magnificent, perfection!!  Pay attention to how many people have read this novel,the glowing reviews and the sales success.  You will not be disappointed by this incredible book.
0452282152|3.0|When Griet, a young lady, had to work as a maid in the Vermeer's household, she didn't know what a drastic change would occur. From an evil mistress (who is eternally pregnant), a jealous coworker, children who like making trouble for Griet, and the butcher's son who has set his eyes on her, Griet's only consolations are from her Master, Vermeer, and his paintings. Chosen as an art apprentice, by the master himself, Griet strives for her master's attention. The master is a strange, distant man who spends most of his time in his art room preparing for a painting. As Vermeer has a good reputation, he tries to keep it by working for perfection at his paintings. When his reputation and his career are almost ruined by a request demeaning to Griet, the master calls upon Griet to make a decision that may get her booted out of the Vermeer household. --Though this novel certainly was captivating, many points were not explained properly, leaving a reader a bit confused. The most confusing of these points would probably have been those of Griet's emotions, and of the Master's decisions. So little is given of the Master's character, that a reader must make guesses for many of his decisions. Also, Griet's emotions were a bit strange, and also were not explained clearly. She seemed a bit distant throughout the novel, making her seem shallow. As a reader I didn't like her character very much because of that aspect.
B0000UHFC6|5.0|I received my copy of this CD on December first, and two months later, I'm still listening to it from start to finish at least once a day if not twice. I also own the Fellowship and Two Towers sound tracks, and while I also played and played and played them when they first came out, I think the ROTK CD is the best. (Note, I still think the other two are excellent and play them often.) <br />I love getting to hear Renee Fleming sing in so many tracks on this album, as I love her voice, and I also very much enjoy James Galway's playing.  Also wonderful are Billy Boyd's singing on track number five and Viggo Mortensen's singing of Aragorn's Coronation oath. (I call it an oath for lack of a better word.) Renee Fleming's voice suggests the proper mood, whether the sadness of track eight, or the cataclysm of track 16. <br />I think my personal favorites are the Minas Tirith Track (no.3), The Steward of Gondor (No.5) The Ride of the Rohirrim no.7. track eight, although I can't remember the title right now, Anduril (no.10)Shelob's Lair (no.11, especially since it evoked the sheer terror of that chapter in the book),  Tracks sixteen and seventeen, the first for the very apt title The End of All Things, which feeling the music very much evokes, and track seventeen the return of the King, as it was such a relief to feel some joy after all the tension. <br />I  loved the song &quot;Into the West&quot; and I think Annie Lennox gives a very good and heart-felt performance of it.  However, and this is entirely subjective opinion, I would have liked to hear Lorena McKennitt sing it. I just find her voice more naturally beautiful than Annie Lennox's. But Ms. Lennox's performance is no less moving for that.  The lyrics of that song really bring across the poignance of the Elves leaving Middle Earth for the Undying Lands.
B000002KNU|4.0|Some guy a few reviews ago said that \\"hardcore / punk fans won't find what they're looking for\\" here, and I disagree. I got into punk rock the backwards way (90s, then accesible 70s, then 80s, then 70s) and have only recently gotten more interested in the original New York / CBGB scene. I was \\"brought up\\" on the punk of Bad Religion, Crass, Dead Kennedys, Ramones, Sex Pistols etc. and have still found this great album and a great PUNK album. Richard Hell & the Voidoids mix punk and poetic sensibilities better than Talking Heads, but I get the feeling that was never the Heads aim. Their seminal album starts out great with \\"New Feeling\\" \\"Tentative Decisions\\" and (one of my favourites) \\"Love Comes to Town.\\" Then it loses me there in the middle (ya gotta understand, I can't take long songs) but then redeems itself at the end with the long but spectacular \\"Psycho Killer\\" and \\"Pulled Up.\\" Not compared to what we've come to know as punk, but compared to the rest of the album, the last two have a harder guitar sound. The rest may not have a particularly 'vicious' punk sound, but the substance is pure neurotic, on-the-edge punk.
B00001QEBQ|5.0|Mulan is yet another superb Disney film I've seen. It's tied for first with Sleeping Beauty, Beauty and the Beast, and Finding Nemo. This story tells about a young Chinese girl who failed the test for honor, but when she noticed that her dad was going to war, it got WORSE! To protect her father, she cuts her hair and puts on her armor (there was a wonderful dramatic music while she did that. It was so unbelieveable and touchy!). After that... well, you have to watch the film!!! This movie was so brilliant that I almost cried when I saw it in theatre. It also has a nice final battle. If you have to, SEE THIS MOVIE NOW!!!!
B00006LHYC|4.0|I accidentally stumbled upon Laura last year, with a big help from the American soap, All My Children. During one of their infamous dramatic scenes, they decided to let Laura's beautiful voice fill the TV screen and that's when I heard \\"I Need Love.\\" After hearing the song, I quickly shut off my tape and ran downstairs to the computer lab at my College and searched for information on \\"that song\\" as I so affectionately referred to it. I came up empty handed, but at the end of the night I decided to check my mail and read my postings for a yahoo group I'm in. Well, who would have guessed it but a woman had asked the same question and that's the first time I ever heard of Laura Pausini or her music.<br />I admit at first, the album took me a while to get used to. It wasn't as catchy as \\"I Need Love,\\" but as I began to listen to the album more, I realized it was quickly one of my favorites. That's when I got curious and decided I wanted to know more about who this girl was. You can imagine my surprise, when I realized she originally sang in Italian &amp; Spanish.<br />I call it a surprise, only because I happen to love Italian singers and their music and the fact she sings with no clear accent. And even though I don't speak a word of Italian, I always manage to get lost in the music of such powerful voices like the great Pavarotti, the magnificent Andrea Bocelli, my next favorite female singer Giorgia, and the newcomer Helena Hellwig. All of these along with Laura have hooked me into this music and the language. I guess it also doesn't hurt that my heritage is Italian, we'll never know.<br />All I can say is that this album may not catch you at first, but as you give it another listen you will most likely fall in love with it! I also recommend that you take a listen to her Italian/Spanish material. You will probably be shocked at how much you enjoy it, despite not understanding it.

0800199421|1.0|On this derivative, by-the-numbers thriller we are forced to believe that an US president (played by Harrison Ford) could actually take down a russian (what else?) group of terrorists, as if he was 007 or McGyver. The beginning of the movie is somewhat credible, but soon presents us with one-dimensional characters and motivations, a lame and predictable plot and wooden, tepid acting. There are some twists, but they are so ridiculous and unbelievable that I stopped caring about it halfway through, given that the resolution has no surprises at all since the &quot;good&quot; guys always win. Despite some competent action sequences, this is brain-dead, mind-numbing material, cartoonish at best and completly disposable. There`s no force to be found here.
0441003257|3.0|I didn't like it. I felt like Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman, being the excellent writers that they are, tried too hard and...sort of cancelled each other out. The whole story is just not very original, especially if you've read their work. <BR>The characters and the jokes were either too obvious, not funny or too \\"typical\\" for me. I think I was expecting something so incredibly awesome. I am sorry to be a traitor, but it really takes a fire under my butt to read any more of it. Try ANYTHING else the two have written!
B000000WZ4|4.0|&quot;Ultra&quot; is the difficult album that Depeche Mode made after the drug-addiction period that lead singer Dave Gahan went through and the absence of former band member Alan Wilder. Despite the changes that the band suffered, this is still a great return and a very worthwile record, focusing the group in an exciting creative moment. <BR>&quot;Ultra&quot; has a dark, contemplative, nocturne feel to it, presenting deep and complex songs that may take awhile to get into. Gahan`s vocals are better than ever, the electronic elements are contemporany without being too edgy and are not used in a way that makes them the dominant component of the songs. Most of the moments here are obscure and atmospheric ballads with powerful, creative songwriting and mature lyrics. The singles &quot;Home&quot;, &quot;Barrel of a Gun&quot; and &quot;Useless&quot; are three of the best pieces of the album, an example of the band`s strenght and genious. All in all, this is one of Depeche Mode`s best records, and that is saying a lot. Impressive and addictive.
0380789035|5.0|I loved this story. I was disappointed to see it come out; my husband and I had thought up a similar story during a long road trip---I guess Gaiman got the idea up and printed first!<br />So I found it intriguing to see what another person thought up in terms of &quot;American Gods.&quot; Now, to business.<br />I loved the idea. The story. There are some flaws in the story.<br />I have read a lot of the reviews and they all have good points on the negative aspects of the book.<br />What main character do you know nowadays has a really good personality, or character? Look at the main character of this book. His name is Shadow. Do you expect him to have a lot of personality with a name like that?<br />The Gods---Its such a neat idea that the old gods came to America with their people. And that they are &quot;dying&quot; out. For a similar story, read &quot;Forests of the Heart&quot; by Charles de Lint.<br />There is a lot that this story follows in myth---however, I know only rudimentary Norse mythology, so I think I lost out on a lot of the books finer points. But it was still good.<br />The characters that Shadow interacts with---they are just up and weird and I don't recall what significance a lot of them had in the story. His dead wife, for example. Being ignorant in folklore and mythology, I guess I missed the significance of the gold coin and the dead wife following Shadow around.<br />Oh dear, I could write on this all day.<br />Look, you've seen all the reviews. I have never written this long of a review myself; most stories for me in review are a nice paragraph in length. READ this book. Its AWESOME. Its good, its bad. BUT look how much its done for all 300 of us reviewers...

If you would open your ears and get that sterotyped, &quot;this should be metel&quot;, &quot;preeps only should get this&quot; messages out of your mind then you can see how Linkin park is different from them.<br />Breakin the Habbit for instance isnt like a f***ing metal song is it?! Damn, talk bout being an idiot. You like your metel, thats fine with me, but saying something that isnt a fact points out that your stupid as hell. And btw not all people who listen to linkin park at 14 year olds and yes punks/goths/rebels listen to them too.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|Ever since I saw Vampire Hunter D and Tenchi Muyo back when they first came to the US, I've been hooked on Anime (and just about anything subtitled since my TV had no speaker back then).<br />Ever since I heard 'Around The World' I said &quot;ooh, something different&quot;. And I seeked out all things Daft.<br />Then Discovery came out.  It was another different move for Daft Punk, but that's exactly what I liked them for in the beginning anyway.  I found small samples of the videos online and enjoyed them greatly.  There was always something in the back of my head telling me that these 'videos' were a little too well produced to be left alone.  There had to be a feature-length story here.<br />Boy, was that little voice ever right.  I'm sure there are a lot of Anime fans out there that like Daft Punk already.  This is the Peanut-Butter Cup of entertainment.  I'm going to be listening to the voices in my head more often!!!
B0000VAFO0|4.0|This is a love story very much in the line of Romeo and Juliet, where the lovers come from two different families who have been feuding for centuries and that no matter how hard their families fight against their love, they belong together. Except, this is also a tale of vampires and werewolves.<br />Selene (Beckinsale) is a &quot;death dealer&quot;, a vampire soldier who dedicates her life to killing the Lycans (the werewolves). On one of her stakeouts, she spots two Lycans following a human, Michael Corvis (Speedman) for reasons unknown to her. After a confrontation with the Lycans, she starts discovering many secrets about the war amongst the two races and about Michael.<br />Now, how can a movie about vampires *and* werewolves go wrong? I really don't know, but this movie manages to disappoint. Mind you, it's a fine movie. It's fun, it's got good action scenes, it's got good f/x, but there's something missing. Maybe the story or the character development could have been handled somewhat differently (a little more back story, perhaps?). The acting is another thing; Beckinsale is pretty good in this, but the role offers very few moments to shine. Speedman is barely on this side of being a wooden totem, and the rest of the cast tend to over act whatever few lines they have (and what's with the voice of the big, black Lycan?).<br />The look of the film is quite good. Very dark and moody. The costumes are very Matrix-y (as well as some of the f/x) but their given proper use. The transformation of the Lycans is not as good as it could have been, but it doesn't really take from the film.<br />In my opinion, this movie could have been made better with a little bit more back story and better character development (we get where Selene is coming from, but the rest? Only Lucian (Sheen), the head Lycan receives a bit of explanation).<br />The movie's ending lets the door open for a sequel, and talks are supposed to have been going on about not only one but two new movies, one of them being a prequel. This makes sense because eventhough the film *only* made 52MM at the box office, the reported budget was 23MM.e of them being a prequel. This makes sense because eventhough the film *only* made 52MM at the box office, the reported budget was 23MM.

0380789035|3.0|I read Neverwhere and was absolutely in love with it. So a friend presented me with a copy of American Gods. It was a pretty quick read. The story is good, and one you can get into pretty easily. However for the depth of the subject matter the story itself seems to only skim the surface. This is nowhere near the depth, intensity and imagery of Neverwhere - which amazed me b/c that was written for the BBC series, not a novel.<br />At any rate - this book is mediocre at best.
B00005JM0B|5.0|\\"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines\\" is one of the best action films I have ever seen. This is a great entry into this legendary series. It has great acting and a great plot. I highly recomend this movie and the whole series is fantastic! Rent all three and have a blast!<br />...
0380789019|5.0|This book is in the top three books I've ever read. It is absolutely amazing. If you don't read it in one sitting - you'll be thinking about it whenever you're not reading it. Buy it now! Read it now! You won't be sorry.
0698119347|3.0|Alex Rider is a 14-year-old orphan living in London with his uncle, Ian Rider.  Just a `lowly banker' in Alex's mind, Ian Rider seems overly reserved, and it's not until he is killed in a car crash that Alex realises he knows next to nothing about his uncle.  Strange things begin to happen however, and Alex soon realises his uncle was not a banker at all.  It turns out Ian Rider was an MI6 Agent, and had been the whole time Alex knew him, why didn't he see it earlier?  Anyway, the MI6 have a few problems.  Firstly they are missing their best spy, and second, they have a teenager on their hands that knows too much.  What better way to solve the problem than recruit Alex, against his will, into the MI6... It seems slightly far-fetched, but seriously, who would suspect a 14-year-old of being a spy?   Before he knows it Alex is off on his first mission, with his own set of hi-tech spy gadgets.  Billionaire Herod Sayle is promising a free `Stormbreaker' computer to every school in the country, and Alex's mission is to get into Sayle Enterprises and find the catch, without being found out...<br />What's good about Stormbreaker is that it's action packed and gets to the point fairly quickly.  The author, Anthony Horowitz, has done a good job of mixing some modern concepts into a present day setting to make it interesting; however you need to let your imagination run wild and out of control otherwise it's all a tad far-fetched.  Stormbreaker is good for a light read, but for a long and more in-depth read you'll probably need to look elsewhere.   <br />I'd recommend the book to younger readers with a bit of imagination, looking for a light read.
B000006E4C|5.0|When a work of this stature invokes a level of profound and richly rewarding response from a listener, its difficult to know, or to offer any explanation for, just what it is that separates a work of this magnitude from music, even excellent music, which just doesn't reach this level of expression.  And this isn't music that's likely to turn everybody's crank, either, as by any standard that considers the vast range of kinds and qualities of music available in the world today, its unique, unusual, and insistently individualistic in almost every way.<br />This music is capable of functioning on any number of different levels, as the many Amazon reviews show.  On a less complex level of response its ravishing surface textures can be accepted as simple ravishment, its simple harmonic structure can be enjoyed for its simplicity, and its flowing tempos can absorb a listener in the sheer sense of encompassing flow.  Yet for many listeners the amazingly rich washes of sound arising from the intricate interlacing of simply repeated but subtly shifting motifs engender a complex, suffusing experience that somehow transcends any attempt to limit the listening response to individual elements or individual emotional responses.  Like any great musical work this piece offers a more encompassing, synthesized representation of a way of looking at, responding to, and understanding the world, and any listener fortunate enough to have their synapses firing along the same lines is apt to experience a truly involving and powerful response.<br />This music offers a powerful metaphor of life itself.  Not literal, not representational, not discursive, but cogent, coherent, and rich with the depth and involving flow of life.  And not just a slice of life, but a whole, urgently encompassing sense of life's textures, and moods, and endless flowing depths and dynamics.  It's really a glorious thing that music can do this, and Reich's stunning achievement with \\"Music For 18 Musicians\\" was to accomplish this with his own new vocabulary, which he brought to fully realized maturity in this piece, and which so clearly and simply reduces commentary about movements and styles to insignificance in the face of such patiently and potently mesmerizing expression, unfolding its layers of sound, meaning, and complexity out of such basic tools.<br />But it's also just simply a gorgeous example of sonic manipulation, with seemingly endless textures flowing in and out with the carefully modulated interplay of repeated tones and motifs.  There's no need to invoke aesthetic theory, or to listen to this piece only when a totally involving musical symbolism is needed to reaffirm one's connection to the world, because its rich textural flow functions just fine as simple ravishment, and its simplicity of structure can soothe and involve simultaneously, and that flow - that glorious, by turns gentle and then insistent flow, can just carry a listener away in rapture.<br />A seminal work like \\"Music For 18 Musicians\\" occupies a rare space, and accomplishes with seeming ease what lesser works are unable to do, and in doing so demonstrates the function and the power of truly great music to organize sound into a coherent symbolic representation of life's endless flowing textures.  And that's a wonderful thing.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|For anyone who has felt out-of-place and lonely in a foreign country, this movie aptly encapsulates that feeling.  Stellar performances by Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson make the movie all the more charming.  Subtle humor that will leave you giggling throughout.
B000002H33|5.0|This is an excellent metal album. This is back when they were making killer music.  Every song on this album is amazing. Here's a song by song review. <br />Battery - 10/10 excellent intro to this album. Starts off with some spanish guitar and then kicks into some serious heavy metal. <br />Master of Puppets - 11/10 dude, this song is awesome. An incredible heavy metal masterpiece. <br />The Thing That Should Not Be - 9/10 Great heavy guitars and nice vocals by Hetfield here. <br />Welcome Home (Sanitarium) - 10/10 I love the intro to this song. This song sort of reminds me of \\"One\\", which is one of my all time favorite Metallica songs. <br />Disposable Heroes - 7/10 This I dont listen to that much. But, Its still a great song. <br />Leper Messiah - 10/10 I love this song dude. Nice vocal arrangements. And I love the main riff <br />Orion - 11/10 This is my favorite instrumental by Metallica next to the call of KTULU off of Ride The Lightning. <br />Damage, Inc. - 10/10 An excellent fast-paced song to end this metal masterpiece of an album. Killer guitars here. Awesome drumming. Just an aweome closing to this album. <br /> <br />So, if you're a Metallica fan, I know you have this. But, if you're first getting into them, you might want to start with this, if not get ...And Justice For All. Now, thats another metal masterpiece. <br /> <br />Later
B0000W3YIS|5.0|I originally purchased the US version of In the Zone and then found out about this Austrialian version.  The bonus tracks are awesome and worth the buy!  &quot;The Answer&quot; is produced by Sean &quot;P.Diddy&quot; Combs and has a funky, original feel to it.  I absolutely love &quot;Don't Hang Up&quot; because it is a different style than the other songs.  It highlights her vocal talent while remaining catchy and upbeat.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|Once i saw this film, i thought right away great film because first of all we don't always get these vampire werewolf films especially like this one, the characters were all very believable, and all through the movie it had very interesting and sometimes exciting twists to it. i give this film 5 out of 5 stars
B00006RIO7|5.0|This is by far the best soundtrack I own. I am a competitive figure skater, so I own and overuse a lot. This music suits my needs perfectly, save for tracks 17 and 18, which I agree with the others about...they don't belong on the album, and I think it was ridiculous for Anastacia to try to associate her name with the production of the album...her song was utterly unfitting.
B0000033P2|5.0|This album turned me into a HUGE ELP fan when I first heard it. When the title song 'Trilogy' segued from the piano introduction into the monster synthesizer riff (and thereafter), I was hooked forever.<br />This album offers one of the best views to the very diversified and deep talents of this band. If offers everything from prog rock classics (Trilogy, Hoedown and Abaddon's Bolero), hard rock (Living Sin), honky tonk piano (The Sheriff), classical piano (Fugue) and soft ballads (From the Beginning)...something for everybody! The aural landscapes covered by this album are fantastic and most satisfying...even after all these years. <br />If you don't have this album, you are truly missing out on some great stuff. I highly recommend it!
B000005ALN|5.0|I remember really fondly when this album came out in May of 1996. A few months prior, there was a high demand for the album when &quot;Jesus To A Child&quot; was released, which is what I believe to be one of his best tracks he's ever recorded. I remember seeing the &quot;Fastlove&quot; video in high rotation. George Michael was a household name. It was highly publicized - his struggle with Sony Records. This album is just bare, no glitz or glam, just George and his beautiful voice, and some haunting melodies. I don't think people were expecting an album like this, but it's honestly his best work in my opinion. The songs are haunting and honest, the lyrics chilling and real. It's a very sad album, depressing even, but very enjoyable. I can't wait for his next album PATIENCE, which is due in March 2004, he is signed with Sony again for it. Highlights on OLDER include the title track, &quot;You Have Been Loved&quot;, &quot;To Be Forgiven&quot;, &quot;Spinning The Wheel&quot;, &quot;The Strangest Thing&quot; and of course the first two tracks. Overall this a great masterpiece, it's hard to find but you should be able to find some used copies or something. Don't miss it!
B000002C1V|1.0|I'm an avid fan of Pink Floyd, but I was extremely disappointed with this album. I wish I could give it zero stars. A few previous reviews have already mentioned this but it bears repeating: This is a ROGER WATERS album, not a Pink Floyd album! When this album was recorded, Rick Wright was booted from the band and Waters reached his megalomaniacal peak in 'artisitic control' over their music. While Gilmour and Nick Mason were still around, this was essentially a Roger Waters album with lackluster music and contrived songwriting. Need further proof? Check Waters dismal work since leaving PF after this album...nuff said!!!. Hell, even Gilmour admitted that he wished they didn't release this bomb. Save your money for either their old stuff or Momentary Lapse of Reason and thereafter...you'll be glad you did.
B00005JMEW|5.0|This is by far the best movie I've seen this year!  The action, special effects and its excellent actors make it incredible.  I would recommend it for anyone who is a Tarantino fan.
B000002UAX|5.0|I was a little skeptical picking up this album (I'm collecting them all) but since I've heard so much about it I decided to give in.  Wow, that was one of the best desicions I've ever made.  The Beatles are really at their peak.  John delivers knock out hits like Dear Prudence, I'm So Tired, Glass Onion, Yer Blues, Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except for Me and My Monkey, and Revolution.  Paul also gets in some classic tracks like Back in the USSR, Blackbird, and Birthday.  George also debuts While My Guitar Gently Weeps, which is one of my favorite George songs of all time.  The thing about this cd is, it caters to whatever mood you are in.  There is blues, rock, kid music, and a raw . anthem (Why Don't We Do it in the Road).  The only thing I didn't care for was Revolution 9 which is just a bunch of weird John and Yoko tape loops.  If you can look past that, The White Album is a fine purchase worthy of being in your collection.
B0000457HB|5.0|This is an excellent set of songs that defined era. Barry White, the granddady of rap, disco and soul, has had his music justified with this 2 - disc set ranging from 1972 to 1999. It features 30 tracks, each of them great for the perfect romantic dinner or in the bedroom with your lover.<br />Disc 1 spans from 1972 to 1976, when Barry was a major force on the Hot 100 as well as in the studio. Just about every big hit Barry had is included here - &quot;I'm Gonna Love You Just A Little More Baby&quot;, &quot;Never Never Gonna Give You Up&quot;, &quot;Can't Get Enough Of Your Love, Babe&quot;, &quot;You're The First, The Last, My Everything&quot;, and &quot;What I'm Gonna Do With You&quot; still sounds as fresh and energetic as they did over 30 years ago. Combined with three Love Unlimited instrumentals and songs that failed on the pop charts but were big hits on the R &amp; B charts, the first disc is grand - slam Barry.<br />Disc 2 kicks off with two of Barry biggest hits between 1974 and 1977, the lushly arranged &quot;Love's Theme&quot; and the odd thump of &quot;It's Ecstasy When You Lay Down Next To Me&quot; (which was something of a late - in - day hit for Barry), before delving into the final 22 years of his career. Here is where you'll find such uncharted gems like &quot;Playing Your Game, Baby&quot;, &quot;You're Sweetness Is My Weakness&quot;, &quot;Love Serenade, Parts 1 And 2&quot;, &quot;It Ain't Love Babe (Until You Give It)&quot;, &quot;Practice What You Preach&quot; (his last top 20 hit in 1994), and &quot;Staying Power&quot;, his last chart single in 1999.<br />The producers of this disc also included a beautiful booklet featuring brilliant liner notes, intimate pictures of Barry, a timeline of all his albums, and chart listings for each of these songs. I think that this is the essential Barry White collection, full of timeless music that will be heard on radios all over the world for centuries to come.
B00000JMQD|5.0|This is an awesome movie an so is the old Judy Garland musical and I highly recommend both.<br />They are completely different in every way but both are awesome movies on their own!<br />I can't wait for the new Wizrd of Oz Movie that they said was going to be filmed and I hope they are still going to make it.
B00005OMTT|4.0|Enigma (the artist) has been lambasted for being untalented, and self-serving. This is true, to some extent. The music is a little hard to listen to, after repeated listening sessions, and, to an untrained ear all sounds the same. Nevertheless, it is brilliant in its orininality and daring. When was the last time you heard chants, techno beats, and whispery vocals all seamlessly chained seamlessly together? I thought so. The music is cool, but the packagin is not, at least for a &quot;best of&quot; compliation. No lyric transcriptions, and hardly any interesting artwork worth mentioning. Nevertheless, this album is great fun for the goth in all of us.
B0000VCZKM|1.0|I love this movie but I hate the DVD! <br />This should have included a widescreen option instead of just only having fullframe!  <br />The fact that they gave the movie the old chop chop on this DVD stinks!
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Cuando uno piensa que George Harrison era la 3er. opcion compositiva de Los Beatles, ahi uno puede tener una pista de porque eran tan gigantescos. George nos dio canciones que mueven a la alegria, al llanto emocionado o a la sonrisa complice, en La Banda de Todos o como solista. Este Dvd, se acerca a la perfeccion auditiva, de imagen , interepretativa y desde el punto de vista de la emocion. El buen gusto impera . Siendo facil caer en el golpe bajo, apenas tenemos imagenes de George, solo presentes en un cuadro sobre el escenario, mirando al publico y mirando a sus amigos reproducir SU (nuestra) musica de manera maravillosa. Cuando hoy todos se acuerdan de George, y hablan maravillas de su carrera como musico, tras haberlo ignorado por años, me deja pensando cuan injusta (y poco veraz) han sido gran parte de los &quot; criticos musicales&quot; con los Beatles solistas (excepto con John). Quiza dejen de una vez por todas que el amor por Lennon no los enceguezca mas y hablen maravillas de Paul mientras este vivo. Y no que lo hagan cuando ya no este, como siempre. Como con el Gran George.<br />When you realized that George Harrison was 'just&quot;  the third composer of The Beatles, you can understand why there were so gigantic. George gaves us songs full of joy &amp; emotion being in The Most Beloved Band or during his solo years. This DVD gets close to perfection, from a musical, visual, and emotional point of view. The songs are played in the same way: perfect. The nice taste is present all the time. George appears (let's say,.. physically) in a big photo over the stage, and that's it. Watching the public and  his friends, playing HIS (ours ) music. Today, everybody talks about how great GH was, after almost ignoring him for years. The &quot; musical critics&quot; always preferred John to the other beatles, during the solo years, and have been very unfaithfull and unfair with the other Beatles. Maybe, one day, this love for Lennon don't blind them and will allow them to talk great things about Paul, for example, without waiting that he passed away, like with Dear george.
B000002WYT|5.0|All DMB fans should own this cd.  THis is one of the best dmb cd's out there. Buy THis !!!
0385504209|3.0|I'm not sure why this book is number one on the bestseller list right now.  It was a good, fun read, but not 'beats 'em all' caliber.  If you're expecting something written in brilliant prose to knock you socks off, don't.  But if you're looking for a good book to read, pick it up.  It's entertaining, thought provoking and fun.  If you don't read it with your expectations sky high because it's number one, then you'll probably enjoy it for the story it is.
B00005JMCW|5.0|There aren't too many movies out there today that is safe for a 7 year old and 6 yr old to watch. But this one is definately the top of my list for family friendly movies. My husband even loved it. I bought the DVD and my daughters have seen it 5 times!!! Jamie Lee Curtis is great in her role. Lindsey Lohan is adorable in her role as she was in The Parent Trap. This movie fosters an understanding between a misunderstood teenage girl and her mother. I absolutely loved this movie
0385504209|1.0|If you consider yourself a practicing Catholic this book should not be on your read list.  An author with an axe to grind against the Church uses this fictional story to push a feminist, modernist, anti-clerical agenda.  As usual the Catholic hating media has picked up on this book as some great piece of literature with new ideas.  Same old heresies and grumblings against the church, just packaged in a different way.  Save your time, money, and even your Soul skip this book and wait for Mel Gibson's movie.
B00009TB5G|5.0|4.5 Stars<br />The Extended Edition does improve on an already excellent film, but it still falls a bit short in terms of overall story quality, relative to the first movie (and extended DVD). While in retrospect I believe the \\"insert\\" about how Smeagol became Gollum (from the third movie) would have more logically fit into The Two Towers Exended Edition as an intro, this DVD brings to light many small nuances from the books that you do not get from the standard version. Most of them in the form of added dialog at crucial points in the story, or the occasional reference to time or place (or scene).<br />I do wish that the movie -- and in particular the extended DVD -- had produced a smoother segue between Frodo's departure from Faramir's secret post, to his arrival at Minas Morgul. In point of fact, this aspect of the movie was completely different from the book so it is a  unrealistic to expect remedies in the Extended Edition.  Nonetheless I wish the storyline had been altered a bit in this regard.<br />Overall, the Extended Editions of the Fellowship and Two Towers are two of the very finest movies I own (of any genre), and I have no doubt that come November 2004, the Return of the King Extended Edition (an hour of footage added) will nicely round out my collection.<br />The bottom line: I highly recommend the Extended Edition of the The Two Towers. I firmly believe these three movies (and their extended counterparts) will age into true fantasy classics, to be mentioned in the same breath as The Wizard of Oz, Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind, and so on.
630542845X|5.0|There are few films I have had the privilege of viewing that have had the ability to profoundly change the way I think about myself, and of my fellow humans on this Journey called Life.  I first saw this movie on television a couple of years ago now, and at the time had only managed to see about half of it, as it was a good hour into running when I tuned in.  Even so, the messages within the film were so touching, that I couldn't wait to try and purchase a copy of it on DVD.  Luckily for all of us, it was, in fact, available!<br />I loved everything about this film, from the special effects and cinematography, to the soul-stirring musical score by Jerry Goldsmith.  The role of 'Jeremy', brilliantly portrayed by then newcomer Sean Patrick Flanery, was a simple joy to witness.  Other supporting castmembers, including Jeff Goldblum, Mary Steenburgen and Lance Henriksen also provided us with very strong and memorable performances.  There are many lessons in this movie that each and every person on this Earth should be guided by.  That's exactly one of the main reasons this film is so important; because sadly, so many people around the world tend to live their lives shrouded in fear and hatred of those things they do not understand.  For example, there is a very  moving sequence in which the Sherrif (Henriksen) and Jeremy (Flanery), aka 'Powder' are in the same room alongside the Sherrif's dying wife.  I will not provide a narrative of the details here, but suffice to say at the scene's conclusion I challenge anyone caught in the middle of a family dispute, or refusing to surrender a deep-seated grudge with a loved one, or living daily life in an atmosphere of intolerance not to admit to the fact that this movie will leave you, at the very least, rethinking your position.  <br />I would highly recommend this film be watched by young and old alike, as the lessons contained therein are of significant spiritual importance.  It is indeed gratifying to know that in an age ofabsurd violence against humanity and our planet, Hollywood has forever given us a wonderful glimpse of what our world might be like in the absence of fear, hatred, prejudice and intolerance, as seen through the eyes of one very special and gifted young man.<br />See this movie.  Better still, own this movie.  It is a timeless tale that beautifully encompasses a much deeper and broader understanding of hope, love, compassion and acceptance of those things that are well beyond our level of comprehension.
B00003CXE7|4.0|All in all this is a very good drama, though I concur it is quite violent in many respects. Even so, nothing most of your kids haven't seen (or worse) from their video games. While it's certainly not a &quot;classic&quot; by any means, it is a well told story and the visual entertainment value is high without being &quot;overcooked&quot;.<br />I might suggest renting it first if you haven't seen it, then decide if you like it enough to buy the DVD. For some it may be a &quot;good but once was enough&quot; type of film. Russell Crowe does his usual great job with the main character, so Russell fans will certainly want a copy if they've not see it yet.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This is probably the most annoying DVD ever. Don't get me wrong, I love the movie, but the DVD begins with about 10 minutes of previews which you cannot skip!! You can't access the DVD menu. You can't skip to the next chapter. You can only fast forward to get to the DVD menu and watch the feature. <br />If you want to own Lost in Translation on DVD, you should wait for Criterion or somebody else to release it. Surely somebody responsible will release a quality version that will be worth the money.<br />Don't waste your money on this DVD.
B0000399WI|5.0|I cannot think of a single movie from the 1990's that drew me in so fast and took me for a real emotional roller coaster ride. Most movies don't stand a chance of doing that, as I tend to be a harsh critic, but this film was just outstanding in so many respects.<br />Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are obviously good actors. Everyone knows this. But the way in which they fed off one another in this film made the two characters they portrayed and the overall mood of the place so compelling, it's hard to describe. The story is truly moving on a variety of levels -- everything from demonstrating the resilience of human nature, to finding friends where you expect only enemies, to the sadness of a life utterly confined (whether justified or not).<br />This movie has perhaps the widest range of emotion I've ever seen in a film, and it demonstrates all of the emotions in such a genuine and timely way, that not a single word of the film or a single action within seems contrived to my ears or eyes.<br />Quite simply one of the best movies I have ever seen.<br />Highest Recommendation.
1558216847|4.0|This story of a young Polish officer,  imprisoned and tortured by the Soviets, tells how he ultimately escapes across Asia to freedom.  As writing, it is not outstanding.  It is an unadorned narrative with very little retrospection or detail.<br />The latter portion, the story of the trek to India, is amazing; an awe-inspiring monument to human courage, endurance, and will.  It is the first part, however, the chilling account of his torture and interrogation, that makes the deepest mark on the reader.  From page 1, I could feel the cold hopelessness of Lubyanka prison seeping from the pages into my fingers; I had to pause for a minute before I could go on.<br />The contrast between the hospitality of Tibetan peasants the travellers meet, and the inhumanity of the Soviet torturers, underscores the point.  The fact that the author does not preach a message, but simply recounts facts, makes our own conclusions that much more dreadful.  <br />People are out there doing these things all the time.  It could happen to any of us, really, for no reason, no matter how secure you think you are.  If we don't want others to suffer and have to endure the way that Slavomir Rawicz did, we must do whatever we can stop political imprisonment and torture.<br />Hello, Amnesty International?
B0000AXE8I|4.0|...but still very good and certainly worth owning. Some of the dialogs from the early parts of this film (especially when the crew arrives in Zion) are rather poorly scripted / acted, but overall there are some superb scenes and transitions between them. The whole chapter about the Merovingian and his wife was of course the crux of the whole movie, and the subsequent fight scenes in the Chateau and freeway chase were excellent.<br />Neo's dialog with the Architect was very well done, and wisely Neo's part in it was short and sweet since Keanu isn't the world's most compelling orator on screen. I do wish the Architect's dialog was simplfied at points. Obviously, the big words and big phrases are there to reflect his persona and analytical consciousness but you have to watch it two or three times before it sinks in because he speaks clearly but rather quickly. &quot;And though it is a burden assiduously avoided, it is not entirely unexpected and therefore, not beyond a measure of control...&quot;  You get the idea.<br />Some of the special effects were overdone in this movie, particularly the end of the freeway chase where Neo swoops down at precisely the right moment and grabs his two companions, then spirals upward. Also, the &quot;Superman Thing&quot; was a little overdone. I suspect a vortex of clouds swirling down towards a rooftop might've been enough to send agents to that very spot, were we thinking of what is consistent with the storyline and what isn't but these are minor details.<br />I think the effects in this movie are more about &quot;flash&quot; than awe and grit. Other than the hovercraft port of Zion maybe, they don't engender &quot;raw&quot; feeling that the effects in the original movie gave (the powerplant for example). It feels somehow more removed from an audience perspective. With the first movie, I felt as though I was &quot;in the scene&quot;, with this movie, I felt more like I was on the outside looking in (though what I was looking at was certainly entertaining).s certainly entertaining).
0452282152|4.0|Jan Vermeer is usually overshadowed in the world of Dutch painters by Rembrandt van Rijn and Vincent van Gogh, perhaps because of the scarcity of his paintings.  Vermeer painted a relative few works, most of them quiet, domestic scenes with none of the grandeur of \\"Night Watch\\" or vibrancy of \\"Sunflowers\\". \\"Girl With a Pearl Earring\\", indeed, is probably his most famous work.  In the book of the same title, Tracy Chevalier creates a fictional muse to inspire this mysterious portrait.<br />Griet, the narrator, is a young maid in the home of Vermeer.  She falls quietly in love with her master, who allows her in to clean his studio and mix his paints, introducing her to a world of color and beauty unheard of in the life of a 17th century Protestant servant.  Vermeer, in turn, is fascinated with Griet, perhaps goaded on by a rivalry with his lascivious patron. Eventually, he paints Griet wearing his wife's pearl earrings.  The fallout from this act affects both of their life, and perhaps the history of Dutch Golden Age art, forever.<br />If anything is wrong with this story, it is what it lacks.  Griet as a character remains closed off from the reader for the entire length of the book.  We get almost no insights into her personality, no expressions of emotion, and thus it's impossible to empathize with her.  Vermeer is by turns callous and understanding, which could make for a wonderfully complex character but instead comes off as inconsistent and hastily drawn.  The town of Delft itself gets the shaft - I've been there, and even I couldn't make sense of the layout of the streets and districts, or get any sense of how beautiful the town truly is.  <br />The relationship between Griet and Vermeer could have been an intriguing study of class difference and how it affects relationships, how a subtle abuse of power can destroy someone who's helpless to say no, how the abused can love her abuser.  Instead, we get no real sense of why Griet continues to idolize Vermeer, nor why he treats her the way he does.  To Chevalier's credit, she keeps their relationship platonic, with only a few moments of sexual tension.  The relationship between maid and master is volatile enough without throwing gratuitous sex into it, in my opinion.<br />Overall, if you're already interested in art, the Dutch Golden Era, or hopeless love stories, this is a lovely book. I doubt it will win any converts, although the movie might change all of that. (This is one of the few instances where I think the movie might be better than the book, since by definition writing about art is going to be awkward.) Speaking of, my recommendation is to get the edition that has the original painting on the cover, rather than the scene from the movie. When Chevalier starts discussing Griet's sitting for the portrait, it's helpful to have it in front of you.
B000068TPN|3.0|3.5 Stars if I could choose the option.<br />An interesting departure from other Viet Nam movies, as it focuses on a single battle early on in the war's development (and the introduction of the airborne cavalry as well).<br />While I'm sure it's not completely accurate, it does shed some interesting light on the things that happened there, and how they influenced the early stages of the war. By this I do not mean that it is a historically critical look at this battle -- it's clearly entertainment and not documentary -- but it at least is a somewhat accurate portrayal of the scenario in question (unlike most Hollywood war movies).<br />Definitely worth a look if you're a Mel Gibson fan, although it is far from ranking among the truly great Viet Nam war movies (Full Metal Jacket, Apocolypse Now, The Deer Hunter). We Were Soliders is to war movies, what You've Got Mail is to modern romances. It conveys most of the relevant facts related to the subject-matter, while stringing together an interesting or entertaining story that keeps you watching.
0140177396|4.0|Being such an avid reader, even I found it hard to believe that I have never read this book.  Based on the high esteem I hold the Grapes of Wrath in, I thought I would enjoy this book.  Despite the fact that it is a short tale, it is worth the weight of many larger novels.<br />Of Mice and Men tells of the adventures of George and Lennie.  George is the brains of the outfit, that constantly finds himself getting the duo out of the trouble Lennie has created for them.  With dreams of obtaining their own land George and Lennie seek work on a new farm.  This farm seems to unlock the final door to obtaining their dream property.  Unfortunately, the death of a beautiful womam brings a new stain in their realtionship.  <br />Steinbeck is a great storyteller.  The one thing I did not like about the book is the ending.  While the ending was not necessarily a surprise, it left me hanging on for more.  While I was not really looking for a happy ending, I did not feel a real sense of closure.  Still, this book is an excellent read!
B000006045|4.0|While perhaps not as seminal a work as some of the other reviewers believe it to be (I wonder how much it will be remembered in 10 years), it is very definitely worth a listen.<br />There is a wide array of styles in this work from a sort of acidic-synth metal (Risinginson) to very smooth and jazzy vocals that will instantly put you at ease (Black Milk). There is also a fairly popular track in this batch from the Matrix Soundtrack (Dissolved Girl -- it's the one you hear through Neo's headphones before Trinity takes over his terminal / wakes him up). Teardrop is also a very sweet and somber tune with female vocals that will captivate many a listener.<br />Overall as someone who is more atuned to DJ-ish works like Kruder and Dorfmeister or Thievery Corporation, I much prefer Massive Attack's best work to that of say Portishead, but for those expanding their musical horizons, both are worth the time to investigate. I'd just try this CD on for size first, as it is easier to get into than is Portishead IMO.
B000089CJI|5.0|Postal Service...A name that at first makes you think of the very frustratingly slow and thoughtless organization that is the U.S. Mail.  The truth is, in this instance, the Postal Service couldn't represent a more pleasant experience.  A band named for the medium in which the two members exchanged musical ideas, the Postal Service's debut album is an extraordinary blend of electronica, rock, and sheer greatness.  Ben Gibbard's delightful vocals, coated with insight and emotion, are beautifully combined with Jimmy Tamborello's crafty and sonically pleasing beats to provide 10 songs that will soothe your soul for many repeated listens.  A spectacular album from start to finish.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Brother Maynard, bring forth the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioc!<br />There are so many unforgettable one-liners and subtle spoofs in this movie, that any true fan of comedic cinema would be a fool not to include this in his / her collection. Now, &quot;have at you!&quot;<br />Get it. Now.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|What I don't get about certain people, especially the press, is that they can really let rip at Britney sometimes. They seem to forget she's been in the business since she was 16/17, and has done a lot, and she's still only 22. OK, she may have made her mistakes, but she'll learn from them. And the press certainly aren't going to let her forget her ill-fated marriage anytime soon. Everytime they write about her, they bring it up. She'll never live it down. Who hasn't got married in Las Vegas when drunk? That's THE thing to do when you're there!<br />This is her fourth album, and it's a lot more grown up than some of her previous releases. She's grown up in the public eye, and has turned into quite the young lady now - apart from the smoking, and not being able to get over Justin Timberlake. But he was her first love - and no one gets over their first love. There are a few songs on this, which could be interpreted as being about Justin - such as Brave New Girl. Complete with this album, you also get a bonus remix of &quot;Me Against The Music&quot; which of course famously features Madonna. There are also two bonus tracks - &quot;The Answer&quot; and &quot;Don't Hang Up&quot;.<br />Of course, there was loads of publicity for the first single to launch this album, and features the Queen Of Pop herself Madonna. Instantly, the press slated Britney for this, teaming herself with Madonna for a single. What they don't understand is that every young female who dreams of being a singer, looks up to Madonna, and Britney has admitted to this. It was probably her dream come true when Madonna agreed to do this track with her. But then Madonna didn't do any publicity for it alongside Britney, and Britney was left alone to mime along to it on stage.<br />My favourite track on this album so far is &quot;Breathe On Me&quot;. This is the kinda track you can imagine being played late at night in a disco as the &quot;last song&quot;, or playing when you're getting down &amp; dirty with your other half.<br />This album is a must for all Britney fans. She certainly comes into her own, and does so without having to result to low-down dirty tricks to get the attention - like featuring a Justin look-a-like in her video. Although she has come pretty close with her video for &quot;Toxic&quot;, where she plays a girl trying to kill her cheating ex-lover! Oooh-err!h your other half.<br />This album is a must for all Britney fans.

B000002GQE|5.0|I cannot add much beyond what the previous two reviewers have noted, except to say that this album moves me in ways few others from its generation have. The lyrics and mood of the melodies so closely match the ebb and flow of everyday life that it's almost spooky in a sense. Though it is decades old, it still reflects very clearly some of the most fexing questions those living in modern, industrialized societies must face. Why are we here? What is it we hope to gain, spending all these long and tedious hours away from home? Does it all make sense or are we missing the obvious?<br />Listen to this CD and you may find some simple, but enlightening answers. Not to mention downright beautiful song writing. It is a shame we live in a day and age when the average pop composer produces works that are the very antithesis of the Moody Blues and the thoughtful ideas behind their work.<br />Highly recommended.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|You think these two people in the movie would fall in love or something but they don't and the film is practically nothing. This film for a few months now has just been getting rave reviews one after another. Guess what this film is one of those slow goodies that the critics enjoy but the average american public doesn't always fully agree. Alot of movies today have complex plots but this movie has some moments but basically it needs to step on the gas alot. The back of the box SHOULD say &quot;If you drink alot of caffeine or are a very hyper person who loves get to the point action don't watch this film.&quot; I think Bill Murray and the young woman who acted in the movie were right for the part but I have to laugh this is such a far cry for Murray than CaddyShack. There is nothing wrong with the movie it is well written the acting is a little so-so and I can see why it has gotten numerous nominations but I was bored and not really impressed and trying to understand what the heck these critics are talking about. Maybe this film is for the Interlectual only.
B000127LW2|3.0|I am a big fan of the Classics and Voyager.  Voyager started out poorly.  They were confronted with the Kazon far too long.  It wasn't until Seven-of-Nine and the Borg did the series get interesting.  Seven did to the Borg what Mr. Spock did for the Vulcan.  The series really developed well after the Borg was introduced.  Season four through seven were great.  I give them five stars.  I was sad to see the series end.  It will be great to have this series in my collection of DVDs.
B00001OH80|1.0|This is generally considered to be one of bowie's worst albums, and for good reasons. That isn't to say there's nothing enjoyable on \\"Tonight\\". There's the fine opener \\"Loving the alien\\", the flawless pop of \\"Blue jean\\", and the rocking (albeit in a 80-ish fashion) \\"Neighborhood threat\\". But the album suffers heavily of a overall lack of inspiration; in production, songwriting, and instrumentation. It almost completely consists of recycled Iggy Pop collaborations(eg.,the earlier mentioned \\"Neighboorhood Threat\\")and covers (eg.,an absolutely horrifying version of \\"God only knows\\"),all done in that typical eighties synth-pop way. But since every album is a document of its time, for a truly comlete reconstruction of Bowie's career even \\"Tonight\\"  is a necessity. Just don't expect to find more  than (very)vague hints of Bowie's genius as a songwriter and singer on this one.
B00005NTNU|4.0|The five &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; films were a great vehicle for Clint Eastwood, The 1971 Original was definately ahead of its time as Harry Callahan tracks &amp; tries to stop a sniper who is demanding money from the City of San Francisco, some of the city's best shots are in this movie, Eastwood's portrayal of a no-nonsense cop who gets no more than 4 amendments wrong as he catches &amp; stops the sniper &amp; then is questioned for his tactics is as real as it gets, &amp; really makes you question the justice system &amp; its treatment of criminals, this is in all fairness the film that paved the way for many cop shows that followed such as &quot;Kojak&quot; &amp; &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot; as well as films such as &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot;, the second film&gt;&gt; &quot;Magnum Force&quot; continues Harry's one-liners &amp; no-nonsense approach to crime, as he investigates several murders invoving many crime lords, only to discover that vigilante cops are doing the killings, &amp; at one point try to seduce him into joining their cause as they talk about the ineffectiveness of the judicial system &amp; that he of all people should understand their cause, echoing his feelings in the first film about criminals, like the first film, some of San Francisco's best shots are here, the third film&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;The Enforcer&quot; is where this series starts to lose its appeal as Harry is assigned to stop a biker gang who have kidnapped the Mayor for ransom, this one is slow &amp; by the time the end comes, you have lost interest, the fourth film&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Sudden Impact&quot; doesn't feel like a Dirty Harry film at all, this one has Eastwood's then girlfriend Sandra Locke as a vengeful woman hell bent on killing the men who gang-raped her, &amp; succeeds up till the last one, who outsmarts her &amp; is saved by Harry, only the last 10 minutes are good as Harry finishes off the last rapist &amp; Locke's speech about vigilante justice &amp; how rape victims are often ignored by the justice system, the fifth film&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;The Dead Pool&quot; does get back to the elements of the first two, with some of the city's best shots, especially a neat chase scene throughout the streets of the city, that I don't think have been duplicated since, &amp; this time Harry is chasing a killer who is knocking off famous people, Liam Neeson(Star Wars Ep I) is here in one of his first movie roles who is a filmaker who may or may not be the killer, as is Jim Carrey as a drugged-out, burnt out b-movie star who falls victim, there are also many un-related attempted murders on Callahan, as he not only has to find the killer, but foil hired killers of a crime boss he put away, how he stops their assaults are funny when he visits the crime boss himself in prison, this one definately brought back the glory of the first two!!
B00001OH7X|4.0|Lodger has no innovative instrumentals and despite being touted as a concept album of a traveler, there seems to be no thematic connection between the songs.  It retains most of the musicians from the Low and Heroes sessions, plus and minus some, i.e. exit Robert Fripp, enter Adrian Belew.  Yet the music isn't as bad as all that, thanks to three hit singles.<br />Soundwise, &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot; can be a slower version of &quot;Heroes&quot; but there are overtones of &quot;Word On A Wing&quot; from Station To Station.  Some attempts to include statements about the times are there:  &quot;It's a modern world, but nobody is perfect/.../but that's no reason to shoot some of those missiles.&quot;<br />&quot;African Night Flight&quot; is a hodgepodge of a track with &quot;cricket menace&quot; by Eno, weird jungle sounds, quickly-sung vocals, and some African tribal sounds.  The words &quot;asanti habari&quot; and &quot;asanti nabana&quot; is Swahili for &quot;hello&quot; and &quot;goodbye&quot; respectively.<br />&quot;Move On&quot; sports a drum and guitar that brings into mind a cowboy on a galloping horse.  The places he mentions such as Africa and Cyprus are where he might his ideal girl.  The weird midsection came from some tape in a Revox machine that got twisted.  Bowie thought it was cool and played it backwards, adding harmony vocals.  It goes &quot;Waiyah hoo&quot; and the source is &quot;All The Young Dudes&quot; from Diamond Dogs.  Nice guitarwork by Carlos Alomar, Tony Visconti, and Adrian Belew.<br />A mixture of Jamaican and Middle Eastern music is the best way to describe &quot;Yassassin,&quot; which is Turkish for &quot;long live.&quot;  Nice electric violin from ex-Hawkwind alumnus Simon House, adding to the exotic sound.<br />&quot;Red Sails&quot; has a sound similar to incidental music one might hear in a Chinese restaurant, with a percussive beat trying to emulate the punk sound coming out at that time.<br />Then come the three singles for which Bowie promoted with music videos two years before MTV was plugged in.  The frantic life of a &quot;DJ&quot; is the story in this catchy song.  &quot;I am a DJ/I am a play/I can't turn around,&quot; he sings, in reference to the role of the DJ in the disco era, where spinning records nonstop to keep the party going was crucial.<br />The angel of death coming for someone, telling him, &quot;It's time we should be going&quot; is what &quot;Look Back In Anger&quot; is about.  The galloping rhythm guitar and drums continue throughout the song, and a worthy guitar solo in the middle.  The best of the three singles and probably the best song on the album.<br />&quot;Boys Keep Swinging&quot; has been praised or panned due to its clumsy instrumentation.  That's because as a lark, the band members switched instruments, guitarist Carlos Alomar on drums, drummer Dennis Davis on bass, and Bowie himself doing the guitar solo.  The chauvinist idea that boys have more fun is the theme here, getting a uniform, buying a house, learn how to drive, getting a girl, etc.  And hey, Susanna Hoffs thought enough of it to not only cover it on her debut album, but taking a line from it, &quot;when you're a boy&quot; for its title.  I like this single, but also because of the video, which had Bowie in drag.<br />Despite the constant tone, &quot;Repetition&quot; is a song on spousal abuse, where Johnny hits his wife because she can't cook.  Regrets of his lack of proper education and not marrying a girl named Anne come through.  Some chilling lyrics:  &quot;I guess the bruises won't show if she wears long sleeves.&quot;<br />Bowie claimed the drum and synth-laden &quot;Red Money&quot; was about responsibility, with the title possibly meaning debt entries in a ledger.<br />Bowie wasn't afraid to experiment and this noteworthy album proves it.  I've only listened to this a few times, liking it more with each listen, and further listenings will tell whether I'll bump this up to 5-star status inthe future.he future.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|&quot;Firefly&quot; was one of the most original, well-written shows seen on TV in years.  Unfortunately, FOX executives never really understood it, giving it a poor timeslot and little promotion, and cancelling it far too soon.<br />This DVD has all the show's episodes, including three that were never broadcast in the US.  If you watched the show, you'll get even more enjoyment out of being able to see the whole series in the proper order.  If you've never seen &quot;Firefly&quot;, give it a shot!  I guarantee you'll enjoy it.<br />As of this writing, Universal Pictures is developing a &quot;Firefly&quot; movie.  Along with thousands of other &quot;Firefly&quot; fans, I hope that we get to see more of the crew of &quot;Serenity.&quot;  You can't take the sky from us!
B00004XONN|5.0|This record, in my opinion, is the most complete and most interesting in Radioheads career. It is sort of a crazy mixture of electric soundscape and other styles, such as rock, pop, jazz, ambient...etc. All the songs are unique and bring something new to the themes of the record. Songs play perfectly together and just when you thought you have seen it all, something new comes.<BR>It has been complained that Kid A is too &quot;introverted&quot; album. Maybe so, but that's the whole point: Kid A represents our introverted and controlled world. Yorke's metaphorical lyrics fit perfectly into this theme.
0375713751|5.0|I could not put this one down! How very true are the basic observations Allison makes about the dilemma of working motherhood! We all love our kids more than anything else, but in order to preserve our sanity, we all go out and work our tails off until we can't fully enjoy either. My two favorite things: the ever-powerfull Muffia and the ever-patient husband with a memory for no more than three things. Tops. P.S. Last night, I read one more book than usual to my kids AND snuggled up very close to my hubby. And today, I was 10 minutes late for work. Not on purpose.
B000089RVR|3.0|It's been awhile since I've listened to Dido (she puts CD's out about as often as Enya)so I don't actually remember what her first CD was like, I was disappointed in this one. <BR>Of the 11 tracks on this CD I found each had some very interesting bits &amp; pieces of music and lyrics but most of the selections just didn't do much for me. Some I thought were better musically although one of those actually seemed to drown Dido's voice out a bit. <BR>I did like that  she wrote or cowrote everything which seems to be rare these days. My favored selections would have to be #3 &quot;Life for rent&quot;, #6 &quot;Don't leave home&quot;, and #8 &quot;Sand in my shoes&quot;. She has a good voice (never noticed her English accent), but I wish that this CD was better somehow.<BR>The liner notes have the lyrics to all of the songs, which is nice, but the accompanying photos are kind of small, hard to look at.<BR>I thought one note on the CD was interesting, something about the CD being CO2 friendly. Apparently Dido is something of an environmentalist concerned about global warming and wants to plant some trees to counteract carbon dioxide build up.
B00005JLU1|5.0|What can I say about this movie - John Waters you are great.. I saw this for the first time on TV and then went out and got it on video (10yrs ago). I never could get the soundtrack til I ordered it from the USA.<br />Well I feel in love with this film as it was the good girl being bad and the bad boy is my all time favourite Johnny Depp. I love the songs and nearly know all the words and moves. Would love to own this on DVD as I do with Hairspray (another great film).<br />I love this film so much and watch my video all the time but now its getting old and cant buy a new one here in the UK.. So PLEASE John Walters release it on DVD...<br />This film is one to watch anytime, anywhere, with anyone.. Its fun, funny, laughable and can make you shed a tear.. I would give this film 110% as you will want to be in the film or be one of the characters.. So many to choose from - I wanted to be the good girl and live the 50's dream of being BAD!!!
B00003CX8J|5.0|Awesome!  An abundance of superpowers, and yet, not overdone.   Better than I expected.  I went to this movie because my husband wanted to see it but ended up liking it even more than he did and bought it as soon as it came out.  Lots of great action and acting, attractive and talented actors, love, and a well written story.  More of a plot than you find in many action films.  I've never read comic books but I find myself really liking comic book movies (Spiderman, Batman, Superman, etc.).  And although the fight scenes are a bit intense for younger viewers, it really is a great family movie- virtually no swearing and no sex scenes or distasteful innuendos that pervade so many movies nowadays.
B000002J2D|5.0|I unapologetically * Love * this album... the melodies, the images, the wash of sounds (thanks Dave Hentschel!), the winter/sadness in it, the humanity, the images it conjures up, the flaws, the whole ball of wax.  It's a fall/winter storybook album to me.  I picture quests, falling leaves, adventure, introspection, innocence and love, lost and found, very human.  I find the album strangely comforting. : )  It's what an album does for you that matters - not what others think about it.  You either like or you don't.  I'm * glad * not everyone likes it : )  It's mine! heehee.  Those who know and understand the spirit of this album will understand what I'm talking about.  : )  5 stars. P.S. I have bought it a total of 3X in various incarnations. Latest buy was the remastered CD. I'd buy it in a heartbeat in SACD if it existed that way. P.P.S.  If you are fortunate to have a full range stereo you will be rewarded with a wonderful sound immersion.  The bass guitar doubled up with the synth bass at times instead of competing with it, it's done creatively.  It's an unapologetically full and wonderful sparseness, a sonic balance of wall and wash of sound - a contradiction that happens to be true.  The 12 string on some songs and polymoog ...just find a good stereo and check it out.  No I'm not a stoner, it's probably even better that way!  : )
B0000VD04M|5.0|I am so angry about Ed Wood not being released. Two times this has happened, and I fear that when it finally does get released a lot of the extras will be gone. Nobody can really give a clear explanation of this whole situation, but I wish I had found it at ANY store before it was taken off the shelf. I will not pay hundreds of dollars for a DVD that someone else found and put on ebay. This is beyond depressing!!!!!!!!!
0385504209|2.0|I finally succumbed to the lure of the Da Vinci code, finding the premise an intriguing one and mistakenly thinking that any book that had been on the bestseller list as long as this one has deserved a look.<br />The first half of the book kept me turning the pages, getting swept into the breakneck pace, but the psuedo-intellectual intrigues began wearing thin quickly after that.  I'm afraid it just got too much of a stretch that the 'bad guys' were always just half a step behind the 'good guys' no matter how many fantastic escapes they pulled.  It felt more like &quot;The Perils of Pauline&quot; written by a theological think tank.<br />A nice try, but there are too many unlikely twists and a plot hole large enough to drive a semi through.
B00009EIQE|5.0|Well, with the greatest respect to the reviewer from Iowa, this CD is simply wonderful. The singing is NOT &quot;laid back&quot; but is passionate to the point of channeling. The production is perfect. It takes a LOT of money to get this &quot;in your room&quot; sound and Herring and his team have delivered just that.Can't afford to have Buddy round to your house? Just buy this CD instead. Song selection- great. Performance-great. What the hell else do you need? Go out and buy it. Iowa is the most miserable state in the USA isn't it?
B000007T1M|5.0|Great cd! one of the best cd's i've ever heard of before! soad has some real talent, and it shows in this cd right here...i recommend this cd for anyone that is a metal or nu-metal fan...because everyone likes it.....perfect cd to listen to over and over again.....and must have for any system fan out there!
B00009V7PJ|5.0|ROD!!! Okay my spelling is not all that great but you got the point. SO MOVE ON. LET IT GO. MADONNA RULES BABY.
6305364613|2.0|Okay I don't normally like Leonardo Decaprio, but he did an excellent job in this movie. One of the best I have seen. It's up there with Moulin Rouge,Ever After, and A Walk to Remember. SO that says a lot for me. But this is a classic tale with a very modern twist to it. It has it all, love, death, car chases, shootouts..and most of all ROMANCE! Okay I'll stop now. But this is still a favorite of mine and I have seen it 10 times. Maybe I'm obsessive, but so goes life. It's a wonderful film and whoever doesn't like it well...I'm just ashamed...J/k..Okay but seriously go see the film..it's wonderful!
B0000TB01Y|4.0|I absolutely loved the music from this show!  The harmonies are complex and interesting.  My only criticism comes from the fact that I feel like I am listening to &quot;The Chipmunks&quot; when the two women are singing.  Their vocal quality is so shrill and bright it gets annoying at times.  The music however, is brillant and instantly captivating!
B000002KE2|4.0|On &quot;Volume 4&quot; (originally titled &quot;Snowblind&quot; due to the band's then-fixation with cocaine), Black Sabbath began to stretch out and experiment a bit, with mostly positive results.<br />This was the first album Sabbath recorded in the U.S.  It was also the first of Tony Iommi's many uncredited productions; indeed, during the Ozzy era, he would go on to produce or co-produce every album until Ozzy was fired.  The sound he gets on &quot;Vol. 4&quot; is much bigger than that on the preceding &quot;Master of Reality.&quot;  The most notable improvement is Bill Ward's drum sound.  Ward shines on this album, showing off some of his best stickwork, meshing seamlessly with Geezer Butler (who is not quite so prominent here).<br />Of course, the Sabbath sound revolves around Iommi's guitar, and he doesn't disappoint.  Two of his best riffs, &quot;Supernaut&quot; and the crushing intro to &quot;Under The Sun&quot; are found here.  He also contributes the acoustic interlude, &quot;Laguna Sunrise,&quot; showing his mastery of many other facets of his instrument.<br />The songs are good.  Geezer contributes some of his most contemplative lyrics here, dealing with religion, heartbreak and loss, and, yes, cocaine.<br />I remember years ago having an original gatefold LP of this album with a small colour booklet attached inside.  Tony had an &quot;Enjoy Coca-Cola&quot; type sticker on his guitar that said &quot;Enjoy Cocaine.&quot;  Maybe that's why some of the songs are more uptempo than on previous efforts!<br />There really aren't any bad songs here, with the exception of the silly effects interlude &quot;FX,&quot; and the melancholy &quot;Changes&quot; (featuring Iommi on piano and the then-hot Mellotron).  Ozzy is an entertainer, not a singer, and though he sounds appropriately pained on this track, it would have been quite interesting to have heard it sung by one of the band's later, more skilled, singers.  I think Glenn Hughes could have done a bang-up job with it!<br />Even though the album pays more attention to melody and song structure than previously, it is still quite heavy throughout (with the exception of &quot;Changes&quot; and the almost-poppy &quot;St Vitus Dance,&quot; so Sabbath neophytes looking for heaviness here won't be disappointed.
B00005JMTN|5.0|I won't say much, but let me start off by saying that I am a 17 year old male who loves to watch war, action, and suspense movies.  Big Fish can be placed into the categories of fantasy, drama, and a little into romance.  .....Aaand I thought this movie was just flat out great.  I can't wait for the DVD to show up.  I think one of the main reasons why I ended up liking this movie is because it was directed by one of the directing greats, Tim Burton.  <br />Quick Plot:  The son of a man dying with cancer realizes that his father's fantastical and very unbelievable life stories were no more than tall tales, true stories filled with hyperboles.  <br />Big Fish is very fun to watch (also filled with lots of meaning), and it is even filled with some hilarious moments.<br />So uummmm.....5 stars from me....I will definitely buy the DVD....and I think this is a great movie for anybody of any age.
B000092ZYX|2.0|I was really looking forward to this album when I heard about say, 7 MONTHS BEFORE IT CAME OUT! (Seriously, critics, stop trying to overhype new albums. It's getting old.) I thought that it would be a return to OK Computer material while still focusing on the electronic-based music of Kid A and Amnesiac. Sadly, I was wrong.<br />Don't get me wrong. There are 6 great songs here. The first 4 songs are classic Radiohead, &quot;The Gloaming&quot; is a weird ambient song, and &quot;Myxamatosis&quot; sounds Depeche Mode doing metal. But the bulk of the album is made up of bland repetitive songs that are just plain boring. &quot;We Suck Young BLood&quot; sounds like Halloween music, for Christ's sake! And &quot;Wolf At The Door&quot; has Thom Yorke almost rapping! It's pathetic.<br />While I do dig the ideas that went through the album to please ALL fans, there are just too many flaws on this album. Just wait for the next album, which should come out in 2004 or 2005.
B0000VD04M|5.0|I really dont get this i think that Ed Wood is one of the best movies i have watched in a long time.  I dont think its fair to us to put a release date on it and then just back it off again.  I have been waiting for this dvd a long time and now is says the release date is Jan. 1 2010? I would recomend this movie to everyone its just amazing.  Please everyone get on here and vote and get this dvd a release date soon.  Thanks
B00005Q4CS|4.0|Two of my good friends reccomended this movie, so I decided to rent it. My first impression was WOW. RFAD is a grueling story about drug addicts in New York, and how their lives spiral downward after the main character's best friend is jailed for possession. This is an incredible movie. It will make you cry, it is so sad, but very beautiful all the same. I highly reccomend it. The only thing is, it is extremely intense, so I don't think anyone under 12 should see it.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Well, first of all, I am not a Britney fan and although, I had heard most of her albumz. I can tell you that this album \\"In The Zone\\" and \\"Baby One More Time\\" are the 2 best Britney albumz she had ever released. After she released \\"Baby One More Time\\" her other albumz got more and more teen bop. And I was losing interest in her muzic. When I first heard the single \\"Toxic\\" on the radio, I loved it and it sounded really different from her previous albumz and songz. So the next day, I went to the record store after work and they had Britney Spears \\"In The Zone\\" on the listening station. So, I took the time while I was in there to listen to the whole album and to see if it is good. I was very impressed and I bought it. This album is very diverse. It has all kind of stylez in muzic on this album. This album is not at all teen bop. Infact, I would consider this an adult contemporary album, it has muzic for everyone to listen to. The muzic in this album will make you move even if you dont feel like moving. The production is excellent and her voice has gotten sexier as she grows up. I like this album alot and it is in rotation in my car cd changer. I definetly recommend this album and beleive me, it does deserve all 5 starz.
B000001EHS|4.0|Def Leppard set itself apart from the rest of the Eighties hard rock bands by having a unique, loud sound and power ballads that weren't quite as gushy as the other guys.  When you hear a Def Leppard song, you know it.  You won't confuse this group with anybody else.  That's what makes Def Leppard so outstanding.  They had a distinctive sound that connected all of their songs, yet none of their songs sounded alike.  This perfect formula led to a slew of hits, most coming from \\"Hysteria.\\"<br /><br />Yes, I know \\"Hysteria\\" is probably over-represented on this particular disc, but that's the album that catapulted them into the big leagues.  You cannot say that any of the \\"Hysteria\\" songs contained herein don't belong.  The rest of the cuts here deserve top honors as well.  Personal favorites include \\"Armageddon It,\\" \\"Pour Some Sugar On Me,\\" and \\"Foolin.\\"<br /><br />If you're just beginning to listen to hard rock/hair/metal bands of the Eighties and early Nineties, this album is a must have.  If you're like me, a man still caught in his childhood, this disc will bring back great memories.<br /><br />If you could make a list of the best greatest hits albums of all time, this one would definitely be included in the top ten.  It represents a group that perfected its sound and set itself apart from the pack.
B00005JMTN|5.0|big fish is a great film and steve buscemi rules he was the best actor in it along with ewan mcgregor. i loved the part where edward(ewan) went to specta and met Northor (steve buscemi) and they ate apple pie and later danced. only steve buscemi could pull that great dance off and rob a bankrupt bank. i give him 10 out of 10. me and my mates loved the poetry which was really great for example the sky so blue. the grass so green i love specta. i recomend this film for everyone and anyone to see it will bring tears to your eyes of laughter and sadness. this is a film well thought out. steve buscemi rules!!!!.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|WOW!<br />On very rare occasions there comes a movie, so wonderful that it just becomes part of you. Lost In Translation is one of them. Bill Murray is at his VERY best as the washed-out actor feeling lonely in a crowded city. And Sofia Coppola tells the story with finess, innuendo and wonderful shots. She exhibits the superficial and ridiculous sides of Japan, but she does it with all her hearth and with deep respect.<br />This movie is really a gem. It could end up being a cult-classic.
B000002UZ4|5.0|As many reviewers have already noted, Discography is a great collection with the first 18 songs the Pet Shop Boys released.  Rather than reiterating what other reviewers have already expressed, I'll try to just add a new comment or 2.  If you're a PSB fan in the U.S. and have only heard their mainstream releases, perhaps several of the song titles on this CD are not familiar to you.  Fear not!  If you like the first 6 or so songs, you'll like the rest.  This isn't one of those CDs where you recognize a few of the song titles from radio play, don't know any of the rest, and then understand why becuse once you play the CD you find out those other/unrecognized songs are nowhere near as good.  Nope, even though this CD is their first 18 songs, in order, you won't end up wishing they had skipped a few of them along the way.<br />My only other comment?  The reviewer below who also likes New Order is right on the money - except for the part about Che Guevara being a composer...  otherwise, a great review of a great CD :)
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Sure it had some nasty violence and dark undertones, but this was part of the story!  I think someone at Fox got jumpy about this one and killed it before they knew what they were doing.  I LOVE westerns and Sci-Fi and this hybrid really got my attention.  <br />I was so pleased to see the DVD set released, if they do make a movie, I'll be the first in line to see it!
B000001FQQ|3.0|This isn't one of Kiss' best albums.  It has a few solid songs on it, but like most others say, this album has a lot of filler.  &quot;Hide Your Heart,&quot; &quot;Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell,&quot; and &quot;Prisoner of Love&quot; are probably the strongest songs here, with the exception of &quot;Forever,&quot; which is perhaps one of the best ballads of the hair-band era.  For some goofy reason, I like &quot;Read My Body.&quot;<br />The rest of this album is okay, but it isn't up to par with a lot of other Kiss fare.  &quot;Revenge&quot; is a better modern Kiss album, but if you're diehard, buy &quot;Hot in the Shade.&quot;
B0000CDLA7|4.0|I didn't think I'd like ToT based on what I'd heard... I don't like Metallica much, and preferred the more symphonic side of DT (6DOIT... Scenes...) than their more metallic releases (Images and Words, Awake).  But, despite all preconceived notions, this CD just freakin' RAWKS!  It's harder than they've done in a while, but just because it's metal doesn't mean it's simple - the songwriting's still there, you just have to listen to it. This is a deep record that demands attention to fully be appreciated.  I still prefer Scenes and Disc 2 of 6DOIT, but ToT is by no means a throwaway.<br />Oh, and note to guitar players... be prepared to throw away your axes after the aural demoralization you'll receive from John Petrucci.  That guy is just unbelievable!
B000063K2W|4.0|Holds your attention the entire way through at its 2 hr and 13 min running time.  Norma Shearer and Joan Crawford steal the show and Rosalind Russell of Auntie Mame fame gives one of her best performances.  I appreciated Cukor's brilliant use of color for the fashion show sequence and some of the cinmatography throughout the film is truly thrilling.  The ending is the best part of the film with a comical and fast paced cat fight and Crawford getting her come uppance.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|I'm not sure why people did not like this movie.  They must not be scifi fans or into the whole vampire, werewolf thing.  Or maybe they just don't have a good sound system.  I think one of the reasons I thoroughly enjoyed this movie was the sound and the dark quality of the movie.  There was plenty of violence for those who say that there were not enough fight scenes.  People were also saying this is just another knock off movie, but who cares if it is entertaining.  If you like the whole Blade/Matrix theme I think you will enjoy this movie.  I gave it 5 stars not because it has the best acting or writing.  I gave it 5 stars because I really enjoyed the movie.  And that's what really counts.
0385504209|1.0|While its not that poorly written, this is by far the worst book I've ever seen when it comes to research. People concerned about condemning the church or setting up Mary Magdalene as a cult figure may enjoy it as a potpoiler, however if one is into somewhat real history this is a laugh.<br />I just can't understand the fuzz about it, whether its from Christians or conspiracy believers. This book is just not worth the effort. People believing this stuff about e.g. church history or \\"80 gospels\\" will believe anything, without needing to check facts or alternatives. ...
B00007ELEL|2.0|This movie is raved about by so many people, but for the life of me I cannot figure out why.  It's terrible.  Simply and plainly terrible.  The characters are boring, the plot is simplistic, and there's far too much pointless profanity.  Jeff Bridges' character is an idiot and a loser, and somehow we're supposed to identify with him and the trouble he gets himself into.<br />Thinking back, I realize that most of the rave reviews I heard of this movie came in my college days, and not coincidentally, most people I knew back then were a lot like Bridges' character-  losers, drug users, drop-outs, and drifters.  The Coen Brothers are great film makers, but not here.  Don't waste your time or money on this horrible film.
B0001ADAVK|4.0|This is one of those movies that, for some reason, the critics decided to gang up on.  I'm not sure why.  Maybe because for some \\"Mona Lisa Smile\\" was too feminist, and for others not feminist enough.  But let me try to make you understand why this film, while not perfect, is definitely worth a look.<br />First of all, in terms of politics, mentalities, clothes, and music, it does a great job of recapturing the early 1950s.  Second, while the story might be just a little bit hokey (a brilliant young female professor heads to an elite women's college to shake things up), the movie has quite a group of legitimate issues to raise and then examine.  And this is all done with some of the finest young actresses working today.  <br />Many critics say that because the sexual revolution is over (and that's debatable--just watch \\"The Apprentice\\" on NBC!), the lessons of \\"Mona Lisa Smile\\" don't matter any more.  I think that's dead wrong.<br />In addition, the film is not nagging and is not preachy, as some have suggested.  It's an enjoyable mental journey back in time, a careful look at a few lives of a half-century ago.  It is a well-told, revealing look, and, I suspect, well worth your attention.
B00006SFLV|5.0|Generally, I have derided US TV with few exceptions. This show is about High School children. The kind of thing I would ordinarily run a mile from but it is simply excellent. The casting, the plot and the dialogue make the shows credible and compelling. My wife and I laughed and cried through the whole series in less than a fortnight (that's two weeks in your money).
B00005JMJ4|3.0|I really thought I would love this movie, based on the rave reviews it's gotten, but I left feeling vaguely unsatisfied.  Bill Murray and Scarlett Johannson did a very nice job, but as some of the other reviewers have mentioned, I didn't feel that there was any chemistry between them.  And the movie is supposed to be about a connection between foreigners, so without that element, it loses a lot of authenticity.  <br />I also spent most of the movie trying to decide whether there was supposed to be a sexual tension between the characters and I couldn't decide.  While a certain amount of ambiguity is interesting, a \\"just friends\\" vibe that suddenly gets blown away by a passionate kiss at the end just seems like Ms. Coppola couldn't decide what she was trying to go for.<br />Speaking of, the direction wasn't great.  The movie felt overly long, primarily because the pacing was terrible.  It often felt like the characters were thrown into situations, just for the shock value or an intended mood.  <br />This isn't a terrible movie, but I'm not sure that it deserves the accolades it's getting.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|Kudos to Jeff Stein for doing such a great job with the movie and making it such an improvement over the original VHS release!  I had reviewed this back in 2000 (see my review &quot;My friends call me Keith but you can call me John&quot;) in reference to the VHS version and was impressed with the packaging and the quality.  Interestingly enough, this edition features the song &quot;The Kids Are Allright&quot; as the final credits roll.  Also, you get to see Keith Richards introduce the Who (with eyepatch and his distinctively raspy voice &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, dig the Who!&quot;).  I was amused by the footage respliced for &quot;Cobwebs and Strange&quot; (which features Keith Moon's manic drums) and to find out that the records John Entwistle used for skeet shooting were Roger Daltrey's solo albums!  Pete Townshend and Moon the Loon are quite amusing in interview, tearing the sleeves off each other's shirts!<br />Now for the extras.  Inside is a booklet with pictures and insights by Jeff Stein.  There's a commentary by Jeff as well.  There's a 30 minute sequence on how they improved both the sound and picture quality of the original and you get to see for yourself the improvement between the old (very grainy and sped up sound) and the new.  There are 2 trivia games with a surprise at the end of each one!).  There's an angle to angle view of &quot;Baba O'Riley&quot; and &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot; (along with a separate bass track, a nice tribute to the late John Entwistle).  There's a tour of many of the famous spots in Who history.  And finally, there are interviews with Roger Daltrey, who's both diplomatic and direct about his memories with the Who and Jeff Stein, a passionate Who fan, who recalls his experiences in making a movie of his favourite band (not too unlike the movie Almost Famous!).  If you liked the original, you'll love this repackaged edition.  Long live the Who!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|There are many ways to look at this bouquet of a film.  There is the city of Tokyo in its shiny, immeasurable brilliance.  There is the advent of a star being born, Scarlett Johansson.  There is the loopy, loose script that--while imperfect--hardly impedes on the breathtaking, panoramic view of the Japanese capital and the two tiny foreigners who run around in it.<br />But most of all there is Bill Murray, smoldering and chuckling in what must be the pinnacle of his far-too-long-overlooked career.  One of the strengths (counterintuitively) of this film is that there's too little of him on screen.  We wonder about this fascinating character Murray creates, wanting to dig deeper, to understand more and better.  And yet the film resists, cleverly leaving Murray's washed-up-but-still-crackling fading movie star as one of the most enigmatic screen personages to come out of Hollywood in the last quarter-century.<br />A sequel might well be a travesty (you'll understand once you see the film), but audiences worldwide would certainly cheer for another slice of this compelling if relunctant character.
0312263120|3.0|I read the Da Vinci code first and Angels and Demons second.  Compared to these two outstanding works this first effort is average.  Be sure to not judge this writer by this first effort, the two I mentioned earlier are 5+ stars, don't miss them.  But if you haven't read this one, you can skip it without too much guilt!
6304712499|5.0|This is very nice movie... filled with great FX... BUT beware! it doesn't have any Spanish subtitles!!! as announced here at Amazon.
0553801546|5.0|Fool's Fate is the third novel in The Tawny Man series, following Golden Fool.  In the previous volume, the Fool and Fitz have returned to Buckkeep Castle as Lord Golden and Tom Badgerlock.  Since Dutiful has the Skill, Chade has chived him into forming a Skill coterie with Fitz as Skillmaster and with the prince, his half-witted servant Thick, and Chade himself as students.  Meanwhile, the Outislanders have made a approach to Queen Kettricken for the Narcheska of the Narwhal clan to marry Prince Dutiful.    Such a marriage could reduce conflict and increase trade between the Six Duchies and the Outisland clans.  However, Chade and Fitz are suspicious of some strange aspects of the negotiations, particulary of the demand that Dutiful prove his worthiness by cutting off the head of a black dragon embedded in the ice on a remote island.  Moreover, one of the Narcheska's handmaidens seems to have contacts with the Piebalds.      In this novel, Fool is no longer talking to Fitz after a confrontation.  The Fool has moved into town and is establishing quite a reputation as Lord Golden, a rich and merry noble.  Fitz is still living in Buckkeep Castle as Tom Badgerlock, but he is now masquerading as a Prince's guard.  His duties allow him enough spare time to continue training the coterie and perform special tasks for Chade.  He is also getting better acquainted with his daughter Nettle through his dreams, for she seems to have a sizable Skill talent for entering another's dreams and taking control of them.    Nettle's brother Swift has shown up at Buckkeep Castle after extensive quarrels with his father over curbing his Wit.  Fitz is given charge over his training and soon steers him toward Web, the Witmaster of Dutiful's Wit Coterie.  However, Swift is very argumentative and sullen and, worst yet, refuses to conceal his Wit from possible enemies.    Then comes the time for Prince Dutiful and his entourage to sail for the Out Islands.  The Fool insists on coming, but Chadeconspires with Fitz to frustrate these plans.  Fitz tries to send Swift back to his father, but Swift attaches himself to the Witmaster's party.  Thick doesn't want to go onboard the ship;  his attendant Sada has told him he will be seasick and may die from it, so he forces himself into sickness and Fitz is chosen to tend to him.  Then Thick lapses into a fever and Fitz has to treat him for that.    In this story, a historic voyage to the Six Duchies' longtime enemies is shredded by many little disappointments and aggravations.  Then the Outislanders insist on additional conditions for taking the dragon's head, including a drastic reduction in the number of the Prince's guard.  Also, the Outislanders send six clan warriors with them to witness the battle and, if necessary, to intervene to protect the dragon Icefyre.    Things are so depressing that the growing attraction between Dutiful and Ellinia only becomes a cause for chaperoning.  However, the reduced party reached Aslevjal without further incidences other than Thick having a residual cough.  They set up a base camp and prepare to cross the glacier.    This story brings Fitz's love for the Fool in direct conflict with his prophecy, for he is determined to protect the Fool from the death that has been forseen.  But events don't always occur as expected when the Catalyst is involved.  This time the White Prophet is himself surprised when the Changer intervenes in his life.    Fitz also finds all his secrets unraveling and some decisions unmade.  Despite the continuing danger, the dead Witted King seems to be rising from the grave.  His rehabilutation, however, is not without violence.    Highly recommended for Hobb fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of covert conflict within medieval settings and with strong elements of magic and prophecy.    -Arthur W. Jordin
0553277472|3.0|I read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance for the first time a couple of years after it was published, when the eye-catching pink paperback cover was new to bookstores (I remember my parents talking about that bold color while we were on our own long trip of some kind). At that time, I was more or less the same age as the son of the book's narrator, Phaedrus, and of course I could not help but interpret the story from the younger man's perspective: this was an adventure story about a cross country trip, a boy learning about his father, an introduction to a life led by beliefs rather than instinct.<br />Now, as an adult, I see things through Phaedrus' eyes -- which is to say author Robert Persig's eyes, since in terms of concepts (if not geography) it is considered autobiographical -- and I can recognize many of Phaedrus' musings and thoughts as those of a man who is at once confident of and also seeking his place in the world.<br />The book is best known as a tribute or sequel to Henry David Thoreau's Walden, which Phaedrus refers to at several points. Others have pointed out, for example, that the protagonist's long (and not too interesting) discussion of what he carries in his knapsack recall Mr. Thoreau's own endless lists of the materials used to build his lakeside shack or the seeds he planted for his sustenance.<br />But there is much more to this book than that. The provocative blend of Eastern and Western thought, the way he generalizes regarding his philosophical predecessors (and gets some things wrong), the conclusions he draws and the way he sometimes fails to follow his own advice -- they blend to create a picture of an intelligent, complex, and flawed character. Not unlike many of the book's readers.<br />Maybe that is a key to the book's lasting impact -- at least to this point. Like Walden, the book has practically become an icon in the decades since it was published. A quick scan on Amazon reveals dozens of books using the title Zen and the Art of something ... of knitting ... of making a living ... of archery ... of falling in love ... of poker ... of day trading ... even of the actual maintenance of motorcycles.<br />But unlike Walden, I think the high water mark for Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance has come and gone. It was an interesting and compelling re-read for me -- as it would no doubt be for others -- but as I worked through it I started to realize that much of its appeal was as a philosophical time capsule, a glimpse at a time when the globalization of ideas was still new, when East and West were further apart than they are today. Take that away and most of what is left is an adventure story about a cross country trip, a boy learning about his father, an introduction to a life led by beliefs rather than instinct. And that's not so hard to find elsewhere.Art of something ... of knitting ... of making a living ... of archery ... of falling in love ... of poker ... of day trading ... even of the actual maintenance of motorcycles.<br />But unlike Walden, I think the high water mark for Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance has come and gone.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|&quot;In the Zone&quot; is undoubtedly the best pop album released in the past several years!  I was never much of a fan of Britney in the past, but she definitely gained my respect with this release!  Most pop albums that are released suffer from monotony and overproduction, but ITZ has neither of these problems.  The quality of songs are excellent and, more importantly, they are each incredibly different from one another.  I have listened to this CD countless times and it never gets boring for this reason.  Every track has something different to offer the listener and every possible taste in music is satisfied.  Britney's voice is extremely well-suited to every song and she sounds better than ever!  I've gotta give her major props for this album and, to those who aren't, you clearly haven't listened to it!!  I strongly suggest you pick up this album even if you're not a fan of Britney.  You won't be dissapointed!!
B00008J4P5|5.0|WOW!!!!!!!!! GREAT CD!!!! BUY IT, YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED! It's Different,original, and it ROCKS!!!  ENJOY!!!!!! ;)
B000063DI9|2.0|I've debated reviewing this album for some time.  It amazes me that it's currently at 4.5 stars.  That's way too charitable.  This album represents Maiden at their most boring and commercial.  It was a &quot;concept&quot; album but that doesn't equate to good.  First off, I LOVE Maiden.  I am a HUGE fan and have gone through 3 copies of Live After Death alone.  But when reviewing all of the Dickinson era Maiden albums...this is easily the weakest musically and artistically.  There are a couple of catchy tunes like The Clairevoyant and Can I Play with Madness but the rest of the album (and I include the title track on this) is simply filler.  Nothing is remarkable.  It's simply adequate (with that said, it's still better than any Blaze Bayley album).  <br />Some will criticize newer albums such as Brave New World or Dance of Death but BOTH of those albums are SIGNIFICANTLY better than this offering.  If you want a good Maiden album, go with Piece of Mind or for their newer sound, Somewhere In Time.  I promise you won't be dissapointed.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Entertainment on television is a rare commodity. Intelligent, witty, artful entertainment is even more rare.<br />Firefly is the most rare of commodities. It is intelligent, witty, artful, sexy and intriguing and addictive and this is all accomplished in only 11 televised hours and three hours that never made it to air.<br />The people feel real in their skin and 'not too fancy' clothes. Malcolm Reynolds feels loyalty to his people and his ship.  Serenity and her crew are the most important things in his world.<br />The Serenity set show a ship that has been hard used.  Dented, battered but obviously loved with tiny touches of home. <br />Their conversations and situations are those of people who have to work hard to make a living on the edge of a prosperous society.<br />Some networks give crummy shows endless months to find an audience.  Fox did their standard job of taking a forward-thinking science fiction show and placing it in the hardest hour to suceed:  8:00 Eastern on Friday night. Then to follow this bit of genius, they pre-empted it, moved it to other nights, showed it out of sequence and generally did everything they could to make it fail.<br />Despite being cancelled, it didn't fail.  Firefly stirred the imaginations and hearts of fans.  We want the movie and we want the TV series the movie will doubtless spawn. <br />Buy this DVD but be prepared to go without sleep until you've seen each one at least three times.
B00006879E|4.0|This is very decent CD.  It sometimes reminds me a little bit of Jamiroquai's earlier albums, although it's not as intricate from a technical standpoint.  Be warned that some of the tracks sound slightly like B-sides from some crap boy band, but only slightly.
B00005JMK6|3.0|This film is a lot of fun.  Basically \\"Friends\\" in a Euro setting.  It's a bit more \\"coming of age\\" story than your average episode of Friends (read: slightly deeper), and the visuals are more attractive than Friends' NY apartment. So, I'd recommend it as a good date movie.  There are however major chunks of political Euro-correctness that (happily) will be missed by most Yank viewers (The Catalan language discussion, identity politics preaching, Erasmus as euro-intellectual, etc.), and the film's happy ending has little to do with the hijinks at the Spanish apartment in Barcelona.  The suggestion is that somehow the largely (superficial and shallow) sexual exploits in Barcelona helped our protagonist discover his inner-artist (writer) and avoid the marriage plus EC-bureaucrat path he was originally on. The characters are interesting (at least those that are more developed), but most are little more that cardboard cut-outs filling a role rather than manifesting a personality.  And none are any deeperer than Ross, Rachel, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, or Joey (In fact, the one American --- a.k.a. \\"stupid American\\" -- in the flick may actually be Joey. This too seems to be part of the film's Euro-polictical anti-American correctness.) It's a fun movie, but it ain't as deep or psychologically insightful as it wants to be --- or would like the viewer to think it is.  Still, it beats most of the fare available at your local Blockbusters.  So give it a go, y'all!
0142004235|4.0|Honestly, I thought the first 400 pages were more compelling than the conclusion. However, this book is quite remarkable.  The Biblical theme of Cain/Abel with Charles/Adam and Caleb/Aron is a haunting revelation into the complex balance between good and evil that defines us as human beings. Cathy (Kate) is without a doubt the most devious and evil literary character I've encountered EVER in literature. Every scene she was in I couldn't wait to see what happened!<br />I do recommend this book, despite its flaws, because the glimpse into humanity is powerful. It did concern me a bit<br />too when I realized that 3 of my 4 children are named Adam, Caleb and Kate!
B00013PHGS|3.0|Backing up another reviewer here. This is not a review of the music, but rather of the cd.<br />I do most of my music listening at work. I buy cd's and burn them to my mp3 player.<br />This cd has all that awful multimedia crapola on it with a magungus autostart program. Practically crashed my xp computer. Also, the copy protection makes such a menace to Windows Media Player that there is a huge delay before the cd will even play... even if I put the cd on repeat, the first song takes about 5 minutes to start.<br />The music is good, but the package is such a load (come on, guys, listening to a cd should not be work) that I won't be buying any Virgin/EMI cd's again any time soon.
0385504209|5.0|This book DOES NOT deserve 3.5 stars from Amazon readers. Many deeply pious people blame Brown for writing such &quot;propaganda&quot; against religion, upset in his trying to discredit their beliefs in that of the church. Well I disagree, strongly.<br />Everything Brown has released in The Da Vinci Code is not new information. Although it is new information to many readers, the same information  was known already by historians, researchers, etc. The points Brown brings up are valid and well researched, and not just pulled from the air. He not only presents facts which I have never known about, but he has the amazing ability to create a FICTIONAL story around them. He is simply the messenger, and as the quote goes, &quot;Dont kill the messenger&quot;.<br />Now for the review:<br />D.V.C is a great book, one of the best I have ever read, and for that, it deserves 5 stars. Before starting this book, I had finished Angels &amp; Demons, and thought it cannot get any better. It didn't. Don't get me wrong, like I said before, D.V.C is amazing, however compared to A &amp; D, it is not nearly as fast paced or suspensful. As a whole, it is quite a feat that 3 out of 5 of the best books I have ever read have been Dan Brown's.
B00004W50T|5.0|The Band's &quot;Music from Big Pink&quot; is as timeless a classic as any album you will ever listen to.  The music is still fresh and exciting even though the album is more then 30 years old.  From the first track, the moving &quot;Tears of Rage&quot;, the listener knows that this is not going to be an average listening experience.  <br />And why is &quot;Music from Big Pink&quot; so distinct?  Well, there are a lot of contributing factors, but the sheer talent and range of The Band is what sets them apart.  The voices of Levon Helm, Rich Danko and Richard Manuel are some of the best in rock and roll: they're filled with character, which allows the characters in their songs to come alive.  Robbie Robertson's guitar playing is superb, though he plays no solos, choosing to rely on other instruments to help carry the songs, especially the organ playing of Garth Hudson, who really shines.  Lastly, the song writing.  Although Robbie Robertson doesn't come into his own until The Band's self-titled second album, the collected song writing talents of The Band, plus Bob Dylan, manage to create a unique and inspiring collection of songs.<br />Highlights of the album are &quot;The Weight&quot;, a classic, &quot;Chest Fever&quot;, a blast to listen to, the aforementioned &quot;Tears of Rage&quot; and &quot;Long Black veil&quot;, a cover that tops any other version of the song.  <br />&quot;Music from Big Pink&quot; is the type of album that can be listened to at any time and still feel like your first listen.

B00005JMJ4|4.0|For any westerner who's ever spend an extended period of time in Tokyo, LiT perfectly recreates that feeling of &quot;apartness&quot; and disconnection from the local culture.  It's not a diss on Tokyo or the Japanese, but just a cultural distance that's difficult to bridge, which Coppola recognizes and accurately captures - amazingly!  This is a subtle, refined film with a thin story -- more of a poem - or haiku, maybe? :-) -- than a conventional plot-driven tale.

The DVD itself has less than perfect menus and interfaces, but superb extra features.<br />Unfortuneately, some people can't wrap their heads around a Sci-Fi Western blend.  If you don't like either genre, than you might be put off by the show, but if you give it a chance, than you'll probably be able to connect with the characters and love the show.  If not, than you can sell it used on Amazon.  It's a ten dollar gamble, which will most likely pay off.  <br />A word of advice: Don't read the episode guides on the back of the cases.  That way it'll be slightly more surprising.
B000127LW2|1.0|Voyager sucked harder than a hull breach on Deck 5!!! <br />Can anyone honestly say they felt like they got to know any of the characters in their seven year \\"journey\\"? <br />Did the crew learn anything on their voyage except that every space-faring race in the Delta-Quadrant always happened to have spare dilithium and deuterium when they were running out?<br />Far-scape and Babylon 5 are much better written. As a matter of fact, I'd love to see Lameway and her crew go toe to toe with the Shadows any day!

B00000I1OY|5.0|Or not so plain and hardly simple.<br />My admiration for the shorter fiction of John Cheever knows no bounds, but this movie goes an already great short story one better. Great movies, of course, are made of very different stuff than great fiction. How, for example, to turn &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; into a great novel or &quot;Ulysses&quot; into a great film? Yet the reason this film works is &quot;time&quot;...<br />The story itself is well known: At the home of some friends one &quot;midsummer Sunday,&quot; a successful, middle-aged advertising executive named Neddy Merrill decides, peculiarly perhaps (though with much symbolism, Freudian and otherwise), to swim the length of suburbia, from one friend's pool to another, until he reaches home, where his wife and daughters (he believes) are waiting for him. At each pool, however, his friends appear a little less friendly (and, by the end, downright hostile), and we begin to see that time is passing a little too quickly, that midsummer is turning into late fall, that there is a chill in the air and storm clouds in the sky, and that, by the time Ned reaches the end of his journey, his life is in ruin, and that his entire existence has been &quot;drained&quot; in the course of a single afternoon. Funny how realizations of a wasted lifetime creep up on us that way.<br />So here, perhaps, is the rub. In Cheever's story, a whole lifetime passes in one day, which passes in eight pages. In Frank Perry's movie, a whole lifetime passes in one day, which passes in about an hour and 40 minutes. The fifteen minutes or so required to read the original is too short, the time goes by too swiftly. This is a story that longs to be fleshed out (okay, pun intended), so that the shifting of Ned's fortunes and his realization of just how much he's lost seem more gradual, more subtle.<br />Each encounter at each pool is like a variation on a theme. As the people from the first pool come walking over to the second while Ned swims away, weget a superb sense of temporal dislocation (the original theme is still perceptible in the background, but already the changes are being wrought): It is still the same morning in the friends' world, but years have passed in Ned's life, and this is emphasized by his encounter at the third pool, where he finds himself unwelcome at the house of an old friend who has since died. Ned not only fails to realize this at first, he doesn't even remember his friend having been sick. Although the camaraderie is recovered at the next pool, the dark clouds have made their presence felt.<br />The encounter with his daughters' old baby-sitter, Julie (a naively beautiful Janet Landgard [and what an ironic name in this context!]), is a deviation from the original story, but works superbly as it serves at least two purposes: to bring home the unstoppable passage of time (as when Ned asks Julie if she can baby-sit his daughters that weekend even though, in &quot;real&quot; time, they've grown up already), and, when she flees his overweening embrace, to further illustrate just how much has escaped him, both figuratively and literally.<br />The most haunting scene, however, occurs when Ned reaches an empty swimming pool guarded over by a young, towheaded boy playing the flute, a vision that conjures up images of lost innocence and invokes an extraordinary emotional yearning (and as much emptiness as the cracked concrete below him can provide) that the original story could not quite match.<br />And who could fail to be moved by that final image of an irrevocably broken man, crouched in the fetal position and weeping in front of a house long-ago abandoned and left to molder, or the scene just before it, where Ned has to swim through the final dirty, crowded, but too-heavily chlorinated public pool (my, how the mighty have fallen!)? &quot;Stings, doesn't it?&quot; Jan Minor asks, and the line stings as well.<br />Burt Lancaster, by any stretch one of stardom's most exceptional actors, heregives the performance of his career. The gleam in the eye, that unrelentingly toothy grin, that look of sheer obsession. At first so full of the vigor of youth, but by the end a (self-)defeated, frightened man, straining against himself to understand what happened, when and where literally everything went wrong. Who but Burt Lancaster could have pulled off such a miracle? Kudos, too, to Janice Rule for her portrayal of Shirley Abbott, a one-time lover: a character in a situation that could so easily have seemed cliche here achieves the status of classical tragedy. And note the cameo appearance by John Cheever himself, looking somehow peculiarly diminutive but ever dapper; a standout in the type of crowd he so brilliantly portrayed.<br />And was there ever a more poignant score than that which Marvin Hamlish provided?<br />&quot;The Swimmer,&quot; the short story, is a great work of fiction, but &quot;The Swimmer,&quot; the movie, is a great work of art. &quot;One man's shattering Sunday odyssey through suburbia,&quot; as TV Guide once so unforgettably put it. Cheever couldn't have said it better himself.

B000001E18|4.0|This review is directed at Eno fans in particular, though U2 fans may also find it an interesting perspective. Zooropa, being the last major U2 album to be produced by Brian Eno, probably shows his influence more than any other.<br />Being a U2 fan back in high school, during the heyday of Achtung Baby, I found it very difficult to appreciate Zooropa when it came out. Back then, the album sounded strange and I didn't understand what they were doing. This album seemed to be a treasonous departure from what I had come to know and love about my favorite band (at the time). Indeed, this is what Eno did with David Bowie back in 1977, alienating the audience Bowie had captured, during his Thin White Duke phase, with the very drastic and experimental album, Low. Zooropa could, in fact, be considered U2's Low (circumstantially, not so much stylistically, don't get me wrong--for one, it's too polished).<br />Now, I come back to it with somewhat different musical tastes. As an Eno fan, I am probably more willing to accept music that seems downright alien. In fact, I picked up this album because of its Eno connection, and was not disappointed.<br />&quot;Zooropa,&quot; the album's grand opener, fades in with a textured soundscape, and gradually climbs into pure Edge--and that beautiful guitar effect that defined them, all the while maintaining its total ambience, until it reaches a climax of pure U2 with a background layer of Eno on synth.<br />&quot;Numb,&quot; one of their most under-appreciated songs on this album, is probably the most Enoesque. Anyone who appreciated the album Nerve Net, released by Eno a year earlier, may find &quot;Numb&quot; very similar to Eno's &quot;Ali Click.&quot; Frankly, it's a better version, seeming like a finalized version of an unfinished Eno experiment.<br />&quot;Lemon&quot; definitely deserves note. It is probably the best balance between U2 and Eno's stylistic contributions. Eno's synth layers add enough effect, while fading nicely into the background so that the focus remains on the band.<br />On the other hand, their one most radio friendly song, &quot;Stay (Faraway, So Close)&quot; is probably their least interesting, because it is the most derivative from their previous albums, derivative  being the key word.<br />As a U2 fan this album is still accessible, and their characteristic style is still very present. There is no denying Eno's contributions to U2, bringing out all the potential they had to create great albums, beginning with The Unforgettable Fire. Zooropa shows, what may be to some people a step too far, with Eno's often strange musical concepts pushing forward and threatening the balance that made U2 so successful. I personally think that U2 didn't go far enough, pulling back into the mainstream (without Eno) in their next album Pop, with throbbing un-adventurous techno/rock that lacked the necessary element of bizarre to make it work.
0553801546|5.0|The heir to the throne of the Six Duchies, Prince Dutiful promises his fianc&eacute;e, that he will present her with a dragon's head, which means an expedition to the remote tundra like Out Island.  The former fool Lord Golden knows that he is going to die on this northern wasteland trek, but feels it is his duty to accompany the Prince.  His friend, who is also an assassin, FitzChivalry Farseertries tries to persuade Golden into not going, but fails.<br />When they reach one of the independent Out Islands, the royal retinue meets the Hetgurd who disagree with the slaying.  The teenage prince negotiates a deal with the Outislanders.  He and a small party accompanied by Hetgurd warriors will set off on the trek to slice off the head of a dragon.  However, Dutiful and company run into a new problem as the local dragon community refuse to cooperate.  Will the two species war, cooperate with some sort of deal such as an exchange for one of the regal crew, or will Dutiful break his first promise to his future wife?<br />The third entry in the FitzChivalry Farseertries narrated fantasy series is a delightful tale that shows the complexities of groups trying to come together on an objective, but with each member bringing baggage and an agenda to the table (ship?).  The story line is exciting, but it is the ensemble that makes Robin Hobb's realm seems so real.  Fans will enjoy this deep look at those who must carry out the wishes of their leader although unlike real life whether it is World War One or Operation Iraqi where the decision makers stay away from the battlefield, Dutiful to his credit joins them on the front line.<br />Harriet Klausner
0783225733|5.0|At some point in the publicity surrounding the 1995 film &quot;Apollo 13&quot; I had occasion to hear the real Jim Lovell say the word's &quot;Houston we have a problem&quot; that signaled to NASA that a routine mission to the moon had become a life and death situation.  If you did not know what Lovell was saying I doubt that you would be able to tell any difference in his tone from anything else he said during the mission.  With that baseline in my mind every time I have watched &quot;Apollo 13&quot; since then I have been aware that Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, and Kevin Bacon as astronauts Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert are a lot more emotional then than their real world counterparts.  However, that does not take away from my enjoyment of this film.<br />When I was in the first grade when my father was stationed in Orlando, Florida, we would go outside and watch the Mercury missions take off from Cape Canaveral.  We were in Japan when Neil Armstrong first walked on the moon, an event that we were able to watch on Japanese TV.  So the idea that going to the moon was &quot;routine&quot; is inherently offensive and I easily picture a universe in which Fate cripples Apollo 13 as reminder to humanity not to take sending men to the moon in a small capsule for granted.<br />The best part of Ron Howard's film takes place on earth as the NASA team headed by Gene Kranz (Ed Harris) has to deal with the disaster and the potential of losing the crew.  When one of the adminsitrators declares that this could be the worst disaster NASA has ever faced, Kranz insists, &quot;With all due respect, sir, I believe this is gonna be our finest hour.&quot;  Indeed, watching NASA literally true to figure out how to get a square peg into a round hole is the most captivating part.  After the explosion cripples Apollo 13 the three astronauts spend most of their time waiting in their freezing lunar module for the few times when they can actually do something while former crew member Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise), pulled from the mission because he was exposed to measles, tries to figure out how to turn on the capsule's power without using too many amps (Stop and think about how weird that is to have as a tense situation).<br />The space shuttle disasters with &quot;Challenger&quot; and &quot;Columbia&quot; are a subtext for this movie because those two times there was nothing NASA could do.  By the time they knew there was a problem, the astronauts were gone.  This time, there is things that can be done, and despite all the rocket scientists running around the place, it is good old fashion American problem solving that matters here.  As Kranz says at one point, &quot;I don't care about what anything was DESIGNED to do, I care about what it CAN do,&quot; and there is a sense in which NASA jury rigs a final solution.<br />Kathleen Quinlan plays Marilyn Lovell, the wife who has to suffer while her husband's mission is ignored (the networks will not show the crew's television broadcast) and then as the entire word waits to see if he and his crewmates are going to die in space.  However, the bit role I like is Jean Speegle Howard as Blanch Lovell, Jim's mom.  Blanch is in a retirement home and is not always clear on what is going on; when Marilyn assigned Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin to distract her from the worst predictions of disaster on television as Apollo 13 heads back to earth she wonders if they work with her son.  But when Marilyn and the kids first tell her about what is happening with the mission and she notices her granddaughter is scared, she tells her: &quot;Don't you worry. If they could get a washing machine to fly, my Jimmy could land it.&quot;<br />Much was made about what the cast and crew went through to make &quot;Apollo 13,&quot; during zero-G dives in an aircraft containing a capsule set to film the weightlessness scenes.  But as much as the film and the story about technology, both really come down to the human beings.  Harris and Quinlan were both nominated for their supporting roles and the film was up for Best Picture, but was one of those rare nominees that directed itself (i.e., Howard was not nominated) and won Oscars for Film Editing and Sound.  If you watch &quot;From the Earth to the Moon,&quot; produced by Hanks, you will find the episode of Apollo 13 takes a different tack from both this movie and the rest of that series that is rather interesting as well.and Quinlan were both nominated for their supporting roles and the film was up for Best Picture, but was one of those rare nominees that directed itself (i.e., Howard was not nominated) and won Oscars for Film Editing and Sound.

Today, I decided to take it out and listen all the way through. I was extremely suprised. I wasn't a Spice Girl fan, but bought this CD because I just liked the cover art (Stupid, I know) and now I'm GLAD that I picked it up. Victoria has clearly improved her voice since her &quot;Spice&quot; days, and also honed her songwriting skills (Writing/Co-Writing many of the albums tracks) Its an excellent euro-pop album, and while its not like any of these songs trigger intense emotions or anything, they are fun. Its a good CD to drive to, or put on at a party. Definatley worth the extra $$ for import. Victoria's latest work (Let Your Head Go/This Groove) Is also worth checking out.

B00005JME0|4.0|The Butterfly Effect was actually an entertaining thriller, with a fine performance, here me out on this, fine perfomance from Ashton Kutcher.  Debuting directors J. Mackye Gruber and Eric Bress create an interesting and intricate film, dealing with the chaos theory.  The theory that the flapping of a butterfly's wings can cause a typhoon halfway across the world. Okay, yes critics have without a doubt just panned this movie but it has pulled off a few positive and mixed reviews.  This movie may be a good enough and maybe even smart enough self-help thriller.  Some viewers may be drawn away from the intensity of it, let me say that first off it does make sense you just need to PAY ATTENTION.  It's an neat time-travel thriller, with some fine performances and effects.  The CGI is fine, not terrible as some people have said.  <BR>     Now analyzing Kutcher's performance is one hell of a fun assessment, sure it was good.  I'm serious, he can act and it's nice to see him turn from his childish and immature comic roles even though he is a riot.  This has been a great movie to start off the year and I'm pleased in seeing it.  The beautiful Amy Smart plays Kutcher's childhood freind and later on his love interest. <BR>     The Butterfly Effect is rated R for Violence, Language, Sexual Content and Brief Drug Use.  The violence includes prison violence with intense fistfights in addition to other beatings.  There are some bloody images not exceptionally graphic.  There are implied sexual situations along with sexual innuendo.  There is also is profanity not especially strong or explicit, smoking and marijuana use.  I'm not too sure I could this an intellectual thriller, but it does make you think in some ways, it's entertaining and even initially intruiging at times.  I should also warn you that this is a reasonably disturbing movie, some of the images are pretty displeasing.  It's a bit dark and gloomy but a fine film and worth viewing in theatres.  Not a bad pick for owning on Video or DVD and would definetly make a good rental.

I'm not too sure I could this an intellectual thriller, but it does make you think in some ways, it's entertaining and even initially intruiging at times.  I should also warn you that this is a reasonably disturbing movie, some of the images are pretty displeasing.  It's a bit dark and gloomy but a fine film and worth viewing in theatres.  Not a bad pick for owning on Video or DVD and would definetly make a good rental.
0156027321|4.0|Vivid with imagination, wonderful narration, one of the GOOD books I have read and recomended lately. Besides the interesting story there is an underlying meaning of life, its fickleness as well as strength. The bond between Pi and the tiger seems analogous to a human's relation to something fearful, the fear exists but at times, its baseless...and the object of fear could be the reason for existence!
B00005JM02|5.0|Another gem for the whole family. The graphics from Pixar continue to improve over their previous masterpieces. The water, above and below, looks fantastic. Details such as subtle light effects and small floating particles make the underwater shots \\"real\\". The storyline is \\"baited\\" with one-liners and innuendoes. Ellen Degeneres is perfect as the \\"short-term memory loss\\" Dory and the aquarium gang is excellent.<br />The bonus material is very good, especially the \\"documentary\\" with a surprising performance with Jean-Michel Cousteau. The virtual aquariums are a neat idea.
0767827902|5.0|The plot of the movie has been explained over and over on these pages so just let me say that I saw it upon its original theatrical release and was simply blown away. I have seen it many times since and it still leaves me in awe. The movie is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. The ensemble acting is unbeatable and veteran western character actor Ben Johnson and veteran actress Cloris Leachman steal the movie. Both are absolutely phenomenal. This is a movie for the ages, though younger people of today might not fully grasp its importance. This is an incredible movie. See it.
B00005K3NR|5.0|this film is really good!!!!!!!!!!!! even tho its old its such a good film!!!!!!!!! it is worth buying! &amp; dont worry it ent that scary LOL!
B00005JMJ4|4.0|If you don't appreciate and understand why this film has gotten such overwhelmingly good reviews, I think it is time to enroll in a \\"Film Appreciation\\" class at your earliest convenience. Your appreciation of film as an art form is woefully retarded after years of Hollywood popcorn movies. Now I understand why they keep making Comic books into movies with the plot a 13 year old could have written.<br />The film is just that, shot on film, not the ultra pristine digital medium which has it's uses, but the film medium gives it a grittier and softer feel. Sophia and the cinematographer made the right choice here as the softer look of the film really enhances the movie's tone. <br />This was the best film I personally saw in 2003 and that includes \\"The Return of the King\\" which I loved as well. The film is recognised by the Academy with whom I don't always agree with, but usually nominates good to excellent movies for the Oscars. So it has the credentials of a good movie at least. It made me think 1/2 way through the movie \\"This is how film making is meant to be done!\\"<br />Yes, it was not a perfect movie and some scenes were overlong/bloated/milked for effect IMO. And the intriguing scenes of interaction with the Japanese was limited in the final half of the movie (a shame) but understandable due to the developing story between the two characters. The desperation shown by the two main characters was crushing and I had true empathy for both and wished them happiness. While at the same time feeling their struggles to be faithful and the pain/doubt it caused in both.<br />To keep it from being too oppressive the humour was dead on. Just enough to keep it moving. I was fascinated throughout the film and it is quite apparent Bill Murray is a mast of his art. I gained a lot of respect for him as an Actor. I think it was the first time I've seen him as an Actor and not a Comedian. The backdrop of Tokyo and it's Alien yet familiar settings was the icing on the cake. The \\"Johnny Carson of Japan\\" is sure to induce a laugh in anyone with a pulse . The expressions on Harris-san's face is priceless when dealing with the Japanese. He is as lost as any foreigner has a right to be in Tokyo. The sense of Culture Shock was perfect.<br />If you like action, or belly laugh funny Bill Murray, this is NOT the movie to see. This is simply a Romantic Comedy between two people trying to find happiness. One at the end of their career the other trying to find her's. When your done watching this movie the comedy is not what you'll be thinking about. The ending was so classy, not the typical B.S. Hollywood ending where the roses bloom the Sun comes out and the bad guy is dead on a pile of rebar and concrete. I don't want to go into more detail for fear of ruining it for anyone who has yet to see the film.<br />That is how I saw it, put my vote in the thumbs up category.
B00005JMCT|5.0|yea this woz a really funny film out of all of the films this 1 woz the best 1 by far. as always this film makes u cringe as did the othas. its a sad ending tho. but u SHOULD BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LOL
B00003CX8V|5.0|&quot;The Apartment&quot; is a great drama release from 1960 starring Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine.  It rightfully won five Oscars, including Best Picture.  Its plot of a man who lends people his apartment for affairs while getting nothing in return is brilliant.  Meanwhile, the love theme always keeps audiences interested.  Such combination of complex stories, plus others, placed into one movie keeps the theme ahead of its time.  The writers know the perfect scenes to add more drama.  Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine have the perfect chemistry between each other as actors.  Both performed their roles wonderfully.  Their expressions alone keeps the dramatic theme intact.  &quot;The Apartment&quot; is great for those looking for a great, unique drama.  This movie experience will answer why it's become a classic.
B00005JMEW|3.0|this film is so good! i didnt want 2 watch it at first because it seemed 2 voilent, but in the end i did watch it & woz suprised because i atually enjoyed it! it is voilent but its got a good story 2 it aswell tho. tho at times hard 2 follow! the only bad thing about this film is that at the end i wanted 2 see the next one as well!!!!!!!!!!!!! LOL
B000001EGE|3.0|This is the third album in a row from Elton John to feature fake southern accents and stories from the country.     Notably for this album, Elton has gotten rid of the big orchestral sound of the last album, and actually there are very few big arrangements. The sound is stripped down a lot, too. Wonder what Paul Buckmaster was doing? Elton is playing his piano like he was in an old Western saloon and the guitars are rootsy and often twangy.     The boppin', joyous, exuberant opener 'Honky Cat' is definitely fun and features some fantastic organ work. Another highlight includes the cynical 'I think I'm gonna kill myself', which is quite homourous, the vocal gets the point across perfectly. Then there's the rocking 'Suzie', which has a good groove, passionate vocals and a memorable chorus 'share a little lovin in the moooon shiii-iiine'.     'Rocket Man' is a classic. The backing vocals contribute so much to the main hook of the song 'rocket maaaaaann', and that haunting guitar, courtesy of Davey Johnstone. Very few songs try to straddle the middle ground between folk and psychedelia, and fewer still pull it off as memorably as this song. The album closer, 'Hercules', is a fun rock 'n' roll song, though could have done with a more enthusiastic vocal, like a few of the songs here.      There are some weak songs. The second half of the album starts with a couple of awful, awful folk songs, the flat, colourless 'Salvation', and 'Slave', which has one of the worst and most unconvincing fake- Southern accents ever. The music is a bit of a rip-off for the Drifters' 'On the boardwalk'.   Then there's 'Amy', which is more enjoyable, but for a song where he is supposed to be *so* in love with his girl, he sounds a bit half-hearted. Some of the lines are delivered with real indifference. 'Mellow' is filler, a bit meamdering, but it has charm.     But nothing's perfect, and Elton made a good move stripping away all the souped up arrangements of the last album, and getting back to a more basic sound, and it would be his last acoustic folk-rock album for a while.
0553573403|5.0|George R. R. Martin's story is brilliant, heart-wrenching, enthralling, and definitely worth reading.  The reviewers who found it boring seem to have totally missed that they're supposed to read between the lines.  (You get all the hints to figure out who Jon's mother was, for one, which puts an entirely different slant on his exile.)<br />But if you'll permit me, I'd like to take a step aside from that style of review.  The story is not what I want to talk about.<br /><br />What impressed me most about this series was the writing itself.  I'm an amateur writer struggling to be a professional author.  If you're in the same position, I beg you to GET THESE BOOKS and study Martin until your eyes ache.  He will take your prose to a whole new level.<br />How can a good story be turned into a masterpiece of fiction?  There are dozens of considerations: viewpoint and narration, characterization, focus, setting, pacing, journeys and motivation, suspense, conflict, and so on.  It is utterly amazing, then, that Martin gets it ALL right.  Every single sentence testifies to his literary talent.  Not a single word out of place, not a single reply out of character.  Perfect, every bit of it.<br />For example, adjectives, adverbs, and comparisons are usually ongoing trials for writers.  Readers may suffer through sophmoric descriptions such as \\"He was fat,\\" or slog through awkward attempts at comparison, like \\"He was so big he reminded her of a whale that she had seen washed up on a beach once.\\"  If you're reading a fairly decent author, you may get \\"burly\\" or \\"stout.\\"  But Martin makes it WORK: \\"He was built like a keg, and had a similar capacity.\\"  Wonderful work, clever twists on phrases that make my breath catch, and they're in every single paragraph.<br />Go on, click \\"Look inside the book,\\" pick a random page, and see what I'm talking about.  I'm in heaven.<br />If you're a writer, your style will profit from studying this series.  If you're an average reader, you probably won't notice the technical aspects of his story... but the fact that they're there means you're in for one of the most interesting, unforgettable reads of your life.<br />In short: get it, get it, get it.ly won't notice the technical aspects of his story... but the fact that they're there means you're in for one of the most interesting, unforgettable reads of your life.  <br />In short: get it, get it, get it.
B00005JMCN|5.0|Once and a while a film comes along that has it all - great story, fine acting, and the kind of directing that knows exactly how to stir my heartstrings without being maudlin.  I'm also impressed that this is a true story, based on the best selling book by Laura Hillenbrand.<br /><br />The setting is depression-era America and the film includes all those little details that make that dark period of time come alive.  The people needed a hero.  And it came to them in the form of a racehorse with all the odds against him.  Seabiscuit was too small and not well trained when Charles Howard, a self-made rich man recovering from a personal tragedy, took him on. Jeff Bridges is cast in this role and keeps his performance controlled and understated.  Chris Cooper is outstanding in the role of Tom Smith, the trainer who takes care of horses that others would have discarded.  \\"You don't throw away a whole life just 'cause he's banged up a little,\\" is one of his key lines. And it resonates throughout the entire film.  Tobey Maguire is wonderful as the jockey, Red Polard.  He also fights all odds to get in the game and stay there.  Each one of these men is damaged in his own way, just like Seabiscuit.  But together they create a champion.<br /><br />I loved the film and I also loved the extras on the DVD.  I enjoyed seeing the writer and director describe their many challenges. I was fascinated as to how they created the close-ups during the exciting races. And I was particularly interested in the old newsreel footage.<br /><br />Don't miss this DVD.  There's something in it for everyone.  It's an inspiration for all and the feel-good feeling lasts a long time.  Seabiscuit gets one of my highest recommendations.

B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead may never write an album as accessible and powerful as this again, I think they bettered themselves with Kid A.  But this album showed just the kind of prodiguous talent that these boys had.  Thom Yorke has always had a knack for writing songs that just seemed like they should have been written before.  Like say Creep, that song is so startingly obvious, that it just seems like it had to have been written millions of times before, but it just hadn't.  And a song like Subterranean Homesick Alien or No Surprises are so obvious and just so right, like this is what you've been trying to say for years but never could.  Thats why these boys connect on such a stunning number of levels, there is a lot of surface to these songs a lot of visceral punch, but it is invested with so much subtlety and thought.  It is obvious that there is craft in these songs, just from the things you notice every single spin.  This is the album of the 90's, not because they are the most talented technical musicians in the world of music, they aren't, but because they are the best songwriters in the music world today, and this album is just one of the many examples.
B000002UAI|5.0|All of the beatles music is sublime and the greatest rock music ever created. This album is no exception.  It has hard rocking classics like &quot;No reply&quot; &quot;I'm a loser&quot; and beautiful songs like &quot;I'll follow the sun.&quot; I have listened to a lot of rock albums and these four masters are at the top of the heap.  They have excellent song writing, melodies and harmonies.  Some critics say that some of the love songs are sappy or immature.  I would love to see them do better.  My guess is  they're  jealous.  Everyone has their opinion, but when it comes to the beatles I strongly disagree with them.  They are just wrong.  The beatles have sold over a billion records. There is a good reason for that.  I hope  the music of these four angels will last forever!
B000002TQV|5.0|Just rating the Radiohead albums, because I feel the need to.  For whatever reason.  There is some touching stuff on this album, and more obvious showcase for their songwriting talent.  Most of the songs on this album are stunningly simple in their arrangements and execution.  But the command over mood and pure sound these guys have is on full display.  Fake Plastic Trees and Bulletproof form the template for all of the Coldplay style Brit-Pop of this decade.  With its delicate acoustic guitar, and floating ethereal backing noises and strings.  But even then these songs beat their counterparts.  The head just never got more pop than high and dry, but I think it has one of their best hooks.  The overwhelming impression you get from this album is just restrained depression, someone on the brink of collapse, but not letting go.  It's fascinating really, you keep expecting a release of some kind, some ovewhelming display of emotional outpouring that never really comes.  But even with all of this, it still ends in happiness, so immerse your soul in love...
B00005JME0|5.0|This movie was by far one of the best I have seen in a while. If you're looking for a movie that really makes you think, but isn't hard to understand or follow, watch this. Imagine trying to change the past, and every time, you make the present worst.... Go see this! You will not be disappointed!
B0000CFW87|4.0|You have to love producer David Foster. He's given us Josh and Michael Bubl. Both these young men will lead the way with their gift of song.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This cd will probably be Brittney's best ever! I'm loving the singles &quot; Me Against The Music &quot; remixed by Peter Rauhofer .. this joint sounds GREAT in the clubs and TOXIC (can't wait for the remix).
B0000AMRJC|4.0|This movie is really good but I think it gets a bit to much hype.   I know that the movie Blow is a lot more recent of a movie but it's a lot better I think.   If you like these kind of movies blow is knid of the same think, but not as violent.   So I guess Scareface is a bit different then Blow.   Scareface is great considering it is an old film I just can't believe all the hype that is still around it.  It's obviously worth owning I myself own it.   Check it out it IS a good film.
B0000508U6|5.0|My first Coldplay CD was &quot;A Rush Of Blood To The Head&quot;, and I loved that one so much that I bought &quot;Live 2003&quot; soon after. So, obviously, after loving both, I figured I would buy &quot;Parachutes&quot;. I loved this one too.<BR>Coldplay's first record is a work of art. All of the songs are great, from pianos to guitars, so harmonic. My favorite tracks in here are &quot;Don't Panic&quot;, &quot;Everything's Not Lost&quot;, &quot;Trouble&quot;, &quot;Yellow&quot; and the weird song &quot;Spies&quot;. The whole CD is filled with peace and love, you can sense such a good thing in every track, you feel that every track relaxes you or leaves you happy. It's such a perfect band to listen after a hard day... You must buy it! This one is a CD for anytime, because it leaves a good message, and it's a massage for our souls. After buying the three main Coldplay CDs, I am now sure: Coldplay is the best band in the world. Many may agree with me. Come on and buy their CDs so you can agree with me too. Good luck, good listening! I know there are only 10 tracks in this CD, but they'll last like forever.
B00005NKK8|4.0|This soundtrack is perfect in many ways.   It has a wide range of music but sticks to the classics and oldies.   This is a good CD set for someone who enjoys like I said oldies and rock. Great songs like &quot;Respect&quot;, &quot;California Dreaming&quot; And even &quot;Mrs Robinson&quot; appear on the cd's.   There is also some extra tracks only on the cd version of the soundtrack.   This is a great cd to add to your collection if you like rock, oldies ,and just enjoy good music.   The movie is great too! Pick them both up it's a good buy the cd with see plenty of play time trust me.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|I watch this movie and have to ask if the guys who did it had even seen the first one.  Oh, that's right, they wrote and directed it!  Getting more and more rediculas by the minute, we soon decide to simply laugh at the absurdity of what we are seeing.  When Neo confronts the Oracle about the Architect's prophicy, she tells him to ignore him, the Architect doesn't know what he's talking about.  But, but, didn't the Oracle send Neo to find the Architect in Re-Loaded?   Wasn't that the climax of Re-Loaded?  Well, i guess they need to find some reason to go back into the Matrix.  The Oracle then goes on to tell Neo that there are consequences to their descisions...what descisions? he asks, the descisions we make, she replies.  What? that dosen't make sence, don't worry about it, it's not supposed to, it's just a movie.  ......  <br />Anyway, whatch it for a laugh, because it is good for a number of them.
B00000JPH6|5.0|This movie is fun and exciting to watch!   there are so many different creatures in the movie that for an older movie are really impressive.   As with all of Jim Hensons work this movie is well put together and exciting.   It's hard sometimes to focus on what is going on because everything in the movie is so great.   All of the characters in the movie are made so well.   Like I said this is an older movie but you really can't tell because the special effects are great.   Grab a copy, some pop corn and enjoy yourself really watch the movie the sets, and creatures are amazing.   Enjoy!!
B0001906O0|5.0|1985, 5th grade.  The Smiths & The Cure made a HUGE impression on me ....<br />Ive been waiting for Robert to re-release the B-sides of Standing On The Beach on CD.  Already had most of the other B-sides on tape but CD is *SO* much better.<br />Those few songs that I havent heard already are great, especially<br />\\"To The Sky\\".  And classics \\"This Twilight Garden\\", \\"Harold and Joe\\", \\"A Few Hours After This\\" are great to hear over and over again.<br />Im also glad he released the movie songs \\"Burn\\" and \\"Dredd Song\\"<br />(didnt want to buy the soundtrack)<br />Starting reading the booklet too.  Very fascinating.
0783116934|5.0|This film is amazing.   Mainly because it is based on a true story about a real killer.   I guess this keeps you on the edge of your seat most of the time.   It also leaves you with a weird/sad feeling because you know all of it really happened.   It's not just some fake movie made up to scare people and earn money.   Over all the movie is made perfectly and flawlessly.   With a cast of great actors too.   This also helps to give the film a kind of realizm that you can only get from quailty actors.   <br />      The movie is graphic and violent but very interesting at the same time.   It really tells a indepth story of a everyday man living a seperate life as a serial killer.   The movie is very impressive, not for the faint of heart of youngesters.   With that said enjoy the film.
B000006NPY|4.0|Adore has to be my favorite Smashing Pumpkins album. It is nothing like what they became famous for, nor is it something you would expect from them. Billy Corgan again proves his greatness as a lyricist. He takes this album to a different level, and turns it into something that could almost be considered pop. The depths of his emotions run thicker throughout this album than it has with all the others combined. <BR>They were evidently experimenting with their sound on this album. They go from trying an almost dance-ish sound with songs like 'Appels + Oranjes' and 'Perfect' to a really odd with 'Tale of Dusty and Pistol Pete' and 'Annie-dog'. Most naturally for them is the dark haunting sound in songs like 'Shame' and 'Blank Page'. Then there are songs like 'Behold! The Night Mare', 'Tear', and 'For Martha' that are just so amazingly deep and emotional that it's hard to really be able to describe them.<BR>The most important aspect of this album, as is in most of their work, is not the sound, but the lyrics. Billy Corgan is a lyrical genius. Even if the song is completely horrible it's hard to deny that the only thing that could give it any hope is Corgan's words. They are incredibly deep and emotional. Combined with Corgan's almost haunting voice you can't help but to feel all the depth behind them. This album does it far better than the others.  <BR>There are songs in this album that could be considered really strange, but then there are the ones that are incredibly moving. You can tell through 'Once upon a time', 'Crestfallen' and 'Tear' that there is alot of built up pain in this man, and he conveys it in such a way that you can feel it just by listening to his words. This is how if a band is good at what they do. If they can make you feel what they felt when writing their song, then they've done their job.<BR>If you're a die hard Pumpkins fan, because of merely their sound then I believe you will dislike this album. However, if you're a fan more because of the genius that is Billy Corgan, as I am, you should love this. As for anyone who loves great lyricists, then I think this is an album you should have. Though, I will say if they could have cut a few of the songs and it would be far better.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Of course it's hard to understand why this movie is critically acclaimed and celebrated to those who are used to more commercial or semi-arthouse cinema.  What makes this film so charming and fascinating is the natural simplistic style of direction and smooth narration.  It deals with the themes of loneliness and self discovery without incessant pseudo-philosophical dialogue or cheesy arty drama.  I found it incredibly moving and truly innovative.  I've been to Japan myself and I feel that it really changed me for the better.  You realise just how big the world really is.  I feel that this film really captured the feeling of being lost in the midst of something big and having to find your way through.  It's simply beautiful and unlike anything else I've ever seen.
B00003CXI1|1.0|Harry Potter, hmmmm, where to begin. If you read my review for the book you already know What I think. Here we have a fine example of a promising cast that fails to deliver what the book did, except one thing, THE BOOK DIDN'T DELIEVER ANYTHING!!! Lets start off with Leading Man Daniel Radcliffe. He seems to be a nice kid but I am not going to lie, he is not a good actor. He merely says things and looks around, and then moves his body parts. It's not acting, it's just insulting the art of theater. I, in all my honesty, don't really think you care what so ever about the other actors, but in case you are wondering about Draco, who is played by Tom Felton, he does nothing but remind you of Karl Lagerfeld, and oh yeah, he acts like a total douche to everyone in the film, just like Karl Lagerfeld would do in real  life. Which, I guess if you like Draco, or merely dorks with greasey long blond hair,  at least that's promising. Hermione, ( FINALLY! we learn how to pronounce her damn name, I have been calling her hormonies for the longest time now) is played by the adorable Emma Watson. For Some reason, when you see Harry and Hermoine ( what is it with J.K. Rowling and the names that begin with the letter H, anyway? Does it have some thing to do with hell, maybe? Like it holds a secret message?)you are strongly reminded of Corey and Topanga from Boy Meets World. Let me just say that who ever got Rupert Grint only got him because for some reason, red hair is cool when you are intoxicated or high. That kid doesn't scare me becuase he is a red head, he just scares me. There is something about him that reminds you of leprechans or Garden Gnomes, like he is about to burst out of a box of Lucky Charms. Normally I would call him Shawn from Boy Meets World to complete the boy meets world joke but that would be an insult to Ryder Strong and his good looks and acting so, I must refrain. And of course, there is Professor Snape, played by one of the ever talented actors in the film AlanRickman. In this role, Alan Rickman resembles the Nine Inch Nails one and only one band member Trent. The only good actors are the adult actors in the film, but don't be suprised, most of the kids here are in their first role, or for those that aren't, it gives you a better excuse to avoid the film, and hope that they drop the whole series.
0345451325|5.0|I played the videogame before reading this book, which is basically the same as reading the second book in the series, The Flood, before the first (this one). I always found the story in videogame quite exceptional, yet I didn't even know half the story until I read the truly outstanding Fall of Reach. All of the battles in this book are so brilliant, so powerful, and so grand, it just leaves the reader with utter satisfaction.<br />You really get a sense of a large war and an intense struggle to fight against an enemy of such intelligence and brute force. Humanity really has its back to the wall. Fall of Reach actually just skims the surface of all the great plot twists, yet its character and story development are absolutely top-notch. The best 7 bucks I've ever spent on the internet.
B00005JMCN|5.0|For those of us that are tired of today's &quot;crank-em-out&quot; movie industry that has become the classless standard, Seabiscuit is a breath of fresh air.  I'd venture to say that Seabiscuit was one of the most underrated movies of 2003 with limited release in theaters in its opening week and overshadowed by Pirates of the Caribbean.  However, as time progressed, Seabiscuit gained speed and soon hit screens nationwide.  <br />The whole story is based within the Boom and Depression eras of United States history- three men, each struggling for happiness in their lives, come together and put their last hopes in one another- and one hapless racehorse. <br />Beautiful scenery, an inspiring story of second chances, and excellent acting make this movie a real winner.  You'll laugh, you'll probably cry, and you'll definitely not be wasting your money on a formulaic film that Hollywood likes to give us these days.
B00005RHGK|4.0|The first half of this movie is so tense and frightening that the second half is bound to be something of a letdown (the only ones that ever transcended this formula were Alien and Halloween).  But on the whole, though it sticks to the rural formula, the movie is very good.  The script is believable, they spare us the usual teenage sex subplot, and the director is smart enough to keep the monster hidden until the very end of the movie.  (Turns out that's not quite long enough, but we can forgive him).  Shades of both Texas Chainsaw and Spielberg's Duel, and some very original gross-out stuff that's pretty tastefully done.  For every hundred terrible horror movies, you get one good one, and I'd put this one in that category.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I'm giving my honest opinion when reviewing this CD.  I'm not a Britney hater- I give all music a chance and am a fan of many musical genres.  Please rate this review on how HELPFUL and DETAILED it is, not on whether you agree with it or not.  Everyone is entitled to their opinions, so please respect mine.<br />Britney Spears- the world's most controversial poster girl... But is she worth anything more than the occasional piece of juicy gossip? Her new album, In the Zone proves to be little more than overproduced formulaic dance tunes lacking emotion, substance, or musical ability. <br />Me Against the Music- featuring Madonna is a tune taking a stab at a dance pop anthem. It's too bad that neither of the girls have talented voices to carry this song. Lots of bass, a quick drumbeat, and growling moans by the pop princesses are the only appealing parts of this intro track. <BR>Rating: ** Two Stars <br />I Got That Boom Boom- featuring the Ying Yang Twins is another heavy bass track complete with Britney's whiny nasally singing voice begging you to look at her sexy body. It seems that Britney took a clue from Bubba Sparxxx's Deliverance in integrating a country/bluegrass clip at several places in the song- perhaps a fun idea but it doesn't really make sense on this track.<BR>Rating: * One Star <br />Showdown- A syncopated rhythm accompanies Britney's whispery voice infused with guitar and synthesizers. This is yet another \\"I'm sexy\\" self-righteous Britney song that comes off sounding quite cheesy with its reggae-inspired beat. Overproduction kills this tune along with the lack of any substance (the majority of the song is, \\"Here comes the showdown, what goes around comes around...\\"). <BR>Rating: 1/2* One Half Star <br />Breathe On Me- Sounds exactly like something you'd hear from Madonna in the early 90's. Britney moans and begs you to breathe on her. Definitely a sexy song, I give this one a better rating because it actually goes somewhere. Britney's voice fits in with this genre of music and she should probably focus more on it in the future. The beat drives the sexy flow and echoed voiceovers give the tune a surreal ambience. <BR>Rating: ***1/2 Three and a Half Stars <br />Early Morning- Britney turns a hangover into a lame toned-down dance song. Again, no substance. People get hangovers from drinking and dancing early into the morning hours from time to time, but this is a mess of a repeated background track and hissing vocals. Britney's trying a little too hard- what she thinks makes her sound like a naughty party girl really makes her sound like a dumb know-nothing. <BR>Rating: 1/2* One Half Star <br />Toxic- The intro (synthesized strings and drums) sounds a bit like something you'd hear off of Linkin Park's Meteora album. But soon you hear Britney's tinny voice break in and you realize you're listening to a poorly made pop album. There's a bit of old timey western guitar blended in at times. This, however, could make for a good sing-along song because it has a beat that makes you want to bounce side to side and the hook is easy to master (I'm addicted to you, don'tcha know that you're toxic, and I love whatcha do, don'tcha know that you're toxic?). It's very catchy, and for that I'll rate this song higher. For Britney attempting unsuccessfully to hit high notes, well... That'll lower the score a bit. <BR>Rating: *** Three Stars <br />Outrageous- Welcome again, overproduced heavy bass beat! Welcome again, self-proclaimed goddess Britney! I wonder if she can find anything to sing about besides her sexy body. Don't get me wrong, this song presents a nice dance beat perfect for grinding in the club, but the musical value is less than worth the money you'll pay for this album. Just wait until this track hits the radio waves and the dance floors and trust me, you'll get your fill of it before you know it. <BR>Rating: ** Two Stars <br />Touch of My Hand- Asian-inspired strings fill your ears during the intro to this track. Yes,this is a song about masturbation, eager listeners! Again, this track sounds a bit like something we'd hear from Madonna back in the early 90's. But Britney comes off once again trying a little too hard. True, it's something that most everyone does, but do we really need a song about it? Britney, some things should just be kept private, sweetie. Nice try, though. <BR>Rating: *1/2 One and a Half Stars <br />The Hook Up- We all know the radio hit \\"Baby Boy,\\" but this is a sad rendition of a reggae dance tune. It sounds so generic and unoriginal, especially with so many other singles like this one hitting the airwaves these days. Leave it to pop princesses to exploit a musical art and destroy its roots. <BR>Rating: * One Star <br />Shadow- A lot of synth brings you into this track. Could this be a ballad mixed in with all the trashy dance tunes on the CD? A good try. Comes off a bit strained on the high notes and seems a little overdone. Britney's voice isn't made for ballads, either. Effectively made me depressed. Not sure if it was the actual delivery of the song or the song itself. <BR>Rating: ** Two Stars <br />Brave New Girl- Wait a minute... I've heard this song before. Very much like Luscious Jackson's Naked Eye, Imani Coppola's Legend of a Cowgirl (both hits from the 90's) and some Madonna, Prince, and Hoku brought into the mix. Just when you thought everyone had forgotten about these new-age oldies! Sometimes the synth voice-overs garble the lyrics so badly you can't understand anything Britney is singing. But for Britney fans, that's nothing out of the ordinary. Still, it's a pretty catchy tune and sounds more sugary sweet Britney style than the rest of the album. If you're into her older stuff, you should like this song. <BR>Rating: **1/2 Two and a Half Stars <br />Everytime- Wow, another ballad! Wow, piano! This almost sounds like real music. And this song isn't overproduced. That in itself speaks louder volumes musically than the entire album put togethercan. You can actually hear emotion in Britney's voice on this one. The only thing that will amaze me more than hearing this song would be to find out that Britney actually wrote it. <BR>Rating: **** Four Stars
0156027321|5.0|This is one of my favorite books. It is a deeply moving story with a surprise ending that made me weep. It is a psychological portrait of how the mind deals with horror.
B000001G89|5.0|That Teresa Berganza is a great singer it is not new. But hearing her Carmen is almost a mystical experience.<BR>She  knows Carmen. She knows when she is seductive, and when she is wicked, when she is in love and when she hates.She makes Carmen hers.<BR>Domingo is a great Don Jose. We can feel his weakness and desesperation. La fleur que ti m'avez jetee is probably  his best in this recording.<br />And the orchestra directed by an inspired Abbado is glorius. And I have to say this because ussually Abbado is not my cup of tea. But I find this Carmen perfect.
0312263120|2.0|I did finish the book but I don't know why.<BR>It reminds me of a &quot;B&quot; movie script that was later novelized by a hack writer.<BR>But tastes differ - if you enjoy the first few chapters then you might enjoy it more than I did.
B000002HPT|5.0|Well, this CD differs quite a bit from Dream Theater's other releases, but that doesn't make it bad at all. Far from it. The band investigates new frontiers, much, I think, thanks to Sherinian. The songs on this one don't seem to be planned note for note, as you can get the impression of from their other albums. No, it has a more jamming spirit to it. Of course, that makes it maybe a trifle more simple too, but hey! I think of it more like &quot;leaving out the unnecessary virtuose show-off parts&quot;. I prefer good melodies to fast scales.<br />So cut the &quot;this isn't Dream Theater&quot; crap. These are some great songs! The favourites (well, I like all songs of course) are &quot;Hell's Kitchen&quot;, &quot;Lines in the Sand&quot; and &quot;Trial of Tears&quot;.<br />If you don't like this album, you aren't listening in the right way.
0812548094|4.0|I steer away from these massive concrete block o books series because most of them are so poorly written I fear devolution overtaking me before the end of the first endless volumn. Goodkind is different. Not that he's that good a writer, he isn't. But I would not be giving this book and all the rest in this series 4 stars if he was just the best of a very poor lot.<br />Goodkind has a great love for his characters, enough to get under their skin and explore just what and who they are and what they can be. He may repeat himself a bit but his world is a rich and solid place and given half a chance you will love it too, and the people who try to save it. Goodkind's style may be pedestrian 45% of the time but his imagination is prime and occassionally utterly inspired.<br />One thing I have not seen mentioned yet about Stone of Tears is how funny it can get. When Richard, the immovable object, is stuck in the palace of the gaggle of Sisters, some dark some light, his common sense is hilarious. Previously, Zedd carried all the humor of the series, but Richard is the better comedian. Them gals just don't know what they are in for.<br />If you don't usually read books like this, try this series, it may truly change your mind. As long as you give it time to get under your skin. It ain't Gene Wolfe--- but let's face it, absolutely nothing else is either. And it's tons sexier than Tolkien.
B000067DNC|5.0|As I noted in my Season 1 review, I had to watch this series in bits and pieces until (a) these DVD sets came out and (b) SCI-FI Channel picked up the series and delivered it to the masses.<br />Season 2 REALLY reveals a lot more of the important plot lines which, thankfully, have been faithfully carried through Season 7 (or 8 -- SCI-FI really messes with season numbers).  You will absolutely benefit from watching this set from start to finish, as it will reveal the To'kra relationship from the beginning, including the introduction of Sam Carter's father (who takes on a To'kra as a carrier).  The episode from the 60s is great too (EVERY sci-fi series has a time travel episode or two, right?!).<br />I have not yet had a chance to look over the DVD featurettes, but I can tell you that having 5.1 surround sound on this set is MUCH BETTER than with Season 1.  I tried out Season 1 on my new Sony HTIB system (5.1/DTS/Dolby Digital -- nothing fancier than a standard HTIB), and I was really hating the fact that it didn't have surround sound.  The Season 2 set has Dolby Digital compliance, I believe, and it sounds much richer.<br />I will note that the 5.1 effects are NOT &quot;woosh - bam - whizz&quot; sweet like in recent DVDs like T3 or Finding Nemo.  You really cannot HEAR the effects of bullets or staff weapons moving behind you.  I've checked all the discs and my HTIB, and it just seems to be that the DVDs are encoded 5.1 but without any tremendous directional effects.<br />Ain't it great that the content makes up for the lack of sound effects?  On to Season 3!
B000089RVX|5.0|This CD is so different, so mood provoking, and so haunting!  Like the other person who left a review, I too have a very diverse range of music in my collection.  I love all types, BUT, the music HAS TO BE GOOD in order for me to add it, and this CD has definitely found a place amongst the others.  This style of music, with the rock and pop mix, is going to become the new and up-in-coming style!  Who knew that this unknown band would be the one to introduce it?
0385504209|5.0|For years I read and loved Ludlum thrillers.  Finally, I gave them up both because I felt his writing style had deteriorated and because I was not learning anything while reading them.<br />With The Da Vinci Code, Dan Brown has re-introduced me to the thriller.  In the process, he has provided more interesting and thought provoking information than one can get in most &quot;serious&quot; non-fiction works--symbology, the number phi, church and Biblical history, the Knights Templar, Freemasonry, etc. etc. etc.  The challenge is figuring out where the facts end and the fiction begins.<br />I am anxious now to read Angels and Demons as well as to explore some of the topics Brown has raised.
B0000CAQ26|5.0|This CD goes everywhere because it's been everywhere.  I don't think I've heard an album so eclectic -- and so good -- in a generation.  I mean it.<br />Ignore the mediocre reviews that damn &quot;Try This&quot; with so much faint praise.  These are the same people who couldn't hit a curve ball in high school.  They weren't ready for the punk, ska, acid rock, blues, soul, etc., so they just lumped it all together because that's what they thought they heard.  Worse, the CD's often neatly summed up as &quot;Pink's the new 'front' for Rancid,&quot; and so on.  On the contrary, the album is quite succinct in all its styles and overlaps musical genres in all the right places.<br />If you liked &quot;Get the Party Started&quot; you'll find &quot;Humble Neighboroods&quot; even more incendiary. And no doubt &quot;Trouble&quot; is by now the hit single off &quot;Try This.&quot; I'm glad I was sitting down when I first played it.  I admit &quot;Trouble&quot; would be a mediocre tune for just about everybody else but I guess Pink ain't everybody else.  She shouldn't be allowed to pull out all the control rods on the opening track of a CD and get away with it but that's sort of her story, anyway.  The CD gets even hotter well into the last half, and the last tune, &quot;My Story,&quot; is darkly funny and sort of sad (and it's not really about Pink).  I don't know if I want to be on any bridges Pink's crossed recently any time soon.  She doesn't seem to have any friends from the old school -- if you know what I mean.<br />&quot;God Is a DJ&quot; may be her best lyrics to date.  Pink really is a poet without portfolio -- and that's only because they don't give too many of them out for street language.  That's too bad  because &quot;God Is A DJ&quot; is meaningful as the artist turned spectactor in order to find spiritualism.  There's also not as much of her &quot;bad childhood&quot; on this CD, either.  I think we all need a little rest from that, yet she still put plenty of badgirl on it, anyway.<br />And no matter what you may have heard, Rancid and Pink work extraordinarily well together here.  You don't think of either of them to be egoless performers, especially Pink, but their collaboration is notably &quot;subtle.&quot;  That's something else no one's exactly accused them of, either, and in this Rancid's expert guitar playing is the other big star of this album.  From what I've seen I don't think Rancid's videos quite do them justice.  This CD does and I'll soon be buying more of their work,too.<br />Some reviewer in Canada said that Pink's the best around because the competition's so mediocre.  That may be true but this is a bright woman with good musical sense who realizes that to be on the cutting edge you have to be the cutting edge.  Perform without a net, or whatever it takes.  Gee...I guess that's bad news at Wal-Mart but it sure is good news for my record collection.
B0000UJL96|4.0|A worthy dvd to the collection.  I only have one other dvd of a Star Trek movie and that is the collectors edition of &quot;Wrath of Khan&quot;.  Six is my personal favorite as I think it is the most exciting and allegorical of the movies.  It is a commentary on the post cold war mentality in the ladder-half of the twentieth century and the fall of the Soviet Union put into a Star Trek setting of human federation members dealing with their classic Klingon enemies in a more realistic vision than black or white.  This film is an espionage thriller set in futuristic outer space and has the same intensity as &quot;Hunt for Red October&quot;.<BR>After a horrid turn it made with the poorly concieved, unreflective, supposed finale, &quot;...V: The Final Frontier&quot;, <br />Nicholas Meyer, a mild fan of the series, who had directed what is still the most beloved of the series, &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot;, was asked to direct the original Trek crews legacy out of this tight spot.  Meyer, I would credit, as an outsider of the hard-core fanhood, who with objectivity, thematically enhanced the series by pushing the allegory of life at sea with being abord the ship.  He is a terrific writer and he had a lot of literary knowlege to insert and he does it professionally for how he studies up on the star trek universe and reads into aspects of it that were not given a lot of thought.<br />Aside from this films amazing amount of profound satire, homage, and allegory, it stands as a brilliant and consistant concluder by it bothering to remember the hisory of the movie series and shows that actions in previous films have concequences in the end.  This would be even more true if they not chosen not to replace a familiar character, who was intended to make a very dramatic turn, with a new character whose bold decision has less impact given that you just met this character.<br />The &quot;Next Generation&quot; series of movies have about as much connection with eachother at the JamesBond movies do when watched back to back.  If you want to watch the &quot;Original Crew&quot; movie series in a way that feels like a saga of connected story line like &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; series does, the perfect Trek movie line up is, II, III, IV, and VI.<br />And by the way, I didn't buy the previous edition of this DVD like many people because it looked like it was struck off the same master as my VHS copy was.  Now the movie is very well mastered with much better light and color.  The widescreen presentation has finally been centered and the subtitles(translating Klingon) within the picture.  For all you nittpicky widescreen purists (me included) who were curious why all widescreen versions of this movie aren't as wide as the scope ratio 2.35:1, I have read from multiple sources online that this movie like all the other Trek films was presented on the big screen in scope, but unlike the others, it was filmed and executed in the, then experimental, non-anamorphic, super35 format which is 16:9 and was matted out at the top and bottom when in theaters. While inconsistent with the format of the entire movie series, this is the maximum image composition director-approved presentation.  I believe all three of the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; movies were made this way too only they have spawned scope widescreen editions and fullscreen editions that are both as incomplete as eachother in opposite ways.  It's frustrating, but this is how they are shooting the majority of scope-shaped movies today. They want them to be versitile, which accounts for the lack of dynamic screen composition.  Anyway that was a bit unrelated, but I just thought it would be worth clearing that issue up.<br />The extras are good too. Good commentary. <br />Good docs complementing the cold war issues of the film.  Some <br />Behind the scenes documentary footage during the filming but not enough. <br />Like many of the Trek &quot;Collectors Edition&quot; DVD's the <BR>Menus are a little too silly for my taste.  They make it look too much like a playstation game. Be Simple.
B000003TA4|5.0|This album is just fantastic! It was really kind of a shock when I first heard Cobain's voice- strong and hmm very original... each song has it's own climate- famous Smells Like Teen Spirit, silent Polly next to loud Territorial Pissings, also silent and relly nice SOmething in the Way close to Endless Nameless, although seperated with 10 minutes silence. I don't think I will ever listen to such a good part of music. Each time I listen to this album I have this nice feeling of listening f something really good, oryiginal and honest!
B00005JLKB|5.0|My daughter last week gave me Season One to watch.  I didn't watch the show and understand it is in the Third Season.  I'm hooked.  After watching episode 21, I'm can't wait to see what happened.  When is it coming out?
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Bill Murray plays a burnt out man.  Someone who has tons of apathy and absolutely little soul left.. but somehow, he finds his keel of being in this movie.<br />A lot has been said about BM acting in this, but the directing by Sofia Coppola is brilliant, and I think she has a very good future.  The lenses used and the position of the camera really make for the emotion of the actors to come through.  The blurry backgrounds, neon lights... all good stuff for a movie that needs to have elements to prop up a totally emotional film.<br />All in all, if you are expecting a howl of laughter from Bill Murray, you won't get one here.. you will giggle from time to time because of BM's affable character that he brings to life in every scene that he is in (especially the commericial out takes) but you will find an actor that is really fun to watch and enjoy in this movie.<br />Have fun.
B000084T18|2.0|Why I give it 2 stars?<BR>Because Nate Dogg appear on this cd (Why? I don't know!) and the tracks &quot;In Da Club&quot; &amp; &quot;21 Questions&quot; are ok. If the remix of the bad the song &quot;P.I.M.P&quot; (feat. Snoop!!!) appeared, i thing this album can be better...<BR>But the real P.I.M.P (BIG Snoop D.o.gg) is not on this cd and my rate hold on the hand of Nate Dogg who is the saviour of this album.<BR>Dre may put a Westcoast rapper and it's Nate Dogg who rap in this lp.<BR>A question:<BR>Why Dre loose the Westcoast style and join the east coast style?<BR>Dre may publish an another cd like 2001 to stay what the legend say on him...
B000002JSP|5.0|well, i have been buried this album for several years<BR>since i bought it. maybe,it kept for 4 or 5 years<BR>the moment, i played this album first time...<BR>it made so down. i talked my self \\"what a leak album,ever\\"<BR>but, as times go by i need some more interesting sound <BR>so i used to listen the other albums like \\"metallica\\"stuff<BR>and \\"megadeth\\" and \\"death\\" of course,i love \\"beatles\\",<BR>\\"jason becker\\"or\\"bob seger\\",\\"the eagles even <BR> \\"frankzappa\\"stuff...\\"limp\\"stuff,\\"classic jazz\\" ,too <BR>yes, they were come to great feeling. yes! they did!<BR>hahaha ^^ but, finally, i blown up the dust on this album <BR> and played, the response was  \\"what great effort,ever!\\"<BR>why didn't i recognized at these moment!!! <BR>just listen this album when you're in peaceful easy feeling!!!<BR>they gonna groove forever
B00005J6T0|4.0|True Blue can be a very complicated album depending how one looks at it.  If you were to pop this album into your CD player and listen to it from start to beginning, various questions might pop into your head.  The question that popped into my head was, &quot;Why, out of all the songs, is there one slow ballad surrounded by songs that make you wanna get up and go crazy and dance?&quot;<br />This album, released the same year I was born, has a turning point for Madonna (as all of her albums usually do.)  The album displays a time in her life when marriage was a huge deal.  &quot;Papa Don't Preach&quot; shows traces of her rebellious ways and &quot;Open Your Heart&quot; shows traces of the attitude of, &quot;Don't worry about what others think, I love you and that's all that matters.&quot;<br />If I was to re-name this album, it would be &quot;True Love&quot; because the entire album displays the nature of human love.  &quot;Live to Tell,&quot; the better song, is the slow ballad on the whole album.  Madonna speaks her mind about lies, deceit, and sadness.<br />Summing up, if you are not very familiar with Madonna's work, I wouldn't recommend that you judge her talents on this album.  (Not that she didn't do a great job.)  My point is, True Blue is a very symbolic album that needs to be looked at very closely and wtih compassion.
B000006TRV|4.0|This is quite possibally Pink Floyd's best, in my opinion. The music is very well composed, the story is great[yes, this album dose have a story], and the lyrics fit each song well. It dose, how ever, get a 4 out of 5 because of the price. $27-31 for a 2 disc set with 26 songs all together, Both discs put together has a running time of about 60 min. But overall, Pink Floyd's The Wall is awsome.
6301174240|3.0|Man in the mirror is the only reason why I brought the video.  Then to see him in concert... that was disappointing.  Then I just seen clips of some of his greatest songs ever made.  The video is a big tease to the imagination to those who will love to see, what Michael Jackson really was before he got himself caught up in all this trouble.  I really regrett buying this.  The best part of it is, Just leave me alone.  Which I will do this tape.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I watched this Sunday's Super Bowl and was astounded by Josh Groban's amazing voice when he sang his glorious song &quot;You Raise Me Up.&quot; He sounds like a real veteran! And he's only 22! Even though he's still developing as an artist, I'm sure he'll stay around in the music industry for awhile.
B00006IU73|5.0|This is the first time i heard PT,and it is beautiful!!!One of my favourite CD&quot;s,next to Marillion &quot;Brave&quot;.
B000005GWE|3.0|After the success of Grace Under Pressure, it is not surprising that John Scofield again decided to accept the challenge of recording with another top-flight guitarist. At the time of its release, Scofield stated that the title of this recording was meant to reflect the regard he and Pat Metheny held for one another's (different styles) of playing. The challenge of the project was to establish whether their styles were compatible, creating interesting contrasts and stimulating improvisation. The end result is a not entirely successful outing for the leader. He and Metheny largely share the writing credits (bassist Steve Swallow contributes two titles) and the compositions are generally attractive and give the soloists enough ideas to work with. However, the rhythm section of Swallow and drummer Bill Stewart does not quite ignite Scofield the way that Charlie Haden and Joey Barron/Bill Stewart previously did. Swallow is a fine player but his acoustic bass guitar does not project in the manner of Charlie Haden's or Marc Johnson's acoustic basses. Further, Haden's ability to push his collaborators into exploratory territory is extremely rare and justifiably celebrated. And whereas Scofield flourished in partnership with Bill Frisell on Grace, he is, frankly, blown out of the water by Metheny. There is no shame in this, for Metheny is perhaps the greatest melodic improviser since Sonny Rollins and his solos on `The Red One' and `'One Way to Be' are simply magnificent; they alone justify purchasing the album. Scofield's solos, by contrast, seem a little flat and stifled; it is as if he cannot quite find a way to reach a plane of heightened freedom and expression. Nevertheless, Scofield deserves great credit for having the courage to pit his skills against a player whose gifts arguably exceed his own. Too few in the jazz world of today are prepared to take such risks.
0345452577|2.0|This is so wordy and difficult to read, that it wasn't even worth finishing.  I was VERY disappointed in this author, since I usually enjoy his writing.
B0000VCZKM|4.0|Annie (Aileen Quinn) lives in a rundown orphanage managed by Miss Hannigan (Carol Burnett), who hates little girls.  Miss Hannigan works the girls from dawn to dusk and locks them in the closet when they misbehave.  Living at the orphanage is pretty bad, but living on the street during the Great Depression is worse.  But Annie doesn't let her circumstances get her down, she knows that she has loving parents out there somewhere and she is determined to find them.  After getting caught escaping again, Miss Hannigan is determined to punish her, but Annie is rescued by Grace Farrell (Ann Reinking), Oliver Warbucks' (Albert Finney) private secretary.  Turns out that Mr. Warbucks hosts an orphan in his home every year and this year Grace decided that he needed to host a girl.  Mr. Warbucks soon finds his home and his life turned upside down by this lovable girl and her sunshiny disposition, but Annie still believes that her parents are out there somewhere and may give up her one chance at happiness to find them...<br />This is by far my favorite version of Annie and I adore most of the songs that are in it.  It is true that they changed the story from the musical and left out a couple of songs, but they just kind of took out all of the political stuff, which most children wouldn't understand anyway.  Annie definitely has the feeling of the Great Depression era though, especially through the costumes, which are very dingy and dull looking.  However, the actors really sparkle in their roles and do a wonderful job.  My favorite is Carol Burnett as Miss Hannigan - she is hysterically funny!  Tim Curry as Rooster and Bernadette Peters as Lily also have some great presence and were fun to watch.  It is true that the musical is cheesy and smarmy and all of that, but I love belting out the songs with the singers and always feel good after I watch this movie!
B00004SU5J|5.0|Quite simple. Before this album, nobody did it. After this album, a new story has started.<br />After the first time I listened to it I was sure I have never heard anything like it. You have to listen to a really good CD a few times to discover its quality, but in &quot;Tourist&quot; it is easy to find you are listening to something totally different.<br />I have read to many other reviews and it's amazing to see everybody can find distinctive elements in this album. In my opinion, I think we are in front of a new style and sure it will mark tendencies of a lot of future recordings.<br />Every one of the songs have something new. Mixtures of jazz, funk, disco, salsa, indie. A perfect combination. &quot;C'est comme ça&quot;.
B00005JMTN|4.0|Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) has been estranged from his father, Edward Bloom (Albert Finney), for quite some time.  Living in France with his pregnant wife, Will hurries home when his mother (Jessica Lange) tells him that his father is dying and that it is only a matter of time.  Will tries to have some serious conversations with his father about who he really is, but all he can get out of him are these tall tales that used to entertain Will when he was a child, but now that he is grown up, he doesn't believe in them anymore.  There are stories about a young Edward Bloom (Ewan McGregor) having the golden touch in his small hometown and winning at everything.  Stories of how he lured a giant out of town and fought his way through a swamp to a forgotten Eden of a town.  Stories of how he worked for the circus and won the information about the girl he fell in love with at first sight.  So many stories, but all of them so fantastical that they simply couldn't be true!  But as his father continues to slip away, Will comes to realize that there is some truth in every story and that, given the choice, wouldn't we all prefer the story with a little bit of magic woven in...?<br />Big Fish was an unexpectedly charming drama that was not quite as fantastical as I envisioned given the previews.  It is very much a father/son relationship movie and it was sweet to see both the father and the son come to some important realizations in the film.  The Blooms are a very loving family and Will's parents were still madly in love when he died, which is so refreshing to see in a film these days.  Of course, we see Edward Burton's touch mostly in the flashbacks where Ewan McGregor plays Edward Bloom as he has so many amazing adventures and these sequences really added to the film and made it something special instead of commonplace.  If you are looking for a sweet little drama with a touch of something different, then this is a wonderful film with a great cast that will make you laugh and cry - take the whole family!ry - take the whole family!
B000000WG4|4.0|And sure I will give it only 3 stars in twenty years time. I am 30 of age, as this album is. In the time it was recorded, I will give it 6 stars. <br />You know, it is really impressive how can a teenager can make this album out and in such a dull music era like the arly 70's. But the fact is that it doesn't resist the passing of time. It is really obsolete now. Arrangements are null (okay, you can say innocence and purity are first), but I can remember of some good albums of 1973 that had masterful arrangements (haven't you heard about Alan Parsons?).<br />It is an example of virtuosity, creativity and freshness, but having listened to a lot of music brings up to me some questions: <br />Why you can keep on listen to classical myths like Bach, Mozart, Beethoven and even Prokofiev and Stravinsky which sure will be inmortal and Tubular Bells seems out-to-date?<br />Why some types of music can be &quot;revisited&quot; like jazz, disco and even some pop stuff and Tubular Bells has had three awful self-copies? TB II is decent, TB III is a cheap copy.<br />I really liked this album but it seems to me it is descending slowly in my personal list.
6305784116|4.0|Madame is a wealthy, single French woman who dotes on her cat, Duchess (voice by Eva Gabor) and her three kittens, Marie, Berliox and Toulouse.  Madame knows that she is getting older, so she puts together her will, leaving her estate to her beloved cats and nothing for her devoted butler, Edgar (voice by Roddy Maude-Roxby).  Horrified that his years of service earned him nothing and outraged that Madame would choose to leave her fortune to her cats instead of himself, Edgar drugs the cats and leaves them in the countryside.  Duchess is not sure what to do or how to survive in the country, but she soon finds a gallant rescuer in the form of O'Malley the alley cat (voice by Phil Harris).  O'Malley was initially attracted to Duchess because she was beautiful, but, as they continue their travels and he comes to get to know her and her children, he starts thinking of settling down and leaving his footloose and fancy free life behind.  However, the cats still do not know that Edgar was the one who tried to get rid of them, so even when they do make it back to Madame's mansion, they still are not safe...<br />The Aristocats is a charming Disney film with that classic, old time animation style that Walt Disney became known for.  All of the fun Disney characters are found here, including charming (and scene stealing) supporting characters.  My absolute favorites are Napoleon and Lafeyette (voice by Pat Buttram and George Lindsay), who were hysterical as country dogs who chased Edgar.  Roquefort the Mouse (voice by Sterling Holloway) was also charming as a little Sherlock Holmes who solved the mystery and foiled the villainous plot.  There is not as much singing in this film as in other Disney cartoons, but what there is is a fun introduction to jazz for younger viewers.  This movie is completely safe for the whole family and I think that children of all ages will delight in the adventures of these intrepid cats.
0385504209|5.0|The Da Vinci Code is a well-written suspense novel that is a fun and engaging read.  To claim that an 'educated' person would not like the book is quite false.  Many of the most intelligent historians I know truly enjoyed it, along with nearly half my class at Harvard College.
0060537639|4.0|I immensely enjoyed reading Gavin Menzies's book. Unfortunately, Mr. Gavin's book is based on circumstancial evidences. The \\"unconvertible\\" evidences, Admiral Zheng He's records of voyages logs and charts, are missing from the picture. Some readers complained that there is no \\"smoking gun\\" that proof Zhen He's fleet sailed around the world in the early 1400's. I have to agreed with this assesment even though I am a Chinese myself.<br />Historians have widely accepted that Admiral Zheng He's records was destroyed or burned by the Confucians-Officials during the Ming Dynasty. Amazingly, no attempts were made to locate these records of Zheng He's fantastic voyages, despite the official history have merely said that the records disappeared from the Imperial Archive under dubious circumstances. The official history even described the circumstances of the disappearance and who was responsible for it. <br />Here is my rough translation of the official account of the records' disappearance:<br />... Emperor Hong Zhi was a frivolous adolescent boy who likes to play with treasures. One day, when Liu Da Xia was the Secretary of Transportation, someone suggested to the Emperor that he should emulate his ancestor Emperor Zhu Di by sending a fleet to the Western Oceans to bring back treasures for him to play. The Emperor asked the Secretary of Defense Xiang Zhong to examine Zheng He's old records. The Defense Secretary sent an assistant to the Emperial Archive to retrieve them.  Liu Da Xia rushed to the Archive first and hided the records. For three days, the assistant couldn't find them. As it happened, Xiang Zhong has other business to attend to and the matter was dropped. Later, when Xiang Zhong questioned his assistant: \\"how could the records have disappeared?\\" Liu answered: <br />\\"Zheng He's voyages to the Western Ocean cost hundreds of thousands of dollars of food and material and lost tens of thousands of lives. Even though he returned with treasures, the voyages are stillnot worth the cost. If the records are still there, they should be destroyed. Why bother to pursuit this matter further.\\" Xiang Zhong reflected upon what he heard and felt the same way. He got up and bowed to Liu, pointing to his chair and said \\"Your virtues are not small; someday it will be yours.\\" Later, Liu did become Secretary of Defense based on Xiang's recommendation ...<br />Clearly, Xiang knew Liu hided the records. He helped Liu along by reporting to the Emperor that the records were lost. At that time, Ming Dynasty was nearly bankrupted due to reckless spending by the court and rampant corruption of the officials. Both Xiang and Liu have very good reasons to dissuade the young Emperor from making another expensive expedition to the Western Oceans.<br />Liu Da Xia is venerated by Chinese people as a compassionate, upright courageous official. He had risked his life to fight <BR>corruptions. He is not a stupid and ignorance official some historians would like us to believe. Confucian-Scholars-Officials pride themselves to be the guardians and maintainers of Chinese cultures and history. Burning and destroying historical records simply do not fit in with their beliefs. Some modern scholars attacked Liu as the most stupid person in Chinese history for \\"burning\\" Zheng He's records. In truth, he saved the Ming Dynasty from imminent disaster. His actions probably saved the records from actual destruction by somebody else. <br />Here is an account on how he became the Defense Secretary:<br /> ... On the seventeenth year's reign of Hong Zhi (1504), the Emperor asked Liu Da Xia to be his Secretary of Defense for many times, but Liu decline the appointment every time. Finally, the Emperor asked Liu: \\"Why did you refused all my requests to be the Defense Secretary? Liu answered: \\"It's because the people are now desperately poor and treasury is broke. When rebellions began to appeared, it will be my job to suppress them. I am afraid my ability is not up to this task.\\"The Emperor was shocked. He asked: \\"How could the empire became like this? I though the taxation is fair and orderly, since the empire was established?\\"  Liu answered: \\"The problem is that taxation was not fair and orderly. Each year the state demands tens of thousands of dollars of wood and medicines from the provinces. Even just the small items like these, the costs run into tens of thousands of dollars. You can imagine what other items are like.\\" The Emperor then ask about the situation of army, Liu said: \\"The soldiers are as poor and wretched as the people, because the officers deducted at least half of their pay.\\" The Emperors issued many edicts to ban corruptions, but it was little effects. ...<br />For people who can read Chinese, please read the following stories about Liu Da Xia:<br />[...]<BR>[...]<BR>[...]<br />[...]<br />My point is that Liu was a highly responsible person and virtuous official. He could not have destroyed the records of Zheng He. In fact, history did not said he destroyed the records, but merely stated that he hided them. It is possible that the records are still exists somewhere in China, since there were no eye-witness accounts that they were destroyed. We should ask the Chinese government to locate Liu's descendants to search for clues of the records. Why keep looking for circumstantial evidences if the records could answer everything? Let's not beat around the brushes but search directly for the Zheng He's records. <br />The descendants of famous Chinese people are not hard to find, because the Chinese are proud of their illustrious ancestors and keeps extensive records of them. <br />Let's help find those amazing records. This is the Internet age. Everyone can be a detective in this game of life. Let's complete what Mr. Menzies has started. History should not be left alone for the historian. We could make history ourselves!rian. We could make history ourselves!
B00003CXA2|2.0|There's willing suspension of disbelief, and then there's this.  If you can accept that a developmentally disabled man with a talent for running and ping-pong can personally meet several presidents, George Wallace, John Lennon, and pretty much everybody else worth meeting between 1963 and 1979, this pat parable is right up your street.<br />It's all about how dumb luck and a good storyline can solve all your problems for you, and it's about as credible as the fairy tales your mother read you when you were this high.  The first time you watch it, it bilks you into thinking it's just a high-spirited fable, but the more times you watch it, the more you realize it's based on broad twists of fate and extreme leaps of logic, culminating in a moral so simplistic that Aesop would have laughed out loud at it.<br />Its success rests primarily in its having been made in the 1990's, a time when we believed we could accomplish anything by simple skill and sheer force of will.  We've moved past that time, and we have a more cold-eyed view on the world.  We now believe some things are beyond our control.  And this dusty leftover from the yee-haw Clinton era seems like a relic from the 1950's, for all its lyrical sophistication.<br />Go back to football, Forrest.  They still love you there.

B000001Y5X|5.0|This album was, without a doubt, the best album Manson has ever released.  Even if you hate him like I do, you'll still probably like this album if you haven't yet heard it.  This is what Brian Warner can write before he lets fame get to his head.
B000002MY3|4.0|good songs surprisingly. Everyone played this album out though. Where is she now anyway?
B00005JMGL|5.0|I loved this movie. It is literally the best PG movie I've ever seen. The only odd thing is that all but the main character, Peter Pan (Jeremy Sumpter), is British.
B00000IOSU|5.0|This has got to be the most depressing songs I ever heard, but I devoured every minute of it because I know all to well what sadness is like.
B00013PHGS|5.0|After following up their true masterpiece &quot;Moon Safari&quot; with the over-done and under-whelming &quot;10,000 Hz Legend&quot;, the best French chill-out band is back with &quot;Talkie Walkie.&quot; To me, this album sounds like a fairy equal balance between their debut's exquisitely plush sounds and the follow-up's icy distance in an addictive hybrid 44 minutes. In an added bonus, &quot;god of producers&quot; Nigel Godrich lent his vast skills to this album behind the board and immersed the album in a chilling, outerwordly sheen that has become a trademark for him, and suits Air's already celestial music very well.<BR>In the many times I have listened to it since it's release, I cannot name a weak song: &quot;Venus&quot;, &quot;Cherry Blossom Girl&quot; and &quot;Alone in Kyoto&quot; stand out the first time, but this entire album is very strong, and a welcome return to form for this Parisian duo. Look for this album to be on many best-of lists come December (at least mine, for sure).
0393037010|4.0|First, it is not the movie.  Evidently the movie company chose the title from this, the first book of the series, because it is cooler than the one from which the movie was in fact adapted.  That one, evidently, had more plot.  But this isn't about plot.  What plot there is consists of Jack Aubrey's obtaining his first captaincy, meeting and befriending the man who becomes the ship's physician, and and a battle at sea.  And that's about it.  The rest is the details.  Rigging, sails, cannnballs -- you name it, if it's ona  sailing ship, it's detailed here.  Exquisitely. And that is the strength of the book.  The characters are also well-rendered, and the prose is excellent.
B00006F83Y|4.0|This is the first album by QOTSA that I have ever actually purchased, but I have been a fan since their previous release &quot;Rated R&quot;. I can tell you easily that this is by far one of the better rock albums to have been released within the past few years. Thier infectious hooks and unique method of song structure makes this album an intrigue to listen to. <br />Let's run through it track by track:<br />1. &quot;You think I Ain't Worth a Dollar, but I Feel Like a Millionaire.&quot;--9/10-- an excellent track to get the album kickstarted. Incredibly loud and fast-paced w/ lead singer/guitarist Josh Homme screaming almost every word as if he about to have an anuerism. One of the best tracks on the album.<br />2. &quot;No One Knows.&quot; --7/10-- The First single. Not a bad track by any means. The guitar work is clever and the bridge really adds spice to the song, but it can feel worn out after a few good listens. Still, a decent track.<br />3. &quot;First it Giveth.&quot;--8/10-- I really enjoyed the soft- vocals-on-top-of-hard-guitars mechanism used in this song. You have to let this song grow on you a little, but once you do you won't regret it. Another standout track.<br />4. &quot;Song for the Dead.&quot;--8/10-- Another hyper-actively  paced track. Very good if not a little on the long side. You can never tell when this song is really going to end (a trick the Queens play on several tracks in this album, but is very prevalent here).<br />5. &quot;Sky is Fallin'.&quot;--7/10-- I thought that this track was pretty good but it may be a little too harmonic &amp; oddball for some of it's target audience. Not bad, just a wee bit offbeat.<br />6. &quot;Six Shooter.&quot;--1/10-- Sorry but this track is complete drivel. Driven only by it's non-stop use of the &quot;F-word&quot;, this track is obviously filler, and poor filler at that.<br />7. &quot;Hangin' Tree.&quot;--5/10-- Another filler track, but it does have kind of a good beat to it. God knows its infinitely better than &quot;Six Shooter.&quot;<br />8. &quot;Go with the Flow.&quot;--9/10-- Probably one of the best (if not THE best) track on this album. It does a great job of blending sweet vocals, various samples, and some mild piano work- in a up tempo song nonetheless. Definetley a good reason to buy this CD.<br />9. &quot;Gonna Leave You.&quot;--9/10-- Another excellent track. Simple, but nonetheless impressive. Another good reason to add this to your library.<br />10. &quot;Do It Again.&quot;--9/10-- A somewhat anthematic track that has somewhat of an old-school rock aesthetic to it and a great beat. A big standout on the album.<br />11. &quot;God is in the Radio.&quot;--7/10-- Good song with some excelent solo workings, but it suffers from the same length and ending difficulty that &quot;Song for the Dead&quot; does only to a larger extent. Not bad, but not for those w/ short attention spans.<br />12. &quot;Another Love Song.&quot;--9/10-- Short, sweet, simple. This seems to be the formula that works best for these guys. Another outstanding song.<br />13. &quot;Song for the Deaf.&quot;--9/10-- By the instant you hear the that first lead riff you're hooked. Another long track, but it is very well done and better put together then some of the others.<br />14. &quot;Mosquito Song.&quot;--7/10-- A nice, little acoustic &quot;diddy&quot; to wrap things up. The guitar working is great but the song can get a little repetious. Not too bad.<br />That's pretty much the sum of it. Although this album has it's potholes there are more that enough excellent tracks to make up for it. A must buy if you're into any kind of rock.
B0000YEEHG|1.0|Persona was made with a standard aspect ratio of 1.33:1, but the MGM DVD apparently has cropped the top and bottom of the film in order to create a fake widescreen image of 1.66:1.

0876855575|5.0|Charles Bukowski was a genius, and this book for me epitomizes great writing.  Succinct and to the point, honest and thought-provoking, without any of the superfluous window-dressing that most writers tend to clutter their work with.  It tells the story of the author's childhood, growing up in Los Angeles under the roof of an abusive father and an uncaring mother, in a world that utterly rejects him at every turn.  It is kind of a walk down memory lane, albeit a rather painful one.  Bukowski's characteristic stark and direct style is in full evidence here, and it works to magnificent effect.  This book describes the formative years of a man who rose from the depths of oppression and alcoholism and depression and a thousand dingy roominghouses and seedy bars and hardened whores to become one of the most celebrated writers of our time, soul intact.  After I read this book, I sat down at the computer and started writing myself for the first time (and haven't stopped since) - it was that influential.  There have been many imitators but there was only one Bukowski.  He was a visionary talent who revolutionized both prose and (in particular) poetry, in a passionate and sometimes almost violent attempt to bring the art of writing down from its traditional perch in the clouds and deliver it directly to the masses, honestly and without pretense.  The tale told in this book will make you laugh out loud, will make you  cry, will make you want to scream with redemption, because here is someone who is telling it like it is, without thought of consequence or effect, spilling his mind and his guts out on the page for everyone to see.  But most of all, like the life of the man himself, it should inspire you to tackle your own life with renewed vigor.  This is my favorite book from my favorite author - I couldn't recommend a book more.
B00008EY9G|1.0|that this is the movie the stupid brother in Adaptaion was writing? <br />Identity is an absolute waste of everything and it actually sucks more than I have let on...
038572179X|1.0|If this book's a masterpiece, I gotta start writing more.<br />Words, words, words. Then more words. (Did McEwan never read Elements of Style? Omit Needless Words?) There are so many paragraphs here -- so many pages -- that writers like Graham Swift and William Boyd could have dashed off with a single line, losing nothing. For example, THREE PAGES to dissect Cecilia's choice of a dress for the evening??? And in those pages, false lines abound, like -- &quot;...and though one bore wine stains and another a burn hole from her first cigarette...&quot; Ugh! (How about &quot;...and though one bore wine stains and another a burn hole from a cigarette (her first!) ...&quot;?)<br />I liked both Amsterdam and The Innocent very much. Wonderful, clean, direct writing, with interesting engaging characters. Before McEwan starts his next book, I suggest he reads less Jane Austen, and more Elmore Leonard.
0930289234|5.0|In my opinion Watchmen is an outstanding read.  Unpredictable, imaginative, original and compelling.  In fact I read it again as soon as I had finished.  I enjoyed it even more the second time because of all the details, links and hints that suddenly make sense.  This shows how much time and thought had gone into the writing and construction.  There is a lot to this book; just because it is a comic doesn't mean its low-brow and just for kids and geeks who can't get girlfriends!<br />I have had a look at other comics since buying Watchmen but none of them appealed to me at all, in comparison they all seem, well like stupid comics really!  In my opinion Watchmen is somthing else - buy it you won't regret it!

Soon michael's life will take a new turn when he discovers \\"a creature\\" with his friend Mina in his dilapidated garage. Many questions will be asked but they will have to wait since Michael's priority is to save the unknown creature. If the world of magic fascinates you then this book is highly recommended especially to young children, who would like to escape into the world of fantasy.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Don't waste your time. I never walk out of the movies, ever... I was very tempted with this one, but I stuck it through til the end. Biggest waste of time ever.<br />There is no chemistry, there is no spark. I thought the movie was very self-indulgent and the relationship between the two main characters wasn't developed enough. I didn't feel their connection, and this &quot;connection&quot; of their's is what the whole movie blathers on about.<br />I honestly have no idea what all the rave reviews are about. We must not have seen the same movie at all.<br />There are so many other great movies out right now... 21 Grams, Cold Mountain, Goodbye Lenin, Mystic River... Save your money or spend it more wisely on a better movie.
630522577X|4.0|My Fair Lady, Rex and Audrey et. al. was the scene of my first date. Gal would later become Miss P___. The DVD is clear full widescreen and has the extra two Audrey sung &quot;Loverly&quot; and &quot;Rain.&quot; Growing up I had Original London Cast with Julie Andrews, and this will always be the 'Real Thing' for me. Years later, I can appreciate the movie for all its intensity to capture the stage version. For me, It will always have faint echoes and as well as the ambiguity of Shaw's drama and its classical origins in myth. Hi Leslie! <BR>DVD should contain words to music as the original 33.3 record contained. But then, who remembers to follow the bouncing ball or Mitch Miller? Like good drama, good lyrics find print
B000002H97|4.0|Okay, some people talk a lot of crap about this album,not 2 many on this website though :-)<BR>This is an exellant album. It isn't thrash like their 4 previous albums(Those are great too,if not better)but it's still heavy metal and I like it. Call me crazy but the heavier songs remind me a lot of Pantera but,of course Pantera much more thrashy. But anyways, This is a great kind of heavy metal and their style had changed but at least they were all about the music unlike MOTLEY CRUE and POISON and all those crappy &quot;metal&quot; bands.Metallica was still the s**t and this album rocks.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm a huge fan of stories that are told right and told well.  Firefly sets the standard for both and more.  The show captivated me and it is a terrible shame that Fox decided it was better off without Firefly.  I don't have time for TV, but I make time for Firefly.  I am thrilled this show is on DVD and I hope, that by using my amazing powers of purchasing, I can help bring the show back.
080017948X|5.0|I watched this movie last night (on Groundhog Day, of course!) because it's one of my all-time faves, and always a treat. I loved it when I first saw it in the theater, and I've watched it three or four times now. Each time, I notice more tidbits that just add to the wonderfulness.<br />I won't go into details about the storyline, as others have already done so. However, I will note that not only is the script clever and Bill Murray's performance terrific, but the structure and pacing of the movie are almost perfect. Each time you go &quot;around the loop&quot; you get just enough new information to follow the story as new elements are introduced. There's not a wasted moment in the whole movie.<br />I know it's a cliche.... but I'd have to say that if you could only buy 10 movies to watch over and over again, this should be one of them.  It's that good, and it holds up that well. Think of it as a modern-day &quot;It's A Wonderful Life.&quot;
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I feel that this movie is well worth buying. This movie is for those that like movies that will put your mind to the test for comprehension and interpretation. I personally loved this film.<br />  I read a lot of the reviews that didn't give high remarks for this film and i have to say that it was quit obvious that none of them didn't even try to get into the movie at all. I only offer my opinions and thoughts of this movie. Some of you out there were just to damn critical and wrote as if you were getting paid for your words.<br />  For those shopping BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!! you will not be dissapointed.
630521610X|5.0|I thought this movie was pretty good and Wes Craven did a good job. They had a few secrets in it that you had to be a horror lover to notice. For instance the janitor that the principal yelled at Scream was chasing him, was wearing Freddy's sweater and the principal called him Fred. Also when Cindy was talking to Tantum she said that this wasn't some kind of Wes Carpenter movie. Well that was two different directors Wes Craven who directed Scream and John Carpenter who directed Halloween. Also it was funny when the guy sitting on the couch kept telling Jamie Lee Curtis that Micheal Myers was right behind her when Scream was right behind him. Of course he was one of the bad guys so Scream wouldn't have killed him. Courtney Cox played the typical snobby reporter who only cares for the well being of her carreer. The acting in this movie was excellent but before you see this one see Nightmare on Elm Street Halloween and Friday the 13th. And remember Mrs. Voorhees was the oringinal killer Jason didn't come until the sequel.
B00005JMFO|5.0|After reading the other reviews of this film,there is an awful lot of verbage which is totally unnessary.It is an excellent film as an adult movie,and totally a feel good,happy after effect which is carried out of the theatre.
B00005JMTN|5.0|This film has something for every type of movie fan.  Visually it is amazing.  The story is heartwarming and very entertaining.  This movie will leave everyone with a smile on their lips and a tear in their eyes.  It is a must see movie.  This film is soon to be known as one of the classic films.
0061015725|1.0|Being a big fan of Crichton (Jurassic Park, TimeLine, Andromeda Strain), I was excited when this book first came out. Having just read it, I'm now glad that I didn't rush out and buy it as I almost did. There are so many things wrong with this book! My number one complaint with the book, and the only one that I will mention here, is the liberal use of the F word throughout the book.  The Charlie character, who uses the F word in practically every sentence, is particularly annoying. Bottom line: dont bother with this book!
B00005JME0|5.0|I have to first off say that I never liked Ashton Kutcher, I really thought he had no talent, that he was a moron, etc.   Then I saw this movie and now I have much more respect for Ashton as an actor.   The Butterfly Effect lived up to it's hype.  If you're into movies like Requiem For A Dream (if you haven't seen this movie, you need to see it!), then you will absolutely love this movie.  The only thing I was disappointed at was that the trailer made it look like Amy Smart and Ashton Kutcher were madly in love over the years, but in the movie he comes back many years later to talk to her then loses her.   Overall, one hell of a good movie.
B000127LW2|5.0|I've always been a Star Trek fan but was majorly disappointed by Deep Space Nine and its copycat plot (Babylon 5 was much, more interesting, probably the best sci-fi TV show ever). Si imagine my delight when Voyager was launched! And the captain was...a woman! That was a serious departure from Captain Kirk's macho attitude and even from The Next Generation, where women were still assigned the \\"caregiver\\" roles (psychologist, physician). And Kate Mulgrew really delivered...oh, man, was she good! And she certainly didn't need to show a ripped physic and get into constant fistifights, unlike Enterprise's Scott Bakula...Also, the concept of the crew being isolated in a faraway galaxy, with a very slim chance of getting back home worked beautifully, making for some very compelling stories. No, you Jeri Ryan fans, Seven of Nine wasn't part of the crew in the first season...but you should check it out anyway, it's a real delight for any sci-fi fan.
0783114222|5.0|The praises of this series have been sung by others, and I heartily recommend this DVD to everyone, but I would like to make a few points, some of which are negative, but which don't detract from the immense value of this series.<br />(1) Without the development of the giant Saturn V Moon rocket, man never would have gotten to the Moon, and yet its development, unlike that of the Command Module and Lunar Module is not dealt with and yet its story was just as dramatic.  The problem of \\"combustion instability\\" and its solution is very interesting and took the lives of some excellent engineers but it is not mentioned.  It is interesting that Wernher von Braun, the head of this effort is barely mentioned or shown in the series, whereas he was a very visible P.R. man for the space program in the 1950's and 1960's.  I believe the producers of this series were aware of von Braun's past as a Captain in the dreaded Nazi SS and his possible (not proven) role in the war crimes involved in the production of the V-2 rocket in World War II and they didn't want to bring up this controversy.<BR>(2)  I give great credit to the producers for the episode about the development of the Lunar Module and the other episode showing how the astronauts were trained to become proficient geologists on the Moon.  Science and engineering are usually not interesting for the television viewer, and yet these things were made quite interesting.  My only complaint is that the engineers<BR>who worked on the Lunar Module are shown to be a bunch of lovable \\"nerds\\" who view the work as recreation, but in reality many engineers gave their lives as heroes, just as did the Apollo 1 astronauts, because of the immense stress due to the time pressure.  Others survived but had the marriages and family lives ruined.  None of this is really shown.<BR>(3)  The actors who played Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, the first two men on the moon, played by Tony Goldwyn and Bryan Cranston, put in especially superb performances.  Aldrin, the troubled genius, was especially well portrayed by Cranston who put in a lot of time studying Aldrin before filming commenced.<BR>(4)  The episode about Alan Shepard and Apollo 14 was quite good in showing how the flight controllers and the support teams led by Don Eyles overcame the Abort Switch malfunction.  Here real-time problem-solving was shown.  I was, however, disappointed that the Apollo 16 mission was not really shown because they had a more serious problem with the back-up Service Propulsion System which<BR>also had a problem and was quite solved in a similar way.  The Apollo 16 crew's exploration of the Descartes-Cayley site would have been quite interesting too because it was quite different than expected.<BR>(5)  The episode about the end of the program in Apollo 17 was both good and bad, the bad part being the story that Tom Hanks appears in about the filming of the early 20-th century movie about a flight to the Moon.  This was just a waste of time, in addition to the slander against Thomas Edison. There were more important things to show, in my opinion.  However, the end of the episode leaves me with tears in my eyes, because of all that had been accomplished in such a short time, and was then allowed to be thrown away because of short-sightedness.  I hope that the Presidents recent decision to go back to the Moon will be carried out because Mankind needs to look to the future and to continually expand his horizons.
0316666343|5.0|this is an amazing book, it's one of my favorites. i'm not going to tell you all about it, for i believe if you are going to read it, you are going to read it. enjoy, i did.
B0000UJL96|5.0|The reviews of the movie speak for themselves, but what makes this special edition is the retrospective view that it gives, taking us back to a time when the crew of the USS Enterprise was assembled on screen for their final appearance.  A touching tribute is given to the late DeForest Kelly, and interviews with the cast prior to the end of filming are a reminder of how long they had really been together and what they endured.  The sound is superb on the film, and the text commentary gives great insight into the making of the film as well as background information.  There are no new scenes for the movie, though there is an interesting cutaways during the Lt. Valeris interrogation.  A steal of a deal for the money, and every fan of this movie would be remiss to not own this version.
B0000VAFO0|1.0|With all of the money thrown into the special effects of this movie, you'd think it would be pretty good horror/scifi. But it's not. The plot's thin (and predictable), none of the characters is developed (why does anybody do what they do in here? sure, there are some reasons offered, but it feels as if somebody made this stuff up at the last minute because somebody else said, &quot;hey, you should have some characterization in here&quot;), the acting is ok but uninspiring. Absolutely, yes, everybody in the movie looks fabulous in leather (and everybody's under 20 except the ancient vampire), so if you like your movies in the violent eye-candy style with plenty of blood and slow-mo fight scenes, then this may be for you. I felt like I wasted the $4 rental fee on it; I'd suggest you rent it first before you blow this much money on a second-rate movie. If you like horror, try Ringu (the Japanese original) ---- truly frightening, without reliance on buckets of blood or really any graphic violence. I haven't seen the Hollywood remake, but the original was amazing. Or, if you're feeling adventurous, I really liked George Clooney's remake of Solaris. I saw the original Russian version, which had a lot of 70s Russian cinematic tics (like long, slow, pointless establishing shots and the overdevelopment of extremely minor characters); Clooney's remake is startlingly faithful to the original, which may be why so few people liked it --- the pace was slow, too --- while paring down the truly incomprehensible plot offshoots. If you can free yourself from your Hollywood expectations of how fast stuff should happen on screen, the Solaris remake is very good scifi. Good viewing!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|The story line is nothing entertaining, but acting is AWESOME.  Filming is also beautiful....but what I really love about this movie is that they show true-self of Tokyo as this high-tech/fashion city.<BR>Many people might think like \\"What? Tokyo is high-tech/fashionable??\\", yet it's true, you'd know if you lived there once like me, or the director Sofia Coppola used to.<BR>If you know the US is the richest country, who could imagine this country on the size of California is the second richest!<br /> Anyway, if you've been to Tokyo, this movie will make you miss Tokyo, and for those who haven't, it will make you wanna visit.
B00004RFDW|4.0|For the most part this movie is superbly acted and well filmed. Russell Crowe, one of the best things that ever happened to Australia, is perfectly cast as Jeffrey Wigand, the scientist whistle-blower who is fired from Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Company. Christopher Plummer actually resembles the character he plays, Mike Wallace of CBS Sixty Minutes. Al Pacino should tone down his shouting performance a notch or two, however. The movie got all kinds of nominations for Oscar awards when it was released.<br />So what's wrong with this picture? The same thing that's wrong with another Russell Crowe movie &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; and Oliver Stone's earlier movie about the Kennedy assassination. They are all--what an awful word--&quot;docudramas.&quot; The viewer is told as the credits go up at the end of this movie that some things have been fictionalized for the &quot;sake of drama.&quot; This is a cruel irony since the movie is all about integrity. Surely the &quot;real&quot; story of the cruel joke tobacco companies have played on an unwitting public for years would have been enough to intrigue an audience and sustain a hard-hitting documentary.<br />The movie is so well-done. I just wish I knew what is real and what isn't here--if we only had a fire wall between fiction and investigative journalism/movies in this country-- surely we are sophisticated enough to handle such a division.
B00004X0Q0|4.0|not a bad cd but not as good as vaya. anyone who hasn't heard atdi should. not to be mistaken as &quot;emo&quot; and lumped with promise ring or death cab for cutie. one of the few bands with such intensity and one of the best live bands i've seen! think fugazi with a little less punk and a little more rock. be sure to check out mars volta and stay away from sparta. we know who made this band rock!
B00000J7J4|5.0|This album is like an ice cold glass of lemonade on a warm summer day, absolutely refreshing.  There is not one song on this album that I did not like, which is very rare.  Usually when you purchase an album, it will only consist of 4 good songs, or 5 tops.  Not the case with this one!  Every song is beautifully composed and orchestrated by Santana himself, and wonderfully sung by his guest artists.  Supernatural is worth every penny, and now I see why it won Santana over 5 grammy awards.  If you like Santana's music, I guarantee you'll love this album.  I also recommend Shaman, by Santana.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|This concert is simply amazing. I don't know what else to say, it's all there and all the songs you want to hear are on this DVD. The only real problem is finding a time machine to go back and see it live.
B000002L42|5.0|It is amazing that a band which has worked in the studio for most of their career can sound so tight and inspired while playing live. Steely Dan, a band with practically no touring history, besides displaying their amazing chops, manage to breathe new life into some of the old classics, which is a real treat for the fans. Particurarly amazing is the arrangement of &quot;Reeling In The Years&quot;, with the horns taking on some of the guitar lines, and reworking them in a new way, while leaving the guitar free to soar to new heights. Another highlight is the guitar solo on &quot;Boddhisattva&quot;, which is simply ablaze with the flames of fusion. Fagen's keyboard playing is as brilliant and his voice as soulful as always. Another outstansing thing is the production - it is as clear and crisp as a studio recording. <br />A must for Steely Dan fans,  as well as jazz-rock and fusion fans in general - Steely Dan is a force to be reckoned with in both rock and fusion genres.
B00000K0EA|5.0|This is a very good Bond entry until the final half hour when the action takes over any sense of excitment. <BR>I' m also concerned about the scene where Wai-lin disposes of enemy agents with karate and lets them lay on the floor of her state of the art lab. What if they wake up ?!?<BR>Still, two excelent chase scenes (one involving a bike and a helicopter, another in a parking lot), an excelent performance by Pierce Brosnan and a suprising appearance by Q, more than make up for whatever mistakes take place later.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|So in this perfectly made indie film from a fear years ago we get nothing but wonderful acting from some pretty well known stars and a perfect script as well as some good affects for the film only being shot for like 4 million.  <br />We have a sick and delusional teenage boy trying to live his life through all the horrors of the 80s and being a teenager.  If that wasn't hard enough he starts having delusions of a big demonic bunny rabbit damned Frank.  Frank tells his he must do certain tasks to save everyone, because the world is comming to an end.  So Donnie is set on this path where everything connects so perfectly.  Does he save the world at the end, who is frank really?  Do we have free will, or are we fated?  <br />Yes, expect watching this more than once and plan on being open to many different interpretations.  This is one of those films where its fun to talk to someone about what you think it's really about and what's going on.  <br />Highly recommend it!  And the soundtrack is awesome as well.
B00000K0E5|5.0|Brosnan's debut as James Bond is pretty solid, after all, have you ever heard anyone complain about him playing, perhaps the most difficult part to cast in the history of film ?!?<BR>I love the part where Bond chases his plane off a cliff! When I saw it in a theater the audience spontaneously burst into applause. What a great way to introduce a new actor in this illustreous (I hope that's how you spell it) part!
B0000AQVCL|1.0|...Because this piece of crap doesn't flush very well.  I agree with every other 1 star review.  Jet rehashes every cliche known to mankind and then we are all in for a treat because the radio staions are all dying to make us listen to it 50 times an hour.  I have one friend that likes Jet.  That same friend likes Outkast.  I don't think were friends anymore.
0385504209|1.0|If you have a good education you will find it hard to ignore this authors continuous factual mistakes. If I am too harsh, I can only say that I am not used to reading such poorly researched text. The fact that so many people find it so well researched makes me wonder about the sorry state of education in our country.<br />I am on page 217 so far, and I am still trying to push my way though it. It is not easy, for it is also not terribly interesting.<br />And the Silas character, what is he he supposed to be? , some kind of Catholic secret agent with a license to kill?<br />Please. This book so far feels like a waste of time.
B00005JMCN|4.0|Occasionally, I'll return to a movie that I used to love when I was a kid (or just a few years ago) and wonder how I ever failed to notice how damn cheesey the thing was. One of my all-time faves remains An Affair To Remember, but I still have to grit my teeth through a few scenes of prissy dialogue and schmaltzy execution. Gone With the Wind verges on camp sometimes, but I can't pull the smile that stretches from ear to ear off of my face. That's somewhat how I felt when I finally caught the much-hyped Best Picture-nominee Seabiscuit tonight, and I find myself pleasantly surprised by it all.<br />          If you've seen the trailer, you know the jist: three men with various disappointments in their lives come together and collectively make the little racehorse that could, Seabiscuit, a national treasure. Well, I guess it's not necessary to see the trailer either - it's firmly based on a true story that was immortalized in Laura Hillenbrand's runaway bestseller of the same name. Director Gary Ross deserves credit for making a movie that always remains enjoyable, occasionally becomes unbearably suspensful (those racing scenes!), but ever so often becomes a little too treacly for its own good.<br />          The movie is pretty sound except for some of Ross's awkwardly written dialogue that comes off as heavy-handed and corny. A few times, I expected Chris Cooper's character to look into the camera and say in that gentle voice, &quot;If you watch this next double-take I do, you'll see a metaphoric connection my character makes between Red Pollard and Seabiscuit. Pretty damn clever, ain't it?&quot; Jeff Bridges rich-but-haunted Howard likes to say things that sound like they came from the signature of someone's e-mail account. And then there's Tobey Maguire's Red Pollard that quotes Shakespeare and makes us all feel smart for putting two and two together. You'll roll your eyes, guaranteed, but you also won't be able to shake the warm, triumphant tone of Seabiscuit that ultimately wins out.<br />          And that's how it all levels out. Seabiscuit is, overall, a kind of movie that you think you might have seen made in 1950 - it has the charm, nostalgia, and simple progression that is never challenging but always engaging. I really liked Seabiscuit, and that sounds like a dumb, non-movie-critic-ey thing to say. But that form of affection is what the movie evokes - sweet, beautifully shot, and one that will have you up and cheering for that climactic race. You'll probably have it all predicted and maybe even say some lines before they happen, but the two hours and twenty minutes will fly and you won't even remember digging your hand into that popcorn. <br />          We critics and avid filmgoers often tout difficult, disturbing works like 21 Grams and Elephant (neither of which I truly loved) and pooh-pooh on mass-audience fare like Seabiscuit. Yeah, Seabiscuit didn't get me thinking about the nature of violence in America or the metaphysical notions of the afterlife, but it got me thinking about horses, races, and good photography. I hardly consider Seabiscuit one of the five best of the year (as the Academy has) nor do I think it's a masterpiece, but I do consider it a welcome change and even somewhat of a fantastic film. GRADE: B+
B0001906O0|5.0|This is a must for any &quot;true&quot; Cure fan.  In an age when great music like this is sooo hard to find, it is a relief that this compilation came about.  I was in the UK when it came out, but figured I would pick it up at home.  That proved to be impossible, not one Best Buy, Circut City or Virgin Mega store had it...  Shows you Supply and Demand and the longevity of this incredible band.
B00001OH7N|5.0|Bowies most explosive album is not ziggy stardust!!!!!!!!! Its The Man Who Sold the World, people!!!  Stotty, trashy, quirky, everything that a rock record should be. I've never heard anything quite like it.  Way more than just than &quot;Bowie's heavy metal album&quot; as some people refer to it. This album helped inspire a generation of punk rockers to come. Take a listen, you won't be let down.
B0000025D0|5.0|Forget &quot;Born to Run&quot;. Forget &quot;Born In the USA&quot;. Forget it all for a little while. &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town&quot; stands alone as Bruce's truly defining album. It is his first foray into the dark side of life. It is the place where the characters in &quot;BTR&quot; ended up--a roadblock on Bruce's long highway. His optimism has waned and his perspective is bleak. Bruce is no longer lookiing through the eyes of a teenage rebel with a dream.<br />Despite the legal battles behind the scenes of this album that were quite the catalyst for his descent into darkness, it seems like it was the only logical way to go after embarking on the hopeful escapes in his first three albums. It was the natural progression of his maturity into the music. I would be so bold to say that without this record, Bruce Springsteen may have never reached the heights that this newfound lease on life provided him.<br />But...enough with my take on the importance of &quot;Darkness...&quot;. The songs speak for themselves on this record. I think the best track is &quot;The Promised Land&quot; because it is like the workingman's anthem, so to speak. It is Bruce declaring that even though he is living a desolate, machine-like existence just to get by in the cruel world, he still holds on to the dreams of the promised land. Another favorite of mine on the album is the title track. His passion in this particular song you can feel in your veins...literally.<br />But...the showstopper track has to be &quot;Racing in the Street.&quot; When I first heard this heartwrenching masterpiece, it gave me chills. I do believe that it is probably the most painfully beautiful song I have ever heard. The reality of it will floor you alone.<br />Overall, the anguish of Bruce on this record can be heard in every track. From the understated cynicism, to his angered and wounded cries and shrieks, this record is a MUST OWN.
B00008O31H|5.0|Make that 4.5 stars.  A really great band and a powerful record.  The only reason I give 4.5 instead of ten is because of the muffled sound quality on the record.  Definately worth picking up though.  Their probably one of the best bands out right now, if not the best. Even if your not into the blues, you'll still love this album.

B00014K5TQ|5.0|I really thought Macaulay was great but Green was brilliant!! This film should win all oscars! I loved when the credits came on. But it was a great story about pointless unconscious farts.
0385504209|4.0|This isn't the best book I have ever read, but it did keep me on my toes and I like that. I was totally shocked at the twist near the end and really liked Brown's historical viewpoints. I know that it is probably tainted with his own biased ideas but he made some interesting judgements and I like hearing other peoples perceptions. But that isn't the point, sometimes you read a book just to read a book! I love to read, and I don't have to completely love everything I read, simply finding something that sparks my curiosity or gives me new ideas is great. The best part about fiction is that it doesn't have to be picked over with a fine comb, it can just be read with the hopes of finding something entertaining. I liked most of the characters and the basic plot. I have read my fair share of suspence and mystery novels and I think this books scores pretty high on my personal list of favorites. I hope you can read it and enjoy it as well.
B0001611DI|5.0|Judging from the sales-rank, many of you (like myself) have pre-ordered the Dawn of the Dead single disc coming this March.  From what I've gathered, it represents only the THEATRICAL version with little or no special features.  Whether this is a way to spur interest in the re-release or just..uh, well squeeze as much from the market as is possible, is unclear.  <br />NONETHELESS, a 2 disc set is due for sometime in 2004 (apparently prior to Halloween).  According to a Fangoria report, the multi-disc set will include both theatrical and director's cut editions as well as audio commentary by producer Richard Rubinstein and possibly new tracks with Romero and Tom Savini. There will also be a sizeable still gallery with additional features yet to be announced.<br />I'm more excited about the 2-disc set and curiously peeved at the single-disc version.  But it's Dawn of the Dead, what'a'ya gonna do, they've got the good stuff and I need it.
0380002930|1.0|I did not enjoy Watership Down.  It hink that it was pointless to write a 400+ page long book about bunnies having problems.  It was way to boring for my liking. As a junior high school student this book was assigned to me. I do not suggest this book at all if you have the choice...Save yourself. This book did not reflect any of my interests and I disliked it alot.
055357342X|5.0|First of all I love this whole series.  It really is fantastic! However, I was really annoyed at the reviewer that stated we were afraid of saying this was better than TOLKIEN.  You my friend need to GET A LIFE! OK!  There is absolutely no reason to make that determination.  Tolkien invented the genre for heaven sakes.  Mr. Martin has had his influence and that of other fantasy writers and whatever else he is inspired by to help him along.  So you would hope that he could add something to what has gone before him.  I would agree that he has but I also feel it is a shameful waste of time to say that Tolkien is somehow less than Martin.  BOO!

B00005ATQD|5.0|This film is probably only worth 4 1/2 stars, but since so many other reviewers here panned it unjustly, I felt I had to give it five stars to balance the picture.<br />I never saw \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" on the big screen.  I was acting in a production of Shakespeare's \\"The Tempest\\" when it was playing,<br />and I remember other cast members calling it disturbing, irritating, skeevy, bizarre, frightening, and telling me I HAD to view it to get what they were talking about. Years later, I rented it on DVD.<br />I confess that I hated the movie, but for some strange reason, I also found that I could not remove my eyes from it until the last credit rolled. About a year later, I caught the beginning again while channel-surfing, and once again, I could not pull away from it. Only this time, I began to see that it may very well be a masterpiece.  It simply isn't what we're used to. The title alone has given me a lot to think about before I drift off to sleep at night, and I'll let you draw your own conclusions about that!<br />For film buffs, Kubrick's recreation of New York City streets in a London studio alone is worth the price of the DVD. The lighting and camerawork is high art, with weird, disturbing color-choices (all the light shown through windows is a bright but ominous blue). I almost hate to refer to a genius like Stanley Kubrick as ....-rententive, but \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" took almost two years of filmimg, with takes and re-takes to get every image exactly the way he saw it in his head.  That's not to mention the years spent on the screenplay and pre-prep.<br />Here's the kicker: American censors would only release the \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" with an XXX rating, which the studio thought would kill it at the box office.  Thus one particularly scary, long ....scene was transformed into a perplexing mess, with dark robes digitally added to the actors afterward.  No wonder SK checked out soon after it was ready to open.<br />Okay, the story, I'll leave you to discover, along with your own thoughts about the title.  Let it suffice to say that I am now somewhat addicted to watching & re-watching both my DVD copies (American and unedited European versions).  I only wish Kubrick were still here to keep creating this quality of movie experience.  I'd have given ANYTHING to have seen his version of \\"Artificial Intelligence\\".ur own thoughts about the title.

1401201911|4.0|I have enjoyed many of the Elseworlds books ever since the precursor, Gotham By Gaslight.  This is probably the best Superman title and one of the best overall.<br />A few hours difference in the arrival of superman's space capsule could mean landing half a world away from Kansas and that is the premise.  Superman has landed in the Soviet Union and has been raised by loyal Socialists.  Superman's presence in the Soviet Union drastically alters the future.<br />Superman rises to power despite the conflict of political ideals and the Warsaw Pact signs on new members.  We see the world change and see the lives of many familiar figures form the DC universe; Lois Lane, Lex Luthor, Batman, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, etc.<br />This is more than just a remake of the Nazi Superman (Ubermensch) as seen on Saturday Night Live.  The story is fairly believable and Superman is as true to his upbringing as in the regular DC universe.  The story progresses nicely until we see the final surprise plot twist.<br />A wonderful story for Superman and Elseworlds fans.
0393057658|5.0|This is not (as I mistakenly assumed at first) one of those splenetic rants by a so-called baseball traditionalist, bemoaning how the great game has been destroyed by filthy lucre. It is instead a vastly entertaining account of how one extraordinary man (Billy Beane) used his grasp of the imprecision of conventional measures of possible future baseball prowess to overcome his teams comparative lack of cash and assemble an extremely effective bank of young talent (albeit one that has, so far, failed to triumph in the post-season). The best baseball book I've read since Jim Bouton's \\"Ball Four\\" nearly 25 years ago.
B00008OWZC|4.0|For the past few years all I had of these 2 shows from L.A. June 1972 were audience bootlegs. Now, finally Jimmy Page has released the best of those 2 nights on 3 CDs. I am pleased with the song selection and sound quality, but I am alittle disappointed. Led Zeppelin performed 4 songs during the acoustic set, the 3 songs on disc 1 and Tangerine. For some reason, Jimmy Page didn't put Tangerine on this set. There was certainly alot of room on disc 1 for it because disc 1 is only 56 plus minutes long. The sound quality is a bit muddy in places but hey, these tapes are over 30 years old. It still sounds much better than the bootlegs I have. Over all, I like How The West Was Won. Disc 1 being my favorite of the 3 CDs. Highlights on this 3 CD set are &quot;Over The Hills &amp; Far Away&quot;, &quot;Dancing Days&quot;, &quot;The Ocean&quot;, and the whole acoustic set. Jimmy Page is slowly but surely starting to release the goods from the Zeppelin archives. The fist being the BBC Sessions. Disc 2 on the BBC Sessions is the real gem of that 2 CD set. If you want some really good live Zeppelin, get the BBC Sessions, listen to disc 2, hot stuff! Get How The West Was Won as well! There have been mixed reviews about this 3 CD set. I can see why. I too agree that there could of been more songs added to this &amp; also the over all sound could have been mixed better. But hey, its Zeppelin at their best &amp; us Zeppelin fans have waited a long time for something like this.

I personally rank it higher than Pearl Jam's Ten, and at least on par with Unplugged by Nirvana, and I love both of those artists and album's (the said album's are my favorite of those artists).  Although I wouldn't rank it quite as high as And All That Could Have Been by Nine Inch Nails (my personal favorite album ever) they are completely different genre's  <BR>The great thing about Audioslave is the fact that when your listening to it, you can easily here the Rage and the Soundgarden, but you get neither.  Instead, you get an incredible and vibrant mix of two incredible bands.  Tom Morello is one of the best guitarists ever, and with Cornell and the rest of the band, they form a great musical force.  <br />Another great thing about Audioslave is in guitar solo's and introductions to songs which have a distinct Rage sound, you never here a howl that de la Rocha would've added.  Sometimes, if one is a Rage fan it seems wrong, but you come to realize that Cornell knows what he is doing, and damn, he sure does.

B000000WA4|5.0|I don't know another album(s) that are as perfect, brilliant and genius as this.  This is what EVERY CD should be like ... unfortunately, they aren't.  The Smashing Pumpkins NEVER fail to enlighten me with their beautiful lyrics, unique music and Corgan's voice is one of the most recognizable voices in music history.  The first song, Mellon Collie &amp; The Infinite Sadness is instrumental but one of the most beautiful, well put piano playing songs I've EVER heard.  Tonight, Tonight takes you on a journey just like the video, Jellybelly is a louder song - in the perfect place for Zero follows, another rock song.  Here Is No Why is in my opinion, perfection.  Nothing could make this song better because it's just perfect.  Bullet With Butterfly Wings is an angry song, I like the lyrics and the vocals fit perfectly for the song and its meaning.  To Forgive is extremely slow, it's actually my favourite song off the CD.  An Ode to No One, Love and Cupid de Locke are no exception when I say this album has amazing rock songs.  Galapogos, in my opinion, is a little more popish but doesn't fail to live up to the others, amazing.  Muzzle, Porcelina of the Vast Oceans and Take Me Down are also amazing making Dawn To Dusk one of the best albums ever made.<BR>For Disc. 2, Where Boys Fear to Tread is the first song, a great opener.  I'm going to say the same thing for every song, just pure brilliance.  With lyrics such as &quot;I need someone to ease my mind but sometimes a someone is so hard to find&quot; and &quot;despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage&quot;, it just proves that Corgan is one of the best song writers of the decade.  I can't imagine my life without this CD set.<BR>I was actually very young when I got this CD and I think this is actually one of those CDs that MAKES you.  One of the ones you grow up to then you have so much respect for it.  I recommend it to everyone and anyone, actually if I had all the money in the world I'd buy this CD for everyone.  One listen and that's enough, it's amazing.  Brilliant, intelligent, raw, fresh - bottom line:  GET THIS ALBUM if you don't already.
B00005V0X5|5.0|Its a thrash classic, what more should I say?
B0000VCZK2|5.0|The Alien Quadrilogy consists of 9 DVD's and contains TWO VERSIONS of each movie (Theatrical release and Special Edition which adds in all additional/deleted/extended scenes).  The extra DVD's of each movie consist of a lot of production and post-production features.  The ninth DVD givs you a variety of special features (I still need to take a look at those).  I haven't watched the rest yet, but the [Special Edition] of Alien3, made me able to give that movie a \\"thumbs up!\\"...unlike before, where I had to give Alien3 a \\"thumbs way down!\\".  The extra scenes and extended takes give the movie more of a \\"meaning\\" in the whole dark plot in the Fury 161 High-Security Prison.  I will not say anymore.  I recently read another review where the person had to return it twice for bad DVD's and scratched discs.  If you ordered those off the internet and had them delivered to you, I would say that was a bad idea, to me anyways.  I never trust the delivery guys for they take bad care of the packages once the get them.  I strictly do IN-STORE pick-ups unless I have no other choice or the particular item I am looking for is completely unavailable in the retail store.  Getting back to the Alien Quadrilogy, this is one of the greatest collections I have ever owned after the James Bond Collection ^_^<br />----------<br />Alien --> ***1/2 stars<br />Aliens --> **** stars<br />Alien3 --> *1/2 stars<br />Alien Resurrection --> **1/2 stars<br />----------<br />Alien [Director's Cut] --> **** stars<br />Aliens [Special Edition] --> **** stars<br />Alien3 [Special Edition] --> **1/2 stars  &lt;-- was still having a hard time deciding that one, even though, the Special Edition was good<br />Alien Resurrection [Special Edition] --> *** stars<br />----------<br />That's my review, thanks
0780020685|1.0|I guess I should preface this by saying that I'm really not an Asian-movie person.  I just don't &quot;get&quot; them, and I'm sure it's a cultural thing. &quot;Tampopo,&quot; &quot;Crouching Tiger,&quot; &quot;In the Realm of the Senses&quot; and now this one -- I couldn't sit through any of them.  Unless you are a martial arts or samurai fanatic, or a big lover of Japanese culture and history, I would say definitely skip this -- especially if you are female.  I think this is one of those &quot;Emperor's New Movies&quot; that we're all supposed to like, and no one will admit to NOT liking it for fear of being thought ignorant!
B00009ATKS|5.0|Note well:  Weird thing about these amazon reviews:  you only get a slight notion of any given reviewer's taste:  so here is a little background concerning mine:  my favorite bands are The Beatles, The Cure, The Black Watch, XTC and My Bloody Valentine:  I dislike stuff like Coldplay, Radiohead, Travis...all that wispy nonsense...I like brilliantly witty, well constructed songs...and I admire great lyricists...and that's why it's so odd and amazing that I am completely in love with (and a serious completist about) the Scottish band Mogwai.  Every record they have done is consistently interesting and the &quot;Happy&quot; new one is no exception.  These mostly instrumental tracks are definitely for those of you who have never dreamed of getting into intrumental bands.  There's almost--without sounding too trippy--a vocalist, as it were, present in a ghostly way here.  If you have good taste, you will never even consider selling Mogwai's stuff back--cause their records never get old.  They are one of the most consistent bands ever--the pink floyd of the 00's...buy anything by them!!!
0385504209|1.0|I have come to love this book. Dan Brown is a novelist of quite extraordinary genius in that while he is very possibly the worst writer of fiction I have ever read, he has produced a work of such hilarity that I could hardly bear to put the book down! Cardboard (well, flimsier than that) characters including the interesting man with the Mickey Mouse watch, the clever French girl, the amazing not-quite-dead-yet museum curator, the crippled English maniac (YAWN! find someone else to do villains America), blindingly obvious plot turns, the lack of any real twist, codes a retarded three year old could solve - and he teaches writers??  Just brilliant... as for his woeful knowledge of Europe - The Aristocats was a more realistic portrayal of Paris! All these massive holes in plot, character, realism are, however, mere quibbles. I cannot think of another writer who has stirred up so much controversy - just look at the number of reviews - from so little. Buy this book and laugh yerself silly. As for me I'm going to read everything he's done. I deserve to be punished.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|No written review can do this show justice, I recommend watching this show to truly appricate it...<br />One of FOX's biggest mistakes was showing the episodes out of order, which directly contributed to the cancelation of the show.
0385504209|1.0|I have to admit I'm biased, Umberto Eco being one of my favorite living authors, but The Da Vinci Code is just a pale imitation of Eco's sublime and meticulous work. The prose is excruciating the plot transparent and the characters are pure cliches. The random historical facts Brown throws in come across as smug and extraneous; he reminds me of that one kid in every class who  thinks his constant off-topic comments impress the professor. Please please turn back now and buy Foucault's Pendulum instead.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|this straining display of limp pathos should appeal to fans of James Fey's, &quot;A Million, Tiny, Overwraught, Ill-Contrived, Rich-Boy Pieces of Dung,&quot; which recently topped out at #1 on the Amazon editors picks for best of 2003. No wonder we're in Iraq- my country is populated by easily led fools: &quot;Oohhhh! those long shots of faces looking out windows- they were just drenched with inner longing and tendentious malaise, indicative of the character's live, *sigh,* I can't wait for the sequel when he goes back and hugs her again.&quot;<br />whatever... if you think this drivel is 'arty' or 'deep' because it is merely ambiguously insinuative... Do yourself a favor and stay away from Florence, Italy. You won't get it.
1400034779|2.0|While the characters are mildly engaging, the plotlines in this book are rather uninteresting.  I found the solutions to the mysteries glaringly obvious, and I am not one of those people who can routinely figure out whodunit by page 15.  Precious Ramotswe is a likable but bungling detective who repeatedly gets found out by the people she is supposed to be trailing (yes, I know it's part of the plot, but it's rather irritating).  The novel is just barely worth reading for the pleasant local color, but as far as intelligent mystery fiction goes, I would rather reread any Dorothy Sayers novel--except the execrable _Thrones, Dominations_, completed posthumously by another author--for the umpteenth time, than continue following Mma Ramotswe's career.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|With today's lack of quality television, and along with the devestating cancellation of Firefly I have lost all hope for television media and stopped watching all together. The disgusting thing is that while good shows like Friefly and Family Guy are being cancelled by FOX (The great, evil opressor of quality) moronic TV shows like &quot;my big fat fiancee&quot; and &quot;american idol&quot; are being aired instead. Excuse me while I vomit... Reality TV makes me sick.<br />The thing we can all hope for is that DVD sales continue as they have. Then abe we'll get our well-deserved movie. If the motion picture hit's the silverscreen, someone might just walk up to Joss and say, quote &quot;Why don't we make a sereis out of this?&quot;.<br />For now we have to wait patiently as Joss tries to get the movie through the various obstacles facing him. What we really need is to promote the sereis using &quot;Gureilla tactics&quot; (see fireflymovie.com) and something that would help out really is if by a miracle it re-aired on sci-fi or another channel (maybe UPN?).<br />I know this isn't a review of the disk set. I simply don't have words for how good this show was and how it affected me. I just hope you all &quot;keep flying&quot; and aybe the series will get off the ground again.<br />Thank you, Joss
B00005JL78|3.0|The movie version of Minority Report starred Tom Cruise and came out in 2002. There are many changes here vs the original story. The most obvious one is that they COMPLETELY removed the entire main premise of the story, that there are changes to the time continuum based on Anderton learning of what is going to happen. Instead, they turn the story around so there is actually NO minority report - that all 3 versions of Anderton's future are the same, having him kill Leopold. The new premise of the movie is that the future is *uncertain* - where the book had the precogs seeing the reality of a set future.<br />In the movie, Anderton isn't an older, almost obsolete cop. He's a young, slick hotshot. Witwer isn't a newcomer looking to horn in on Anderton's turf. Witwer is an 'oversight' individual coming to judge the system. So the entire main emotion path of Anderton 'becoming obsolete' vs the army 'becoming obsolete' is completely gone.<br />Anderton is set up to commit a murder by his boss. He has 72 hours to figure out why he would murder this stranger and evades his own friends to do so. Security is run on eyeball recognition so he has his eyeballs yanked out and puts in new ones. He grabs the minority reporter and escapes with her to find out what she saw, thinking this will clear him of the murder charge. But actually she saw the same thing the others did - there IS no minority report. While he has her, though, he learns that her mother was killed in a devious way by Anderton's boss. The boss wanted to prevent the mother from taking the precog back and ruining the precrime setup. Anderton exercises free will and doesn't kill the guy he was supposed to, even though things are very plainly set up to say that this guy was responsible for kidnapping Anderton's son.<br />Then it's a race to have Anderton prove that his boss was responsible for the murder of the mom and for getting away with it by manipulating the precog's vision of it. At the end, they let out of jail every person ever accused of a precrime, since they feel that free will MIGHT have had some of those people change their mind at the last moment.<br />My Notes -<br />This was a great action-thriller and since Anderton is a police commissioner, he does indeed have the 'spy-like' qualities that Tom Cruise shows. His character isn't a scientist or 'everydayman' like some of the other Philip K Dick stories. So the entire movie was made into an action-thriller featuring that main character, but they *bastardized* the entire story to get to that point. Where Imposter was a great version of the original story and people didn't like it, Minority Report was an AWFUL version of the original story and people loved it.<br />First off, Anderton was supposed to be an aging, balding, &quot;obsolete&quot; character. That was part of the main motivation here, his feeling of obsolescence and the army's feeling of obsolescence. All of that is gone. Instead, Anderton is a young, slick druggie who pines for his lost son (an invention). The precogs are sexy, naked adults instead of 'retarded' kid-like monstrosities.<br />The whole point of the original story was that knowledge of a future has the potential to allow you *change* that future which is equally recorded by a precog. The precogs were NOT wrong. They were each accurately recording their version of the future. The end of the story has the precrime system still in place. In comparison, the whole point of the movie was that the precogs COULD be wrong and people had free will. Humans COULD do things other than what the future did hold. And the end result is that the system collapses.<br />Not only that, but the movie has huge plot holes as a result of this wild change to the storyline. First off, Leopold is set up to appear to be the child molestor by Anderton's boss. Why? If the system is working perfectly, and it's about to go nation-wide, why would the boss want to put anything in to risk it? Nobody is going to realize he killedthe mom, that's ancient news. Next, Anderton gets all these clues about a minority report, and the girl's testimony on his case is missing. But why? She did NOT have a minority report. She saw the same things the others saw! So it should have been on the tape, he should never have stolen her away and therefore never learned that the girl had other minority reports in her past.<br />I especially didn't like the scene in Anderton's house where the precog goes on a long monologue about what Anderton's son would have been like growing up, had he not been abducted and killed by a child molestor. Just what was the point of that? Is the precog now an Ouija board too, communicating with the dead? The whole anguish over the dead son was not in the original story and added to the emotion level, but again detracted from the actual sequence of events and meaning behind them.<br />It was a Happy Ending that Anderton and his wife end up together again, with her pregnant again. But the whole Hollywood Happy Ending with that and the system being shut down is the complete opposite of what the story was trying to tell us - and the fact that Hollywood says &quot;free will triumphs!&quot; also misses the point.<br />It's like making the movie version of Star Wars and having the Empire win in the end. Either you do a movie form of the book, or you do a movie without any reference to the book. But why claim it's based on the book when the entire plot is the opposite of what the book said? And why lose the entire plot twist and base plot line that made the story so fascinating? Did they think the movie watching audience was too dumb to understand how timelines would affect each other?<br />I loved the movie *as a story*.

B0000073BG|5.0|This album is Renaissance's Abbey Road.  The Scheherazade song cycle stands as a tribute to progressive rock's synthesis of rock and classical elements.  The \\"flip side,\\" while not held together by a common thread, still has lovely elements (though, just like Abbey Road, one could question at least one of the individual selections).  Scheherazade enchants, enthralls and captivates the imagination -- and does so with an economy of words.  Just beautiful and well produced with so much detail and layers of sound.  Pretentious?  Not by a long-shot.  After listening, I feel as though I'm traveling back into time, wandering into a more innocent musical place;  I'm younger again.

I have seen all the live Elvis movies and nothing can compare to this one. This DVD is Restored, remixed, it focuses on a new look at Elvis Presley. The sound is out of this world its way better than the orginal the cameras keep rolling their is not a missed piece of footage. This is a must have for an Elvis Presley fan I enjoyed this and so will you so what are you waiting for go buy this!!!!!
B0000399WI|5.0|When someone suggested this movie to me I wasn't really interested because I didn't think I would like it but one day I was flipping channels and it was on a cable movie channel and it had just started so I decided to watch it for the hell of it.  I figured it can't be all bad if it has Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman in it.  I have to tell you I was blown away!  It was so good and completely captivating.  I really felt for Tim Robbins character.  Another pleasant surprise, at least to me, is that the marvelous Clancy Brown plays one of the prison guards.  Some of you may remember his great performance as The Kurgan in The Highlander.<BR>Morgan Freeman is superb, as always, as Andy's best friend.  I can't tell what happens because it will spoil it for you, but if you like a story well told and to be caught by surprise by something you didn't think you would, like then watch this movie!<BR>Trust me you won't regret it.

Seeing ugly duckling Fran blossom into the kind of person her mother would be proud of, watching Scott be true to his need to dance his own steps is truly exhilarating. And the music? Stays with you well after the movie. Even as I type, &quot;Perhaps&quot; and &quot;Rhumba De Burros&quot; are fluttering thru my head.<br />It is a &quot;feel good movie&quot; without being cliche. It is a love story without all the sap.
B00011RPB0|3.0|If writer/director Sofia Coppola had in mind to arrest a moment in the lives of two disparate people trapped in the ennui of isolation in a city whose language and life style is in every sense foreign, then LOST IN TRANSLATION  is a success.  After all the hype from the Golden Globes awards, the media, the endless ads, this small film promised to be revelatory. But at least for this viewer it seems a one-note song that wears thin after about 30 minutes.  One aspect that may be considered comedic in nature is the seeming put-down of the Japanese people encountered by our couple (Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray.  To these eyes and ears this mimicking of English pronunciation and the concept that nearly all Japanese people are ignorant of English in the hotels and the media creates an insulting view.  As for the performances Murray and Johansson make the best of what little they have to work with and FINALLY in the last 20 minutes we begin to care about them as people.  Not a bad movie, just one that has been over-rated.  Do yourself a favor when viewing this DVD: turn the volume down to escape the deafening music and the bad Karaoke!
0380977788|4.0|This is the third Neil Gaiman novel I have had the pleasure of reading.  I bought it for my 6th grader and read it to make sure it was \\"appropriate\\".  I find that for the most part it is, but it has its disturbing moments.  The illustrations in the novel definitely add to the unnerving nature of the book. The character of the other mother is not fully developed, but is a villain you can still root against.  Coraline is a fine, strong character.  The novel is also filled with trademark Gaiman off kilter humor.  I found it very enjoyable and would recommend it to most anyone.<br />T
B000002BPS|4.0|This is a great Offspring album.  It is most definitely a worthy follow up to Smash.  It is not as punk sounding as their earlier efforts.  I'd say this is more of a rock or hard rock album.  Ranks up in the top 3 of all their albums.  The standout tracks on the this album are pretty much all of them.  What's great about the last one, Change the world, is that it opens with the riff that ended Smash.  Listening to a song like Cool to Hate and I Choose give you a hint of what Americana was going to sound like.  If you like the Offspring chances are you will definitely like this one.  Go out and buy it.  I don't think you will be too disappointed.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Quentin Tarantino is, without a doubt, one of the most skilled and enigmatic movie directors of our time. He has this maddening habit of making us wait a ridiculous amount of time between his films (a trait shared with kindred spirit Stanley Kubrick) and then astounding us with the product he gives us when he finally does create one. Even his less than stellar films such as 'Jackie Brown' still have style and flair that almost make the wait seem worthwhile. Following 'Jackie Brown', Tarantino felt the need to make fans wait six (!) years before his next film. In addition, he felt that need to split that film into two volumes in a move that smacked of poor editing and self-serving box office grabbery. Fortunately, the long wait and split film proved appropriate when one views with wonder the fruit that is, 'Kill Bill: Volume 1'. <br />Given Tarantino's undeniable skill behind the camera and intimate knowledge of action and film noir, it was only a matter of time before he tackled the genre of Hong Kong martial arts films. 'Kill Bill: Volume 1' shows that Tarantino has an implicit understanding of the elements that allowed that genre to appeal to so many. While it is undoubtedly one of the most violent films ever committed to celluloid, the violence is almost comical in its use of ancient special effects techniques. It also seems to quite fitting given the nature of the story. The story focuses on the quest for revenge by an underworld figure known as the Black Mumba (Uma Thurman) against her former colleagues, the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (or DiVAS), and their mastermind Bill (David Carradine) for their attempt to kill her, her unborn child, and her betrothed on Mumba's wedding day. They failed (barely) and now the Black Mumba is back to exact revenge against those who tried to take her life. <br />'Kill Bill: Volume 1' is unique in the sense that it tells a compelling story without really having much of a plot. The film is straightforward in the sense that it deals solely with Mumba's revenge, but it is not straightforward in how that tale is told. Little hints at the very beginning show the audience that this film follows the same non-linear episodic structure that most of Taratino's films follow. As Mumba (who is only once referred to by name in this film) prepares to confront one of her targets, one Ms. Vernita Green aka 'Copperhead' (Vivica A. Fox), she reviews the target's name on her checklist. One can see that the name O-ren Ishii aka 'Cottonmouth' (Lucy Liu) has already been crossed out, but we have not yet seen that battle. In the between the actual fight scenes, Tarantino has inserted little snippets of anecdotes that tell the tale of the characters who perform in this play. We get pieces of Mumba's back-story and a brief snippet of Green's. One of the truly remarkable departures of the action scenes is Tarantino's anime related telling of story of O-Ren Ishii. To tell her story in anime is both inspired and practical. Use of anime seems like a perfect compliment in a martial arts movie and the story of O-ren Ishii is so explicitly physically and sexually violent that to tell it in live action would surely have garnered 'Kill Bill'' a dreaded NC-17 rating.<br />The fight scenes in 'Kill Bill: Volume 1' have been expertly choreographed and executed. One would be hard pressed to find a contemporary film that could make such graphic violence seem like ballet, but 'Kill Bill'' manages it. The scenes where Black Mumba fights O-ren Ishii and her 'Crazy 88s' assassination squadron are the most expertly done and stimulating to watch. For extra flair, Tarantino has included Hong Kong legend, Sonny Chiba, in a role as Mumba's mentor, Hattori Hanzo. The other, smaller characters also serve to enrich the overall scope of the film and provide suggestions at what has passed and hints at what is to come. While initially seeming like a poorly conceived ploy, the division of this 'Kill Bill' into volumes 1 and 2 seems whollyrelevant after watching the first installment. There is a naturally break in the story as Mumba rests for her assault on her remaining targets (Bill, included) and it ends with as fantastic a cliff hanger as there has been in more than two decades of film. To put these two installments together into one might have watered-down its impact. Now, audiences will be left to wait a few months for the next installment to satisfy their hunger for the rest of this story. Few films carry that kind of power anymore. 'Kill Bill: Volume 1' is a film that does.
B00000DHRZ|4.0|Many people say this album is proof that they sold out.  Whatever.  These same people would have complained it Americana sounded exactly like Smash.  These so called music elitists would complain that they never changed and were one hit wonders.  So it may be pop sounding, they got a good producer because they could afford it.  It's a great album with many songs that you'll find yourself singing along to.<br />Have you ever: 10/10  I love this song.  It is an amazing song and like i have said before, is a great way to start off the CD.  It has the energy to keep you rocking and the lyrics to keep you singing along.<br />Staring at the Sun: 9/10  Typical punk rock you'd expect from the offspring.  Its just a little more produced.  Overall a good song.  Check out their website to see what the lyrics are about.  I'll bet you will be surprised.<br />Pretty Fly: 10/10 So it sounds poppy.  Who cares.  It is catchy and will easily get stuck in your head.  Just like most of their singles.  What i liked about this one is that the people it poked fun at bought this album in droves<br />The Kids aren't alright: 6/10  The only reason this gets a low rating is because it has been overplayed.  I originally really liked this song.  Has a bit of a hard rock/80's sound to it.  The lyrics are about the realities of growing up in most neighborhoods.<br />Feelings: 2/10  A poor cover of a stupid song<br />She's got issues: 7/10  It's not a bad song.  Noting more than a rock song with some funny lyrics.  <br />Walla Walla: 9/10  How ironic that this is playing on my playlist right now.  I like this song alot.  It's a fast paced punk song that also has good energy.  <br />End of the LIne: 10/10  This is probably my favorite punk song on the album.  I can't explain why.  Whenver i hear it i always get into this song.<br />No Brakes: 9/10  When i first heard this song it reminded me of some of their earlier stuff.  It was short and to the point with a great riff.  I could see this one being on Smash, maybe a b-side from those sessions.<br />Why don't you get a job: 6/10 This is a decent slower song.  The second big hit off the album.  It always reminds me of the Beatles Obladi song.  I think that SPare me the details is a much better song in this vein.<br />Americana: 10/10  This is another track that i really like.  Yet again i always find myself getting into whenever i hear it.  The lyrics are great on this one.  It pokes fun at suburban America.<br />Pay the Man: 10/10 I really like this one.  It is quite long and different for them.  The song starts out slow with a long instrumental.  About halfway through it picks up and gets pretty fast.  I think that is my favorite part about it.  You are getting into the slower part and then it changes tempo and ends on a high note.<br />Overall this is a pretty solid effort for them.  Well worth getting if you like The Offspring.
0142000663|5.0|I read this book when I was 12 and I loved it!  It's interesting to see how the people of the Great Depresion lived through things.  John Steinbeck is a great author and I think he deserved the nobel prize.  After reading this book of his, I'm also going to read 'Of Mice and Men' and 'East of Eden'.  I'm sure they'll be as wonderful as 'The Grapes of Wrath'.  This is probably my favorite Pulitzer, read it!!!!
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|I dont really want to post a review but more of a complaint on when people compare perfect circle to tool saying things like the band would be better with so and so or if they had the sound of tool... I dont know if those that have mentioned these things noticed that thay are 2 different bands, a perfect circle and Tool, so to compare them or say they should sound like tool is very dumb.<br />ronniejamesdio_holydiver@yahoo.com
B000002UJQ|1.0|Like every wannabe hip student, I loved this album back in 1997.<BR>Slow depressing electronic pop and coooool artwork were the key to radiohead success on the campus.<BR>Since then, you have seen and heard them everywhere and many british bands have followed in their trail: muse and placebo being the most annoying of the bunch.<BR>Now I am sick of all the guys who say this is the best album of all times.<BR>Open up ! listen to some jazz, hip hop, classical music... and don't forget that less is more.
0380002930|1.0|I really did not enjoy Watership Down. As a student in juinor high school it was very boring to read. I did not want to read a book about rabbits and their problems. The book did not match my interests, so it made me dislike it even more. If i didnt have to do a project on it, i would not have finished reading the book.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|This was a very neat movie dealing with isolation, misery and the need for connection.  It's about 3 people who are in a bind, stuck in isolation, not really knowing how to deal with it or how to change it---plus they are surrounded by folks that either don't see them, or are well meaning, but cannot connect with them to help them.  The three people are Will (Grant), Marcus the boy, and his mother, Fiona (Collette).  <br />    Will technically should be in Nirvana, he is wealthy, doesn't work, is attractive enough to nail a different gal every night, yet really isn't doing much with his life--no passions like travel, golf, friends, etc.  His idea of Christmas is watching videos and getting drunk at home, alone.  His domineering Stephord-Wife sister & dope husband constantly has humiliating \\"interventions\\" with him, even in public, trying to fix his \\"loser-ness\\".  They want him to live just like they do, with the house, baby and spoiled uncontrolleable-animal toddler that hits folks in the sack, goo on the upholstery--not appealing.<br />    For all that he feels \\"OK\\", he keeps searching for the next woman---as opposed to hiring an escort service which would be more logical for what he claims to \\"want\\" in a woman.  He's even started an elaborate scheme to meet single mothers, thinking  low-risk target.  (Still not an escort service, so I think he does hope ultimately for connection.)  He is very aware that his lifestyle is a turnoff to most women who have interests & passions.  He never keeps anybody around long enough to get close and risk more pain.  Basically, he's not really living what could be a really cool life.<br />    Fiona is a new-age hippy vegetarian music-therapist, and is raising her boy, Marcus, that way.  For all her career and success at living the completely hippy, vegetarian lifestyle, you would think she would be in bliss too, but she too is desperately sad and alone, without many friends.  She is very controlling over her boy, and he has no wayto rebel against her controlling, politically-correct dominations.<br />   Marcus, who has only his mother's viewpoints, none of his own in the beginning, is a very nerdy, granola boy.  His mother screeches \\"I love you's\\" at his school playground, making him giant Bulleye.  He's completely dressed the opposite of all the other kids, plus he retreats from reality quite often, going into fantasyland and singing at the worst times.  He's watching his mother slide down the depression slope, and after her attempt at suicide, he decides to bring in extra help--unsuspecting Will.<br />   Will accidentally met Marcus while trying to score on one single mother.  Marcus sized him up and decided he was a good material for helping his mother.  Unfortunately, Will wasn't interested.  But, Marcus craves friendship, since he had none, and his mother is a basketcase.  So, the adventure begins with Marcus pursuing the unwilling Will.  You can see though, that Will is growing to really depend on the human contact.  <br />    I do think they are about the same age, although not sure what age that is.  The boy has been parenting his mother, watching her depression progress, trying to fix it.  Will runs away from any human emotions...   (Although Will finds babies and toddlers unappealing, I don't at all think this point makes him immature.  That idea comes from \\"obsessed-with-children\\"-types that bully you to worship their demon-children, or get labeled awful things.)<br />    Anyway, you see the change these folks bring about in each other.  Maybe they each provide a safe place to bring about change.  Marcus finally has a place and a friend to talk about his things without anybody trying to control his thoughts.  Mom finally gets some realistic feedback on her parenting and mental health, plus somebody caring about her that knows the truth.  Will finally has a safe, land-mine free place to experiment with feelings, a buddy to pal around with, and grows some bravery.<br />Other good films to watch with:  \\"Whale Rider\\", \\"High Fidelity\\" are other good personal growth films.
B00004YX0R|5.0|I'm normally a period-instrument listener, almost to the exclusion of everything else.  There is no complete cycle of Beethoven's string quartets on period instruments, so I hunted around for a good modern instrument set, and was directed to this one.  I am thrilled with the result.  The Quatuor Talich give a magnificent reading of this music, allowing the graces and nuances of Beethoven's sometimes fiendishly difficult music to shine through.<br />Two words of criticism--the cover for the box set has got to be THE WORST classical album cover I have ever seen--godawful Blake-meets-Stanley Kubrick garbage that belongs on an album of bad early-80s synthesiser music.  AND--Amazon customers, be warned: I picked up this set at a local record store for $39.98 CANADIAN--that's $29.98 in the US at current coversion rates.  Why is Amazon stiffing its customers by charging $55.00 US?  This is supposed to be a bargain-basement set (as the bargain-basement cover will tell you).  Please, Amazon, reprice this fine set now!
B00005221L|5.0|1987's PREDATOR is an entertaining and suspenseful hybrid of the sci-fi, horror, and action genres that came out a few years after his phenomenal success with his roles in THE TERMINATOR and the CONAN THE BARBARIAN movies, and muscleman Arnold Schwarzenegger demonstrates here that the range of his acting skills continues to expand.  He delivers a strong performance as Major &quot;Dutch&quot; Schaeffer, the leader of a crack U.S. commando squad sent to Central America to rescue some downed airmen that have purportedly been kidnapped by terrorists.  When the mission goes awry, Dutch and crew are forced to traverse a dangerous jungle in order to reach the pre-arranged rendezvous with their OWN rescuers.  And that jungle turns out to be even more dangerous than first imagined, as the squad members soon find themselves in the midst of a safari being conducted by an intelligent extraterrestrial--and THEY are the objects of the hunt!<br />Schwarzenegger is backed by a group of outstanding supporting actors that includes Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, Jesse Ventura (yes, that's Governor Ventura), and Sonny Landham.  Considering the film's production date, the breathtaking special FX are very original and innovative, and Stan Winston's design and FX for the alien are so totally cool that the creature remains a popular SF icon today.<br />The DVD from Fox is short on extras, offering the trailer only, but the widescreen digital transfer is beautifully stunning and the Dolby Digital sound is fantastic.<br />In short, this is one of Arnie's best, especially from his earlier body of work, and the quality DVD is offered at a price that is reasonable enough that any SF or action-flick fan can add it to their collection.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|As far as extras go, this DVD really does not have a whole lot, which is why I only gave it 4 stars. On the merits of the movie itself, I would give it 5. <br />Kate Beckinsale plays Selene, a Vampire Death Dealer who has the job of hunting down Lycans (Werewolves) and killing them. Apparently there has been a war between the Vampires and Lycans going on for a really long time. At the beginning of the film she learns that the lycans are interested in a certain human, so the rest of the story revolves around her figuring out why the human is so important. There are many twists as you find out that some good guys are actually bad and vice versa....some which I didn't even see comming.<br />There are some MAJOR loose ends that are left at the end of the movie, partly because I think they were planning on making another one at some point. This movie can stand by itself, don't get me wrong, but it never says what happens to a few key characters at the end. <br />The characters of the movie made it though. I really like Selene, partly because she was a woman and could kick ass (girl power!). Michael, the human, was interesting. At first I was a little annoyed with his laid-back-deer-in-headlights act, but he got more agressive later on. Plus, yeah, he was a little attractive. What can I say! Lucian, the head Lycan, was my favorite, and when you watch the movie you will see why. If I said anything else about him, I would be giving up too much story. He was just cool! <br />The style and feel of the movie is much like the Crow and the Matrix (a few of the fight scenes), like other reviewers have mentioned. The city is dark and dirty, and always seems to be bathed in blue light. It rains alot and everyone, even humans, always seem to be wearing black. But this also gives the movie an Any-big-city feel. I had the feeling it was in the USA, but it could just as easily have been across the ocean.  <br />So, as far as style, the movie has great mood.<BR>As far as plot, not the most original, but still pretty creative. Its hard to come up with something completly new.<BR>And the Actors - I believe they were well chosen and did a good job. Not really BIG name actors, so you could look at them and see their characters, and not *who* they are in real life.<br />If you are still unsure, rent the movie, but more than likely you will end up buying it sooner or later.
B00003CXE7|5.0|In this movie Russell crow plays a great roll and he is great at it too. He is in the roman army until the emperor of roam gets murdered by his own son and blames it on Maximus Decimus Meridius(Russell Crow). So Maximus flees to go home knowing that the roman empire would strike there first. When he arrives at his long driveway he sees smoke in the air. He walks up the driveway to find his wife and son burnt to death while being hanged. He breaks down and goes on journey for revenge. He goes through the desert and gets hurt bad and collapses he is soon picked up by a slave wagon and thus the gladiator. I thought this movie should get two thumbs up. I thought it was a marvelous story and adventure about ancient Rome. I was a little long but it had something for every second of it. the movie was criticly acclaimed and nomiated for may acadamy awards such as best actor in leading role and won and best picture and won. i saw the movie at the theaiter and bought it the day it came out. it will make you cry laugh joyful and happy. it will leave you on the edege of your seat the whole time.

B00008GKEG|5.0|As a Beatles fan who wasn't born until 1980, this is about as close as I can get to seeing the Beatles live.  It's not only a great documentary with lots of rare footage of the boys, but its damn funny too.  George (when he can remember them) and Paul often have very different versions of stories, and Ringo seems so genuinely nice and like he really enjoyed his ride as a Beatle, possibly more than the other guys.  I gave it five stars - how can you not after watching ten hours and enjoying every second?  However, I do have a serious problem with the re-editing that went on from the TV airing to the DVD.  My friend and I noticed several differences - mostly scenes featuring the three &quot;present day&quot; Beatles being left off the DVD.  Why do this when they added so much additional footage for the DVD? I know hardly anyone else will be bugged by this, but they happened to be funny scenes, which is why we remembered them from watching the anthology on television.  Anyway, despite the strange cuts, every Beatle fan should buy this collection.
0312995423|5.0|This book consumed the life of myself and my husband for an entire weekend. Things like cleaning the house and going to the grocery store were put on hold! This was one of the best books I've ever read - read it and then recommend it to everyone you've ever met!
B00005R1N3|5.0|Olivia Hussey is Jess and Margot \\"Sisters / Superman\\" Kidder is the drunken, joyfully cynical Barb in this yuletide chiller. A creepy pervert keeps calling their sorority house, making threats and odd noises. The house is getting ready to empty out for the holidays with a big christmas bash. The phone-freak calls again, right after we see a man climb a trellis and slip into an attic window. Barb yells at him and says some choice words of her own. This offends one of the other girls present, who goes upstairs to pack. She is met with sudden death at the hands of the unknown psycho, who now has the run of the house! Bob Clark (Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things) has directed a tense, terrifying, should-be classic here! Keir Delea (2001: A Space Odyssey / Bunny Lake Is Missing) is excellent as the driven, possibly unbalanced boyfriend of Jess. They've just had a big fight over her desire to get an abortion. Has this got anything to do with the horrors that await our sorority sisters, or just another red herring? Margot Kidder steals every scene she's in. She's tough, obnoxious, and unafraid of anything. Barb, Jess, and Phyl (Andrea Martin) end up as the only ones staying in the house for christmas. Their house-mother has suffered an untimely demise in the attic. Of course, the girls just think she went home. John Saxon (A Nightmare On Elm Street) is a police detective investigating a local 13yo girl's abduction / murder, who is drawn into the unfolding mystery on sorority row. Was the little girl another victim of the attic man? Many things are left unresolved and irritatingly unexplained, like in real life. There's a haunting, building dread in BLACK CHRISTMAS that gets into your bloodstream. I wanted to see it again immediately after watching it! If horror is your bag, check this one out...
019431510X|4.0|Just a few points:<br />This dictionary is intuitive, informative and aesthetically appealing.<br />Not only are the lexical entries themselves of a praiseworthy degree of clarity, the grammatical tables, diagrams and explanations to the front and back of the book are well placed and a ready reference.<br />I have used it for some years now and it has certainly grown on me.<br />My only reservations about this dictionary are:<br />1) It is weak on archaic words, the usage for which I use dictionaries most of all.  For this, I supplement my dictionary needs with the much older &quot;New Standard Illustrated Dictionary and Encyclopædia (Williams, A.M, ed, Odhams Press, undated (!)).<br />2) The phonetic symbols at the front are handy, but not always used, even in other Oxford dictionaries.  However, it is naturally important that the phonetic symbols themselves are retained.  This isn't actually a criticism of the dictionary itself, but rather a plea for inter-publishing house consistency.<br />3) In the preface, the term 'polysemous' is used.  This word is not found in the dictionary itself!<br />Despite these minor reservations, this dictionary is recommended, especially if you are coming to English as a second language (which isn't the case for myself).  It has been well worth the money.
B00000DR8R|5.0|When &quot;Rattlesnakes&quot; was first released in 1984, just about every music critic around called Lloyd Cole &quot;The Next Bob Dylan.&quot; Sadly, Lloyd Cole couldn't match Dylan's longevity. Still, he flirts with perfection on &quot;Rattlesnakes.&quot; <br />The images are amazing: &quot;She has cheekbones like geometry and eyes like sin,&quot; or the perfect simile: &quot;She looks like Eva Marie-Saint in `On the Waterfront.'&quot; Anyone who's seen that film knows how angelic a vision that was. <br />Some of the songs show Cole's dark sense of fun, sort of like his friend/competitor, Morissey.  Still, when the final strains of &quot;Are You Ready to Be Heartbroken&quot; fade slowly away, you can't help but remember every ex- you've ever had, and wonder why you were ever surprised that relationships end badly.  <br />Lloyd Cole showed some flashes of brilliance on his next two albums with the Commotions--especially on &quot;Mainstream&quot;--but he could never top &quot;Rattlesnakes.&quot;  Hey, who could?
B00003CXAR|5.0|It's the best movie in history.  <BR>Plot: Cheif Brody, a lazy cop who expects no shooting no nothing at all, who's afraid of the water, comes to face a killer shark after it already killed a girl, devoured a boy, tried to oblitcherate a man, and tore off some guy's head.  Cheif Brody calls in Matt Hooper, a sensational character, to help him out.  He can't do anything about it but they call in Quint, who's already volunteered to hunt the shark.  Together, they travel across the waters of Amity to hunt down the shark and kill it once and for all.<br />DVD: As anyone knows, they really screwed up with the bons features.  (Sign a petition for a better one at the Jaws wbsite.)<BR>You get trailers, the making of the film, storyboards and so on.  <br />Quality: Overall, they should've done better on the bonus features, but who cares because this movie is a classic will reamin a callic and will always be a classic.  <BR>It's the greatest movie ever.  <br />Characters: The Characters are great, Hoopers awesome!  Quint is the best actor I've ever seen in a movie and Brody was sensational.  <br />My recomendations: Tremors, Tremors 2 aftershock, Jaws 2, Jurassic Park, the lost world, The Patriot,  and many more that would take to long to list.<br />Overall: Overall the movie is great, the bonus features are mediokre.  Buy don't rent.  You'll never regret it.  <BR>----Ben Grabski ...
0380789019|5.0|this book really made me think outside of myself and the well-trodden path.  it's very seductive, in that's the characters are so real &amp; their journey is so vivid, every time I read it I get pulled back into that world, underworld, overworld, around-us world.
6303073107|1.0|I'm afraid I'll get a lot of heat from this, but if you liked this movie, you've lost your mind. I'm afraid all too often people are influenced by critics and intimidated by old black and white films with subtitles. Though it may be a ground-breaking style of film, that does not make it a good film. In a sad attempt to confuse the truth about the death of a man, Kurosawa frustrates audiences with a bad Twilight Zone episode; too long and without that creepy plot twist so very needed. Best performance goes to the bad dubbing-over for the psychic.
B00005JME0|4.0|No writing histrionics here, nor much of spectacular acting. The plot gets confusing every so often and occasionally even gets so self-involved that one forgets what actually happened in the first place.<br />But to be fair, the film beat my (typically high) expectations. The premise of the film, the mood of impending doom, and the fact that you really do end up caring about the characters more than make up for its shortcomings. The raw emotion is positively startling -- be prepared for a fair deal of gore and terrifying effects caused by the smallest action and the unpredictable outcomes.<br />Finally, the ending is thankfully non-Disney. You'll leave with a good taste if you manage to keep track of the plot itself.<br />Recommended for some weekend popcorn.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Britney Spears is a joke to society. her music is as unoriginal as her image. She has no business even having records let alone &quot;singing&quot;.i would rather stab pencils in my ears than listen to this joke of a musician.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Someone else wrote a similar review, so I'm just affirming here: Lost in Translation is one of the best films of this year. It's beautiful, real and emotional and the acting is fantastic. <BR>The DVD however is junk. There's no chapter slip inside- just some advertisement for a beer company in Japan. You can't skip through the trailer after trailer at the beginning and the deleted scenes, while nice, are somewhat lacking. I expected a lot more. <BR>DO get this movie or at least watch it. But wait for a better DVD version to come out.
B000002J7U|5.0|I don't particularly care for new age music as stand alone entertainment.  I find it works extremely well as background music for films, especially futuristic films, but sorely lacks interest as real stand alone music.<br />After listening to Voices for a few years I've come to the conclusion that it is the only new age thing I've heard that is successful because Vangelis has found a way to find accompaniment within the music itself.  What it is accompanying I haven't the slightest idea but it certainly isn't standing alone as simple new age music.  Maybe its the voices or the organic rhythms, I don't know.

B000089RVX|4.0|This cd is filled with well orchestrated tracks as well as rock/metalish tracks too.  It's orgranized very well, and the songs flow smoothly from one song to the next and the transitions are very nice to listen to.  <br />Going Under:  At first you may make an assumption that is way to early to make for this song...listen to the rest of it you'll love it.  It has nice guitars,bass,and the voice (as on every song) is very haunting/beautiful/strong.  Who doesn't love the long &quot;I&quot; part. Song Rating: 10/10<br />Bring Me To Life:  Who doesn't know this song?  Need i review this one?  It's one of my favs. on the album and i wouldn't mind if paul mcoy was in the song or not ;) but this song sounds great and has a good meaning woven into it.  Song Rating: 10/10<br />Everybody's Fool:  This song has some really nice sounding guitars and choir as well.  It can also be kind of catchy, especially in the chorus.  Song Rating: 7/10<br />My Immortal:  God, this song is truly amazing!  It's beautiful...it has true heartfelt lyrics and her voice is soothing and is also very powerful and strong at the climax of the song.  Man, this has got to be one of my fav. songs ever.  This song is well done...and there's also a band version too, you should check that out too...i'm gonna have to be a little unfair on this one:)  Song Rating: 12/10 ;)<br />Haunted:  This one has a haunting tune and voice to it and it sounds pretty cool.  This one is a mix of metalish rock with some haunting sounds as well as a haunting choir at parts.  Song Rating:9/10<br />Tourniquet:  Again it has some haunting tunes in it and it also sounds really good.  At times it can sound techno-ish...but that's at very few parts...The end has a very pleasant orchestra tune.  Song Rating: 8/10<br />Imaginary:  This is probably my fav. non-ballad song on the cd.  It has a very cool orchestrated opening that transitions/flows from the previous one (tourniquet).  Again it has haunting vocals but still they sound verybeautful.  Song Rating: 10/10<br />Taking Over Me:  For some reason this is my least fav. track on the album.  It's probably just the way it sounds...i'm not sure.  It just doesn't click with me, but that's something you will have to decide for yourself.  The chorus is very nice though:)  Song Rating: 7/10<br />Hello:  This is the second ballad.  It's just amy lee and the piano, a great combination.  It's very &quot;soothing&quot; in the way it sounds and relaxing and the lyrics are good,though they are emotional they are still very nice.  Song Rating: 9/10<br />My Last Breath:  It has a techno tune at some parts and it's also mixed with guitars and some strings.  This song is pretty good.  Song Rating: 8/10<br />Whisper:  I like this song a lot.  It has a very nice tune to it and as well as some other effects that sound techno-ish...the guitars are cool as well as the vocals.  The middle of the song is really interesting sounding and pretty cool to listen to and the lyrics are good too.  The only part that i don't like about this song, is it's ending.  It has some choir repeating a chant in latin, i think.  And translated it means something like: save me from the evil or dark, i'm not sure. It would sound nice if it wasn't repeated so much at the end, but then it could be just me.  You'll need to decide for yourself.  Song Rating: 10/10<br />Hope my review helps whoever is curious about Evanescence's Fallen.  It's a wonderful album and i'm glad i bought it.  It's worth the money:)
B000089RVX|4.0|It's hard to pin down exactly who (or what) Evanescence is.  Too dark to be a CCM group yet too spiritual to be thrashing heavy metal death rockers, Amy Lee and her moody crew seem to fall somewhere in-between.  But, then, the group clearly anticipated this dilemma:  After all, they named their band \\"Evanescence\\" for a reason.<br />This shapeless quality is exactly what makes Evanescence such a captivating group--and FALLEN such an enigmatic and fascinating debut album.  Singer/songwriter Lee combines her chilling vocals with plaintive, darkly introspective lyrics and modern hard rock beats.  The end result?  An album that revels in its darkness while acknowledging the beauty of light.<br />The nu-metal formula of the record, though, tends to overpower this undercurrent of spirituality.  \\"Bring Me to Life,\\" Evanescence's first single, rocketed into the Billboard stratosphere, thanks to its layering of Lee's voice and Linkin Park-esque screeching guitars.  \\"Going Under\\" figures as its predecessor, using overpowering synth beats. More poignant songs like \\"Tourniquet\\" and \\"Haunted\\" get lost underneath all of these synth beats.  That's not to say these songs aren't good; indeed, they are evocative and somewhat moving.  Yet they fail to capture the spirit of FALLEN.<br />The one song on FALLEN that finally hits the evocative mark, defines the spirit of the music, is \\"My Immortal.\\"  Here, Lee's aching, astonishing voice wraps around the tale of love and loss.  This one song is worth the price of the entire album.<br />Is Evanescence Christian?  Rock?  Heavy metal?  No one is quite sure, and the band itself won't say.  Whatever it is, Evanescence has a sound that uses darkness to illustrate the power of light.  With more hidden gems like \\"My Immortal,\\" the group outshine many other new acts.
B000099T2L|5.0|When Kelly Rowland's solo CD was released, I thought she showed Beyonce a few things, but it seems the other way around has happened.  While Kelly's went gold and was totally forgotten about after only a few weeks, Beyonce's has thrived, going double platinum, staying on the charts for over 6 months, and launching 2 #1 hits and one currently in the top 5.  Kelly's CD was a decent effort, but Beyonce's CD is perhaps best described as a phenomenal achievment.<br />Beyonce Knowles has such a stunning voice that can only enthrall people when they hear it.  But even so, she can even record some of the catchiest songs to the point that it's in your head for the next 2 months.  Case in point is her smash &quot;Crazy in Love,&quot; which in the blink of an eye made us all dance and sing along with her, and skyrocketed to the top of the hot 100.  To this day, that song gets me going and energized, and is worth the price of the CD if only for that song.  She has other songs that are just as good, up to but not limited to &quot;Baby Boy,&quot; &quot;Me, Myself and I,&quot; &quot;Be With You,&quot; and &quot;Naughty Girl.&quot;  <br />The material on this CD is all first rate, and Beyonce clearly worked very hard to make this worth your cash.  No doubt it is, but the CD is not perfect.  The only flaw with the CD (and it is not too terrible) is that it gets too ballad heavy after the peppy beginning tracks, seemingly dragging just as you got yourself pumped for a good time.  The ballads are worth a spot on this collection, even the &quot;Dangerously in Love 2&quot; that is just a recycled track from Destiny's Child's Survivor CD.  If you haven't been entranced by Beyonce's music yet, now's the time to get started!

Get this CD and listen to &quot;The Supernatural&quot;, Peter Green's Scorpionic mid-sixties instrumental. Deep and expansive, this track is head and shoulders above the rest of the album. &quot;Black Magic Woman&quot; and many of Carlos Santana's guitar excursions are firmly based on this first-ever Green tune.<BR>Peter Green has been mentioned alongside many guitarists. But, he truly stands alone. He had Hendrix's expansiveness and a depth that no other guitarist approached, white OR black. Yes, that sounds outrageous and the tracks on this LP won't substantiate that claim. But, that one track will show where this 19 year-old was about to go. By the time he quit at 24, he was somewhere very special. If you are into Clapton, Beck or Page, you probably won't understand what all the fuss is about this Peter Green guy. But, if you want to FEEL...there is no better guitarist to experience. <br />The rest of the album is very good to poor. Mayall can sound excellent, as on &quot;Someday After Awhile&quot; or terrible &quot;A Hard Road&quot;. The rythm section is solid and Aynsley Dunbar was one of the most interesting drummers around. He sounded like a &quot;lead&quot; instrument at the kit. But, Green hated it. He thought it was too busy! The man was such an incredible stickler for FEELING.<br />Buy this if you're willing to separate the wheat from the chaff.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I'll never forget the first time I heard one of Josh Groban's songs.  I thought it was so beautiful, his wonderful voice gave me chills!  I couldn't believe it when I bought the first CD, that he was only like 18 or 19!  The second CD far exceeded my expectations, especially since People Magazine completely dissed it.  Josh, I hope you don't read People.  Their review would have made me quit singing.  Please continue providing all your fans with your incredible singing talents!
B0000C6E4D|4.0|It's always been a personal source of fascination to me how when I think of some of my all time favorite songs and CD's, then try to remember back to the first time I heard them, I realize that I never &quot;get it&quot; right away.<br />Don't get me wrong, I can approximate a CD's value, but never can I, at first listen, be moved and inspired like I am at my 50th.<br />This CD is typical Sarah to me.  Like her last two, I had them playing in the background a few times, letting them tug on my musical awareness, building familiarity until I needed to hear them everyday.<br />Afterglow is just that.  Give it a few listens and her typical musical genius well take root.<br />Enjoy...
B00000AOUD|5.0|This album is truly a masterpiece. If you don't own it - buy it!At first the album is hard to get into, but it grows on you. It's a shame that the radio stations just don't play the whole album. Side one for those who remember records or track one for those who now have the CD is the typical Tull sound and experimentation with with music. But it wasn't really until I dove into side/track two that I realized the album was a masterpiece. Sit by yourself and crank up the volume. An extroadinary display of talent. The combination of the unique instruments is awesome, especially John Evan's organ playing and the introduction of an electric violin. So awesome I wish I could walk into a big cathedral somewhere and hear the echoing sounds of side two played live with the return of John Evan beating on the keys of a large pipe organ! Truly one of the best albums to ever go down in rock history!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Besides any controversy caused by her stardom news, Britney Spears triumph with her welcome return &quot;In The Zone&quot;, although a cheesy name for her greatest album released yet.  Somehow the first single released &quot;Me Against The Music&quot; didn't click that much with the radio and the masses, but the second single &quot;Toxic&quot; it's all about what she sihgs about, definetly toxic, the beats, the voice, the lyrics, this single should bring back Britney to the top 10.  &quot;In The Zone&quot; does not try to be nothing that it's not, it's a pure POP album, with great done songs, maybe it sound refreshing because simply she got work with different producers than her previous albums.  Highlights on this album are her euro-dance &quot;Breathe On Me&quot;, her autobiography-l.a. style song &quot;Outeragous&quot;, her unbelieveble team with Moby &quot;Early Mornin'&quot;(who taught computer guy could produce a song as fine as this). Some songs still sound like old Britney, like &quot;Showdown&quot;, the lame ballad &quot;Everytime&quot; , that by the way are the low points here as well as &quot;Brave New Girl&quot;. But at the end this is one of Britney greatest acomplished, an album that could get her back on the top 40 radio airplay.
B00005Y7PS|2.0|Just flashes. Anno Mundi (4/5) being the best song here and what a great kick-off. The Sabbath Stones (3.5/5) is quite good also, but all the rest MAY grow on you, or in the case of tracks like 'Feels Good To Me' (0/5) they are throw-aways the first time you hear them. Sad too because the production is generally great. All the levels are in place, Tony sounds pretty good, it just comes down to the songs... they just don't amount to much making this more of an EP if you take out the good ones. If you are looking for life after Dio, there isn't much here. Better than Born Again for sure, but not even fit to tie Sabotages shoes.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|...unfortunately, the DVD falls short.  This is one of the few half decently funded movies where fans were allowed to make the movie instead of studio suck-ups (not that there isn't a time and a place for studio suck-up movies, and by the standards of theatrical releases this movie was under-funded).<br />The DVD lacks deleted scenes, which having read the novelization I'm well familiar with, but this is excusable because the commentary explained how they weren't allowed the time to do enough shoots, and many scenes were cut simply because they couldn't be made to look right in the editing room.<br />The other problem was the lack of the documentary &quot;Fang vs. Fiction&quot; which had been made to promote the movie, I can't understand WHY they'd cut it, it showed the basis of this war in real legends.  There supposedly WAS a war between vampires and their former werewolf slaves in the 1400s.
B00000ADG2|5.0|I have to say that this cd is one of my favorites in my collection of 300+. I fell in love with Lauryn's voice in Sister Act 2 and then became an instant fan of the Fugees. Her voice is strong and beautiful and her lyrics are powerful and meaningful. I recommend this cd to EVERYONE!
B00004TH83|2.0|Normally, I ignore every critic in the book when it comes to pop artists, because they tend to over dramatize everything that is wrong with that particular artist. Sadly, this time the reviewer wasn't exaggerating.<br />I first heard Lara Fabian when I was searching for a Josh Groban song on the Internet. When I heard Always &amp; Forever, I was impressed and I decided to give her a try. I bought the CD, and although she does vocally compare to Celine Dion, she still fell short of my expectations.<br />I am impressed that she writes all of her material, but you still have to be able to sell it, and Lara just didn't do that with me. Her vocals and her words don't mesh well together, and she ends up doing just like the reviewer said, way too much vocal gymnastics. I'm glad she's passionate about her words, but she needs to take it down a notch and really work more on being melodic, and not trying to outdo Celine.<br />This album has its moments and I do admit to enjoying Broken Vow (although it could never measure up to Josh Groban's version), Givin' Up On You, You're Not From Here and the ballad version of I Will Love Again (which isn't even on the album). I hope Laura's next American effort is just as powerful song wise and accentuates her strong points, rather then her negative.
B00003CXSP|3.0|This movie is a paen to political correctness (believe it or not). Those who have read the book have an idea where I'm headed. First, like most of the other reviewers, I would agree that this is a very well done movie from a purely technical standpoint. I don't think anyone could take issue with the cinematography, direction, acting, etc. <BR>HOWEVER<BR>The people who made the movie blinked when it came to staring at the ending.<BR>The book took a road that made a lot of politically correct folks really uncomfortable and basically eliminated Jodie Foster outright. She simply would never play a part that required her to embrace the weaknesses and depths of the character that the book outlined. No matter that the Starling of the book actually becomes the dominant member of the pair in the end, Ms Foster as the rest of the PC crowd, saw only the mid process. There was a period of manipulation and subjugation that was uncomfortable to observe, and descriptions of the relationship that were brutally straightforward. Too bad, really, as I was keenly anticipating watching Clarice become someone that could make Dr Lechter fall under the spell of his own creation and become subject to the need to serve a perfect &quot;mate&quot;. I believe Foster missed a complex Oscar possibility.
B00005AAFS|3.0|Rammstein have found a particular, personal place among current rock world, defining a sound and attitude of their own. They mix heavy guitars with techno-oriented elements, gothic atmospheres and experimental electronica. &quot;Mutter&quot;, their third record, is probably their more consistent album to date, reducing the at times tiresome heaviness and noise and adopting a more mellow, sparse and moody sound. <BR>The german band achieves some great moments here, like the epic &quot;Sonne&quot;, the edgy and strong &quot;Ich Will&quot; or the dense, cold &quot;Nebel&quot;. The lyrics are still on german, which gives a more menacing, austere side to the songs, and the band`s image is darker, futuristic and stranger than ever. &quot;Mutter&quot; is a solid piece of good, innovative and strong rock.
B000002UB6|5.0|Generally regarded as the weakest record the Fab Four ever released, Let It Be has unjustly become the least appreciated Beatles album.  With the release of Let It Be...Naked, a newly remastered, un-produced version of the album, I feel that the original record released in 1970 is in need of some defense.  Recorded after the monolith \\"White Album\\", the project began as Paul McCartney's idea to return to the band back to it's stripped down, rock n' roll roots.  This was probably the most tension-filled period of Beatle existence, and George Harrison even quit the band for a short time during recording.  Eventually, the band gave up and sent the tapes to legendary \\"wall of sound\\" pioneer Phil Spector to produce a releasable album.  Let It Be was the result.  The general consensus is that Spector butchered the album with his production on songs like George's \\"I Me Mine\\", John's \\"Across the Universe\\", and especially Paul's \\"The Long and Winding Road\\".  I strongly disagree:  \\"I Me Mine\\" was a short fragment of a song until Spector looped one of the verses and turned it into one of Harrison's finest Beatles contributions; \\"Across the Universe\\" was a tossed off acoustic number that John supposedly hated, but with the Spector production it becomes a soaring, majestic classic.  Finally, Paul was infuriated when he heard the Spector version of his \\"Long and Winding Road\\", and many fans agreed that the song's production was overdone.  I don't think so:  the song itself was an overblown pop number, and without Spector's touches it just sounds like an awkwardly produced overblown pop number.  <br /> The rest of the album is comprised of the raw rock n' roll songs that were products of the original intent of the sessions.  \\"Two of Us\\" is a strong acoustic duet between Paul and John; \\"Dig a Pony\\" is a hard hitting song penned by Lennon that is reminiscent of his own \\"Instant Karma\\".  Everyone has heard the classic title track, one of the most beautiful songs the band ever recorded.  \\"I've Got a Feeling\\" is a raw, exciting track consisting of two song ideas combined into one for a wonderful effect.  The whole album carries a careless, even funny atmosphere, mostly due to the various snippets of studio chatter and the short jam tracks (\\"Dig It\\" and \\"Maggie Mae\\") that are interspersed throughout.  The hilarious and unforgettable John Lennon comment after the classic album closer \\"Get Back\\" is the perfect cap to the record that is basically a snapshot of the Beatles as a creative unit whilst they were falling apart at the seams.  For this reason alone it is an essential purchase for any rock fan, but fortunately it is laced with spectacular songs that seal its place as an underrated rock classic.  <br /> On a separate note, I strongly advise first time listeners out there to purchase this before the bastardized Let It Be...Naked, which exists only for McCartney to get rid of Spector's production.  Even more irritating is the fact that the jovial atmosphere that made the original so special is totally lost on the reissue due to the absence of the enjoyable jam tracks and deletion of ALL studio chatter.  The fact is that the original Let It Be best represented the Beatles vision (Lennon actually liked it, George has passed away, and Ringo is Ringo).  Don't buy into McCartney's singular vision.  Just hear this record.
B00002MZ4W|3.0|One of the most interesting singer-songwriters out there, Fiona Apple follows her debut &quot;Tidal&quot; with this worthwile, well-accomplished release. Although a bit too short, this is a fine album, intense and captivating enough to deserve some repeated listens. <BR>These are personal bitterswet love songs, performed by a unique voice whose talent keeps growing. The lyrics and song structures are edgy and creative, a lot better than most of the stuff edited by some more mainstream &quot;divas&quot;. <BR>The shining moments include &quot;To Your Love&quot;, &quot;The way Things Are&quot; and the catchy single &quot;Fast As You Can&quot;, where Apple mixes pop and jazz in a more innovative way than, say, the overrated Norah Jones. Fiona Apple is a girl worth watching, as she will probably release great things in the future. This is a good, hypnotic set of songs from a promising alternative-mainstream star.
B00008PW2E|5.0|I can't find anywhere to download it - only season 3!<BR>And HBO should bloody well release it already
B000094J5W|1.0|This comedy (?) follows the adventures of three friends (played by Luke Wilson, Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn) who can`t seem to adapt to their adult lives, so they try to return to their youth and form a fraternity. The movie then presents us countless cliches around beer, cute young girls, parties, trite rap music and inane, tepid jokes. <BR>&quot;Old School&quot; isn`t entertaining or original, and has only two or three funny moments that can`t redeem the hollowness and state of boredom created during most of it`s running time. This is just worthless, which is not a big surprise since the director`s (Todd Phillips) previous movie was the equally boring &quot;Road Trip&quot;, and even that one was a bit better than this. Another picture to avoid.
B00007LTIA|1.0|A huge let down from the quality of the yes album,fragile,close to the edge & yessongs.Don't waste your money or time on this one.The joke at the time of the album's release back in the 70's was that Yes finally went over the edge!
0380002930|5.0|I personaly didnt like Watership Down but that doesnt mean it isnt a good book. Watership Down was a good book in the way that it was written well.Also it would be a good book for anyone who likes bunnys and advencher.
B00009UW0N|5.0|This film is undoubtably the greatest slasher of all time, unless your a grandparent then your still with Psycho, which is still good. But both have had a big impact, but with Halloween being called the second scariest film of all time under The Exorcist the older does not mean the wiser. It is pacted with everything a slasher or just any horro should have, good kills, suspense, good characters, and the most important scary asss music which Halloween has claimed to this day as maybe the scariest. Well enough said if you don't buy it, your an idiot if you like good horror. Price may be an issue so just go to Best Buy keep it on the down low ssshhhh......
B0000VCZK2|3.0|If there were ever a reason to buy all four of the movies ALIEN in one set, it would probably be to see just how you take a great premise and classic storyline and beat it to death with a shovel.  In 1979, Ridley Scott, working off of the wonderful script by Dan O'Banon and Ronald Schusett and the drawings of H.R. Gieger, set out to make a sci-fi film the likes of which had never been seen in film.  And it would never be repeated again.  It would only be (in this order), reinvented, rehashed, and recycled.<br />7 years later, Mastre Directore to be James Cameron came up to 20th C. Fox studios with an answer to the \\"how to make a second Alien Movie\\" problem, and the bid for director of the project.  Not only did he end up honoring the directing abilities of the great Ridley Scott, he ended up making a wonderful addition to the sci-fi genre and the Alien franchise.<br />The first two movies alone are enough of a reason to buy this set (if it were not for the fact that they were released independently of eachother...a smart move by the guys at 20cFox)<BR>Then comes the two consecutive dissapointments in order of lousiness.<br />1992: Soon to be \\"Fight Club\\" Conductor David Fincher is brought on to helm the third installment of the \\"soon to dwindle\\" franchise.  With all of the other survivers we had grown to love from the second movie gone, we're left with the cookie cutter rehash of the Alien and Aliens Premise.  \\"We're all going to die, and Ripley is the only one to save us.\\"  Fincher knew how to direct, it's just that everything else underneath that production seemed to fizzle.<br />And Finally: the Triumph de Lousy...Resurrection.  As films go, this movie makes Paul W.S. Anderson look like Frederico Felini (by no fault of Jean Pierre Jeunet, the wonderful director of Amelie and City of lost Children, which is much more his forte).  Ripley is cloned, has sex with the alien queen birthed from her, and is a conundrum of \\"for/against\\" human survival backwardsism that just end up confusing us.  The only reason to watch this film of the wrongly labeled \\"Quadrilogy\\" is to see how far wrong you can go in this now 35 year old franchise.<br />No movie collection is ever perfect.  In Godfather it was the part III, in Indiana Jones it was Temple of Doom, and in the new star wars films...yeah it was pretty much all of them.  But that doesn't mean we shouldn't dive in and examine what's been done.  Buy the movies...watch them, and make your own conclusions.  Just don't expect yourself to be able to sit through all of them more than once.<br />`Revu
B00003CX5P|1.0|George Lucas does not believe for one single second that he did anything wrong with The Phantom Menace. He's living in a fog. Episode I of the Star Wars saga is a shockingly bad film, filled with atrocious writing, directing, and acting. Even the editing on the film stinks---too many damn wipes. No film director with a good head on his or her shoulders would've let Jake Lloyd &amp; Natalie Portman's wooden performances stand as they are. But Lucas doesn't have a clue about directing his actors, or what a good film performance truly is. As long as his actors say their lines and don't bump into furniture, that's good enough for him. Sure, there's great special effects, but so what? There's too much talking, too much sitting around (or standing around), and not enough action. Too much emphasis on the special effects and not enough on the script or story. Too much Jar Jar Binks and not enough Obi-Wan. And don't get me started on that &quot;medaclorian&quot; nonsense or Anakin's virgin birth. Lucas already tarnished the Star Wars saga back in 1983 with those cuddly wuddly Ewoks from Return Of The Jedi, but now, he has destroyed the saga completely with The Phantom Menace. Attack Of The Clones was a little bit better, but that isn't really much of a compliment. And the upcoming Episode III? I couldn't care less. Furthermore, Lucas has been officially blown out of the water by Peter Jackson, who is now the new king of the sci-fi/fantasy genre with his brilliant Lord Of The Rings films. George Lucas WAS a great filmmaker way back when. But, as evidenced by these lame prequel movies, he has totally lost it. For Star Wars fans everywhere, this is a terrible, terrible tragedy.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|Stephen Schwartz, the master composer behind Working, Pipin, Godspell, and Children of Eden returns with a rompin good time musical based off of the novel &quot;Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West&quot; by Gregory Maguire, and for the most part it's &quot;wicked&quot;.  However, it does have it's strange Oz'isms that range from recording quirks to odd lyrics and just strange vocal direction.  <br />Kristin Chenoweth, the bubbly sally from You're a Good Man Charlie Brown, returns to broadway with avengence in this musical as Glinda, the Good witch of the North while Idina Menzel, formerly of Rent and Andrew Lippa's Wild Party, Stands in as the kiwi colored Wicked Witch of the West.  <br />While the music really hits both of their strengths vocally, they both have very nasal sounding voices, which don't really contrast well and just make it hard to listen to at times, especially when Idina goes for the high notes.  However, Chenoweth, with the greater range, hits the operettic sections like a musical theater champ, though they are few and far between.  In the end, she gets stuck with the campier songs of the litter.  Norbert Leo Butz, better known for his wonderful performance in Last Five Years, gets stuck playing second fiddle in a role that doesn't show off enough of his talents, while Joel Grey, the wonderful MCee of Cabaret reborn as the &quot;Wonderful&quot; Wizard of Oz, also ends up with one song that just about hits the realm of vaudvillian showtune and stops before it heads into the realm of reprise land.  <br />All that said, it's still a fun musical...just not Schwartz's best.  To be perfectly honest, there are about 5 songs that really hit the mark, and the rest seem to work as between scene filler than true hallmark musical theater pieces...the kind that we know and love from Mr. Schwartz.  These include Defying Gravity, which will prove to be the true hit of this show, Popular, a nifty little number for Chenoweth, As Long as yourMine, the love song with a &quot;wicked&quot; edge as sung by Butz and Menzel, and No Good Deed, the Final Straw song for wonderful Menzel.  <br />Then of course there's the opening theme, which is catchy enough to make this show grab you from beginning to end (while you're watching it) but is less effective on the cd alone.<br />For my money, the Closing number is rather dissapointing just in the realm of what the &quot;Closing Number&quot; is supposed to represent.  It's only about a minutes worth of music, and just about closes the piece without really saying anything of what just happened.  <br />In defense of Mr. Schwartz, unlike his contemporary of the same name Stephen Sondheim, Schwartz is much more rooted in the rock/pop area of musical theater and is not nearly as good a lyricist as the famed Sondheim, so don't expect that.  However, if you like a good time musical, then Stephen Schwartz has definatly delivered.  However, as always, I recommend seeing the musical before buying the cd, so you go in with unbiased eyes and ears.  And just remember folks &quot;No one mourns the wicked&quot;...but life would be quite boring if there wasn't a little bit of wickedness in all of us...(the good kind of course)<br />`Revu
B0000VD04M|4.0|The rumor going around as to why this title has been delayed is so Touchstone Pictures could capitalize on possible wins at this year's Oscars by two of the film's actors:  Johnny Depp and Bill Murray.  Therefore, the studio can market the film as featuring \\"Oscar Winners Johnny Depp and Bill Murray!\\"  Pretty weak reason to p*ss off legions of film buffs.  Nevertheless, Ed Wood still stands as Tim Burton's greatest film.  Perhaps, it's worth the wait...
0380733358|5.0|Eye of The Needle is a super-great WWII spy thriller that takes place in England right before D-Day.  The Germans have had spies planted in England since before the War started.  The British have slowly but surely been catching them.  Now they have come across Germany's #1 spy and he is bound and determined to make it back to Germany at all cost with Allied top secret information that will change the course of the war!  This book will keep you at the edge of your seat throughout the whole story.  This was my first book that I've read from Ken Follett.  I have already ordered all of his other WWII books; I can't wait!!!
B00004YW6I|4.0|Great sounding record. Many of the live boots from her last tour contained great versions of her earlier work, i.e., previous albums. However, I prefer her 'Stories..' songs as they sound on this record instead (as opposed to live versions). What I think this means is that the best elements of these songs are the way they sound and are produced, the beauty and lushness of them, as represented on this studio record. In other words, they require studio perfection to sound their best. However, for me, this is her least interesting album lyrically. Her previous albums were a little more challenging, had more interesting subtext to them. In fact, I think much of her B-side material from this era is superior to at least a couple tracks on the 'Stories..' album.<br />With that being said, still there are many songs to admire here, particularly 'kamikaze', 'big exit', 'beautiful feeling' among others. Polly Jean Harvey at her worst is still better than most others at their best, so please don't take my critique too harshly.<br />Oh, and btw. Mick Harvey, who plays on and helped produce this album, is NOT PJs brother. Just good friends who happen to coincidently have the same last name. They've known each other due to Micks affiliation with Nick Cave, being in the Bad Seeds. He's perhaps the most important member of that band and the connection was made during the time that PJ and Nick were a couple. (A little off topic, I know, but worth mentioning).
0385507755|1.0|I hated this book.  I wanted to read it because a have a couple of family members with addiction problems who recovered on their own without AA.  The author's style of writing is terrible and I think his story could have been told just as well without the choppy sentences and probably a record number of F words in any book I have ever read. I also don't beleive the story of the dental procedures done without any novocane.  Sounds like something from &quot;Marathon Man&quot;.  If he had had a ruptured appendix, would they have removed it without any anesthesia?  A person can go into shock from pain and I have never heard of the use of novocane triggering any relapse in an addict.  After all, it is injected into the nerve, not the bloodstream.
B00000AFFI|5.0|This album is certainly different than PJs previous ones, and a little disappointing for me initially for just that very reason. It was the second album of hers that I had ever heard, after 'To Bring You My Love', and quite a bit different. Eventually, I grew to love this one as well, if not quite as much as 'TBYML'. But this is what PJ does. She moves on to explore other ideas, never wanting to repeat herself. It's a challenge she places on herself, and by extension, on her fans. <br />I love how she incorporates different elements into her music, but never really talks much about her sources for inspiration, leaving some mystery intact. St. Catherine lore, Flannery O'Connor stories, and Nick Cave break-up relationship issues are but a few elements that inform the songs on this record. Never in a heavy-handed sort of way, mind you. These influences have been recognized by fans over time. Someone reads an O'Connor story, and notices very close similarities to the song 'Joy', for example, incorporating a character from it into the main subject of the song. These different themes or topics for songs are always worked in with subtlety, mystery, never with banal obviousness.<br />And no, PJ is not a lesbian (insert famous Seinfeld line here!). I say this because there are a few songs on this record that the romantic character being sung about is a woman, so the uninitiated wonder, \\"does this mean Polly's gay?\\". Polly has stated that when she writes songs, she'll sing from either a female or male perspective, never really differentiating the two all that much. Hence, the confusion on the issue, especially on this record where 'Catherine', 'No Girl, So Sweet', 'Perfect Day Elise' and 'Electric Light' all have females being sung about from a perspective of \\"desire\\" for them.<br />This album contains the most studio enhancements of any so far. If you like raw and straight for the jugular Polly, this one isn't quite it. Though it still does contain some of the best of PollyJean Harvey traits: passion, drama, mystery, excitment, it adds more production layering and more third person songwriting perspectives. It is probably her darkest record to date. It lacks some of the subtle humor employed in her previous records. But if you like dark songwriting, and like some occasional dance beats and other studio enhancements, you will likely enjoy this record too. Even if you don't like all of it, there will likely be at least a few songs you'll adore. Afterall, there is no such thing as a bad PJ Harvey record.
0385335482|5.0|I bought this book because lately it seems that all the good books are coming from the other side of the world (England vs United States).  Am I glad that I bought the book because it is one of the funniest books I have ever read.  I think what I most like about the books are the letters from Becky's bank and creditors.  I too was once chased by creditors and unfortunately they were not as sympathetic as the creditor's in Becky's life were.  I laughed out loud when I read the excuses she would give them in order not to meet with them.<br />Becky is a likeable character and what makes this book really work is the conversations she has in her head when she is about to buy something frivolous.  I think most people that are reading this book can relate to those conversations where you try and convince yourself that you are doing the world a favor by buying an item that you must have.<br />Needless to say, I went ahead and bought Sophie Kinsella's two other Shopaholic books and did not need to have a conversation with myself although my husband has me on a &quot;strict&quot; budget.  Go ahead, read it.....you will enjoy it.....
0385504209|4.0|Yes, this is a very controversial book.  But it did open up some people's eyes (such as myself) and began asking questions about the church and Christ's personal life.  This book plays with your mind as it keeps throwing facts and evidence.  A good read.

0783240236|5.0|A simple idea that turns to horror. A woman in a bird shop sees a good looking dude come in. She falls for him hard but the dude is playin her for awhile. She finds out where he hangs and buys some birds to take to him. Later they get together and the dude starts to like her too. As romance blossoms, all of a sudden there are groups of birds forming small attacks on the village. The town flips out as ordinary birds begin to attack and peck everyone when they go ouside. Soom there are so many birds everyone is in fear as they rip the dudes house to pieces to get to the people inside. Man, I am tellin it straight up  you will remember this flick forever.. VERY VERY GOOD. The acting is superb and the charcters are all well cast as they draw you in to Hitchcocks evil mind and feel the terror of The Birds.

B00006RINF|4.0|I bought this CD based on the first two songs that I heard at the mall.  On the soundscan.  Love it.  Can't wait to get the other 4 albumns. The only thing I can't stand is that guys voice. Andrea whatever?  Christina is awesome!!  If you have bought all the Lacuna Coil Cd's Check out The Gathering.  There great too.
B00003CXB4|5.0|The Lion King is another of the movies which marked the triumphant return of Disney to center stage. Remember, that after Walt Disney's death, Disney as a company kind of sank into oblivion and did nothing remarkable. After 1989's excellent The Little Mermaid, Disney continued its return in a big way with The Lion King.<br />This is the story of Simba, (Jonathon Taylor Thomas as a youth, Matthew Broderick as an adult) a young cub, who &quot;just can't wait to be king&quot;. He has a powerful father, the king Mufasa (a booming James Earl Jones) and an uncle, the conniving and evil Scar (the devilish Jeremy Irons) who wants the throne that Simba will one day inherit. Scar schemes up a way to kill Mufasa and dispose of Simba permenently, or so he thinks. Simba ends up banished from the Pridelands, where he takes on the newfound attitude of Hakuna Matata(no worries). This is the saying of Timon and Pumba, two new friends. Eventually, Simba must deal with his past, which he finds very difficult.<br />There are two reasons why I consider this to be the best Disney film. For one, the animation is absolutely superb. From the opening &quot;Circle of Life&quot; sequence, showing all the animals in the Pridelands gathering to celebrate the birth of Simba, to the final battle between Scar and Simba, the attention to detail and vivid color is breathtaking. Especially on this new DVD edition, this movie is a sight to see. The second reason I love this as the best Disney film is the villain, Scar. Unlike most other Disney villains, who are almost a joke (Ursula, Malevecent, Gaston, the evil stepmother), Scar is truly evil and he is a scary character. Jeremy Irons was the perfect choice for the voice.<br />For that reason, I would recommend you keep this movie away from the very young. This is an adult cartoon. There is much violence and adult material. A father dies, an uncle tries to kill his young nephew several times, and the evil elephant graveyard has an ominous appearance. Very small children would struggle with this film, so keep that in mind.<br />In all, the story, animation, characters, voices, and appearance make this DVD a must own. The extended feature is somwhat overrated- the song &quot;Morning Report&quot; is unnecessary and a waste of time. The second disc features several making of tours and some games that would be fun to play with children. I recommend making this film a part of your collection.
B00005JME0|3.0|Ashton Kutcher did ok, his best film yet, he's not being a goof for once which was different for him ,but he put it off and did a decent job, hope he keeps it up.Amy Smart is also in the film and does well .The plot was a little off the hook mind twisting to see what was real or was anything real at all.Evan Treborn (Kutcher)trys to make life the best he can for himself ,as a kid he had black outs and was told to write down everything he could in a journal, after years gone by he read the journal and starts to put pices together, from the black outs he had as a kid, and really goes back in time in his own mind to sees if his life could of have been different by differnt incidence's being changed, some which can be disturbing to some.Sound a little confusing it can be but not a bad movie so get ready for the effect it has on you and Enjoy!!!
0688163173|5.0|It's a long time since a book - especially a thriller - had this affect on me.  I DID guess a lot of the solution before the end (being good at crosswords helped) but I was still absolutely gobsmacked by the ending.  My advice would be to buy this book now and read it - you won't be disappointed.  Now I need to get my hands on his other books ...
0385504209|5.0|This is a book of fiction, which incorporates many historical anecdotes regarding Christ's life.  Having never heard any of these anecdotes, I thoroughly enjoyed the \\"alternative\\" theories explored in the book.  Nowhere does the author force feed the reader any particular version of the \\"truth,\\" but rather he allows the reader to think for him/herself.<br />The storyline, I thought, was fast-paced and exciting.  The more I read, the more I felt at ease with some of my own personal views that would contradict those of organized religion.  I think the best aspect of the book is that it harmonizes the literal interpretations of religion with artistic interpretations of it.  The truth, as is often the case, most likely lies somewhere in between.  I felt at peace with my own views after reading this book, and therefore felt enlightened.<br />Finally, as is the theme of the book itself, read the book and judge for yourself whether you like it or not.  I personally, loved it; you may not, but decide for yourself!  That is the essence of religion freedom.
B00005AQE8|5.0|This is a great cd.  I can never get tired of listening to it.  It has some funky beats and powerful lyrics.  Tupac Shakur was one of the most brilliant musicians of the 20th century and wrote some powerful lyrics.  After I first listened to this cd, I really had a hard time listening to any other rap because it goes downhill from this one.

0440219078|5.0|Lois Lowry does a wonderful job creating a futuristic/utopian  society. There is one person chosen in the society that has to hold all of the memories from the past.  The chosen one is a 12 year old boy named Jonas.  Once the Giver has successfully passed on all of the memories, Jonas alone will have all of the infomation from the past- good and bad.  When Jonas starts to feel the true pains and pleasures in life there's no turning back.  He has to make a decision based on his limited knowledge at the risk of hurting everyone in the society.  Maybe living in a utopian society would be nice.  Being told how and what to do at all times, but how do you deside who is in charge?  Is it possible to let someone else controle your every move?  This is the kind of society that Jonas has lived in for 12 years. How would you react if you suddenly had the freedom to think for yourself?  You will have to read the book to find out what he decides.
B00000J7JO|4.0|After 1991's 'Bloodsugarsexmagik', the Chili's became mega famous. The album threw them into rocks big boy league with hits such as 'Give it away' and 'Under the bridge.' This fame however was too much for their phenomenal guitarist John Frusciante to deal with, and he left the band in the middle of their biggest tour to date.<br />In 1995, while the band were still struggling to cope with various drug addictions, they bought in ex-Jane's addiction guitarist Dave Navarro, and the new look outfir released 'One hot minute.' The album wasn't very well recieved, despite being in my opinion very good, if a little dark. Navarro was unhappy in the band and left, causing most Chili's bands to fear that the end was in sight for them...<br />So imagine the delight of myself and all the Chili's fans in the world, when ex drug-addled guitarist Frusciante is saved from nearly killing himself and brought back into the band 8 years after making the album of their lives! I was in such anticipation of this album release, counting down the weeks/days until it came out.<br />I heard their first single from the album 'Scar Tissue' on the radio a few times before its release, and loved it. It was a more mellow, more tuneful track than anything off their previous offering, and it signalled what was to be the start of huge commercial success. So 7th June 1999 arrived, i bought the CD from the record shop where i worked, hurried home and put it on...<br />'Around the world' - This opening track explodes onto the stereo like a wall of distorted bass guitar. It is a funky as hell track, with an unexpected change of pace when it hits the chorus. A great start to their comeback album.<br />'Parallel Universe' - Fleas fingers work overtime on this one, a medium paced verse breaks into a huge rock sounding chorus, with Kiedis screaming about being a sidewinder and a California kid.<br />'Scar tissue' - Their first single, and it is a fantastic chilled out tune, with a great rhythm and simple guitar solo's which work perfectly. <br />'Otherside' - A great radio friendly track, which has a great video showing the band playing 'instruments' made out of weird objects.<br />'Get on top' - Return to the funk sound of Blood sugar sex magik, staccato rapping from Keidis and Frusciante's Wah wah guitar on overdrive.<br />'Californication' - The title track and an album and live highlight. Keidis's song about life in California has emotive lyrics including a homage to Kurt Cobain who Keidis admired. Another great video accompanies this song.<br />'Easily' - A straight rock song, nothing special, but ok.<br />'Porcelain' - Very slow, very quiet little tune. In no way like anything the Chili's have ever done, and to be quite honest its a track i always skip past. Yawn!!<br />'Emit Remmus' - Summer time backwards, and its about an English girl getting it on with and American man. Quite heavy in parts, but not one of my favourites.<br />'I like dirt' - A short snappy burst of funk, sounding similar to very early Chili's offerings on their first albums. Lyrics don't mean much, but thats not too much of a problem!<br />'This velvet glove' - A nice track, very melodic, quite rocky in the chorus, but tuneful throughout. <br />'Savior' - Qutie a harsh song in contrast to the previous. Again not one of my fave's but ok nonetheless.<br />'Purple stain' - One of my personal album highlights, it has such a groove, so funk filled. Very like Blood sugar. The lyrics are a little risque, with Keidis going on about 'a womans monthly blood...'<br />'Right on time' - A very short snappy penultimate track, its ended by the time you've got into it. They always play this one live and start it with the intro to 'London calling' by the Clash<br />'Road trippin' - A beautiful serene ending to the album, with just acoustic guitars, and lyrics about the bands closeness to one another. <br />All in all, after the wait for this album, few people were disappointed. The only ones who were are people who only like the Chili's when they are loud, brash and funky. Some people don't like the new direction that some of the songs here show. The truth is that yes they have mellowed, but when they made this album, they were all approaching 40. There are still songs on here which prove they can funk and rock with the best of them, but their songwriting skills really started to show through on this album. This album catapulted them into the mainstream in a big big way.<br />The variety on offer on this album will ensure that red hot chili peppers fans young and old, will like some, if not all of it. I'm sure no purchaser will be disappointed.
0385504209|3.0|Two people who know that I have an aversion to reading, \\"what everyone else is reading\\" recommended the Da Vinci Code to me.  They assured me that, despite all the frenzy surrounding the book, it was great!<br />I did read it, and while I read it quickly because something about it did capture my attention, I did not really enjoy it.  I thought it was a clever way for Dan Brown to communicate the massive amount of information he obtained while researching the book, however, I really felt that the book was quite weak.  I think Dan Brown has seen how well John Grisham has done in turning mediocre books into blockbusters and decided he should get in on the action as well.  He even describes the main character as resembling Harrison Ford.<br />The book was entertaining enough for me to finish it, but I wish I had borrowed it from a friend or the library instead of purchasing it.
B0000A02TZ|1.0|I own the original release on dvd.  I purchased the new release Double Secret Probation under the false pretenses that there was a difference.  The few bonus features and lack of quality thereof leave this DVD lacking.<br />Good job hollywood .. and you wonder why everyones stealing movies?
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Those who find it overrated seem to have failed in grasping Sofia's intent of making the viewer feel a dose of culture shock just as Bob and Charlotte do. The small story is of no significant importance, Its the subtle and tender caring for each and every Bob and Charlotte in the world. Go into it with an open mind and try your hardest to not wait for &quot;something to happen&quot;.<br />You might just love it to death as I do.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|This cd was incredible. All the songs sound different and it is completely original. I listen to it over and over again and never tire of it.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Although I've been a huge admirer of both Kristin Chenowith and idina Menzel for a few years now, I was not sure what to expect upon first hearing this soundtrack.  Actually, I ended up seeing the show on broadway, and buying the CD the day after because i couldn't get enough of this music!  Stephen Schwartz has made a brilliant creation, and couldn't have gotten better voices to sing it.  The vocal harmonies are beautiful throughout.  Defying Gravity, the real showstopper (much thanks to Ms. Menzel's UNBELIEVABLE voice), gave me almost as big of a chill when hearing it on the soundtrack as it did in live performance.  Ms. Chenowith's lovely voice carries songs as well, and the song Popular is cute and funny, while showing off her vocal talent.  Aside from Defying Gravity, my favorite songs are I'm Not That Girl (sung by Ms. Menzel), and the love ballad As Long as You're Mine.  It's a fun, entertaining musical more full of emotion than I had expected it would be.  Between Norman Leo Butz, and the two leading women, I can hardly put into words the feeling that their voices produce-  you have to hear it to know!  This is definitely one of the best new broadway shows to come about since RENT, and I hope it has a long, successful run.
B00005JMGL|5.0|I was so shocked. I took my daughter to see this for her 5th birthday, not expecting to be sucked into this cinematic wonder. This is one of the best fantasy films ever made. Usually kid actors ruin pieces, but the Wendy charcter was done to perfection as was the rest of the cast. Visually it reminded me a bit of old Tim Burton films like Bettlegeuse, Edward Scissorhands. The mermaids, the crocodile, the ships, tinkerbell, the cave...everything was shot fantastically! I can't say enough about this one. It is a shame that it cost 100 million to make and has only brought in 49 million as of now, because this one is so superior to all the garbage that Disney has been putting out as of late.<br />sidenote- not only was the film fantastic, but I got more than what I had bargained for, when a lady carrying two buckets of popcorn tripped on the stairs, sending popcorn flying all over the seats. (no, she wasn't hurt and the theatre did not refund her. Ha!)
B000096I9G|4.0|Cure fans will automatically fall in love with this 2 DVD spectacular showing the complete PORNOGRAPHY, DISINTIGRATION AND BLOODFLOWERS albums live (with bonus The Kiss and If Only Tonight We Could Sleep from the KISS ME, KISS ME, KISS ME album). The photography is fantastic, the sound quality is unbelievable and anyway, who cares THIS IS THE CURE!!<br />Personally, I really enjoyed the PORNOGRAPHY set the most, this being my favourite album. The songs, although aged, still sound raw and edgy, just as they did back in 1982. One bad point is during the title track, Pornography, the photography has this ridiculous effect which detracts from the otherwise spellbounding viewing pleasure... :)<br />I think BLOODFLOWERS sucks so don't get me started... DISINTIGRATION is a mellow album, but it is highly enjoyable, and great after a, shall we say \\"indulgent\\" night out... comedown city...<br />Buy it or die...
0345457684|4.0|\\"Altered Carbon\\" is loaded with spine-ripping, skull-cracking violence, and torrid sex. Thankfully it also packs an amazing amount of fantastic technology, and more importantly, thinks through the implications of its imagined advances.<br />The central conceit is that a few centuries from now, human consciousness can be digitized and stored in battery-sized capsules implanted at the base of the skull. A mind can then be downloaded into a new body, at least for those who can afford it. The main character is a sort of former super special forces soldier who turned to crime after his military service. He is pulled out of an earthly but virtual Purgatory and fitted with a new body, or \\"sleeve\\" to investigate a case for a wealthy and ultra-long-lived Earth man. The story gets very complicated from there.<br />The violence is actually rather justified by the world Morgan has created. The ability to switch bodies, live entirely in virtual reality, and buy clones has cut people's bonds to their physical bodies. Physical harm is now classified as \\"organic damage\\", more of a property crime akin to smashing a car's windshield. Morgan does a thorough job of portraying the various implications, from describing the feeling of looking at your new body in a mirror to possible social reactions, like religious opposition to the technology.<br />Morgan is also great at seamlessly weaving in the future history (if there is such a thing), terminology and technology. He largely avoids long expository passages to explain things. Instead he sprinkles hints and asides throughout the story, allowing the reader to piece together their own picture. Among the cool things that bring life and sparkle to Morgan's world are subcutaneous meshes that impart speed, strength and heightened perceptions to users; an automated hotel run by an AI with a Jimi Hendrix theme; a backdrop of a human empire or federation spread out over multiple solar systems; a long-gone Martian civilization. You are definitelyleft wanting to know more about this bizarre and remarkable future.<br />There are shortcomings, but just a few. Some plot points didn't quite feel right to me. For instance, the main character is painted initially as a pretty bad man, but sort of becomes a paragon of selfless virtue by the end. Another, much more minor, point is that going into virtual storage for a century or two is often raised as punishment for serious crimes. Yet we're not quite told what is so bad about it. It seems a convict gets uploaded into storage, falls into a virtual sleep, and then wakes up in a century with a new life in a new world. <br />But given the overall accomplishments of the book, that's a pretty small nit to pick, and I unreservedly recommend the book to those who can stomach intense violence and sex and look forward to the next book from Mr Morgan.
0808514121|4.0|I know most people say this is an incredible awesome book, but as most classics, it has \\"its parts.\\" It has some parts that will keep you sooo interested, but there are others that really feels like the author was just filling out pages. There are characters that have nothing to do with the plot, but have 30 pages about them. As most classics that I have read, the general plot is awesome, but don't expect all the book to keep you awake. There are parts where you will need real will power to keep going, so just be patient, and continue reading.
B00005QGAT|5.0|While Thriller was the most important album the world had ever experienced, to Michael, this was his most important albu that he'd ever recorded. Although Thriller was unarguably more popular than Off The Wall, or any other album in history for that matter, this album classified as a true solo superstar. Although he'd made previous albums before this one, all of Michael's best and most popular were within the confines of the Jackson 5, and Michael had too many good ideas to hold them inside. While albums like Music and Me were an interesting departure for the younger Michael, they weren't prime material. Off The Wall definitely is prime material on all levels, and it really showcases Michael's talent.<BR>However, all of the credit on this album can't go to Michael. While he is definitely the driving forces behind this album, there are numerous production credits from music legends Paul McCartney, Rod Temperton, Stevie Wonder, and the mastermaker of all modern music, Quincy Jones. They help to bring Michael's album together, and with everything in the right placem Off The Wall is one of the best albums ever in history. Song highlights include Rock With You and Don't Stop'til You Get Enough.

0385504209|1.0|Don't be fooled as I was. I thought I was buying a regular thriller. What I really got was a BLATANT attempt to convert me to paganism--i.e., goddess worship. It should have been titled Paganism 101, because that is really the intent here. I was \\"treated\\" to lecture after lecture on how wonderful goddess worship is, and how it exists everywhere you look, and how unreliable the Bible is.  Did you know that Constantine rewrote the Bible, that God has a female consort (named Shekinah), that Jesus got married and had kids with Mary Magdalene, and that the Israelites had (approved) sex rituals just like the pagans around them? Those are just some of the WILD accusations of this book, and none, absolutely none, have a shred of proof to back them up. The professor character throws those things out there, and the other characters just nod their heads and believe it. Any attempt at objection is a mere lob, a marshmallow designed for the professor to swat out of the park. The writer is depending on the force of the narrative to carry you along so you don't notice the proselytizing, the logical fallacies and especially the lack of proof. And speaking of narrative, don't believe the hype; the writing style is very run-of-the-mill.  In short, this is a great book...to STAY AWAY FROM.
B00005JL0I|3.0|Charles Feldman's Casino Royale is a colorful psychedelic mess 36 years after its creation. This film was the first James Bond spoof and a precurser of the Austin Powers movies. Unfortunately the film has not aged well.<br />The jokes seem as dated as the costumes. There is virtually no plot to speak of and the sequences by four directors seem cobbled together by fifth director Val Guest. <br />The film is fun to watch with its great musical score and vibrant colors but there isn't a lot holding this thing together.<br />Perhaps the most interesting feature of the disc is the 1954 TV movie from Climax Mystery Theatre which featured Barry Nelson as the American spy Jimmy Bond. It was fun to see the true origin of the Bond franchise.<br />Bottom line rent it for its place in history but don't go in expecting greatness.

0385336942|5.0|I loved this book.  It was haunting and moving, while at the same time telling a fascinating and exciting story from our country's wartime past.  It's clear that the writer very thoroughly researched many elements of the novel, including its setting, Alaska, and the audacious attempt by Japan to float bombs to U.S. soil.  But Callanan knows another subject even more intimately -- the human heart.

0385504209|2.0|I give it 2 stars because I actually finished it.  With a final sigh of relief I turned the last page and closed the book for the last time.<br />Plot holes, cheap tricks of suspense, wooden characters. You name it--the logic is faulty and sometimes downright weird. Oh, and let's not forget the author's not so hidden agenda with which he likes to wack the audience upside the head excruciatingly about every page or so.<br />This is a strange theological and semi-historical exploration thinly disguised as fiction.  Brings to mind &quot;The Celestine Prophesy&quot; another new age book that, to the credit of &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;  I was not actually able to stomache long enough to finish.  But it was a best seller too.  Go figure.
B0000524CY|5.0|A highly original & grotesquely disturbing film that makes the unbelievable subject of demonic possession believable.<br /><br />For the very few of you who haven't got a clue as to what this movie is about, it goes something like this. Regan (Linda Blair), the sweet & lovable daughter of a famous actress (Ellen Burstyn) is suddenly struck down with a rare, cerebral disorder- or so it seems. What's really happening to this poor girl is far worse. Satan has decided to leave his cumfy lodgings in hell and take residence inside Regan's body. The demon takes total control of Regan transforming her from a sweet 12 year old girl into a violent, cussing, vile spewing creature with a bad temper and who likes to do bad things with holy relics. A young, troubled priest (Jason Miller) and an older, more experienced priest (Max Von Sydow) are called in to exorcise the demon.<br /><br />The film, when released, was controversial. People in the audience reportedly screamed, fainted and vomited when presented with the film's grisly spectacle. Many of today's younger audience may not fully understand as to why so many reacted to such an extent considering they are all use to seeing violence at a far more graphic level. I guess back in 1973, film's of this nature were not as common and this does not mean \\"The Exorcist\\" will not shock today's generation. Many are still disturbed by its graphic depiction of demonic possession and seeing a small child's physical and emotional slide into torment . One of the reasons this film remains shocking may be because we are not use to seeing 12 year old's behave in the manner depicted in this film. It's shocking indeed to have a 12 year old girl yell out derogatory swear words. The scene depicting Regan's sexual assault, although brief, is still very hard to sit through. Another frightening aspect of the film is the extremely well done make-up effects. Regan's face, in the final stages of her possession is unsettling. Her face becomes scarred and mutilated, her lips, chapped and her eyes, pasty and colourless. It's very easy for the viewer to forget that they are looking at a very young girl. But as frightening as the visuals are, in my opinion the most disturbing aspect of the film is the sound effects. The demonic voices which emanate from the child's mouth are unsettling. At times, the voice is deep and masculine. At other times it's more feminine and raspy, sounding very much like an evil hag and there is one instance when we hear several overlapping voices giving us the impression that Regan is possessed by more than one demon. The star of the vocal effects is Mercedes McCambridge and she must be credited for the incredible work she did in the film.<br /><br />Also impressive are the performances from the cast, many whom received Oscar nominations. Despite the material, they pull off their roles successfully, never resorting to over-acting and the characters are given an emotional depth and human element that is rare in horror pictures, at least the horror films of today. We feel for every single character in this film - the guilt-ridden Father Karras, Father Merrin, who despite his old age, tackles on the difficult challenge in trying to exorcise this little girl, the tormented Chris McNeil and the victim of possession herself - Regan.<br /><br />\\"The Exorcist\\" is definitely not for everyone as many will find the subject matter far-fetched and the contents offensive. But for those wanting to experience the ultimate in first-class horror, it will not disappoint. It's revolting, distasteful & crude. Everything you'd expect from a first rate and unforgettable horror masterpiece.mutilated, her lips, chapped and her eyes, pasty and colourless.

B0000TB05A|4.0|Everything about the intensity of this show is incredible!!  If you haven't bought a U2 DVD yet, buy this one.   You will not be disappointed!<br />The only gripe I have about the entire DVD is the fact that it concentrates just a bit much on the most recent studio effort.  Don't get me wrong, it's great!  It's just that many, many other U2 songs are fabulous as well.  I have not seen a U2 show since the Achtung Baby tour, so I cannot comment on whether this was an edited version of the complete show, but I would have loved to hear lots more -- U2, please make a double DVD set next time!<br />Bring on offbeat songs like Zooropa, or some of their better covers, like the Beatles' Help!... More, please!
B000001FSR|4.0|First of all I would like to state that I love Tom Waits and have been listening to him non-stop for two months I own eleven of his CDs. The trilogy of Swordfishtrombones/Raindogs/Frank's Wild Years has been the hardest CDs for me to get into (Bone Machine was a natural). Alice is another difficult one. I think it is the carnival-barker-talking styles many of the songs incorporate. In defense of this work I must admit that the production and concept are very impressive. Some of Tom's  best work is on this CD in particular \\"Hang on St. Christopher, Temptation, Yesterday is Here, Way Down in the Hole, Cold Cold Ground, and Train Song\\". Just a note Tom's vocals on \\"Train Song\\" are so stirring. You can hear the pain so clearly. He sounds like he is crying as he sings this song. For those people that have heard a little of Tom's work and think that Tom can't sing you need a hearing aid. His voice is extremely versatile and beautiful (listen to \\"On the Nickle\\"/Heartattack and Vine, \\"Kentucky Avenue\\" and \\"Blue Valentine\\"/Blue Valentine, \\"Tom's Traubert's Blues\\"/Small Change, \\"Come on up to the House\\"/Mule Variations as well as \\"Train Song\\" just to name a few. When I want to get really freaked out I listen to Closing Time and The Heart of Saturday Night. Love the CDs but  wish he had changed his singing style prior to their release. <br />So in conclusion I would have to disagree with some of the reviewers that state that this should be a starting point in order to discover Tom's work. I think Blue Valentine, or Heartattack and Vine might be better. Of course you could start with Closing Time or Heart of Saturday Night but beware Tom blows these works out of the water with his later releases.  <br />I would also like to ask people reading this review to help me in my quest to discover other artist as good (if that is possible) as Tom. I have been a big fan of Dylan, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell and Cohen for a long time. Is there anymore artist out there that can hold up to this group? Email me klott@travelersoasis.com. Thanks and thank you Tom for I am a raindog too.
B00008DDXB|5.0|I had accidentally stumbled upon the first Harry Potter (Sorceror's Stone) a few weeks ago on TV.  My daughters (4yrs & 5yrs old) & I were entranced by the movie and anxious to watch the next in the series!  We were not dissappointed!<br /><br />All the main characters are back at Hogwarts; Harry, Hermoine & Ron, along with plenty of new ones. Watching the 50 year old mystery of 'The Chamber' evolve was pure entertainment and the culprit a surprise! The special effects were too believable for this arachnophobiac!!-but great!!  (The spiders were almost too much for my 5 yr old, but didn't deter her from watching to the end!) The Chamber of Secrets kept us glued to the set!<br /><br />I'm not one to give away the story...so I'll stop there.<br /><br />I don't recommend letting children who are nightmare prone watch, but my 4 & 5 yr old enjoyed it without a problem.  I recommend this movie without hesitation!<br /><br />1smileycat :-)
B000063DGC|5.0|Randy Rhoads is totally amazing on this album. Any music fan will enjoy this album, it shows this man's true talent. The Mr. Crowley solos are totally amazing, just hear how smoothly he plays these solos. The Tribute live version of all these songs are a lot better than the studio version. A piece of musical history and a must buy for any music fan.
B00005V9HH|3.0|You have a chance to see many of your fave actors, obviously having a good time with this romp.  The movie is tongue in cheek and asks that you suspend disbelief.  Do si, and enjoy the suspense instead!
B0000AQVCL|3.0|My brother, who keeps up with all the latest musical trends, developments, etc., highly recommended this album to me.  He described it as a blend of AC/DC, Oasis, and retro-hard rock.  An appealing possibility, yes?  Well, Jet is on target half of the time.  When the band kicks into gear with it's hard as nails guitar riffs, serpentine bass lines and walloping drums, you start allowing yourself the faint hope that their searing sound will cut through the sludge of Pearl Jam clones and Hip Hop trash peddlers masquerading as talented musicians.  Jet, unfortunately, is not so sure handed with their ballads.  Mundane, indistinguished, and a bit mewling in tone without a hook in sight.  A lot of promise here, as evidenced by the rockers. A bit more work to do as indicated by the forgettable slow stuff.  If they learn anything, their next release should be a scorcher.
B0000013G9|5.0|One of the best Cd's I know.<BR>Good songs mixed with this special TLC style.<BR>This will forever be their best Album.
B00008CLOA|5.0|Having been a Floyd fan for years, I thought I had heard it all.<br />I don't need to tell you what an amazing album DSOTM is.  It's been said a million times before.<br />If you are a Floyd fan, or an audiophile, or both, and you own an SACD player: You owe it to yourself to get this edition of one of the greatest albums of all time.  With the right system, you can close your eyes and feel like you can reach out and touch the band.  They might as well be playing right there in your living room.  The album comes alive like never before.  Definite kudos to the sound engineering team who remastered the 16-track recordings and created the 5.1 surround sound mix.  It's simply mind blowing.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I just saw Lost in Translation on DVD. This movie defines the word \\"overrated\\". What a boring movie! I actually dosed off for a few minutes. I went back to see what I missed. It didn't matter. Boring characters, boring script, boring movie!!! I can't believe it was nominated for best picture while good films were passed over. I can't see how anyone can call this a great movie, unless understated and boring is now considered greatness. I write screenplays and one of the cardinal rules of screenwriting is \\"don't bore your audience\\".
B00005JMJ4|5.0|So you read the reviews from luke warm to glowing, and back to shamefully bashing.  And it is a little more then confusing.  The answers are simple:<br />Sofia Coppola has made an incredible love movie for the new millenium that doesn't pander to very contemorary cliche, involve sex (well, almost) or deal with accepted romance standards.  And what she made was something more fluid and romantic then anything I've seen for years in movies.  While this movie isn't a vast, complicated plot or filled with actiony sequences utilizing amazing effects, it does what any film has to in order to succeed- tell a story that can involve an audience.<br />Kudos to all involved.  It is a stunningly accurate, and obviously live, version of Tokyo.  Being there twice, I can relate to the sounds, the people, the design, and anything in this great visual ode to one of the most amazing cities in the world.  Having studied Japanese for the last 18 months, I can understand some of the dialogues and understand why the east and west has such a gap that could create this relationship/story.  Most amazing is the small detail of the 'Dr. Who Sci Fi' hum of machinery within cooridors and buildings that masks a constant noise of choatic human activity just beyond the walls of any room.  And more evidently, the story of miscommunication and alienation within a world in your face, yet emotionally beyond your reach is relayed brilliantly.<br />This film will grow with the Japophile, and be a sweet romance to anyone unfamiliar with the idea of being segregated within a society they can't relate to.  But, it will keep me thinking because of the sweet relations between the two lead characters as they find and lose the loves of their life within the confines of Tokyo.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Amidst all of the big Hollywood blockbusters late last year, there premiered a small, quiet little film that nearly blew all other films out of the water. Now, as Oscar season rolls around, there seems to be great emphasis on this film and deservedly so. &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; was one of the best films released last year, and quite possibly, over the course of several years.<br />The plot initially seems bland or blase; a washed-up movie star visits Tokyo to do a liquor commercial, and meets an attractive girl in a bar. So what makes this film so special?<br />First, the talent of Bill Murray.  Murray simply steals this movie and makes it his own. As Bill Harris, Murray drips sadness, bewilderment, and approachibility with every scene. He somehow drops his comic guard and allows us in, living with him this incredible foreign experience. We are with him every step of the way, and understand him totally. Adding to the mixture is the beautiful Scarlett Johansson, who mirrors Murray's performance perfectly. The two leads could not have been better suited for these roles.<br />Second, the script rocks. Both characters at different times in their lives ooze a loneliness that's brought out in the hustle and bustle of modern day Japan. They reach out to each other in thier loneliness, in an attempt to make human contact with another like soul. Although both characters are married, it's never threatening, and you come to understand their motives. All of this is emphasized with the second theme running through the movie, a fish out of water in the country of Japan. The results are both hilarious and introspective, and perfect.<br />But what really makes this movie shine is the many, many, many moments of perfect quietness that speak essential truths. The lonely sound of bells ringing as Murray stands heads above each person in the elevator. The underwater exercise class. Charlotte walking across the pond on circular stones. Bill sitting alone in the bar. Charlotte being pulled into a flower arranging class. You may appreciate one or two of these moments, but this film is loaded with them. They allow this film to breathe; breathe life into the plot, the characters, and breathe life into ourselves.<br />Lost in Translation is a remarkable film from a remarkable first time director. If you haven't seen it, rent or buy in now. You simple won't regret this decision.eing pulled into a flower arranging class.

B00005JM0B|2.0|I loved the Terminator series growing up, so imagine my disappointment at this movie. Yes, it has all the action one could want, but the problem is it's all action and hardly any story. The one change I did like was the casting of Nick Stahl as John Connor. He was a definite improvement over whiny Eddie Furlong. I miss Linda Hamilton and miss the actual emphasis on the action furthering the story. This movie is just about action furthering the studio's pocketbook.
B000001ELD|5.0|I have my second roommate at NMSU, Deon Arteaga, to thank for pushing me more into KISS's music, and Gene Simmons' solo album was one of the selections he had (among others).  I was expecting something that went beyond the boundaries of KISS's c-ck rock, say what he would actually do to Christine Sixteen, but no, the Demon displayed a conventional but eclectic mix of music as well as many guest stars.  Among the backing vocalists is Katey Segal, later of Married With Children fame, and producer Sean Delaney.<br />&quot;Radioactive&quot; is the most KISS-like song, easily fitting on either the debut album or Love Gun, but it's got too much of that early 70's (read classic rock) sound.  Radioactive is definitely one way to describe a real hot woman, but beware that radiation!  Bob Seger and Aerosmith's Joe Perry help out.<br />&quot;Burning Up With Fever&quot; starts with a nice guitar played in a kind of Oriental style, before going into rock mode.  One of the backing vocalist here is Donna Summer, also a Casablanca Records alumnus like KISS back then.<br />&quot;See You Tonite&quot; is one of a few songs with a Beatles influence, say a mid-tempo version of their Help! period, maybe even pre-Hard Day's Night era and it's a mid-tempo number with symphonic arrangements, courtesy of members of the NY and LA Philharmonics.<br />Per the innuendo &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot; means what it says, especially with the &quot;you are the lock I am the key&quot; line, meaning that the demon hasn't lost his satyr-like aspects.  Joe Perry contributes here.<br />&quot;True Confessions&quot; has a slowed down 60's-type soul/pop with a melange of backing vocalists, Helen &quot;I Am Woman&quot; Reddy, the Azusa Citrus College Choir (my favourite part of the song), and a piano boogie.<br />&quot;Living In Sin&quot; shows the tried and true demon KISS fans know.  Bob Seger and Cher guest here.  The soul piano and backing vocalists again make this a quick soulful number that could easily fit on Peter Criss's album, except that the electric guitar adds a rock dimension not too present on the Criss one, and Peter wouldn't have a woman going into fast-talking hysteria and then gasping in ecstasy while talking to him on the phone.<br />&quot;Man of 1,000 Faces&quot; is an ode to the James Cagney movie about silent movie star Lon Chaney, whose myriad disguises gave him that monicker.  The symphonic arrangements are present here.<br />Probably my favourite mellow song is &quot;Mr. Make Believe&quot; as it too has a Beatles influence, Rubber Soul era, maybe earlier, but with Phil Spector's symphonic wall of sound.<br />Of the KISS members, Gene's the only one to reprise a KISS song, and he takes Rock And Roll Over's &quot;See You In Your Dreams&quot; with the backing section of female singers making a difference.<br />That segues into a cover of the schmaltzy Walt Disney standard &quot;When You Wish Upon A Star&quot;, the last song I'd expect him to cover.<br />The number of soft songs is amazing for the demon, whose human side comes out, and it's those I like more.  And the more rocking numbers fit more into conventional 70's rock than the glam metal familiar to KISS, so proving that he could do more than sing about his conquests or rock and roll, displayed his creativity and diverse influences.  For that reason, Gene Simmons' solo album ties for second with Ace's.t on Peter Criss's album, except that the electric guitar adds a rock dimension not too present on the Criss one, and Peter wouldn't have a woman going into fast-talking hysteria and then gasping in ecstasy while talking to him on the phone.<br />&quot;Man of 1,000 Faces&quot; is an ode to the James Cagney movie about silent movie star Lon Chaney, whose myriad disguises gave him that monicker.

B00000I07Q|4.0|NEW JERSEY is Bon Jovi's second megahit following SLIPPERY WHEN WET(the band's first megahit) released in 1986. Two years later,this album brought big hits such as BAD MEDICINE,LAY YOUR HANDS ON ME,I'LL BE THERE FOR YOU,LIVING IN SIN and BORN TO BE MY BABY(the latter two were not recycled for the CROSSROAD compilation). RIDE COWBOY RIDE was recorded in mono. That's because the song was originally recorded on a monaural cassette recorder. All the other songs are good. NEW JERSEY is where all 5 Bon Jovi members hail from. In fact,I'm a NEW JERSEY native myself. Two years after this album was released,frontman Jon Bon Jovi(Bongiovi) recorded and released BLAZE OF GLORY for the movie &quot;Young Guns II&quot;. That song would appear on the CROSSROAD compilation released in 1994. The group would release their next album KEEP THE FAITH in 1992,which was not a big hit like NEW JERSEY and SLIPPERY WHEN WET.
B00013PHGS|3.0|I won't even go about the music which is OK but the freaking copy protection prevents the disc from being played on my computer. If Air and other artists want to be alienated in this way by lining behind the record labels then it is fine but this is the first AND last copy controlled disc I buy. And this is from someone that foolishly shelves the cash for legal software instead of downloading/borrowing/ripping/stealing/whatever they want to call it.
B00011RPB0|3.0|What happens when a married, fading, American movie star named Bob Harris (Bill Murray) goes to Tokyo to film whiskey commercials and meets a married soul-searching, jobless, Yale philosophy graduate named Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson)?<br />\\"Lost in Translation\\" plays out this scenario by building on subtle tensions.  An early sequence of scenes builds up several relationship slaps between Charlotte and her husband of two years.  For example, he forgets to introduce her to a bouncy blonde old friend he runs into in the hotel lobby.  With her husband constantly away on a rock-band photo shoot, Charlotte is established as unhappily married and lonely in Tokyo.  Bob Harris is established as lonely in Tokyo as he goes through the semi-humiliation of being a famous American in Japan.  He finds himself in comic situations best illustrated by the scene where a complimentary prostitute comes to his room and wants him to \\"lip\\"-or was it \\"rip\\"-her stockings.  When Harris gets a note that he forgot his son's birthday, his sleepless nights and dedication to his seat at the hotel bar are colored by problems in a 25 year marriage.<br />When Bob and Charlotte meet, the movie takes on the feel of a summer vacation romance between the unhappily married.  As the young Charlotte asks Bob questions about life and displays quiet, girlish admiration for Bob's witty comments, a new dimension of tension develops as we wonder if this is the development of romantic love or father/daughter love.<br />This is a slow, moody movie that can only keep the viewer interested through subtle tensions set against a back-drop that shows interesting, comic, beautiful, and weird perspectives on Tokyo culture.
B000006TRV|5.0|The Wall is one of the greatest albums of all time, all the other reviews can demonstrate that. I just want to inform people looking for more amazing music similar to the Wall to check out a recent discovery I made. <BR>Modest Mouse- The Moon and Antarctica<BR>Its a loose concept album with a vocalist that does everything, inventive guitar work, and just flat out great song writing. If you love the Wall, you will want to check this album out. I highly reccomend this even if you aren't an indie rock fan.
0385510438|4.0|Here we are back in Ford county mississippi in 1970 in the town of Clanton the type of small town where you have the courthouse downtown with most of the businesses in the general (like a plaza) the type of town where a friday night football game is on the verged of being a religon and where all the local politics and local gossip is discussed in the diner or cafe.The local newspaper The Ford County Times through mismanagment and the fact that the editior main focus is on the obitituaries has gone into bankruptcy.Much to the dismay of the locals the paper is bought by a 23 year old willie traynor who has spent 5 years at syracuse univerisity and does not have much direction until his grandmother who was providing the funding cuts him off and tells him to find a job.The town folks do not take kindly to a socalled northerner or yankee.<br />As willie gets settled he starts to get the papered turned around and starts to get a following and gets his big break for increased paper circulation with his coverage of the brutual rape and murder of Rhoda Kassellaw by Danny Padgitt who is from a prominent family who made money form legal and illegal activities who had the money and influence that swayed elections  and court cases.<BR> As the book moves forward and the case against danny goes to court many feel that the power of the Padgitts will come to play but surprisingly danny is convicted.While the trial is going on Danny tells the jury that if they find him guilty that he will get payback on everyone of them.Because of the messeed up court and parole system even though he was sentenced to life he serves nine years and plots his revenge<br />I thought this was a pretty good book seems that grisham is changing direction of some his books wish he would go back to books like pelican brief and the firm.
1573228737|5.0|Without going into a lot of detail, I just feel the need to express how wonderfully written and suspensful this was.  It seemed to take a little while to get to the action, but every page and description is necessary to draw you ever deeper into the story and for the characters to become fully developed.  The ending will mesmerize you and while the twist is not wholly unpredictable, it is the passion with which it is told that will move you.  Give it a try!
0446310786|5.0|I read &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; when I was 16 for my GCSE exams in England. Then, I liked it, but I wonder how much of that was my teacher's opinion, not mine. My sister is approaching 16 now, and apparently about to start studying it, so I said I would re-read it to see if I could help her with it at all. My mum re-read it too, so we could compare notes.<br />In a way, I wish I hadn't read it when I was 16: I wonder whether putting this book on a syllabus for 16 year olds is a mistake. Harper Lee, after all, never intended the book to be studied by children.<br />I couldn't put it down this time. I was at that stage where you almost remember what happens, but don't quite, so the story is just as engrossing the second time. This time, I was struck by the mockingbird analogy more than ever. It is a beautiful metaphor and actually applies to many of the characters in the book: not just Boo Radley, but Tom Robinson and Jem too. When you think about that the whole way through, it gives the book a whole new depth and meaning that is not immediately evident on the surface. I think before, when I read the line &quot;it's a sin to kill a mockingbird&quot; I fell into that trap of thinking &quot;oh good, that's the title of the book mentioned at last&quot;. It's easy to attribute the metaphor solely to Boo Radley because of Scout's (very insightful) comment at the end of the book &quot;it'd be kinda like shooting a mockingbird,wouldn't it?&quot;, but I think that is just scratching the surface of this wonderfully written novel. I hope every 16 year old reading &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; has a wonderful teacher willing to give them everything it has to offer.<br />Highly recommended.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This movie was such a good movie, i wrote about it for a college class last semester. Here are some excerpts from my paper.<br />&quot;Lost in Translation is a movie not intended for the masses. It does not have 15 minute car chases, or handsome Hollywood hunks.  It has real characters, with real problems that find themselves in a strange place. Lost in Translation captures a feeling lost in many movies today, loneliness. Movies should not always have a story book ending, because that is not the way life really is.  Loneliness is a constant theme throughout this movie, but it is expressed in many different ways.&quot;<br />&quot;When Bob calls home, it is as cordial as a conversation with a telemarketer. He will say \\"I love you\\" after his wife hangs up. It appears as if the love is gone in his relationship with his wife. He seems very depressed. He drowns his pain in an ever-present glass of whiskey.&quot;<br />&quot;Movies are meant to give you an escape from reality. Sometimes a good bloody movie is just the cure for a bland week at school. This movie is not an escape from reality. The only escape is into the glowing lights of Tokyo.  This movie probably plays out for people everyday.  It somehow finds a way to be entertaining. It is defiantly not a movie for the masses. Some people would find it very difficult to sit through this movie. This is real life though, and it is interesting. The feelings this movie will give you are indescribable. You will feel for Bob when he is on the phone with his wife. You will feel for Charlotte when she realizes she faces a daunting task in front of her, staying married. Your emotions will be tugged upon during the ending. These characters both are lonely without each other. Millions of questions go unanswered in this movie, but that is what makes it so good. It is not the classic happy ending. If a happy ending is what you want, Go see Finding Nemo. For a great movie, with great actors and a great story, check out Lost in Translation. It is a movie that deals with very real problems we face everyday. Loneliness is present in everyone's life. This movie breaks the mold of Hollywood movies. Lost in Translation is a movie about life. Life is not perfect but it is still worth living&quot;
B00008S2VG|5.0|I have been a Madonna fan for almost 20 years now and she never fails to impress me.<br />Ok, so she has made some errors along the way but with a 20 year career you would expect that!<br />Bottom Line - American Life is superb!! I cannot understand why so many people especially her fans hate it so much. There are some GREAT songs on this album.<br />Amazing melodies and a real sense that Madonna is singing about issues that really mean something to her.<br />I urge anybody to listen before judging!! You WON'T be disapointed.
B00004Z459|5.0|this CD  is juss plain great. it has some rap and mostly rock on it.

0671027344|5.0|Possibly the best book I've ever read, The Perks of Being a Wallflower captures exactly what it is to be a teenager. The story itself is raw, Charlie one of the most honest characters I've come across in years. It is my belief that this book outdoes any other coming-of-age story I've ever read, even in its comparison to Catcher in the Rye. Perks is an insightful and vivid journey through the life of a high school freshman, and although people may think, 'There is no way a fifteen year old thinks that way,' there is. With the exception of Salinger, it was hard for me to imagine anyone truly understanding what it is to be a teenager unless they themselves are one, until I read this book. Chbosky has done a wonderful job, this book has changed the way I think and see the world - possibly my life - just in reading it. I love it! Let me also say thanks to the other reviewer who recommended The Losers Club by Richard Perez -- another good one.
B00006D295|5.0|If you want to see this film, see it first in a theater where audience participation is a must.  Then buy the movie!  The gothic nature of the film creates a comical balance with the all-american-sweethearts (played by Susan Sarandon and Barry Boswick), when a predictable flat tire brings together the characters of the Rocky Horror Picture Show. During the course of one night innocence is lost, sensuality runs amuck, and the dark humor never ends.  From the moment Tim Curry appears in the movie, I knew I would be a fan for life.  Meatloaf also has his brief moment to shine in this dark comedy.  There is a narrator, so no viewers can loose site of the plot, and some lively costume undressing.  There is a sci-fi undertone, several sloppy choreographed scenes (which play terribly well in this gothic toned movie), and even a dance you are sure to learn and use at your next theater viewing to impress friends that are virgins to the knowledge of this film.  <BR>On my second visit to a theater showing, I was fortunate enough to win a collectors item poster of the film.  Though this was the icing on the cake, I later found that my enthusiasm for the Rocky Horror Picture Show was shared with many, making this movie a cult classic.  <BR>If you like this film, I reccommend Velvet Goldmine, Hedwig and the Angry Inch, and Trainspotting.
B00005K3OT|4.0|For those who saw this movie as anti-Christian, I say rubbish!  Those people are just as close-minded as the townspeople in the movie.  It is much more about old-fashioned, sad, and narrow-minded people learning about happiness, tolerance, and acceptance of the differences in people.  Chocolat is a magical, enchanting film.  The characters and the actors who play them are wonderful.  If you are a Johhny Depp fan, you may be disappointed that his part is actually quite small, but he is positively gorgeous and perfect in this character.
B000002H97|5.0|This is just a flat out awesome album nobody can deny that. Clear standouts obviously are ENTER SANDMAN, SAD BUT TRUE, UNFORGIVEN, NOTHING ELSE MATTERS, WHEREVER I MAY ROAM, OF WOLF &amp; MAN, look at that thats 6 epic songs on 1 ALBUM! whats that saying about the album? Tallica fans who say there over this album are full of S#@T.
0872860175|5.0|In 'Howl and Other Poems' Allen Ginsburg plumbs the depths of primal human emotion from the perspective of the disenfranchised bohemians of 1950s urban America. With haunting phrases and cadences influenced by sources as disparate as Hebrew liturgy and ad copy, Ginsburg evokes the joy and despair of a affluent Post-World-War-II decade lived in the shadow of the Bomb and Eisenhower's grim military-industrial complex. 'Beat' writing is a unique, experimental genre which transcends the strictures of contemporary academic style and content, dealing forthrightly with drug abuse, homosexuality, and other taboo subjects of the time. Allen Ginsburg and his creative associates were the stellar grass-roots poets of their generation, and deserve a careful reading both for enjoyment and understanding of an important time of transition in American society. Buy this book! I'd also like to thank the reviewer who mentioned The Losers Club by Richard Perez, about a poet in New York's East Village. Another great Amazon pick!
0679428895|4.0|Harris begins his historical thriller on August 22, A.D. 79,two days before Mount Vesuvius will erupt, burying the city of Pompeii and devastating the landscape around the Bay of Naples.Much of the dramatic tension arises because while none of the characters are aware of their impending doom, readers know what's coming.<BR>The unlikely hero is Marcus Attilius, an earnest young engineer from Rome who has been put in charge of the Aqua Augusta, the massive aqueduct that provides water to the Roman colonies around the bay. There's trouble with the aqueduct, but even before Attilius can find the problem complications arise. His predecessor has mysteriously disappeared and his men are surly and rebellious.The corruptness of the world he finds himself in is personified by the millionaire Ampliatus, a former slave who having gained his freedom, used it to make a fortune capitalizing on the greed of the wealthy Romans who have settled in this part of the world.But Ampliatus is also the father of a beautiful and rebellious daughter, Corelia Ampliata, who, needless to say, catches Attilius' eye and plays a major role in the ensuing drama.<BR>Harris provides a detailed picture of this world, which I enjoyed, although some readers may find it too contrived, too like a period room in a museum.  I was also fascinated by his description of the aqueduct, its construction and its importance to Pompeii and the other settlements in Italy. Without water,he suggests, there could be no civilization.<BR>The action moves swiftly to Pompeii, where Attilius confronts Ampliatus and the Board of Four, the corrupt magistrates who have developed the city with no regard for the volcano's destructive history. Determined, he sets off for the slopes of Vesuvius to repair the aqueduct in the final hours before the eruption in a breathtaking race with time. Suffice it to say that the suspense increases as the inevitable catastrophe comes closer. And when Vesuvius finally explodes, readers will feel they too are fleeing through the streets of Pompeii.<BR>As suggested, some readers will no doubt find that Harris' historical material overwhelms the story. I, however, was convinced by it, and still enjoyed the story. While not a great writer, Harris knows his stuff.
B0000DZ3IG|4.0|I am partial to English romantic comedies with Hugh Grant in them.  Needless to say, I thought Love Actually was the best movie ever and saw it three times in theaters.  Cannot wait till the DVD comes out...<br />The soundtrack is equally good with an excellent mix of oldies and goodies from the movie.  I especially like the re-do of Mariah's &quot;All I Want for Christmas&quot; and the inclusion of some of the best Maroon 5 songs from their CD &quot;Songs About Jane.&quot;  <br />If you want a good mix CD, pick this one up and I don't think you will be disappointed.
B000002BFZ|5.0|It seems like millions of fans were let down with this Pearl Jam album, and I suppose it's easy to understand why.  This album is much more mellow and experimental and less radio friendly on the whole.  Maybe people wanted songs they could enjoy right away, and not an album that would sink in and unfold itself over time.  That's exactly what \\"No Code\\" is.  I didn't like it so much at first, but now I think it's amazing.  I think this is some of Pearl Jam's best work, call me crazy.  Let's go through it.  <br />\\"Sometimes\\" is a mellow, muted guitar riff that builds up slightly.  It may sound weird the first time you hear it, but this song is beautiful, in the strangest way.  \\"Hail, Hail\\" is a great rocker.  \\"Who You Are\\" has some gorgeous vocal harmonies and awesome drumming (by Jack Irons, former Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer).  \\"In My Tree\\" is not one of my favorites, but it's often in their concert setlists.  \\"Smile\\", as others have pointed out, is influenced by Neil Young.  A good rocker.  \\"Off He Goes\\" is one of my favorites, a pretty acoustic song.  \\"Habit\\", \\"Red Mosquito\\" \\"Mankind\\" (sung by Stone Gossard\\" and \\"Lukin\\" are all great rockers, the last one being my favorite, a full minute of screaming and 3 power chords, awesomeness.  \\"Present Tense\\" is a ballad with an amazing vocal performance from Ed, and lyrics that are simple, yet inspiring.  \\"I'm Open\\" wouldn't really stand on it's own, but in the context of the album, I find it to be a pretty interlude.  \\"Around The Bend\\" is a laid-back, acoustic song.  It's a pretty closer for the album.  <br />A lot of people here have complained that Mike McCready isn't on this album as much.  Not true.  No long solos like \\"Alive\\", but there's plenty of leads and textures added by him that add to the overall atmosphere of the album.  It definitely couldn't have been achieved without him.  Eddie Vedder wrote most of the material for this album, but the whole band is essential for producing it's sound.  The new drummer, Jack Irons, is quite good on this album.  Much more interesting than Matt Cameron, but that's just my opinion (I think Matt was amazing with Soundgarden, but as fitting in Pearl Jam, but that's a different story.)<br />The amazon review for this album says that it holds up well start to finish, and I couldn't agree more.  This isn't an album you put on when you want the fairly simple hard-rock of \\"Ten\\" (I love that album, btw).  It's one you put on when you want to really listen to the album from start to finish.  It's different, but it's quite good.  Highly recommended.
B00012QM8G|5.0|For the first time in nearly 100 Amazon reviews, I am giving a product a five-star rating while more or less suggesting that it may not be worth buying.<br />The thought occurred to me just after my heart jumped a bit upon realizing that Schindler's List was about to be released in DVD, something that has been a long time coming.<br />This is a rare example of a film that met with great commercial success and well-deserved critical acclaim, and it may be the film that hugely talented and prolific director Steven Spielberg will be remembered for. This is one of the greatest motion pictures ever made, and when I started building my DVD collection a few years ago I always considered the film's absence a glaring one.<br />But now that now that I can finally add it to the collection, I wondered: do we buy DVDs of great films, or of films we want to watch again and again? If the answer is the former, Schindler's List is a perfect fit. But it it's the latter -- and I think it is -- then I am not so sure.<br />This is not the kind of film one can watch without becoming involved, and involved in a profound way. It is important and difficult and uncomfortable and a masterpiece of modern cinema -- but is not enjoyable. Can anyone who has seen this film imagine watching it again to pass the time on a rainy night? Is it the motion picture you'd select to watch after ordering out for pizza when friends stop by? Not from my perspective, and that is why this great film won't soon be on the shelf with the rest of my DVDs.

B00006879E|5.0|Maroon 5 has to be one of the best bands of 2003.  &quot;Songs about Jane&quot; is the perfect mix of R&amp;B and rock and their sound is refreshing and new.  <br />The CD has a good mix of 'chill' and 'up-beat' songs which makes it perfect for long rides and I sometimes even pop it in at the gym.  The lead singer's voice is like honey and I cannot wait to see them in concert the next time they tour.  <br />Seriously, this is one of the best CD's of 2003 and if you don't purchase it, in a few years, you will regret it.
B00008PW2E|5.0|SIX FEET UNDER IS INDEED AND EXCELLENT SHOW.  HOWEVER, PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO DO NOT WANT TO PAY HBO ON CABLE JUST TO WATCH ONE SHOW ARE BOUND TO WATCH THEM ON DVD.  HBO SHOULD GET THESE ON DVD TO AVOID PEOPLE FROM DOWNLOADING IT FROM THE INTERNET.  ME, PERSONALLY, WOULD PREFFER TO OWN MY OWN COPY OF SEASON 2 ON DVD.  -I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL THEY KILL LISA.-
B00005ATZT|5.0|Fans of the original series and those not in the know loved this movie when it came out, seemingly so many years ago.  It sparked a wave of nostalgia for the original series and re-runs of it were constant.<br />While Harrison Ford's persona has become a bit typecast in his recent movies, his take on Dr. Richard Kimble was spot on, channeling David Jansson's (sorry if that's spelled wrong) portrayal to the tee.  Ford took the original character, expanded his &quot;good guy&quot; elements and created a character as memorable as the original.<br />Jansson's Fugitive was a smart man and used his smarts week to week, to face each new crisis.  Ford does this well, stopping to diagnose a sick child and endangering his own freedom by saving a prison gaurd on the bus that was taking him toward his own execution.  At the same time, he maintained his hell-bent determination to prove his innocence. <br />Jansson did &quot;harried&quot; very well in the series and there's one scene in the movie where we see Ford at a distance, walking down a street. Because it's dark and he's a ways away, it almost looks as though Jansson had come back from the dead to do the scene, it's that convincing. <br />This movie has, and will stand up to the test of time because of it's study of character, be it Kimble, or Jones's Girard. A definite must-see.
B000089RVR|5.0|This CD is amazing.  I was a real stickler for the last and bought copies for all my friend's birthdays...but this one surpasses the last in variety of songs and the voice that Dido has developed since her last CD.  <br />She has such a haunting voice that gives one the chills listening to her songs.  She has really worked at getting an original sound and her lyrics have changed in their intensity and passion.  <br />If you liked the first CD, you will certainly LOVE this one.  Any fans of Sarah McLaughlan or Fiona Apple should be sure to pick this one up.
0688145078|5.0|We wanted to prepare our 2 and 1/2 year old for the arrival of his baby sister, so we ordered several books on pregnancy and being a big brother. By far, this was the easiest for him to understand, and is the most requested book in his library. He reminds me all the time that \\"babies like to be warm and cozy\\" and he loves to say that he is \\"special to Mommy and Daddy\\", just like the big brother in the book. While I plan to breastfeed, and the baby in the book is bottle fed, we've simply explained to him that some babies are fed from the breast and others from the bottle. Otherwise, I'd recommend this to anyone looking for an upbeat and simple book for a younger older brother.
B00003CX8N|4.0|The perfect mixture of a movie for people who love books and England.  The writing is superb, such funny witty banter.
B00009V8Z9|4.0|It took a few listens, but it hooked me after about 3 rounds through.  I found myself suddenly humming tunes from this album, and dying to hear them again.  While maybe not THE most original, his music is very catchy and he's got a great voice and interesting lyrics (listen close to the entire meaning, not just a few lines).  This is a great CD for a relaxing drive.
B0000AQVCL|2.0|For anyone who knows anything about the history of rock music, this CD is a sampler. Kinda like a greatest hits package of Rock 'n' Roll that covers every hardrocking band from the last 30 years, mutch to their credit (or discredit), they seem to have pop music ADHD, they can't stay covering one band, they hop from Iggy Pop to ACDC, to Pink Floyd, etc. As opposed to the Strokes or the Vines who freely rip off multiple long since passed bands into one seemless Frankenstien-like creature in EVERY song.<br />For the most part Jet is harmless, they make some catchy tunes that basically cover songs from their heroes and labe it as their own. This is fine so long as their musical chops can keep up with their influences, and as long as they use 'good' influences. Their hit single &quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl&quot; is a dead ringer for Iggy Pop's only real 'hit' &quot;Lust for Life&quot; and just like Iggy's, Jet's song is equally catchy and fun, minus the absolutly filthy lyrics of Pop's gem. The rest of the album is similar in that they all are catch and are all for the most part fun.<br />There however is the problem, its not nessisarily them, but the trend they represent; retro. It seems that theirs nothing good and new under the sun, the whole graverobbing pop thing is fine for a bit, but it sets the precident for a lack of originality. The whole old made new movement is fine as cultural filler, but when the entire New York scene is basically the Strokes, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, etc. then where is the creativity that gave birth to Talking Heads, the Ramones, and Television? (I AM aware that Jet is from Australia).<br />If David Byrne were dead he'd be spinning in his grave, no-one really rips of Talking Heads musically because the important thing about Talking Heads was that they pushed the limits of pop music, and made original music that was good. Its the message of the music that new bands should follow, not the music itself.<br />For anyone not even vaugly familiarwith rock history this album is a treat, its fun, catchy, and minus the filler tracks worth the moeny, but for everyone else, its going to sound VERY familiar. I for one can thank the Strokes for getting me into CBGB's era rock, so for many this may be a stepping stone to get into more  authentic territory.<br />PS Rollover DJ is the worst most hypocritical thing ever written.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly was a treasure. I was stunned by FOX's decision to cancel it. I love this DVD. I would love to see a Firefly movie. But what I realy want is to have this show back on the air. I haven't watched FOX since this show was cancelled.
0394716787|5.0|What an incredible deal. Look at the number of pages for such a low price.<br />Poe captured, better than most, the deepest fears and visions of the human race through profound, elegant words. His personal addictions and tragedies only lent more credibility to the thoughts expressed in his stories.<br />Amazing stuff, indeed.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I had no real expectations when going into the theatre to see this film, having heard only a handful of reviews in the weeks prior. By the end of the movie I found myself comfortably surprised, delighted at the quiet story of two lost souls who find themselves in a place that feels altogether alien. Even in the most quiet of moments, when the camera seems to linger on a scene longer than you might expect, I felt the weight of the loneliness these two characters find themselves within. It resonated in a way that only handful of films ever have or will... which in itself is the mark of a truly great film. From Bill Murry and Scarlett Johansson's profound characterization to Sofia Coppla's visionary style this is definitely one of the must-see films of 2003.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|simply put,<BR>buy this,<BR>after you're done with it you will go through withdrawal because there won't be any more episodes to watch. ever.<br />lets keep hopin for the movie though.
B00006G8O1|2.0|During the first twenty minutes or so, I found DONNIE DARKO to be fairly interesting and even somewhat entertaining. The reptilian rabbit head was just plain bizarre and kind of creepy and enough to keep me interested for awhile. However, things didn't start to make any sense and crucial pieces and elements of the \\"plot\\" started disappearing left and right. By the time the film ended I was wondering to myself, \\"What in the world was that all about.\\" Now after reading a few reviews here, I can see how the whole dream-thing fits in and the movie sort-of makes sense. However, if it was all a dream, then this movie is just one big cop-out. Had the movie been written and edited together better, then this would not be the case. But it is.<br /><br />The writing is awful. Everything is all choppy and convuluted and doesn't make any sense. Of course, if it's all a dream, it does make sense. But, the thing about dreams is, nobody really likes watching other people's dreams. Dreams are difficult enough for the dreamer to understand, yet alone anyone outside in the \\"real world\\". Dreams are very personal and usually should be kept that way. That's why movies that are dreams on celluloid usually just don't cut it as cinema. A dream has to be restructured to make sense on the screen and if it isn't, it falls apart.<br /><br />However, even if the film did make sense, it still wouldn't be all that great. The poor writing has already been mentioned, but the acting is even worse. Jake Gyllenhall does a decent job as Donnie Darko and the young lady who plays his girlfriend isn't too bad either. Outside of that, most of the actors in this movie seem less believable than a cartoon. Patrick Swayze is one of the big names who has a secondary role in the film. His character seems like somebody who has taken too much speed; I mean Chris Farley's Matt Foley was a better and more believable motivational speaker than this guy. Then there's the other big name of the film, Drew Berrymore. Drew is a brilliant young actress, but in this movie she sucks. She plays a teacher who is dismissed for teaching a graphic novel in class that the school board believes leads to school vandalism. You can tell that Drew just doesn't relate to the noble profession and good old American teachers because her performance is as stiff as a brick wall. One of those Fandango paper-bag puppets could pull off a more believable performance than she did.<br /><br />The acting is pretty lame, the writing poor, and the plot makes no sense. The whole thing is supposed to be a dream, but comes off as being a cheap cop-out. Therefore, you will probably either love or hate this movie. I personally couldn't stand it after the first twenty minutes, but thought the reptilian rabbit head was creative enough to be worth a glance.is a brilliant young actress, but in this movie she sucks.

B00006879E|5.0|i honestly only bought this cd because i couldn't get Harder to Breathe out of my head and i wasn't sure how the rest of the CD would actually turn out. i was very impressed. most of the songs are catchy and once you learn all the words, you'll constantly be singing along, in your head, or actually to the music. i definitely recommend this cd!
0393317552|1.0|There  is  a fallacy  at  the  heart  of  Diamond's book  that  has  not  been  noticed. What  Diamond  does  is  give  the  reader  a story  as  to  why  this   or  that group  of  people  did  not  develop  a civilisation: that  story  always  depending  on  there  being  some  feature  in  their  local  environment  that  was lacking.  The  message  is  that Western  civilisation  was  a matter  of  luck, of  being  in  the  right  place  at  the  right  time. Had  New  Guinea  tribesman  been  where  the  Romans  were  then  they  would  have  founded the  Roman  Empire  instead. <br />The  trouble  with  this  is  that  the  existence  of  a story  does  not  mean  that  it  is  the  correct story or explanation. The  fact  that  an  environment  (say that of the New Guinea tribesman) is  non-conducive  in  some  way  does  not  mean  that  that  is  why  civilisation  did  not  develop  there: civilization may not have developed there *even if it had been conducive*. That is, the non-existence of civilisation there could have been overdetermined by more than one factor. Yet  Diamond's book  is  built  on  and  around  this  logical  fallacy  with  no  apparent  awareness  of  it.<br />So  why  may  civilisation  not  have  developed  in  the  places  that  it  didn't? For  an  alternative  explanation  see  the  book  IQ  and  the  Wealth  of   Nations, by Lynn  and  Vanhanen. The  brisk  message  of  that  book  is  that  civilisations  are  built  on  intelligence, and  where  intelligence  is  not  then, perforce, civilizations  do  not  grow. People  may be  reluctant  to  swallow  that  bitter  truth-but  that  will  not  make  it  go  away.<br />But without a refutation of this alternative explanation, Jared Diamond's book looks like a series of Just So stories-of the kind: why the lion doesn't laugh.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|I gave it 4.5 stars! Great album, lryics are deep, thought provoking, inspiring. Music sounds good, sounds alot like Tool. Makes sense why the songs would, but whats missing is Tool's drummer and &quot;other guitarist&quot;, and those two ROCK! They take the  music to another  level thats not quite reached here in my humble opinion.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I am a fan of indie films, so I'm not just biased against the genre.  I really do think this film is boring and stupid!  The concept is wonderful, the acting is as it should be, the chemistry is there, the setting is atmospheric - and director Sofia Coppola, like some kind of indie George Lucas, takes great material and just pulverizes it!!!  I don't care whose daughter she is, she is just proving that the only thing worse than her acting is her directing!  I guess film talent ISN'T hereditary!<br />OK, now that I've gotten the ugliness out of me, I'll try to stay objective.  I really wanted to like this movie - I like the actors, and the idea of a platonic love developing between two displaced Americans was a wonderful concept to me!  I just wish the film had spent more time developing that instead of the lingering shots of Scarlett sitting at the window, or Bill sitting at the bar just looking bored.  I wish there were less lingering shots of Scarlett walking down this street and then that street and then sitting on a bus, then at a cafe, then in the bath-tub!  Any half-competent director can establish in about three or four shots that these characters are lonely and depressed!  <br />What I wanted more of was actual connecting dialogue, some hint of character development.  Instead, once the two FINALLY meet after about thirty minutes, you get a quip from Bill, a laugh from Scarlett, then a \\"see ya round,\\"  Shampoo, rinse, repeat for about 70 minutes . . . annnnd scene!  So what happens in the end?  Are they in love?  Are they going to see each other again?  Has anything about them changed?  No, all we have is a movie that succeeds in only ONE thing - making the viewer feel as bored as the characters.<br />I for one am sick and tired of independent films like this one getting praised up and down when there are so many good ones out there that are much more worth a watch!  Want a good indie night?  Go rent THE DAYTRIPPERS, CLOCKWATCHERS, and MEMENTO for starters!And, for a MUCH, MUCH better look at the amazing Scarlett Johanson, check out GHOST WORLD, THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE, and GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING - GHOST WORLD even has some nice jabs at just this type of overblown, art-house filmmaking!  Give this one a pass - don't let the critics make you feel less cultured and stupid just because you expect a plot and a story progression for your money!<br />Best Picture?!?  God forbid!<br />One last thing - the marketers, realizing how boring this movie is as a drama, thought it would be more effective to sell it to the unsuspecting public as a comedy!  WRONG AGAIN!  There is nothing funny in this movie beyond some wry and ironic moments that, frankly, thrive only on racial ignorance of Japanese culture and their inabilities to pronounce \\"L's and R's\\" properly - yep, the humor is THAT sophisticated!!  I thought we were a living in a more culturally advanced society - but if I were Japanese, I would have been offended at the portrayal.
B00006690G|1.0|okay- when he first came out- he was the sh#@.  now- what? same played out style. couple of okay tracks- beat wise only.  on top of all that- he dares to diss the great Canibus?  that is suicide.  <br />he needs to go back to his freestyling/battle raps.  this cd sucks. so does everyone who gives him a 5 star rating.
B000089RVX|5.0|That I like this cd, but it grew on me within two days after listened to it for awhile and really listening to the lyrics.  The lyrics are very deep and talk about things from love, misunderstanding, suicide, and abuse among other things.  I love the background vocals on this cd which bring out the songs and adds to the lovely voice of Amy Lee.  At first, I thought I would just like the songs, Bring me to life, Going under, and My Immortal, which were played a lot on the radio, but other songs stand out on this cd.  Such as Everybody's Fool, Imaginary, Taking over me, and Hello which are my favorite.  I was surprised that they were as many ballards on this cd as there were.  The cd keeps a steady pace and all the songs fit; there's not a song this cd you'll feel is out of place from the rest.  The songs are dark, but not in a goth or angry way. The songs simply refect deep emotions of the authors and are all the better b/c they were written my the group themselves.  If you like Bring me to life, but are not sure about the others you should give it a try.  The songs are like poetry really. I would suggest this cd to people who like alternative/rock/classical(there are a lot of string instru. in the background of a lot of the songs also electro sounds) music that's not too hard. Will be looking out for their next cd!!

B000001EC1|1.0|I have always loved Bon Jovi's great rock sound so I HAD to shell out the cash to buy this at Christmas time to treat myself.  You can imagine my disappointment when I started playing Livin' On a Prayer (one of my all-time favorites!) and realized it was an ACOUSTIC version, not the rock version that I love so much.  I hit skip and went through listening to every song on the C.D. and was furious when I realized they were not the great rock versions that Bon Jovi is famous for.  I tried to return it to Target where I bought it and found out that because I had opened the shrink wrap I could just exchange it for the same crappy C.D. And then recording artists wonder why so many people illegally download songs!!!  It's because they shell out $15 to buy a C.D. and then find out it's not what they thought it was and can't return it after they were mislead to think it was a ROCK Greatest Hits C.D.!  Hey Bon Jovi, next time you do a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album be sure to notate if it's an all ACOUSTIC version so you don't lose any fans and P.S. I want my $15 back!!!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|if you like movies that go absolutely nowhere and have zero character development and have scenes that always seem to go on about 5 minutes too long then you'll love this one! the humor always seemed to play out like an inside joke that i just wasn't in on...it's just not a funny film, it tries very hard to be one, but it isn't...and it's a shame b/c bill murray and scarlett johannson are terrific actors and they are wasted on a pointless and tired script....i really have no idea why critics and people alike are just raving about this one, i walked out of the theatre about 3/4 through the film, one of the best decisions i've ever made...
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Today I was in the music section of my local Barnes and Nobel, debating to buy Boy from Oz or the new Stephen Schwartz musical Wicked.  Stephen Schwartz has for many years been one of my favorite composers. His songs with there stealthily rhythm and wizardly lyrics help to project great imagines in our minds of the show's we are watching or just listening too. But it seems that his scores seem to have great songs hidden in-between so-so songs; until now. <BR>     With Wicked Stephen Schwartz has taken his place with great composers as Rodgers and Hammerstein, Irving Berlin, Hart, and Webber. I've never heard a soundtrack with so many rich, heavy, and beautiful songs that paint an image in your minds that will leave tears in your eyes and a smile on your face. This is without a doubt one of the best musical soundtracks I've ever heard. <BR>     It would be a shame to see him not walk away with Best Original Score this coming June at the Tony Awards. Kristin Chenoweth and Idina Menzel are also going to have a fierce battle for Best Actress as both execute a Tony Award wining performance that is without a doubt one of the best of there careers.<BR>  Wicked is sure to be in a battle with Boy from Oz for Best Musical, but it's Schwartz greatest artistic achievement to date that will bring home the Tony for Musical and Score. Some of my Favorite songs in the show include &quot;Something Bad&quot;, &quot;Dancing Through Life&quot;, &quot;Popular&quot;, &quot;One Short Day&quot;, &quot;Defying Gravity&quot;, &quot;Wonderful&quot;, and the beautiful and tear jerker &quot;For Good&quot;.

B00005JMJ4|4.0|I am a japanese who has spent a great deal of time in both japanese and american cultures so when I heard of this film I couldn't wait for the movie to come out in Tokyo (sometime in 2004),and therefore bought the dvd.  The film started out great but the excitement gradually faded and became a bit boring. To me there were too many scenes in the hotel that built up on the  lonliness that just became too depressing. To the foreign eye, all of the scenes of Japan must've looked mysterious and beautiful. I think the cinematography was great and there were many beautiful scenes, but it seemed so fragmented. It's like okay here we have a scene in a buddist temple, next we have a scene of a wedding couple in kimonos in Kyoto, next... being japanese these scenes to me were like post card images and didn't really contribute to the plot of the movie. I'd imagine they had to do alot of guerilla filming around Tokyo because it's not easy getting permits to shoot large productions in public areas here. I appreciated the kind of relationship Bob and Charlotte had where they couldn't (or he couldn't) cross the line to become more than great friends, however I think the developement of the intimacy between the two suffered because alot of the time was devoted to trying to show the japanese culture. Don't get me wrong, this film probably had the most accurate coverage of what life in this city looks like (except for the lap dancing joint which looked alot more like someone's imagination).  Great film in terms of cinematography, music, tension, and bringing out the exotic feel of Japan,  but I think it may be a bit overrated as for being nominated for best Oscar picture.
B000006YMP|3.0|After the Swedish supergroup ABBA decided to &quot;take a break&quot;, both the girls in ABBA (Agnetha &amp; Anni-Frid) decided to make solo-albums. Wrap Your Arms Around Me from 1983 is Agnetha Fältskog's first English solo-album and it's an okay album, but perhaps a bit bland. There's nothing new here, nothing really exiting.<br />The Heat Is On became a smash hit all over Europe in the summer of 1983. To me personally it's actually one of the weaker songs on the album.<BR>Can't Shake Loose is a bit more rockier and was a single in North America, later on also in Europe. <BR>Shame is actually one of the better songs. Nice tune, with nice lyrics.<BR>Stay sounds a bit boring and the song is too long.<BR>Once Burned, Twice Shy is another of my favourites. A strong song but was apparently never considered for a single release.<BR>Mr. Persuasion is a nice songs which reminds me of the sixties.<BR>Wrap Your Arms Around Me is a nice, seductive song, a bit long though... When it was released as a single in Europe it was thankfully edited.<BR>To Love is a nice romantic lovesong with clever lyrics.<BR>I Wish Tonight Could Last Forever is a bit the same... it doesn't really go anywhere.<BR>Man was written by Agnetha Fältskog herself and it's definitely one of the strongest songs one the album. It's a shame Agnetha didn't wrote more songs for the album.<BR>Take Good Care Of Your Childeren is absolutely the worst song on the album. Terrible lyrics and a terrible reggae arrangement.<BR>Stand By My Side is a nice song, although I think it would have been better if To Love would have been the closing tack instead of this one.<br />As a whole it's a nice debut solo album from one of the greatest voices the popmusic has ever known. Still the album repeats itself and it tend to get a bit bland and boring. Agnetha played it safe, unlike Frida who experimented a lot more with sound on her English solo-albums
B0000DI86O|5.0|It is going to be a long, a very long time indeed, before we see another Chenier to rival this fabulous 1985 Covent Garden performance. Domingo was in excellent voice, and he meets every vocal challenge with virile, golden tone. Even if he lacks that brilliant spinto of Corelli, he has what it takes for this formidable role. Of recent tenors none comes near. The rest of the cast is if anything, better. Anna Tomowa-Sintow, Karajans favourite soprano is a glorious Maddalena: full voiced, warm, compelling, she is quite simply extraordinary. Baritone Giorgio Zancanaro gives a master class on how to mould a phrase in the old Italian style. His big aria is delivered with the kind of musicianship not heard since the days of Amato and Battistini.<BR>Sound and picture are good and you would be completely insane to pass this dvd.
B00003CX95|4.0|Braveheart is the story of one man's rise to free his people from the clutches of a tyrannical King and the people who loved him ,died for him, betrayed and yes finally lived for him.It is an epic that combines all the elements needed for telling a great story.Romance, intrigue,war ,drama,conquest and superb dialogue.One easily falls in love with the main characters.This was definetly mad-max at his best in both the starring and directing roles.A DEFINITE MUST SEE!!!!
B0000W3YIS|5.0|&quot;In the Zone&quot; is undoubtedly the best pop album I've purchased in a really long time!  I was never much of a fan of Britney in the past, but she definitely gained my respect with this release! Most pop albums that are released suffer from monotony and overproduction, but ITZ has neither of these problems. The quality of songs are excellent and, more importantly, they are each incredibly different from one another. I have listened to this CD countless times and it never gets boring for this reason. Every track has something different to offer the listener and every possible taste in music is satisfied. Britney's voice is extremely well-suited to every song and she sounds better than ever! I've gotta give her major props for this album and, to those who aren't, you clearly haven't listened to it!! I strongly suggest you pick up this album even if you're not a fan of Britney.  The bonus tracks included on this version only enhance an already excellent album!  You won't be dissapointed!!
B00004I9VE|4.0|Undoubtedly this the best MJ album ever.This is the stuff classics are made of.Billie Jean,Human Nature and Beat It there was no stopping this man.Very few albums ever come close to being this good!!!!
0790729628|1.0|I am a huge fan of Sci-Fi. Not to the point where I can tell you the name of the chick's aunt who played Cordelia's third stake in Episode 4,000,258 B of Buffy, but I like the genre just the same, and some of my all-time favourite flicks (Star Wars, Alien, The Fifth Element) are true-blue Science Fiction.<br />Imagine my disappointment, then, upon renting this Director's cut version of Blade Runner, and discovering that not only is it one of the most boring Sci-Fi movies ever made, it's also pretentious and overstated to the point where you really don't care if you never see the end.<br />With a potentially excellent premise - the plot, on paper, is exciting and detailed) and a decent ensemble cast (with Sean Young doing what she seems to do best, playing emotionless characters), Ridley Scott and Vangelis manage to totally negate any character sympathy we might feel through over-the-top panorama shots, long, drawn-out cityscape sequences, and the most awfully Eighties-Fantastic soundtrack ever.  Cliches like the Bar sequence abound, and are we really expected to believe Daryl Hannah in her role as the grating, whiney Pris? At least Splash was mute for a part of that movie...<br />One of the most annoying features of this film is the performance given by the usually excellent Harrison Ford. I can imagine Ridley Scott telling Ford to play the role as Indiana Jones-without-Humanity, and that's exactly how he comes across. Boring and wooden, as the central character in a movie whose basic premise is the conflict between humanity and machines, his character is the major flaw in a film full of boring, OTT cliches and unengaging dialogue.<br />One for the Vaults, may it languish there forever more. There are far, far superior examples of Science Fiction available.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Some films overwhelm the senses with audio and visual effects in an overzealous attempt to capture the audience's attention.  Lost in Translation will not challenge your surround sound system, or dazzle you with colors.  It is simple in plot and direction.  And it is in its simplicity where writer/director Sofia Coppola creates brilliance.<br />The story, put simply, is about the feeling of being lost in a crowd.  A middle aged American movie star in Tokyo to promote a Japanese whiskey (played by Bill Murray) meets a stunning twentysomething woman (Scarlett Johansson)who's in town to accompany her workaholic husband (Giovanni Ribisi) on a photo assignment.  They both are insomniacs who are unhappy with their marriages and unsure of their purposes in life.  Night after night they find solace in one another's company not for sex, but for companionship.  There is a sexual tension between the two, of course, but it's repression adds to the characters' bond.  <br />The subtext to the story surrounding Scarlett Johansson's character, Charlotte, is particularly intriguing because Coppola has hinted that it is autobiogaphical.  Immediately you will notice that Charlotte looks/acts/speaks like Sofia Coppola.  Her young photographer husband, Johnny, looks/acts/speaks like Spike Jonze- Coppola's real life X-husband.  So upon realizing that these characters are based in fact, the appearance of a Cameron Diaz look-alike (I mean, it's scary how similar this actress is in voice and mannerisms to Diaz) as an actress to whom- it is hinted- Johnny had an affair with, makes for a very naked declaration on Coppola's part...  <BR>note:  for those of you who may not know, Spike Jonze directed Cameron Diaz in his debut film Being John Malkovich.  It is rumored that an affair between the two resulted in Jonze and Coppola's breakup...<br />Not to be forgotten is the acting in this film.  Scarlet Johansson is on her way to becoming a major star, and her performance is Oscar worthy.  Bill Murray has been an underrated actor for the entire span of his career and this film may be the role that finally gets him the credit that's long overdue.
0156027321|5.0|I discovered this novel at Munroe's Bookshop, a terrific bookstore in downtown Victoria, B.C.  I visit the store  once a year and always inquire about the best new Canadian fiction.  Hence, I purchased The Life of Pi well before its sales took off.   Somehow, though, the concept of a man and a tiger on a boat struck me as a bit weird and Dr. Doolittle-esque. I put the book aside.   It was only recently that I began listening to the audio version when I had a long drive.  I forgot my initial skepticism as I listened to Part I with growing interest.  Then out of nowhere came Part II - &quot;The ship sank.&quot;  Suddenly this absorbing coming of age novel turned into an instant version of Jack London's riveting  &quot;To Light A Fire&quot;.  I was transfixed, engrossed, mesmerized, and could not stop listening.  When I took a break from the audio, I returned to the book, and back and forth until finally I was done.  All I can say is, &quot;Wow!  What an incredible story!&quot;
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I started watching this series on and could not stop.  This is an amazing show, and I can't believe FOX killed it the way they did.  I tried watching the show when it was on TV and I hated it, but what I did not know was that they showed the series out of order and they showed the first episode (the one that makes the whole series believable) last.  The can only think that they deliberately killed the series, but I don't know why.  Maybe an executive made the decision to green-light the series then got fired and his replacement was a moron.  Maybe FOX just wanted to make Whedon happy to get their hands on Buffy and Angel syndication for FX and FOX.<br />Anyway, let's get to the real review.  The acting is great, the writing is both funny and moving, the Chinese accents are horrible (but hey, at least they tried), and the series has a much stronger opening half season than Buffy or angel ever did.  Edlund adds a humor to the series that left my side hurting at times.<br />Top notch show.  I am sad to say I was happy to see it go when it was on FOX, but after watching the series, in order, it is far less confusing, and _the_ best sci-fi show I can think of.  (Well Maybe Automan was better, but I was too young to make a sober judgment on that show, I admit).
B0000VAFNQ|4.0|Unlike most/some I had an idea of the story but never bothered to listen to the details.  Given that I believe, as I do with many movies, that it is best not know too much about the story so as not to build up any expectations.  Even with that I was pleasantly surprised, it wasn't too much of a love story (thankfully!) and the plot had a few little surprises (but don't look for any big twists). There was just a slight shift in my perception towards the end, which was one of the nice little surprises.  I like horror/vampire movies, strong female characters and I won't usually admit this, but I'm beginning to believe that I am a closet goth.  I got really excited when I learned that there's a book (I'm sure better detail) but not that it was a movie first, oh well.
0553382179|5.0|BRAVO, Flylady, and thank you from the bottom of my heart!<br />Whether you read her affirming, encouraging words online or in her book, you will definitely be receiving the boundless wisdom of a woman who knows what she's talking about.<br />So many of us don't realize that we are paralyzed not by an inability to get things done, but by perfectionism.  Flylady's system takes the reader firmly but gently through the tiny baby steps that it takes to get daily routines established -- &quot;hot spots&quot; uncluttered -- and, eventually, an entire home in order.<br />Don't fear -- this is not a method that will require you to exhaust yourself through huge, endless cleaning projects.  No, indeed!  It's all about doing things in small steps.  <br />And it absolutely works!<br />If you haven't slept in your own bed for weeks because of the unfolded laundry sleeping there; if you hide when the doorbell rings because you haven't washed your hair in two days; if you can't see the bottom of your sink for all the crusty dishes inside it:  THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU!<br />I heartily recommend it.
0385720920|1.0|I was given this as a Christmas present with the recommendation that it was \\"hilariously funny.\\"  And, if all you read is the sound bite quips every 20 pages or so, it might be.  But, as commentary on contemporary society, sex addiction, unemployment, theme parks, dementia - each topic works out to about 3 pages from a sad (and redundant) professional journal article spread out through an entire book interspersed with all the dirty words that are really no surpise anymore.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Yeah the first two movies are amazing. Everyone knows this. <br />The first appeals to the cinephile for its design and pacing. Ridley Scott's re-edit is one of the first that I have seen that actually shaves scenes that are about 2.4 seconds too long, making the sequences tighter and in my opinion better. You won't notice the cuts unless you've seen the original too many times.<br />The second appeals to everyone with a pulse. One of the greatest action movies ever made and one of the few to be able to boast an &quot;its not over yet&quot; sequence that truly dwarfs the rest of an already exhilating movie. Yeah, a few of the added scenes I feel were better left out due to poor execution but they certainly don't ruin the film.<br />The third film is problematic. Yet it still looks really good and the new edit I actually find to be a better one as well although at this point I have to wonder if its just because it is new. One of the gretest editions to this set is the documentary on the making of Alien 3. It's fascinating! 2 things about it I found especially striking. One was the amazing story Vincent Ward had originally pitched to the Fox Executives which was whittled down to the less expensive, less risky version which was filmed. The second was hearing the executive in charge of production admitting that they went into the film to make a specific date instead of going into the film to create a great movie. Well worth the price of admission.<br />The fourth movie is bad. Just plain bad. The new intro to the movie is amazingly awful which is somehow more appropriate for the tone of the film than the nice sense of unease the original credit sequence created. Seriously folks its a bad, bad movie.<br />Despite number four this is an amazing set. Buy it!
0679428895|3.0|I enjoyed the historical and technical aspects of this book...especially when Vesuvius erupts---however, I was disappointed  on some of the formulaic- often predictable &quot;bad guy/good guy&quot; routine and the love story angle...but, I guess some readers need that!!! I still recommended---a quick and enjoyable read.
B0000C1733|5.0|Ah yes the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  They've been around for twenty years and amazingly they going just as strong, arguably stronger, then when they began way back in the 80's.  With an already great prior greatest hits release it was way past time to offer up a new retrospective  on the second half of their career.  This CD does that in fine form due to the excellent songs choices and, just as importantly, the order in which they flow.  The balance is perfect which makes for a very smooth listening experiece that never gets old.  Now onto the songs:<BR>Under the Bridge: Everyones heard this one so there's really no explanation necessary, there's a reason why this is the first track.<BR>Give it Away: ditto for this one.  One of my personal favorites, a nice party song with excellent lyrics,  how can you resist?<BR>Californication: One of their most popular songs and an instant classic.<BR>Scar Tissue: very beautiful and melodic, reminds me of the summer and other things.  This CD would not be complete without this song.<BR>Soul to Squeeze: Finally this was released on an RHCP cd, I did not want to have to buy the coneheads soundtrack!  A very welcome addition with a great tempo change 3/4 of the way through that brings it all together.<BR>Otherside: Along the lines of Under the Bridge in its theme I would say, vocals and harmony equal excellent song.<BR>Suck my Kiss: Rock out track with a smashing chorus, the kind of music you would play in your car or while doing some possibly illegal activity.<BR>By the Way: Perfectly constructed song that basically is a summary of their progression in the music industry.<BR>Parallel Universe: Different than anything they'd done prior, They are always stretching their sound which makes for rocking songs like this one.<BR>Breaking the Girl: A classic, best part towards the end with the instrumental blaring.<BR>My Friends: The only track from One Hot Minute and with guitarist Dave Navarro, who is very talented musician.  A very prettysong.<br />Higher Ground: Pre Blood Sugar Sex Magik cover.  I enjoy singing along to this while in the bath, sounds different from the other songs but you can't beat having this right before Universally Speaking.<BR>Universally Speaking: My favorite track, right now, on the cd.  Beautiful chorus, i just wish i knew what the hell it was about.  But that just adds to the mystic of it all.<BR>Road Trippin': Acoustic song with my second favorite chorus, right now.<BR>Now the two new songs<BR>Fortune Faded: New single and very catchy.<BR>Save the population: I love this song, nice way to close the album and a little of things to come.<br />To summarize it is a great cd, i reccomend the version with the dvd.  We all have our own idea of what a greatest hits cd should be like so if you are dissapointed with the track selection deal with it!  Buy now!<br />Regards,<BR>Alan Smithee
B00005JKZU|5.0|I have seen all three films and consider them to make up the greatest trilogy ever and this film is my favorite of the three!  I have seen it several times. <br />The band that got together on the journey to Mordor in the first film is split into 3 groups.  The Troll, Elf Archer and the man (who is destined to be king of men?) make up one band while Frodo and Sam make up the second band, and the other two Hobbits make up the third group.  We basically have stories going on simultaneously and the director brilliantly goes from one to the other.<br />The film introduces Smeagle, a &quot;Shrek-like&quot; animation who is one of the most fascinating characters in film history.  Frodo and Sam encounter Smeagle who becomes their &quot;guide.&quot;  All the while Smeagle is a split personality, and his evil side is planning to steal the ring from Frodo (he calls it &quot;my precious&quot;) and to kill Frodo and Sam.  <br />The other two Hobbitts encounter a race of giant tree-men.  While the rest of the band go to a fortress to fight one of the best filmed battle scenes in movie history against a tremendous force of zombie-like warriors.  While watching the men in the fortress prepare for the battle you feel like the are like the men of the Alamo preparing to fight an inevitible losing battle against overwhelmingly large forces.  Amazing scenes show brave little kids and elderly being armed to fight againt the evil hordes.  The battle itself is so well directed and filmed that you feel you are right in the middle of it!
B00005YW4H|1.0|Beige. Non music. Vapid and slightly sinister. Lesbian? Anyway, she didn't come
B0000025YL|1.0|Yes, that's all there is to it. This is sterile, outdated, boring crap that borrows heavily from equally sterile, outdated, boring crappy bands like Judas priest and AC/DC. Listen to Melodic death metal like 90s Death, Amon amarth, At the gates, Arch enemy, In flames, Dark tranquility, and Carcass' Heartwork instead of this cliched trash. Peace out mullethead Iron maiden t-shirt wearing duuuuudz!
B00005UW9T|5.0|This movie is the best for all kid audenciens!!!!
B00005K9LN|1.0|Good God, Metal doesn't get any more sterile than this. What do people see in this crap anyway? The riffs are uninventive, the song structures are unimaginative and the drumming sucks. This album might sound &quot;killer&quot; to someone who's either been listening to Metal for about a day or is just incredibly stubborn. For those of you who haven't been living under a rock though, don't bother.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I haven't heard Fallen and Sarah until I watched the nominations for the Grammy and they used Fallen as a backup song so i really like it. Actually one of my friens died the day I bought Afterglow so I couldn't stop listenin' to Fallen wich I Believe is Sarah's best song since 'Angel'. I love all the songs of the album but my fave ones are Stupid and Wold On Fire. This album is like the new and revived Sarah whose better and cooler.
0380002930|3.0|this book was different. it was wierd that it was about rabbits. it did have many different layers and metaphores that gave it a deeper meaning, along with characters that were very skillfully developed, but the fact that it was about rabbits was hard for me to get past. if it wasnt about rabbits i might have enjoyed it more. i personally didn't like it too much but if you can get past the fact that its about rabbits than it really is a good story.
B00005JME0|4.0|Because most of the critics slammed this movie, I went to see it expecting a lot less than I got.  I thought the movie was fine: rich plot, good pacing, intense drama, and solid performances by all of the actors.  Ashton Kutcher, who has a great screen presence (I've never seen him before; don't watch much TV) played the role with just the right degrees of intensity, bewiderment, and desperation.  Amy Smart's performance fluctuated convincingly from loyal lover, to air-headed ingenue, to hardened prostitute, etc.  And I loved the way the other supporting characters changed personalities with time shifts.<br />The kid actors looked very much like their adult counterparts, especially in Kutcher's case, so that the constant transitions between pre-teen, teen, and adult versions of the characters were very smooth...  this was important to keep the audience suspending its disbelief.<br />The screenplay delved into taboo subjects fearlessly, which I think added to its richness and made it all the more riveting. <br />Most of the critics didn't like this film, and I suspect a lot of that has to do with their personal disdain of Kutcher. That's neither relevant nor fair. Roger Ebert tried to be fair in his review and did say some good things about the movie, but he was bothered a lot by the inexplicably artistic quality of the drawing and the note-lettering penned by the Kutcher character.  I agree that this high quality this was kind of odd, since the character was never portrayed as an artist, but I think that's a minor detail that detracted only slightly from one's enjoyment of the movie.  Overall, Butterfly Effect was a handsomely-filmed, \\"sci-fi\\" movie that didn't rely on special effects to hold my interest and entertain me.  It was a great ride.  What more could the critics want?
0385510438|4.0|When buying this book, I read the inside flap and saw that the book was to be about a man who goes to prison for muder, gets paroled, and ten goes after the jurors who sent him away. It seemed interesting, and another Grisham novel. Nver judge a book by the summary.<BR>For starters, Danny Pudgitt does not get out of prison until the last fift pages or so -- the the dust jacket has lied (which turned out to be a good thing). Instead, the book follows, through an amazing first person narrative, the life a reporter/newspaper editor in Clanton, Mississippi. We learn how he becomes involved in this case through the stories he publishes... and through a juror.<BR>In all, this bok is about Willie's relatioship with the juror, who is only a juror for a short hwile. Instead we learn of her life, Willie's life, and the desegregation of the 1970's in Mississippi.<BR>Rather than give a usual courtroom brawl, Grisham steps away from attorney here, and only writes about the court as a reporter would. The reporter knows nothing of law, except was he has learned from... Harry Rex Vonnor.<BR>This book reads like Clancy, where you wonder how so many storylines will tie in, but is smooth like Grisham has always been. It brings back past characters (Harry Rex, Judge Atlee, and, nicely, we meet Lucien Wilbanks before he is disbarred).<BR>All in all a suberb story, though at times Grisham reiterates himself so strongly that you wonder if he had forgotten what he has written.<BR>The story had snares, which made me ask to get back to the story... to Danny and the jurors. <BR>If you are looking for a mirder mystery or courtroom drama, don't buy this. Rather, this novel excemplifies teh fact that life goes in in the world, and, even with a small town murder, there are other things to talk about. It is a new way of writing for Grisham, with two surprises at the end -- one of the endings should be spotted by anyone who has read \\"The Summons\\" or \\"The King of Torts,\\" but it still leaves you thinking of how real the story is.<BR>When I began reading, i could not put it down, and am glad for the fact. Stunningly written, beautifully crafted, truly original. Four out of five stars. This novel is a magnificant triumph from Grisham that shows he is still original and at the top of his game. I only have one request for the author -- please give Harry Rex his own novel.
B00008PX8P|5.0|There's a reason why Led Zeppelin has so many fans and this DVD proves it. The music is ageless and the band has had an enormous influence in shaping rock music. The solos of Jimmy Page and John Bonham alone are good enough reason to spend your $20 on this DVD. The passion for their art and their musical genius is clearly visible in Led Zeppelin's performances. It could not come at a better time, especially when it appears that the muse for music has abandoned the contemporary rock scene.<br /> A CD I would recommended is \\"Have Guitar Will Travel\\" which contains some of Jimmy Page's uncredited songs and some of the songs which he produced esp. \\"Witch Doctor\\" by John Mayall and the BluesBreakers feat. Eric Clapton. It will enhance the appreciation of Jimmy Page's incredible talent on the guitar and shows how he can easily switch between blues, rock and metal in contrast to the \\"specialist\\" guitarists of today.
B000006OS2|2.0|Excellent movie, but the quality of the DVD is terrible-very grainy.  It's like they copied a videotape.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Because of my schedule, I had taped Firefly on the VCR to watch later..and boy, was I missing out! The DVD made me realize how fabulous the production values were..something an old VCR tape could never do.  The widescreen format is great, too. <br />Even if you were a casual fan of Firefly, buy this set. Otherwise, you're missing out on one of the best episodes, &quot;The Message,&quot; which never saw the light of day on Fox.  Jayne's hat was a hoot! <br />Keep your fingers crossed and hope the movie gets made someday soon, because the Firefly story is far from over...at least for me.

0452282152|4.0|I decided to read this book almost on impulse and, although I had heard excellent things about it, I did not expect what I got.  The story is of Griet, an adolescent who works as a maid to support her parents in the home of the artist Vermeer.  The plot centers around the relationship between Vermeer and Griet.  The heroine, telling her tale as a more experienced and mature adult, endears us to her and makes us understand her very self.  The author did an excellent job in creating the psyche and fellings of a young maid atracted to her master and the consequences those emotions entail when they are combined with the actions of a true artist whose only real love is his art. I loved the way the author created Vermeer as a mysterious and romantic character and as a true artist whose life is his work.  I was charmed at the way the author explained how things in Vermeer's pictures came to be, down to the very details of the strange headdress worn by the Girl with a Pearl Earing.  Although this book will leave you somewhat depressed it will also make you think and leave you with a satisfied felling of having read a very worthwhile book.
B000007ODM|5.0|I just want to say that it's strange,but very interesting music with others sounds witch we dont hear on radio or TV.I meditation with this music and go in other space,secretly.
B00013PHGS|5.0|What a shame that this CD is getting poor reviews based solely on the fact that it won't play on some PCs. While I am not a fan of &quot;enhanced&quot; CDs, I feel that it's unfair to give this album a less-than-stellar review simply because it won't play on certain computers.  The music is simply magnificent - total satisfaction from start to finish. While it may be unfortunate that it won't play on certain antiquated computers, it shouldn't keep you from buying this masterpiece of an album. <br />Technology: 3 Stars<BR>Music: 5 Stars
B0000667RO|5.0|It's very good album my favourite rocker,its from serie N.Carter.D,Chervet,,Leap of faith''.Its my best music and i like it.yeah rock going on...
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Like all the other people that have written a review on this movie that have hated it, I don't see what the fuss is about. In recent history of my theatre experiences this was only of one of two movies that I wanted to leave. The other was Unforgiven with Clint Eastwood. Both were extremely boring but at least Unforgiven had some action in the end. This had NOTHING! If it wasn't for Bill Murray this movie would be my new 'worst' movie ever. It's rather fascinating how others can see how this a classic portray between two people. I see it as two people who find each other and that's it.
B0000W3YIS|1.0|Her lyrics are lacking in intelligence and will perforate your ears. There were some tracks that were ok musicwise but her voice obstructed this album. Breahe on Me, Shadow, Everytime, Brave New Girl, Toxic, Me Against the Music, The Answer and Don't Hang Up were semi-listenable but get boring after awhile. Only extreme fanatics of Britney or people who like whatever is popular should pick this one up.
B000000OR9|5.0|To anyone who is a Hard Rock music lover this is a must buy! This album ranks right up there with anything that Led Zepplin, Van Halen, Def Leppard, Gun's and Roses, Motley Crue or anyone else for that matter put out! Ever since first getting this album in '89 after seeing the video Valley of the Kings on MTV I've been consistantly measuring this album up against all incomers. From start to finish it delivers hard rifs and smooth lyics. I can only think of maybe 5 other Rock albums that are as complete as this one.

B00000I8NC|5.0|This is by far my favorite GYBE! recording.  First of all it is an EP.  It only has two songs but clocks in around 30 minutes regardless.  Fans of GYBE!'s other works will not be disappointed with this release.<BR>The first song, Moya, is a beautiful and inspiring masterpiece.  In typical GYBE! fashion, it starts quite and serene and builds up to quite down again and to finally climax in a massive orchestral crescendo.  <BR>The second song, BBF3, which stands for Blaise Bailey Finnegan the third, is the most powerful song by GYBE! to date.  It opens with a man speaking to an interviewer.  The man is basically expressing his discontent with America and its government.  This seems rather old hat for the band, but it is a very powerful statement that the man so passionately presents climaxing in a reading of Virus, a song by Iron Maiden.  All during this powerful dialogue the band is playing , first quite and building in intensity as the man gets more and more emotional.  When he is done speaking, the music takes over in full force, with more intensity, emotion and despair than any other GYBE! song.  After the climax somewhere between 14/15 minutes, a group of stringed instruments takes over and ends the album on a sombre, and thought provoking note, thus ending another amazing Chapter in GYBE!'s amazing career.

0380002930|5.0|When this book was assigned to me in English class, I was eager to see what this book was all about. I thought it was a joke. How could someone possibly write a novel consisting of rabbits adventuring around inseek of a new home. As soon as I began reading Watership Down I realized it was more then just a silly book about rabbits, but a heart-warming tale. It taught life lessons and showed the emotions of inferior beings to the world. Though this book is about rabbits it still is a book that should be read by a mature audience. You need to have an understanding of life and why the rabbits react to certain situations. The rabbits were just the chosen characters to present this real-life novel, any character could have been chosen. Don't back down just because they're rabbits, give this book a try.

B0000041CZ|3.0|Every time a pianist plays Bach on a modern instrument, they make an interpretive choice--the Well-Tempered Clavier is NOT the Equal-Tempered Grand Piano.  I'm not so much a purist to claim that such an interpretive choice is wrong, but I raise the issue to point out that interpretation is inevitable.  So to condemn Gulda for playing in an ahistorical style is wrong.  Gulda is extremely aggressive, approaching the music like a pugilist, hammering every note in some of the fugues, treating the individual note with single-minded intensity, always playing without pedal (historically correct, of course), unrelenting and not at all Romantic.  In spite of this intensity and clear committment to a personal vision of the work, one can question the particular choices he makes, and I find myself doing so all too often.<br />The C minor fugue, for example, is as dry and staccato as a sun-bleached bone.  (The \\"thinness\\" other reviewers speak of is not, I think, a quality of Gulda's performance but of the instrument he uses, the room acoustic, and/or the engineering. ) Gulda's approach deemphasizes the sense of line most modern performers take, but allows him to think more structurally--he certainly shapes the fugues overall with varying levels of dynamic intensities.  The 5 voice C# minor fugue comes off beautifully in this respect--I think it's his most engaging performance, and Gulda's intensity matches the dissonant quality of the work wonderfully.  in fact, all of the C# pieces are excellent--perhaps it's Gulda's key!  But the C minor fares less well.  I find the dynamic swell at the end too great and too sudden--not quite a terraced dynamic that might have occured in Bach's instrumental music, but neither a carefully controlled crescendo.  The effect seems more like a student who suddenly realises he's at the end and should have been playing louder, so saves what he can and overcompensates.  Furthermore, in this particular fugue some of the countersubjects are lost due to Gulda's overemphasis on the subject proper.  In the C major fugue, Gulda takes an extraordinarily slow tempo--I've never heard another performer take this tempo, or even anything near it.  The consequence is that the stretto entries of the subject are quite easily recognized--not an easy thing in this fugue, with its constant stretti, but again, a feeling of longer line is lost.<br />Generally Gulda's approach is an excellent one for clarity of counterpoint, but I find the overall aesthetic almost completely unattractive.  Clearly Gulda knows the notes, has made thoughtful choices about how to play this music, but it's not an approach that I prefer.  Of course you should decide for yourself, but listen to the clips Amazon provides before you order.to Gulda's overemphasis on the subject proper.

B00004TH7Z|5.0|I got this Cd a while ago and at first I didn't think it was all that great but now it is one of my favorites.  It's right up there with Number of the beast, at least in my opinion.  The songs have a rousing power metal feel to them at times but that is all the better for me because I like bands like Blind Guardian and Helloween.  All of the songs are great and worth listening to at least once.  Don't become impatient with the songs that start slow like Dream of mirrors.  Give them a chance and they will grow on you.

B000002UA2|5.0|This is a CD that can hold its own with many of Pink Floyd's greats--do not pass it up simply because it is a &quot;non-concept&quot; album.  It is, in fact, the last non-concept album that Pink Floyd would produce until A Momentary Lapse of Reason.  Therefore, what the listener ought to focus upon is the power of the music.  This disc really does a nice job of forecasting some of the beautiful music that will later appear on The Dark Side of the Moon.  The entire CD is underrated--and that is why I have chosen to open this review with ObC's most underrated track.<br />That, in my opinion, is &quot;Absolutely Curtains&quot;.  To be honest, it is beyond my understanding why this song seems to bother so many people.  It's quite heartwrenchingly played by Richard Wright...there's something mournful and mysterious about it that his fans would recognize from his solo song &quot;Interlude&quot;--that same feeling of standing frozen upon the edge of *something* that's about to happen, not quite knowing exactly what it is.  I know the song is credited to the entire band--but its *execution* is largely down to Mr. Wright: the song, aside from percussion and tape effects, consists entirely of a synth (VCS3?), Farfisa and Hammond organs, Rhodes and acoustic pianos.  While Pink Floyd obviously did not know what was to come, it's quite chilling to listen to this song bearing in mind that they *did* in fact stand upon the edge of an era that, while filled with great promise, would also result in great pain.  This is the very side of the music that, over time, was forced out of the music and only regained in later years.  As for the chanting, I personally find it mesmerising.<br />Another historical rarity on this album, for which it should be treasured, is the appearance of the powerful Wright-Waters songwriting team--something seen only on this album and Dark Side of the Moon.  Had Roger Waters had more respect for his opposite, this could have gone even further, as these tracksprove how perfectly they complemented each other.  Look at &quot;Burning Bridges&quot;, the best of these songs: here you have a gorgeous, memorable, and *innovative* tune, along with enchanting (not overbearing...not yet!) lyrics.  I should also point out that the mixing is the boldest for Mr. Wright's vocals to ever appear in a Pink Floyd album before the song &quot;Wearing the Inside Out&quot;, making it quite a treat on the ears.  &quot;Mudmen&quot;, the instrumental companion track to &quot;Burning Bridges&quot;, adds to Mr. Wright's gorgeous chord sequence some guitar work that might remind the listener of &quot;Time&quot; although with a backing more like &quot;Us and Them&quot;.  There is no doubt that both David Gilmour and Richard Wright were now ready for The Dark Side of the Moon.  (A bit of trivia--someone pointed out that the time signature is changed between &quot;Burning Bridges&quot; and &quot;Mudmen&quot;, a very interesting subtle sign of musical innovation.)<br />Perhaps the most *chilling* of all the predictors on this album is the lyrics to &quot;Free Four&quot;, put on a backdrop of music that is entirely too happy for the subject matter (intentional sarcasm on Mr. Waters part, I believe, similar to &quot;Corporal Clegg&quot; on A Saucerful of Secrets).  The lyrics, in a way, are a precursor to every theme that Roger Waters will dwell on in future works, particularly The Wall.  His fans will probably see this as a welcome introduction to his more serious approach to music--others may see this song as hailing the future destruction of the band.<br />&quot;When You're In&quot;/&quot;Obscured By Clouds&quot; is a quick rock instrumental opening that shows Mr. Wright's Hammond technique in fine form.  &quot;The Gold, It's In the...&quot; is perhaps the album's weak point--a track that sounds less like Pink Floyd and more like the Doobie Brothers: basically a simple rock tune, but still enjoyable enough.  &quot;Wot's uh the Deal&quot; is a very pleasant &quot;Pillow of Winds&quot;-like tune with interesting lyrics, nice vocals by David Gilmour...not THE best of the album, but very soothing and likeable.  &quot;Childhood's End&quot; is written solely by Mr. Gilmour, and while musically (except in the intro) doesn't really deviate from standard rock, it's lyrically one of his better outings, just under &quot;Sorrow&quot; and &quot;High Hopes&quot;.  &quot;Stay&quot; is the other Wright/Waters outing, and my suspicion based on the ordering of credits is that the lyrics, similar in theme to &quot;Summer '68&quot; (describing the emptiness of a one-night stand) were *mostly* written by Rick Wright himself.  My personal guess based on intuition is that the chorus is Roger Waters--the rest is Rick Wright, and his vocals are very pleasant to listen to.<br />Overall, this is a disc that all Pink Floyd fans should make sure to pick up, both for its own intrinsic qualities and for the almost prophetic way in which it indicates the future direction of the band.

B0000029DD|5.0|The first time I heard &quot;Grace&quot; was by accident, but that accident tuned me into one of the greatest albums of all time.  I have never heard anything so beautiful:  the lyrics, the melodies, the chords of the guitars all perfectly harmonize into this Jeff Buckley masterpiece.  The opening song &quot;Mojo Pin&quot; starts out slow, but ends with a punch, just as this CD does.  The first time I heard &quot;Last Goodbye&quot; I nearly cried.  You can almost feel the pain and sadness in the lyrics.  The melodies and lyrics are so wonderfully interwoven.  &quot;Grace&quot; is the perfect title for this CD.  All of the songs display a hardcore gracefulness about them.  While the music is melodic, the lyrics defintely deliver power.  This album is the closest thing to pure poetry in music and always has the ability to put me in a relaxed mood.  Though his life ended too soon, Jeff Buckley leaves behind a work of art that will keep his spirit alive.
B00006RINF|4.0|To understand my point you need to know two facts about me. First, is that I tend to like the darker half of the art of music. Second, is that I decided to buy this album because I'm a big fan of the Dutch band The Gathering.<br />What's presented on this record is melodic goth metal built around beautiful voice of Cristina Scabbia. There's not much to say about the instrumentals because their main task is to create a haunting soundscape where Christina's excellent voice would entrance the listener. The band does it just fine, and Cristina never disappoints. On most tracks male singer helps Cristina, too. His voice is kind of high and strong, but unlike singers in those power-metal bands, it has some raspy edge. While I can't call the guy a great singer, his performance is generally good, and Cristina vs. Andrea vocal interplay works much better than, for example, what was present on Nightwish's &quot;Century Child&quot;.<br />Curiously, to me this record's appeal starts from track #7. &quot;Swamped&quot; is a good floating track, albeit a little fuzzy. And &quot;Aeon&quot; is more like an interlude, not a finished track in itself. But between these two songs lies the most mainstream mass-appealing goth-metal I've ever heard. Don't get me wrong, popularity is a good thing. But as with most songs made to mass-appeal, they are too fast to fall in love with, and just as fast to bore you to death. Plus, as I said before, I don't like &quot;positive goth-metal&quot; that much, because the dark side is more to my liking.<br />But from the song &quot;Tight Rope&quot; and up to the end of the album there go tracks that I'm very fond of. &quot;Tight Rope&quot;, &quot;The Ghost Woman and the Hunter&quot;, &quot;Entwined&quot; are real gems here. But other songs aren't worse, too. My CD also has a bonus track on it, which is a soothing ballad-like song, also good.<br />While I'd prefer any The Gathering album with phenomenal Anneke van Giersbergen vocals to this Lacuna Coil record any time, still the quality of half of the tracks here make for an enjoyable time, and I do play it occasionally every now and then. And I'm yet to buy their previous works, which, I heard, would be more to my liking.
0671027344|4.0|I read this book as a 17 year old female in high school.  I feel that my 14 year old brother and 45 year old mother could also read it and enjoy it just as much as I did.  A boy's journey into highschool, friends, drugs and sex are layed out before you wondering whether he is making the right desicion for his life, and if he is not, wanting to yell and scream at the main character, Charlie, for not following the right path. I think that everyone, male and female, should read it and learn a lesson from this 16 year old outcast child.  I would not recommend it to children under the age of 14-15 because the contents are mature and they might not understand the point of the message.  Girls and boys in highschool should read it so they can understand what others might go through, and mothers and fathers so they can understand what their child goes through during their 4 years of high school and beyond.
B00005JMCT|2.0|Why must hollywood ruin everything? This is the final chapter in the American Pie movies &amp; that's a good thing. Part of the problem with the last two 'Pie' movies is that there isn't much original material. They all follow the same formula: Humilate Jason Biggs, Stifler is the comedy &amp; also does something disgusting (ex. eat dog poop), Finch &amp; Stifler's mom, Jim's talks with his dad, &amp; some blatent nudity scenes that don't need to be there.<br />The original was new, fresh, and a genius of a movie. This one is just awful. If you like Stifler, however, this is your movie. Don't get me wrong, I think he's hilarious at times. The other two films gave you his humor in doses. In this flick he is given free reign and he is sometimes irritating. I mean what 23 year old is still going to act like that? Honestly, I don't care about the marriage. You never get a romantic feel from the little chemistry Jason Biggs &amp; Alyson Hannigan have. I don't even know why Thomas Ian Nichols is in this movie. He doesn't have much to do here. Eddie Kaye is back as Finch. Even his character is getting old. And if I have to hear about him &amp; Stifler's mom again, I am going to throw up. Even the bachelor party (a.k.a. the nudity) felt forced. Does Jim only have three friends in his life? And the 'relationship' between Stifler and Michelle's sister is idiotic. There is NO WAY that a girl would go out with him after he treats her like he does in this movie. But, welcome to hollywood.<br />The movie is not a total loss, though. Jim's dad is back and as funny as ever. Stifler does have some really funny moments. His attempt at wooing Michelle's sister are quite funny. January Jones is incredibly hot. And that's about it.<br />The only reason I bought this movie was because I wanted the trilogy. I think it's the worst of the three, by far. I wasn't all that crazy about part two either, but at least it FELT like an American Pie movie. It had all of the characters (even though some were just there for show), &amp; it had some funny moments for the other characters. This film is all about Stifler &amp; it falls flat. It should have never been made in the first place. I can't recommend this movie for more than a rental.<br />Even the special features are somewhat disappointing. There are deleted scenes, outtakes, bachelor party featurette, a cheesy wedding video, etc. Nothing special here.
B00009TB5G|4.0|The extended edition DVD's are just amazing. It gives you so much information on the movie that you never knew before. I will say some of the documentaries were rather boring, and really were stating the obvious. The cast commentaries can be hilarious at times, and boring at others. Honestly, I only baught this for the deleted scenes. They alone were worth the extra money. Most of them are so important to the story and you wonder why they would dare take them out. In the original releases there are alot of holes in the story, and alot of questions that go unanswered. When watching the extended edition alot of that is cleared up. They even add the scenes into the movie, instead of at the end like most other movies. <BR>The Two Towers is the second in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and in my opinion the best. The first movie kind of drudged on with character development, and left you hanging at the end. This picks up directly where they left off, and even takes you back a little to remind you of what happened in FOTR. It's an action filled adventure that begins to take each character further into their emotional journey. They even add a bit of humor throughout most of it. <BR>I started out watching the original releases. Then after the release of Return of the King, I read the books. I was a bit disappointed with the movies after that. They left out so much that was important, and completely changed part of the story lines. After reading the books I decided to begin watching the extended editions, which took away alot of that disappointment. There is much more to these films than was shown. The documentaries give you a bit of history on Tokien. They take you into the writing of the screen plays and explain why they had to change the story lines. They also give you an indepth look on the making of the movie, and further into the designing of the imagery. My favorite one is the one taking you into the creation of Gollum. It gives all these tid bits of information that make it even more spectacular than it already is.<BR>I'd say if you're going to buy any of the LOTR DVD's you should buy the extended editions. They are far better than the others. It may seem like alot to be spending on a movie, but really when you think about it. $30 is not a bad price for 4 disks full of incredible detail.

B000002UAR|5.0|&quot;Revolver&quot; has historically played second banana to &quot;Sgt Pepper&quot; as far as The Beatles' musical innovations are concerned. Yet there would be no &quot;Sgt Pepper&quot; (an album I admittedly find a little TOO 1967 for my liking) if not for &quot;Revolver&quot;. All the recording techniques and trickeries we take for granted today were pioneered on &quot;Revolver&quot;, thanks to The Beatles' exploration of new sounds, aided and abetted by producer George Martin and engineer Geoff Emerick. This album was made on a four track- state of the art in 1966. Times have changed, but &quot;Revolver&quot; initiated all the changes.<BR>          As for the songs themselves...what makes &quot;Revolver&quot;, in my opinion, the greatest rock album ever is the fact that EVERY song is good. That's rare enough any time. All you need to do is look at the track listing and you know you're looking at a masterpiece. As a musician and songwriter myself, you can't help but admire the scope and ambition of these songs. For me, the biggies are &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; and &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;, likely two of the most socially significant songs of the modern era. &quot;Tommorow Never Knows&quot;, an LSD inspired Lennon track that pushes the envelope of recording techniques (it was the first track recorded for the album) probably defined the hippie generation. &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; is one of the strongest songs about the 'lonely people' (little people?) you'll ever find...all the more amazing coming from Paul McCartney, who isn't exactly known for his depth (as his numerous solo albums testify.) And, to his credit, &quot;Revolver&quot; is mostly McCartney's show- Lennon was embarking on his acid overindulgence that nearly rendered him non compos mentis for the rest of his life (he could have been another Syd Barrett, by his own admission.)<BR>         No...there is no &quot;She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah&quot; to be found here. Hence why I feel that &quot;Revolver&quot; marked the death of &quot;Rock and roll&quot; -your normal fifties hangover sixties music- and announced the birth of Rock. No wonder The Beatles gave up touring- in those days you couldn't reproduce these songs with just guitars, bass and drums. Sequencers and samplers simply didn't exist in 1966. Which makes &quot;Revolver&quot; all the more significant.

B00005JMJ4|1.0|I'm reviewing the disc itself here, not the movie. If you're unfamiliar with the movie, you can take your pick from hundreds of reviews online.<br /><br />This disc is terrible:<br /><br />1. Universal's decision to bundle ten minutes of ads at the beginning, which cannot be skipped, is classless and grubbing.<br /><br />2. The mastering is poor -- compression artifacts are evident in dark scenes, and the overall image feels slightly blurred.<br /><br />3. The audio is poorly mastered, too, abruptly changing levels several times. Did anyone even supervise this transfer?<br /><br />4. An insert of some kind would have been nice, even just a photo card. Opening the sleeve to just the disc is a mild letdown, and left me wondering if only my copy is like this.<br /><br />It's a shame a movie this enjoyable was pushed through such a shoddy production process. Let's hope another distributor gets their hands on this soon and does it right.

B0000959N0|3.0|Daredevil is a pretty good. It has a good cast and, despite the cheesy CGI, I like it a lot. The characters and out of this world action keep things moving at a brisk pace. There are plenty of comic book inspired moments of fantasy, tragedy, romance, and humor. The movie may not have the depth or the slow pacing some would prefer, but this isn't the English Patient. Daredevil is an acceptable movie equivalent to a comic book and it packs plenty of punch.It's fast paced, and maybe too much happens too quickly, but it's never dull and entertains. Not the best movie ever, but far from the worst.

0553213105|5.0|Like others, I came to this novel after years of it being pushed upon me like a drug. \\"Read it, you'll love it!\\"  It took several starts and a snowy winter far from home to finally render the book's period drama understandable. As a student and fan of women's history, I was initially drawn in not by the plot of the story (though it is what soon carries you through to the delicious conclusion) but by the fascination of viewing family life in another time. As with any period piece, geographical, political, and mannerly allusions are lost without some historical understanding of the time. Not every \\"great book\\" is for every person. Also, PandP is very much a romance; you must be willing to romanticize to truly appreciate Eliza Bennett's struggle and change of heart. So don't feel you must read it just because others tell you to. But if you find yourself in a wistful mood, ready to be immersed in another world, give this one a try. Chances are, it will lead you to a minor obsession with Jane Austen.<br /><br />Extensions of the original: If the recent movie starring Kiera Knightley was enjoyable, the book will be more so, with richer details and more drama. Also recommended as a companion is the fullest dramatization of the book, the BBC's version starring Colin Firth. And for a chick lit homage, read the Bridget Jones books.
B0000DD7NL|2.0|I like the idea of alicia keys. A girl who admires the 70's and wants to produce albums that sound like it. Good for her but I like her bands music more than I like her voice. In #1 Harlems... she just talks and talks and in you don't know my name she talks and talks again. Shut up and sing girl.
B00003JRCQ|4.0|A marriage prospect rejected years earlier due to money and class differences seems to be on the lovers' minds as they encounter one another once again. As with all Jane Austen tales, however, the path to marriage is littered with meddling family and friends and many moments of doubt.<br />This is a slow moving but very romantic movie. Heroine's struggle builds quietly to a very satisfying conclusion. Lead characters, portrayed by Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, aren't meant to be the prettiest, youngest, or most unforgettable people you'll get to know; their story centers on the internal struggle of what's at stake in seeking a second chance.  The movie, like the book, has an understated feel and includes several little twists and turns. Well acted, classic settings, and a gentle romantic air throughout: I heartily recommend this movie.
B00008AY3L|2.0|The first song on this album is great, but I felt like I heard it before from Bob Marley. The second song is annoying and repeatative, the third song did nothing for me. The fourth is boring and the 5th is a good slow sad song. That is all I heard and from that information I gathered Ben ain't nothing to really listen to. There are better artists out there that have a better sound than he is trying to achieve. Like Lenny Kravitz.
B00005V3Z4|1.0|This film is essentially just another teenybopper flick, very similar to the Scream movie series - where high school kids are played by people in their twenties. However, the kids in this movie (including the protagonist) act so stupid you would think they really are high school age. <br />It seems like all it takes to get people to think a movie is good these days is to throw in some gimmicky &quot;nothing is real&quot; twist at the end and all of a sudden it becomes good cinema. I'm sorry, the characters in this movie are bland, uninteresting, dull people, while the plot consists of a bunch of random incoherent occurances thrown together in a haphazard fashion. The wormhole effects are the only redeeming factor to what is otherwise a total mess of a film. Watching this movie made me want to jam nails into my skull.<br />This movie is a lot like another atrocious film: Signs. Throw a bunch of poorly thought out scenes together with no logical plot and then throw in a twist in the end to explain everything. Trust me, you can do a lot better than watching this movie. I would rather watch cards being shuffled for an hour and a half than watch this movie. Avoid.
B00005IC2H|2.0|They have a sound all their own. You know that lethargic feeling you get when you hurt and you have to run and go to the bathroom but you just can't so you crawl and it takes you forever. This is what the music feels like. Really slow and the singer or whomever speaks jibberish so... I won't even try to make sense out of this album cause you can't and please don't ask me to spell any of their singles names. It has potential to be better if they could.. put a better arrangement together.
076790592X|3.0|The appeal of this book seems to stem from the process of placing one's self in Morrie's place, gathering a sense of his circumstances via the narrative, and gaining an admiration for his reaction to those circumstances since none of us would ever want to face them ourselves. In that respect, it uplifts and inspires. Morrie's personality seems naturally engaging as various bits of conversations are related between himself, the author and others. This was a man who tried to live life to it's fullest before life decided to betray him. In this respect, I believe there is something here for everyone who reads this book and I do recommend it. However, I do have two problems with it.<br />The first problem is that the power of it's message is reduced by redundancy. Though repetition can be a powerful form of communication, it can reach a point of diminishing returns where you, as the reader, begin to wonder when the author will say something he or she has not already said several times previously. At this point, repetition actually hinders the presentation and this is what happens in Albom's writing style.<br />The second problem is that Albom writes in an occasionally overdramatic fashion. Now I, personally, tend to balk at overdramaticism because I feel that it tends to be used when the person telling the story does not trust that the story can hold it's own without extra embelishment. This story can hold it's own - but it is overdramaticised anyway. Albom sometimes puts so much space between his phrases that you feel as if you are supposed to think these are earth shattering pronouncements. Now, don't get me wrong, I do believe that you sometimes have to ellucidate a story by having the occasional flare for the dramatic but this book overdoes it. Morrie seemed to be a dramatic enough person on his own without some of the extra attempts at drama and, in this respect, the book gets in it's own way. Thus, I give it three out of five stars.
B00006LLNU|4.0|wow. i can't believe i am even typing this but i like this album. a year or two ago i read an article that said this band has a cd with every song untitled. i laughed and was like oh they are trying to be different and cute! but today i actually listened to the album and its good. the first untitled i do not like because it sounds like a cat slowly dying but the reat of the untitled songs are good.
B000002U82|5.0|The most important thing about this fantastic album is that it could be perfectly been made today. 30 years after been published it sounds really clear (Alan Parsons had something to do).<br />Not only would I mention the technical quality of this recording. This is a collection of ten songs or themes, but it sounds like a huge orchestral suite. In fact they were two. I don't know what would Roger Waters and his mates would do in the present using CD's and not two sided LP's (?).<br />Listening to &quot;Speak to me&quot; and &quot;Breathe&quot; is like an introduction of the symphony. It's the mere ouverture. The preparation of a &quot;high fidelity first class travelling set&quot;.<br />The second movement (and movement is the word) is for &quot;On the run&quot;. Fantastic emotions, impressive music.<br />The third movement is a song: &quot;Time&quot;. Time for the lyrics, time for Roger Waters and his philosophy of life and how time is always wasted. &quot;It's the English way&quot;.<br />The finale is &quot;The Great Gig of the Sky&quot;, which seems to announce death and the end of this amazing journey.<br />In the other side a new trip starts with &quot;Money&quot;. Another sarcastic lyrics but in this time it's David Gilmour's moment of glory. In &quot;Time&quot; we could listen to a collection of riffs and harmonies of this guitar guru, but in &quot;Money&quot; Gilmour is as his best: I think his technique is perfectly comparable to Jimi Hendrix's.<br />Nick Mason introduces the calm athmosphere os &quot;Us and Them&quot;. It's a incredible song which mixes perfectly quiet moods and relaxing saxophone with strong pieces of desperation.<br />Next, &quot;Any Colour You Like&quot; is another prove of Gilmour and Wright talent. &quot;Brain Damage&quot;, finally is a fine poem of Waters which leads to the &quot;Eclipse&quot;. The story ends as it started. (Sorry, I haven't really told the end of the story).<br />&quot;I've always been mad. I know I've been mad, like the most of us. Very hard to explain why you're mad, even if you're not mad&quot;.

0440217563|4.0|&quot;Voyager&quot; is the third book in Diana Gabaldon's extraordinary &quot;Outlander&quot; series. If you have not read the two preceding novels, I strongly urge you to do so before beginning this book. &quot;Voyager&quot; may be able to stand as a novel in its own right, but I think it would be too confusing to enjoy it thoroughly without having read the historic and personal drama that Ms. Gabaldon details so meticulously in her previous books.<br />Claire Beauchamps Randall/Fraser had been sent back, (or forward), to the 20th century by her beloved husband James Fraser just before the 18th century Battle of Culloden Moor. Since both Claire and Jamie knew in advance of the battle's terrible outcome and the horrific consequences for Scotland, they decided that for Claire's safety and for the life of their unborn child, it would be best for them to part. &quot;Voyager&quot; opens 20 years after a pregnant Claire stepped, for the second time, through the standing stones and back to the present. As the novel opens she is a practicing physician in Boston and her daughter Brianna is a young woman, the spitting image of her Scottish father. Brianna does not know about her mother's strange adventures with time travel and believes her father to be Claire's first husband, Frank - the man Claire returned to twenty years ago. Although Frank accepted Brianna as his own and loved her with all his heart, the marriage was not a happy one. Frank could never bring himself to believe Claire's story of the strange events that occurred when she went missing. And Claire had never been able to stop loving Jamie...or longing for him. Frank died recently in an automobile accident and Claire is finally determined to discover what did happen to James and his clan after Culloden. She has made up her mind that if there is a possibility to return to James, she will. She is torn however, between the possibility of reuniting with her love after so many lonely years and not wanting to leave her daughter alone. Claire is also concerned with Brianna's reaction to her story. Frank never believed Claire...will her daughter believe her?<br />&quot;Voyager&quot; is the account of what occurred in Scotland and with James Fraser after Culloden and during the years the couple was separated. It is also the incredible detective story of how Claire, Brianna and a friend piece together enough historical information to discover Jamie's whereabouts so that Claire can find him. The initial part of the novel dealing with Claire's return to 18th century Scotland and her reunion with James is riveting, as is the description of a doomed Scotland, steeped in post war poverty and starvation, her men dead, imprisoned, crippled and/or jobless. This is the weakest novel of the three, however. When James and Claire make the decision to leave Scotland the plot noticeably wobbles. Some of their adventures are not very believable and others just too coincidental...almost forced. Without the backbone of history to strengthen the plot, as it did with the Jacobite uprising, the novel does some strange meandering. This is not to say that &quot;Voyager&quot; is a bad book or that it makes for poor reading. I found myself engrossed as quickly here as I did with Ms. Gabaldon's previous works and, with an occasional pause, found myself reading just as avidly throughout. I am only saying that this is the weakest link in a most extraordinary series.<br />JANAr daughter alone. Claire is also concerned with Brianna's reaction to her story.

B000001FHV|5.0|Too High To Die would be the most successful album that the Meat Puppets would release. Before this, they had released several strong albums but only had a small but loyal following. The members of Nirvana were part of this following and they had the Meat Puppets open for them on their last tour and also featured the band and their music on their MTV Unplugged special. This finally gave the Meat Puppets some long overdue exposure as radio and MTV finally started playing their music.<br />It remains a mystery how Too High To Die didn't become a huge success. The music presented here fit right in with the alternative and acoustic rock that was popular in the mid-90's. Although the track &quot;Backwater&quot; would become a minor hit single, several other tracks such as the acoustic ballads &quot;Shine&quot; and &quot;Why?&quot; could have also been hits if marketed correctly. The electicism of their earlier albums is on full display here. Whether it's the heavy riffing of &quot;Violet Eyes&quot; and &quot;We Don't Exist&quot;, the great melodic alternative tracks &quot;Severed Goddess Hand&quot; and &quot;Flaming Heart&quot;, the country of &quot;Comin' Down&quot;, or the blues-rock of &quot;Roof With A Hole&quot;, everything here is top notch. Other great tracks here include &quot;Things&quot;, &quot;Evil Love&quot;, and &quot;Never To Be Found.&quot; There's also an unlisted remake of their song &quot;Lake Of Fire&quot;, which was popularized by Nirvana on MTV Unplugged, at the end of the album. Simply a great album. Highly recommended.
044022425X|5.0|&quot;Drums Of Autumn&quot; is the fourth book in Diana Gabaldon's extraordinary &quot;Outlander&quot; series. It amazes me that Ms. Gabaldon has been able to continue to delight readers with her consistently good writing, excellent plots, superb characters and meticulous historic research for thousands of pages and four novels. &quot;Drums Of Autumn&quot; most certainly will not disappoint fans of the series. If you have not read the three preceding novels, I strongly urge you to do so before beginning this book. &quot;Drums of Autumn&quot; may be able to stand as a novel in its own right, but I think it would be too confusing to enjoy it thoroughly without having read the historic and personal drama that Ms. Gabaldon details so well in her previous books. To label the &quot;Outlander&quot; series as merely historical romance fiction would be to do it a terrible injustice. This is an epic historical romance, yes...and so much more. The relationship between Claire and Jamie is one of the most caring and intimate I have ever encountered - in fiction or real life.  This is a couple who are solidly committed to a life together for better or worse. Theirs is a love that truly transcends the boundaries of time.<br />More than twenty years before this novel begins, Claire Beauchamps Randall, vacationing in post WWII Scotland, stepped through the ancient stone circle known as Craigh na Dun - and was suddenly sucked back in time to 1743 and war-torn Scotland. It was here that she met and married her own true love, highlander James Fraser. Before the tragic battle of Culloden Moor she was forced to return to the 20th century to protect herself and her unborn daughter, abandoning Jamie in the process. Two decades later Claire made the journey back through the stones to reunite with James in the 18th century, leaving their grown daughter, Brianna, behind.<br />James and Claire both agreed that there was no possibility to build a life for themselves in Scotland. The clans had been forced to disband, the people were starving and living in abject poverty, most of the men were dead, crippled, imprisoned and or jobless as a result of the doomed Jacobite uprising. The Frasers along with a few friends and James' nephew, Ian, cross the Atlantic and make their way to North Carolina where Jamie's aunt has a plantation. At the same parallel time, 20th century Brianna and her beloved Scottish boyfriend Roger discover some terrifying information about Claire's and Jamie's fate. Brianna is determined to reach her parents somehow and warn them of coming events, hoping to change the future. The inevitability of these events and the frustration and inability to change the future continue to be strong themes.<br />This is a phenomenal novel! Ms. Gabaldon details frontier life in beautiful 18th century North Carolina so clearly and accurately that one literally feels swept back in time. Claire and James have grown tremendously as characters, as have the love and intimacy between them. I have never experienced a couple as unique as these two in modern fiction. New characters are introduced, as well as a marvelously vile villain, and in typical Gabaldon style, these new folks are portrayed with realism, complexity and humor as are many of the old favorites. This is also Brianna's story. She finally meets her father in &quot;Drums Of Autumn&quot; and becomes a woman with a woman's responsibilities.<br />The books in this series are among my favorites novels, not just because the plots are so fascinating that I am unable to stop reading once I begin...although this is true. The characters are so palpably real that the reader actually bonds with them, at least with Jamie and Claire, in a way that is most unusual and very moving. We follow their lives and observe them as they grow as human beings, experience joy, suffer, and just interact with each other on a day to day basis, as well as in the midst of high adventure. We watch as they make history and as history tears away at them. I cannot recommend this book and series highly enough.<br />JANAy tears away at them. I cannot recommend this book and series highly enough.<BR>JANA
B0000AXE8I|2.0|This movie was boring, very slow and should have never been made the frist Matrix was great but this junk was only made for the all mighty buck so dont give up yours for this junk the only thing good about this dvd it that it's widescreen.
0679879269|4.0|I thought it was a good book with deep concepts if one chose to search deeply.  If not, it could make for a good young adult's book as well.
0060977493|5.0|Greetings from beautiful downtown Poughkeepsie!<BR>C'mon people, this book ROCKS!<BR>Beautiful language, interesting characters, maybe a wee bit too much history, and a terrible tragedy all wrapped in a haunting little message:  Things can change in a day.<BR>Even the cover of this book is beautiful.<BR>The only bad thing here is that Ms Roy says she only had one novel in her.   Lets hope she's just kidding.
B00005JMCN|1.0|Unlike the thousands of people out there that love horses, i do not. And i dislike how this movie portray riding horses to be good. Why the f do we ride horses still, i'm sure they don't liek it. I mean, i don't liek horses but i'm not sadistic enough to torture them by riding on their backs. These s0-called people to &quot;love&quot; horses and ride them are insane.<br />the only reason why i dont liek horses is because of a bad experience in which someone could have helped me or a horse, and the person helped the horse, leaving me out in the cold.
B00000J7I3|5.0|TEN STARS! A must-have for anyone who loves the Crue, or just wants some kick-*ss rock and roll.  A much more raw, edgy sound that later Crue albums, but Too Fast gives you a taste of what's to come.  One of the greatest CD's ever!
B00005JM0B|3.0|I bought this movie having not seen it expecting a pretty good bit of action maybe some cool fight sequences with CGI terminator armies. What I got was fair action (the fight sequence at the beginning of T2 was 10X better without any CGI) but a story line that just falls flat by the end. While I am forgiving of some of the quirky science, I hated the 'twist' at the end of Skynet being software and the dark ending. The whole series was based on the fact that skynet was a supercomputer/mainframe. I don't want to sound like some scifi geek but if the program nukes everything what computer left is skynet planning to run on and how in the world is a software program that people wrote going to build thousands of terminators with everything destroyed. I know most people would say just have fun with the movie, but the central theme of the climax just plain doesn't make sense and with that I think we've seen the second sequel to a James Cameron masterpiece ruined (the first being Aliens of course, please don't tell me that anyone actually liked Aliens3)
B0001FI43O|1.0|2/3/04 Purchased video from Amazon.co.uk .The Jacket gives a summary of the plot which is about a young Black Male going to Ireland with his mother's ashes and to learn more about his family.  Rating will assuredly be higher when I am able to &quot;convert&quot; the PAL system  video to be compatible with the  NTSC system which is the one my Sony VCR uses.
B00008EY9G|4.0|This is an excellent movie not doubt about it. The story is so original and the acting performance of John Cusack and Ray Liotta is simply great. This movie is fill of thrilling scenes that will keep you wondering what will happen next. The ending is really shocking, and trust me you will not forget it.<BR>Hope to see more movies in this quality.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|OK - here's my deal - just caught a couple of minutes of the show when it was on the air and I'm not a proven Joss fan - I don't follow Buffy or Angel - so why did I buy this set?  Saw the reviews and thought I take the dive - after all a four disc set at this price seems like a deal.<br />I then sat down and dragged my wife over to watch the pilot and first couple of eps.<br />Now let me say I'm a long time sci fi fan from Star Wars in '77 as a kid but I'm no fanboy.  My wife enjoys the occasional action flick but would prefer a crime thriller any day.<br />Well we are blown away by the series - unbelieveable - the best TV I've seen.  We are so addicted that we ignored anything else on the TV - even the West Wing or Law and Order and watched an ep a night.  The writing and the acting are top notch.  I can't say enough about this series.<br />DEFINITELY PURCHASE WORTHY!!!<br />Now hurry up and buy the damn thing now.  I only pray they manage to get a movie launched or at least of books.
B000000WZ4|4.0|Depeche Mode nearly fell apart after the gargantuan Devotional tour was finally completed.  Dave Gahan was clinically dead for a few minutes and Alan Wilder had left to pursue his own project, Recoil.  Once Martin, Dave, and Andy resurfaced to take a stab in the recording studio, their goal was not to make another Violator; it was just to put down a few tracks and nurture the band back to health.  It wasn't time for another party album followed by another exhausting tour. It was time to just heal by doing something low-key and taking it easy for a while.  And that's why Ultra sounds the way it sounds.<br />With this perspective in mind, Ultra is as good an album as we could have expected from Depeche Mode in 1997, and is in some ways pleasantly surprising.  The first single, \\"Barrel of a Gun,\\" is actually nothing like the rest of the album.  It's got a beat like an automated stapler and a funky guitar riff pulled from hell's own orchestra.  Not DM's best song by any means, but it's catchy and it hits hard.  Other aggro offerings include: \\"Useless,\\" a very moody, bluesy, beat-up number well-suited to Dave's post-recovery voice; and \\"It's No Good,\\" which might just be the greatest stalker anthem of all time (perhaps second only to The Police's \\"Every Breath You Take\\").  I was shocked to hear an ex-girlfriend's younger sister and her friends singing along when I played \\"It's No Good\\" in the car, but I guess this is just evidence that DM are not dead yet.<br />The remaining tracks are much more subdued and introspective in nature.  Many of the songs on Ultra deal with Dave's drug problems, but \\"Sister of Night\\" probably handles the issue with the most heart and sensitivity.  \\"Freestate\\" is a mellow, optimistic song with a closing guitar solo reminiscent of The Cure.  This song and its kin \\"Insight\\" are the most upbeat songs DM had written in over a decade; perhaps you can only be a sad sallow goth for a finite amount of time.  \\"The Love Thieves\\" is the most narrative song on the album, depicting the kind of woman with more followers than she can count.  A song rich both in wisdom derived from experience and in sympathy for the smitten.  Finally, Martin's vocal performances in \\"Home\\" and \\"The Bottom Line\\" stand shoulder to shoulder with anything he's done in the past, yet keep in line with the mature, languid feel of the album as a whole.<br />Ultra is not an album that even a DM fan will instantly love.  It takes some time to win the listener over.  That Depeche Mode actually managed to put together an album at this stage of their career is miraculous enough; that they managed to put together a different yet GOOD album is just gravy on top of that.  Four stars for an album that is not the best in the DM library, but still gets better with age.ng on the album, depicting the kind of woman with more followers than she can count.

B000089RVX|1.0|Evanescence is totally overrated. I can't believe people are calling it metal. It is an insult to real metal. Evanescence is alternative pop rock. Amy Lee is not an exceptional singer. She is above average, but she doesn't have what it takes to be really great. Her voice is very distorted and it sounds like she has never heard of breath control. I would much rather listen to talented singers, like Tarja from Nightwish, or Vibeke from Tristania.  Also, their songs are boring. They go verse, chorus, verse, chorus, blah blah blah. The lyrics are sub-par. It doesn't take much imagination to come up with something so simple. Nevermind the riffs are something that should only appeal to a 14 year old Hot Topic poster child.  Evanescence is just a trend that will hopefully pass quickly. If you are looking for metal, this isn't it. If you want to swallow whatever the mainstream music industry tells you to, then this CD is for you. Frankly, I hated it.
B00005A46T|1.0|This Band is A SLAYER Wannabe band. You can tell by the first track off this album (515) isn't that kind of familiar to hum?The SLAYER song called 213 off DIVINE INTERVENTION or not? Second they suddenly got into DEVIL WORSHIP with about the same poor effort as their music I mean it sounds so POP it can't even be taken seriously. SLAYER has been doing this since they came out (1982) VENOM has been doing it even longer. At least these guys did it with more credibility and actually some of the band members are athiests. There music sucks anyway because it can't breath on it's own unlike &quot;REAL METAL&quot;  can thats why the singer cory tylor or whatever his name is never shuts up on the mic to let you hear the music or NOISE Because he knows it is that bad and that his stupid band will never be like SLAYER let alone any other great HEAVY METAL Band And to all those people who say they are tired of them being compared to SLAYER well they even stated in one of their IGNORANT videos that SLAYER was One of their major influences in case you didn't know that, SLAYER will forever crush this PANTY WASTE boy band
B00005RYLE|5.0|Enough has been said about the movie.  You should see it, and you will probably love it.  Once you do.....<br />For anyone who really loves The Evil Dead, whether it was then or you just discovered it, this is the DVD package to own.  I had never seen the movie with such clarity.  I had NO idea that it was so well done.  I should have known that it was better than those old copies of copies videotapes made it look!  It's Sam Raimi for goodness' sake!<br />But anyway, with the Book of the Dead artwork, the extras, and the article inside, it's a great thing to own and display.  I can't tell you how many people have been intrigued by the DVD just propped up on my entertainment center.  (It goes really well with the Julia figure from Hellbound, too!)<br />Buy it now.  You won't regret it.
B00003CWL6|5.0|This is one of the best directed movies of it's decade. Mendes and Hall were a perfect team as filmmakers. The movie is such a scathing picture of life in suburban America that it's almost hard to watch on first viewing. All of the acting is stellar. And, look for one of the most underappreciated bit performances in movie history; the girl who says, &quot;You were only in Seventeen once, and you looked fat...&quot;  The director's commentary on the DVD is a great way to better appreciate the movie, and learn a lot about filmmaking.  Out of 10 it's a 10.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This is a wonderful movie of two lost souls who for a short time seem to find each other and themselves...and then they move on. An unhurried, gentle and delicate reflection of searching for meaning and direction. It reminded me of &quot;Un Coeur En Hiver (A Heart in Winter)&quot;, this is unfortunately only available in VHS.<br />The plot is simple: take two thoughtful, intelligent but conflicted  souls out of their usual environment (place them in the familiar, but distinctly different city scape of Tokyo), take away their communication channels (leave only fax messages, cell-phone calls, poor translation attempts), their daily rhythm (resulting in a dazed insomnia) and have them discover what really matters the most to them.<br />Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is an actor, who sold his soul and talent for a 2 million dollar advertisement offer, while he could be in a play back at home. He is married with children. He is cynical, but never condescending.<br />Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) is way after the honeymoon of her 2 year marriage, with the doubts of a seemingly wasted Yale philosophy degree, who spends a lot of time staring through her hotel window or walking around in an impersonal city. She is gentle, but never sentimental.<br />During a few days in Tokyo they discover that what both of them were missing was intimacy and mutually stimulating companionship blended through the magical charm of romance.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This is my favorite movie of 2003.  For one thing, I like how it promotes Bill Murray as an actor, because he's so important to some of my favorite films like Groundhog Day and Wes Anderson's movies. However, I also think this is a great accomplishment for Sofia Coppola who seems to be establishing a directing style of her own with this movie. Like The Virgin Suicides, LiT is quiet, spacy, and subtlely beautiful. As a whole, the film is beautifully shot and acted, and captures the chaotic order of Tokyo perfectly. This is a story that is not based upon an intricate plot, action, or even dialogue. It's more of an atmospheric film which focuses on inner conflicts and the way those conflicts bring two people together.  9/10
B00011RPB0|3.0|In any other year, this movie would be a forgettable throwaway. It is a cheap &quot;star-vehicle&quot; for Scarlett Johanssen with a cookie-cutter script and a little-known woman director, strictly bottom-rung fodder in the Hollywood system. What then explains its strange popularity among the reviewers? It could be an utter lack of competition in the other offerings this year. But beyond that, the movie has a unique, unpredictable chemistry that strikes viewers as more sincere, simple and authentic than many big-budget crowd pleasers. Most significant is the rare maturity of Bill Murray's character for a modern movie, and his trademark understated performance. His character refuses to bed the vulnerable and lonely Johanssen, though he proves he is not above this with someone he respects much less. His advice on marriage is so viscerally realistic, it is almost cinema verite. <br />Understated acting is not the word - one feels the real Mr. Murray is speaking from the depth of his life's experience rather than an actor from a script. In the end, this is not acting so much as Bill Murray's own very contradictory character  - a performer who refuses to pretend. In all his movies, he seems to barely have the energy for the act, and rather clowns around with a barely concealed contempt for what he is doing. Sometimes this is disappointing and hard to watch, but in a vehicle which is not desperately trying to aim high, it can achieve unexpected wonders. The scene in the restaurant is another high moment. After being caught with another woman, Murray's character doesn't hide his eyes in shame, nor attack Johanssen cruelly. He looks right into her eyes, leaning back against the wall with a seemingly irreproachable depth of experience and exhaustion behind him and makes no excuses or apologies. Again, in this otherwise insignificant and inconsequential vehicle, this utter lack of pretension is gripping. <br />The movie I can most compare this to is &quot;My Cousin Vinnie&quot;, another throwaway star-vehicle for Marisa Tomei with Joe Pesci as the established older actor lending her his reputation and economic drawing-power. But again, that movie was a surprise popular hit. The storyline was so poor that the actors could only rise above it by assuming an air of derision, and it was precisely this which ironically gave the movie its feeling of chemistry, groundedness and authenticity. <br />Many Hollywood vehicles try desperately to imitate a successful formula for authenticity. Real art is that work which does not imitate, but achieves the real thing. Therefore, we must also perhaps credit the casting and Sophia Coppola's direction with understated grace, perception of the chemistry of her actors, and that all-too-rare Hollywood sixth-sense for the authentic.<br />But ultimately, I have to agree with the other reviewers - a popular hit, maybe, but otherwise pretty overrated.
B00005T30L|3.0|This film was directed by Terry Zwigoff, who, to his credit has made two very original movies.  However, if I were to recommend a movie by this director it would be the haunting documentary, \\"Crumb\\" (also recommend Birch in American Beauty, Buscemi in Fargo, and Johansson in Lost in Translation.) Ghost World was just not that memorable, and didn't quite measure up to it's potential for me.  Out of 10 I would give it about a 6.
B0000648WZ|5.0|That seems to be the consensus here.  A LOT of 1 star reviews and a lot of 5s.  I choose to give it a 5. While it's definately not the best film I've seen, it's one of the most fun.<br />I don't like Verhoeven as a director, but I enjoyed this film.  I have read Henlein before, but not the novel on which this was loosely adapated.  If you're a fan of the novel, I doubt you would like the film.  This is a great popcorn movie for those that enjoy mindless violence and nudity.  It makes a weak attempt at representing the social commentaries that Heinlein put forth in his novel, but it does an effective job of parodying the recruitment advertisements of the 40s.<br />I actually thought the acting was fairly decent, even though it is filled with B movie actors.  Maybe that's because the whole movie is a bit campy.  In any case, it's one of my most enjoyable films to watch, and I liked it so much I bought the original disc, only to find myself having to shell out more for this SE disc two years later.  However, it's worth it.<br />The Special Edition has a few improvements over the original press. Better looking interactive menus and maybe a slightly better audio and video transfer, but not enough to really notice a difference over the original. The disc comes with two new commentaries, one with Van Dien, Harris, Verhoeven, and Meyer that is a lot of fun.<br />Disc 2 is really the reason to upgrade your disc if you own the original.  A great &quot;Death From Above&quot; featurette that uses crew and cast interviews to look at the making of the film.  A &quot;Know Your Foe&quot; special that features more details of the bugs used in the film.  There's an FX featurette that gives you a behind the scenes look at many of the shots.  Then you have a fewer smaller featurettes, plus trailers of some other movies and the straight to video sequel: Starship Troopers 2 (which I'll probably pass on seeing).  Also, 12 mins wasted however on storyboard comparisons.<br />I wouldn't buy this DVD if you've never seen the film before.  Rent it first to see if you like it, because opinions on &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; vary drastically.  If you do enjoy it, this is a great DVD to buy, and definately worth grabbing if you have the original disc and keep being remind of the question: &quot;would you like to know more?&quot;<br />Sign me up.'t buy this DVD if you've never seen the film before.

B0000067L2|5.0|While uninformed observers of rock and pop music correctly point to 1967 as a pivotal influential year, they incorrectly highlight Sgt. Pepper and Magical Mystery Tour as the best, most influential, and most &quot;psychedelic&quot; albums.  Not even close.  If psychedelic art is to be evaluated, one look at Disraeli Gears puts that argument to rest.  And as for the music, Strange Brew and Sunshine easily outshine the competition.  Buy this album, and Are You Experienced by Jimi Hendrix if you want to experience the leading edge of music in 1967.<br />Get the Beatles and the Monkees if you want the lite pop fare.
B00008YLV2|4.0|Black Hawk Down was an excellent movie portraying a disaster, from an American perspective, that occurred during our time in Somalia.<br />Harnet is believable in his role.  The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Mass mayhem and bloodlust of those seeking to destroy an American convoy which at first was sent to kidnap a Somalian VIP, then attempting to save the crew of a downed Black hawk helicopter.<br />If this was a very true account, so many more of the people of Mogadishu died in this battle.  America lost too many men for the goal that they originally had.  Can we learn anything from this?  Maybe we need to always have a clear goal with all factors supporting the effort.
B00004ZAV3|3.0|This is a pretty good collection of Beatles songs for several reasons.  About half the songs are from the early years, in which the Beatles recorded their best music.  Fortunately, there are relatively few songs from the Beatles middle years, as there are no songs from either Rubber Soul or Sgt. Pepper, and only two from Revolver. The last half of the CD is OK, but hurt by tracks like the Ballad of John &amp; Yoko.  Generally worth the price, even if you only play the first 14-15 songs.  3-stars.
B00005JKL8|4.0|I can't believe I missed this movie until now.<br />I think the action, Wilson running, his pursuers, reminds of another movie where Hackman was on the run.<br />Well, turnaround is fair play.  Wilson is sarcastic at the beginning of the movie.  You cannot tell if it is going to be a comedy at the first.<br />His character develops, both cinematically as well as personally.  This shows the raw change that a person can go through when facing an ordeal.<br />This is a movie that inspires courage.  I consider it to be very watchable.  The war scenes are not shoot-em-ups, they tend to add reality to the story.
B000001ESP|5.0|I am kicking myself right now for all those years I didn't listen to Rush.  I just got into them during their Vapor Trails tour, after knowing of them for my whole life, just about.  I missed the Vapor Trails tour, but I really wanted to go.  But this album, though, is now my all-time favorite album, knocking Pink Floyd's masterpiece Dark Side Of The Moon out of the box.  I will listen to this album from front to back without skipping a single song, that's how good it is.  I am a synth nut, and never have I heard synth and hard rock blended together so well.  Rush is WITHOUT A DOUBT the best Canadian musical export EVER.  Celine Dion?! BLEHHH!!
B00005JKN9|3.0|I found little meaning in this movie.  I enjoyed the idea and the historical setting, yet it seemed a little surreal.<br />It was much like 'Once Upon a Time in America.'  If you like that type of movie, you would like this.<br />The senseless gore of the film was what irked me the most.  DiCaprio is not too believable, yet Lewis rocks as a the archetypical villain.  He is utterly believable.<br />It is a story of revenge.  DiCaprio's character at least did not give up his quest to avenge the death of his father.
1858286999|5.0|The Rough Guide is hands down the best travel guide on Japan.  The writing is fresh and informative, the practical information is up to date and helpful, and the data is accurate.  For the amount of material covered, the depth is amazing ... From Hokkaido to the islands of Okinawa you can navigate the entire country with just this book.  And not just \\"navigate\\", but plan what to see, where to eat, and where to stay with a variety of options.<br />The main complaints previous reviewers have concern the occasional mistake and the lack of pictures.  Of course, when you try to summarize an entire country in a thousand pages there will be mistakes and omissions, and of course information will go out of date.  Which is why you should always double check your sources, or be prepared to roll with the punches.  Most places have websites and even the smallest cities in Japan have at least a little bit of tourist information in English.  If you're spending the time and money to come all the way to Japan, what does it hurt to spend a little bit of extra time on the internet double checking the details on places you want to see.<br />The same goes for pictures.  Personally, I'd rather wait until I get to a place and see for myself what something looks like, but when it comes to pictures (or maps) the internet is a treasure trove of information.<br />No matter how well you plan things, there will always be hangups.  Traffic is bad.  A place you want to see is taking the day off.  A bar you want to go to has closed its doors.  The best you can do is get as much information ahead of time and hope for the best.  From my experience living in Japan, if you are going to rely on one main source for your travel information in Japan, use the Rough Guide.  It's better than anything else out there.
B00005JLT5|5.0|This is a truimph of a story.  A Warsaw ghetto survivor making it through the war, suffering, alone, scare and scarred, yet undaunted.<br />It showed the human side of tragedy, the cruelty and the heart.<br />Brody plays his part excellently.  This movie kept me riveted.  It is worth owning.

B000068TPN|5.0|A hero twice.  One of the fire fighters who died in 9-11 was a hero caught in this horrendous fire fight in Nam.  Knowing that really gave this movie a sense of reality.<br />Gibson's portrayal of Moore and his caring for his men was very heart rending.<br />It pictured the senselessness of the battle, and, it seems that the first major battle in Viet Nam set the stage for all the rest.<br />The frustration at the loss of life, the lack of command and control, the lack of support, the distance from any supplies.<br />Compared to Irag II, Viet Nam was a tragedy.  Our brave men who fought there should be remembered.  This movie honors American youth.  It is in a league of it's own.  You cannot really compare it to any other war movie.  It stands alone.

B00000I3JM|5.0|Many years ago I received through the mail a Folk Music catalog featuring an interview with Rickie Lee Jones during her \\"Pop Pop\\" period. In the article she discussed her influences naming a lot of folk artists including \\"The Blue Nile\\". I never heard of the group, but I always respected Rickie Lee Jones creativity, therefore I bought the CD \\"Walk Across the Rooftops\\". When I first dropped it into the CD player I heard a strange rock beat with a conning male singer bouncing from one vocal range to another. It was not a trained voice, but very rough around the edges, yet emotional &amp; very human. The next song \\"Tinseltown in the Rain\\" was very `POP', danceable with a straighter beat than the pervious song. \\"This is Folk? What was Rickie Lee Jones talking about?\\"<br />After the initial shock &amp; a few more listens, I extremely fell in love with this CD. This is one of those CD's that grows on you with each listen. The inner notes did not have the words of the songs, which maybe a good thing because it forces you to pay attention. The later songs `Seem' to question God: \\"From Rags to Riches\\" &amp; \\"Easter Parade\\" &amp; mere existence: \\"Stay\\" &amp; \\"Heatwave\\".<br />\\"From Rags to Riches\\" maybe about the Jewish exodus from Egypt to the promised land with references to `Joseph's colored coat' yet at the same time about modern life with its struggles of poverty &amp; promises of riches. In some ways it's a prayer to God about what seems to be his broken promises yet seeing the glory or hope at the end of the journey.<br />\\"Stay\\" could be the typical song about a person losing a relationship, yet it works at a deeper level, maybe because of the emotional skill of the main singer Paul Buchnan.<br />\\"Easter Parade\\" is about a man who gets trapped on a street due to an Easter parade passing by. As the joy of the crowd plays on, he remembers his childhood going to church &amp; reflecting the death of Christ. One of the most moving songs on the CD when he cries, \\"I know you...\\"<br /><br />\\"Heatwave\\" returns to the `POP' mainstream beat &amp; style, but the words about the hardships of humanity keep the song above the normal top 40 mayhem.<br />\\"Automobile Noise\\" is more of an experiment with sound effects within a rock beat creating a great ending song.<br />There are hints of Thomas Dolby or maybe Pink Floyd through out this fantastic CD, yet holding on to their originality. Give it a spin....\\"<BR> <BR>\\"Heatwave\\" returns to the `POP' mainstream beat &amp; style, but the words about the hardships of humanity keep the song above the normal top 40 mayhem.   <br />\\"Automobile Noise\\" is more of an experiment with sound effects within a rock beat creating a great ending song.<br />There are hints of Thomas Dolby or maybe Pink Floyd through out this fantastic CD, yet holding on to their originality.

0156027321|4.0|When is a tiger not a tiger? Well, in Martel's Life of Pi Richard Thomas the omega big cat under the tarpaulin is very much a reality - one way or another. This story starts with a gentle reverie about how the story started &quot;because the narrator was hungry&quot;; because the author was painfully aware that his last attempt at a story structure contained not enough life to survive..And for those of us who never really grasped allegorical writing the shock when the story's tempo changes is palpable...so I asked myself &quot;when is a story not a story?&quot;..and the conundrum of Martel's story continues to unfold - or is it really snaking around you tighter and tighter?<br />The storytelling was fabulous. Martel's way of showing Pi's observations about zoo animals, about territory, about human fear and how precarious we all are is perfect for the state of play world-wide...where status, religions, alpha might and omega compliance drift endlessly along in salt seas that turn to acid baths. Are we not all in a small raft attached to a dodgy lifeboat filled with dangers and wonders?<br />The resolution for Pi to leave the island also smacked of surrealist sci-fi horror, talk about 'strange fruit'. I doubt any reader could fail to stay on to the end after witnessing the unfolding of the little orange-sized green fruits that Pi unravels.<br />This is a story for anyone who has glimpsed in moments of stress the absolute horror of human life and social arrangements. My next visit to the zoo is going to be far more observant too.
B00000I3JO|4.0|After a few years of listening to Blue Nile's 1st CD \\"Walk Across the Rooftops\\", it was a great joy to find this `hard-to-get' 2nd CD. This time around the words of the songs are simpler & very repetitive in topic. Looking at the song list are the words `Lights', `Tonight', `Headlights', `Night', & again `Night' give a clue about the poetry. Therefore I was at 1st disappointed & thought that Paul Buchanan, the main singer & song writer, already ran out of poetic ideas after a few years from his 1st stroke of genius. Yet when I told myself \\"Okay I will listen to the CD again\\" a certain calmness & a sense of `traveling through life in the big city' came across which makes this CD a must when driving on the freeway at night. Reading some of the other reviews about the beauty of uniformity with this CD over Blue Nile's 1st CD, creates several thesis/antithesis issues for me.<br /><br />Thesis: \\"Walk Across the Rooftops\\" is the better CD because it has better words, poetry, & musical experiments while it holds no common topic.<br /><br />Antithesis: \\"Hats\\" though it lacks in strength on the poetry-musical end, holds together explaining a single topic.<br /><br />Thesis: \\"Hats\\" sounds great when played with a single song, but because of the lack of poetry the total CD can sound `put together'.<br /><br />Antithesis: Because \\"Hats\\" does have a single topic, if you are in a certain mood, this CD can `hit home'.<br /><br />Sorry, no Hegelian Synthesis is allowed.

B000031WD9|1.0|I'm 20 years old and I have a very good sense of humor. I like to laugh at things that are truly funny, not stupid stuff. And this movie is definetly not funny, it's stupid. And let me get one thing straight, I'm not against tastless humor. Infact, I like sex jokes and stuff like that. I just don't like the way it's portrayed in American Pie. I simply did not find one thing amusing about this horny teen flick. What's so hilarious about seeing a boy screwing a pie? That's just ridiculous. And the scene in which a guy has sex with his friend's mom on a pool table while playing the song \\"Mrs. Kathy Robinson\\" is NOT FUNNY!!! I've seen sex comedy films that have been truly funny, but American Pie just isn't one of them.
0380713802|5.0|It can't truly be said about many authors, but Bill Bryson is laugh-out-loud funny.  Especially if you like your humor with a little edge to it.  &quot;Neither Here Nor There,&quot; was one of his travelogs that preceeded his massively sucessful &quot;A Walk in the Woods&quot; (and is now a dozen years old).  Yet it is not remotley dated.<br />The book is basically Bryson doing what he does best, bumming around a particular countryside (this time all over continental Euroope) and commenting upon everything he sees, hears, smells, tastes and touches.  He does not particularly seek out resort spots, nor would the typical tourist want to imitate his arduous treks (many of which involve endless walking).  But that's what makes his work so charming.  He travels the way most of us live, and his sense of humor is unsurpassed.<br />Overall, another winning travel book from one of the most offbeat popular writers working today.

B000002S4R|5.0|In a nutshell - this is one of the best Dutchman recordings.  Van Dam is in stupendous voice here and fully captures the tortured nature of the character.  The best sung Dutchman on disc.  Moll is without peer and makes the most of the smallish role of Daland.  Vejzovic is a vibrant, dramatically thrilling Senta, with the hint of occasional strain on high only adding to the obsessional interpretation she gives.  Hofmann is in fine form as Erik, producing an effortless stream of golden-voiced heldentenor sound.  The digital recording is demonstration quality and Karajan really delivers an electrifying reading, producing gorgeous waves of sound from the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra and Chorus.  A must have recording for Wagnerians.

With the exception of the much over-played radio faves, &quot;The Reflex&quot;, and &quot;Union of the Snake&quot;, it's a more emotional Duran than I had heard in the past.  Very good for a night alone with a glass of wine.

0783231202|3.0|This movie takes my race off the hook for slavery, sort of. Whew! Now maybe African-Americans will point their fingers at the Spanish people instead of mine. Maybe I'm seeing things, but Steven tells this story like American white people's crap smells better than everyone else who participated in slavery. Maybe I just have too many African-American friends, have heard too many stories from the mouths of their grandparents or I have read too many books. <br />I thought Steven was all into realism, but I guess not when it comes to whipping blacks. Shooting Jews is okay to present realistically, but the treatment of Black prisoners who get all upset that they can't bury their dead... They start whooping and hollering, and dancing like Shaka Zulu, but anyone who's seen any footage of the civil rights movement in the 1960's knows that they would have been beaten for their impudence. It's the Spanish who dump them overboard, but I'm supposed to believe that they wouldn't have been flogged into hamburger if they got uppity in an American prison?  I believe that kidnapped Africans took over a slave ship, because that happened. But it was a Spanish ship wasn't it? On an American ship, those Africans would have stayed put. &quot;Give us free&quot; indeed!<br />As dramas go, fine, it's good. But even I, a white guy, can see the displacement of America's part in the slave trade, legally or illegally. All the heroes of this film are white. They had Morgan Freeman for goodness sakes! He can make speeches too you know! Ever see \\"Glory\\"? <br />I am a Caucasian at grips with the history of my race in the USA. Black comedians build their careers on trash-talking white people, untalented black film makers would have no careers without us white villains, so no film about black people and their struggle here will ever make me feel guilty, and I like to think I'm not the only one. Times have changed. Humanity has matured since then, and white and black people get closer and closer with each generation as racism is slowly but surely filtered out of our respective cultures. Isn't it time for a movie that truthfully illustrates the reality and stone cold evil of the slave industry?  Not just Whites or Europeans, but blacks too?<br />This was a good Drama, and is good to get people thinking of the terrible mistakes of the past, but it doesn't truthfully present these Africans, what they had to do for their freedom and what really happened when the Americans got a hold of them. <br />Believe me; the case was not ever about the moral question of slavery and they end the story too soon, just in time to avoid the fact that Tappan and his associates tried to found an African mission, using Cinque's party as a nucleus and how Cinque had established himself as an independent power and became a successful slave trader himself.<br />This would have been a better miniseries, done by a director more compelled to tell the truth. It is a very good drama however.
0790729377|5.0|I rented this movie wanting to see what everyone was raving about. I have to say that this film was absolutely fantastic!

B00005JMFO|5.0|From the first impression many people may think that Love Actually is just another romance comedy featuring Hugh Grant. However, if you skip it because of this reason, you could have missed out an absolutely fabulous movie.<br /><br />Love Actually is a movie about love could be found everywhere.<br /><br />The movie surrounds a couple of people who so happened to be related to each other in direct or indirect ways. The stories were weaved together very skilfully that you won't find them awkward with one another and the twists of plots are very clever. This is something that one might not expect as when it comes to multiple story lines in one single plot, the screenwriter might be too busy weaving things together and it could end up with multiple linear story lines and lack the depth of the 3rd dimension. However Love Actually was very well done in terms of screenplay and giving the audience numerous surprises to keep their attention level high.<br /><br />Since the movie is a multiple storyline one, so no particular person in the cast had a heavier coverage then others, this credit has to be given to the director and the editors I suppose. It was all well balanced and at the same time the whole cast gave a superb performance. Liam Neeson who played a step-father to a 11 year old step son whose mother just passed away gave all the delicate touch in dealing with the post funeral father-son relationship. The kitchen scene with Emma Thompson was a showcase with both just let the emotion flowed naturally without any pretentious acts.<br /><br />Hugh Grant, though still look very Hugh Grant gave a very good touch as the Prime Minister of UK. This sort of fulfilled some people's fantasy of having a celebrity as the head of the nation and Hugh Grant was a very unconventional Prime Minister. The part in the press conference is a landmark for his role in the movie as he delivered his political standing with enough humour that won't be insulting but passed the message through very well.  It was very well written indeed.<br /><br />There are many other stories which gave people a lot of memorable times. The English writier (Colin Firth) and the portugese maid part was so sweet in portraying an encounter that showed both sides were perfect match for each other but they just didn't know because of the language barrier. The way they tried to overcome this language barrier without even knowing whether they are going to meet again just gave the movie a very sweet and warm touch.<br /><br />The rock star part provided a huge injection of humour to the moive. And on the other hand the two subtle triangular relationships, one remained subtle and the other became a hidden current undermining the establishment also smartly showed how people deal with relationships when it comes to something that nobody wanted to happen.<br /><br />The actors stand-ins and the desinger and clerk parts were also very interesting.<br /><br />Love Actually is actually a movie of choice for the year. Like Amelie, it is a feel good movie and you would be able to enjoy it from the beginning till the very end. It has a superb cast, it was cleverly done and also it has a soundtrack that fits into the movie perfectly. It is a movie that gave the word Love a fair definition. It covers all the happy, sad and depressing situations of relationship, but at the same time it gives you the energy to stay in the relationship no matter what. If you are looking for a movie that you could enjoy for 2 hours and then after that still feel good when you think about it again, Love Actually is a definite choice.through very well.

B00005K9OX|5.0|Don't make the same mistake that I made.  Don't wait very long to watch this film, especially if you love those movies were things go &quot;boom.&quot;<br />Die Hard is just that kind of movie, and it's done in such a way that puts the many action movies being put out following it to shame.<br />If you're a fan of the modern action flicks, then Die Hard sounds like old hat.  A group of international terrorists, with one goal in mind and a bunch of hostages that will be their ticket to that goal.  Only one man can stop them.<br />The joy of this movie is that it seems every person who speaks in this movie is just as important as the main one, John McClane (Bruce Willis).  Most characters have their own little quirks, and even the cronie terrorists seem to have a personality, something that you'll likely never see in action movies these days.<br />McClane is a New York City cop entering the confusing atmosphere of Los Angeles, traveling to see his wife who had traveled out here to capitalize on a big promotion.  Accompanied to the large building by Argyle (De'voreaux White in an unappreciated role, no doubt), McClane makes his entrance to the Christmas party.  After finding that his wife has returned to her maiden name of Gennero, McClane meets with Mrs. McClane (Bonnie Bedelia), but the reunion is short-lived and rather unsatisfactory.  As John kicks himself mentally, the terrorists make their entrance, led by a character later to be revealed as Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman).  From there, the movie lifts your spirits up, crushes them down, and then repeats.  When it's all said and done, you'll have wrapped up quite the satisfying movie experience.<br />Looking back on this movie 16 years after its initial release, it's easy to pass this off as a stereotypical movie.  However, this movie created the stereotype of the daring hero who will never say die, the cunning terrorists who will send wave after wave of big, bulky thugs to take down the protagonist.<br />When you seethis movie, you'll truly appreciate the action genre again.  This movie was created in 1988, but it could easily pass for today's standards, and probably would bank some good money if given a re-release to the big screen (iMAX, anyone?).<br />Perhaps it's not worth a second look after your first viewing, since there isn't really much to pick up on in a second viewing, except truly sitting back and enjoying just how well this movie &quot;clicked.&quot;<br />However, for now all you can hope for is a big spankin' plasma TV, which is just as good to view this action classic.<br />Rooting for the good guy has never been so much fun.
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|More of the same from the strokes, but who said that was a bad thing? The only problem with the strokes is that while every song on this album is strong, they all tend to blend in with each other.
B0000057C5|1.0|This CD tends to get a little weary aside from the hit single off of it, which is only so good to begin with.  Industrial is a pretty dirty style of music if you ask me, unless it is done properly as is done by Econoline Crush, Gravity Kills, or Nine Inch Nails (that is, their song &quot;Perfect Drug&quot;, since everything else they do is awful).  Rammstein, unfortunately, has a sort of roughness that isn't of any real value.  They're typical of the myriad bands that sound hard but have nothing of substance behind the gutteral &quot;singing&quot;.  I say that this should be skipped over, perhaps in favor of a Mudvayne CD, where the makeup isn't to shock you into pulling out your wallet so much as it is a way to underscore the music (the cover on this CD may be tempting for the casual poser, so I had to include that).
B0000C6E4D|2.0|Usually, when an artist takes a few years off, they come back with rejuvenated ideas, electrically fresh lyrics, and juicy melodies and rhythms.  Sadly, I don't think this is the case for Afterglow.  I have long been an admirer or Sarah's music, and have enjoyed watching her style and music evolve over the years.  Afterglow lacks the diversity and philosophical musings pervasive in all of her other albums (Although it did take me awhile to warm up to Surfacing).  Her Lyrics are repedative and redundant (Count how many times the theme of fire, falling, or self deprication comes up.  It seemed as though she stopped being an artist who bore witness to the swirlings of the external world (World is on Fire, excluded), and stayed focused on her internal battles / neurosis.  That said, her voice is as beautiful as ever, and her band is tight (albeit over-produced).  Though there are a few jewels hiding within this album, I find it hard to believe that an artist who took a 5-year haitus didn't come back with better stories.
0452282152|5.0|I've read all of Chevalier's books, and this is by far her best work. It's a real page turner - I finished it in one night!
0743200799|5.0|Gene Kranz's book tells a similar story, as told in books by Eugene Cerman, Scott Carpenter, and Chris Kraft, without being dominated by the author's ego.  The others wrote good books.  But Kranz avoids using personal attacks to tell his tale.  The antidotes differ from those in other stories, as Kranz does not have a Boy Scout image to preserve.  However, Kranz covers mission control only through Apollo 17.<br />This book is an excellent story of the space race from the ground.
B00008PX8P|5.0|....disregard the last idiot from Auburn's pointless slander review. Yes, I said idiot, because even non-Zeppelin fans often recognize and respect the bands scope of influence and impact. This moron is far too ignorant to understand that probably 80% of the &quot;hip and current&quot; crap he listens to(which probably includes Disturbed, Puddle of Mudd, 3 Doors Down and other earsores) would not exist had it not been for this extraordinary band. And since when is a band's age have anything to do with musical longevity(&quot;Only old people remember Led Zeppelin&quot;)? Oh well, enjoy whatever tripe mainstream radio tells you is &quot;rocking&quot;, you loser.<br />Now onto the dvd....it is simply what we've been waiting for. Raw, rugged, aggressive and intense, it highlights a period in rock music far more exciting and fun than any overhyped garage rock today can put forth. Seeing the intensity of the live Zeppelin experience is unforgettable, from Bonzo's frenetic drumming, to Page's painful dark blues riffs, to Jonesy's solid bass and keyboard work and Plant's strong vocals. This is a must for any fan and some of the best live footage of any band, anywhere.
B0000A02TZ|1.0|Thanks to the other reviews here I now know not to buy this DVD.  Forcing you to watch a ton of commercials every single time you put the disc in your player is apalling.  Stay away from Universal's DVDs unless they knock it off.  If you're the type of person who loves having an inbox full of spam, you should enjoy this DVD.

B000002UJQ|5.0|I have had a slight familiarity with Radiohead, via friends & MTV, over the past 11 years.  For some reason I decided to pick up OK Computer from the library.  I purchased my own copy two days later after listening to it nearly continuously.  I remember all of the \\"rave reviews\\" this album got when it was first released, I had no idea how true they were.  The musical textures are like an oil slick, reflecting rainbows with indiscernable depth.  This album is an album.  A CD to be listened to in its entirity.  I place this CD next to Pet Sounds-Beach Boys, Revolver-Beatles, Dark Side of the Moon-Pink Floyd, No Code-Pearl Jam, Midnight Vultures-Beck, Righteous Love-Joan Osborne, Electric Ladyland-Jimi Hendix & Time Out of Mind-Bob Dylan.  Real albums, that record a moment in time, a state of mind, a level of emotion that defies words & defines our own humanity.  Such personal unrest that requires music to be written and played by a person/persons to maintain/attain sanity.  Music like this reminds me that I am human and not a machine. God bless the children.
B000001FOS|5.0|Questo CD  forse una delle produzioni piu' belle del grande chitarrista, che emerse alla grande con le sue soluzioni barocche nel primo valevole album &quot;Rising Force&quot;, ma che poi si  andato sempre pi aggrappando (forse disperatamente) a queste stesse soluzioni, che si traducono praticamente in circa 10 album, stilisticamente uno fotocopia dell'altro. Questo Odyssey invece  tutt'altra storia, brioso e arieggiato grazie ai testi e alle belle melodie di Joe Lynn Turner che sicuramente apporta una &quot;botta de vita&quot; a tutto quanto. I virtuosismi di Malmsteen sono sempre presenti, ma in questo caso sono perfettamente integrati in melodie originali ora malinconiche, ora struggenti ora grintose, aggiungendo al gi elevato phatos uno splendido tocco di tecnicismo mai gratuito o scontato. Peccato che la megalomania di Malmsteen (e forse la paura di non brillare pi da solo nel suo gruppo), abbia portato alla rapida esclusione di Turner dalle successive formazioni (e dai suoi album), e quindi ad un decadimento a picco dell'originalit delle sue successive composizioni che (anche se bisogna dire presentano qualche volta qualche spunto originale) risentono di una farraginosit di note e scale armoniche &quot;da manuale&quot;, che sebbene da un punto di vista strettamente estetico possano far la loro bella figura, riducono a mio avviso il tutto, ad una serie di CD &quot;Come imparare a suonare la chitarra come Malmsteen&quot;. In conclusione, questo Odyssey  IMPERDIBILE.
B00003CXI1|4.0|After much hype and anticipation, the whimsical world of Harry Potter is finally brought to life on the big screen in its first feature film. When Warner Brothers bought the rights to the famous children's book series, millions waited in utter anticipation for the adaptation of the first book and executives at the studio were just biting at the bit to accept the money of Mr. Potter's legion of loyal fans. But this was far from an easy task for the movie studio. Why? In order to produce a magnificent achievement for the paying customers, the movie must remain true (to an extent) to the books created by J.K. Rowling and the whimsy and fantasy of those tales must remain no matter the cost. For if this does not happen, Warner Brothers executives can kiss those potential profits on sequels good-bye.<br />The story focuses on the adventures of a young boy in England who discovers he is actually a wizard in training and that he is to be taken to a school, far from the world of the muggles (or non-magical folk) that he has grown up with all his life. After losing his parents when he was a baby, Harry Potter now resides with his terrible adopted family that consists of his boorish uncle, his snippy aunt, and spoiled, brutish cousin. But one day, he learns that he has been accepted to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. When he arrives in the magic world of wizards and witches, he is overwhelmed to find out that he is one of the most famous sorcerers of all time m due to his confrontation, and evidential defeat of, the evil Lord Voldemort as a baby. But he no sooner puts he foot through the door then the trouble starts, whether it be the up-tight Professor Snape or the spoiled Draco Malfroy. After many strange events around the school, it is up to Harry and his new friends to stop an evil creature from stealing the Sorcerer's Stone which could bring about the re-generation of Lord Valdemort. The story for Harry Potter &amp; the Sorcerer's Stone is done marvelouslywell but not based on material from the book. When going to see this film, don't go into it basing it on the book. You'll only be left with disappointment.<br />Though most of the performances were played out by young actors and actresses, those performances were done in such a way that they were sophisticated for the age of the performers and therefore surprising. Daniel Radcliffe fits perfectly into the lead role of Harry Potter but the real determining factor will be if Radcliffe can keep that outstanding persona in this role as he matures through the sequels. Overall the performers seem well suited to their roles but that is not fully realized in the beginning. Only over a period of time in the film do the actors feel fully comfortable in their roles. The only disappointment has to be with John Cleese's Sir Nicholas, which was shown as nearly as much as he probably should have been.<br />Overall, the mystical and extraordinary world of Harry Potter is brought to life in a way that many wouldn't have thought possible years ago and, though the film may differ from the book from time to time, even the most hardcore of Potter followers will be happy with this first film adaptation. Not to say it is absolutely perfect, there are some minor things to complain about. The time length, which stood at two hours and thirty minutes, seemed way too long for a feature at younger children. Granted they probably won't care too much since their eyes will be glued to the screen but that can problem based on potty breaks or something to that effect. Another problem deals with the editing of the movie. As an example, the burnt roof of Hogwarts that was not present in one scene was shown in the next with no explanation to what happened. But outside of those small problems, Harry Potter &amp; the Sorcerer's Stone is a delightful treat during the holiday season but not near the same level as Disney/Pixar's Monsters Inc. but a great film none the less.
B0000CGV00|5.0|This is such an involving listening experience that it seems odd that more classical music CDs don't borrow the approach espoused here. Rather than a disc dominated by one composer, certainly the norm, we get something more closely approximating a recital, a very adventurous one at that, which links composers and pieces that at first glance would seem to have relatively little in common. Part of the joy for the listener is sensing and identifying points of connection among the pieces and finding different ways to listen than perhaps would be in evidence if all the music had come from the same composer. What makes this work a success, however, is Grimaud, who sounds thoroughly at ease and confident in this mixed repertoire. Though she looks delicate, she can pound and thunder with the best (or worst) of them and it is to her credit here that she holds her sometimes tendency to overstate a phrase well in check. She sounds very relaxed, like she is having fun exploring the music, and her interpretations of the Beethoven pieces have a freshness and immediacy that is just thoroughly and immediately engaging. Might be the best classical music CD released this year.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|Goodness gracious. Why'd it take so long? The first season is just now coming out after four seasons? Smallville's already been released for goodness sakes!

B00009W0U4|4.0|As a young female I found &quot;Irreversible&quot; just about the most disturbing experience of my life (not counting my bad drug trip).  I was literally traumatized to the point where I thought I might need to start taking anti-psychotics or seek out some therapy of some sort.  Fortunately those feelings have begun to fade, one week after I've viewed the film, and I REALLY don't want to watch it again!  Well, yeah I do, but it'd be akin to wanting to be stabbed in the side of the head.  If you're curious as to just how shocking &quot;Irreversible&quot; can be, here's how shocking:  AHHHHHHHHHHH!  It will make you want to scream at the world.  It will make you sit in the dark at night shaking back and forth.  It will make you want to sleep just so your mind will be quiet.  Proceed with caution!  Now that that's out of the way, &quot;Irreversible&quot; is a great film due to its a) improvisational acting b)storyline c)direction and editing.  It's a goodish film mostly because its ending is too abrupt and doesn't completely deliver on the tagline: &quot;Time destroys everything.&quot;  See it, by all means, if you can deal with the emotional debilitation that will follow.<BR>  <BR>PS: Monica Bellucci, you need a BIG hug.
B0001BKAEE|5.0|This is one of the greatest sci-fi action films i've seen in years. If you enjoyed the &amp;quot;The Matrix&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The Matrix Reloaded&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Revolutions&amp;quot; will blow you away. It's an exellent ending to the matrix trilogy with outragious humor and dazzling visual effects with the most exciting ending you've ever seen. I highly reccomend it.

B00013PHGS|5.0|I can't remember the last album I've listened to where I loved every song... maybe Ok Computer by Radiohead... so that was years ago... this album is just amazing, and is like that... from the first track to the last, it maintains such high standards, that I'm just blown away... especially since I never really got into Moon Safari, Air's supposed &quot;best&quot; album... <br />this one is jam packed with really engaging melodies... and that's the real important thing isn't it? The melody is really where the emotion is... I find the album really spacious, and you can hear all the instruments, and it's just so gentle... but it's always engaging... just gorgeous music is what it is... a lot of the songs have a slightly melencholic feel to them, but the albums leaves you feeling positive... <br />what can I say, I just love this... it's one of the best albums I've heard in a nice while! The DVD looks real cool too!
B0000AUHPG|5.0|Director Sergio Leone presents &quot;Once Upon A Time In The West&quot; a 1967 original uncut (165 minutes) masterpiece is a momumental western epic.

Jason Robards plays a half breed falsely accused of that terrible slaughter.  Charles Bronson plays &quot;Harmonica&quot; the man seeking revenge remembering how his brother was savagely tortured by Frank.  And Claudia Cardinale the widow who holds what Frank wants.  <br />This classic western is presented for the first time on a 2 DVD set with digitally remastered video and 5.1 Surround Sound in WideScreen Format (enhanced for 16:9 HDTV).

0385504209|4.0|I enjoyed this book until about halfway through.  The writing is good, the suspense is maintained and the author has researched his conspiracy theories. But the writer lost all credibility with me, and insulted my intelligence as a reader, when the supposed academic-in-the-field-of-Holy-Grail-lore takes a look at some writing that will supposedly help reveal the location of the Grail.  Langdon decides it must be a Semitic language with which he isn't familiar.  Now, anyone with the most remote  familiarity with Arabic or Hebrew script could tell you that it bears not the SLIGHTEST RESEMBLANCE TO SEMITIC SCRIPT OF ANY SORT.  If Langdon had experience researching the Holy Grail, surely he would have at least SEEN things written in Hebrew and Aramaic.  A cursory examination of the writing (say, 15 seconds) will make it obvious that it's actually inverted English.  That's right, go hold it up to a mirror.  Surely a professor and symbologist should be able to see this.<br />After that, it was more difficult to maintain the suspension of disbelief required for conspiracy theory novels.
B0001611DI|5.0|This is absolutely awsome!. I'm soooo glad the waiting is finally over. At last, George Romero's most influentiual and wildly popular horror film ever made is back on DVD, loaded with lots of extra footage and mastered with DiViMax. I just want to say, this is a must for every horror fan to see, especially if you are a zombie movie lover. I just hope the coming up remake is as good as this one and packed with an onslaught of gut-wrenching-flesh-eaters and exploding heads scenes; I guess we will find out at the movies next month. In the mean time, if you are a horror movie lover, don't hesitate to buy this DVD, JUST DO IT!.

I only wish that they will tour the US soon!<br />Simply Elegant!
0448060191|5.0|Little Women gives you a little show of what life was really like back in the 1860's. There is a lot of love through out this book. You will meet in the beginning four young ladies and get to see what it was like for them to grow up during the war. While reading this book you will meet Amy, Meg, Beth and Jo. You will get to take adventures with Jo and see what it was like for her to br a tomboy, a writer, and an older sister. I love this book because it shows love and pasion within this one little family of five. If you enjoy reading Little Women, two other books also written by Louisa May Alcott are, Little Men and Jo's Boys.
B00005ASHM|1.0|Ok, here's the deal: every major artist and most of the minor ones since 1965 have been the progeny of 4 artists, or more specifically, four albums:  Beach Boys' Pet which really isn't Beach Boys but Brian Wilson and Friends, Beatles' White Album (which isn't their best record, but we're not talking about great music here, we're talking about influential music.  There's a difference.  Do yourself a favor and learn it.  <BR>Too many music critics forget to and it spoils good things.)  Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, and James Brown's Live at the Apollo.   These four albums are the Earth, Wind, Fire and Water of modern music.  Everything that comes after them is some combination, some mix of two or three or most likely all four.  These albums define modern music.  (You ask, how can I leave out Elvis, but what is Elvis?  He is large parts James Brown, tempered by Pet Sounds and seasoned by Dylan.  Timeline doesn't matter.  Music doesn't exist in time.  That's what it is.)<br />Pet Sounds is Platonic Pop.  It is sweet, it is seamless, it is innocent even in its complexity.  It's musically challenging but utterly accessible.  It's so darn friendly.  It's letterman jacket teenagers who respect their parents and marry their girlfriends. That's not dated or fifties; those kids still exist in the 21st century and their music is directly descended from this album.  What Paul McCartney heard when he heard this record was the sound of Pop, which never before had crystallized in such a way.  And if it was up to Paul, the Beatles would have been Pop, and would've gone pop.  Thank God it wasn't, and rock was invented.  <br />Ok, so we've established it's influential.  That's a given.  What that does not mean, dear reader is that it's actually any good.  In the end, it's still pop, and pop is still the most soulless element of music.  I have to wonder what state music would be in without this fourth element.  Would Michael Bolton be singing in Holiday Inns instead of Carnegie Hall?  Or would pop have been born anyway, later, with less force and art?  This album bores me after the first time through: it's just TOO accessible to be worth much time or effort.  Can it be art if it's all surface?  Maybe.  If  it ever can, it is here -- I'll give it that.  But like an stripper who tries to convince me she's a dancer, I'm afraid the entire endeavour may be doomed from the beginning.  <br />I'm skeptical of any album on which the best songs are the ones I heard on the radio -- though, 'tis true, radio is the mistress of pop -- because for good artists, making songs \\"radio-friendly\\" means compromise (hence great artists, who won't compromise, are never on the radio.)  Here, I come back to Sloop John B and God Only Knows and Wouldn't it be nice, and I'm a little afraid it's because they were on the oldies station when I was a kid, riding in the backseat of a station wagon in cutoffs on the way to the swimming hole.  More nostalgia than appreciation.  The Beach Boys make a pretty penny off nostalgia -- look them up in a department store and you'll find this album and then nothing but collections - greatest hits, summer sounds, typical commercial repackaging for people who don't care about music, just want to sing or hear something pretty and/or nostalgic.  Not art.  <br />Head on My Shoulder may be the best romantic song ever written, simply for the purity of it -- who else but the  inventor of pop could write such romance without a hint, not even a hint of sex in it?  True pop doesn't know sex exists.  Much of the album -- I Just Wasn't Made for These Times, That's Not Me, You Still Believe in Me, I Know There's an Answer -- is either touchingly or cloyingly moral, depending on your level of jade.  <br />Ultimately, it's like discovering any real source of anything -- not so impressive unless you're really aware of what came after and why.  I could do without this album, but I don't think the world could.
B00005JM1F|5.0|\\"Old School\\" is the clear and obvious best comedy of 2003, hands down. I actually saw it in the theater four times - yes, that's four - mostly because I kept going out with people that hadn't seen it yet. Every experience was the same - the theater was locked in hysterics for the duration of the movie, from the opening scene.<br />But as I watched the movie again and again, I began to really feel cheated by the ending. Up until this point it's a quasi-reality based film, with somewhat believable characters. Then at the end it turns into a 1980s Donner film, where a 400-pound kid is suddenly endowed with the ability to flip through the air like an Olympic gymnast, and Will Ferrell's character begins speaking expertly about a political topic he knows nothing about, actually stumping James Carville. I understand it's just a silly comedy, but up until this point everything was just funny and true - it felt very \\"hand of God\\"-ish. <br />However it only weakens the movie slightly, and even within these unconvincing moments it's still very funny. Buy it. You will watch it again and again. The bonus features are great, including a spoof of the Actor's Studio with Will Ferrell as James Lipton interviewing the entire cast. There are tons of one-liners, the cast is great, and it defines Will Ferrell as the comedic genius of this generation.
B000008JGI|5.0|First off, Echoes is one of my favorite songs of all time.  It's a slowly starting and medium paced song (drawn out to the 23 minute mark) that is just amazing.  It starts out with quietly sounding sonar piano sounds and guitar, going through the introduction, then the guitar tears through the song and just takes off, but in perfect coordination with the rest of the instruments.  It's almost as if the guitar starts playing something different from what the other instruments are playing, but listen to the song a few more times and you'll see that it fits so well.  You will definitely feel a need to listen to &quot;Echoes&quot; many times, it's something that just doesn't get old.  The lyrics are kind of sparse given the song's length (like most Floyd songs, this is an instrumental with lyrics, not a pop-song with a refrain), but there is one line that just sticks to my mind &quot;Strangers passing in the street/ By chance two separate glances meet/ And I am you and what I see is me.&quot;   It always makes me wonder what were they thinking when they wrote that.  There is a point before the ending that slows down to really creepy sea-bird sounds.  Sounds like an insane albatross in heat.  If the band left this 4 minute section out, the song wouldn't be any worse off and I sometimes fast-forward through it if I've got someone else (a non-Floyd enthusiast) in my car listening (they usually are a little scared by this part of the song).  However, after a while, it sort of grew on me to the point where I have come to appreciate this part as an essential part of &quot;Echoes.&quot;  The ending is fantastic, with the guitar slowly gearing up to sear through your head one triumphant time with the sonar piano backing at just the right places.  At the end of the track, there's an overlayed wind sound and the instruments slow to a halt.  Always leaves me wanting more.  The songs &quot;One of These Days,&quot; &quot;Fearless&quot; and &quot;Pillow of Winds&quot; are all great songs too.  Cool chord work in &quot;Fearless.&quot;  Almost blues, more country-like guitar picking in &quot;Pillow of Winds.&quot;  &quot;One of These Days&quot; really rocks at the end.  &quot;Seamus&quot; and &quot;San Tropez&quot; are bearable, that's all.  The good news it that the bad moments total less than six minutes of the album.  &quot;Seamus&quot; (2:12 minutes) is an uninspired number that merely showcases Rick Wright's &quot;talking&quot; dog that punctuates every other own-beat with a shrill bark.  &quot;San Tropez&quot; (3:40 min) is kind of like an effortless country romp that sounds as though it was conceived as a transition between the beautiful acoustic strumming of &quot;Fearless&quot; and the yipping dog sounds of &quot;Seamus.&quot;  I can't, for all I listen to Meddle, come to like either &quot;San Tropez&quot; or &quot;Seamus.&quot;<br />A word on MFSL gold discs:  The issue of Meddle that you find stocked in stores under the Capitol label comes from a machine that reads from tapes that are copied from copies of the copy of the master tape.  Actually, I have no idea about the specifics, but the end result is the same: the characteristic hiss from an old, decomposed tape that overlays every minute of the CD.  It's on all the standard aluminum CDs out there and it's more pronounced the older the album is.  What Mobil Fidelity Sound Labs did was to make a copy from the original master tape.  They proceeded to remaster this and make it even better until they put it on a gold CD and called it an ultradisc.  New, they run in the hundreds (yes I said triple digits) of dollars.  Some believe that they are worth this.  I will not say that I would pay $200 for a CD.  However, I would pay the $30-60 they go for used.  Keep in mind that they sold for $200 new, so the original owner isn't likely to have spilled soda on this CD or dropped it on gravel or something.  <br />When I first got mine (used), I was blown away.  The tape-hiss is GONE.  Turn it up all the way and all you hear are the instruments, no accompanying &quot;Ssssssss&quot; AT ALL!!!  The highs are more defined and much crisper for this reason.  The experience is like listening to music in a car with the sunroof open for all your life and suddenly the sunroof is closed.  The lows, while not lower, are less mushy (not that they were very mushy at all to begin with, but there is a slight improvement nonetheless).  This CD is worth the $30-60 you pay for it used, especially if you hate the tape-hiss as much as I do.
