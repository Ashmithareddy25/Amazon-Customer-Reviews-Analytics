B006JD48NM|4.0|You don't have to be a true car nut or racing fan to enjoy this film.  It shows more than just racing but what it takes to be a pure race driver.  It doesn't take long for you to start recognizing Senna's love for his sport and doing it for the purity of it almost to a fault.  The passion Senna showed in driving and winning showed how he was one of the greatest drivers of his time and not just a good race driver.  Driving to the extreme all the time was like food for Senna.  He did it to live.  Yet near the end of his life you could also see that he did not want to be in his car at his last race.  It was subtle but through the helmet eye opening, you could see it in his eyes.
B001HN6918|5.0|Grandkids loved the first one and I just knew that I had to get the second one. I wasn't disappointed, it's great and they loved it!
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|The American version is so much more intense and suspenseful than the original version.  Slight differences in the endings between the two but nothing to affect the movie.  Definitely worth the price of admission and adding to your DVD collection for those who do that kind of thing.  I can't wait for the next movie in the series and hopefully with the continuation of the actors in the main roles.  The only problem now is the waiting for it to come out.
B004L3AR0K|5.0|I certainly didn't expect this movie to be as powerful as it turned out to be. It really is a great show. Not for the little viewers because of all the skin, but it's a well written show!
B002RSDW80|4.0|The interplay between the Julie and Julia's characters is both funny and revealing.  It shows a lot about how two different people approached life and solved the problems they faced.  Meryl Streep is again amazing at how she loses herself in the character.  This is worth buying just to see her portrayal of Julia Child but the whole cast lends works in making this movie a little hidden gem to brighten anyones day.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|This is a GREAT show! I bought this thinking it was going to be a yawner, but was pleasantly surprised. Great show of a great story performed by great professionals.
B00AESN8XY|2.0|The game itself is great.  Issue I have is twice I've beat the game on normal as bacteria, but it had failed to recognize as such and will not unlock virus mode.  very frustrating!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game Is amazing, if you enjoy mystery of \\"find objects\\" type games this is an absolute must!!! The graphics are crisp and clear, and The gameplay is addicting. Way too much fun for free:) Check it out you won't be sorry!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|You will be ravenous while reading this book. I highly, highly recommend it. John Green has a way of making you fall in love with his characters and Fault is no exception.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|It's an interesting game. It reminds me of Ispy. It's a great game considering it is free. So far, there's no glitches.
B004LWZW7E|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when I first saw the reviews. The trailer looked awesome but the reviews were \\"meh.\\" I wasn't disappointed though. I'm glad I watched and I'll be purchasing the DVD for my personal collection.<br /><br />This film was full of action and suspense- but it also contained a message: what would happen to the system if everyone, both rich and poor, were on equal footing? This film shows the answer.<br /><br />This film was the quintessential Bonnie and Clyde meets Robin Hood. Justin Timberlake and Amanda Syfried play an awesome couple battling the corruption of a system run by the rich on the backs of the suffering poor.<br /><br />I recommend this film to anyone looking for a fun watch on the weekend.
0312330537|5.0|loved this book, an epic story with interesting characters, lots of great lines, gritty and exotic.  it meanders and has some weird and difficult things in it, but it's really ultimately a very personal story of love and values and redemption
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great for when you are feeling a little lonely and it's raining outside so you can't walk the chinchilla, or the toaster watching is getting too intense to handle because you think that the wrong bread will pop up first... yikes..
0596101996|4.0|totally got me up to speed on javascript, clearly written and lots of good details as usual for an O'reilly book
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Have not used it.  I don't think the first grader has either.  Can not judge it at this time.  May be fun
B007VUA7VO|5.0|a great resource. gives info on battery life for specific uses (like reading, games, Internet, etc) instead of the battery icon.
B008N1V11U|4.0|Not really for a first grader he gets angery with the process of the game.  I think he is to young for it but his dad lets him watch the junk on tv
B0076DELIG|2.0|Harry Bosch is an interesting character and I always enjoy his perspective but this is just a formula mystery plot and rather dull. No surprises. The best parts were Bosch's interactions with his daughter. Michael Connelly can do better.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|of course the best.  We have it on the phones for the grandson.  He has been using the  game since 4 years old
B000VIK8D0|5.0|A more historically accurate version of the Wyatt Earp saga.  Less of the Hollywood glitter, I got a better sense of how and why he was what he was. I am a retired sheriff, I know how it feels to be the only one standing in the way, I got that same feeling with this movie.
B0086700CM|3.0|My grandson has not used the game yet And I do not know anything about it.  I would prefer peace and harmony as a reward.
B004LROUNG|4.0|I have read 6 or 7 other Grisham books and this one did not disappoint. It was a bit lighter on intrigue than some of his classics, but I found it kept my attention the whole way through and was enjoyable to read. I could see this premise and these characters making a good sit-com, though the book is not a comedy.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|All the cities that I am interested in came up on the app.  Graphics are really neat with the changing weather.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't even know where to start.  This was an incredible book and I can't wait to read more from Colleen Hoover.  I admit that it was slow to catch me, but when it did, I was hooked.  Colleen does an incredible job of making you feel what the characters are going through.  I don't usually boo hoo during books, but this was so well written and Colleen pulled at my heartstrings....so I definitely teared up.  I would honestly recommend this book to anyone that likes to read, no matter what your favorite genre is...this book will touch your heart.
B0063IH60K|3.0|As we go down the road we us the game to play cards it is ok to pass the time
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I purchased this eight Blu-ray DVD Harry Potter set and it arrived on time, which was before Christmas. I was extremely happy to see that I have been upgraded, at no charge, to the 11 disc set. The seller did an excellent job. I will definitely give them my business in the future
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|Lost flow and excitement of previous movies! Scripted more like a television show than a hollywood production.<br />Dialog also seemed rushed
0545265355|5.0|This classic trilogy by Suzanne Collins is one of my wife's favorites. We were able to get it before Christmas, in flawless packaging, and at a great price. I will definitely purchase from this seller again
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A wonderful use of symbolism and overall a literary work of art. I loved the book from the first word to the last and everywhere in between.
B00133KHCY|5.0|If you love music and believe in the power of music, you have to watch this movie! Its absolutely amazing!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Good book I think this is enough words wait no it's not so... go cubs. I eat tooth paste. Bye
B005CGI4EG|2.0|Before I start my review, I should say that the show itself is excellent. It's one of my favorites and one of few I actually find funny. Based off of this, I would give this product a 5/5 rating, however, the packaging is a big concern and is why my score is so low.<br /><br />Essentially, the people that produced this made a big box and stuffed all the discs from the individual sets into it. When opening the box, discs easily fall out and there are only two open spaces to keep them where you have to put them one on top of another, which can lead to scratches. It's a hassle to find a specific disc and some (season 2) don't even have a season on the disc itself, so if you accidentally forget the order, you're pretty much out of luck for continuity purposes unless you want to put the disc in just to see what season it is. There's also no manual of any sort to tell you episodes, order, or anything else you may want to know. I've also heard that certain episodes are syndicated, although this was apparently a problem on the individual sets as well.<br /><br />Although the price is very good for what you get (~$30 for a full series is really great when compared to a lot of others out there), I would recommend getting the individual sets assuming they're the same and as cheap or cheaper.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book was great couldn't stop reading. Suggested for all readers. Bitter sweet story with tragedy and a lot of detail.
B00A6N8F4Y|2.0|Not sure if this was an attempt at making a modern day Pulp Fiction, if so the goal was not achieved. The acting was poor and the plot was lacking....enough said.
B00AE2IJIE|4.0|The story was not quite what I expected but it was not bad and I do want to see it again.
B007SGM084|3.0|Has a creative writing. The sex scenes are descriptive, the main characters are well thought and i find the theme interesting
B001D57C0C|4.0|As someone who has come into this genre through very windy paths, my opinion may not be as valued as people who are devoted to it. My music run the gamut from classical to New Age to pop to rock, even a little nu metal (or whatever it's called). This is the second album I've bought by Within Temptation. The first one I bought The Heart of Everything is better than The Silent Force, I think. There's more variety in the songs, and I just found it more compelling. That said, I still have really enjoyed The Silent Force as well.<br /><br />I've read enough reviews on these to know that I might get skewered for this, but having listened to Delain and Evanescence, I find Within Temptation to be on par, perhaps a little bit better than Evanescence, and pretty much equal in quality with Delain.
B003TSEEDY|2.0|This was a very interesting book. Charlie vaguely reminded me of Holden Caulfield from the catcher in the rye. Charlie by far was the strangest character I had ever come across. He cried all the time. There a lot of unanswered questions. Why did he cry all the time? What was he being institutionalized for? Why did he have no friends his own age? Did his aunt Helen molest him? Why would he wake up naked at random places and not remember how he got there? Did he suffer from autism, or schizophrenia? This book left too much up for interpretation for my taste.
0060254920|5.0|Where the WIld Things Are takes a glimpse into  child's imagination as he responds to being punished for behaving so &#34;wild&#34;.  The simple text is accompanied by Maurice Sendack's fantastical illustrations of the &#34;wild things&#34; who fall under the little boy's control and are a delight to view. This story is an essential book for every pre-schooler's home library.  My son, who loved being read this tale when he was three years old, now reads it to his own children who receive it with the same level of enthusiasm as their daddy did twenty five years ago.  Buy it and enjoy it with your children over and over again!
B00A7ZWUJC|1.0|Disappointed. I LOVED her last album. This one was nothing like it. Unapologetic is definetly the tone for the whole thing. : (  very hard core
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book weaves the feeling  of the characters into a mesmerizing tale of desperation.  The end was very sudden yet leaves the reader wanting to know more.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|I really wanted to love this book, and went back and forth between really enjoying it and really being aggravated by it. First of all, this story felt very drawn out to me, and while the story of Sky forgetting her memories of being abused was unique, I didn't like how the author played out her finding out, and the situations the happened after. It all seemed so rushed after the majority of the book being slow and confusing. I enjoyed Holder and Sky's relationship but even there I felt like the book could've used more of them just being a couple. Maybe it's just me but the whole story of the lead female being sexually abused when they're younger is becoming so common in romance novels now a days, that it's becoming quite repetitive. I don't like reading about it in other books when it's not such a big factor but in this book there are flashbacks, that I couldn't even read, and then an entire scene where Sky talks to her father aka her rapist and he actually talks about why he did it and how he did it to other little girls. Then it's brought up yet again with her \\"mom\\" talking about how she was a victim as well. It was just to much child molestation crammed in to the last 20% of a long book that ruined it for me.
B004JN1CW4|2.0|SPOILER alert do not read this if you plan to read the book<br /><br />Why did Teresa have to die saving Thomas? It would of been better if it was Brenda. Thomas and Teresa should have made up and both went through the portal with or without Brenda. Also it made it feel like beet the crank wasn't dead considering that Thomas closed his eyes when he shot and never looked if he hit him. Another crank could of got in the way. Of course he ended up dying shot or not shot because he was a crank. Also what happened to the communes that wicked didn't capture? Surely the cranks didn't kill them all. That means there would be other people that were immune scattered all over and Minho, Brenda, Jorge, Tom and the 200 Werner the only survivors.
0545265355|1.0|I purchased the item with optimism thanks to the review from Stephen King, an author who I have profound respect for. If you have read more than a handful of books I would warn you that the bland and predictive storyline will test your patience. The most frustrating aspect of this trilogy was that the author surely knew that the story was weak as she used the protagonist to keep the reader \\"intrigued\\" by her constantly stating \\"I am going to kill myself\\", although the story is told from her perspective. At the risk of rambling on I will leave it at that. Please don't give a poor author more money by purchasing this item, you would be best reading...I don't know, The Hungry Caterpillar.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|As usual, Follett is able to blend history and fiction into a wonderful book. Nowhere in its 900-plus pages, does it loose focus on the main theme. You will not find yourself rushing through pages to get back to the main thesis. Every page is intriguing and relevant to the story.<br /><br />The only bad thing is: It ends. I can’t wait for Book-3! Really.
B002W6Z0UK|5.0|My daughter in law is a huge fan of Lady GaGa but had none of her cd's. Hopefully this is the beginning of her collection
B00APUYWYA|1.0|The language was foul.  I sure wouldn't let my kids watch this movie.  Why do producers feel they have to add profanity to a movie?  Vulgarity has become so commonplace in our society that most people are desensitized to it.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone who still has moral values.
B004K4AVAG|5.0|My daughter in law is a huge fan of Lady GaGa but had none of her cd's. Hopefully this is the beginning of her collection
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|A witty, raunchy, no-holds-barred tribute to 80's humor.  You will laugh out loud and feel guilty about it.  Any fan of the 80's will appreciate the plot devices and humor of this movie.  Seth is a genius.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|We had seenthe movie on tv and new it was a keeper. We have shared it with many of our church members.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|An excellent movie.  The story grabs you at the start and doesn't let go.  I am speechless.  Nolan has invested the time and heart to create a great cinematic experience.  Everything about this movie is top-tier.
0307591549|4.0|I purchased this book after seeing the author, Shawn Achor as a keynote speaker to a conference I attended. He is a very funny and captivating speaker. He was giving a brief summary of this book as the keynote address. The entire room was laughing. The book is very easy to read and has a lot of good take away points. I think we can all agree that having a positive outlook is beneficial so I am not sure the information is considered rocket science, but it is a good book and I would recommend the book and attending any speaking engagement Mr. Achor is giving.
142311339X|5.0|Very enjoyable series.  I look forward to reading the other books in the series as they become available - maybe the upcoming year?
B0017SWPXY|5.0|The story gives an amusing perspective of Denny's story from a dog's point of view.  Enzo captures the joy and the grief he and Denny share.  I would recommend this book to  dog lovers.
0131103628|5.0|I used it regularly to support some legacy software.  This has got to be one of the best books on C programming I have ever found.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|i thought this movie was great kept going at a pace to hold your interest and snuck in some real heartpounding scenes.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|So beautifully written you will experience thirst, hunger and aches as Pi does.  So spiritually infused that you will look at the world in a new and empowering way.
B00AB0AR2U|4.0|Not the best of the series but pretty good lots of action and new ideas and creatures entertaining for a cult film .
B007THA4FI|3.0|Stick with it- it may start slowly but Rowling creates thoughtful characters as the story Unfolds and builds momentum. Interesting glimpse into British small-town life and the common pettiness and hypocrisy that is the human condition.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|Pretty repetitive and and was the type of movie to put me asleep fast it moved along just fast enough to prevent that however.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Just an enjoyable read!  I loved the clever story, the colorful characters and was sad to have the story end. What an imaginative tale! Great book for anyone who has wanted to run away with the circus!
0316069884|5.0|Many have written about the horrors and repercussions of factory farms, but perhaps never so skillfully.  Foer manages to confront us with the almost unspeakable -- and to confront us with ourselves -- and then to disarm us in the next moment.  I count this among the most important books I've read, and I have deep gratitude for the clarity and direction it offered me.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Somewhere between beach reading and serious mystery writing, this book is an engaging read.  I tried hard not to like it as much as I did... but I really enjoyed the story and have to admit that the plot twists were great fun.
B007Q0OUNA|5.0|Great for Lord of the Rings fans and Lego Fans<br />Not too difficult to put together<br />Love the figures included in the kit.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! if you like temple run, you will LOVE this! Its just like temple run but wayyy better!! :)
B0091REZMW|4.0|I really enjoy playing this game. I especially like the fact its never ending. I look forward to many hours of enjoyable playing time.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This has something for everyone....not all great, but there's plenty of fun here!<br />I wish they all &quot;cost&quot; the same amount of coins, but that's how they get you to keep playing. I won't ever pay money for coins so it will take me a while to unlock some games.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|If you're looking for a comedy, this is not it.  This is about real life for the middle aged... in this case a married couple caught in the boring humdrum routine their lives have become.  I enjoyed this movie - but I had to take breaks during watching it to break up the glumness of the movie.  There were scenes that were very funny, and others that were sad.  I liked that the end didn't leave me hanging and there was a good outcome.  Steve Carell in a non-comedic role was a big surprise and he pulled it off perfect.  I don't think this movie is appropriate for young kids, or even teens.  It's a movie for mature adults and those who can handle the truth, and need a lesson about what life can become if you don't do something about it.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|One of the better SciFi stories I've read recently ... and a hoot to read, as well.  I'm certainly not a NASA science expert, but it all sounded darned accurate - or sufficiently accurate enough to be very entertaining, and definitely all I need in a fast book.  Sometimes tense, believeable and fast moving, and occasionally even funny to the point that it brought me to tears... No doubt one of the few times I've actually broken out in a loud guffaw while I read (my wife actually wanted to know what was so hilarious)..<br />While, yes, it does have a bit of 'gritty' language, no doubt in any similar REAL circumstance a lot worse would be heard, unintentionally or not, but a darned good story, nonetheless - and I've most assuredly paid many times the cost of this for much less entertaining reads.<br />I'd recommend it to anyone like myself who enjoys the 'escapism' of believable SciFi.
B0046ECJBY|5.0|the book is well written and very insightful. It explains contemporary behavior of the Chinese political system and how to judge in geopolitical perspective
1594487154|4.0|Let me first say that I received an advance copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />I gave to Sell Is Human four stars because I'm not allowed to post two separate reviews. If you are one of the eight out of nine people in America who does not formally sell for a living, then it is a five-star book and this first half is for you. If you make your living in sales, it's a three-star book and you can skip down to the second half.<br /><br />The majority of readers will definitely enjoy and profit from the book. Pink writes engagingly, and fills the book with fascinating research findings and compelling stories. It also provides a much-needed explanation and perspective on the profession and practice of selling. If you think you don't sell for a living, take a close look at how much of your day is spent trying to convince others of your point of view. And if you think selling is somehow beneath you, remember that what Plato said about politics is what Pink tells us about selling: those who refuse to participate in it end up being led by their \\"inferiors.\\"<br /><br />The theme of the book can be summarized as follows:<br /><br />* Selling is something we all do in our work and personal lives.<br />* Selling is talking someone into something that leaves them better off as a result.<br />* It has to be done right, because the balance of power has shifted from the seller to the buyer.<br />* When it's done right, it's a worthy and noble calling.<br /><br />If you're a \\"non-sales seller\\", you will certainly pick up a lot of useful insights and tips from the book.<br /><br />If you are a sales professional, especially one involved in complex corporate sales, you will probably also enjoy reading the book and will learn some new things, but don't confuse it with a complete book on the art of selling. You might also be put off a bit by some of the statements that are pronounced as great discoveries. For example, he tells us that the three qualities of attunement, buoyancy, and clarity \\"are the new requirements for effectively moving people on the remade landscape of the twenty-first century\\", as if we did not know that we're supposed to listen, keep an optimistic attitude, and frame our messages properly. And, did you know that when you're mapping the customer's decision process you're engaging  in \\"social cartography\\"? In addition, the book rightfully pans manipulative sales techniques, but then fills the book with many suggestions to do just that, such as mimicking the other person, touching them, even occasional swearing and rhyming. I'm afraid that some of the good will the book creates towards the sales profession may be erased when readers come across these embarrassing suggestions.<br /><br />On the plus side, Pink has come up with some interesting insights from social science research that even experienced salespeople can profit from. For example, we learn that salespeople who are neither too introverted or extraverted are the most successful, and I like his suggestion to use interrogative self-talk to conquer nerves before a sales call or presentation.ement, buoyancy, and clarity \\"are the new requirements for effectively moving people on the remade landscape of the twenty-first century\\", as if we did not know that we're supposed to listen, keep an optimistic attitude, and frame our messages properly.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|At first I wasn't sure  how I would like this book but had heard many whispers from friends on how good it was. So I decided to read it blindingly. I was pleasantly surprised by the love story behind it more than I was the naughty parts. I can't wait to find out what happens next.
1449410243|5.0|This book is HILARIOUS!  However, not appropriate for young children :)  We loved it so much, we're buying another copy as a gift for someone else.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|When I read The Name of the Wind (Day 1 in the Kingkiller Chronicles) I was flabbergahsted; it was one of the best books I had ever read.  Rothfuss is an amazing storyteller and I rushed to pick up the second book in the series.<br /><br />Needless to say, The Wise Man's Fear is just as wonderful.  I couldn't put it down.  Two days later I finished...and realized Day 3 was not even close to completion and my mind screamed, &#34;Noooooooooooooooo...&#34;<br /><br />Any book that makes me raise my fists in the air cursing the author's name deserves 5 stars.<br /><br />Do you hear that, Rothfuss?  We are waiting.  Waiting.  Waiting.  Stop being awesome for a moment and finish that book.

B003WUYRGI|4.0|The  book was nice to read I  enjoy reading this when  board I like  reading because when you read it it becomes  fun to read when I am board.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|This one is good but no where near the last one. The villain sucked compared to the joker. The Joker set the bar!<br />The last Barman was FANTASTIC!!! I would watch it again in a minute. But this one, one time was enough. Batgirl. Looser! But they picked the wrong actress for batgirl.<br />Robin was good! But Batgirl stunk!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Love the game. It keeps you moving and you don't want to put it down. I had to buy the full game and that made me upset.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game is a great time kill with an interesting story. Got it as a faotd. A little persistent in wanting a review.
B00AA0TJO8|1.0|on my Kindle Fire it keeps repeating the winter level, no matter how quickly I beat it. Too bad, it looks fun.

B007XKEY6Q|2.0|I bet I would like this game a lot if I could actually play it. I downloaded the game, set everything up, and then it asks me to &quot;put in password&quot;. I put in my password, making surenit was correct, then it kept telling me,&quot;invalid password&quot; so I could never play it.
B00846REIS|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone ! Definitely will keep you reading..impossible to put down. Ready for book two!
B0058VW36U|5.0|I absolutely love this game. I think that the only thing that could possibly make it any better would be if it had more levels. So addicting though!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Wonderful read. I felt that the second book was just as exciting as the first, they have a great ending, where I can wait for the third book to come out without horrible suspense. Love it!!
B0007KLH1Y|5.0|Sent this to my 10yr old grandson for Christmas and by Christmas afternoon I received an email with a photo of the fabulous castle he built...He LOVES his Kapla blocks!
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Fantastic read but I feel like I've read a similar book and there was a Julia Roberts movie that was very similar as well. The story has been done before, but it had a good surprise twist in the end.
B00003JRCQ|4.0|Was'nt crazy about Amanda Root but enjoyed everything else about the movie.  I love this type of story anyway.  Fantastic.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|This movie is Glee + Bridesmaids = awesome.  My husband enjoyed this as much as I did.  There was an easy to follow plot with a splash of romance (not overly mushy).  The singing was enjoyable, and  the laughs were plenty.  I would highly recommend this!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I like the fact is is not that easy,and is a challenge to complete. Its also free. I would definitely recomend this to my friends.
034580404X|2.0|I thought this was a little to graphic for my taste.  This why was have deviantes in this world who enjoy degrading women.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Good book.  I really enjoyed it.  The whole series is great and I recommend them to everyone.  Can't wait for the next movie.
145210655X|4.0|This purchase was a gag gift for my new son-in-law.  He is a huge Star Wars fan.  I thought this was too funny to pass up.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|Good game but the controls are a little too sensitive. Needs some time to get used to the play. No instruction manual.
0307341550|3.0|This was a Christmas present for my daughter.  I really hope she likes it.  This book had an interesting title for a mystery.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great story line and wish the game wasn't over so quickly. Overall it was a good, fun, interesting, addicting game
B000I0QL82|5.0|Holiday Inn is a prime example of Hollywood doing it right.  Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire are wonderful as rivals for the same girl.  Too bad they don't make movies like this anymore!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved it! Didn't see the end of the book coming though. Can't wait to read the next book. It's about to get popping up in here!
B000EYK4GW|3.0|I like Walt Disney movies and have started to collect them for when friends with kids come to visit.  Thanks
B003ODIZL6|5.0|OMG!This is the stupidest thing that I have to do. It's a good dictionary I guess. I used it to look up words, duh!!!!
B0050R0YB8|5.0|As always a large Lego set is much more fun to build that lasts longer. Star Destroyer is easier to build than older large sets because it has numbered block bags and does not need pre-sorting.
B0086700CM|5.0|Wow this game it is so fun how I found this game looked in the.app store thought the.game would be dum but I was playing like a snap of a finger when ok showed it to my dad he loved it plays it on his phone and like every hour this game is so fun
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Good quality game, keeps you on the edge of your seat.  I like the simplicity and quality.  Now if I could only kill the UFO's quicker I would do much better.  :)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Best book I have read in awhile! Read it in only a few days because  I couldn't put my kindle down! I highly recommend this book!
B0050XFY4O|5.0|Yes a refreshing change of pace for a gay film, so I really liked it enough to buy it later after I rented it.  Two good looking guys staring in the roles and so good writing to top it off I recommend it for sure.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love this book such detail it's amazing.I suggest everyone who reads should read this book. On to the next one....
B0054JZC6E|3.0|they told me to reveiw the game so i thats what im doing. oh i think it a pretty good game.
1450419895|5.0|This book is the best of the series. Filled with all the exercises and variations anyone needs to train for strength, size, endurance. Also has a wealth of information about training to match your individual anatomy and the scientific principles that will allow you to get the most out of strength training. If you're just starting out and/or you wish to train at home using minimal equipment, then opt for Strength Training Anatomy Workout I. Otherwise, this book combines all the wisdom of the authors in a single volume.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I love this series and flew through the first four books but I found myself wanting to skip parts of it that seemed to drag on.
1450400957|4.0|Delavier is one of the great trainers/educators in the world of fitness. This book is aimed at beginners and all of the exercises can be done at home with dumbbells, resistance bands, a pull-up bar, chair, and bed. The follow-up book, The Strength Training Anatomy Workout II is a bigger book that shows a greater range of exercises done primarily with barbells, dumbbells, and machines. Unless you are specifically looking for exercises done primarily with dumbbells, you will find everything and more in the second book, so it's not necessary to have this one as well. Ditto for the original Strenth-Training Anatomy. The Strength Training Anatomy Workout II combines all of Delavier's wisdom in a single volume.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|It was a great chick flick and I love music - so loving this movie was easy.  Love the gal that was in Bridesmaides----
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is the perfect app because you can sit down foe a while and play all the fun minigames or you can only play one game if you don't have time to play a bunch of games. This really is the perfect app to download!
B005LAIHY0|5.0|This movie was well priced and  my husband enjoyed watching it.  It was packaged in a padded box  and arrived quickly.
B0001VV1GK|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for 2.5 year old son and it entertains him for hours. He loves the elevator, speeding his cars down the ramps and every car gets a car wash at the end of the day. My daughters, 8 and 6, also play with the garage quite a bit.<br /><br />The quality is nice and I love not having a 1000 plastic pieces to keep up with like most toys.<br /><br />We play to expand on this with other plan city items as it is quite a favorite in the house.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I loved this book. Kate has a way of writing that is so beautiful.<br />Her first book was my favorite book. This is a close second tho!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This novel about two young adults with cancer makes you fall in love with the protagonists but not in a manipulative way. The plot is fun, down to earth, romantic, and thrilling despite the omnipresence of cancer. I had to race to the end to see how it would unfold, and it is sweet and just. I loved reading this book, one of the best of 2012.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|DVD set was very nice.  I love Alien and I am very pleased to have them all.  I didn't watch the bonus features.
0920668372|4.0|Great inspiration.  It is a story of son and mother, but I know my Great Grand Daughter will love it when she get's a little older.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Downloaded this app on my kindle fire hd and my droid razr....absolutely enjoy this app. Works great. Love the game
B001XUW26Q|4.0|LIKED THIS MOVIE A LOT.  IT KEPT US ENGAGED AND THE CHARACTERS WERE ORIGINAL, INTRIGUING, AND SYMPATHETIC.  DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED.  Hope they do a sequel.
B001KZG99A|5.0|I HAVE ENJOYED EVERY ORDER AND I AM SO GRATEFUL YOU HAVE BEEN SO CAREFUL WITH EVERY PURCHASE!<br />I thank everyone for being such guardian angels watching over me big time!
B00A757EFW|5.0|the game is very fun but when I got 11450 points it said the demo was over and it did not save my score I was dissapointed. still the game is fun and I highly recomend this game very easy controles and fun addicting gameplay.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Product I'm satisfied would recommend it to everyone I know this the best thing I every bought in my life
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I absolutely loved this book. It really made me think about life and stuff. Just wow....in a really good way.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|The quality of this product is quite high ,as is the quality of the show its self and its cast
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I'm a huge puzzle geek as is, however,I have a certain fondness for hidden object games and this one is right up my ally! I'm really enjoying the game play. The story-line is really intriguing. It has a macabre theme to it that I can' t resist being a fan of such ghoulish things. However,it isn't too overboard in the creepiness factor if your looking to purchase this for your child or even yourself. The hidden object mini games are never dull and each has it's own little twist as your story progresses. The extra side puzzle are a bonus o the game play and very in skill level. They certainly train you to keep your eyes open for extra goodies to help you throughout your game play. All in all, it's definitely worth the purchase and any spare time you have to just sit and challenge your noodle a bit.Now, back to game play.... I've not finished yet!
1416987118|5.0|My 3 year old granddaughter loves to act out the motions of the characters in the book.  It will be treasured for many years!
B007MNV5WU|2.0|So mad I paid $3.00 for poop. This game is lame and is an over priced piece of junk. Update sucks, just like Rovio. -DJ
B000P0J0A6|5.0|The tape was new and I received it in just a few days.  Happy!!!<br /><br />My boys watched as kids and they liked it so I thought my grandkids<br />would like it and they did.
B007N85POS|1.0|WOW! Rovio is now wanting $3.00 for all of their games just because they're HD? Give me a break. Waste of money. -DJ
B002SQNM9A|5.0|This is an amazing Christmas album.  My daughter and I agree that she sounds at her best and we played it multiple times on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, and have been listening to it still even after the holiday.  I would recommend this album to any Taylor Swift fan.
B009WO7NQO|2.0|What happened Rovio? From Angry Birds to this? Robio has gotten to greedy. They think they're the $#*% now, and just want money. WASTE! -DJ
B00318DA3W|5.0|A great Jane Austen novel with its keen insight into the minds and actions of its characters. Even better was the fact that, unlike some other classics, the &#34;translation&#34; is very good with very few omissions.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This is my favorite trilogy, and it came with a digital copy of all three movies! (Each one separately).  I have already watched all three consecutively, 5 times.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This was not my favorite Grisham book and I have read all of them.  I question the accuracy of the description of prisons.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|It is a really fun game it has very little adds and it is really fast running game too oh yeah
B0095J0AL6|5.0|I ordered four for my daughters and their friend and they just love the music.!!!!I got it right away too!!
B000MV9026|3.0|Dancing penguins are good for little kids.  My grandchildren seems to like the movie.  I don't know how a penguin with a Scottish accent advances the story, but I suppose it's meant to distinguish that penguin from the others (a problem with penguins).  This is a kids' movie that I have to sit through rather than enjoy with the kids, but they are ok with it.
B005V4FJC4|4.0|Great sound and some interesting takes on some classics. I like the simple guitar and vocals that give this album a classic sound.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|This film is A Plus in my opinion.  Kids (even little ones) and adults can enjoy it.  Definitely will be replayed many years.
1451648537|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this biography of Steve Jobs.  I find him to be a fascinating man who lead an interesting full life.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun different kind of games. Some are easy but there's definantly a mixture of games for everyone and hours of fun!
B0058VW36U|5.0|If you enjoy games like Angry Birds, Plants vs. Zombies, or Fruit Ninja, then this game is for you! Cut the Rope offers pleasant and cartoon graphics that help objects look crisp and clear. The game is addicting and enjoyable for all ages! I hope you enjoy this game as much as I did, it is well worth the dollar. Must I remind you there is a sequel, Cut the Rope: Experiments?
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great game, I am surprise that I like it because the action is a little slow. But it is up there with other games I like.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|Anybody will enjoy this magnificent game, it is a very original and creative game. My two complaints are that this game is just like the free version and all of the ads that are disguised as &quot;rewards.&quot;<br />The graphics are neat and require no further adjustments, the gameplay is solid and entertaining, and lastly, I'M SICK OF ALL OF THESE IMPOSTERS!!!
B000FA5STS|5.0|Was great, would recommend anyone to read this.<br />This was my second book I have read by him, the first one was The Winner.<br />Will be reading more of his books.
B008AITJ24|5.0|Love the season seven of Bones! The characters are all so good, and they never seem to run out of new plots. Always interesting!
1594487154|5.0|Having read previous Dan's book [[ASIN:1594484805 Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us]] and [[ASIN:1594481717 A Whole New Mind: Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the Future]], I was interested how he portrays the art of selling. He is no doubt a master story teller. In this book, he goes on to tell how the concept of sales is morphed from one form to another with the advent of plethora of information people have in their hands. Even when I went to buy a car in 1999, I went with a binder full of information printed from car buying websites so that I could effectively bargain with the dealer. These days buyers have all the more power. Dan outlines various sectors including educational and medical which are highly sales oriented in a different sense.<br /><br />In the old times, Dan says \\"A-B-C,\\"  stood for  \\"A - always.  B - be. C - closing.\\" Always be closing. He says, \\"Always be closing\\" is a cornerstone of the sales cathedral. Its simplicity makes it understandable; its alphabetically makes it memorable.  But these days this advice is outdated. When buyers have many options, lots of information and  To Sell is Human introduces the new ABC's:<br /><br />A for Attunement B for  Buoyancy and C for Clarity. These three qualities are now essential whether you're trying to move a prospect to buy a computer system or your daughter to do her homework.<br /><br />Attunement is the capacity to take another's perspective, to understand their interests, and to see the world from their point of view. Buoyancy is the capacity to stay afloat on what one salesman calls an \\"ocean of rejection.\\" Clarity is the capacity to make sense of murky situations, to curate information rather than merely access it, and to move from solving existing problems to finding hidden ones. To Sell is Human reviews the science of why these qualities are so effective. But it also includes an array of tools, tips, and exercise to help you hone your abilities. There is a separate chapter for each of these concepts.<br /><br />There are chapters dealing with what to do aspect dealing with Pitch, Improvise and Serve. There are several interesting concepts explained in nice way in the chapter Pitch . Dan calls them, The 6 Successors of the Elevator Pitch. Eleveator pitch refers to if the big boss ever strode into your elevator, you'd be able to smoothly explain what you did at the company by the time you reached your floor.<br /><br />  In this book, Dan argues we should adopt a different approach.<br />The Question Pitch (What: A pitch that asks a question instead of making a statement.), The Rhyming Pitch, The Subject Line Pitch (Every email subject line is a pitch), The One-Word Pitch, The Twitter Pitch and The Pixar Pitch<br /><br />Dan uses lot of social science research. One could argue these research always have another side, but he uses a wide variety of research from a lot of sources and mixes with common sense ideas which makes the book a powerful one for anyone engaged in the art of selling whether in a conventional sense or otherwise.h of these concepts.<br /><br />There are chapters dealing with what to do aspect dealing with Pitch, Improvise and Serve.

B007K3JFUQ|5.0|Loved the movie! Loved the first one, and the second did not disappoint! Glad I bought it! Robert Downey Jr. is perfect for this part.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|This is a superb movie. It has a riveting story line with a good message for girls--&#34;Be True to Yourself&#34;
B0076HN3T0|5.0|If you are a music junkie, specifically, the Foo Fighters, this is the documentary or you. Wonderful, they are very open in this doc.
0547884591|5.0|I love this book. Forget the haters. Tim Ferriss is a modern day rockstar. The info in the book is presented in such a way that you can just jump around and take what you need and what works for you or follow along on the cooking \\"course\\" and have a blast.<br /><br />It's been beneficial in this way:<br /><br />1. I took the Kale chips recipe, made them and got my kids and wife excited (!!) about eating.....kale. Worth the price alone.<br /><br />2. I now make the BEST (their words) scrambled eggs in the world.<br /><br />A non-cook changes his stripes. There are other benefits and some great learning to be had in this book. Buy it and go on the adventure. A 600+ page book for 21 measly bucks? No brainer.<br /><br />Enjoy
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|It was not a good movie, the language was horrible,there was not 10 min that went without a 5 sec cuss fest, if it was free would not watch it again...
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Love love love hidden object games especially ones with great story line and graphics definitely got sucked into playing this game. Very addicting and worth the money
1612130283|2.0|I read through the first 200 or so pages in an instant. Because of that I'll give it two stars vs. the one. As it did hold my interest in the beginning. Not sure what I was thinking. I'm going to chalk it up to at times Anastasia did have a smart mouth, but then she would go back to being a timid girl. Which one are you? It can't be both!! I hate her inner-goddess. WTH has one of these?! A mid-summer eves fairy that flits around doing dances because you finally got laid? Creepy. If I had to read one more time about Mr. Grey's blank grey eyes that would command an O upon her looking into them under her lashes I was going to vomit. Is she a damn muppet? She must have the longest lashes ever, I'm envisioning snuffleupagus here...let me add to this but saying how incredibly redundant this tale is. I kept wishing Ana would leave Mr. Grey and have some time to herself, but there he was suffocating her again and fishing another FOIL PACKET (I dislike the word \\"foil\\" now) from his pants that hung just so on his hips. Can I please say for the record I've never stared at a man's hips!! It was the same thing page after page. I kept hoping the next page would bring something anew, nope, same garbage as before. How can a character who likes all those literary greats be so simple, while those characters were complex. Especially Elizabeth Bennett. Please she would b*tch slap Anastasia while simultaneously ridding Mr. Grey of his \\"impressive\\" length. UGH!!<br /><br />Unless your into cheesy story-lines that have no depth...this isn't for you. A book is supposed to enrich your mind, entertain, etc. This book did none of those things for me after pg. 200.
B001DWXUWY|5.0|love this album...beyond fabulous! this album really blew a lot of people away and really gave a jumpstart to an awesome band.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I am glad John Grisham has gone back to writing about lawyers.  This book kept me very interested and I was surprised at the ending.
B001M790RE|5.0|love this album soooo much! it will never get old, even if i do! :) i could definitely definitely listen to it on repeat!
B006LSZECO|4.0|The build up was intriguing but the finale was bordering on disappointing but does its job in that I would like to read more.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|dark but fun..enjoyed the mini games and many hidden pictures. Husband~17 year old daughter and I all played seperately on our Kindles and everyone enjoyed it (until my husband upgraded to the 8.9 HD Fire and couldn't play.
B00AQ71FLK|3.0|Heroes of Order and Chaos is a great game. It is a lot like League of Legends, but it takes a lot of space. I had to delete all but one app to have enough space for the secondary download. I assume that since it is new, the next few updates will decrease the size. Until then, though, it takes about 70% of the app space in the secondary download. Pretty crazy.<br />But the game is great!! Love it!
B009H442DG|5.0|I am an avid Olivia fan so I rate this album one of the best Christmas duet albums in a long time. It is great to see that they are still the one you want to hear and see together after all these years. The new song I Think You Might Like It is the best and again Olivia teaming up with the ultimate John Farrar who produced most of Olivia's hits in the 70's and 80's I also want to say how beautiful they both are so healthy looking.
B004LWZW9C|4.0|In my much younger days in high school and college, I used to think it would be cool to go to Times Square one New Year's Eve to watch the ball drop.  Now that I'm middle-aged...not so much.  Standing in the cold (and maybe rain or snow) for the better part of a day doesn't seem nearly as appealing now--watching the proceedings on television is just fine.<br /><br />The ball drop in New York City is known the world over, and the 2011 film \\"New Year's Eve\\" follows several individuals and couples in and near the Big Apple as they approach a new year.  As you would expect in a movie like this, there is a great deal of symbolism--hope and second chances, birth and death, the old looking back and trying to come to terms with regrets from the past, and the young intently focused on the future.<br /><br />The cast is first-rate, with Robert De Niro, Sarah Jessica Parker, Michelle Pfeiffer, and many more big names--Ryan Seacrest and Michael Bloomberg even make cameo appearances.  Even though this is a chick flick that definitely would not normally appeal to someone in my demographic, the stories are passable enough if New Year's Eve has always been one of your favorite holidays and you have always loved the ball drop--and the cinematography of Times Square as midnight approaches is also very well-done.

1439152802|4.0|For this review, as well as many, many more please feel free to visit my blog, The Baking Bookworm on Blogspot.<br /><br />Author: Kate Morton<br />Type: E-book (NetGalley)<br />Genre: Historical Fiction<br />First Published: October 2012<br />Publisher: Atria books<br />First Line: \\"Rural England, a farmhouse in the middle of nowhere, a summer's day at the start of the nineteen sixties.\\"<br /><br />Synopsis:  During a summer party at the family farm in the English countryside, sixteen-year-old Laurel Nicolson has escaped to her childhood tree house and is happily dreaming of the future. She spies a stranger coming up the long road to the farm and watches as her mother speaks to him. Before the afternoon is over, Laurel will witness a shocking crime. A crime that challenges everything she knows about her family and especially her mother, Dorothy--her vivacious, loving, nearly perfect mother.<br /><br />Now, fifty years later, Laurel is a successful and well-regarded actress living in London.  The family is gathering at Greenacres farm for Dorothy's ninetieth birthday. Realizing that this may be her last chance, Laurel searches for answers to the questions that still haunt her from that long-ago day, answers that can only be found in Dorothy's past.<br /><br />Dorothy's story takes the reader from pre-WWII England through the Blitz, to the '60s and beyond. It is the secret history of three strangers from vastly different worlds--Dorothy, Vivien, and Jimmy--who meet by chance in wartime London and whose lives are forever entwined. The Secret Keeper explores longings and dreams and the unexpected consequences they sometimes bring. It is an unforgettable story of lovers and friends, deception and passion that is told--in Morton's signature style--against a backdrop of events that changed the world.<br /><br />My Thoughts:  When I saw that a book by Kate Morton was being made available on NetGalley to review I jumped at the chance to request it.  When I got the go-ahead from the publisher I'm not ashamed to admit that I did a little happy dance.  Why?  Because I adore rich historical fiction sagas that are well-written and so descriptive that you can easily picture the scenes in your head.  Kate Morton is one of those author's who can take you back in time and write a story that keeps you interested yet throws you enough twists that make you change your initial assumptions about her wonderfully complex characters.  How's that for a recommendation!?<br /><br />So did \\"The Secret Keeper\\" meet my expectations?  Oh, yes!  This is a wonderfully written combination of a family saga set in a rich, tumultuous historical setting and a murder mystery.  The book jumps back and forth from present day to the Blitz with many points of view.  And while this could make for a very muddled read, Ms Morton writes so seamlessly between the two eras while balancing the various viewpoints that this story and its characters quickly drew me in.<br /><br />I think what really helped to keep me interested was how my view of the main characters changed throughout the book.  As I learned more and more about the different main characters and what truly happened, I found myself changing my initial feelings towards them.  The innocent may not be so innocent.  One person's take on a situation may be influenced by various factors and therefore I now see them in a much different light.  I found myself rooting for various characters throughout the book and that helped me, not only learn more about the inner thoughts and motivations of the characters, but made them much more believable and authentic.  There are no clich&eacute;d, one-dimensional characters here.  Everyone is layered with the good, the bad and the not so lovely.<br /><br />There are several main characters, each with a very distinctive voice. We have Laurel, the sixty year old woman who returns home to care for her ailing mother, Dorothy and is determined to figure out what she saw fifty years before.Then there's Dorothy/Dolly who is portrayed as the ailing mother of Laurel in 2011 as well as during the WWII era where she is a young woman who is just trying to make ends meet during the tumultuous Blitz with her boyfriend, Jimmy.  By contrast, Vivien is the very vivacious and rich younger wife of her famous author husband, Henry. As the story unfolds, we see these characters' fates entangle with each other. What we initially thought about one character we may come to see in a very different light.<br /><br />Another thing that I adore about historical fiction is that I get to learn about eras in history that I knew little or nothing about.  While I'd heard about the Blitz I cannot say that I knew much about it.  Ms Morton describes vividly what London was like during the Blitz.  The fear of the bombs, the loss, the hunger, followed after awhile by the normalcy of living with the bombings.  She brings a believable voice to a very horrible time.<br /><br />Overall, I found that the wonderful characters and the turbulent era in which they lived paired with an ending that will surprise you makes this a very enjoyable read.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />My Rating: 4/5 stars<br /><br />Note: My sincere thanks to Atria Books, Kate Morton and NetGalley for providing me with this complimentary copy of The Secret Keeper in exchange for my honest review.there's Dorothy/Dolly who is portrayed as the ailing mother of Laurel in 2011 as well as during the WWII era where she is a young woman who is just trying to make ends meet during the tumultuous Blitz with her boyfriend, Jimmy.

Highly recommended.<br /><br />My Rating: 4/5 stars<br /><br />Note: My sincere thanks to Atria Books, Kate Morton and NetGalley for providing me with this complimentary copy of The Secret Keeper in exchange for my honest review.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|First off, the streaming experience in HD was flawless over our Roku box with high speed cable internet. We have Prime and that has had a few bumps in the past, but recently has improved and this rented movie experience was great.<br /><br />The movie itself was very good. It had the action you would expect, but also had alot of story to go along with it. I won't put any spoilers in my review. My 14 year old and I both agreed that we are anxiously awaiting the next installment of this series of movies.
B0053O89WY|5.0|cheaper then any store is asking not a fake it is the real deal i saw some were saying other sites sold ones that looked like they were coppys these are not that great deal for sure!!!!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Great movie. My grandson and I loved watching it together. I would recommend it to other families. My grandson is 6
B005KR6OBM|5.0|My husband and i love this show so when i thought of a gift for christmas this was a no brainer it was a great price they are authentic movies same as if you bought them seprate in store only differance is they are cheaper to buy them this way we are very happy with them
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Can not wait to start the second book.....I read the 1st book in a day and a half! Loved it!!!!!
B000VYX8PE|4.0|It was awesome but very at the same time it's like you didn't know what was going to happen next
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|There are some books that are read just to be read; books that never inspire love or grace, simply hold attention and then are forgotten once their covers close. TFIOS is not one of those books. I read the entire thing in about five hours, and by the end, I was absolutly humbled by every gift of life I have. dftba.
B00000IQW5|5.0|Richard Dreyfuss makes you really believe in love and a possibility of what the afterlife may or could bring.  It is such a great story, an excellent cast and a wonderful overall movie!
0061692042|4.0|This isn't light reading and this isn't a thriller. If you can get over those two things, this is a remarkable novel. It's not quite a five-star book, but its very, very close.
075669812X|5.0|My almost seven year old son LOVES these books!  He especially wanted this one because of the figure it came with.
B001L83PLQ|4.0|This novel jumps back and forth between events in Nigeria in the early 1960s and culminates at the end of the Nigerian-Biafran war in 1970. The brutalities of war are highlighed with heartbreaking detail. I'm glad I read this novel, but would caution that it is not for the faint of heart (or stomach). Nevertheless, if you can manage to stay with the story, I promise this is one of those stories that will stay with you.
030758836X|5.0|I read this book in a day. I couldn't put it down! It constantly keeps you on your toes! I really hope they make a movie out of it.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|It is surprising (and refreshing) that a novel set in Germany during WWII can still be inventive and captivating. The writing felt a little clunky to me, so I can't give it five stars, but it was an excellent story.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Loved everything about the movie. Carrell was fantastic in the lead. This will be my new go-to movie when I need a lift!!
0385344228|2.0|I don't usually read mysteries or thrillers, but I started this one and came across this great quote in the first few pages:<br /><br />I do not believe in the court system, at least I do not think it is especially good at finding the truth. No lawyer does. We have all seen too many mistakes, too may bad results. The jury verdict is just a guess--a well-intentioned guess, generally, but you simply cannot tell fact from fiction by taking a vote. And yet, despite all that, I do believe in the power of the ritual. I believe in the religious symbolism, the black robes, the marble-columned courthouses like Greek temples. When we hold a trial, we are saying a mass. We are praying together to do what is right and to be protected from danger, and that is worth doing whether or not our prayers are actually answered.<br /><br />Wow, right!? I assumed the rest of the book would be full of similar kinds of insightful metaphors, but I was mistaken. It is a compelling read, one you hate to put down, but in the end, that just wasn't enough for me. The characters are all one-dimensional and flat. By page 200, the story had become a Lifetime Movie with caricatures instead of complicated and complex characters. It was a good story and an interesting premise, but the story telling itself left much to be desired.
B008LZYR0A|5.0|Its the Pet Shop Boys. No need to say anymore.  They keep producing great product.  I like the remixes best and they always have different packaging than most artist.  Highly Collectable.
B0084U0IEG|1.0|I've been had. I saw Ian McEwan's name and I really believed this would be a well-written and engaging novel. That's certainly what the reviewers were saying. So I paid full price for this book. And then read the whole thing. I was a fool.<br /><br />Serena's character is about as uninspiring as they come. While ostensibly intelligent--she has a degree in math from Cambridge--she is mostly just the advocate of the views of whichever man she is sleeping with. After she graduates, she gets a job in MI5 where her first assignment is to clean a house. She is not pretending to be a cleaning lady; she is actually expected to clean. Is Serena offended? Not really. She comments, \\"I think I must have absorbed the general spirit of camaraderie and cheerful devotion to duty among the women. I was becoming like my mother . . . Like her I had my own strong-minded inclination to obey.\\" Gag me. There was nothing strong-minded (or strong) about Serena.<br /><br />Character development is also lacking. All of the characters seem like mouthpieces for the author to discuss politics and the cold war. As a result, none of the characters come to life as authentic or dynamic human beings.<br /><br />The writing wasn't anything noteworthy. Example: \\"When he took my nipple into his mouth I thought we were going to be all right. I'd almost forgotten the sensation, hot and electric and piercing, spreading up round the base of my throat and right down to my perineum.\\" Really? McEwan has been twice-nominated for the Man Booker prize he needed to rely on the word \\"perineum\\" to describe a love scene? How can that be?<br /><br />For me, the only redeeming storytelling here the short stories of the character T.H. Haley. Even when told in summary, they are more entertaining and engaging than any \\"real\\" storyline in the novel.<br /><br />In the end, this is a spy novel with no mystery, and a love story with no romance. I would only recommend it to the literary masochist who is willing to suspend his/her own reading pleasure so that Ian McEwan can have some fun playing a cheap trick.
B0052SF6CM|5.0|There are few albums now that you can put on your CD player (is that old fashion now?) and play the entire CD...This is one!
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|this game is ok not the greatest in the world -- the levels are too hard for my 10  yr, old
B008B0QH5S|5.0|Pet Shop Boys do it again.  I do hope they tour the US later this year.  Too bad US Radio fails to play them....!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is my second time reading the book and I must say it is just as good. One of my favorite story lines of all time. Two thumbs up for Collins.
B005LAJ17M|4.0|Well done series.  I discover a new and interesting fact each time I view it.  I'll share it with friends.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is very good and I recommend it to anybody who likes action and adventure books. You should also read the rest of this series.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|If you liked the normal Angry Birds you’ll like this version.<br />It’s the same addictive pig smashing fun of the original Angry Birds with an outer space Sci-Fi twist.  The graphics are nice and sharp on my HD Kindle.  The only down side is if I use my styles instead of my finger I can the birds to misfire more often.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|:)<br />and<br />:D<br />This book had so much detail and suspense I literally could not put it down. I LOVED IT!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This was one of the first apps I got for my new kindle fire HD 8.9.<br /> I love how it makes good use of the full screen size, giving you nice big buttons and an easy to read display.  Seeing as it free you really cant beat the price.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Absolutely looved over this book!! Recommend it for high schoolers who can relate. It's a very cute and touching book, and surprising at some points.
0312430000|4.0|This is a fantastic book for anyone involved in complex project management; hope to use this approach at work and love the organizational approach.
B0091REZMW|3.0|It's a good game so far but a bit fast paced to start. I like it but if u don't pick up on things quickly, don't play this game
B004N6369Y|2.0|Kept me Interested to read as I kept thinking there would be something other than brain dead words Also too much discrepancy in happenings  You don't go out with a \\"defibrillator\\" if you're monitored for a heart attack If you \\"walk into hotel\\" after being released from hospital you can't use the same \\"wheelchair to take Natalie\\" to waiting vehicle to take to hospital TOO MANY AUTHORS HAVE TOO MUCH MONEY TOO MANY GHOST WRITERS & PREY ON READERS
B009CGR0LA|5.0|This film has become one of my favorites. Great story, script and musical score! I think it was very well done, indeed!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|One of my favorite super-hero movies of all time.  Each character is unique and the interplay between them was captured perfectly by Joss Whedon.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Love, love, love this movie!  My favorite escape from the Christmas craziness.  I quote it all year long.  Most entertaining!
B006LSZECO|1.0|Horrible. Ongoing repetitive. I literally shook my head upon completion. I forced myself to finish it thinking it had to get better. Terribly mistaken.
1439152802|4.0|This book started out slow for me but once it go to the meat of the story, I was hooked! This was the first Kate Morton book I read but it won't be the last.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|funny and definitly not for young kids. although i dont think it is one of those movies you could watch over again
B006P4FBUE|5.0|Great for little kids to learn their musical notes and lots of fun ways to use it.  I like having two keyboards in two different keys, gets you closer to having a mini full size.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I really liked this book, thought it was well written, and felt for the parents. I thought some of the plot lines were a little simplistic and the ending a bit of a cop out. But, particularly in view of the continued deranged-young-men shootings around the country, I think Landay had some interesting insights in what it must be like to be the parents of such a child.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Gives me all that I need to know about current weather conditions.  Not much more to say, I can check the weather before I even get out of bed!
B009D5VNLS|5.0|We will purchase when it is available.  We really enjoyed it and will watch it again and again.  Very fun.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I have a few issues with this, not being able to play my zynga games is a bit annoying, and typing on the face of the kindle is not exactly my idea of fun.  I'll stick to doing my games and updates on my desk top.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|We really enjoyed the Lorax.  It was a little intense for part of the story but it was fun and we would watch it again.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Entertaining, good twists, Fun flick...the only thing that bothered me was the motor cycle chase. Seems receptive from previous Bournes.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|The music is good. The story was a good one.  The vomit not believeable but otherwise it was a fun movie.
044022425X|5.0|This is #4 in the Outlander series, and it was every bit as good as the first!  I am on to #5!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Bought book as a gift for my wife, but I read it over the holidays.  I have ready several of the Grisham books, but the pace of this book is really slow.  I couldn't establish any kind of love/hate relationship with the characters.  In the end, I didn't really care if they get by with it or not.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I LUV thzis game. Its so entertaining and I luv how they put in all the new things to do with the hair!
034580404X|5.0|I ordered these books for my wife. She is crazy over them, so much so that she has been begging me to read them, even though she knows that I don't read much. Anyways, they seemed to make her very happy and in turn made me very happy, which is why I gave this item 5 stars.
B004GYY714|4.0|l like this app because it bring up all my local stations and more. at lunch time able to listen to my favorite program.
B0063GORYU|5.0|An addictively fun card game that runs the gamut between beginner and expert.  Children should be able to play as easily as adults.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|There is a lot more to this book than S&M.  It is a deep, lyrical journey into the human psyche. While the erotica is intense and descriptive, there is so much more to Christian Grey . This novel is moving and definitely more than \\"mommy porn\\". I would recommend this read to any adult who has ever fallen in love with someone that didn't love you back.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Captured me in the first few pages. Gripping story about finding strengths in yourself when you have been beaten down. Loved the characters.
B009JBZH54|5.0|If you are a Batman fan, you should definitely buy this item. It comes with a small magazine with pictures behind the scenes. This is a &#34;must have&#34; item. I'm such a fan that I even bought this as a pre-order item.
B008476HBM|5.0|Reading this book for the second time although enjoying if immensely more the second being of my own choice. Really a splendid author describing quite effectively lively characters.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Absolutely, positivley the MOST amazing game I have ever played on Kindle Fire! The graphics must be seen to be believed,so awesome that one time playing and you will be permanently hooked. This is Mahjong to the nth degree! Deserves much more than just 5 stars. If you enjoy matching games,this is a MUST BUY!!!
B007MDB6L0|5.0|My 6 year old granddaughter requested this as one of her Christmas presents.  I haven't watched the movie, but if it makes her happy (and it seemed too), it's a great product from my viewpoint!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Want more coins. Must have more coins!! Need more coins! Why do more coins cost money?? Want FREE coins. FREE!!!
B005K17RU0|4.0|This is an informative application which will certainly help weather watchers. The one fault I can find is the inability to delete a location once entered. Fix this bug and you have a 5 star app.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Lyric and I love it!  She is only 1year old, and I think she play this game more than me.  I like the fact that there's no interruptions.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is pretty fun. good to have if you need to kill some time. or are just bored. I'm glade I got it.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|This one was a bit confusing and definitely not as good as the previous Dark Knight movies. Cat Woman was a plus.
B009LY72LQ|4.0|Easy to put together. My first CAM so it was awesome making my own doll. The only thing I don't like is how the ears for the werewolf dont stay in the hair like the picture on the packaging shows.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Best of the 3 books, a fitting end to the trilogy. More emotion than the first 2 books, great back story on Christian.
B00005RDRO|5.0|I am on older gentleman and have either read or saw movies from all of these characters that this movie is spoofing. I find it highly entertaining and funny. Some younger folks might not know who Charlie Chan,the thin man or poirot is but still think the movie is entertaining. If you do know who people like Miss Marple or Sam Spade is you will really get a kick out of this movie.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I downloaded the game for free on my Kindle Fire not expecting it to be very good.  I was pleasantly surprised when I started to follow a storyline that was interesting with fantastic graphics!!  The characters look real & the sound is clear when the characters speak.  The carnival setting is fun & interesting & you feel like your jn the story. The story moves around so you'r not doing the same thing over & over. Definitely a worth while game!!!!
B0042U94UQ|1.0|I NEVER RECIEVED MY PURCHASE AND THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ONE OF MY DAUGHTERS' CHRISTMAS PRESENTS... I AM HIGHLY DISAPOINTED AND I CAN NOT EVEN FILE A CLAIM!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't know what to say other than..AMAZING!! Very well written. Keeps you on your toes. Makes you laugh, cry, laugh so hard you cry, and everything in between. I never write reviews. But I just finished one of my new favorite books of all time. Colleen Hoover has broken my heart and put it back together. If you read this book read her others. If you read her others read this book. I can only hope she doesn't stop writing anytime soon. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED BOOK!!! :)
B003JTHXOK|3.0|NICHOLAS Sparks is always a good read and this was no disappointment. A real page turner! I thoroughly enjoyed it!
B008NR8YTQ|5.0|I've been a fan of Gary's since the Thin Lizzy days.<br />Once he focused on the blues, his music really rang out.<br />This guy burned like few others can.<br />He had the gift.  This disc serves that well!<br />We will miss you.
1582701709|4.0|This is an interesting book that appeals to everyone who is looking for the balance in life.  I have told many people about it.
B002HK9IDQ|4.0|Bought this for my mother for christmas she loves this movie we have it on vhs but its starting to wear out so I got it on dvd :)
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book be was wonderful! I typically don't like books with a lot of violence but this book was magnificent. Even though I saw the movie before I read the book I still found myself enthralled by Collins writing. I cannot wait to read the remaining two books in the trilogy.
B0034G4P4O|4.0|I thought this was a good movie to watch, a bit odd but hey you can't have everything and the computer graphics were great and its a swashbuckling adventure :D
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for our two oldest granddaughters.  When they opened it, they immediately played it and loved it.  They'd seen it at the movies first and really wanted the video.  Amazon had it at a great price and it was delivered quickly with 1-click.
B0058YPL66|4.0|I'm a fan so of course i had to buy this why else wouldn't I?! but besides that I think its a really cool show very imaginative :)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I could not put this book down. It was very good and interesting the whole way through. I highly  recommend  this book to anyone who loves a good story. Be warned though, you will be on edge throughout the entire book. Another awesome book by Nicholas.
B00AMS4YVQ|5.0|This may be his best album ever.  I can only think of two words to describe this album, &#34;Instant Classic&#34;.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|As in the previous Dark Knight movies, this one is also excellent.  Great ending.  Can't wait to see what they do next.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|Funny enough that it was worth watching.  The unrated version is definitely not for children, not sure about the rated version.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|I have all of the MIB movies.  This one has a great story line.  I especially love the ending in this one...explains a lot.
B007IL5D3S|3.0|Although the story line started out reasonably good, it became too complicated and overstretched the imagination. The ending was very weak and didn't reflect the substance of the story
B002BI6SMI|3.0|I enjoyed the movie's action, but more than anything the movie should be appreciated for its candid portrayal of sex trafficking in Europe. I like that the movie tackled this subject, but viewers should be aware of the fact that some scenes in the movie are emotionally disturbing because they show kidnapped women involuntarily strung out on drugs and being used for sex. It's a movie worth watching more because of the subject it tackles than because of the action, so viewers should be prepared for it to be heavier than a Bourne movie.
B0072QPV6I|5.0|Whether you are a Chemical Brothers fan or not, this movie has incredible visuals with powerful tracks to make you dance. Have seen this multiple times already and just can't get enough. Makes me wish I could see this live.
B005LAII12|5.0|We saw it in the theater - had to have it at home (on my son's Christmas list).  Mark Walberg, Seth Rogan...what more needs to be said.  Viewer warning - NOT FOR THE PRUDISH!
B005MW6IRU|5.0|never thought i would own a mastodon cd but after hearing this on amazon i was quite impressed with the style they have taken here. if this is whats to come with future mastodon cds then i i'm looking forward to the next.until then i will keep this hunter cd in heavy rotation
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I like the game......it has been fun and interesting. I haven't been asked to spend any money, and that's what I like so far.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I choose this product cause I like playing bingo.  I think it's fun and am not dissapointed.  Wish I had more time to play.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|ANGRY BIRDS IS JUST PLAIN FUN FOR ADULTS AND KIDS. HAVE APPS ON A COUPLE DIFFERENT DEVICES. LOVE ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF ANGRY BIRDS
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Coin Dozer<br /><br /> - I like it and it's fun.  Would recommend it to anyone young or old.  It reminds you of when you were a kid
B000AJIF4E|5.0|These are excellent headphones for the price. I've done a fair bit of research and in addition to some recommendations to some co-workers who handle the media side of things at work, these headphones seem to have some of the flattest frequency response in their price range and probably up to the $250 mark. What this means is that your audio isn't \\"colored\\" in any way. While some people may find that the bass is softer than they're used to, there's a good probability that they've been listening to bass-heavy headphones. I figure if you want to adjust the frequency response, you can always use an EQ.<br /><br />I also own a pair of Grado SR60i's, and while the Grados have a certain spaciousness or openness to them, due to being open-back headphones, they leak a lot of noise, and I have to say that I think the sound reproduction is better on the 7506's. I also suspect that the 7506s will break in after 30-50 hours from what I've read, and that the low end will tighten up a little. The Sony MDR-7506 are also widely considered to be the \\"standard\\" headphones for use in professional audio and video editing and recording, and it's for a reason. They can easily be driven by portable sources, offer excellent isolation from outside noises and leak very little noise at normal listening levels; there's also the aforementioned flatness of their frequency response. They're also relatively comfy, though I'll probably replace the earpads with some plush velour Beyerdynamic ones at some point. Also note that I have a head and ears on that are on the smaller side.<br /><br />Some other headphones I researched and looked at were the Audio-Technica ATH-M50s, which have a slightly heavier bass response and were more expensive, though I almost settled on them due to the fact that they look a little cleaner and modern appearance-wise. However, I listen to a lot of classical music, and flatness of the frequency response was my #1 criteria. I also considered upgrading to the Grado SR125i's from the SR60i's, but those earpads are just killer (even the upgraded ones that don't sit flat on your ears hurt badly after an hour or so), and as mentioned above, they leak a ton of noise and are unsuitable for portable music playing and travel. I also considered the Sennheiser HD518s, but honestly didn't do a ton of research into them. When the \\"Beats\\" first came out several years ago, I owned a pair for a week or so out of curiosity, and promptly returned them, as my Grado SR60i's, which cost 1/4 of the price sounded far better. The Beats were extremely bass-heavy, and it muddied up all of the other sound. The MDR-7506s, ATH-M50s, HD518s and any entry-level Grado phones are WAY better than the Beats and cost less than half the price. Thumping bass does not equal sound quality (unless that's what you're looking for, I suppose...). I did also consider the Beyerdynamic DT880s, but at $250, they are well out of the comparison range for these phones, though I almost caved and got them instead.<br /><br />Technical junk: I haven't had the 7506's too long, but I use them primarily for music listening on my home computer. I play 16/44 or higher .flac files run through foobar2000 using event-style WASAPI to send the audio to an AudioEngine D1 DAC. For portable listening, I usually play .flacs on my iPhone with the FLAC Player app.from the SR60i's, but those earpads are just killer (even the upgraded ones that don't sit flat on your ears hurt badly after an hour or so), and as mentioned above, they leak a ton of noise and are unsuitable for portable music playing and travel.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|5 star because I couldn't put it down. Very good story with plenty of detail. I would recommend to anyone. Great book, can't wait to start second!
B002YCVX5S|1.0|We wanted to,watch this movie in HD. However, every five minutes the movie would stop and a &#34; Quality HD&#34; screen would appear. After this happened six or seven times, we went back to try the non-HD version. The movie did not download at all, we received an error message. When we tried,to,go back to,the Library, the movie was not listed. We ended up being charged for both the regular and the HD versions, neither of which were downloaded. This never happened when we had Netflix, I guess we will go back to using that service and not use Amazon.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Love that I don't have to deal with the pop up ads after each hand like the free version.  I thought it would have more options for play is the only reason it didn't get 5 stars.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|It never downloaded but email shows it did. I thought my granddaughter might like this cause she is three but it didn't work.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|There was a problem with sending it to our address.  I don't think this was a problem with the sender.  However, an effort was made to get it to us quickly which I appreciate.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I found this book to be one of Sparks best books yet. I enjoyed the way it shifted from different characters perspective. This book kept you wondering the whole time and you could never guess what would happen after a series of events. Although he stuck to his romantic theme, this book had a heavy twist on it. It was quite mysterious and more than enjoyable. There were some violent parts though throughout this book but nothing too gruesome. I highly recommended this book for teenage girls and maybe even older  women. No matter who reads this, it's definitely an outstanding read.
B0074D3CAQ|2.0|I haven't had a chance to read this book yet.  Will let you know my rating when I do read it for book club. Did not mean to give it 2 stars, but can't get rid of them.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Tough to put down.  I couldn't wait to see what would happen next.  It ended in a way I did not think would happen.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|There are few movies that I can say are without equal.  Ordinary People is an example among a few others.  The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel gets on my list as one of the best.  On one level the story line is simple, take some people, throw them into a bad situation and watch what happens.  Yet on another level this story is very complex.  One is given a chance to explore right along with the characters how they tackle problems, how they react and interact to each other and to life events they encounter.<br />Part of the pleasure for me was becoming part of the movie as I also explored how I would have reacted, dealt with, and changed as the story progressed.  I found something in each character, even the ones I did not like, that was me.<br />This movie lets you meet “real” people with “real” problems doing their best to cope, survive, and ultimately, live.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Stop what you're doing and read this series! Warning: don't plan on doing anything until you finish the series because it's addicting.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|I loved how it's not your average story and just when your happy for the three children something unexpected happens. This is a very good book if your looking for ironic examples.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Seller delivered very quickly.  I bought Seasons 1 and 2 together and am very glad that I did.  This series gives a glimpse into a time period in history that has been hardly mentioned in popular television and movies.  I LOVE the costumes and changes in house decor as time passes in the story.  Two thumbs up!  I'm sure we'll be buying Season 3 any time now.
B007HACDLK|5.0|The Last Man takes you on a journey with characters you have come to know and appreciate from past books by the author. His characters are well crafted and project a depth that is almost personable. You become an active participant in the twists and turns of the book. The comradery of special forces forges bonds that are unbreakable. The code they live by and the ethic that drives them provides for a safer country. Vince Flynn is one author that consistently turns out well written books with amazing depth and texture. His characters are very human and relatable.

B000W93CHC|5.0|When I first read The Pillars of the Earth three years ago I had no idea what I was getting into. Suffice it to say I was thoroughly impressed by both the story, and the level character of development on Follett's part. Now after finishing the sequel I can say that he continues to deliver just as strong a story as ever. While there are some issues I had with the book I found myself again getting lost in the world that Follett so elegantly crafted. The timing of the story was well placed and we are introduced to an entirely new cast of characters which allows us to gently set aside the ones we are familiar with fondly as we jump two centuries forward. This rather abrupt change in the time periods allows us to grow closer to the new cast and allows for us to follow their development from childhood to adulthood. Something that while present in the previous novel, I felt was too subtle to notice. Also returning in this novel are the various viewpoints from the primary characters all interlocking with each as they did in the first. Now as for the villains in this novel I found that I enjoyed them slightly more than in the original mainly because while we still had the brutes and the schemers they had more personality. We saw the reasoning behind their actions first hand rather than with the first were it was all covered up by smoke and mirrors. This also allows us to connect with these new villains and while yes we despise and hate them for their actions, we also can't help but pity them because we see how conflicted they are in some cases about the consequences of their actions. Regardless of why we like the book I found a worthy successor to the original and worth the time I took reading it.

B00APUQPX6|1.0|No rating - movie did not stream.  My daughter could not see the movie on her Kindle HD - wasted $2.99.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|I feel like this movie is this generation's \\"Bring it On.\\" It's silly, sometimes outrageous, and always entertaining. The music is top notch, Anna Kendrick fits the protagonist bill like a glove, an Rebel Wilson puts in another stand out performance as Fat Amy.<br /><br />I think people sometimes place unnecessary expectations on a movie and then they miss the simple humor and joy that comes out of a young adult comedy. Give Pitch Perfect a chance and you might just be amazed.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Frankly I was curious since everyone was talking about this book, but I was unprepared  for the explicit sexual nature of the writing.  I deleted the book from my Kindle and swore I'd never read another one of these books.  However my friend said they each got a little less shocking so I ended up reading all three.  Certainly not great literature.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I absolutely love this gameI It's just as addictive as Diner Dash! I was looking for a game like this and here it is! Not only do you get to cook the food for the customers you still have to wait tables making the game more challenging and fun! If you love Diner Dash then you'll love this game as well! :)

B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This book is hilarious, it makes it even funnier that this book adds outrageous and embarrassing moments that (sometimes) relate to the story. But this book was too short, same with the rest of the series. It needed to have more funny moments, or at least make them last a little bit longer. Other than that, this book was amazing.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I liked the way the book keeps you guessing till the final words I love the relationship between the characters I would recommend this book to all my friends it was absolutely wonderful

B008AK8FHM|4.0|Eben Alexander was never a bad guy, but his reliance on his education and neurological skill led him to &#34;gently tolerate&#34; stories that patients told about out-of-body experiences.  His own experience when his previously gifted brain was paralized by an ebola form of bacterial meningitis,did not fit with reality as he thought it was..  Experience with universal truth (God) humbled him and created an obsession to testify to all that there is more to who we are than an evolved  bodily organ, the brain.  He wants to convince other &#34;scientists&#34; like he was, so he includes technical details that I skipped.  I was touched when he discovered the identity of the lovely woman who mentored him during his trip through the veil.  .

1401937519|5.0|Discovered this book watching a Dr. Wayne Dyer PBS program.  I wanted it for my mother to provide her inspiration to recover from her illness.  If you believe we are spiritual beings having a human experience, and not the other way around, you will find this story inspirational.
B009EP3DJM|3.0|stumbled upon her through amazon and played her album through spotify.  its actually pretty decent from a lyric perspective and the beats are very catchy.  i think as an artist she has a LOT of talent.    that being said, if you are a believer in God, this is also a perfect example as to why its so important nowadays to watch an artist's videos as well as listen to the record.    Consider the video Die Young: [...]    ..i just cant support an artist when they put out videos like that.  it mocks everything i believe in.  if you are an atheist, i get the fact you dont care about illuminati and satanic symbolism..  but for someone like myself, its offensive and way too widespread in today's society.. especially in pop culture.  this isnt like the 80s and 90s where the only \\"offensive\\" material was \\"sex, drugs, and rock and roll\\".. no.  now you see the screen filled with upside down crosses, triangles, all seeing eye, pentagrams, etc.  i mean, not even Nine Inch Nails got to that level.  they may have put out some controversial and insane videos.. but not on the level as to some of these artists.    if you are a believer in God and like artists such as Kesha, Rhianna, Lady Gaga, Beyonce, etc.  you need to wake up.  13 and 14 year old kids are watching this stuff.  yes, i get it. music, video games, and movies alone wont cause our kids to behave like lunatics.  but can you honestly say you would let your 14 year old daughter watch videos like \\"die young\\"?  well they are all over youtube, MTV, and the music channels.  at the very least, we need to sit down and watch videos with them, have a discussion/debate, show them what the symbolism is, and why its wrong.

B00AIQP9DE|3.0|Very entertaining. Only thing is that i downloaded from amazon app store for free and it is not the full version it looks like. I got to a different level and it just ended...  Would have rated 4-5 if it werent for this.
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|Loved every minute. First ebook on a new Kindle.  Can't wait to download the next installment and begin reading. What a blast?!
B005QPGHQU|5.0|This is a great album from Evanescence. Love her style of music. Great voice. This is one album to own.
B001P59V5Y|4.0|Python takes no prisoners (yet again) in this marvelously intelligent, hilariously historical send-up of the story of Jesus.  Possibly the very height of irreverence, this is the story of Brian of Nazareth, the baby born in the \\"manger next door.\\"  As with most Python, the more you know about the subject being furiously, zanily lampooned (of history, the New Testament, etc.) the more you'll laugh.  Only a bit less tears-rolling-down-your-cheeks funny than Monty Python and The Holy Grail (to this reviewer), The Life of Brian is a must-see for history buffs or students of religion with a sense of humor, anyone who appreciates a bit of creative lunacy, and aspiring Python fans everywhere.

B0050DIWHU|4.0|This book provides great insights of what happens in Silicon Valley, what assets, knowledge are most valuable and wanted in this fast paced industry.  Reading this book gives me sense of urgency to keep myself stay with the current skills and industry.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I really enjoy this show. It takes concepts and events from our history and today, to make a much more compelling story. Even though it is dealing with ghosts and the supernatural, there is a sense of realness that not many other shows can claim to have. If you want are looking for a show that will actually get you thinking, then look no further.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I expected magic spells and wizards. But none of that. Casual Vacancy is about real people and real situations.  No waving of the magic wand.  Amazingly written, JKR shows a whole different side of self in every chapter
B006XBSAP2|4.0|I bought this mainly because I enjoyed Katy Perry's singles from the album, but the rest of it really doesn't hold up. Homogenous to the point where I'd miss that the songs were changing.
B000SEGUDE|1.0|The weird language was hard to understand, by the time I figured out what was going on the story line would change. I haven't seen the movie, from the previews it does looks good, in my opinion I would pass on the book and watch the movie. Not worth the cost of the book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I not much of a reader but I read this whole book in one day. I haven't read a book that grabs me since the Harry potter series

B006BDHAX0|5.0|I am so addicted to this game! Loads of fun. For Mahjong lovers, this is a must have!! 5 stars
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I actually watched the movie first and it did not do the book justice. It's so great and keeps you on your toes and begging for more. I never wanted to put it down (and neither did my boyfriend) lol.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|I give this film 9/10. I'm dropping 1 point because they didn't exactly follow the original &#34;The Ulitmates&#34; story line, but came pretty damned close. The film reflects Joss Whedons Humour with lots of nice humorous, but not out of place , quirky little moments.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book was a fun and quick read.  Good book that is both funny and sad at the same time.  Well written.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|The movie's story may be a little trite, and the big battle at the end between ugly mechanical force and the gorgeous natural world goes on forever, but what a show Cameron puts on! The continuity of dynamized space that he has achieved with 3-D gloriously supports his trippy belief that all living things are one.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|I can't rally say anything negative about this collection. Honestly, it is so well done and exactly as it is heard/seen in the movie adaption. It's fabulous, but I do wish they had included some of the major songs from the motion picture such as Garvoche's solo and Eponine/Marius' duo at the barricade.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This movies was very good. I loved the subject matter and the way they covered it for kids. I purchased this for my 2year old for Christmas and she kind of looses interest after a while, but it takes a lot to hold her attention. Overall great movie!
B009O07NDY|4.0|The song playing at the end of the movie captured my attention and I just had to have it.  I ordered this CD, which is terrific and I got it so fast I didn't even have time to wait for it.
B005LAJ17M|3.0|I had heard a lot about Homeland, so I bought the DVD for the first season.  I saw the first season and thought it was a good show.  More sex and nudity than I had expected, which takes away from my enjoyment but I tolerated it.  The story is reasonably good.  The lead actress is especially good during the later part of the season when she has to go through a major personal transition.  It shows good acting ability.  (I am being vague here so that those who have not seen the season would not have the ending spoiled.)  I preordered season two after watching season one, so it was good enough for me to want to see some more.  I had heard so much about it that I expected better, but it was OK and worth watching.  I'll review season two when I get it.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|how could you not love this show?! it is awesome, okay some parts a little dead, hahahahaha no pun intended...but for the most part, the action (or at least the drama) is pretty nonstop
B00006JIA4|4.0|Queen has so many memorable songs that this is a must to have for anyone who likes one or more of their songs.  (I cannot believe that someone could only like one, but even so.)  The main reason for a slightly less than perfect rating is that the three CD disks have repeat versions of some of the songs, so that one gets duplicates of some of the songs though not necessarily the best of their songs (in my opinion).  Nonetheless, I got what I wanted.  All of their best songs.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|great season so far.  SOOO glad 'certain' people are getting killed off!! yay! Can't wait to see what happens in February!
B009POCG5Y|5.0|I saw this film in the movie theater and ordered the DVD so that I could see it again (and again and again).  I love Clint Eastwood.  The story is good.  By the way, I love baseball as well, even to the point of moving to Cooperstown for a number of years.  So loving Eastwood and baseball makes this film a winner for me.  However, there is more to the story.  It is a counterpoint to Money Ball and shows the problems of a young person (daughter in her 30s) coping with an aging grumpy father (Eastwood).  Such a situation is the case with my brother and his daughters and is probably the case for many younger people these days.  As a result, I bought copies for my brother and each of his two daughters as gifts.  Perhaps it will help them to understand each other better.  So a person gets three stories in one: baseball, problems of aging, and problems of children in dealing with an aging parent.  It's a bargain!
B0011N1WE8|5.0|This movie is a good story and lesson for all ages about liking yourself and not worrying about what others think.

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|good time filler. puzzles we were a blast. graphics looked pretty through entire game. Sharp story kept me entertained. plot developed quickly and interesting for such a quick game. all ages could enjoy but geared toward 10 and up.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|So far has been fun and a bit challenging.  Only negative to the game is that it sometimes seems hard to navigate
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|A &#34;B&#34; movie if I ever saw one!  Plentiful foul language makes this unsuitable for children.  Only redeeming quality is Ted cuteness factor.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Great final book with suspense all the way throughout. Recommend reading the entire series and look forward to the movie adaptations.
0545265355|5.0|It was one of those books I couldn't put down - couldn't wait to see what was next, fast paced.
0316069884|3.0|I was introduced to this book by a campus food activist group. They said it was a great response to Michael Pollan's 'The Omnivore's Dilemma'. Having been moved and engaged by Pollan's book, I wanted to see the 'other' side. This book doesn't specifically refute Pollan in my opinion, which isn't the author's fault (it was the campus group that claimed this). However after having read other books such as Fast Food Nation and the Omnivore's Dilemma and then having watched Food Inc., Super Size Me, etc. I just didn't find myself learning anything substantially new from this book.<br /><br />On a more positive note, this book does a great job of sensitizing you to animal rights and welfare. I think its useful to read for that purpose even if you're not vegetarian(or thinking of becoming one). I did learn some disturbing information about fish farming which will certainly alter my fish eating habits.<br /><br />Overall, the writing style was a bit choppy and not engaging for me. I couldn't make it through the whole book. This review is only for the first part of the book.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Crazy twist. Was nit expecting that. The ending made me laugh but kind of wish it ended with more of a conclusion but the open ending leaves it to your imagination. Crazy!
1400052181|5.0|All through my college life as a cell biology major I learned about and saw many pictures of HeLa cells, never knowing the fascinating story behind them. This book was eye-opening in showing how something so ubiquitous in Biology today had a very real social connection. It calls you to actively question how we know what we know. What are the tools with which so many scientific discoveries were made? Who were the people involved? How were their lives impacted?  In this way the book evoked a whole range of feeling in me - sadness, happiness, awe, anger...In the end the author wisely finished with an afterword that put tissue culture research into perspective. If she hadn't done that I think I would have left the book feeling a lot of anger at the injustices on the Lacks. However using numerous perspectives (that of scientists, physicians, tissue rights groups) she showed how in the world of science (despite it's seemingly 'empirical' 'objective' nature) things are not always black and white, and there aren't always convenient 'good and bad' guys.
B002SR2PKG|3.0|I read this book after watching the movie many years ago. And I was in for a big surprise. I understand that movies deviate from the book but I really didn't expect a specific scene from a group of kids to take place. (If you read the book, you know what I am referring to.)
B000FC10WU|5.0|Love all of her books.  This one was one of her best.  Miss Marple is a genius at human nature.
B0054R6BFM|1.0|The premise of the novel is based on the actions of a selfish character. I fear the repercussions that may result from suicidal individuals, particularly impressionable juveniles and teens, reading this book. Beyond that, as an educator I find it hard to believe that the conversation between Mr Porter and Hannah would have resulted in such manner.
B004NOH9LC|4.0|To put it simply, this is a good movie.  I've been a Television Producer for over 20yrs, and they nail the characters and situations in this film.  I know and have worked with people that are exactly like everyone in this movie.  Yes you sometimes need a zany, talented producer to shake things up. It was also refreshing to see a simple feel good film that had a natural feel without any extreme special effects.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is amazing how you actually feel like your in the book.  The words come to life in your head I love this book!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|The ideas of this book had so much potential, but the writing was terrible. This is one of the few times that I preferred the film over the book because it addressed issues that the book just glossed over despite the importance to the plot. I will not read the sequels.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I received a bunch of great scifi suggestions from my post The Best Science Fiction Books of All Time. One of them was Wool Omnibus Edition (Wool 1 - 5) which I gobbled down the past two days. The writer, Hugh Howey, has an inspirational arc which, if I ever get into writing scifi, I hope I follow.<br /><br />I love post-apocalyptical Earth stories that just dump you into the middle, take off like a shot, and leave it to you to catch up as you slowly piece together what is going on. After a while, you get caught up to the current time and start trying to figure out how we got there. In the case of Wool, Howey stays one step ahead of you, feeding a little big of history a few pages before you need it, which gets you thinking down a new path for a while until just before you need a little more history, at which point he gives it to you.<br /><br />After a hundred pages, I couldn't put it down. We had friends staying over and I ended up on the couch, in a discussion, but sneaking pages when the conversation shifted away from me.<br /><br />As I like to write no-spoiler book reviews, I loved the metaphor of the silo. If very effectively grounds the reality of the world that its citizens inhabit, while leaving open a series of horizontal questions about what the entirety of the world actually is. This doesn't get answered in the first five books (which is what you get with the Omnibus edition) but the world does expand well beyond the silo.<br /><br />I especially love the juxtaposition of politics (the mayor and the sheriff), IT, and mechanical in the arc of the story. Each of the three of these categories of people play critical roles and Hugh mines them extraordinarily well.<br /><br />I've got book 6 and 7 on my Kindle. I'm going to read them after I read Rainbow's End.

B005UBNKWO|5.0|With a new system build and getting newer - hotter running video cards, I wanted to get some processing through put with the highest rated 95 watt processor. This unit fits that bill.<br /><br />I even added the Antec Kuhler H2O 620 Liquid CPU Cooler System to my CPU and inside a stock fanned Corsair Carbide Series Black 500R Mid Tower Computer Case - even while overclocking, I have not seen the CPU temps at or over 50C. It runs so cool I expect this to last and not stress my system at all. It overclocks easy with the right board. I have my set at 3.7 MHz without any effort and no additional heat.<br /><br />I realize the Intel crowd is hard trenched and understand a lot of applications fully utilize their capabilities. But for price performance - you can get an AMD muti-core system, higher end motherboard (Sabertooth 990FX) at about half the cost of Intel chips and boards.<br /><br />Save your money for a higher end. motherboard, video card(s), a couple of hard drive in RAID (I put in a SSD and will swap out when I get a new laptop as I'm not overly impressed), a few more sticks of RAM. I have a comparable system @ $900 that a friend went Intel and paid $1,500 to build ... why? So his can run bench marks at higher rates?<br /><br />I have other uses for my money and utilizing this processor as a core component to build a system around is not a decision I have regretted.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|The best part of this movie was the last 1/2 hour.  The remainder was maudlin and more than a bit boring.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I absolutely fell in love with this story. Victoria is such a dynamic character that anyone can connect with. One of the best books I've read in a long time.
B00A6N8F4Y|1.0|This was terrible -- don't waste your time or money! I can't believe people can actually take this garbage seriously. It was on the verge of embarrassing.
0385535147|4.0|I collect all of Grisham's books and read them time and again.  His characters though troubled, are sympathetic--I find myself rooting for them to have a happy ending.  So many modern novels are full of graphic sexuality and objectionable language, but not Grisham.  I love him for that.  I once heard him interviewed and he stated that he did not want to write anything he would be embarassed for his mother to read!  Good for him!  His works have detailed actions with good character development.  Though I prefer some of his earlier works, this one is well worth reading.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Excellent, excellent, excellent. Talk about ear bugs, this album is full of them. Oh, did I mention excellent? The voice is the thing.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Colleen hoover has an exceptional grasp on life, love, and death. Her characters are so real you find yourself anticipating your next interaction with them. Read this book, it won't disappoint!!
0312427646|5.0|What a delightfully charming book.  It's a quick read, full of humor, with a surprising ending.  It's one of my favorites.
0156012197|5.0|I first read this in high school as a required reading. I laughed at the thought of reading a children's novel at the age of 18, but was soon hushed. The book is an excellent and adoring heart warming book on the surface that children will love for the cute story. Reading it as an adult brings much more depth adding philosophical elements and many thought provoking notions. This is a great book for a child to grow with.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|Avoid this silly book. Very unscientific and very emotionally-based. I saw no proof of heaven just the story of a lucky man.
1439127700|5.0|After reading this book I was even more sure that the 2 party system should be eliminated.  Not really sure how, but it is so disheartening to see how the former Presidents are able to work together and get things done without the influences of their parties.  Politics are dirty business.  Who in their right mind would ever want the job of President.
0345803485|5.0|I doubted this book when I first saw it , however After reading It It was great. The suspense , unanswered questions , characters are awesome . I can't wait to read the last 2 books (:
0425263916|5.0|I loved the story line and the romance.  It is a great book for someone looking for a story like 50 shades.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy game to play to kill time.  Solitaire never gets old - good for all ages.  My go to game when I'm bored.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love it its great, I've read all 3 books and cannot wait for the rest of the movies to come out!
0385535147|5.0|I think I have to go back and read it again .... got totally surprised toward the end! Thanks, Grisham!
B00A3AYI50|5.0|I'm  glad I bought the whole album,  all the songs are good.  I hope he has a long career. cool
B004XGN8W4|5.0|My wife bought this for my for my deployments for Father's Day 2012 and I couldnt be happier.<br />It fits in my locker on the ship, and open, it fits just fine on my rack.<br /><br />It's not to large of an item (for such close quarters), and even with a PS3, it is not all that heavy.<br /><br />That said, she did not notice that it would fit a PS3 slim, but not a PS3.  However, by taking out the foam padding, the PS3 fits fine, strapped in and all.  The case top is still able to close without causing any pressure on the PS3 or the monitor inside.<br /><br />In close quarters, these two combined do form a heater, but this is really only noticeable at my rack.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great item, and I would even recommend to those with a PS3 (not slim).
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|To be honest, I only bought Slammed over the summer because I had the same name as the author. However I ended up loving it along with Colleen's second book.<br /><br />However 'Hopless' topped Slammed a thousand times, if that's even possible. It was impeccable, after every word I was longing for more. It was so pure, and I fell in love with every character. I felt like I've known each and every character my whole life. And the storytelling was perfection. Every last detail allowed me to envision it clearly in my head. I felt every emotion the characters were feeling, I cried with them, I laughed with them. I feel so attached that how can I ever read a book again and enjoy it!?<br /><br />Its a MUST READ.<br /><br />Amazing work Colleen. Please keep the books coming, your work never seems to disappoint.
B0070Y46UY|2.0|This was my first book on Kindle and it wasn't what I expected.  Knowing that it had already been made into a movie, I just couldn't imagine them bringing it to life as some parts were gross
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I could not put down this book. Every pa left me wanting more. It is one of the best books I have read in a while!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This one didn't grab and hold my interest.  Usually I am anxious to get to the end and find out what happens but this one moved slower to the final conclusion.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I haven't been able to put it down since I've started reading...i think my husband may hide my kindle from me.  I am loving this so far!
B00424F4JC|5.0|Fun for whole family! Not as complicated as chess, but more strategy than checkers!!! Many different ages can play together.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was so good. I just could not stop reading it. It just kept pulling me in, wanting to find out more. On to the last book
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I mad that it ended! I wanted more, I couldn't go to sleep until I finished the chapter and it turned into the next one and then the next one and so on.
B00AA0TJO8|3.0|Thanks For Making This A Free App Of The Day But I Need Help I Cant Seem To Pass The Third Level But Anyway Its Great I Am Lucky Because I Got It For Free I Wouldnt Buy It If I Were You Only Because It Cost Actual Money
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I was a BIG star wars fan when I was little, I saw this app and I needed to get this, I know 2.99 is a lot to pay for an app but this is now my favorite game. I highly recommend this game to everyone, I played this non-stop. totally worth the money.
B008PE9GSA|4.0|...is not the classic ZZ Top I was hoping for.  It is a good album though and I'm very appreciative of the fact ZZ Top is still going strong (as evidenced by their concert this past summer).
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is a great movie. It actually has acting in it! Not just a bunch of special effects. Nice ensemble cast.
B009DB60W4|4.0|Supposedly the last album fromTherion for a bit while Christopher is working on his opera.  I was not too enthused with this album.  I'm hoping it will grow on me, but the french theme (and feel) to the music is just not the Therion I have been listening for the past ~20 years.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|This is a fun game and entertaining game keeping your brain thinking about the gravity and consequences.  The graphics are basic but remain vivid in the game. It is a lot of fun I recommend this game for all ages.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Thank you Andy for a great read, I thoroughly enjoyed the story, sharing the character's very potentially real problems and on going dramas, little things we just all take for granted become major issues. Well researched, again thank you, and just loved the ending !
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I have always enjoyed this type of game. Good scenes, not too easy, and fun. The only downside to this is the ads and the game automatically shuffling for you. I will definitely continue to play this game.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|It was an awesome book,but did not pic in up till the second part. Very graphic too, not for young readers. But really, it's a great and exciting book
1449410243|5.0|love this book always a way to get a smile or even consider watching my own cats to see what they are doing
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Book four in the ongoing saga of Martin's captivating story of heroic men and women and the despicable machinations of power hungry people.  Highly recommend this series of books to the fans of sword and sorcerey genre.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|HD video with no commercials, however could not rewind and fast forward as well as I liked. Still good though.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|He never disappoiants.  I( probably have 60+ ChriSTMAS  CD'S  AND THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST ONE EVER.  I love Rod Stewart.

B000ID37LS|5.0|wonderful characters and story line.  a movie you can watch multi times.  no boring sceen and a great stay at home dinner movie
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think it is great it is everything hope it would be ;) get it is great pricey. but good
B009NPKTN6|1.0|I love musicals, but this was horrible.  The singing was mediocre at best and the acting was unbelievably bad.  Neither the comedic nor the dramatic scenes worked.  Mary J. Blige was the only strong performance in a terrible movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I played this with my 7 year old grandson. We were laughing so hard the whole time we were playing. It is difficult but so funny and great for a child.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|I didn't expect this movie to be hilarious.  It was really funny, touching, and I totally recommend it to everyone.
B003XMAD3G|5.0|I bought this item because I needed to upgrade my netbook ACER AO which came in with 1GB only and it got a bit faster after installing the 2GB memory. kingston is a very known brand you can trust when it comes to high performance. I'm totally satisfied with this purchase.I recommend it if you are planning upgrading either your netbook or notebook.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Interesting approach to fix a stale marriage.  Probably a better ending than what would happen in real life.  Some funny moments.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|I received this dvd still brand new and for an amazingly low price. I gave it to my friend for christmas and she loved it!
B008L1DNGI|1.0|Too confusing, got bored easily. My husband loves it though, he said he liked this game when he was a kid. Must be one of the throwback things he really digs.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|The story itself was quite extreme. There was a lot of unexpected descriptive death. I recommend this book the non animal lover. I felt sorry for every animal that died or was killed. This will be the cause of my nightmares.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I love this game, not only is it aesthetically pleasing, its fun and keeps your brain active. I have recommended this to all my Android using friends and family!!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|thanks  amazon for giving  free games, this is one of my favorites.<br />i'm just learning how to use my tablet and before i purchase my other favorite games  i'm trying the free ones.<br />If you haven't checked out the free and paid games you should amazon has some great choices.<br />glad to say there are no &#34;cons&#34;
B005LAIHZY|1.0|Garbage.  Won't play in any of the 3 DVD players tried.  Only work in a PC.  Now we have to have someone  rip a copy to play it while the kids wait.  This is why people pirate movies!  Could have downloaded in less time.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|If you have a nexus 7 tablet you need this to download books from your local library.<br />so glad amazon gives this download for free (thanks folks)
1439102430|5.0|Love all of Kathy Reichs books!! It is amazing that she can keep me reading into the night because I just can not find a stopping place.  Again her writing is so detailed and entertaining.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I was looking for a nice leather case for my Kindle - something that would look nice if I pulled it out at a business conference. This fits the bill. It's a nice black leather case that works exactly how you think (it's a leather case, how hard does it get!?)  This has two little features that make it stand out a bit. First, the interior hard shell plastic case rotates 90 degrees so you can stand your kindle up. The second is an elastic strap that fits around the two sides to keep the case from flipping open.<br /><br />There are only two little complaints - neither big enough to warrant losing a star. First, the leather had a very potent leathery smell. If you don't mind a new leather coat or the smell of a new car, this won't bother you. The second is one time (ONCE) the interior case inexplicably failed and my Kindle slipped out. I'm almost certain it was in there correctly, but my 1 year old could've been playing with it, so I'll chalk this up to user error and not design defect.<br /><br />Overall, this case performs just like you'd expect. It looks good and is completely functional. As long as you don't have a particularly delicate nose, I'd recommend it.
0865479410|2.0|I wanted to like this book and learn from it. I really did. Unfortunately, try as I might, it didn't happen.<br />I am inclined to agree for the most part with Andy Rosenblum's one-star review of this book, but I am willing to be a bit kinder and at least give the book two stars. After all, it wasn't completely useless or terrible.<br />Overall, the author seems to have a fascination with tracking down cynics and curmudgeons who, for whatever reason, seem to have a strong dislike for positive thinking. These individuals try to make their lives work, and, maybe their lives actually do work, but the author didn't seem to have much success finding many of these people who actually seemed to be really happy.<br />A second major shortcoming of the book is that the author spent way too much time with \\"local color\\" - providing detailed descriptions of places he visited, what people were drinking when he interviewed them, and lots of other information that, while it might have had some value if he were writing a novel, added nothing to the philosophical points he was trying to make in this book.<br />Some other minor comments:<br />- Early in the book, he makes the claim that none of the major religions have a focus on happiness, and then spends a lot of time talking about Buddhism. Indeed, Buddhism is definitely a negative religion. The basic tenet seems to be, \\"Life in general stinks most of the time (suffering is standard fare), but every once in awhile, if you meditate enough, you might experience brief moments of happiness. One religion he fails to mention at all is Hinduism, which has a strong focus on happiness. One of the basic tenets of Hinduism is that happiness is (or should be) man's natural state. If people don't experience continuous happiness, it is because of some \\"clutter\\" that they have allowed into their minds and/or lives, and that getting rid of the clutter will uncover one's basic nature of happiness.<br />- And, like a lot of today's \\"pop\\" authors, heseems to love to slam self-help books and their authors, claiming, in a number of different ways, that such books are useless, by suggesting that the reason people keep buying self-help books is because the ones they have previously read didn't do any good. Actually, a lot of self-help books are extremely useful, but only if the readers actually do what the books instruct them to do. The problem is that most \\"self-help book junkies\\" are people who read book after book, hoping their lives will miraculously change simply by reading the books, and not realizing that they actually have to put the work into doing what the books say. It's akin to someone complaining that they read a dozen cookbooks, but that they are still hungry. Hey, you actually have to go to the work to cook the recipes! Just reading the books won't fill your belly! So, the problem isn't always useless books. It is often lazy readers.<br />- He also seems to suggest that one reason people lack happiness today is because of difficulty in experiencing spirituality, and he cites two reasons for this, one being from Alan Watts, who suggested that the increased popularity of science has reduced the potential to experience spirituality. The author then goes on to say that people who are disillusioned with their regular religions have the choice of either going back to them to try to experience spirituality, an endeavor, he suggests, that would be silly, because such people left those religions because they stopped believing them anyway; or simply giving up hope of experiencing spirituality. The author thus leaves out some completely viable options for experiencing spirituality, such as going on a quest for spirituality without religion at all, or immersing oneself in some of the Eastern religions, which focus much more on spirituality than on rule-bound religious creeds.<br />- Along the same lines, he devotes a whole chapter to people's fear of death and trying to figure out a way around this, again, completely ignoring Eastern religions, whose devotees rarely fear death. The reason, largely, is that devotees of Western religions believe you only go around once, whereas devotees of Eastern religions believe in reincarnation, so there is little to fear when one physical life ends.<br />- All of this leads me to believe that, while the author did travel to different cities and countries to interview various people for his book, he seems to have an extremely limited grasp of the vast majority of happiness literature (psychological and otherwise) and the vast majority of positive philosophies and spiritual alternatives that can lead, and have led, millions of people to happiness, fulfillment, contentment, and more.<br />Anyway, while I suspect there are a few readers who might learn something useful from this book, I don't think the majority of people would find a route to happiness by utilizing the ideas suggested by this author.
B000002ACR|5.0|This is another must have winner. Once again roger and the guys do nothing but, make great and wonderful music.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have had no problems with this.  I purchased an ASUS tablet and wasn't sure about all the apps since it wasn't a brand name table.  No problems! I am enjoying my books, especially at the lower prices!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this reminds me of a space relation test I had to take years ago, good for the brain and memory....
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I first read Colleen's work in Slammed and POR, This so I was excited to read Hopeless...This is a touching story with great comic relief--that truly caught me off guard. I found myself laughing out loud all over the place. Even as the story depends and their relationship is tested, the humor is still there.<br /><br />Normally I'm looking for the steamy scenes and when their first kiss doesn't come until after 35% in I didn't care. You're so consumed with the two of them doing this thing the right way, that you're right there with Holder and his views on the first kiss.<br /><br />Loved it from beginning to end and wow it's nice to read a standalone book with a great ending. Thank you Colleen.
B00ADYYBFI|4.0|There were a few songs I could do without, but, for the most part, it is a good soundtrack.  Enjoy!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love this app. Love how you just tap the card and not have to drag it. It's a great game.
0345522478|5.0|Unfortunately the urban fantasy genre has been overrun by the romance crowd... and they are for the most part horribly written bodice rippers. Finally another male writer has stepped in and given us guys something to read in the genre (I don't mean to be sexist I just can't stand romance!!). With large amounts of humor, nerdity, swashbuckling, wisecracks, lawyer werewolves, butthead fairies this a series thats hard not to love!!! Not to mention it's a different take on the same old thing so it's a bit of fresh air in an otherwise stuffy genre (fantasy) considering how many \\"epic\\" trilogies are now being self published on Amazon now. Not that all of them are bad but epic has gotten less so with the plethora of subpar offering lately.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was SOOO bummed that this is the final book.... I really enjoyed reading The Hunger Games&#34; although I didn't think I would.... I thought it was a &#34;Kids&#34; book, WELL, it isn't....IT is a book for anyone who loves to read and it kept me rivited and interested!! Sorry it ended  :(
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Nice gritty adult fantasy... Wish we had more stuff like this to read but gems like this are few and far between. Hope the next one comes out soon so I can reread the first one again!!
B0070Y46UY|3.0|This book is detail orientated.  It covers the  habits of animals, many religious feelings, and his survival, each part an education.
0756407125|5.0|Love this series... Only thing wrong with it was how looOOOOOooong it took for the second book to come out. Anyways I won't go into descriptions due the fact that others have done that ad nauseum I am just chipping in to say a brilliant read and neener neener to all that gave it a single star!!!!
B00631VJIC|5.0|This CD is a comprehensive one with almost ALL of the music from all the Sons episodes. Really good old rock with a mix of a little soul...a &#34;comforting&#34; CD. I bought this one along with Volume 2 and together, I feel like I have some of the BEST Sons episodes right in the palm of my hands. If you love Sons, you WILL love this CD, no questions asked.....BUY THIS ONE!
0756405890|5.0|Patrick has written a masterpiece of fantasy IMHO... I haven't enjoyed a book this much for a long time (read it twice so far and will read it again when the third book finally comes out) I wont go into any descriptions cause others have done that plenty... I am just chipping in on how good this series is!!!
1452101426|3.0|the artwork in this movie is exquisite.  the book shows more behind how the artists and techs created the landscapes and much less, it feels to me, about the development of the characters and their body builds and movements.  I doubt i will be keeping this one.
0316069426|5.0|As feisty and anti establishment as ever, Harry B does not fail to please. While formulaic and predictable, this is neverless another riveting page turner.
0307279189|5.0|A story plus with an education in how less is more.  This book has more meaning since one of the character really lived the kind of life that he wanted which was in the news this last April 2012.
B005RUV0NY|5.0|I love this series and this is the first TV series I have purchased from Amazon. I was happy that I could download episodes on my iPad to watch while I travel.
B00499K9E0|5.0|love the show, witty and a modern version of the original stories. I have not seen any of the other Sherlock Holmes shows, but I would defiantly recommend this one to any fan.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I enjoy the app. However resetting after a failed level can often be rather slow. Also exact same angle with exact same bird can produce very different trajectories. Frustrating.<br />But overall...delightful way to blow time.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Just a look at the cast list is enough to convince that this film will be a delight.  But the script provides an upbeat, if somewhat predictable, tale that entertains and has the mandatory happy ending.<br />The mixture of modern and ancient India makes the cinematography a joy to watch.<br />This film delivers exactly what it promises and was enjoyed by myself, my wife and our four children age 11 to 17.
B0027MJU00|5.0|You will need to read it all in one day. Loved it!!<br /><br />Loved the characters and quirky quotes best author
B008EZVNO0|5.0|been waiting for a very long time for a new albem by Van the Man and here it is it woth the money to get this albem yes and for long drives in the car it nice on the road so give it a listen and you'll like it to
B000005J56|5.0|Great CD, love the music, nice combination of jazz and soulful music from the little island south of Miami. Highly recommend
B0084TWN9K|5.0|My heading says it all.<br />And here are fifteen more words that Amazon requires to complete this review. Thank you !
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST Mahjong ON THE MARKET! I like the different levels and options. Better than the computer version.
B003TJMY0S|4.0|As long as you don't take it too seriously, its a good story. Can't see how it's based after the book of the same name is a big stretch though
B002NZTZ8S|1.0|So I went to customer support and they tried to tell me it was my fault.  So I just went to another site and selected the 3d copy and it played fine...in 3d!  Sorry Amazon, I love your site, but when I do a search for 3d titles, then rent it and it doesn't display in 3d...you should just refund my money and not make a big deal out of it.
B001RTCP1A|5.0|Great blu ray disc & unrated extended cut version of sci-fi monster movie Pitch Black. Solid action movie starring Vin Diesel. The extended scenes are not more action/monster sequences, but they do add a bit more individual character stuff and background to the story.
B003NX76BM|5.0|I just finished the book and I felt compelled to review it. I am a HUGE fan of Nora Roberts, but I have to say, this has been my absolute favorite!<br /><br />Yes, it gets very detailed in regards to dog training. For me, as an owner of a 120 pound Akita,that was a BONUS! While some might find it a stretch, I felt the dog training portions could be translated into other aspects of ones life.<br /><br />I came to admire the very strong female character, who would not allow her self to be a victim. Fiona took her horrible experience and used it to shape her life and future in a positive way. I love how Nora takes us on that journey and inspires us all, on some level, to be stronger too...at least, that's how I felt ;)<br /><br />My title should read \\"A Must Read for Dog Lovers...and Designers and Creatives too.\\" I thought Simon's character, as an artist, was well developed. I found Nora's detailed description of his creative process interesting and relatable.<br /><br />Lastly, I felt this book was very well rounded...with the requisite nail biting action, character interaction, romance, and humor. I sometimes feel ripped off at the end of a book when I'm done reading it, however I felt this one was worth every penny. I will definitely recommend it to family and friends!
B0086700CM|4.0|I downloaded this app only because I kept seeing it show up in the app world. So, I decided to download it and see what it was about.<br />I do like that it shows you how to play the game before you actually play it.<br />It's fast paced and addictive. My only problem is, I'm a girl who loves competition. Aside from competing with myself to beat my highest score.<br />I would like it if there were levels instead of just continuously running around the same temple over and over again. It does get quite boring after a while!
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|This is a very good debut album I was very impressed with an American Idol winner that actually has true talent , a little on the mellow side but Phil is really good
B008K9SG9K|3.0|I really like this band.  Discovered them through 'It's Time' and 'Radioactive' on AltNation XM radio, but the rest of the album is pretty good too.  Less great as the album goes on, but still a great listen overall.<br /><br />As for the physical product?  NOT handled with care.  Front cover was scratched and cracked.  CD was luckily okay.
B0086700CM|5.0|I was told about this game by a colleuge at work and I found it when I got my Kindle fire, very fun game highly addictive and it's free and you never win or lose just keep playing and it challenges you more and more
B007TNS6JI|4.0|the game is beautifully designed in all aspects, minus of course the repetitiveness of levels, as well as the impossibility of some higher rank objectives. a very entertaining play though.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|Samantha Barks is amazing. Favorite song on the album! I hope they release a full version of the soundtrack; I'm assuming that will come eventually. I will say that the movie is better than the soundtrack. This is because they sang while they were acting, so the emotions, the talking, and the crying are all for the art of film-making, not for audio. I love love love the soundtrack though. Just keep in mind it's not like a broadway production where everyone is pitch-perfect.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|It is very much worth purchasing all three movies in this set! The price is great and the quality of the movies is great as well!
6305428352|5.0|This is a great movie, I had quick shipment on this item, which helped me get it in time for the holidays. Excellent inspirational movie love true stories
B00APUQPX6|3.0|Entertaining but it seemed like they're running out of ideas for the series. The other movies in the series are better. I wouldn't own it.
0545265355|5.0|This is a fun series of books this set was well wrapped and was great quality had a nice look
B000VHMF0A|5.0|Everyone should own this album.  Not just fans of reggae or Bob Marley.  Everyone.  This is the single greatest collection of his greatest hits, and these songs are outrageously good.  There are many different flavors of reggae and pop (and everything in between) represented here, so there is something for everyone regardless of your individual tastes.  Get it!
B007T9UIMA|5.0|Appreciate the quick shipment excellent product, my young lady loved this video and anyone who is a fan will enjoy this product
B008DVJMAW|5.0|I first heard of this band on NPR recently and was very impressed when I finally got to listen to their catalogue.  My wife nailed it when she said that the songs sounded familiar even on her first listen.  They aren't derivative at all, but their influences are clear- distinctly southern rock with a healthy dose of blues and modern country.<br />The lyrics are fairly clever and the themes of the songs are pretty familiar for this genre- urban vs. country life, love and loss, family issues, etc.<br />Anyone who likes Zac Brown Band, Lynyrd Skynyrd, or other similar acts would do well to give this a listen.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great second season for one of the only interesting television series going bar none.  My family enjoyed the historical portrayal.
B003HC8I5M|4.0|I bought this album for my wife. She really likes it. High quality reproduction of the old songs. These songs, chosen by Phil Collins, are his favorites he listened to when he was growing up. They obviously left a huge impression on him - as we are the recipients of his excellent songs over the years that are very R&B driven. Some songs are well known by most people although a lot of the others may be only appreciated and/or remembered by the true Motown music lovers. Today's generation may only have heard a few of these, although they would greatly benefit from hearing all the rest. A few of the musicians that recorded these songs on this album actually were there for the original recordings of most of the songs. So, that was pretty cool. I highly recommend this album to all true Motown music lovers.

B00023BLXA|5.0|If you don't want a deep, thought-provoking movie, this is the show for you.  It's light, it's fun and it's happy.  It's just as first love ought to be, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The series itself is simply wonderful. My rating is more on the Amazon Prime Instant Video. We're using a Roku machine to stream the videos, HD looks like 720 quality HD, no issues streaming.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie, go get it now!  I love this happy, fun and entertaining movie.  The soundtrack is perfect except for one detail!  I was disappointed that Titanium was not on the soundtrack - that's such a funny scene in the movie and love how Chloe and Beca harmonize.  No matter, I have the movie, too, and can listen to it at home.  My kids love the soundtrack, too.
B005FISBTO|2.0|two of the four discs had problems breaking up digitally....picture froze several times....one 5 minute segment, there was no sound...I was disappointed.  I am very particular and did not touch the DVD & saw no marks or fingerprints on the discs.  I'd purchased years 1-5 last year and had no problems.

B00AJRQLTI|5.0|It was five dollars, and prefaces with the word \\"highlights\\" ...why even think to complain?! My only problem is with \\"On My Own\\" because it cuts off the last word, unless you listen consecutively. That's the only criticism of my purchase. Other than that, it's much more than I paid for!
B008XNZMOU|4.0|Got this as a Christmas gift for my fourteen-year old sister. The first time I ordered it, I never received it from the seller, went to contact the seller, and got told that the seller had left the marketplace. I then proceeded to contact Amazon, explained the situation, and they were very understanding, and let me order a copy from them with a credit of the amount for the CD in my account. I was guaranteed delivery by Christmas and got it on Christmas Eve. I am very satisfied with the fast response and delivery from Amazon, and my sister is very satisfied with her Christmas gift.
B009JBZH54|3.0|Unfortunately, this trilogy does not allow a viewer the chance to watch the 3rd movie (The Dark Knight Rises) in a consistent 2.35:1 ratio. This common cinematic ratio is used in most \\"widescreen\\" films on DVD and Blu-Ray. Throughout the 3rd film, the format will change from 16:9, then to 2.35:1, then to 16:9 again.<br /><br />This is a disappointment to have the Trilogy released with such a blatant flaw.<br /><br />Edit: Below, I've been told that this is not a flaw but a purposeful act based on filming some scenes in 35mm and some on IMAX standard. I do not see how this solves the problem of moving from 2.35:1 to 16:9 and back; after all, it is a problem. One expects when purchasing these movies to see one ratio the entire time. We're not watching full-screen here anymore where the movie's story is shown in 4:3 and then the credits roll in 16:9.

B008XG1X18|4.0|So happy when the version became available for my kindle fire. I can finally easily pin my posts without &quot;liking&quot; a ton of them then sorting them later. Only wish that when I reopen the app my feed was already refreshed and didn't have to use the back button so much.
B000HT3PPG|3.0|THE CD WAS FINE TO OKAY. THE BEST PART ABOUT HAVING THE CHRISTMAS CD WAS THE COMMENTARY WITH THE CD.

B00A80SHFM|5.0|This is a wonderful soundtrack! Every Les Miz fan should buy this for their collection!! Hugh Jackman, Anna Halfway, and Russell Crowe are amazing in the soundtrack!! I haven't seen the movie, I am about to cry because of the singing of the actors. If the sountrack can do that image what its going to be like when I go and see the movie!!
B00A7CI82I|3.0|Good try, but didn't hit the mark.  I completely understand why they made this movie and was really hoping it's surprise me.  It didn't.  I found it predictable and occasionally boring.  Too bad they burned down that gorgeous old house...bummer.

B007FH9GA6|4.0|Wife and I have watched the Swedish trilogy a couple times and genuinely enjoyed them.  We were reluctant to watch yet another American bastardization of an already well done film/series.  Happily surprised how well done this was and genuinely different than the Swedish renditions.  Highly recommend!

B0030B624E|3.0|Yet another twist on the over saturated zombie movie genre.  I watched it twice to see if I'd &#34;appreciate&#34; the movie more, didn't really help.  Any-who, not for kids, but not a gore-fest like some of it's counterparts.

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Awesome game.  Good story line and game play that is very smooth flowing. Looking forward to playing more of your games!
B009D0LBRO|3.0|This game has amazing graphics they look almost like Rayman Origins (Same engine here I believe). However the frame rate on the kindle fire HD is so wildly out of control (even the timer slows and speeds up) it makes this twitch jumper very hard to play.<br /><br />It's hard to recommend this to anyone in the current game state.. 3 stars until they hopefully patch it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing book and story.I recommend you get the audio book and read at the same time! Read this in a week!
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|Similar to quell.. the object of the game is to join the pudding monsters together without spilling them off the table. There is a basic introduction to the game mechanics and it is very easy to pick up and play.<br /><br />Graphics on the HD are bright and colorful and no frame rate issues to note. Worth the dollar to support the makers of now three excellent games.<br /><br />The only negative I can speak of is sometimes it takes two swipes to move the desired way.. something that can be remedied with a fix I think.<br /><br />Edit: Game center states this game tracks achievements... it also shows the list of them but at this time, it appears to be broken in game. Just FYI for achievement people.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|once I started playing it kind of &quot;dragged out too long&quot; but I stuck it out and got hooked into the story line!  A few of the puzzles and things to figure out were almost impossible without googling the cheat forums!  an occasional cheat would let move along without frustration.  I definately would play nevosoft games again! !!
B0084AZXKK|5.0|The five star rating is for the fact this book is a timeless adventure classic. I enjoyed the progression of not only Jim but John and the doctor as well. I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants a piece of the past that will survive to any decade.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is one of the most exciting game I've played in a long time.  This is the game I play when I'm at the boardwalk.  You run out of coins quickly, but they're given back in time.  You also win prizes, that you can trade in for more coins.  There are different coins to get, pieces of the puzzle that you are trying to complete.  Love it.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I fell in love with Mitch Albom with Tuesday's with Morrie and the Time Keeper is another best! I spent less than a day reading it and still think about the implications and lessons from this book. This book is a rare one that I will read multiply times.

B005LAIH4A|4.0|I kind of loved `Horton Hears a Who'.  It was fun and exciting and beautifully colored, and the moral and slight nod to deeper things (like belief in God) was expertly played to not be preachy but inspiring.  With that hanging over my head, I was really excited to see what `The Lorax' had to offer.  Being Seuss's ode to nature preservation, I had actually never read the book, but the movie looked cute and charming and so I wanted to see it.<br /><br />It was cute and charming, but little else.<br /><br />The film tells the story of young Ted living in Thneedville, a town made completely of plastic that has no natural growth and an atmosphere so dire the townsfolk are forced to buy bottled air by a zillionaire who keeps a close watch on the town to make sure that no one interferes with his money-making schemes.  The thing is, the town is perfectly ok with their manufactured lives and never bats an eyelash at the problems they seem to be facing.  Ted is in love with Audrey, who dreams of trees, and so he makes it his goal to find her one.  With the help of his crazy grandmother, Ted travels outside the city walls and meets the Once-ler who informs him of how Thneedville got its start and what Ted needs to do to save it from itself.<br /><br />He has to plant a seed.<br /><br />The color palate is pleasant, the jokes are plenty and the musical numbers are snappy and yet at the end of it all I felt like `The Lorax' was somewhat stagnant in its message.  The situation in Thneedville was too boisterous to warrant change and I found that the ending seemed almost out of nowhere, with people realizing that nature was important.  It just didn't feel like it ever really explained to us or even showed us why this was such a big deal.  I understand why it was, and I totally understand the importance of preserving nature, but I just didn't feel like `The Lorax' represented that properly.  The story told was interesting and funny and cute and overall very entertaining, but it didn't say all that it intended to, at least not in my opinion.  Still, I recommend it to families because it will entertain the entire family.'t say all that it intended to, at least not in my opinion.

B003ODIZL6|5.0|This book was very informative and I enjoyed this book very much because it taught me about words and origins.
B008KEQMDC|1.0|I'm not sure that I was expecting a good movie, since this looked so bland and stupid in the trailer, but then again my wife thought it was hilarious when she went to see it in the theaters with her girlfriends and so I gave it a shot.  There came a point where I decided I was only finishing it so that I could write a nasty review about it; it's that bad.<br /><br />My issue with movies like this is that they come across so un-genuine that they lose any and all credibility.  The actors are all atrocious, with not one performance feeling inspired or even remotely authentic and the jokes are a tired list of regurgitated scenarios and one liners that don't hit but maybe once every thirty minutes.  This hodgepodge of baby-related storylines is borderline insulting in the overboard, nonsensical way it paints parenthood and the pursuit of.  And please, I beg of you, stop casting Chris Rock in movies.  Whoever convinced you that it was a good idea should be fired.  He's not funny anymore.  His humor hasn't changed since the late 90's and he is no longer relevant.  Forget about him.<br /><br />To spell out the different storylines would take all day, since there are too many of them and they are all sort of carbon copies of each other with fragments of difference to give them seeming life, but basically you have five couples with baby on the brain.  Two couples have an accidental pregnancy, two couples are competing throughout their pregnancy and one couple has to adopt.  The acting is what ruins a lot of this, with Matthew Morrison mugging his way through every line (why is he always trying to be `warm' and `seductive' to the point where he's creepy?), Quaid falling on his face and the entire list of female performers hamming it up in a way that insults their talent.  Oh yeah, and Chris Rock being Chris Rock, complete with outdated rap music to accompany his entrance.  But it's not only the actors.  The writing is pathetic.  The jokes are expected and the development of character is a mess.  Also, miscarriages are not funny so don't put them in a comedy.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I hated this.  It tries to throw way too many ideas out there that it becomes a muddled mess with barely a sliver of anything to tell the storylines apart, other than different faces doing the yelling.  Parenthood is a beautiful thing.  It isn't always easy, and pregnancy sure isn't a cakewalk (the wife's been pregnant three times, all different with their unique set of difficulties) and yet something about `What to Expect When You're Expecting' feels so false and one-note.aracter is a mess.

B008JFLWLE|3.0|This is a fun app to play around with!  You can write your calculations and it will answer them for you.  I think it takes less time than a regular calculator.<br /><br />It does fudge up occasionally, especially with more complex problems, but it is fun to toy around with.

B004TI5N38|5.0|Great read. I finished this one in about 3 sessions of reading.  I definitely recommend this book to all suspense fans.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|The movie was not original, I felt like I was watching Jason Bourne all over again, but he wasn't as clever. The movie was very predictable and they didn't do as much with the storyline as they could have.  Had a lot of potential, didn't work out very well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best book I have ever read. So much more detail than the motion picture and helps y you understand more.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game is awesome!! I have the computer version, which I love and play repeatedly. So when I saw there was a version for the smartphone, I HAD to get it. The gooballs are a little harder to manipulate than on the computer version, but it is still a very fun game. It is actually a little more challenging than the computer version. This will take me a long time to defeat, which is what I look for in games.

B0058YPL66|5.0|I live this series.  Buying the the whole season is a reasonable expense because the memory forgets, didn't focus or whatever the first or second time you saw some of these episodes.  I really enjoyed watching it all straight through.  BUY IT!

B007RTAR64|5.0|There have been a lot of dolls made that don't look enough like the real-life famous person for you to tell it's them if their identifying clothes are off. This doll made me say \\"wow!\\" out loud when I opened the Amazon box and saw the doll for the first time.  It really does look like Jennifer Lawrence's Katniss from the movie, and the doll captures her beauty and intrepid hardiness.<br /><br />I love the textures and the detail in her clothing. The Barbie folks did a fantastic job with this doll. This is truly a heroine that I am proud to put into the hands of my daughter.

0525958002|4.0|This autobiography is a must-read for any \\"John girl.\\"  I highly recommend getting the e-book so that you can take advantage of all the audio and video clips that have been embedded in it.  Leave it to the founder of Duran Duran to put out a book with such a creative use of multi-media to tell the story of his life, just as the band has always been a combination of music, art, fashion and theater.  John adds his own commentary to several sections of the book in video clips, which is very gratifying.<br /><br />If you were an ardent collector of \\"Duran-o-belia\\" as a teen like I was, hungrily digesting articles from BOP magazine and pasting the clippings and photos into your scrapbook, you will love this book, because it provides even more before-unseen information about John's formative years, the creation of Duran Duran and their rise to fame.<br /><br />John's childhood is really the story of the creation of a rock star.  John, a nerdy, bespectacled only-child and poor student had a single-minded focus on music.  The very drive that leads him to dedicate all of his energies to the making it in the music business is ultimately his undoing when he can't find anything non-destructive to do in his spare time.  With ambitious goals to make it to Madison Square Garden in 4 short years, he feeds D2 to the teen fan machine and the music video world, which both propel the band to supergroup status and undermine their credibility as legitimate artists.<br /><br />Central to the story are John's parents, John and Jean, who gave John his Catholic upbringing and a great amount of latitude to pursue his dreams of music.  Though his relationship with them suffered at the hands of his addictions, it was touching to see how he was able to reconnect with them post-treatment and be fully present toward the ends of their lives.<br /><br />This book is not a tell-all - far from it.  As others have said, there are no salacious groupie stories or airing of dirty laundry about the band.He still has to play with those guys, after all.  There are clearly parts of his life that he doesn't want to put on display out of respect for those close to him.  So we don't have the full story, but that's OK.  \\"The English Way,\\" as he himself calls it, is not to be too open.  He even acknowledges 93% of the way through the book that he is a bit of a tease.<br /><br />But he knows that Duran Duran fans always want more, more, more \\"stuff\\" and he does give you some precious things  - previously unpublished photos, rare musical snippets, stories from his childhood, his thoughts on sobriety and spirituality.  This is all he can give at this time in his life. And maybe it's a good thing to keep a little bit of mystique.  Coming up in the early 80s, before the Internet and TMZ, allowed him to go through his personal trials without a great amount of public scrutiny. So we didn't know everything about him before and we still don't.  He will turn on that spigot himself if he ever feels the need to.<br /><br />Still, it is an excellent, beautifully written accounting of the still-going era of Duran Duran and John's place in it. It was so interesting to learn how the two \\"sidemen,\\" he and Nick, formed this band, invited these large personalities into it and created this incredibly egalitarian environment for their creative process.  To still be together (almost) and working that way to put out new albums is really incredible.  I hope they keep going and adding more chapters to the story.

B0058VW36U|4.0|This is a cute game but I tired of it rather quickly. Will probably enjoy playing it again after a few months.
0316228532|5.0|I am a person who will read a book and never re-read it.  I try to re-read books and even years later I will find it difficult to find something new, something I missed.  With Vacancy I could not stop thinking about it.  I could not read another book, I tend to read one after another, after another never being satisfied.  It has been a month since I finished Vacancy and after attempting to read 4 or 5 other books which I just could not get lost in I have begun re-reading Vacancy.  The characters in this book have been haunting me since I began reading it and I am finding it just as thrilling and exciting to re-read it.  This book is full of so very many people, deeply flawed, real people.  I have found something in common with each and every character, even the ones I didn't want to.  The book does not end well and nothing is settled but each and everyone of these characters has had their world flipped upside down and been forced to look more closely at their own lives, instead of trying to sustain themselves on the gossip of others in this small town. I have never read a book that left me so moved and full of so many different emotions all at once.  I don't think this book is for everyone but for those like me it will be an experience not soon forgotten.
B00288KNL8|5.0|My daughter wanted this and so I bought it for her. She was absolutely thrilled so glad that I did.
B000VLE3GA|5.0|These are all the Led Zepplin hits that I grew up with.  The first few songs do not sound as clear as I thought they would, but the whole package is very nice.  Now I don't have to look at the individual cd releases to find the song I want.
B005HSG3U6|3.0|#1 - I wouldn't advise the white one, very hard to keep clean. Adequate stand for reading or watching a video but not real stable for playing a game or typing. Product quality sufficient for the cost. All in all, I don't regret the purchase but I do hate the lining on the flap that folds over the screen. It's fuzzy like felt and picks up EVERY hair, crumb, and dust molecule within a 10' radius. I'm sure there is another textile they could use that would still be kind to the screen.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I play it on my moms ipad, it is so fun I play it all the time! I recommend it to adults and children (awesome family game.)
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|This game has been alot of fun to play. I did buy the upgrade so I have all the restaurants. The only complaint I have is sometimes it gets a little laggy. I enjoy time management games and the dash games have always been a favorite!
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Was not entertaining. Sexual with a bear. To creepy. Really was not a funny movie at all. From the trailers the show looked funny. Was  a big disappointment.
B005J4VV28|5.0|I am anxious to see the DVD, it was a Christmas gift and we have not viewed it yet. I was excited to find it.
B0041KVW2K|4.0|I'm probably an outlier among the people who got this box (it was a Christmas gift, but I asked for it).  First off, I'm not a raving Beatles fan - I like 'em and certainly acknowledge their massive influence on pop music, but for sixties rock I'll take the Who first and the Stones second, and over all I'm more into 70s punk and new wave than earlier music.  And unlike most Beatles fans, I much prefer the records before 1967 - I find the later music to often be pretentious and directionless and the lyrics better suited for children's nursery rhymes in way too many cases.  You can't seriously make \\"Yellow Submarine\\" or \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" into more than they are.<br /><br />Second, I'm didn't buy this expecting that vinyl was going to deliver an audiophile experience.  I'm an engineer who uses digital signal processing theory daily at work, and knowing the math behind it feel qualified to say that the idea that vinyl reproduces the original sound better than digital is sheer contrarianism.  Vinyl might sound different from digital, and some listeners might like the way vinyl alters the source sound, but a properly mastered CD reproduces the original source better than vinyl.  And it's the existence of 24 bit digital masters that will make it possible for people to hear the Beatles hundreds of years from now exactly as we do today when all early generation analog sources have moldered into slime and been carted off to the dump.<br /><br />And what is this rubbish with 180 gram vinyl?  I've got thousands of records that I bought in the 70s and 80s that were made with standard pressing techniques of the time, and most of them are more problem-free than any 180 gram record I've gotten in the past ten years, including these.  As far as I can tell, 180 gram vinyl just makes records cost more to make and ship, makes them take more space on my shelf, and makes them more likely to cut through the sleeve if someone mishandles them.  To me 180 gram vinyl is the equivalentof Monster cables - an appeal to psychology rather than true quality.<br /><br />So why did I want the vinyl if I feel this way?  Simply because I love the packaging of lps, and this set hits the bulls eye on this count, with really nice replicas of all the UK records including all the inserts and booklets that came with the originals.  The book has great pictures and does a decent job of telling the story of making all the records, although the narrative is a little too uncritical for my tastes.<br /><br />Almost nobody reviewing this box is talking much about the music - it's almost like people regard it as given that no one can critique the Beatles.  Certainly it's hard to do this fairly so long after the music was made.  But most people haven't heard everything the Beatles have done - there is sort of an \\"approved\\" list of Beatles classics that get airplay and the rest never do.  What I would hope people would appreciate in this set is the chance to hear the Beatles developing the classic \\"British Invasion\\" sound by merging 50s rock'n'roll and rockabilly with r'n'b and doo-wop, while also mixing in a touch of schmaltz-y Andy Williams-styled pop.  Covers of songs as varied as \\"Roll Over Beethoven\\", \\"You Really Got A Hold On Me\\", \\"Kansas City\\", \\"Honey Don't\\" or \\"Dizzy Miss Lizzy\\" just to name a few are real markers and show that rather than appearing out of the blue the Beatles actually represented something evolutionary in rock music.<br /><br />Although it's often acclaimed as the greatest lp of all time, \\"Sgt Pepper\\" is where the Beatles become an average band for me.  Take a song like \\"When I'm 64\\" - the sentiment is nice, but this is not a rock song, and it's not particularly creative - just because you lift a musical style from somewhere else and drop it in the middle of what is ostensibly a rock album doesn't mean you've done something inventive.  And going forward the Beatles do too much of this sort of thing, George Harrison's annoying flirtations with eastern music being another example.<br /><br />This is not to say the later records have no good tracks - there are many great ones.  But the records are uneven and the filler at times overwhelms the quality material.  On the white album, side 4 is almost unlistenable and klunkers like \\"Bungalow Bill\\" or \\"Rocky Raccoon\\" on the other sides make one wish they'd have exercised a little quality control and cut this down to a single disc.<br /><br />The box is modeled on the UK releases which the band meant to stand as lps as opposed to the hodge-podge collections that were released in the US.  But since there were many single sides that didn't appear on the UK albums, the box collects these up into a two lp set called \\"Past Masters\\".  Traversing the years from 1962 to 1970 in four sides is a little jarring, but most of the material on this set is top notch, with a blend of classic A sides and much less known but often equally brilliant flips - songs that are in many ways more compelling today than the well worn hits because their unfamiliarity makes them sound so fresh.<br /><br />Over the past week I digitized the whole box by playing it into SoundForge on my PC.  This gives me the opportunity to look at (and repair, when needed) the waveform for every song in the thing.  I was almost done with it and hadn't seen anything out of the unusual (at least by the standards of records of the past ten years, which are not that high compared to the late 70s and 80s) in the way of clicks and pops or other problems, so I was starting to wonder about all the irate complaining about sound quality in Amazon reviews.  But \\"Let It Be\\" finally showed me what the issues are - the first side of my copy is really horrible with almost continuous crackle throughout, way too much to fix with software.  Fortunately I had a decent 80s copy of this record already, so in my digitizing project I just substituted the old one.  But I agree with all the people who are complaining bitterly about thequality.  I'm in a quandary about shipping the set back - it seems more likely that I'll get a worse one in return.<br /><br />Lastly, I am not at all impressed with Amazon's packing, but I'm not surprised, either.  I've had them ship a thousand dollar SLR camera in a plain cardboard box with no padding at all, which amazingly survived.  In this case, despite the box weighing about 25 pounds, they just put it in an outer Amazon cardboard box with a single air-filled plastic bag on one side.  I think I was fortunate to have only a minor dent in one corner that affects about 5 of the lps - again something where I have to think about my chances of getting something worse if I return it.  I don't know how to wake Amazon to the fact that their shipping department needs a major upgrade.<br /><br />One last quibble - I have custom cabinets in my house designed to hold lps that are both tall enough and deep enough to hold every box set of records I've ever gotten - until now.  This thing is too deep for me to be able to close the cabinet doors, so I have to find some space in a bookcase somewhere to store it.<br /><br />Anyway, overall I really like the box - it meets what I was looking for in it.  I'm sympathetic to the people who experienced a lot of quality problems in the pressing, and it would be nice to see Capitol proactively do something about it.  But I won't hold my breath.
B0060FXBNM|5.0|This came on time, works and is just what i needed.  I couldn't ask for a better deal.  Great Value!

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It was really good. I Couldn't put it down<br />Really should be a must read. Loved the series all together.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie even though some friends said they didn't think it was all that good.<br />I love movies of this time peroid.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This book is action filled and is great how Riordan brought back Percy Jackson. The ending is a cliff hanger which makes you have to read the next in the series.
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|This movie is a must have if your into the Underworld thing.<br />To me this movie is tease for the next movie and it was over before I realized it.
B0090P98Z4|3.0|The game is okay, I played it for a day, graphics are okay and game controls are good, you do have to pay real money to move on.now I don't mind given the developers some money for there work but 100$ and 50$ come on.  You can spend less money on things but then you will get so far ,you will end up spending allot to move on,no thank you 100$ goes along way and is not going to this game.. I suggest playing to a point then finding a new game...
B003L20IHE|5.0|A young man loses his younger brother in A car crash,after that he claims he can see his ghost,at first it doesn't make any sense until near the end when he helps someone else from dying.This is A very heart warming film for the whole family should watch in A way it is also romanic.

B001QOGYFO|5.0|Simple story A uS marshall has to find how A man was killed while in the north pole while doing so she finds that the man and his friends found something in the snow and ice that could of led to murder.In my personal view it's an excellent murder mystery and with A pretty young female US Marshall it be something.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This is such a wonderful story that needs to be told. Adam Brown was a fearless man and a true patriot, while at the same time a spiritual man. I enjoyed this book so much and highly recommend it to all
B008JGSM6G|5.0|nice smooth game...easy at first...then gets gradually more challenging. I thought I had all the apps I needed. I was wrong! !'!  try it!!
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|And why do I like her music so much? Something about her voice, and the cadence of the music put together makes it more than the sum of the parts. I'm not a hip-hop fan. I don't like Lady Gaga and her ilk. But Lana Del Rey manages to make the songs addictive. The beat is non-stop; it's great for running on a treadmill! Or just walking along at a good clip. And the lyrics make me smile...
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I've played all of the Angry Birds games, and I enjoyed them all. That said, Angry Birds Star Wars is an absolute step up from the previous games. The birds are so much fun to play with since each one has a special mechanic. And it's free, so why not?
B004H4XDBI|5.0|This is an amazing ending to an amazing love story I just couldn't believe how Gayle could lead us to think that it would fall apart and then it didn't.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I'm quickly becoming addicted to this game. :-) The app has run smoothly and I haven't had any issues. Definitely worth the money.
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|Miss &#34;Minnie&#34; Pursling is living quietly, very quietly, in Leicester with her Grand-Aunts when she meets the young Duke of Clermont. Robert, the Duke, is in town to look over some factories that his father used to own. The late Duke of Clermont was a nasty man who used his title to get whatever he wanted. To combat that, Robert has learned to be the opposite of that, to the point where he is almost meek and unassuming. Someone has been distributing radical pamphlets inciting workers at the various factories to strike and suspicion is thrown on Minnie. Minnie has a very big secret to hide about her past and is terrified that someone will discover it by digging into the mystery of the creator of the pamphlets. She takes it into her own hands to find out what is going on.<br /><br />This was an unusual story for me in that 1) Robert is definitely a Beta Hero even though he is a Duke, and 2) Minnie's secret was... odd. The first point was evidenced throughout the book and especially during the first sex scene. The second point was revealed slowly and in pieces. Even when you think you know the whole secret, another part of it is revealed later. It's just so very unusual a secret. Usually, when a girl is &#34;ruined&#34;, I am pretty sure what it mostly entails. This one I could have never guessed. Also, after knowing the secret, I really questioned why the Great-Aunts did what they did. I also had a hard time figuring out Robert's mother. Did she hate Robert? Was she indifferent? Did she actually love him but didn't know how to show it?<br /><br />The story is very well written and the romance really shows itself in the last third of the book. There are some really great scenes such as one with Robert and Mrs. Marshall and many with Robert and Oliver, his brother. To get more of a background of Robert's and Oliver's background, I definitely recommend the prequel novella, The Governess Affair.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a nice ROMANCE. It was filled with the kind of romance and drama you'd expect. It was a nice, quick read.
B003KGBIRK|5.0|The best version of &#34;Videodrome&#34; to be released.  The DVD was nice, but this has a much sharper image. One of the best psychological horror movies ever.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I always have loved to play solitaire since I was a little girl. I love to challenge myself with the time and be quick. I get pretty good scores. It's awesome but watch out--cause time flies fast when you're having fun :)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved the book. I could not put it down. The characters are so different but belong so well together. Excited  to read the next book.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this game. Easy to follow, very addicting. I can learn all sorts of ways to play with these birds and is alot of fun.
B005LAIHPY|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised at how good this movie was. I wasn't expecting it to have anything more than explosions, a lame alien plot, and poor acting--but it actually was not really any of that.  It had great characters, good action, and some great/unique story lines.  Pleasantly surprised!
B006LSZECO|4.0|A page turner! Very realistic view of marriage and the way sick and twisted minds work. I enjoyed it very much.
B0059XTUVI|3.0|You can't blame Amazon for this one.  If I was Margaret Thatcher I'd sue the producers!<br /><br />Yes, it flashes back into her past but since the majority of the scenes have her talking to her dead husband, Denis, she comes across as someone that has &#34;lost it.&#34;<br /><br />There is very little recognition of Britain's first female prime minister, her trials, and accomplishments.
B004VD3YIM|1.0|App locks up my Kindle Fire every day. No other apps lock it up. I expect more out of an app that I paid for.
B00005N6KG|2.0|These headphones have lousy audio quality. There's almost no bass, they sound tinny, and they easily distort at higher volumes. They're good for spoken word, but not much else. And the cord just long enough to possibly fit my player into my pocket while these are on my head.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Easy and fun to play. Downloaded it for my granddaughters .So many different levels and lots of game options to choose from
B008QTVNUI|4.0|I am a little late to the Homeland phenomenon...just rented and watched Season 1 and found it to be similar in a lot of ways to &#34;24&#34;. Lots of layers and plot twists -- and I hear Season 2 is just as good.
B003TNQEF0|5.0|I have seen this twice. The ending is very thought provoking  and definitely unforgettable.  Great suspense with out being too too scary
B0093H8HXS|4.0|The Processor has been installed for around a month now and has been running great.  Solid upgrade from my old 3.0Ghz Athlon x2.  My only complaint is that the fan is noticeably loud.  I've checked the install multiple times and it seems to be set in there solidly.  But the entire thing is plastic which is probably part of the problem combined with the non screw in mounting.  I will probably get an aftermarket fan at some point.  Only reason this isn't 5 stars.  I miss my whisper quiet AMD fan.
B001DF68MA|5.0|it was easy to install.  My wife and i have a Kent Dual Drive Tandem Comfort Bike.  It was easy to install on it.  I'm 6' and I didn't have a problem pedaling.  I did have to bowleg a bit to pedal but just a bit.  Steering was no problem.  My son's 1st time riding a bike, he liked it, he was comfy and I had piece of mind since I could see him.  He enjoyed the view compared to back seats where he'll just stare at my back.  That was when he was 2.  Now that he's 3 1/2 I'm not sure if he'll fit in the seat but if he can fit, we'll go for a ride.  If not i may need to get a back seat.

B000SMWUPS|4.0|I use this for Uppababy G-luxe.  It works pretty well and doesn't need to be removed to be folded...so I thought.  I should've left it bit loser because one of the wire is poking out due to being pull in too tight when folded.  It still works.  I have losened it bit more but it swings bit more so I won't put something like hot coffee with opening in it since it'll spill.  Good to put water bottles, keys, sunglasses, food, etc.  I'd probably buy it again.

B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I like the game but only if you had unlimited time to where it's not a demo. Another thing when it was night I tried to build a house quickly but, I did not have enough supplies so I went to get some more. I got my stuff put back in my inventory and went to mine wood . I walk past an odd figure then it starts to chase me. It attacks me I attack it has no effect on it then I die and lose all my stuff! I come back alive again at the spot I was dropped off by the ship. ONCE again I AM ATTACKED BY FREAKING WOLVES! I come back and run for the water I try to swim around them but ugly wolf number 1 swims over I think great now I am totally dead . I am helpless as they kill me again .Has this happened to you ? Please share you story

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book talked more about life than almost anything I've read before.  It was deep without being confusing and overall a great read.
0375842209|5.0|This is a wonderful book. It is for 12 years old and up. It has a special way to tell you all about the horrible things that happened in Germany during seconds world war without getting into the horrible details and from a very special point off view. You can't stop thinking on that book for a months.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My husband gave me a new kindle fire for Christmas and this was the first book I read. I heard a lot of mixed reviews about<br />it and sought it myself.<br /> I love this book and I didn't want to stop reading. When everyone was soundlessly sleeping I was up trying to know what would happen to both of them. This is a must read book
B00006RIO7|5.0|Very nicely packaged.  No damage at all.  Very happy with the produce.  Thanks!Very nicely packaged.  No damage at all.  Very happy with the produce.  Thanks!
B00571F26Y|5.0|I absolutely recommend this book to every person in the world! This book makes you really think about what you are really eating everyday.

B009JBZH54|5.0|I am a BIG fan of Batman and the series. The packaging on this product was too nice to throw away.. Will watch these on a cold night while I'm on vacation.
0345457692|3.0|I've read a few of the other reviews but none of them mention the fact that considering this book is supposed to be set 500 years into the future, the technology certainly has not advanced much. People are still using keyboards, \\"flat screens\\", and ground cars. The author even refers to Mao and other 20th century phenomena as if it will still be relevant 500 years from now. That is not to mention the level of useless, trivial minutia that lends nothing to the story but fills pages and passes for \\"space opera\\" today.<br /><br />Even so, the book is not as bad as some of the unreadable garbage I have put down after reading a quarter of the book. Rama II is one of those - pure garbage. It is difficult enough to pick out the sci-fi from the fantasy in the book stores, and then you run into this. I give it a 3.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Love Gillian Flynn and have read all of her books. While this is not my favorite by this author, I read it during the London Olympics and couldn't put it down.

030758836X|3.0|A best seller to me is one that grabs me and I never want to end.  I thought the beginning was slow, I made myself keep reading it.  The middle was what I expected from a best seller.  The end was not good.  I actually thought perhaps I was missing pages.  I am really surprised this has moved up the best seller list.  I will get the authors other books at the library.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|My husband and I have been married for 42 years, so we could relate to some of the relationship issues.  Although we are not as far apart as this couple, we definitely enjoyed watching it.<br /><br />The acting was superb!  The movie is top notch and should be up for an academy award.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I'm sad that I'm finished. Truly enjoyed it and can't wait for the movie. I can't imagine it will be as good but looking forward to reliving the story.
1599218011|5.0|Love this book.  The title gave me a different impression of what to expect, in fact, I was slow to read it because of the title, but as I began to read it I loved it. It is full of interesting and motivating information to change one's eating habits.  Written in an entertaining style.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|I love the ability to access my files on the home pc so easily. as long as my wifi is a trusted connection, I can view photos, use programs that aren't compatible with my kindle (like iTunes or excel), and stream video as though I was right at the pc. I do not recommend using this type of program from a non secure connection, as it has minimal security (but faster connection/streaming time) Quality is good, so far no problems.<br /><br />Can't believe this is free!
B007HACDLK|5.0|It is very typical Vince Flynn.  Fast reading and fairly predictable, but one you can't put down until you finish.  I believe you either love these books or not.  They are books that could be written from real life in 2012.  Very similar story line of what should be told in the media but what is not.  Good vs. evil, isn't that what it all boils down to?
B0098VYKSA|3.0|I found this movie entertaining and I enjoyed the twists they put into the story we are all familiar with.  That said, I felt it started to drag about 2/3 of the way through and was ready for it to be over.  It's worth renting, but not something I would want to own.
1439153663|5.0|Free up your weekend because you will not be able to put this book down!  Awesome storyline and captures your attention page by page by page.

B005KLZWZC|5.0|This series is a fun read. It is full of unique adventures, at the same time engendering an interest in Greek and Roman mythology if readers want more background knowledge.

B001NLL0RW|4.0|The book was typical Rollins - and nobody does it like he does - good book.<br /><br />A problem.  For one, I was kinda on the side of Ivar - we do have an overpopulation problem - BIG time.  Rollins gives his explaining of this after the story is over, where he writes his notes.  If the Guild had not over-reacted as it did, they'd have succeeded with their seeds.  That's a flaw in the plot -  unless the Guild is incredibly stupid to scream \\"here I am, we are involved, see? see?\\"  If they had laid low, let the seeds just get planted and not made such a fuss - nobody would have been the wiser.  By the time anyone found out what was happening, it would have been too late - and finding a cure would have not been so easy.  Here, the Guild seriously messed up - or Rollins made them just too stupid to believe.  Marking their victims with the circle/cross was a serious flaw - it's the only thing that really called a connection to the first victims, when otherwise, the connection would have gone completely unnoticed.  Jason would have been thought to have been killed in the riot - and the professor could have been killed in some staged car accident or whatever.  The mark they branded on the foreheads alerted Sigma.  Can the Guild possibly be that stupid?<br /><br />A factual flaw.  DNA shows that e.g. Akhenaton and his son Tut have Iberian (which is Celtic) DNA.  They were far far from being blacks.  Afrocenticism is a mythological view of history, totally so.  Egyptians weren't black.  Nubeans were. It's been widely known in some circles that there was a connection between Egypt and the Celts - eg, Anymm (spelling) IS Anubis.  Bagpipes.  Amber. things like that.  Now, the DNA sample from the mummies.
0670024813|3.0|Jared Diamond is quite famous for his well-argued \\"geographical hypothesis\\" for helping to explain global (continental) inequality ([[ASIN:0393061310 Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies]]).  This can be contrasted with the \\"cultural hypothesis\\" which relies more heavily on the role culture plays in explaining the social evolution and dissemination of technology ([[ASIN:0140439218 The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism: and Other Writings (Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics)]]).  These positions are not necessarily mutually exclusive, but can be complementary.  Indeed Diamond has argued for long-term periods and concerning \\"continental\\" trends the \\"geographical hypothesis\\" is more important, while for short-term periods and sub-continental or regional trends the \\"cultural hypothesis\\" takes precedence.<br /><br />Thus, according to Diamond if Historian's fail to explain the broadest patterns and exclusively focuses on cultural aspects, there is a large moral gap in our understanding of human society and social being.  Likewise if there is an over focus on geography and technology, then there is a large moral gap in our anthropological understanding of day-to-day existence.<br /><br />In \\"The World Until Yesterday\\" Diamond attempts a greater synthesis than he has in his previous two books.<br /><br />This book will be a very interesting antidote toward Ian Morris's ([[ASIN:0691155682 The Measure of Civilization: How Social Development Decides the Fate of Nations]]) to be released in January 2013.  I have also read an advanced copy of Morris's book, very little new in his book from his ([[ASIN:0312611692 Why the West Rules--for Now: The Patterns of History, and What They Reveal About the Future]]).  In Diamond's new book there is much new material, not necessarily in full agreement with his \\"geographical hypothesis.\\"<br /><br />In this new book \\"The World Until Yesterday\\" the focus is on so-called tribal societies.  Clearly, much more than inhis recent work his focus is honed in on cultural factors.  Diamond believes traditional societies have much to offer civil societies of modernity.  Cultures of tribal society are capable of enriching our culture and lives today.<br /><br />Diamond maintains the watershed moment is the rise of state government and systems of law and courts.<br /><br />In tribal society a dispute would have to be solved face-to-face between members.  Diamond does not argue the face-to-face interaction is necessarily better than legal court systems for resolving disputes, but to point out the difference are important and certain advantages do exists for tribal organization.<br /><br />Likewise Diamond is interested in how individuals in tribal society bring up their children, how elderly are cared-for, the role of religion, health, how we deal of danger and treats, etc.  Again Diamond emphasizes there are strong differences between tribal and modern societies, some good some bad.<br /><br />Diamond is famous for his Pulitzer Prize-winning book \\"Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies.\\"  In it he develops and defends a version of environmental determinism, attempting to explain why Europeans were able to conquer and colonize other nations around the world.  His thesis argued Europe had an environmental advantage of plentiful plants and animals.  The environmental advantage was the basis of disease immunity, greater health, etc, stimulating technological innovation and political organization and offering tremendous economic advantage.<br /><br />The `negation' of \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" is taken up in his next book \\"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed\\" ([[ASIN:0143117009 Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed: Revised Edition]]).  The thesis in \\"Collapse\\" is how environmental misfortunes and catastrophes help to explain the extinction of cultures and civilizations.<br /><br />\\"The World Until Yesterday\\" makes Diamond's three books a true trilogy.  Here he is arguing that societies of the past don't only collapse, but offer us insights into how to organize our own civilization  to avoid collapse and extinction ourselves.  For example he argues multilingualism has benefits.  That certain dietary practices (e.g. too much salt and sugar) are bad for the individual, but also for the survival of civilization.<br /><br />As alluded above, Diamond is also interested in how treating our elderly and our infants and toddlers, young children more generally contribute to survival or collapse of civilization.  Thus, bad parenting is not merely an individual event, but has consequences for civilization itself.  Diamond also analyzes institutions of religion and their function in the successful reproduction of society.<br /><br />As in his previous books, Diamond is impressive in his synthesis of anthropology, evolutionary biology, sociology, human nutrition and physiology, economics, and linguistics.  This is arguably the best book of the three.  Although Diamond is rather elusive with conclusions, normative pronouncements are abundant.  He clearly finds great merit in \\"traditional\\" practices of previous and current societies.  At the same time his environmental/technology determinism shine through to remind us \\"progress\\" happens for a reason.  Thus, his normative pronouncement are rather circumvented to suggest traditional practices may be able to reduce warfare, take better care of children and youth, and provide better care and empathy for the elderly and downtrodden.<br /><br />Diamond is always a fascinating and fun read.  This book seems less of the environmental/technology determinism of his \\"geographical hypothesis\\" as argued strongly in his previous work.<br /><br />It provides much more room for culture.  This is important, it is a major contribution to post-formalist anthropology.  Five stars for what Diamond writes and develops.  Two stars for what he fails to develop.  What we can see from studying anthropologyis limited.  Diamond is groping to bring in culture, but in a far too limiting way.  It is remarkably disappointing to discovery that what we have to learn from traditional societies (the very subtitle of the book) is to take better care of our children and elderly, to practice better nutrition, and to be kinder to one another.  David Graeber's anthropology ([[ASIN:B007736MM8 Debt]]) is far more relevant to contemporary society, specifically written to understand power-relations and hegemonic movement of one culture to another.  From Graeber we learn how power, debt and money have been used to conquer and control.  From Diamond we learn how people should eat more nutritiously and be kinder to one another.  Graeber, for me, is far more important and relevant for understanding contemporary society.

B009G7ZYPY|4.0|I Liked it but it wasn't quite what I expected. Her version wasn't quite what I had hoped for. But I would buy again.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I borrowed book one from neighbor.  Wasn't sure if I wanted to keep reading or not because book one was pretty kinky.  But I decided to go ahead and see what happens.  Was glad I did, it explained alot and you really get into the characters.  Moving on to book three now.

B000WGZGNS|4.0|Product was listed \\"Like New\\" and do not mention that the case had damage done to it. But still great movie and love it.
B0083ZBW2Y|2.0|Although good, this book was very monotone for me. I think that they threw away life too easily, when life is such an amazing thing. You only get one! I also think that Buck is a very flat and static character. The only change made in him is a negative change. He becomes savage and cruel. He also doesn't seem to have any faults, making him more of a \\"super dog\\" than a realistic character. He is big, strong, the best fighter the there is, kills people, dominates the land, kills all other predators around (including single handedly killing a bear, which in reality takes upwards to above 6 or 7 wolves to take down) and becomes more wolf-like. But what are the contrasting traits? There really are none that I can see, making him very unbelievable as a character.<br />Also, I thought that it was very unclear about  the other characters (mainly the other sled dogs). Their personality descriptions were mentioned only once or twice, if at all, and you never really got a clear picture of what they looked like and who they were as a character. I think that they should've been described more fully, as well as with Buck,who we only find out what he looks like in the last couple of pages, when really he should have been described from the get go.

B00447L4JG|5.0|My daughter is such a fan of this movie, and so I had to buy this for her.  It is a really well-made film and I think anyone would enjoy it.
1936608618|2.0|I am a runner from the so called \\"LSD\\" model. I decided to buy and read the book because I wanted to see what Crossfit endurance was about and at least try to understand from their point of view.<br /><br />My biggest criticism of the book is the lack of understanding of the Lydiard model.<br /><br />1. Lydiard DOES NOT advocate for every single runner to run 100 mile weeks. If the author actually read what Lydiard said in his books or from the Lydiard foundation, one would see that Lydiard advocated for runners to run by minutes. Not every single Lydiard athlete was running the 100 mile weeks. For example, Peter Snell was doing 70-80 miles a week for most of his career and only did 10 weeks of 100 miles a week ONCE and that was before the Tokyo games. Lydiard based mileage on each runners individual needs. If a runner could only handle 40 mile weeks, he would have them do 40 mile weeks. If someone could handle 150-200 mile weeks, he would let them run the mileage.<br /><br />2. If the author did read anything about Lydiard, he would discover that Lydiard advocated for Long STEADY distance runs. Snell and other runners were easily running 6 minute pace on most of their runs.... If the author wants to call that \\"slow\\" then so be it. The coach who really advocated for Long Slow distance was Ernest Van Aken, a German coach.<br /><br />3. I have an issue with the fact that author states that all runners do 80 percent LSD and 20 percent intensity and no real \\"form work.\\" Lydiard worked on form.... A pretty successful coach by the name of Peter Coe (Sebastian Coe's coach and Father) worked a lot on form (the author probably could have seen that if he ever read any of Coes books). Also, if he read Lydiard's first book, run to the top, he would see that in the anaerobic phase his athletes were running interval work 6 days A WEEK. Peter Coe had his runners doing in some case 4-5 times a week. Joe Newton, the legendary running coach at York high school, has his runners run intervals 4-5 days a week... Thats alot more than just \\"20%\\". Runners (who have good coaches), do not just run easy during the base phase. Look at well coached athletes (from masters runners to Elite runners to high school runners) are doing all out hill sprints, threshold runs, fartleks, cruise intervals, strides, goal pace/date pace work. Also if the author read anything on Peter Coe to John Cook to really any elite coach, he would see that they advocate for a LOT of ancillary workouts, general strenght workouts, and weight lifting.<br /><br />I feel like the author generalize all runners who do mileage to be \\"LSD\\", when that's really not the truth. Are there some runners who do just Long Slow distance? Yes. Do I agree with the author that these runners should include more intensity, weight lifting, and form work? YES. But don't generalize every single \\"LSD\\" model runners as mileage obsessed.<br /><br />Now I could have given this one star but I do feel like the strength and conditioning chapters, hydration, and mobility chapters worth the price of the book. Very well done and worth the price of the book.
0679805273|5.0|I bought this as the classic graduation gift for my daughter.  She loved it, and has been a Seuss fan since Kindergarten.  Great gift.
B004UID2LC|2.0|its ok at first but then the videos you download stop working and it gets REALLY annoying. not very good don't get it
B0034G4P80|5.0|A must-have for the Thor fan.  I bought this as a gift for a Thor fan, and they absolutely love it  This might be the gift for that Thor fan that you are looking for.
030759565X|5.0|If you're unfamiliar with The Smitten Kitchen, you cannot go wrong with this book. Recipes will use mostly basic ingredients you already have, or could easily get from your regular grocer. No fancy kitchen tools or gadgets required. And though Deb herself is very witty and charming, the recipes are straight forward and can be understood by any level of cooking experience. I can't wait for the *fingers crossed* 2nd edition!!
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|T his was a gift for someone, and they loved it as this is just what they had wanted.  It is a different kind of story, but young people seem to like it.
B0012CH350|5.0|I bought this cover a year ago to protect a Weber Smokey Mountain Cooker. It fits great, is easy to slide on and off the cooker, and still looks new. It’s a good cover.

B00A9C3RB8|3.0|The movie was good except it dragged on a bit in the middle.  I especially loved the ending.  Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones are great.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very well written. A beautiful story of love and second chances with a touch of thrill and adventure. This deserves five stars!
B001UAX56A|5.0|When this came out my parents had this, my cousin and people I went to school with, so many years later now I have it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was so amazing I will be getting the other one soon. Mr. Grey well words can't even express this man. He's one of a kind and so well put together. That's a respectable way of putting it
B005OUARUO|3.0|About Me;<br />I listen to mostly indie rap/hip hop and little of R&B, I'm picky with music that's why I don't listen to radio or watch music video on music video channels any more, they play the same crap for months. If I'm going to listen to something outside what I truely like and love it has to be unique and different from the norm, also their single has to be strong enough to make me want to check them out. I will then preview their album on Amazon preview window (though I wish it was a 45 sec to a minute of each track for better assessment) and I'll make judgement to buy it or not.<br /><br />Now the Album;<br />I heard and saw Feist song 1,2,3,4 song back when it showed on Vh1, then eventually downloaded a few tracks from her first album for my mix cd, fastforward to this year where I wonder did she ever came out with a second album which I found out she did. I'd watched her music video &#34;The bad in eachother&#34; on youtube, and her other single &#34;bittersweet melodies.&#34; I decided to buy the album instead of  illegal downloading, so after nearly 2 weeks of listening to it I'll give it a 3.5. My reason is this; I don't know her background but she sound southern and as much as I like certain songs I still can't figure out everything she's saying, I need to look up her lyrics for each songs. I know it might make me sound dumb but I am confuse about every tracks but some do sound very good but like I said i'm confuse of what she is saying in these songs. That's why I gave it a 3.5, now a list of the stand out tracks;<br />The bad in eachother<br />The circle married the line<br />Comfort me<br />Graveyard<br />Anti-Pioneer<br />Undiscovered First.
B004AQR29C|3.0|Any new Stallone movie where he plays a mercenary is going to be a bit silly.  Add Dolph Lundgren and it gets ridiculous.  Exactly what you need to waste time on an airplane.  I will be watching &#34;The Expendables II&#34;
B0027Z837S|3.0|This is a GREAT movie, however it is subtitled. There is no mention of subtitles on the rental site. There is an English language version. I assumed that was the one I was renting (shame on me). As I said, there is no mention of subtitles on the rental site (shame on Amazon). LET THE VIEWER BEWARE.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I use this app constantly.  Set up on my Kindle Fire and I have it set to pop up temperature, current conditions, etc.  Love the clock and all of the &#34;stuff&#34; it has.  Worth a couple of bucks for sure.  Much better than any of the free weather apps I have.
B005JR47R6|5.0|I love this show. Season eight was great and any House fan must see this season! Great buy for a gift!
B008K8VDPU|1.0|Don't bother taking the time to download this one.  There's nothing here.  Oh sure.  It works.  But if that's important, just go to the toy store and pick up a real kid's piano.  You'll be much happier...
B009FOBZL0|5.0|LOVE the Wallflowers. I have been a fan since the early nineties and this album really shows the growth the band has made over the years.

B007SGM084|5.0|I enjoyed every word of this trilogy and cannot wait to read it again. Very informative, stimulating at times and very coy. Very good read. Would recommend to anyone of appropriate age to read and indulge in this book!
B0091REZMW|5.0|This is a pretty cool game so far! I'm still learning the ropes of it tho, I haven't understood some things fully like the alien stuff, and how to charge my collections yet, is still a work in progress!!!
B004TI5N38|5.0|I really like the new character and the book was well written. It was one of those that you are sorry to see it come to an end. I have seen other reviews that don't rate it well and all I can say is maybe they are reading the wrong books to begin with. If you don't enjoy this type of story than why even start reading it? I think it will be a great series and will compete right up there with Reacher fans.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Nothing I say or write will give this book any justice, the meaning and story is absolutely perfect in the most broken and imperfect way. If you don't laugh so hard and cry the next second, you don't deserve the eyes you have to read, might as well give them to Isaac.
0385040253|5.0|I wanted to learn how to tie up my girl firend, but this book don't have knots like that? What else do guys at sea do?
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Great book! Keeps you guessing until the very end, a little predictable though. But overall a great read for adults.

B00ADYYBFI|5.0|Love the show and love the music. It was great to be able to get some of the music from the show.
B000N2HCM4|5.0|After all of the misinformation regarding President Obama's birthplace and background, it was refreshing to read the facts and learn how his character was formed.  Excellent read for both Obama supporters and non-supporters alike.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|I never would have &#34;picked&#34; this movie,  if a friend of mine hadn't sugguested it.  It's a good story (some adult language and situations,  so it's NOT for children).  Delves into coming of age and relationships .... Highly recommend.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Good pocket size in this little sharpener. It has all you need to sharpen most knives, including a tool for serrated blades. I like the ease of use and the size. It is a good companion to put in a fishing box or pocket or to take on a camping trip. Works well and the price is very reasonable.
B0054SMID0|4.0|I think Mr. McConaughey has found his calling... play a lawyer and you'll always be golden. This movie, already based on a book, had a great story to start with and the actors did a good job of pushing the story along. The surprise twists were enjoyable and didn't make this just another ho-hum law drama. Marisa Tomei is excellent, I think she's gotten better with age. The rest of the supporting case is great; even had a chuckle at Trace Adkins as a biker... who knew?!
B00AEFVRB2|3.0|This movie was just &#34;alright.&#34; The acting was just &#34;alright.&#34; It was weak in many areas, and M. McConaughey showed he can play a mean, sick villian, but other than that I felt the movie was not very well done. Not sure what Mathew thought it would be (besides a good paycheck) but it went very quickly to DVD/rental, for good reason.
B002SAS26E|5.0|This game is well-put together, attractive, easy to learn, and fast--a game plays in about 20 minutes or less for us.  I just gifted a copy of it to my brother and his mostly- non-gaming girlfriend.  I can find almost nothing unlikeable about Jaipur!
B004XWLIJS|4.0|The special effects were better than the origional, but there were some slow spots. Good action movie over all and I enjoyed it for an afternoon of fun.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|You can read this from end to end, but it's not really best used that way. Take a good quick read and then use it as a reference to get you excited about learning something new and trying new cooking techniques. I only got the Kindle edition and while it's good I'm pretty sure it loses a lot of the beauty in the pictures when compared to the hardcover version, still worth it though.
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|As a child of the 80s I grew up watching Arnold's action movies and was a big fan.  That having been said, I was excited to see the remake, to see the updated special effects and to see Jessica Beale and Kate Beckensale.  I would say it was an okay action movie on it's own but did not stand up well as a remake.  They deviated from the original story line so much I think they would have been better off giving it a different name.  All in all worth renting but not buying.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I like it, it keeps the kids busy. Not the best game, it frustrates the kids, they get tired of repeating the same level
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Cinematography and 3D effects were great for me. The story line seemed to not reach a stall point in the escalation of the story line. I just could not walk away once I got the movie started. Great watch for a real Batman fan...

B002ZHKZEM|5.0|A little \\"dark\\" as far as the new Doctor Who series goes, and in every set of shows there are bound to be a few that don't quite hit the mark. My least favorite was \\"Planet Of The Dead\\". I just couldn't warm to Lady Christina as a companion nor as a character... a smarmy smart@rse I can do without, much the same as Catherine Tate who totally ruined series 4 with her obnoxious Donna Noble character. Tate appears in the final 2-parter here and, although I was put off by her and her annoying grandfather, the delicious eccentricity of John Simm as The Master, the menace of Timothy Dalton as #1 Time Lord and the wonderful David Tennant as The Doctor more than made up for the belligerent squawking of Donna Noble. \\"Waters Of Mars\\" by far the superior story here... but all episodes have their points of interest and there is seldom a dull moment.<br /><br />Lots of extras and commentaries... plus it all looks super on Blu-Ray.
B003AJKPL2|5.0|This cherry pitter is great!  I have used it with both cherries and olives.  It worked especially well on the sour cherries, which are very delicate.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I love the awesome pictures used for these puzzles.  I can sit and work beautiful puzzles all day, every day.  I love this app.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was mesmerized from the first chapter and the first book.  It often made me think of our current life and made me realize how precious it is and and if we aren't careful, Panem could exist.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Very fun and entertaining especially for a free app.  I am sure I will enjoy it for many, many hours.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is really fun.<br />it gives you points so you can get other ones.<br />i love it cause its fun.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was a great love story.  It was a book that I couldn't put down, would look up and realize it was dark outside.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|It was definitely not what we expected, but my husband & I couldn't stop laughing.... Silly, but funny as hell!
B001O7WLZ0|4.0|\\"No drum machine on this one,\\" Phil announces in the liner notes, as if that's something to be excited about. For those who scoffed at the thought of an acclaimed drummer using computerized drums for much of his music, it may be, but I generally prefer drum machines over live drums, if only because they don't succumb to human imperfection.<br /><br />But percussion is a side note here. The obvious change is the sound of the songs themselves. Upbeat world music sways rhythmically in bright contrast to the dark melodic tones of the previous album, Both Sides, arguably his best solo set so far. This new one doesn't even come close. But there are plenty of good songs to be found.<br /><br />There's a delightful fan dedication entitled Wear My Hat, which, thanks to its Mbaqanga-inspired polyrhythms, will be compared to Paul Simon's Graceland. It's In Your Eyes captures the sweet sound of 1960s romance while a remake of Bob Dylan's Times Are A-Changin shows that both remakes and bagpipes can work well thing if done right.<br /><br />marcellee.com
B005XN31LY|5.0|It's been so long since there has actually been a show that my Husband & I sit together to watch. When the end of the show comes to a close for the night we look at each other and say: OMG! I can't wait until next week to see what happens. Great show! I had to purchase the first season so we have it to watch over & over again. I can't wait until All of season 2 is available for purchasing....  Love it Love it Love it!!!!
0345803493|5.0|It was very hard to put the  book down.  I loved the characters.  The writing was very interesting, but, I loved it.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|A ridiculous movie. A waste of time and money. I quit watching halfway through. I've seen a lot of great and smart comedies. This wasn't one of them.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Great movie!  I look forward to watching it again.  Great storyline and message for children of all ages...be careful of what you wish for, you might get it.  Also, girls need to talent, smart, strong and brave, so they can have a say in who their life partner may be.  I will be watching it again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the second time I've read this book and I love it even more. There is so much action jammed in this book interlaced with romance that it's good for a wide range audience.you will be impressed Katniss  and fall in love with Peeta
0345803485|5.0|I tried  not to read the book for the longest of time.  After I started, I could put it down.  Reading during my lunchbreak.  Whenever I had a half an hour to myself; and before bed.  I need me a Christian Grey in my life!!
0316017930|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book a lot. It has so many questions to make you think about in this life. And guess what, the answers are in there, and I guarantee you that all the theories sound very reasonable. They might not be 100% correct, but his theories cannot be neglected.
0345803507|5.0|I loved this trilogy! I am  glad it ended the way it did.  I want the movie to come out very soon!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|anyone who has been faced with death will understand the need to read this book. an eye opener for those sho dont appreciate everyday
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|This was right up there with Aliens, one of my favorite movies.  I kinda wondered if it was a forerunner of Alien.  I did hate that there was no explanation of the aliens.  I was glad the female survived!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Who can live without this? I sure couldn't. I am really happy to have this  app. on my Kindle Fire.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|I like this game just wish my life's were never ending but of course for a price they could be I have the free app but love an appreciate that version
B0063GORYU|5.0|This s a great game. It is challenging especially if you use a few suits. It is so much fun.
B00APUQH0W|3.0|Not sure how pretty decent acting only ends up with a so/so rating, but they managed to with a weak story.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game it is so much fun. I love this game. It can be challenging. You should try it.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This is the worst novel I have ever read -- and, I really don't know why I gave it more than my usual 100 pages. The plot of a dysfunctional marriage entered into by two nut jobs is highly improbable and simply not credible. I have given only one star for this review but I do not believe it deserves any!
0979019753|5.0|I purchased this journal not sure of what really to expect, but when I received it and went through it I thought wow this is awesome. In the past I have purchased journals that had nice pages however,they were blank pages. What I love about this journal is it starts with step by step ideas and instructions on how to better your day to day life, and every week it has a space where it reminds you to set your goals (checklist is another great asset) and the daily inspiring thought has helped me get started with a positive, great journal that transcends through out the day. This has definitely taken my idea of keeping a journal to the next level.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|The alarm clock is great! Nice big, bright numbers! And wake you up alarms! Or use your own music! Its awesome!!!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book is an intriguing book and even though it is a bit slow, it is a very good book and I loved it
0307341577|5.0|this amazing book could have easily been titled \\"the darkest freaking places you could never even have imagined.\\" and i mean that as an absolute compliment. the story is incredibly deep and very intense. i won't give away anything away but will simply say i am an avid reader and i have never experienced a twist late in the tale like dark places-i actually cried it was so heartbreaking. flynn has such a gift for creating these damaged, flawed characters that come completely to life. i would recommend to anyone who can appreciate a dark and twisty story that will leave you haunted.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|It was a pretty good book. Would recommend to anyone who likes a good romance book. Only its Pretty predictable though.
B000JQU1VS|4.0|I think this is a really good book but they should translate the money amounts so that they are understandable
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome and the movie follows well. It's nice to read books with strong female characters and I can't wait to read the next 2
B003YUF0GC|3.0|Early to tell but working good at the moment, any given product should not be reviewed right away.  What would be the point, ya worked the day I bought it and so it sould, Showed up as promissed again and so it should.  Ask me 3 years from now.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This book was great. This is better than driving to the library or go to the store and spend money on a dictionary. And you Don't have to leave the comfort of your home. But it took me 1 whole day to read it all. The reason I Don't like this because. It just takes to long to read.
B005IQZB14|5.0|What a gutsy lady.  Her walk was something that most women would never take especially my herself.  The people she met and the descriptions of encounters with wildlife were fun to read about.  Wow!
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Black comedy suits Johnny Depp well, and this is definitely black, due mainly to the rather bloody sections.  It's got some things in common with the original Dark Shadows soap opera, but that's all.  It was a fun escapist watch.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|He is a terrific writer.  I enjoyed this story very much.  His characters are believeable and you want to know what happens to them.  Very interesting read.
B0083GQVOC|2.0|This is an overly complicated telling of a simple story. Visually, it was compeling but, I knew what was going on and predicted the outcome. Tilda Swinton is appropriately pained as the mother. John C. Reilly is appropriately clueless as the father.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|This is a very interesting read.  A little confusing with the different time periods but David Mitchell did a good job<br />connecting the stories.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|This overall was a good movie, but with all its updated graphics and modern twists, it still wasn't as good as the original.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its Like Temple Run but soooo much better! This is an amazing game. I love it sooo much. Just try it! Ill give you 5 reasons.<br /><br />1.) If you dont like it, you can always delet it.<br />2.) It doesnt even cost $!<br />3.) You never know if yiu like it unless you try it!<br />4.) I might have shown you the best game ever!<br />5.) Ya like temple run right? Well this is the new and improved modern version of it.
B0083SBM7Q|5.0|All the money invested, all the preparations and set up finally came to a head with the release of the Avengers. I saw it the day it came out and was not disappointed.<br /><br />Flawless, no. The opening twenty minutes is slow, not because there's no action, but because it's very standard fare. The real movie starts when the heroes begin to appear: Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, and the Hulk. That's when it really is a comic book come to life, without apology or ironic detachment. It's really the opposite of &#34;The Dark Knight&#34;: though both are excellent films, &#34;The Avengers&#34; is hopeful and bright where the former is gritty and bleak.<br /><br />Anyway, loved it, watched it twice, and I would love to see it in the theater a few more times.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was great and kept you tuned into the story. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves adventure.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|It's its own film, separate from the original.  It's sci-fi, fun, and if you like that kind of thing you will like this. I don't know why it got lower reviews.  It is what it is, and it's fun.  Enjoy it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Great story and believable characters make this a worth while experience. Would definitely recommend this book to people who like thriller based stories.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|GOOD CHOICE FOR ALL AGES, MEN, WOMEN & CHILDREN TOO. LOTS OF ACTION, AND OF COURSE ITS THE COMPLETION OF THE DARK KNIGHT SAGA. CHRISTIAN BALE MAKES AN AWESOME BATMAN, & I LIKE THE WAY THE CHARACTERS ROBIN & CATWOMAN ARE DEPICTED THROUGHOUT THE MOVIE. LOTS OF FUN FOR ALL!
0451169514|4.0|IT is a classic horror, that leads the reader  and exemplifies  all the aspects of a horror novel. I used an excerpt for a final exam on horror genre.
1416987118|5.0|It's an old story, a familiar chant. But here it is wonderfully illustrated, too! Our family lexicon is richer now with the addition of &#34;squelch-squerch.&#34;
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Love the game. Lot  of games. It's awesome. It is cool. . It is nice lob  it very very cool really is
B006PTL1QM|5.0|I highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in psychology. This movie provided some insight into Jung's life that I had not previously been aware of.
B00A3AUGEW|4.0|I really liked Phillip on American Idol, and was excited for the album. Overall, the songs are good and the album flows nicely.
B0030B1WBM|4.0|This is one of the movies our family simply *has* to see each Christmas season. It makes us laugh every time. It pays homage to the 30-minute cartoon version, but it's highly creative and very entertaining. This movie is Jim Carrey at his best. So I was delighted to see it available on Amazon's streaming movie list.<br /><br />But the version Amazon shows is truncated from the TV version I've seen before. Where is the Who house decoration contest? That's one of the funniest parts! And where's the Who gift exchange? Why the cuts? I'm sad Amazon only offers this stripped-down version, otherwise I'd give it 5 stars.
B000002A46|5.0|This is one of my favorite Christmas albums - I lost my old copy, so bought this as a replacement. So many classic Christmas songs, this is a must in December.
B009CCBCU4|4.0|this book did hold my attention and I will go back and look at the rest of the series.  My only complaint with this is that the map just cannot be brought up large enough to read in an Android kindle app.
B005WTR4ZI|2.0|Luckily, authors said it is a book about technology. not economics, because in my view, the world will experience a severe labour shortage, never experienced before.<br /><br />However, two stars because it is well written and informative.<br /><br />Recurrently, every twenty years, somebody comes up with a science fiction thesis, whereas scientific publications show how overrated has always been artificial intelligence.<br /><br />It is also a matter of taste, indeed.
B0060AY6FO|2.0|To those who are Jane Austen fans, I'm sure this was a fascinating read.  For those of us who like a well written, interesting, compelling piece of fiction, a tad on the snooze side, I'm sorry to report.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Really liked all the Hunger Game books.  Felt it was well written, held me interested through  the book ,didn' want it to end.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I grab my Kindle every time I pay my bills. This app makes that job go so much faster. It is easy to read, shows the last action, and has everything I need in a calculator.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mockingjay - All the emotions you have been saving up for the final battle will be unleashed in the excellent ending to the Hunger Game trilogy! President Snow is evil, or is he? Katness makes some difficult decisions. Tragedy is in full force that will leave you screaming, or crying, or both. Questions are answered and the story does indeed end. The roller coaster of intrigue and emotion of this wonderful series does indeed come to an end.... and holy hell, what a wonderful ride it was!!<br /><br />  Normally my reviews are full of spoilers. This time however, I did my best to leave as much out as possible. I didn't want to ruin a thing! It is rare that I give anything 5 stars (whether I write the review or rate it in my head). The Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins is by far one of the best series I have read in 2012! I can not recommend it high enough! If you like action, emotion, love triangles, dystopia, excellent character development, and excellent story telling ... then this is YOUR story! Stop reading my review and go read the book already! I promise you, it will not disappoint!<br /><br />~*~ Rhea
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Even if you can't draw you have fun with this game. It is easy to understand and even children can enjoy this one!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire- just when you think President Snow couldn't be more creepy, he tops himself! He is E-V-I-L and you will love to hate him! His anger at Katness shows full force as he plots his way to punishment! Katness remains \\"torn between two lovers\\". As with most middle books there is a lot of set up for the final book, however, I find that Suzanne Collins did a great job at filling us in on a lot of back story as well. I would have liked to have gotten to know Gale a bit better but I wasn't disappointed either. There are a multitude of new characters in this book that will absolutely melt your heart. I for one will not be able to look at walnuts again without wanting to roast them on an electric fence. The action, the twisted plot, and the struggles in this book, like the first book, will keep your eyes glued to the pages.<br /><br />  Normally my reviews are full of spoilers.

B004EPYZP8|4.0|Fun movie to watch.  Enjoyed the story line and the actors in it.  The twists and turns are intriguing, but I have to admit I loved the book even more!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have read many of the reviews on the Hunger Games series. I agree with many and not so much with others ... but that's the great thing about book discussions. Gaining different perspective from others can often make us open our minds to things in ways we never thought of. One reviewer wrote that Hunger Games is not a new idea but rather just a retelling of Battle Royal. Well, I have a theory on this, and I will keep it simple. As a musician, we often hear \\"there are no more original ideas, it's how you play the music\\". I think the same can be said for almost any book as well. It is all in the way you tell the story ...<br /><br />  Hunger Games, WOW! Could there be a more mind-blowing concept for a story! I found myself torn between what Suzanne Collins was trying to take a jab at (in a good way). Was she poking at society? Was she poking at the media? Was she poking about classes and segregation? Was she making a point about bad fashion? Was she making a point of it all? Absolutely brilliant writing ... I don't care what anyone else says! I was engulfed in the story from the first chapter of book one and could not put it down. I read all three books in one week. AH-MAZE-ING story telling! Thank you Suzanne!!<br /><br />  Could there be a more deliciously brutal and screwed up world? The facts are simple, and so so so awfully intriguing! To sum it up ... greed destroyed the world, to survive they divided it into 13 poverty stricken districts to which each provide a resource that is delivered to the rich and glutenous Capitol, District 13 fights back and is squashed by the Capitol, as punishment each district must give up one boy and one girl between ages 12 and 18 to fight to the death as a reminder to know their place in society .... and the whole thing is televised ENTERTAINMENT for the Capitol. And that is just the tip of this very complex iceberg. The further you dig the more substance you find. Suzanne Collins is an EXCELLENT story teller.<br /><br />Hunger Games - as mentioned above, is an excellently twisted tale with adventure, love triangle, intrigue and deception. The characters will suck you in and make you love them! The love triangle will keep you guessing (and hoping)! The action will keep you on the edge of your seat! The atrocity will piss you off! Rue will make you bawl your eyes out! And I can promise you that when the ending rolls around you will absolutely rush out to get that second book!!<br /><br />**One thing I want to strongly advise here! If you saw the movie, do yourself a favor and READ THE BOOK!! Suzanne Collins had to cry with the final cut of the movie. While I think the actors did a wonderful job, the director did not do a good job of telling the story ... he missed the entire point and feel of the books completely! Please, read the books! The movie does not do them justice.**<br /><br />  Normally my reviews are full of spoilers. This time however, I did my best to leave as much out as possible. I didn't want to ruin a thing!

B007P7UF0G|5.0|Richard Harris was the best King Arthur ever!  I have loved this movie ever since it was first released!  Richard Harris was the finest actor ever!  He made this movie the success it was.  I love watching it over and over!
1451695187|5.0|Great Book<br />I've always had faith in an after life and Karma, reincarnation etc.  The poem at the end is a heart breaker.
B000AP04NI|5.0|One of the best movies ever made!  The music and comedy in this movie can't be beat.  Gordan MacRae had one of the best singing voices ever.  Aunt Ella is awesome and Shirley Jones is a delight.  Jud in this movie is the most evil, scary Jud I have seen.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Good to have Tom Clancy back with his usual flair for the action and hidden plot lines with young Jack leading the way.
B000I3PERS|5.0|I love this movie.  One of the best with mel Gibson! No dry eye left when watching this.  Such bravery and courage are seldom seen today!
B000UE29SW|5.0|My uncle passed away, and I was having a hard time. I bought this book at the recommendation of a friend, and it really help me cope with my uncles passing. Love this book.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Was a gift and my dad loved it!
B004SL6OBQ|4.0|Love it & the movie keeps me laughing & thinking about the one I love. The songs are great I love all the bird noises in some of them.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|A Very good book the  grandkids had to have it. It was delivered very fast. Thank you for the fast service.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I'm very happy with this app. Video selection works, no DL problems. Only one i've found so far to be consistent.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book, not only for its content which I found fascinating, but for the amenable and friendly tone in which it was written. I would recommend this book in anyone interested in Near Death Experiences and the promise of eternal life.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the best game ever if you want to use ur imagination this is the perfect game for u
B008XG1X18|4.0|Great way to learn new things.  At first, a little difficult to figure out how to organize but found lots of interesting topics and links.
B005Z28M58|5.0|no review.  Happy i now can watch the end of DHWs'... Will take my time now and watch the episodes when i feel like it..
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Wish I had money to spend on the upgrade!! Really got into this one!! Awesome graphics, cool story..pretty scary too!!
B005LAIIPS|3.0|My hubby is a BOURNE freak and we have watched every single movie.  It's just not the same without Matt Damon and the story line was okay but REALLY SLOW to get to the point.  There was alot more action in the other movies than this one.  Even my husband said it was okay.  And just when you think it is starting to get somewhere the movie ends!
B005LAII12|1.0|I like lots of movies - even if they're kid movies, or stupid movies, I'm pretty tolerant.  But this is in the top 5 worst movies I have ever watched in my life.  I'm hardly a prude and don't mind a little profanity, but holy cow this movie is over the top with bad language, extreme profanity, and piggish remarks and jokes that aren't even funny.  It's as if they think a bad or sexual word makes something funny.  It doesn't.  True humor obviously escapes the writer and the sad people who produced this.  As for the plot - oh for pete's sakes a child could do better.  I kept watching hoping it would get better.  Don't make that mistake - it doesn't.  In fact, don't watch it at all, it's a complete waste of time and money.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Great movie and with the bundle of three disks it is definitely a steal!<br />Great visuals in graphics and audio sound decent as well. A great buy! The extras are also a plus!
B009POCFTG|4.0|Don't know what all the fuss is about...where have all those \\"1 star\\" people been for the past ten years?  Under a rock?  Granted, Killer Joe does have its moments but nothing that should overly shock todays movie goer.  OK,...maybe the chicken scene...!  I thought the acting was great and am now a big fan of matthew M.  A scary, yet likable individual who does things with chicken parts that must have Col. Sanders rolling in his grave!  This movie will have a place in my collection.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great set that comes with all three of the movies. No bonus features are included.<br />It comes in three different disks which help as they come in different cases for each movie.<br />The case is flimsy though I must add as it is only a paper cover.
B003Y5USF0|5.0|I like disaster films, I don't have to live through it. I like Helen Hunt.  The special effects are great.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Great movie,<br /><br />Also with the price I got it was incredible as I was able to get blu ray, DVD and digital copy.<br />The colour and audio was great on our surround sound as well.
B0032KNA4I|4.0|Excellent special special effects.  It is impossible funny at times.  Great acting by all.  Don't miss this one.  A real ride.
B00008CMR6|5.0|One of my favorite Wayne films.  No one did a western like he did.  I try to add to my collection every so often.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|My friend suggested this little dude and I was hesitant to purchase it after my dismay with a similar binky holder for the Tommee Tippees, but this guy is great!<br />After watching her daughter with hers I thought I would give it a try and I am so happy I did. My little guy uses this at nap time and sometimes at night when he sleeps in his swing (upright). He will randomly spit the binkie out when he is sleeping and freak out during the middle of the night to find it. As long as he has not swatted it away, he can easily find it on his chest.<br /><br />I have heard that it improves when they get a little older and have more hand control, right now he is 3 months and is able to grab it but often tosses it instead of bringing it to his mouth.<br /><br />The monkey is very cute and comes with an avent binkie attached. You cannot remove the binkie, but you can easily clean it with the monkey attached.<br /><br />I will purchase this for many a baby shower coming up as it has been a great item to have.
B0079R8KXG|4.0|color is pinkish, stitching looks cheap<br />,but it works well for the money<br /><br />i would puchase again, great gift- you gotta have one
B007EECSFA|4.0|Nice twist to the story.<br />The flawed subject of the book is more than you think she is.<br />I like happy endings in life and death.
B005UBNKZG|5.0|excelente procesador, se rie de los juegos, si quieres utilizarlo al 100, puedes hacer un ripeo de pelicula con linux para que utilice los 8 procesadores al 100
B003KRGCTI|4.0|Great movie with a little twist in the end. I dont recall an explanation as to how the world got to that point but all in all, its a good movie.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I love this series.  This package got to me pretty fast.  Didn't expect it so soon but I'm not complaining.  I'm happy with it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great read! This story will leave you flipping page after page. I could not put it down. Great book to build anticipation for the final installment.
B005KELQEU|5.0|I know my children want mine however I refuse to give it up.<br />They can get their own, hah!<br />Thank you, Belkin!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Great game! Very addicting and fun! My son and I have spent some very good quality time problem solving each level.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry Birds is a simple yet highly enjoyable game. Perfect for all ages. There are a variety of levels to play. I highly recommend this game to everyone.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Enjoyed this book from beginning to end! Can't wait for next one!  Would definitely recommend to everyone!  Excited for next movie too.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Though not normally a fan of first-person narrative, I found this book well worth the time. Could be a true vision of a dystopian future for our world. The mystery of the other characters mindsets and motivations works well with the practicality and, sometimes, clueless view from the main character, Katniss.  Look forward to the next title from this author.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|works really well when you just want to past the time and don't want to think a lot. mindless entertainment
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|Great VFX and all around a good movie. I'd probably give it a good 7.5 out of 10. The sequel will be interesting...
B00632HWOG|4.0|It is a much better improvement but doesn't seem to completely sync my mailboxes.  I deleted several emails and they still show up on either my phone or kindle no matter how many times I refresh
B007IXWKUK|3.0|It was an okay read. Not a bad story, just a little predictable.  There was no cliff hanger at the end that made me want to purchase the next one.  It's a book built up on the hype of it's content, which is not much different than some of the romance novels of the 90s.
B000059T1E|5.0|when visiting the wikipedia page (associated with this album), i was shocked to find that this album received negative reviews! some critics insinuated that this album suffered, because dave mason had left the band, as he was the only one (in traffic) with talent!! sorry for the overuse of exclamation points, but to call steve winwood and jim capaldi untalented is laughable! yes, dave mason is a talented individual, but not at the exclusion of winwood and capaldi. i would actually argue that this amazing album wouldn't have happened, had mason still been with traffic. the album was more adventurous than any previous traffic album. the band made the move from single oriented rock to more album oriented rock. sales may have suffered a bit, but musically the band was never better.  in my opinion, this album and \\"low spark of high heeled boys\\" are traffic's two finest recording.
B004PAHZMC|4.0|This is great for storing Legos or toys in general.  One downside is that it doesn't seal completely, so if it gets upside down, legos will fall out from the corners.  Otherwise it is great for being a playmat that is portable, and has endless uses for travel, storage, etc.  I recommend it.  It could probably hold about 1000 or more legos.
B00A1XOPE8|3.0|Of the three Sanderson books I've read.....this one ranks third, Elantris second, with the Mistborn trilogy ranking a heavy first.<br />Love his work, style and attention to detail.<br /><br />The Emperor`s soul is quite straight forward and pretty predictable but an easy, quick and very enjoyable read. Would still recommend it to someone looking to pass the time and but  not necessarily someone looking for a moving, soul changing novel. Again, a good and short read. If you're not sure....just start it, it won't take you long to figure out if you love it it not.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|This was a really good book but not his best. I am really glad they made a movie of it. All of his books to movies are awesome.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I'm a fan of John Corey's irreverent humor. However, he wasn't up to his usual smart aleck self in \\"The Panther\\". It seemed to take more than half the book for anything to occur, then the action was not up to what we've learned to expect from DeMille. It was an okay read (3 stars) but not nearly as good as most any of DeMille's other John Corey books.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I use it for everything I want to look up. It has been a big help to me many times.
B00632HWOG|1.0|I was very happy with the application until the most recent update through the appstore. now its impossible to delete any messages. every time I refresh, the deleted messages come back even after I have supposedly deleted the trash as well. please fix this. I wish I had never updated this as I can no longer use the app to send and receive my mail.
0099474425|5.0|I am a fan of Georgette Heyer's historical novels, and this was the last one I needed to complete my collection.  As with all the others, it is an amusing, rollicking story that is hard to put down.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|No problems on my end, the news feed and picture viewing all work well. It is much better than the mobile site I was used to.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book. I really loved it. I would recommend it too anyone wanting to read a good romance book with a slight twist of suspense
B008JFUUIA|5.0|this was a christmas gift for my 16 year grand kid. she was so glad she got this. she was going to buy it with her christmas money.
B005LAIIS0|3.0|A deep and intense movie. Lots of strong emotion and some pretty good acting.<br /><br />Even though the CGI rendering of the wolves is excellent, I thought they tried to make the main boss-wolf a little too menacing by making it too dark, it looked more black than grey. I also thought that by trying to up the scary aspects of the wolves, the use of 'eyes in the dark' bent the whole thing a little too much toward the 'supernatural'.<br /><br />Great use of digital shooting gear and looks fab on a BIG screen.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I am now so excited to see this movie, I believe this is one of the most inspiring piece of literature written in the last ten years
B008NEMN0K|4.0|Well, reasonably so. I like this film, did from its cinema release and on DVD. On Blu-ray is it awesome. The 3D conversion version is worth the extra coin and the actual conversion has been done extremely well, with few, if any, artifacts or depth-of field/focus screw-ups.<br /><br />While Will Smith was his typical self, showing (I think), the right amount of strength, weakness, brashness and humour, I have always thought that the part of Susan Calvin was rather underplayed by Bridget Moynahan and that a more animated performance was required, from someone like Sandra Bullock, or even Mary McDonnell (now that would be interesting).<br /><br />There are plenty of reviews out there that say pretty much what I would, although I personally think this movie is a lot better than it has generally been given credit for. While I liked the DVD, the 3D Blu-ray version is stunning. The 3D effect has worked a treat and the upgrade to the soundtrack is fabulous. I have the advantage of now, (since a major upgrade), watching movies at home via a quality projector on a really big (136&#34; 16:9) screen, which makes the 3D experience (and the 11.2 sound experience too) simply mind-blowing. Just like the experience of watching 3D in a big-screen suburban cinema, the picture envelopes you and the depth of the 3D becomes an almost natural view (except for the fact that you need special specs).
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this game is really fun and addicting. it did quite a challenge on some levels,which will force one to think.
B004YOEFG8|5.0|Filmed entirely (almost) with the IMAX 3D system, the vision is impeccable. Soundtrack is awesome, but needs a high quality, full range system, with lots of headroom and really good subwoofers to hear it all. The launch sequences are truly speaker-breaking (for less-than-adequate systems). Like all/most IMAX films, the quality of the high resolution video, seen on a BIG screen is always impressive and this film is no different. Some scenes are simply awesome (that word again), and with most shots, especially of the Hubble itself while under repair/refit, being shot with a stationary camera, you get a chance to look around the scene to see some of the minutiae. One small bonus for me was seeing the actual work required to break off a troublesome handle that got in the way. The vantage points they managed, especially around the launch pad, are just fabulous.<br /><br />A top film, stunning, made with care. Too bad they could only afford to send up 1 mile of film. And we need to constantly remind ourselves that IMAX allows a max of 10 minutes of shooting per reel. Changing reels in space would have been fun.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book made me think of my past and my future and the wonderful life I have with my husband. I can't relate to overcoming the same obstacles and relate to the love that Dean and Hope shared. A very touching and inspiring book.
B004MPESSY|4.0|This is a very disturbing movie. The assault is horrible and the revenge is intense. I actually felt my jaw drop a few times without realizing it. If you dont mind some extreme nasty and a little trauma to your mind, I highly recommend this movie.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|Personally I don't particularly like realistic fiction because it is to much of real life and isn't mystically and different, but [[ASIN:B0054R6BFM Thirteen Reasons Why]] is the exception. I love this book because it shows real problems that are going on today in our schools today. It shows the immaturity in youth and how people don't understand how their actions and words will affect someone. If you single out reasons that Hanna faces they wouldn't be something to kill your self over, but when you have them all piled on one person it isn't hard for them to just give up. You don't know what is going on in someones life your little joke could affect someone differently than you intend. I would recommend this book to any over the age of 12. I believe that this book should be in all school and public libraries and it should be mandatory for high school students to read.<br />And maybe, just maybe we can decrease the amount of bulling and suicide in teens.
1571200851|5.0|This is a fantastic book.  It is origami in fabric.  It also has the advantage of being based on a square so that you can sew the flowers into a quilt.  Couldn't believe how many different options it gave.  Definitely value for money.
B003MC5N28|5.0|We all dream of the perfect world where everything is at peace there is no racism or heart break or pain. Well in [[ASIN:0385732554 The Giver]] Lois Lowry takes you to this world.<br />Everyone has the same colored skin so there is no racism. You don't worry about heart break because your spouse is chosen for you. Can't decide what color shirt to wear well no need everything is the same color. Even if you don't think you are good at anything a job is assigned to you. Physical and mental deficiency from birth? no worry every baby is up to up to par. Don't like today's music no need there is no music. Rude remarks are not tolerated.<br />This book is a great example of how utopias don't work. A utopia is an ideal place with social perfection, but this cannot be achieved. When your job is chosen for you and you can't change it you don't always get something you particularly want. This book follows Jonas and his journey through this utopia.<br />And don't for get this is a trilogy!<br />[[ASIN:0385371829 The Worlds of Lois Lowry 3-Copy Boxed Set (The Giver, Messenger, Gathering Blue)]]
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|ONCE AGAIN, Seth MacFarlane  HAS DONE IT. LEWD, CRUDE AND JUST PLAIN FUNNY. BUT, ALSO A LOVE STORY, BETWEEN TED AND JOHN, THEN COMES LORI AS THE GIRLFRIEND...  VERY GOOD FLICK!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Darker still has the redundant text, but as always James produces a great storyline! A page turner I finished in less than 48 hours.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|They found a way to continue the series while changing our main character. I compare them to the series of James Bond films..where there is a new actor playing our hero every 3 film's with no explanation as to how or why this happened. The Bourne series is about our own government making kill squads and the politics and actions of covering them up when they go south. excellent series.
B0028ER4Q4|5.0|When you're in a spin, a permanent frown. Down is up and up is down. Your pinky is your thumb or maybe your toe. The product of a drug which many people know? This is my one of my favorite albums, from one of my favorite bands. It is easy listening. It's Jim Morrison's creepy lullaby to the world and we should thank him. This vinyl is heavy (literally), clean sounding, free from many pops and ticks with a depth unmatched by digital media. This is an album to own, to cherish. There is not one dud on this. Not one. Get this!<br /><br />P.S. If the title got that Doobie Brothers song stuck in your head, I apologize fiercely.
B004EKCNMA|4.0|A Christmas Carol is one of my favorite Christmas stories but when you add incredible computer animation, it's even better. Some scenes may be too intense for small children but the message is good. Sadly, some of the effects do not transfer to tv as well as it was on the big screen but it won't notice it's missing if you didn't see at the theater.<br /><br />I find it easy sometimes to get lost in the animation and forget the story which is why I give it 4 stars because even though it is amazing, it should not cause you to miss the story...but who can't help but stare mindlessly at the grotesque face of Scrooge or the chest hair of the ghost of Christmas present. Maybe it's just me. Luckily, the shot moves and you snap out of it soon enough
B008CYDDWI|5.0|ReAnimator should not be taken seriously. It is a horror comedy a la Evil Dead 2. It is ridiculous. If you go in expecting a straight horror, you're gonna have a bad time. That said, this is great! The blu-ray isn't amazing quality but it was a barebones budget movie. If you like horror, or schlocky fun horror get this!
0525478817|5.0|This is one of those books that should be on everybody's \\"100-books-to-read-before-you-die\\"list's. It's so beautifully depressing (I don't know how else to put it). It makes you reflect on who you are, and it makes you think about who you want to be.<br /><br />Teenager's will be able to relate to it, and adults will no doubt love it, as well.<br /><br />However, if you don't enjoy things that will make you sad, then don't read it. A little spoiler alert: it will make you sad. Very, very, sad. Aka, it will make you cry so much that you won't be able to read, and you need 10 minutes to calm yourself down before you can continue. And then you read more, and then you cry more... it's one of those never ending cycles.<br /><br />However, despite the fact that it is so sad, you should read it.<br /><br />Beautifully depressing, indeed.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|Lots of one liners that make fun of each other's past movies. Lots of good action, and good special effects.
B009GIPDQS|2.0|This book is a complete let down. John Grisham is losing his touch. His books are becoming predictable & losing the edge.
B00005JLH3|4.0|For those of us who slogged day after day to learn routines for marching band, practiced religiously to keep first chair and just generally loved being in the band.  There are a few too many four letter words for younger children.
1419705849|5.0|I bought this book for my 8 y/o daughter, and 11 y/o son. They loved it. According to them its hilarious. My daughter recommends this for all kids of her age group.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Screen is overwhelmed  with icons and a lot of goal want you to post to facebook... in fact my reveiw is a goal in the game to earn points...
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This movie is an up beat and fun musical. It is an entertaining movie for the whole family to enjoy.
B003E8P9G0|4.0|Well written with great characters, accurate setting details.  Side and Carter are worth your time.  Get to know them today!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wow.....I picked it up and never put it down. I'm still left in wonder about the relationship between katniss and peeta.
B002VUFKG6|4.0|I like her research perspectives on marriage, age, culture, etc.  Still reading and enjoying her angst with marriage.<br />I can relate
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A truly spectacular novel, beautifully written and makes you wonder about the meaning of life itself. The characters are well-developed and relatable. Another triumph by John Green.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I enjoyed this book.  I liked that it came for a neurosurgeon with scientific backing as he discussed areas of the brain.  His story id amazing
B005ISZRES|5.0|Awesome.  One of the best books I've ever read, an I can't wait to read little men, which is good 2
B004DLPXAO|4.0|It took a lot of steps to install this on my tablet.  I think that is due to the Android OS not so much Kindle.  I enjoy the software a great deal and would very much recommend it.
B003WUYRGI|2.0|I kind of liked it not really because it's not a book that I would want to read but it's and okay book.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|the app provides a wide selection of the most popular translations used in the US. It is easy to use. Navigation is fairly straight forward. I wish that it supported a permanent download of the NIV translations. It has the NKJV which is ok but I prefer the NIV or NIV84.
B00170DEM8|1.0|Holiday Inn express Amarillo West charged me $145 for a room which I didn't use. My wife called from the road late at night to check on room availability. Unfortunately she gave her Credit Card number to reserved the room and forgot to tell the representative that we had a dog. Big mistake, An hour later I went to check in and found that the dog was not allowed. I tried to cancel and was told the cancellation charge was the full room rate. The person at the desk was extremely rude and obnoxious and at that point I told him I would dispute it with my credit card company. He later told me we could have the dog in our room for $50 which would have made the room $195 for 6hours since it was 1:00AM and we would be leaving at 7:00AM I was so upset at that point I just left and found another room at a Best Western. I will never stay at a Holiday Inn again as long as I live.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Lots of funs. Keeps you occupied for sure. Great time suck<br />Fun with levels and lots of new stuff to do.
B009HELT3C|4.0|Watched with some friends and we all agreed that  especially for a sequel, the movie was very good in keeping with the flavor of the original.<br />What so commonly happens is that multi sequels just keep adding more and more action,<br />usually going way over the top.<br />However MBI3 had the action and added heart !
B003IEJZUG|5.0|I love a book that makes you wonder, where there are questions at the end. An  Excellent must  read novel.
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|Some friends told us they liked this movie.  It wasn't nearly as good as I thought it would be.  Below average rental.
B00A6PD8RQ|2.0|Not my favorite Pixar movie, usually the story lines are much better. I could have done with out this one.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|This Mumford & Sons CD is wonderful!  Their music is addictive and I enjoy listening to their songs and lyrics.  I love it!
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|I am a fan of Seth MacFarlane and Family Guy so I figured I would love this movie. While I found the movie entertaining, I didn't enjoy the movie as much as I thought I would have.
B008NW67E0|5.0|What can I say . . . the music on this Mumford & Sons CD is fantastic!  I love it!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Child constructed another Reacher adventure that entices and captures the reader's interest. This one is a little different than others, but it leaves the reader wondering if this could really happen. Has big government gotten this big? If so, how does the illusive Reacher escape yet again? If you are a fan of Lee Child books, you must read this one.
B00ABXA1HI|2.0|After installing., my windows 7 laptop slowed down to an unacceptable level. Couldn't spend time figuring out problem., so I ended up reverting laptop to earlier state. However., I was able to control laptop with kindle fire.
B004GHNIRK|2.0|Believe it or don't believe it, but you'll find the chapter on the history of the sewers of Paris quite interesting. The Battle of Waterloo I had to slog through, but I'm still glad I read the entire book.<br /><br />This isn't the best translation of a classic novel.
1451695195|5.0|This was given as a gift so didn't read it myself but I am told it was very good book and was interesting.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|This is the real deal. Charles Dickens wrote the story like this. It's the classic story of a man named Scrooge who hates Christmas and is somewhat mean to his employee. On the night of Christmas Eve, he is warned by the ghost of his former co-worker that three Christmas ghosts will visit him during the night. That's enough about the story for now. I recommend this book to everyone who... that's it. This is the perfect story, especially for this time of year. It will warm your heart and make you smile. The best part is, it is FREE!
B004BSFC46|5.0|these are very cute. a good idea before they are able to grip for themselves. the rattle is very slight. almost too quiet.
0758232225|5.0|Though the portion of writing about the grandmother's daughter seemed a bit slow to me, I realized the significance of it all and that portion of story telling was weaved in quite nicely.  My focus was on Marcus and the vividness with which Vanessa conveyed him: glasses, no glasses, breathing, breath-taking, interest; no interest...and to top it all off, scriptures graced each chapter. After reading the chapter, I found myself going back to the scripture to see how it was tied in with the development of the chapter.  I thoroughly enjoyed the novel and am going to go pick up another.  Good reading.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Great format to watch this epic movie in.  The extras provided a lot of extra entertainment.  The extended versions and the Family Dialogue options were very well received.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book would read it a million times!!!! If you get a chance read this! It keeps your attention the whole time reading it.
B004GGTAQE|5.0|I have been studying the second world war for years and have recently turned my attention to the Eastern Front, i.e. the German operations in Russia 1941-1945. The author seems to me a stereotypical German, and exhibits many of the finer aspects of that stereotype. He indicates no particular attachment to Nazi beliefs, but is a committed and patriotic German. He is intelligent and thoughtful about practical matters and abstract ideas that underlay the reasons for the war. From him you get an honest and unflinching explanation for his participation in the war, and he attests that it was his experience that was shared by most of the troops he had contact with. Impossible not to admire this man as a soldier and as a warrior, and to learn a lot at the same time. A very good read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome. Me and my friend try to compete against each other to see who gets a higher score haha.this game is FUN
0439023521|5.0|This book came in an envelope and safely wrapped, even though its paperback it doesnt rip easy, i loved reading it and keeping this book! :D
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is really good. Totally worth reading,don't be afraid to read because it is about cancer and death because it is much more then that. Just freaking read the book
B004GJYRA0|5.0|This is a film i had always searched for at Best Buy or WalMart and never found. I found it online for a great price and i absolutely adore this movie! it was worth the price!
B0083ZRAJS|3.0|It was interesting and fun to read. Even though it is 24 chapters, every single one is exciting and full of action and elaboration and  nothing is boring in the book#
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love reading, but very rarely have I not been able to put a book down. This was definitely one where I stayed up way too late reading because I just couldn't stop reading. I loved it and definitely would recommend it!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I LOVED this book, I'm so glad my friend told me about it. Charlie is a character that we can relate to in pretty much anyway. He's a young kid just going through the biggest bitch ever which is life and freshman year. This book is just amazing
B000GCFG7E|4.0|Like all the Jack Reacher novels, it is fast paced and amazingly believable despite the violence.  I liked it very much.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Amazing book.  I could not put my kindle fire down.  Can't wait to start reading the next book to see what happens
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Prometheus is an excellent visual effects movie. It is the perfect prequel to the Alien saga. However, there are a number of continuity errors and the plot is very confusing. Only watch this movie if you enjoyed the Alien saga or if you are accustomed to Ridley Scott's style. All in all, a good one.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I decided to check out a sample and wasn't expecting much. What a ride.<br /><br />The story is engrossing and entertaining. There is some fairly graphic violent depictions however the author gives you ample warning if you want to skip ahead.<br /><br />The main character is not much different than many other ones out there like Mitch Rapp, for instance, but I really enjoyed his sense of humor and interesting (if sometimes a little over the top unbelievable) deductions.The main thing is he kept the pages flying by as fast as I could touch my screen.<br /><br />My only problem was picturing Jack Reacher after seeing so many Tom Cruise commercials. But I'm not too concerned since there are plenty more Reacher books out there to help me adjust my imagination.
B00367XA1K|5.0|I wondered what it would be like, seeing the film again 31 years after I'd seen it before.  It holds up remarkably well--a fascinating portrayal of some fascinating people (John Reed, Louise Bryant, Emma Goldman, Eugine O'Neill, among  others) commented on my real witnesses (very old in 1980) who had lived though the years just before and after the Russian Revolution,  Also fascinating--the accompanying documentary on the making of Reds (produced, written, directed and starred in by Warren Beatty).
B00000ILDE|5.0|Bought this movie as a replacement for my husband.  This is one of his favorite movies, so he was happy to have another copy.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|I have never had a book overtake me like this before. Twilight nor the Hunger Games ever affected me as much as the Delirium trilogy. Lauren Oliver takes you to a place unimaginable chaotic and creates a beautiful story in the midst of it all.<br />The ending of Pandemonium left me breathless and eager to read the final book. It is simply fantastic.
B0063GORYU|4.0|challenging and intuitive. No need to drag and drop, a tap is all you need<br />. This was one of the first apps I purchased after I recieved my new kindle fire
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Couldn't put it down!! Ending was touching ..the love Jo must have had for her family . Who wouldn't fall in love with Alex and his children.
B0000942LT|5.0|I absolutely thought this CD was outstanding. I do not understand why most fans have a problem with the more mellow and upbeat tones of the album's songs. I thought it was a good change. It shows Staind can take a step out of their norm and still create a master piece and it is something I can respect about them. The diversity of the album is shallow though with many of the songs sounding alike which is one of the few things I disliked. Break the Cycle had very diverse tracks and I thought over all 14 Shades of Grey wasn't as good but it was a great CD still. For any true fan of Staind who has more then just one taste in music will enjoy this album a lot. My favorite tracks were So Far Away and Fill Me Up. Buy this CD!
B0092QITO2|3.0|THERE ARE NO SPOILERS WITHlN!<br /><br />First off, this is a HIGH 3-pointer…if Amazon had a 9- or 10-point system I’d have given it a 7.  It’s a good remake of the original, but doesn’t score high in any category but one (ish): special effects.  (More about them later.)<br /><br />My philosophy is the same for music covers as movie retreads: if you’re going to remake a classic, do something new with it.  Re-interpret it...make it distinctly your own.  And when it comes to movies, add an angle no one’s thought of.  Give the hero or bad guy different motives.  Set it in a different era.  Whatever: make it your own.  Why else remake it?<br /><br />But other than update the effects, “Total Recall” really refuses to go its own way.  In fact, I’d be more prone to knock a film that does so little to win a new audience, but as “Total Recall” pretty much lives or dies with its effects, this one thing has to be enough...and that is a possibility, especially if you haven't seen the original.  Let’s face it: if you’re reading this review, it’s probably the biggest reason you’re thinking of seeing this movie anyway.<br /><br />So let’s talk about those effects.  If you’re as old as me then you’ll remember how the original movie was noteworthy for the technical ground it broke. In fact, the Oscars honored it with a Special Achievement Award for Best Visual Effects in 1990..a recognition that it was THE film of the year in that category—no other film was even nominated.  Here, though, as accomplished as these effects are, they don’t deserve THAT kind of recognition.<br /><br />A large part of the original’s success was due to director Paul Verhoeven, who equally instilled “Robocop” and “Starship Troopers” with savvy and clever FX.  He had a way of using technology as a plot device, furthering the story rather than merely outfitting it in order to fill space and time.  For instance, the continual use of newscasts and advertisements in those movies imbued them with clever commentaries on the societies in which they were set.<br /><br />Here, the effects are certainly eye-opening, but only occasionally did they come close to the eye-popping “Gee Whiz!” of the original.  There is a scene in which their hovercar’s vertical control is switched off in order to release them from the flow of traffic, and the drop sequence is pretty stunning...especially the moment they regain control.  You can see the scene in the trailer: the cars beneath them are crushed by contact with the car’s airjets--not by the car itself.  In this scene, the FX create an intelligent surprise.<br /><br />Additionally, elevators fling their characters about, not only vertically, but sideways as well—all at top speed (I'd hate to be drinking coffee in this future.).  A nice touch was also supplied by the confusion the effects gave the characters themselves, as in a couple of scenes where 3D holography convinced Quaid that this or that was real when indeed it was no more than a projection...for HIM.<br /><br />So, yes, the effects are dazzling at times, but I felt they had the quality that mars a lot of CGI in movies--that is, it OVERDOES the technology.  If you’ve seen anything in the last decade, from “Star Wars” to “The Mummy” to “the Matrix” to “John Carter”—scenes are composed of MILLIONS of characters or other gewgaws that crowd the frame in order to overwhelm the audience.  Yet what is gained through gimmickry is ultimately lost through the audience’s overstimulation.<br /><br />For instance, the scenes outside their &#34;neighborhood&#34; are quite obviously meant to depict a society with out of control growth, with living quarter heaped on living quarter in a dismal, wet, overcrowded borough that, despite its technology, was still basically a slum.

1401937519|5.0|I was watching Dr. Wayne Dyer recently and saw Anita on his show & became interested in reading her book. I gained a lot of this knowledge from the Abraham teachings, but her book really helped me with a couple of things that have confused me. I came from a family with a horrific genetic disease that killed half my family. I was always confused as to how we \\"attracted\\" this gene in the womb, and Abraham seemed to indicate it is possible for newborns through some vibration from the parents.  But Anita's book made me feel positive about something I have sensed inside all my life---that we came as a group and \\"chose\\" to express ourselves through this disease. Although it was one of the hardest experiences for all of us that I can imagine, I can look at every person in my family (dead & alive), and I know that we are all so much more than we would have been without this disease. What an incredible \\"journey\\" it has been. The only thing I wish Anita had explained more in this book is how our experiences in this life translate when we die & go back to who we really are. Abraham says that as we grow & expand in this life, Source Energy grows & expands through us.  But for something that is already pure, positive energy, it's hard for me to understand what \\"expansion\\" or \\"growth\\" would even mean. How does something \\"grow\\" that already sounds perfect \\"as is?\\" So--I've read a lot of teachings on our purpose here & why we keep coming back, but I really would have liked for Anita to elaborate more on this purpose from her NDE perspective.<br /><br />One amazing thing that clicked for me in reading Anita's book is that We Are God!!! I have believed this for a very long time, but somehow it was simply knowledge--the same as \\"hell\\" is a concept for most Christians, but they never really think about it or understand what something that horrific would really mean in terms of God. Reading Anita's book caused something to \\"click\\" or \\"turn on\\" inside of me, and I just suddenly knew howamazing that is---that the thing we have all been taught all our lives to worship and to believe was outside of ourselves is actually what we are and what we will always be!  It has already changed some things for me in just the few days since I finished the book! I would recommend this book for everyone!  I can tell from some of the reviews that some people just haven't reached a place yet to accept some of it, but that's okay. We are all perfect just the way we are & at whatever place we are!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I loved this book!!! As an avid reader of the Pendergast series, this book answered alot of questions and tied in people, places and things.I want more!

0547884591|5.0|I have been a huge fan of Tim Ferris and his books since I read The 4-Hour Workweek 5 years ago. It truly changed the way I thought about work, life, and having it all. But the 4 Hour Body truly changed my life. It made me leaner, healthier, and stronger and I have been on the Slow Carb diet for over 6 months now. I had no doubt The 4-Hour Chef would give me another glimpse into Tim Ferris' obsessive thirst for knowledge and optimization.<br /><br />I love the fact that these books fit my lifestyle. I can read a little bit of a time, skip ahead, refer back and fit them into small opportunities throughout the day. This book reads like a magazine to me with great examples in small tasty morsels. It is almost as the author is teaching us how to cook by feeding us one bite at a time. Consider it a cross between Gourmet, Scientific American, and Reader's Digest.<br /><br />My favorite quote is \\"Career specialists can't externalize what they've internalized. Second nature is hard to teach.\\" I will print that out and put on my desk much like Tim put Bobby Flay's quote on his. Thanks to Tim for another life changeing book! Now on to making me some Sexy-Time Steak!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book was awe inspiring in many ways. I thought that it was awesome how the author's writing got better as the character became a better author.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Emotional, heartfelt, page turner, consistency, build up, twists, unpredictable, beautiful, tear jerker, intense, lovely, humor, sarcasm and finally tears of gratitude and hope. When I say this book keeps you up late at night....there's a whole new meaning. I started reading this book at 9pm at night and finished it at 7am the next morning. Only taking shorts breaks to pee, snack and smoke a cigarette due to my induced panic! This now lays in the top of my 3 favorite books of all time!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book! Holder and Sky were great. This book had just the right amount of everything, and was so well written. I highly recommend it.

B000092ZYX|5.0|Hail to the Thief is, in my opinion, like Radiohead's \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\"; They combined a few elements of their alternative rock works (Go to Sleep, 2+2=5) and their experimental work (Sit Down Stand Up, Where I End and You Begin). I can see clearly how this album helped \\"shape up\\" In Rainbows.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn does it again, the Mitch Rapp character is so real. I love the way he writes and hooks you from the first paragraph to the last word. A must read.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Typical timely Clancy look at our future potential adversaries.  Good and plausible plot involving China torn between modernization and tyranny.
B000JML7YC|3.0|So I wanted to read this book because I love the movie so much, and I wanted to read all the Jane Austen books. But I found that the movie was more dramatic than the book...well of course it had to be or else it wouldnt have done well. I did like the book, but it was like pulling my hair out to get through it. I like Jane Austen, but I feel like her books are too wordy. I felt that it was true for Northanger Abbey too.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|We gave our grandson the sonic in August when he was 3 years old.  Obviously, he is too young to watch most of the series.  But his parents have recorded a few episodes that are acceptable and then skip over anything that might seem violent.  He loves his sonic, his Mom has one too!  He and his Mom and Dad dressed up as #4, #10, and #11 for Halloween!  They looked fantastic...great parents.  Sometimes I let our grandson pretend he is opening our car door or something else and he loves it!
B004P2CQM4|3.0|very  tedious to put together. the gear on the motor didn't travel the length of the rail so I had to cut the part out with toenail clippers. works great now but my son says \\"the r/c range is 50 cm not 50 ft\\". its sad because otherwise it would be alot of fun. I'd love to hear if anyone knows how to fix the r/c.

B003V4AK8E|5.0|I love the controller so far. It's responsive, the curvature is great, and it looks cool because of its red lights. It's battery life is standard, it's easy to set up, and of course it's only 30$.<br />The ONE and only complaint that I have is that the grips might irritate your skin after a while, but its a minor complaint.<br />Don't listen to that \\"dead zone\\" garbage cause its fine.<br />Hope this helps in your decision.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Best fantasy booking have ever had the pleasure of reading, I cannot wait to read the sequel and hope that the author isn't too long in finishing the trilogy.

B002VPE1WK|2.0|This backpack seemed like a good deal at first, until I wanted to take it on a hike.  It really isn't designed to accommodate taking food, raincoat or jacket, water, etc. in addition to camera gear. You could tuck a very light garment into the elastic cord on the back, and I did reluctantly put a water bottle in the same compartment as the lenses, etc.  There are two small outside side pockets which are handy - a few more would be helpful.  There are loops on one side that can be used to attach a tripod. However, a tripod on one side makes the pack unbalanced. On one shoot, I lifted the bag with its contents of lenses and gear, not heavy at all, and the top handle tore loose. Apparently the stitching wasn't well done. Fortunately the main shoulder straps are still okay, but I probably wouldn't trust this bag on any extended or important outing.
B0015AARJI|3.0|Overall, this controller is one of the best ever made; in a personal tie with the Wii Classic Pro and Gamecube Controllers. The MSRP, at $55, is ridiculously overpriced, though.<br /><br />The major problem I have with this controller are the L2/R2 analog trigger buttons - they are worthless. They are not concave and the angle at which they move makes it difficult to maintain finger placement. Imagine a gun trigger that, instead of being concave to the finger, was the opposite. It literally hurts to use these buttons because of the way they move and the way they are molded. Also, they do not register until they are depressed half way. The buttons are not sensitive at all. Sony may as well have designed them to be digital I/O.<br /><br />Another problem I noticed is that the dual analog sticks have worn around their shafts. The sharp edge of the controller's casing has whittled away at the buttons within only a few weeks of use. At this rate, it seems that the analog buttons will eventually break off their mounts and the controller will become entirely useless.<br /><br />Until Sony redesigned the L2/R2 buttons and smooths out the sharp edge of the casing that holds the analog sticks in place, this controller only earns 3 of 5 stars from me.<br /><br />Even though I have not used any third-party Dualshock controllers, I would recommend trying one of those first. Look for good reviews and make an informed decision. Because of the lack of quality in the Sony brand controller (and the sticker shock they induce) going with an off-brand may be worth a shot.
0385535147|5.0|I have been a John Grisham fan since the beginning. The Racketeer did not disappoint. It kept me guessing, Is Bannister good or bad? Would make a good movie.
B00AMSLRAC|4.0|The Dr. Panda games are some of the best I've come across for kids, but this one can be frustrating at times. The little tools that are used to rake out the gardens can be difficult to pick up and use. My two year old will almost always ask me for help when it pops up, and if she doesn't ask for help, she's just frustrated and done playing.<br /><br />*sigh* Terrible Two...<br /><br />Aside from the mini game frustration however, it's another great Dr. Panda game! I'm not sure what it is about digital farming that is so much fun, but this game doesn't disappoint in that aspect. Starting vegetables from seed and progressing all the way through harvest really gives kids a sense of accomplishment.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|These movies were on my great granddaughters Xmas wish list. I was thrilled to get her something that she really wanted. Thank you for making a 12 year old very happy.

B005LAIH4A|4.0|I liked the movie for the most part. One song in there was too long and really annoying- didn't like it for my kids.
B000068GA4|4.0|Played the cassette out in my car like it was going outta style. Danzig sounds like a cross between Jim Morrison and Roy Orbison with some Black Sabbath thrown in (instrumentally speaking anyway.  His vocal style is different than any of Sabbath's vocalists). Best songs are: 777, Blood And Tears, Long Way Back, Serpents, Devil's Plaything. Really cool album. Brings back some interesting times for me.
B000UPGQQW|5.0|I love this movie the movie is kinda funny but theirs a lot of action in it sorta even though its taking forever to come in the mail i still love this movie
B00004UQBP|4.0|I refer to a title for another reviewers review of this product. What is he/she talkin bout? What exactly does that mean anyway, \\"seeds of brilliance\\"?? Floyd was always brilliant! Even in the days of Piper @ The Gates Of Dawn, these guys music was trailblazing. In fact, Imo, the best Floyd stuff to me was during the pre Darkside of The Moon era. Ummagumma compiles a live disc and a studio disc. The live disc is good all the way through. no filler BS. The studio disc has it's shining moments (ie Several Species Of Small Furry Animals Grooving With A Pic) but is nowhere near as brilliant as the live disc.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Just a great movie would recommend this to anybody hope they make another one it. Could have stuck to the book a little closer but owell
B008P1EWIM|4.0|Graphics are good.Help is poor - can't add additional locations and the contact site does not accept e-mails so still can't get any more locations or help.<br /><br />The above was my first impression of this app. However, it has really turned out to be quite accurate and it's very easy to add new locations - just need to explore a little.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Good to here the true story instead of the gov. Version and also how these heros  have taken care of us .just a great book
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I received the video in a timely manner. I thought it was a video everyone should see. It arrived in good condition. I have watched it many times. I would recommend this video to everyone.
B005LAIHRC|5.0|I rented this through Amazon, intending to watch it over the next day or two. Made the mistake of watching a bit right after renting it, & couldn't tear myself away!! Tom Cruise was WONDERFUL as usual -- totally believable, & a great singer!!!  Julianne Hough was AMAZING!!!  What a dynamic voice!!! Diega Boneta as Drew was AMAZING too!!  Actually, I thought ALL the singers were terrific, including Alec Baldwin!! It was a bit risque, but the overall story was GREAT...especially if you're a rock fan from the 70s & 80s as I was!! LOVED the ending, too!!  I've now ordered the DVD, to have it in my collection, to watch again. Will look for the soundtrack & buy that, too, as the music was INCREDIBLE!!!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|The game has some good puzzles! Sometimes it could be a little difficult to see hidden objects that were placed under other objects.
0316069434|3.0|I am a loyal Harry Bosch reader. I will read them until the saga ends, but this book went from far-fetched to ridiculous! The premise was fantastic, and up until the end, I was right there turning the pages. However, the end was not what we are accustomed to in the Bosch novels. The end came crashing down with an unbelievable ending, and I felt a bit disappointed. The realism of the LA detective, listening to his jazz music, with priceless jargon was highly compromised in the end of this book. It was as if the ending was not coming to Connelly, so he just made up a wild and outlandish ending.<br /><br />I am still a fan, but hopefully the next chapter in the series will get back to its roots and be more plausible!
1609611543|5.0|Read it through and found it interesting.  Sure that our food is tainted with growth hormones, all kinds of tinkering to get it to be bigger and better at our expense.  Doubt I could make the full change in diet, but those quoted are certainly convincing.
0679735259|3.0|I can appreciate both the positive and negative reviews written about this book. In a word, I would describe this book as \\"visceral.\\"<br /><br />As someone who served in combat, although not Vietnam, I can appreciate the raw emotion and sensory overload that makes this book work. The language and descriptions of combat are second-to-none, and as a veteran some of the verses really made me pause to reflect on my own experiences.<br /><br />That being said, as a literary work, this book is difficult and contains a great deal of jargon that many may not understand. The anecdotes are raw and uncensored, which is both good and bad. I agree with some of the other comments that there is little structure, and it can read like one rambling thought followed by more rambling thoughts. I had a tough time keeping up with years, locations, and units. Herr discusses drug use in the book, and it reads like some type of a drug induced trip.<br /><br />I would say for veterans it is worthwhile, but for a succinct history of the war, or war tale, this is not the book for you!
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|If you're a fan of Tina, definitely read this. The book is heavy with her cynical tone and humor, using them to talk about her life and what she's learned over time.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is a very well crafted survival story with a Magiver like character that was very funny over and over again.
B006R6ZP6U|3.0|You have to pay attention in the beginning as the Grimm brothers give the viewer their backgrounds.  Many characters intrduced quickly.  As the movie settles in, it is likeable with the action.  Good family movie.
B0084BMUFA|4.0|The description inside talks about pictures. There was only text, no pictures in the Kindle version. Drawings would have been nice.
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|WOW!  So much development to the characters and the enviromental facters, which are constantly a threating presence.  Makes you wonders how much you could endure to survive.  Unexpected ending. A must for Liam Neeson fans.
0718157672|4.0|At first I was dismayed at all the information for one meal on one page when there were so many pages used for photos of the meals,  HOWEVER after reading through some of the pages and then going to the 15 minute meals book by Jamie, where there is so much less per page because there is not so much to be organised for the meal, I realised that the format in 30 minute meals was perfect.  No turning pages, there are clear headings and everything is in steps to help the cook pace themselves to a successful outcome.
B0033AX1YG|5.0|If you are a Gary Moore fan, and you wouldn't be reading this if you weren't, you will enjoy this for sure. Sometimes it's not the best video but it's still great to see/hear Gary in action. R.I.P. Gary Moore
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This game is good fun and not too taxing after a long day. The music is pleasantly soothing and the graphics are very good.I just wish there were more puzzles! But hey! it' s free :)

0316227706|5.0|What an amazing book!  I absolutely love all of these giggly full-page, full-color photos.  The photographer, Seth Casteel, is a genius.  Not only did I gift this book to friends and family but I got one for myself.  It's a very clever coffee table book.
B005CKPQ7A|5.0|Arguably one of the best seasons of this fantastic series. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are at their best. Awesome.

B00AC8ZJPQ|4.0|I was a little unsure if I would like this movie or not. I am a huge Halo fan and love the Halo games and when I watched this movie I actually really enjoyed it. There were a few things that seemed like they could have been done differently and I thought that it was a little slow to start off, but it picked up pace quick enough to keep my attention.

B006K3796E|5.0|Bought this for a Christmas prize for a game.  Was a bit skeptical at first with some of the reviews, but went on with the purchase.  Everybody wants a turn!
0061689246|3.0|Stardust is a fine book. There is nothing \\"wrong\\" or \\"bad\\" about it, and in-fact I very much enjoyed it. There's just something missing... it has an almost vapid quality that I just couldn't get past. It dabbled in fantastical elements, such as Goblins and Magic and Kingdoms and the sort- but none of it is ever explained, and really none of it matters that much. Sure it's whimsical and it's supposed to be more than a little tongue-in-cheek, but after a while I just wished Gaiman took things more seriously. I didn't go into it expecting an epic fantasy that explored every nook and nuance but I also would have appreciated more than just the continuous name dropping of random places and events. Again, the point of the book is that it's lighthearted and fun, but by the end a lot of it just feels sort of irrelevant. Gaiman gets carried away nodding and winking at you instead of giving you substance to sink your teeth into.<br /><br />I give Stardust three stars because it's a good book, and a quick and pleasant read for those unconcerned with immense detail and exposition, but there's a  point where you sort of wish the straights were more dire and the prose more serious.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Keeps my girls busy, they love it. Easy,fast,lots of hints to help them along. Good graphics. Fun game to play.

B00APUYN0I|1.0|This motion picture has nothing to recommend itself. It is inane and boring.  Must I really say more? Two more words?  O.K.  Stupid and puerile.
B000VWOV3O|5.0|I haven't gotten my copy from Amazon yet, but my friend let me borrow his. What a great collection. I had most of these in the late '70's. I don't care how little information is in this package. I can look stuff up online. It would have been nice if this set came with a booklet with liner notes, but it would have been twice as much money. John McLaughlin's Mahavishnu Orchestra has always been my favorite jazz fusion ensemble. If you're curious about the Mahavishnu Orchestra, this is a low cost way to get five terrific albums...although I must admit I love \\"The Inner Mounting Flame\\" the most, as it was the first I ever heard from these guys!!! Ten stars!!!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Angry Birds on Kindle Fire...This game can become both addictive and frustrating. Fun to play and easy to pause. Good game.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|Not very innovative.  Jeremy Renner is dull.  Story line a bit too ridiculous. Could be the end of a &#34;Legacy&#34;.
B007EDYN36|5.0|Peter's autobiography was a great read could't put it down!  A must read for Kiss fans, he is painfully honest on his own problems and truely gives you an inside look into Kiss.
