B00JE28GBA|1|discolrs in the sun and found on ground near car after a rain storm. it took longer to arrive (4-6 weeks) and only lasted about 2 weeks
B000LV7XR6|5|Needed to replace my OEM wipers on my 2007 Audi Q7 after 8 years. Didn't want to pay for OEM wipers at the dealership even with the 15% mailer coupons my local dealership sends me. Bought these for my front windshield (you need to buy two and will fit both driver & passenger sides). They're not cheap by any standards but welcome to the world of German luxury automobile parts. Great wipers and ridiculously easy to install. Even a tech guy (me) who sits in front of a computer all day can replace both wipers in under 5 minutes. Have had the wipers for about a year now in drought stricken California but they work like a champ when it does rain. Highly recommend. I just wish these things were cheaper.
B00D8GSF1O|5|Great product . Lights are bright and helps me see. Fit my 99 honda cbr 600
B00993LEKY|4|very useful
B001IH8PXI|5|very nice
B001DKT0DO|5|Just what I needed. Hard to find in stores these days. Easy to install, and function really well. A+ service, wonderful price.
B003TY5X2Y|5|Quick delivery.  Excellent product.
B00FAS9YBS|1|The switch I was sent does not fit in the car!
B00CZ4NQVY|1|I'm pretty mad at this product and hate to leave a bad review, but I feel it's necessary. I ordered these for my 06 civic hybrid, because in the description it says it fits my model and engine. Well, they do not fit, so I have to return them. This is the first time I've received a product that the description was just totally off. I'm very disappointed in this, and hope the seller will change the description. So buyer beware, the place where the bolt goes is facing the wrong way, and there is absolutely no way to make them fit. Believe me, I tried because I really wanted them to work.
B00H6XPZN6|1|doesn't stick to the window. falls constantly
B001NI7KE2|5|Good item very fast delivery.
B005U9JF5W|3|Cute and pretty but didn't seem to really reflect much heat.
B001NZSFHG|5|Perfect fit for my 2005 Dodge Ram.
B00192JGA8|5|does the job
B00S5ZXC7A|1|Just didn't work, sent it back.
B00VXQP7VC|5|Nice sturdy construction, shipped fast, worked great.<br /><br />TIP:  The replacement bolts are Allen Key bolts :)<br />TIP 2:  Take the Bed off so you can get a good swing at the shackle bolts.(leave the on the very end of the bolt as you hammer it so as not to mushroom the end of the bolt making it impossible to remove with out cutting)<br />TIP 3:  Spray the old bolts with penetrating oil twice a day while you wait for your new shackles<br /><br />Gave me all the clearance I needed for 31 x 10.50 x 15
B004DRY0CK|4|Product came on time, but they are not black. They are crystal clear. But they still looked good on my Tacoma. Installation sucked due to the fact that I hit a tree, and the areas you are supposed to mount them too were bent. I was overall pleased with this purchase, would buy again!!
B001AMCD5M|5|Exactly what I needed. No issues whatsoever. Installed with new struts and my Redline is back to riding great.
B007REFW32|2|I didn't really like this decal when I was trying to place it on my MacBook it was very inaccurate and gave me a hard time for the most part
B00NF18C4C|1|No. The rivet for the hinge link support is not available for replacement
B007RY5BJM|4|Dont remember.
B003CEN0U8|5|works well
B00MFE7XFE|5|Worked great, set mine to 16 lbs by using the spare tire. Very quick, ended up having the other guys at the jeep event borrowing mine to get out on the trail more quickly.
B005DSS4PC|3|There is nothing OEM about these. The quality is ok but they are what I would describe as inexpensive non-OEM. Beware of SLOW shipping. They arrived direct from China and took a month to arrive. Overall ok but not BMW original or OEM.
B00SLKQHXK|4|I am surprised that so many people can't figure out that the left center and right center brackets are miss labeled. Swap those two and everything fits and bolts up fine. Leave everything finger tight and rattle the boards around until everything settles in and then tighten down. It's not rocket surgery.
B0007PHD0S|5|Simple and effective!  Nuf said
B00CPGQ1GO|5|i needed this !
B00NS6W6S2|5|Excellent
B00C5D09B0|3|I was pleased with delivery but item lacked side holes that lines up with truck.  Other than that I am ok with it.
B001EA0LJK|5|Perfect and it fit 2 cars!
B00D6OK4XK|1|these tires have been completely worn out with less than 3 thousand miles.  Bald and unsafe, must replace with another tire.
B00RH8OG9Y|5|worked great
B00BPKR7K0|5|Great wire, used it for a grounding it and very flexible so easy to hide if you don't go for the bright cables but also easy to place where you want it. Holding up well for being in an engine compartment.
B00RB06Q0U|5|love it, cheap but  nice
B00XWDB8Q2|5|Love this tape! I Have ordered the blue twice  and will order more colors as i do more mini bikes. Will make any rim stand out. Highly recommend . I wanna put this stuff on everything. Wheres my cat!
B00032K4FG|4|Great product, only down fall is it should be sold in sets of 2
B00FEXEG1W|1|All measurements listed fit my car perfectly. However, there are &#34;Things&#34; underneath each & every vehicle, like my own, as well as trim, angles, non-accessible (&#34;DO NOT DRILL HERE!&#34;) sections, & other issues that make this hard, baby plastic-like &#34;Spoiler&#34; anything but &#34;Universal&#34;. Tried, just for curiosity, on 3 other similarly shaped front sections on 3 other cars-same problems as with my car; everything I mentioned.<br /><br />Seller stated to me that &#34;Universal doesn't mean Vehicle specific&#34;. EXACTLY! This is Vehicle specific, & not flexible enough (even heated) to fit many many vehicles within the measurements listed.<br /><br />Aside from those issues, this is very cheap & unless you plan on painting them, will look very cheap. The price is very fair at 45.00-&#34;You get what you pay for&#34;....<br /><br />I won't mention what I ended up getting instead of this, after seller refused return/refund & amazon, after reviewing the issue, refunded me 100%, because then I'll be accused of being affiliated with the &#34;Perfect&#34;  Spoiler I installed today. I am a Detailer & could have made these fit by cutting & trimming etc., but I bought them to go with the flat black front grille & also wanted a simple installation, so I passed.<br /><br />BTW, came with nothing else. No &#34;Self tapping screws&#34;, instructions, tips-nothing as advertised was included.<br /><br />Bottom line; If you have a really nice car & are not Detailing-experienced (Cutting/trimming/painting etc), avoid these, because there are much better & much nicer options at close to the same price, THAT ARE UNIVERSAL & WILL FIT, right out of the package.<br /><br />If Seller TRIES refuting my claims, I will be happy to post photo's showing exactly why these spoilers will simply not work on many vehicles, because after refusing a return/refund, I expect defensive action from Sellers who stick people with items that aren't compatible with said applications & lie (Universal).  Amazon doesn't just refund buyers, they investigate both the buyers & sellers claims. They refunded me 100% & added on a 25.00 gift card. Says it ALL.lie (Universal).  Amazon doesn't just refund buyers, they investigate both the buyers & sellers claims. They refunded me 100% & added on a 25.00 gift card. Says it ALL.
B00877SL2M|4|Lights are bad ass thanks seller!!
B00MTYOLV4|5|Nice little accent for the computer
B001O08ADO|4|look great, and the key is a good length, but after taking them off 2 times with an impact gun they start to scratch, even when the key is a snug fit. I would by these again and most likely will once the ones i have are banged up. If you take them off and on not with a impact gun than they should hold up well.
B0002NIM6E|1|I bought this for my boyfriend and he did not like how it fit in his car I wanted to return them and they will not allow me because it's been over 30 days. I don't know what to do with them. Very bad customer service
B00J1TJVBA|5|Received it in two days, it's a high quality plastic, easy to install and comes with instructions. Only thing is you have to buy the emblem separate or I did because my old grille did not have one. 5stars
B000ALJYEW|5|We were gifted one and were so impressed with how well it eliminated the blind spot, that we purchased one for the other side of the car.  It did amazing as well.  I still check my blind spot, but this mirror has always shown if a car is in that spot if you adjust it well.<br /><br />Mirror goes on and off with two screws in minutes.  No special tools required, and the mirror portion is easily adjustable.<br /><br />It seems once you have the mirror set that it works for any driver.  My husband and I never re-adjust those mirrors even though we have to adjust the usual/normal ones.  It must be because it captures such a wide area.
B00AYA3Q0M|5|Great quality and fits perfectly in my 2015 Tacoma. the fact that it covers the &#34;hump&#34; in the back floor board is a nice addition.
B000C5O02M|5|Works well with the jeep, remember to reset your computer eny time you change a sensor on your jeep. I hard these sensors were the same as OEM and I am pleased.
B005VP3E02|5|This was an exact replacement part for a light assembly that was smashed to pieces (literally).  The item arrived when promised, was well packaged and was an exact replacement.  It took about 15 minutes to install and saved hundeds from taking the vehicle to a repair shop.  If you can use a screw driver, you can do this yourself!
B000CB0KEI|5|will buy again
B00110WIDU|5|Thanks I already received my stuff thanks
B00O7YCQ9S|5|These aren't extra large but just the right size so other drivers aren't beeping horns or riding the bumper making your beginner even more nervous. As my son makes little mistakes the magnets let other drivers understand so they don't think it's a drunk driver or anything. I would definitely buy these again.
B002UC1AYQ|5|It works great on my camper toilet.  Easy to install too.
B00EAN6URA|1|Poorly made Installed It didn't work pulled tank again checked pump plug in down In pump not even plugged in spend the extra money get a good one
B00T47X44O|5|I installed the product in my GY6 125cc scooter and it works really good. GOOFIT Complete Variator Assy for GY6 is a remarkable product and I am extremely happy with it. The installation took just a couple of minutes and my bike is working just fine. A highly recommended product owning GY6 scooters.
B001NHAP36|5|Arrived 4 days earlier than expected. Can't beat that. Fits perfect and easy access on my RZR 900 S.
B0069SF8CM|5|Perfect OEM product. Good price.
B001G5W128|5|Great product , item was as described , fits with no problems .....Excellent. ..
B00VF4INZY|4|👍
B00GNCTRKS|5|Simple installation, simple instructions, perfect fit.
B00KRN409C|5|great lights. Super bright and easy to install. Only recommend purchasing load resistors due to hyper flash. Unless your like me and that doesn't bother you.
B001JT98HM|4|I bought this for my wife who sadly still smokes. We bought a new vehicle and they no longer put ashtrays in them. This solved the problem. No more stinking soda cans to deal with.
B00RWO6MYA|5|After researching many light bars, I decided that a roof mounted light bar on my 2014 lifted GMC truck would offer the most illumination over a greater distance, as opposed to a grill or bumper mount. (I frequently travel through the North Woods of N.H. and V.T.) I found many 50 inch lights that ranged in price from $100.00 to $1500.00, but none of them compared in quality or output, to this one. This unit throws 48,000 Lumans of light that turns night into day. However, I chose not to use the brackets that came with bar, as they seem to be designed more for a Jeep or commercial utility type vehicle. After extensive searching for mounting brackets, I chose the Putco brackets that are designed to take advantage of the roof channels in the 2014 to 2015 Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra1500 series pickup trucks. These brackets bring the light bar right down over the top of the windshield, and the curved bar compliments the looks, in addition to spreading the light. The challenge here, was that this bar is slightly shorter by about 1 1/2 inches, than those designed specifically for my vehicle. Using the brackets in the roof channels, I could not move the brackets closer together. So, with the help of my mechanic friend, he designed and tooled spacers made from stainless steel, which locked the light bar in place nicely. ( Thank you Joel, from Ron's Automotive in Hanover Ma.) I've only been using this light for a little over a week, so I can't comment on it's longevity, but it appears to be all quality and durable. (read the specs). I ordered this from Amazon, and it arrived well packaged in three days. In my opinion, it's the &#34;best bang for the buck&#34;.
B00ISR8OLY|5|look great on my truck and fast shipping..
B007Z09GE4|1|Did not come with a captive screw so I had to reuse the screw from the old solenoid. Screw hole on new solenoid didn't capture the screw and I lost the screw when I was installing the new solenoid. Had to take the valve cover off to locate and retrieve the screw. Once everything was put back together I fired up the truck and found out the new solenoid was faulty. I can't return it because the packaging is now gone.
B00KGKI9JS|1|Terrible product. First one I got did not work. second one I got worked one time. Looked into returning again and discovered that my 30 day warranty was up.....<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Customer service agreed to refund price of item and allow return. Great company, still lousy charger.
B000IYHDA8|1|The pump was defective. I thought since it was new that it was no longer my problem and spent an enormous amount of money on other solutions before finally figuring out the pump was not good.  I am in the process of waiting for my refund and will see how that turns out. So far it seems like it is going to go thru for the fuel pump.
B00BXC6AP8|5|Worked really well.
B00ELR3XM0|4|Works great easy to install.
B00A2DWOJK|5|Very innovative product from Eevelle, would buy again, very reasonably priced
B00C8E9CBY|5|Work great
B00M0VQ830|1|I bought these coz i have really nice and expensive wheels on my car. I bought these thinking they were unique and the security rate would be high, but they are not one off and anyone can purchase a key and take you wheels, also one of the lug's threading was stripped and could not be used. My fault for buying on Amazon i guess.
B00EHIPQ1E|5|Awesome
B002S9UY3E|5|Exact part
B0098RDK44|5|Perfect fit XL.Looks cool.Super quiet at higher speed.
B00BE5J3SK|5|My cover now works like it is brand new. The cover pops up and actually stays up now.
B002BB633O|5|Fans were perfect unfortunately  that wasn't the only issue the air was having. Thanks for the speedy shipment.
B000AP8DZY|5|the best Wax
B000CLAYUS|5|Not hard to install....I was amazed at the nasty gunk on the old one....definitely a smart purchase!  :)
B004GEW89M|5|Perfect fit.
B001LHVOVK|5|It's an amazingly reasonable price for a tool that quickly diagnoses the reason for a check engine light. Also resets light (for at least several engine cycles until the computer detects the problem again). Obviously, you don't want to reset and ignore a serious engine problem, but not all check engine situations require repair immediately - or, potentially, ever.
B005RSUOBU|1|Bent when received .
B005ZWM0R4|4|Works fantastic for finding problems, if it tunes I can't figure that out a no instructions for tuning so idk maybe. I have used it to fix lots of issues on lots of different vehicles.
B0000CBIK5|5|This is the only bike pump I bought that always makes me smile when I use it. I bought this at $6, tax included, delivered in my front door. Cheaper than Walmart. It has no bells and whistles, just a plain pump which delivers air to my kids' bike tires. I don't need a gauge. I already have a tire pressure gauge to do that. Pretty durable. Used it 2x/month for 5 bikes. Still working after 6 months.
B000CITD08|5|This is great, I love this new proformence throttle body. Paired with a new cold air intake system i can tell a difference in my 97 v6 mustang. If your looking for a reason to upgrade your mustang i urge you to start here.
B00CJ7HTNI|5|Stays in place ......buying another it works so well
B001UC72UI|5|Great product - worked perfectly.
B0048FUSN2|5|Purchased for a family member whose dashboard was all cracked. She loves it and said it was easy to install.
B00065ZIJ2|5|very easy to install
B004QHJKRC|5|Ordered these wheel bearing hubs for my 2003 Corolla. I had 135,000 miles on it and it had original hubs on it. I thought I could hear the passenger side starting to make noise. Anyway received these, pulled drums and pulled and replaced wheel bearing hubs on both sides. Very easy change. Took about 15 minutes each side and inspected drums and shoes while I was in there. No issues with those although I had a kit to replace them. Test drove and all went well. Much quieter and smoother ride. Not sure how long they will last compared to OEM hubs but these fit perfect, installed easy and very cheap and road very smooth.Will check on them every tire rotation to see how they progress in wear. Even if they don't last as long, they are way cheaper to replace compared to $250.00 each OEM hubs from Toyota. At that price, I could just R&R these every 2-3 years (30,000 miles) and still save money over the long run. Turned out to be a great productive project that needed done. The OEM hubs didn't have any end play but you could feel the bearings getting rough compared to these new ones. It was time.  Very happy!<br /><br />* Aug 03, 2017 30,000 miles on them and no issues.Still very smooth rotation & no endplay.  Great cheap replacement so far. Will update again! Replaced Aug 2015. Still going strong.
B004HYNGDS|5|Fit perfectly. Easy to attach. Looks great. A nice product!
B006P5BKBM|5|Excellent product top shelf quality without the price tag.. Looks very nice.. 1990 Nissan 240sx
B00LAJTEFW|5|Kept breaking rubber stems off on my tractor so I bought these bad boys.  They are beastly, very heavy duty, and great build quality.
B001G79VMY|5|Perfect fit 1995 miata 1.8L
B00KF9180W|5|As expected - a great buy. I ordered these balaclava's because I could get two for the price of one and they received a lot of positive reviews. I have a normal sized (somewhat small) head and my husband has a large head. These fit us both with no problem. I like that they have pockets on the sides over the ears that can accommodate eat muffs or hot hands. The stitching is solid, the fabric is soft, and they do not have an odor. I wanted these on hand before the cold weather set in - they arrived three days after I ordered them. I attend a lot of football games in the mountains where the winters are cold, windy, wet, and snowy. We also visit upstate NY in the winter. We plan to wear these under our hats in hopes they will shield the wind and insulate against the cold as advertised. I will update my review after putting them to the test this winter.
B0059JUC9G|5|Nice product! Works extremely well for long rides especially this past week at Sturgis!!
B00BN5XV0M|5|Worth the money!
B00Z4H3SSA|5|fits 100%
B007TXYSRC|5|the mirror  for Chevy door worked  out perfectly.  delivery was prompt and appreciated  Thankyou
B00S75A5IW|5|The light output is very nice, crystal clear white light.  I had issues with other LEDs which had the fan, adding bulk to the body.  This prevented me from installing them.  These fit very nicely.  Hopefully they last.
B00ZOKJVAG|4|I got the product as early as expected. I tried one of the three shade in the package and found it cling to the window very well. But I think it blocks the sun less than I want. The ad on Amazon says it would block 97% of UV. I really hope that this is a true claim.  But I still want it to blocks more light than it does now.  Another thing I don't like is it doesn't look good from the outside of the car with all bubbles trapped in it.
B007Q13SK0|5|Bought this to fix a leak on the oil filter on my 07 G6 3.5 GT, no longer leaks after applying this.
B000PDI1E4|5|Great mats. Fit great.
B00P9R1TH2|5|Perfect for new gas cans.  Take the spout out, and use these to seal well.
B009AC45T6|5|These boots were everything that I expected. Great fit on my lifted K5 Blazer and excellent quality.
B00NORK0G0|5|Great place to get Decals.
B004KMKCIO|1|Broke after 1 use.
B001AWFRWI|5|Got it on Saturday with Prime shipping. Taking it out of the package took the most time. Easy to put together and a perfect fit on my 2002 Volusia. Looks great and I'm looking forward to using it.
B004FFHJ14|4|works great but is bulky
B00XPTPHWE|2|This mirror does not include the electrical connections for trucks with electric mirror adjustment controls on the drivers side...
B00AQ29G4I|5|These rims are great!! Look very good on my 2004 Honda Civic. Had no problems installing it either, very easy. Already bought a second one for a friend of mine! Awesome product!!

B0079WX0X6|1|It does not fit for lacer ex gt I bought it and returned it

B00DR357BY|5|Quick Summary Review<br /><br />1. Highly detailed<br />2. Very durable (I've had this on my suv & wife's for almost 2yrs now) color did Not fade and the sticker is still holding strong and nice<br />3. Easy to apply<br />4. Great price and extremely fast shipping<br /><br />Reactions from people are awesome<br />Will definitely be buying again for future vehicles<br />Thanks again Amazon for another great purchase and service
B00O124N8I|5|These were purchased for a 2000 Silverado 1500 4x4..While not exactly bent like the factory ones, the bends were very close and they &#34;snaked&#34; their way around and along the axle, differential, and suspension parts fine. No leaks after install. The whole job took about 15 minutes (Not counting bleeding the lines, that took another 20 minutes) Mine were extremely rusted so the day before I sprayed the fittings with PB blaster and let it sit until the next day and they broke loose with relative ease. A little pricey compared to the unbent straight lines from the parts store, but well worth it for the time and headache you save not having to bend straight lines!
B00ZFO66PY|3|Fitment was perfect. It looks OEM in the bumper.<br />Quality is poor. The adjustment screw does nothing. The threads didn't line up, so turning the screw just made clicking sounds, but it didn't move anything.<br />The lens is plastic, whereas the OEM one is glass. I'm OK with it being plastic, but it seems to fog up a lot. It's either the fact that its plastic or that the vent isn't made right, but it's constantly fogged up. I didn't replace my other glass one and it's fine.
B00TKXXL8Q|3|Had to do some work to make it fit but over all seems to be a good part
B001418YQ6|5|Really cool!<br />Looks great on my car.<br />Go Buffs!
B0006VORDY|5|This unit is very well built with excellent burners.I have it in my garage and use it for fried Chicken where I really need to control the heat. You cannot get that from an electric stove. I plan on using it on camping trips and any power outage if necessary. The price is excellent for the quality and I am sure it will last many years.
B005BOQR1Q|5|Fit great
B00FHSOTWU|5|Fiancé loves the helmet matches my green one.
B000EAIERW|4|Nice hand holds. Feel good in your hands and very easy to install.

B00OA7V2DS|5|worked perfect, same as the originals, will buy again when needed
B000SKV4U2|5|love it
B00XP97HEA|4|Ok fit not what I was expecting, these are not just plug and play modification to inner wheel wel plastic needs to be done as well as the screws that come with could be a bit longer.
B00CVVUQ50|1|two months they are changing colors looks like crap don't waste your money
B004I12MXU|5|Perfect fit for oem replacement. Comes with complete harness.
B007DKQGQC|4|I love this sticker! It came in perfect condition and is very bright - just like the advirtized picture. It seems a little small on my car, but then again I have an SUV.
B007Y1PP4E|5|Vroom vroom!
B0002SRH60|5|This worked perfectly for me with an extremely stuck set of brake drums. It took as much force as a very powerful impact wrench could dish out.  I would speculate that this would be almost impossible to break because the drum or wheel studs will give up first. The only small downside is that the handle is too small to be useful on anything even moderately stuck. Plan on using a breaker bar or impact.
B00MNZFWD0|5|Wife put this on the outdoor kitchen fridge in our camper as soon as she seen them.
B00U7CLVLS|1|Doesn't communicate properly over Bluetooth with phone or PC. Unfortunately I didn't have need to try it out until after the return period was past, so I'm stuck .
B00FYX21SM|5|better than what Hyundai sells
B000CPCOQ6|5|Great product
B00JJQ6LJ0|5|Love these! I put them on my knee scooter after surgery and I get a lot of laughs. Excellent quality and sticks on great..
B007VR7Q48|5|These look great.
B00KJ17UFS|5|Great light. Very bright. Descent price
B001OMEOG4|4|So these fit in the stock location pretty well, but as others have said, they have a gap at the top where they are not sealed properly.  I bought a tube of clear silicon from the local hardware store and filled the small gap.  Seem to be OK for now, but I just got them.  Time will tell.
B00RBR4JM0|5|Genuine Toyota part and yes it fit perfectly.  Those caps which were supposed to be alternatives just didn't look right and I decided to pay the extra cost and get what I knew would fit correctly, which it does.
B000TYSJ8W|5|Quality clips used on 94 f150
B002VFWTDS|5|Fantastic vacuum and heppa filters are great as well.
B00NIXN4IQ|5|I crashed recentlyrics wearing this and it protected me very well
B000EDQR4Q|3|doesn't fit the fridge in our camper. May work in others.
B00068XCQU|5|Have only used this Battery Tender Plus for a few weeks, but it seems to do everything claimed.  I've tested the output with a slightly discharged UPS battery and it goes the each of the modes as advertised.  Very pleased with the purchase.
B001LHVOVK|5|This was at a great price, works great, just what I needed.
B00V3VJ6AK|5|Step up one size larger for perfect fit.
B00QKPGDRS|1|never buy boston decal again. whore through on first ride.
B00AXH9HGS|5|A perfect part for the right price. Perfect fit. 1400 miles now and still pulling hard stops as needed.
B0002SA3VQ|3|I love Bestop products, but this bikini top is a bit long for my 78 CJ5.  The top somewhat obscures my view through my rear view mirror.  If the top fit my Jeep as illustrated, it would not be a problem!
B001445IZ8|5|Worked like a charm on my S55 AMG
B007ZDY8IA|5|love it
B00OMYK83O|5|Worked great to cover tanks and at a great price.
B010YRRRPE|5|Great product will be ordering more
B00P9SLKW0|4|work well and are easy to use.
B00SLYXZAO|2|All four came off car on same tire...do not purchase for a Nissan Versa!
B0058J4O7S|5|Came as said in the description!! Very happy with the product!! Nothing was broke! Again very pleased!!
B00DZRR9TK|4|Very cool boots.  A little difficult to slip on, but provide very good protection.  Not for hiking.
B00BC1Z29A|4|These are basically heavy duty stick ons. However, I think they are great adds that not only protect my car but are also very eye appealing. They are also very easy to install; requires about 5 minutes each side. Anyone that's able to read and follow instructions should have no problem installing, them.
B007VXD100|5|Great 3rd brakelight and also fixed leak that is common with Ford F-150  third brakelight. Fit 2009 model perfectly.
B00HESFIJ4|5|Quick delivery, excellent Accu-Gage quality.  My 4th Accu-Gage product.
B00TI0F8DM|5|Great product thank u fast delivery
B000CMHVJO|5|I got a friend to help me install this torsion bar tailgate lift on my 2002 Silverado. Installation was straight forward but definitely needed two people and a six-pack. It took two old farts a little over an hour with most of the time arguing over exactly where the holes should be drilled. After getting the holes drilled getting the torsion bar seated in the holes was a bit of a challenge but a few beers and some manly grunts and it was done.<br /><br />The result is well worth the effort. The gate opens with a softer feel and closes easily with just two fingers. This is definitely the one to buy.
B008G2OTWY|5|VERY GOOG WOULD ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN
B00826OVWW|3|great idea ,works well but had to redrill some holes because who ever lined up the pads was drunk,and the padding is not very good .
B000C3DD5E|5|This clutch works amazing! I was having an overheating issue with my temperature almost hitting red then going back down to half after easing up off the throttle. I put this guy in and it stays well below half on the coolant temp sensor. Buy it!
B008S7GCWC|5|VERY GOOD PRODUCT
B00GBBEETU|5|It worked out great
B00KSDKWZ2|5|This is just what you need to keep on the center console for resting your arm.
B00GXRG3DW|5|These microfiber towels are extremely well made and super plush. Easily the best quality microfiber I have bought to date. I will be ordering many more for use with my conneseur detailing service.
B00HRRQ10W|5|Is a beautifull emblem.
B003WDEYPE|5|does the trick
B0009NUG66|5|After reading reviews decided to purchase this top carrier for my 2014 Rav 4. We were traveling with camping gear from Southern Massachusetts to Lake George, NY. Five hours plus of traveling through highways and we were pleasantly surprised with the Rightline Gear. It was easy to secure, had lots of space and could not even feel it on our roof,no noise,no moves or shifts. I did purchased the non skid mat but seemed unnecessary since the product comes with a non skid bottom. Not sure if I will return because will have to eat the cost of shipping and does not seem worth it. I would highly recommend this product.
B00W6J0I6O|1|Yes, they went on fairly easy and stay on great
B00X1230TM|3|This is not shiny at all.
B000IZ2Y06|5|Ok, I have a 93 mustang and LOTS of experience changing lock actuators out on these things.  I had previously ordered from my favorite mustang parts store which rhymes with ate odel pesto.  Anyway I had installed one and it was weak, the other didnt work, got free replacement after drilling it out again and replacing, too weak to pop lock without several tries.  Gave it a few weeks, but no joy.  Fed up even tho was offered free replacement again, I went with dorman.  Man the difference is night and day, they are NOT the same manufacturer, the electric motor is bigger, stronger, (and louder), than the other one.  I put this thing in and it pops up with authority, almost too much as it makes a loud and proud &#34;kachunk&#34; Wish I went with them first.  After 3 months no problems, if you have a fox body mustang, don't hesitate this is the one you want to use.  Believe me you may not want to be able to learn to swap these in 15mins like I can now after doing it 4 times.  First time I would say going slow 1.5 hours but I was going slow and meticulous.
B00V55NE0M|5|It's on my car and hope it makes people think about the 2016 Presidential Election and Ted Cruz!
B003NBFMMY|5|Used this on our 10 day road trip and it rained a few times on us but everything in the bag stayed dry! Highly recommend!
B005NLQAHS|4|I was extremely skeptical about this product at first but saw all the good reviews so i figured i would add to the good reviews. I am going to start with the only bad thing about this product and that was the packaging. It arrived in a box that looked like it was gnawed on by a velociraptor. Besides that the product miraculously connected to my phone right out of the box. I downloaded the program torque and it connected to the ecu of both my 2005 mazda rx8 and my 2010 chevy camaro 2SS. I am extremely happy with this product and its ability to read the ecu of my cars. I would without a doubt reccomend this to anyone having CEL issues or somply wish to view their vehicles diagnostics.
B004TRKBOK|4|A little smaller than I imagined but will do the job I intended. Haven't had to use it yet, thank God, but the size may come into good effect as far as where to store it in the vehicle.
B0042Z0XWY|5|very nice
B000EQTZU6|5|had to change wires, works great, would buy again
B00NO0CRKO|5|Perfect
B00396ZH1Y|5|Worked great.....good adhesion........durable.
B0080MXQFQ|1|Was wrong size
B00JIIZCM6|5|Really nice product, cleans my shoes and bags really well.
B0014BCFC0|4|It works well; but I don't know how effective it is with filtering. I give 4 stars because it is very good. Five stars rating will have to be  superior. I hope they reinforce thicker tubes at both ends so you can feel confident when tighten the hose clamps. One time it leaked then I turned another 1/4 turn until it stops. You will feel that you can keep turning and it is definitively necking the hoses. So do not tighten it too much.
B00TH6MBNM|5|GREAT ITEM
B000BNS9EK|5|Good product.  Quick install
B002302CAG|5|Perfect fit for my work truck.  I have had this for about 4 months now and the cord and clips have held up very well.  No sign of wear.  Very impressed.
B004J8JBTA|5|The best I have ever owned
B000E7YP7I|5|Perfect for the back of my SUV so watermelon, etc. don't roll around.  I did put velcro on the bottom and the container doesn't move around on its own when I make a turn
B001AMCCB2|5|Great job on my van
B00GJMPYWC|5|Fits great, comfortable, and visible. And it looks good.
B003CK0P8C|5|A1A
B010H0QV00|5|I wasn't sure what to expect with the quality of a multi-tool device. Oftentimes when something has a bunch of different purposes, none of them work very well. That's definitely NOT the case with the DB Power 9-in-1 Digital Tire Pressure gauge. This thing is solid in your hand and each tool works exactly as it should.<br /><br />The tools included are:<br /><br />-Glass hammer<br />-Screwdriver (philips head)<br />-Screwdriver (flat head)<br />-Seat belt cutter<br />-Pliers<br />-Scissors<br />-Flashlight<br />-LED (red)<br />-Digital Tire Gauge<br /><br />The tire gauge shows 4 types of tire pressure : PSI, BAR, Kpa and KG/CM2. You change them by pressing the ON button until you reach the desired reading.<br /><br />The device will hold the reading for 90 seconds, then clear automatically. To turn the device off, hold down the power button for 3 seconds.<br /><br />Each of the tools are made of strong, quality steel that won't break with use. This is a wonderful and useful safety device for your car. I think it would be a great thoughtful gift for new drivers, along with basic car maintenance instruction. I received a sample for evaluation and I have no hesitation in recommending this, it's very nice.
B00LUMBNIA|4|I installed this meter on my motorcycle after having voltage regulator/rectifier problems and it works great.  The only issue is during the day it's impossible to read w/o covering it with my glove to block the light.  Don't know if an LCD would be any better but I have a mileage computer that displays LCD and it's easy to read in the sunlight.  If that is an issue then don't buy this gauge, however it appears well built and claims to be waterproof.  Haven't tested that feature yet.
B00L48SH0C|5|2015 jeep Cherokee latitude perfect fit love it Fast shipping a plus seller
B00PBO0Z3M|5|The only complaint I have, is the left parking lamp assembly gets moisture in it.
B008E04Q8U|1|Horrible plastic junk
B007J7E2XI|5|Added a nice touch to all the bengals grill gear we have. Catches the grease if any falls and also cleans up very well. Love it!
B0006H8BGC|1|the glass came broken
B001ABPKUS|5|Fit perfectly.
B00BBGMT7Y|5|This stuff works great for breaking up the dried on/hard to get off stuff that normally needed some scrubbing to get off. Just wish it removed mud stains, but great product
B0027QWNGO|3|These are hard to find.  Really good deal.
B0002UNON8|5|I had placed a large hood decal on the hood of my Grand Cherokee. After a couple months of the SoCal sun it started fading so I removed it. It left a sticky substance that drove me crazy so I tried to remove it with a towel and then, I know it was stupid, with one of those green and yellow scotchbrite pads people use to clean kitchens. I thought I was going very lightly as to not scratch anything but guess what...I had light scratches right in the middle of my hood and still had glue from the decal. My jeep is black and the scratches started looking milky. Drove me crazy. So I used a Fit It Pro pen, which is total garbage. Don't waste your money.<br /><br />Was searching online and came across lots of brands like TurtleWax, Mothers, Meguiars, and others. So off to autozone I go. I decided on the Meguiars. Got a 7oz bottle and a couple round terry applicators. Got home and cleaned the hood and applied the Meguiars.  I did a couple coats just to be sure. Wiped it off with a microfiber towel and now it is totally gone. I have to look really hard to even find where the scratches were. And trust me I looked very hard to find it still there. Now I don't know what will happen after I was the jeep again but for now I could not be happier. Buy this product with confidence.
B008KPZ02K|1|Wouldn't even power up with the Caltric stator behind it!!! Junk!! Don't waste your time or money!!!!
B00BYH6C1E|5|Thought these might be a gimmick but they really do work!
B007RVQX10|5|These do what they say and are designed for! What more can you ask?
B000CO7NGI|5|Have not installed at this time; am keeping as spares to have available when needed.  Am hoping their quality will be comparable to the European-made versions.
B0029012P6|5|Use in my New Holland and continue to love PRI-G and PRI-D.. Beats the competition hands down in my opinion.
B0088V424S|4|I have it on the fuel door of my car.
B00BITJM4W|5|Watch the YouTube videos but do NOT follow them. Absolutely no need to remove the inside door cover. Just use T30 screw driver to loosen the lock screw and leave the screw in place (don't try to take it out). Then insert the key into the lock and jiggle it to take the lock out. Put in the new handle, the lock back in, and screw the star screw tight again. That's it! I installed two front handles in less than 3 minutes.  Update: Initially the new handles have to be pushed back after closing the doors, as some other reviewers pointed out. But after several days, they now go back automatically. I guess they are like some new shoes, needing a few wearings to break in.
B00B2FPAVG|5|Purchased this for my 2014 Ducati Multistrada. It works much better than the stock screen by eliminating the buffeting. Fit was perfect and installation was easy.
B00B8SEBB2|5|Heavy duty mats exactly as described in post. Bought for my 2012 Maxima and they fit perfectly. Very happy. Time will tell if the hold up properly.
B004BTI1B6|5|Great +++
B002V0ZPNO|4|It did not remove black streaks. Trying other products for that.
B00DM9JBCO|1|Utter garbage. The adhesive is very weak and the instructions were followed to the letter. It barely adhered to the surface and showed signs of peeling on the first day of application. This product is trash. You come out better making a stencil or using some tape and a black magic marker. I'm so disappointed. Save your money people.
B009DJYGY0|4|Everything was great thanks
B00AE1M9YK|2|Feels really nice once threaded up. But it split at the seam just as I was a couple of inches away from finishing up.
B00IGNPIEQ|5|Couldn't be any more happier with this product, looks great in my red cav, bright and the bean spreads well
B00K7JMWWS|4|Didn't require cutting of my undertail like it said. Instead I just trimmed the tag bracket. Blinkers are bright. Really cleaned the tail up, looks great. About 1 hour install time. Cheapest tail tidy out there. Would give 5 stars if made of metal.
B00667OJA8|5|looks good and worked with my solar panel
B009RZR7Z0|5|They work great!
B0001CLFLA|5|Looked like a quality part. I ordered the wrong one though. This does not work on the GM based MerCruiser inline 6 (1971).
B008EEYWIA|5|All works nicely...very happy with product...good quality.
B004H78NQ0|5|They add the finishing touch well worth the price and were shipped fast!!!!! Well worth the price!!!
B005IM1IH4|5|Great fit
B0000AY9HO|5|Great product, locking pins are precise and smooth. I can't have a rusty old chrome ball on my new Silverado... it just won't do the truck justice. I also picked up the carrying case for the balls so they can be stored in the truck neatly to be used as required.
B008ET3BI2|5|It is a very awesome product made of vinyl, it fulfils its purpose and is very durable
B003TTL0TE|5|Worth it
B004VSEISC|5|This air freshner makes my cars smell amazing. I recommend this brand !
B00KQX5D3K|4|I was very satisfied to find this batterry available online. I called my alarm co because the sensor was continually beeping with the low batt alert. They offered to send a repair person out &#34;for free&#34;, but said the batterry would cost $50.00!!!! I'm so glad I found an alternative. The batterry was very easy to install & only took about 5 minutes. Truely pleased.
B0074FQKDA|5|It was delivered on time and very easy to install it.
B009G5FZDC|5|Fantastic. Much cheaper than even used caps om ebay. Came quickly. More Than 5 stars.
B0049HSMGE|1|Would not fit my Chevy SSR.  Had to send it back
B00CLPVHKO|5|Very bight.
B00G2586NK|4|Seem like nice filter but how do you know it is doing its job
B00XH6PPMW|5|Easy to install.  I own a 2009 klr650 with protaper 7/8 bars.  Our of the box amd on the bike no problem.  The guards look up to task with a nice heavy chunky aluminum bar from end to end.  The blue matches my bike for the most part, but really with how these bikes fade I don't care if the did it didn't to much.  Great guards for little cash.
B00VNBDWPK|5|Bought these a bit ago for my 09 impala. Man do these things make A difference. Totally worth purchasing and shipping was twice as fast as I expected. I've always purchase from opt7 and haven't been disappointed yet. Customer service is top notch, they replaced some bulb from a previous purchase of HID's as well. Won't buy from anywhere else. Can't beat the price either.
B0012Q60OG|5|An OEM Spark Plug for Toyota (The other one is the NGK). Change these out when needed and you'll have your Toyota running great forever. Gained 1-2 MPG upon replacing these in my 1997 4Runner. They came all pre gapped, but it is still good practice to check. Highly reccomend!
B00479SK66|1|it is very cheap made
B00BG9LDMS|5|Erg SuperGuard hood protector is really nice.  It was easy to install, easy to clean.  After a  23 hour road trip, the guard held up well and there was little road grime and bugs attached.  Washed up quickly and looks new. I wish I bought this brand for my other vehicle.
B005WXNMTQ|3|PROS: Covers dually very well.<br />Looks like it will hold up well. Living in southwest Florida. lots of rain and sun<br /><br />CONS: Only a antenna patch no repair patches.<br />THEY SHOW A 7 YEAR WARRANTY ON THE WEB, BUT THE WARRANTY CARD IN THE BOX SAYS 5 YEARS. Whats with that.
B0070274ZK|5|Proud to display my key chain. Love it.
B001O7PNNM|5|Used in conjunction with ultimate polish to creat a mirror shine on my rifle stock.
B000WK6GHO|1|Have to double check the hardware everytime i get on to ride, Cheap Price, cheap product
B0018ICAMO|4|Functional and well made. Just what I expected.
B000GU3EB6|5|On my early morning bike rides my eyes would always water so much I couldn't see and would be forced to stop often to wipe them. Though these may not be for bicycle riders, they sure work for me. I thoroughly enjoy wearing these with every ride. I can see!!! I may order the clear ones for cloudy days. They fit very well over my new larger-framed prescription glasses.
B008CE0FRO|5|Nice Heavy duty product
B00WTKKPZY|4|Solid product that is of good construction and aesthetics. Only gripe is that you can see more of the brackets, between the underbody frame and the board, than what the illustration makes you think. In other words, the board is not snug against the truck body like I thought. But still installs easily and works great!
B0015PRVF6|5|great headlights they work very well and look good
B00AAIDD38|4|Purchased a set of 4 size 195/65/15 for my wife's 09 Elantra.  I am sure there are better tires out there than these.  However, for &#60; $250 DELIVERED, it is hard to beat this value especially since we wont be keeping the car forever.<br /><br />I've only logged about 2500 miles, but so far-so good with regards to performance in wet & dry weather. My logic is that if Duro tires are good enough to put on motorcycles, quads & dirtbikes, they should be fine on my car.
B004UVGC7A|5|Yes, great company and the best product on the market !
B006WQSXSW|5|As described fit was excellent
B00V93AJEE|5|Delivery on time not destroyed
B001AWHTBA|5|These repair buttons work fantastic! I used a few of them to repair a large gash in my tire and along with tire Slime it sealed the leak.
B009DJWU6Q|5|High quality parts Im very happy with my purchase would recommend to anyone
B00ZOKJVAG|3|Not sure about the quality. But its work well
B00CCK8S6Y|5|never replace an oil pan without one of these
B000LDIJ72|5|I charged the battery for about 8 hours and it has been starting my 6 HP lawn mower for a month now without a hitch. One day the grass had grown quite high and the mower was stalling a lot because we were trying to cut it in one pass so as a result we used and abused the battery a lot that day. It worked admirably. It started the mower each time without a problem. It hasn't been charged since that 1st time but it is still starting the mower with ease.<br />I'll most likely edit this review at the end of the season when we've used it all summer and fall but so far, I like it a lot.
B00KFP2QQ6|5|Exactly as pictured, prompt delivery
B00HJ6O4A0|5|Material is very strong, colors are nice and super large.
B000C5DUN2|5|Was easy to install!! & works great!
B0076ATS96|3|I can't agree with other reviewers who say their reception was better than with the longer original antenna.  That is not my experience, but it's OK, and fine for the price.
B005SB6S3Y|2|The adjustability in this is lacking.
B001FCB1JG|5|Works well
B005VR6U5G|5|WORKED PERFECT FIR MY APPLICATION
B001TQMZWU|5|We bought these to double as camp chairs and rockers for our back deck that would be easily stored during the rainy season.  They are comfortable, and not too wide like some styles so don't take up a lot of room on the deck or in the car on trips.
B001PNU0Z6|5|works well and love that it is compact
B0088BX0IM|4|This power supply worked out well for me on my last road trip on my motorcycle.  It has both the vehicle outlet and the USB outlet that can be used simultaneously.  It was easy to connect to the battery, but due to the limited length of the power cord, I had to leave the plug beneath the gas tank since the battery on my bike is located under the seat. It was a good buy for me.
B00755JMYS|5|Worked very well. These bulbs use very little energy. We usually camp in a location with no electricity and run on battery power. These bulbs will operate up to three days without having to charge the battery.
B004HN2OY6|5|Awesome lift. Easy assembly. Works great
B00802GVRQ|4|Lights work great and look great. Only problem is the connector that was on the kit to fit the factory harness did not make a complete connection. I had to buy a new female connection harness from O'Riley auto parts. I then found out that the connection they provided was a cheap male connector that when you wiggled the wires going into the male connector the lights would shut off and on. Overall the lights are great just their plastic connectors are junk and caused me a lot of frustration and time to figure out what was the problem. Also the manual they provided either got submerged in water or glue because all of the pages were stuck together so if their were any installation instructions I never saw them so i was on my own for the install. And another thing that i noticed a few other customers had put when i got the box that it came it everything inside looked like it had been thrown in and crammed shut. I had feared the bulbs had been damaged but they were not thankfully.
B000CN77TW|5|Great bushings. Thanks!
B0049Z6TC0|5|Awesome!
B000C6KJYE|1|The Purolator Classic A24278 filter does NOT fit the air filter housing for 2012 Nissan Murano despite what Purolator & Amazon say. It is bot too tall and does not have the &#34;special&#34; tab needed for the Murano's filter housing.
B000H6P0A2|5|Tools like this keep me buying tools and trying to do things myself.  It brings me pleasure when the right tool makes the job at hand trivial.  This is one of those.  It's not much and maybe when I think about it, it might be a bit expensive, but my time is worth a lot to me and it's non-refundable!<br /><br />This thing just slid into the fitting and--poof--the line was separated from filter.  The other end gave me trouble but it wasn't the tool, it was the tool trying to use the tool.  There was a chunk of dried mud on the fitting.  Once I got the flashlight and looked, I stopped filling out the amazon return form, scraped off the mud, blew out the rest of the debris and--you guessed it, poof--the other end came off.
B006R61RA8|5|Perfect fit in 2003 Ram 2500, easily snaps into place! Great OEM replacement for broken or missing map light covers.
B00LKJ5W6W|1|The 3d part is peeling off after 3 days
B004J7EZNS|5|Perfect fit for 2011 Acura RL. Good, heavy construction and quality - these are great filters for the RL.
B0038AXAXI|3|NOT powerful lights
B00W2XEMT8|5|:-)
B004HCS4PK|2|With all the ads you would think this is one great synthetic wax. However, it might be good for a garaged vehicle (as would any wax) but in hot humid climates where the vehicle is stored outside it last no longer than MANY cheaper alternatives.<br />Leaves a nice initial shine but it disappears very quickly. For vehicles stored outside one might do better with a product like Finish Kare 1000. Same look but last way, way longer
B009PQCOVI|5|Worked perfectly.
B0072LDEFI|5|Yes!, we got it! Thank you so much!! We Love  our New Stubby! Antenna! It works perfectly fine!
B00GIPCX3I|5|Product is exactly as described.
B00JQYLLEU|4|I didn't need all of these but three of different ones did the job for me.
B00KY57YKA|5|Nice part
B003Z9WMWC|2|Its easy to install but not the best quality.  Mine broke in about 2 months, I don't recommend it.
B00JFCYFJ6|4|Works well.  Easy to use.
B000KPU8F2|5|Excellent jump starter.
B0006H8Q5I|5|Good price good product
B0045K2Q9Y|5|Good assortment of fuses.
B00UGGIM0I|5|Works for my car perfect
B000R5OIB0|5|Look great on the truck.  Fit just right!  Easy to install!. Price of worth it!
B001UP1F26|5|It came quick & the quality is great !  Its very good material and I was very happy !
B00K73QBKS|1|Not that it is bad product. It just simply does not work in A4. If you ever used the branded original, you know how tight the net needs to be to hold shopping bags in place. This one does not, because the net stays loose and not tight at all. Additionally the hooks are NOT the flat hooks A4 needs, but weird clams that don't really fit well the A4 hook handles. It may work for other brands, but does not work for Audi. I ended up buying just a slightly more expensive generic net and that one fits exactly.
B002QYDD3O|5|I am obsessed with these car air fresheners. Any time someone gets in my car, they ask how my car smells so good. They only sell these seasonally in stores but everyday on Amazon:)
B006D99PLC|5|I purchased this jacket to replace my old one.  After 10 years it finally wore out.  Very good value!!!  It also does a great job keeping me dry.  It's very light weight and comfortable.
B00G0ZDZJM|5|Exact match.  Very happy.
B003TTX7TA|5|These boot plugs work great!!!!
B00CQAR1OK|5|color is perfect  good quality
B00EF1ES6C|5|great product working well so far
B00P2D3W0A|5|Great product, fast shipmen great customer support
B0096BP6IK|5|They packing that goes in the area is useless!! I guess it's supposed to hold your device in place. Too big and not worth the total amount of money.
B00BRN5X6U|5|Easy to use.  Immediately stopped cargo from shifting around.
B00R6LZUW4|5|This is a great options for a bed liner.  This is the second one I've owned (previously had on for my 2003 Ford F150).  Not only is it easy on items carried in the bed, it looks great and is tough as nails.  After picking up a load of mulch from the dump, I just hosed it out and it was as good as new!
B004NDB9AK|3|I use it for small screws and hose clamps. This tool saves my a lot of time on some jobs.
B00FB3GDXE|1|Really?? All people who buy this and worse live by it should get their license revoked. You won't change tailgaters behavior by your own road rage. Yes, purposely slowing down is road rage.  Get out of the way and let the police deal with them. Seriously people, don't provoke axxholes by buying and displaying this
B003BZD03K|5|These gives 90° connections for laundry hoses, reducing stress on connections. If you have or buy hoses that already have 90° connections, a pair of these on the other end should extend your hoses' lifespan.
B00651CLCS|5|Very easy to install with a simple wrench. Radio sounds better and also don't have that annoying wind noise the factory one caused when driving. Great product
B008L1MSVY|5|Perfect gift for any Jeep lover
B004MSYQBU|5|Bearings are cheap but does the job.
B00KTIYXLU|4|Bought these for my Ford Escape. They programmed relatively easily once I got a hang of exactly what the instructions were asking. The range on mine has been great (a lot of people haven't been so lucky, apparently).<br /><br />My only gripe and the reason they didn't get five stars is the battery life; the first one already died after a few months of daily use. I'll keep better track of the second one to see how long it lasts. There's no battery access, I'm sure you could crack it open if you were inclined to do so but for the price I'll probably end up getting another set in the future.
B000GV9356|4|Sure enough, there be shims in this plastic box. If you ride 4 strokes, this box will save you money.

B0002Z9O6O|4|When product was received the rubber step cover was on backwards.  After a bit of effort I was able to fix it.  Product was easy to install in my 2014 Toyota Tacoma Double Cab hitch.  The only other issue I experienced was the the flip down step sticking down.  After a whack with a hammer I was able to return the step to its proper location.
B0002L6NQW|5|I ordered 1 each for a CRV and Scion XB and they both fit perfectly.
B00LG07MZE|3|I had to return this &#34;jumbo&#34; windshield sunshade b/c it was too small for my Honda CR-V.  The product is advertised at 33.86 inches in height, which is too short to affix under the visors of this car.  If I fiddle with it for a while I can get it to stay put, but I don't want to play around with an ill-fitted sunshade every time I park.  Part of the problem is a lack of firmness at the edges, which facilitates slippage.  My sense is 38-40 inches and more firmness would be right for the CR-V windshield.  Sellers should provide guidance regarding which vehicles the product does not fit well with.  I thought &#34;jumbo&#34; would potentially be too large for a small/medium SUV.  Wrong!  Other than size, the material is very thin.  I'm skeptical about its durability.  It's difficult to imagine it lasting 5 years with daily usage in a very sunny area.
B007TG7HGI|5|Best Blades for the money
B008RD2WWQ|5|Good product.
B000A8JLIY|5|I threw a check engine light on 2011  Hyundai Accent , misfire on cylinder #3 , bought  (4)  Delphi GN10330 Ignition Coils, and (4) NGK  BKR5EIX-11 Iridium IX Spark Plugs , I replaced all coils , plugs and it runs GREAT!
B005FN2F5U|3|The product is advertised as both front seat and rear seat covers.  I only received the front seat covers.  I am waiting to see if I receive the back seat cover, or if the seller will refund me the cost of the back seat cover.<br /><br />The front seat covers seem great.  They fit well, and don't move. They look and feel great.  They come with under the seat horizontal straps with buckles and also straps the width of the seat underneath to prevent slippage from side to side.  However, with electronic seats, it's a pain in the butt to secure them tightly.  I have tiny hands, and still received multiple cuts from rummaging under the seats with all the tracks and electronics.
B001P6GONU|4|Was surprised by the expansiveness of this briefcase. It can carry a lot and keeps everything well organized. the only negative thing I have to say is the latch behind the locking mechanism used to reset the combination was covered by the leatherette forcing me to cut a part of the lining to expose it since the precut area mean for this purpose wasn't alligned. Also, changing the combination was a bit of a hassle.
B00KYQQM5M|5|Good one
B00OJN8E5C|5|Great looks amazing
B000WJEORY|5|Nice and compact, works great so far.
B000L9T71I|5|This was the best alternative to what my Chevy dealership wanted to charge. They wanted to do it for $150 plus labor. This kit is essentially the same thing and much cheaper. Applying it is quick and simple, without a worry about thieves.
B00GSAUHB8|5|good product just as advertized
B00BD4SLV2|5|For the money, they look good and fit well.  Delivered on time and packaged well
B00T2NK2V8|5|My friends bike started to have some issues again, but this time with the carburetor. I decided to go back to this brand again and once again it outperformed my expectations. My friends bike is up and running smoothly again! Quick service, great parts, and short delivery times makes this product perfect.
B000EDST1K|5|This unit fit perfectly in our travel trailer.  It works well and is very attractive as it blends with our interior perfectly.
B005CHT4W6|5|GREAT FOR MY MAZDASPEED3. I KNOW IT'S DIESEL OIL BUT IT'S GOOD FOR MY ENGINE! SO FAR SO GOOD!
B007KA7PP6|3|Fit just right but does quite a noise?
B001EP0GMW|5|Outstanding, arrived in two days (my good buddy ordered one also and it arrived next day.) Then, we shared installation. The first one (mine) took about 45 minutes. The second one (his) took about 15 minutes. Not one bolt or hole was misaligned!  Slam dunk the best and quickest delivery<br />and installation ever. Will not shop elsewhere.
B00E1J0BGE|5|Very happy with these mats!
B00DPIFDOM|1|web page does not tell you if you get one side or even left or right so do not \buy unless you want to gamble with your money
B006R9W68W|4|The color of this rug is not exactly as pictured, the pictures are so small it compresses the weave of the rug which tightens the color. Every color is a multi colored weave. The material is plastic and it snags easily. It seems to self heal. For the price I haven't found anything better.
B007VRDRA0|5|Works just as it should.
B00HRHRPLG|5|Awesome product, no issues and looks great. I had a shop install, but only because i got an oil change too. Bright red, perfect shade of red, and kicks my Charger up a few notches. Love them.... Includes all 4, front 2are larger than backs, but that's typical. -Jim
B004D0EAUE|5|Great starter I would recommend this to anyone.  starts my truck 10x better then it use to. One turn to the key and starts right up. Now with the old starter on there and you would have to keep cranking till it turned fast enough to start
B000CO7DIQ|5|it works
B00IKSRTBM|5|The item was as described and arrived when it was supposed to.
B00TH2G1CS|3|Confusing instructions.<br />Doesn't work as it should, though it does function as an alarm.
B007I7D66S|5|Very very bright lights
B006UH9OK4|4|It fits perfectly but dosent look like a very sturdy product. Keeping my fingers crossed for it to last a long time. Very light weight and neat product.
B007IPKVLS|2|The battery will not fit a BMW R60/5. I should have checked it before filling with acid. I made it work by removing a few brackets.
B0063Z090W|5|this works great recommend for all black suede sneakers
B008CA7SKA|5|This windshield cover perfectly fits my 2011 Subaru Forrester, which has a long width.  It is a bit difficult to put back together, my husband can do it easily so it's probably just me.  I tried a few covers from Walmart and they were all horrible.  This cover is one total piece.
B002LLE1ME|5|Replaced my old non working control unit with this one and it works great.
B00QJYZIC6|1|was what i needed for my project car. Sadly the holes to connect to the battery terminals were over sized.  Also there is no room in this products design to compensate for needed adjustments.  I would have to say if i had known when i ordered them that the supplier was outside the US.  I would have made my purchase with more scrutiny.
B00NWB2LDS|5|excelente !!!!!!!!!!
B00MQ334CA|5|Worked just fine, thank you.
B00EVY2SKG|5|Nice to have around the house, or for the car
B00JRE38EA|5|Awesome product, really bright
B00IKKS4W8|4|Strong to a point but weak unless straight up and down. The do lift but not with the included crank...unless you're the hulk. I used them because my electric stabilizers bent on us the first night we used them.  They do the job even though there's other brands out there for more. I would recommend them as a substitute to the garbage electric jacks
B00LTO2ME8|1|Did not work for me after many tries at different attenpts. It has no instructions either. BMW 528, yr 2000
B000HS8PB6|4|So far so good when it comes to coverage. It seems durable and fashionable. I bought it for my Harley Davidson Softail which covers it pretty well. Just be careful not to put it on while your pipes are hot.
B002SB00QS|5|Bought it for my TRD Tundra to help with sway when towing . Have not towed yet but the ride around town improved in my opinion .
B000C2SDAK|5|It works in my 2000 BMW 740il. I was throwing a code for the Thermostat. swapped this in and the code was gone. However on a side not to all you BMW owners out there. If this needs to be replaced on your car, you better check the electrical connectors on your ECM. Some how some way our cars suck coolant from a bad thermostat up the wires and drip it onto the ECM. It sucks it through the wires like a straw some how. Seams out of this world weird but I'm telling you this is a common problem. Double check your ECM connectors. Unplug them and look for coolant. This will be an extremely costly repair if this happens. Ask me how I know! lol.
B003C01FD6|4|Good product but the wires are too small for Peg Perego Gator that I wanted to make new connections for.
B000EBKG5E|5|Bought this cushion for my van and found that it is comfortable and a Great Price!
B00KKNNZ6I|4|good material. goes on easily.
B00LOZUDA2|5|Like the look on my car. Product as described.
B00MJUU504|3|It is nice
B0085IJ6E0|4|works very nice,no trouble to connect and disconnect
B003CK3PN4|1|I bought this brand a less than a year ago and with in 6 weeks started leaking I'm an ase certified auto tech I spent to money on the tools to install correctly!!! So be warned they will leak
B008P8M5WA|5|The shield on my Bell Star helmet got broken and it broke one of the hinges with it. As the rest of the helmet was perfect it wouldn't have made sense to scrap the helmet over a part that cost a few bucks. I bought these and being original parts they replaced my broken ones perfectly. Now my helmet is as good as new again.
B00HE1BU6G|5|Exactly what I ordered. Works great. It's glass...what else is there to say about it.
B001CQWM8E|5|Very sturdy and large mirror, mounts easily. I would mount this before mounting any windshields or roofs are installed, but it is doable if they are already installed as was in my case.
B009HXNB2A|5|worked as advertised, no leaks, no problems!
B000GQA8DC|1|Cheaply made and did not meet my expectations. Returned jt
B000COMXCM|5|Excellent
B008KQLDFC|5|very well made look awesome prob wont be good in a wreck but hey, woman dig huge scars..lol
B00C5T9ZV4|1|This does not fit 2004 Chevy Silverado 5.3 L engine!
B00TF7BVWK|5|great price. works as expected
B000IZ6DOE|5|Works like a charm my car has been like an icebox on these hot days
B00192JGN0|4|Vinyl does not standup to 100+ degree direct-sunlight.  Five-star for non-direct sunlight use.  Two-star for direct-sunlight, 3pm, 100+ degree temperature use.
B00PSRORH2|5|Window shades are great.  They do a good job keeping out the sun.
B000F5DQWY|4|Very Loud... it gets your attention
B00J2RQ3UI|5|Awesome product. Thanks so much!
B00I5054M6|5|Great product installed in less than two hours just as good as the higher price blocks very good quality dose require an alignment the 2.5in blocks give you front end about Half an inch more hight than the stock rear great product
B00HNP91VO|5|Loved. It
B004960VZ0|5|Not much to say the price was right.  Upon inspecting the pads they appeared to be made well.  Installed fine on my vehicle and appear to be working fine.  No squeaking issues or grinding sounds from the pads.<br />I would by again.
B000GTXD4K|5|Love thwm only con is they are a Little small compared to my oakley's
B00138OMJI|3|These are nice, easy to use tie  downs. I have a set of these that are a different brand and they have larger hooks and a better quality rope, but these work well. The hooks are rubber coated which comes off pretty quick. Bottom line is that they function pretty well but could be better quality.
B008Y9K3YC|5|Fit the Volvo exactly.  Great buy
B00GRSOJSS|3|I was a little conflicted about how many stars to give, and I'll explain why.  If you have small parts that you can completely soak in Evaporust, it is a 5 star product.  It really works!  The rust just rinses away.  However, the instructions on the back say that if you have a larger item (mine was a cast iron dutch oven) to cover in Evaporust soaked paper towels and plastic wrap and let soak that way.  There is definitely less rust than before, but it didn't disappear the way it did on the smaller items.  There is still enough rust on it to not justify the price I paid.<br /><br />So my advice is that if you have small items that you can completely submerge, this product is great.  If you have larger items, keep searching.
B002P3U6WM|5|very nice looking i loved it. it exactly matched with the interior.
B001JT76C6|5|Worked perfect for running the power back to my reverse lights from my dash to install my back up camera.
B002XJNQSY|1|This window sticker did not stick well to the back window of my truck.<br /><br />The plastic bubbled up.<br /><br />Not a great display of my service.
B002OPZLZ8|1|Two weeks after I put this on my Volvo I had the car in for an alignment and was told the bearings in this unit were shot and would fail inspection. They showed me the excess play in the unit. Waste of time and money. Hopefully I can get my money back from Amazon. There doesnt appear to be a specified mfg. Warranty period in the item description.
B0031ZDU62|4|The little tabs to hold the wiring harness clips on were too big, had to trim the with a razor blade to make them fit. Other than that they are very good coils and work as good as OEM so far( 1 month of use in daily)
B007EA6R0Q|5|Easy to use and holds 5 bikes.  Great for a family of 8!  We will see if it holds up as long as our last one that lasted about 8 years.
B004U002J0|5|Great product. Have had these in my last 5 vehicles.
B00FFGSZF6|5|These were so bright colored I used them for decals on my Motorcycle they look amazing big enough to show off yet not so big that it over powers my bike I LOVE these I may get more for my car also thank you Amazon I love your stuff!!!!!!! I love the folks who sell good products as well
B00YME6LU8|5|The front looks nice with the white letters which will not rub off. Didn't like the white around the back so cut it off.
B005BNWET6|4|Good quality material, just a bit of adjustment and added silicone needed to fit. Seems a bit too big for application but it is the correct part number for a 1996 Toyota Camry LE
B005DM4ZXS|3|Better than advertised.  Shipped quickly. Installed easily. Love it.
B00LBUAN46|5|Great deal for quality pads. These pads are a little small but nice foam,smooth,no defects. These will work great for my automotive uses. Good delivery time.
B0010Z4MDK|5|works, just like the original I just had to use the included adapter . good thing I didnt throw the adapters away before installing. other than that  instaling the adapters just added three seconds to the aprox. 30 secopnds  it took to install the battery.
B00DJ3YS4Y|5|Wears great.
B00O3G4WSI|3|Seems like a good car trash bag.  It would have been better if they made the sides more stiff with cardboard/plastic inserts so it wouldn't collapse on itself, but it stays open if there's enough trash in it.
B00062YVIY|2|Bought for a replacement to the sending unit that went out and it lasted two months befor crapping out again...tryed to do a external ground like others had too and no luck looks like I will be buying a mechanical one next so I don't have this issue
B001B3ZVBI|5|Fast delivery, outstanding quality. Would recommend!
B007ZG98M8|5|Great product. Thank you.
B00HCPE2GY|1|I ordered this part, accordingly with the note fits in amazon, but really isn´t for my car. Suzuki Aerio SX 2005
B003YKXTSI|5|I just received my keychain knife sooner than expected which is always good. The light is bright and the knife is really sharp. To me it's pretty light weight considering it is a 7in1 multi-tool. It's very convenient to have never know when you might need it. I love it!
B00S0CML7U|3|I ordered 2 sets. They came in surprisingly quick. Easy to install. East to wire. Overall they work great. Two of them just seem to lack a bit of power compaired to the other two. And when they came in i noticed three of them are spots and one is a flood. But its hard to tell when there side by side.
B009EQDQYS|5|The best quik nano polymer spray out there!! My daily go to!!!
B000F16U1C|2|Not perfect fit. Needs to be about 3/4&#34; longer.
B0000AYECO|5|A+
B008G2TN3Y|5|Fits like OEM, no problems
B006OSNUYA|4|I went down on my Suzuki GSXR 1000 on the freeway at 85mph during rush hour traffic. It held up REALLY well. Some of the plastics came off, but I didn't get a concussion or anything. It's comfortable to wear, doesn't fog up, and it's pretty convenient being modular. I can't say that the vents do very much.<br />Would I buy this helmet again? No, I would not buy a $50 helmet again. This helmet definitely did its job and saved my life, but I am from now on going to get higher quality helmets. You only have one head, and one life. Protect it and don't try to cut corners on quality vs price.<br /><br />P.S. I just invested in a Nolan N44 helmet. It's a bit pricey, but it's an Italian made helmet so I know it's going to be good.
B000P72GGY|5|Every alignment shop needs one
B000WHACHC|5|Love it, item fit perfect into my 2015 dodge caravan 👌🏼👍🏼
B000A8MY0Q|5|this fit my 1407 carb perfectly.  I had the wrong accelerator pump in (the one for the smaller carb) and installing this one took care of the off idle flat spot that I had.
B00B1VBQRS|5|Recently used royal purple synthetic oli for first time so i thought I would give this a try.It says on an empty tank as much as possible. After you empty contents then fill up with gas. i ran a full tank down to close to Empty beFore refueling. I notice a 15% increase in fuel economy for that can. Its good to use every 10,000 miles or so. I have a 2000 truck so am trying to entend its life with royal purple oil and now max fuel system.
B0001EV2ES|4|I only wish the foot area covered the exact spot I want to step up on, or down on.
B00B87NKRY|5|Awesome tires!!!
B00EPM4FBO|1|I was given wrong information from Forever Sharp. I had to return it because it did not fit my car. I had to pay$17.00 s/h to send it back
B000XEBI9K|5|I bought this bumper bully and it arrived quickly. I have had no problems with it and I use it all the time when I go to NYC.
B00L40ZQGS|4|Worked well
B001GMFHSG|2|Wrong product in box and damaged
B001B0QB42|5|Favorite wax of all time, especially on dark or red paint. Takes minimal effort and leaves a beautiful result. Natural product. Mist a little water on the surface of the paint after waxing, and it will give off a super shine! This is not a long term wax, lasts about 8 weeks, but without all the harsh chemicals of &#34;year long&#34; waxes. Worth the effort.
B005OA0KH4|1|Could not get it to work.  Followed instructions to press button sequence 26 times and still did not work.
B006OCAP80|3|Excelente
B001F0IELG|5|This hinge kit enabled me to save 42 inches on my new pontoon boat trailer. Based on the total loaded weight on the trailer and my tongue weight, the reference guide said that I could go up to a 45 inch pivot point. This product is very well made, and I had it professionally installed by a trailer repair shop, since they had to cut into the brake lines, complicating the install.<br /><br />Without this product, I'd be renting storage space instead of putting my 31 foot long trailer in my 28 foot deep garage.
B002DZJQ0A|5|Works well!
B00G44IZEO|5|only way to mount a table to the wall in a camper.
B00MNT9Q3I|1|Do not buy this tonneau cover. It is junk!!!
B001B5DS7K|5|I have an '03 Miata.  It went in real easily and worked great.  Turns out the pilot bearing was froze which was causing the squealing noise coming from the clutch.  The new one fixed the problem and everything else is new in the clutch now!  Clutch pedal feels good with the new clutch too.
B000BHKZIE|2|I didn't get what is pictured, I received an aluminum manifold not the brass one pictured and the quick connect leaked on the first time I used it. I had to use my old connectors to get the job done.
B000EVYGZA|5|Neatly small and functions accurate.
B0013ENVJE|5|I was hesitant about getting this exhaust for my EXT 4x4 Trailblazer but it was a good choice. First off the system fits just needs about an 4 inch extender but the sound is fabulous. The trade off is the engine shakes on idle but that doesn't bother me. This is a good buy don't think about it just check it.
B00BCRMAAS|4|Not a bad product and I'm pretty sure the horrible smell will eventually go away. I will be washing this product by hand and wash machine and hang dry until the smells goes alway. What smells the most is the steering wheel. But I think we don't really need that. My most interest is the seat covers. I will update this post once I get the smell out.<br /><br />Now the product is good quality compared to the many others I have bought at the store. It is thin but I will handle with care. I have yet to try it on my car but once the smell is out I promise to come back and let you know how it went.<br /><br />The colors are very nice I love the colors and how it looks. It came in a nice bag and well packed. Everyone answered my question that it is easy to install I will come back to let you know once it is installed. Other than the smell I really like it.<br /><br />I recieved this product to sample review and give you my own honest opinion.
B00EUIDPLO|5|I was so happy to find a metal Ohio State license plate that had cut outs for the stickers we have to use here in Ohio! :) Seems to be good quality!
B0007TR4CQ|5|worth the money last forever
B009T9O99G|5|Great product! This is the product the professional detailers use. Once applied it will last up to one year depending on your climate.<br /><br />You need to take care when applying, a little goes a long way.  Well worth the extra steps compare to ordinary wax!<br /><br />Here's a link on how to apply this product: http://www.detailedimage.com/Ask-a-Pro/klasse-high-gloss-sealant-glaze-ksg-guide-and-review/
B006ZVL6CY|5|No issues, works and fits well
B000VAFN60|5|Not what I expected
B007I3ALWY|5|Great fit.. Love them
B0010G9KUO|5|Exact fit for H2 Hummer.  Motor was smooth and quiet.  Would buy this again compared what the dealer wanted.
B00JEUHSXY|5|these do a great job of keeping the sand contained, it does not get into my carpet.
B004K25GMQ|5|Exactly as described. Hold Windows nicely along with full soft top.  Can be used to just hold Windows as well. Very well made.
B00FFEWJUK|5|Great fit
B0082OYG3I|5|it does the job for that little bad ass demon
B007KCZRC2|5|Great light, fast delivery
B00LHNUZWW|4|would be 5 stars if the screws were black... the silver stands out and makes it look bad
B001RBBMNA|5|looks great
B000C71LL8|4|Worked fine, didn't include the low fluid sensor that was shown in the picture. I was able to reuse the old one so I didn't care too much.
B00BITLTK2|1|After installing this unit did not work. After removing it, I noticed that the head of the shaft was too small to close the hole and regulate the idle.  Even though it was a lot of trouble to take the part out and buy a local correct replacement, after contacting Amazon, they gave me my money back and a credit towards buying some more products on their automotive website.  I did that by buying some products that were well known brands.  The two items I purchased were from PT Auto Warehouse and were both made in China.  Junk!  Amazon customer service was great! Even though the people I talked to were in Costa Rica.
B000NCOKZQ|5|The item was as described and arrived when it was supposed to.
B00Y6CCAOC|5|Mounts are adjustable and are easy to adjust. Light is really bright. Haven't had any problems with this light and it has been on my truck for about a month.
B00AIJY2ZM|5|Yes, yes, yes, buy this for your license plate light(s).  As long as trigger-happy cops like to use an tiny insignificant violation like a burned out license plate light to pull you over for no real reason, it pays to virtually eliminate the risk altogether even at $10 a pop.  Sylvania is the real deal.  Don't trust the off-brands if you don't want trouble.
B00BR3UWXY|5|Works perfect
B00557QI0Y|5|I used this part for a quick, painless repair of a failed rear windshield wiper motor.  The part was a perfect fit and is working just as advertised.
B006VFR2LS|5|Nice quick detach mount. Wife said too expensive. I said imagine your ass upside down headed for a bbq. She likes them.
B00MY3X0QM|4|It gets me more height so i can wash the top of my Rogue comfortably.
B00O3GYZUI|5|These don't get really blindinlg bright. But are a great replacement for the OEM yellowish bulbs and perfect price point.
B002PQMNM0|5|Looks factory
B007KPRWAY|5|Comes with everything you need to rebuild your forks. Great kit
B000765MHI|5|This is only day 1 with the fan, but it so much better than yesterday @ 105°.  The cab of this truck is now nice and cool.  Thanks.
B001QXRPUI|5|This product cleaned up my leather flats very nicely.
B0016HNQ84|5|Arrived on time, fit and worked perfectly. Plus, I saved a bunch of money.
B001O156W6|5|I'm a retired mechanic and these are good struts and were easy to install, should be no problem even for the average jo.
B005C57JF2|5|works as intended and as good as original
B009B9KZ3I|5|Works great
B009X23B2U|5|Fit great and looks great on my Jeep!
B004BU5WHG|5|i had a 10 year old one when i was rear ended on the 101 freeway...  not a scratch on my Tahoe but unfortunately my step was wrecked...<br />couldn't order this fast enough...  and the quality and new style of this one is fabulous...!
B00157TGXY|4|Work much better than the powder I was using.  Seems to be effective.
B00DMPQYHI|5|It's Real!!!!!
B001U04MPS|5|This is a great charger that performs beyond my expectations. I am using it as a powerwheel charger for a 4 and 3 yr old. combined with a Battery Tender Ring Terminal, this is a simple way for the kids to charge their own toys. When they are done after 3+ hrs of riding they know to plug it up and let it charge. It only takes 30 mins!!!!!
B000VKTUE6|5|Good Product
B0060BR7FO|5|very good
B008BE04C6|5|Used these in my HHR. Awsome light.Very nice field of light.
B00D329B8Y|5|I've been wanting to get new floor mats for my '02 Honda Civic but I've been putting it off... But I finally got these! And these appear to be really heavy duty! And HEAVY!!! These have lots of grooves to help get some of that crap that's been trapped in the sole of your shoes more... And should be easier to clean and hose off than the carpet mats I used to have. I live on a dirt road and my carpet floor mats were constantly dirty! I got this item at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review. These are worth its regular price!
B000CPJMD4|1|Despite checking to see if they would fit my 2012 Dodge Van, they WOULD NOT fit, and I had to send them back. Superior should do a better job of marketing the right product for the right vehicle.
B008G23KRY|4|These are going on a 1986 F150 that I've decided I'm keeping since I've had it for over 20 years. TIme to dress it up and repair some of the worn items. Then in the shop for a new paint job.
B00138OMJI|5|the best I have had
B00HYHX8E2|5|Perfect fit for my 2015 Ford Escape.  I got the black because a reviewer of the tan ones said the color was off.  I have the light stone interior and the black looks great.
B000GU58Q0|5|A1A
B002YKETS8|5|Works great on out '09 Camry - not much more to say.
B005OUK0JC|5|These look great, are very clear, and sure to generate conversations everywhere I go. Now if I could only ride like Ronnie Mac!
B000COB5MQ|5|Still using it
B000GVECD4|5|Didn't realize this was a dirt bike chain till I got it.  Installed it on a street bike, so far so good.
B00CS9CO6Y|5|Worked very well for carrying lightweight items that are too bulky to fit inside the car.
B00LOJTBLA|5|These 3 watt Cree LED lights are very bright. They work wonderfully as DRLs on my Genuine scooter. I recommend these lights and the company is very responsive to warranty requests.
B00OK6N7OG|5|My son, the blacksmith, loves it.
B00292H6VI|5|Makes my car look newer. Happy with my purchase!
B00OB2L3M2|3|Did not  comes  with  any information  about  how to  /instructions
B00S7NX0RW|5|These arrived today and I immediately put them in my 2014 Patriot. Absolutely perfect fit and for the price and quality you can't beat it. You're a fool if you want to spend $50-$100 more on another brand. I'm looking forward to the bad weather now just to put these to full use. Get them.
B00FGEUS2K|5|Lets the goat pokers know exactly where you stand.
B007Y58GCS|5|Perfect fit
B006WQRCT8|1|Bought one six months ago went bad already made noise from the beginning I called the customer service line at Detroit axle and they said they don't cover bearing failure under the one year warranty my question is what do they cover then will not buy another
B006FINVQ6|5|Great bulbs.  replaced vanity lights in motorhome.  These had higher lumens rating than those at camping world and much better value.
B00EBK63SS|5|Great helmet for the price very comfortable and awesome chin strap design will definitely recommend. ....
B00Q4D7HTO|1|Filter will not fit. Length is 2 inches to long. Intake ID 1/8 inch to small. A WAIST OF YOUR MONEY!!!
B005G21JP2|5|The Motor Replacement Kit for motorhome steps worked right as soon as I installed it.  Super!
B00V2BYBDS|4|It does a great job
B00BCRMBSO|1|I didnt like them. The material is very ugly looks and feels like foam.
B0009H52BG|5|no problems
B004K9JUSA|5|Installed easily and arrived quickly.
B00ELJLU3W|1|This mat is too small to serve any real purpose.
B00U0H0LHU|5|Very nice....really stands out on my mercedes
B00AKXHADM|3|Product looks nice and installed fine. My only complaint is that the LED's are much to dim for daylight use. Works fine for night/dusk use.
B003BZCZZE|3|These seem well built, but I musta missed the description that had an auto shut-off feature.
B004RDNOTA|5|I ordered 2 of these for my rear hatch on my 2005 Toyota Sienna. I wish I had ordered these as soon as I noticed my hatch door was falling shut. These work much better than the OEM factory versions. I recently moved to a region that has more than one seasons, and once I get into the cold season, I'll let you know if it continues to work well.
B009OBVRY4|5|I had a chance to put it to the test today with a scratch from rear to front on my car. I used a Meguiars compound and it did not work first because scratch was too deep, I had to wet sand it with a 2000 sand paper and then polish. Results are shown on pictures, a pro result. Followed by polish and liquid wax
B0040CW2A0|5|Very good deal
B00UITXKFK|5|Great product, but my high beam and low beans are swapped and I can't switch them to normal
B000BQR8TE|5|Exactly what I needed
B002S3Y0SU|5|good to have
B009EYSMJY|5|Fits my 2004 Honda Civic fine and so far they are holding up nicely
B003QLMLPC|5|I have a 1997 24' pontoon boat that the previous owner didn't really keep nice.  I tried every chemical and cleaner in the market to try to make the white vinyl look good.  Finally I decided to use this paint.<br />With the combination of cleaning, using the vinyl prep, and the spray paint, my boat looks 15 years newer!  Took me 11 cans of paint, 2 cans of vinyl prep, 4 rolls of wide masking tape, 14 days (a few hours a day) and I have an awesomely clean new looking boat.<br />This stuff is very easy to use, even if you spray a little too much, it doesn't run, it soaks into the vinyl.  It's flexible like they say and doesn't work like you think a spray paint works.  I would recommend this product to any boater, or anyone that wants to paint vinyl.  I love it!
B005345DBY|5|Perfect fit.  Warm.
B009YR00L4|5|Worked perfectly to string up some lights when i proposed.  A little heavy so you wouldn't want to pack it around but it works well
B000C9OI1G|5|You can't go wrong buying AC Delco parts for your GM vehicle
B008NDGSHA|1|Total crap, dont waste your time.
B0075E3WZO|4|A bit awkward but it does fit and does provide some convenient storage.
B0040MGZV2|5|AS ADVERTISED
B0009V1WXE|2|No rubber smell, no concern over the lame holder.<br />Problems with double hooks- didn't fit all the different grommets I have and the coating is brittle and broke off<br />after only a couple of uses. The exposed rough metal grinds the grommets.<br />Will try to Plasti-dip them.
B00W5MG8XY|4|Was getting frustrated with low tire pressure warning light was constantly turning on.<br />Have used a standard tire pressure gauge to check pressure for many years.<br />This baby indicated that they were low by almost 8psi.<br />Inflated tires to pressure shown on this gauge and so far no more warning lights.<br />Only con is the test orifice is plastic vs. metal. Hope it holds up in the long run!
B00MDEG4WO|2|Ineffective
B00ILINN20|5|Great accessory,  must have
B000C7YQ2Y|3|made cheap
B00A9WJAA0|1|I had to order two to get one it fit the second one I will not buy thing off him I ask where it was he just said it shipped old well
B006DY2Z9G|5|Bought a 2011, Ford, Taurus, SEL with 36,000 mi.  The car came equipped OE, with this model pad.  I've 90k on the car now,  drive 77 miles to work in the Midwest but have lived also on the east coast,  lots of stop and go.  Pads have held up great.  There is still plenty of life left in these; however I can't say the same for the matching front rotors.  Slight breaking issues at 62,000 when I had them turned I was experiencing some vibration during hard stops.  Turning the rotors worked until about 82,000 miles when the problem returned, and to a similar degree and scope as the original problem that caused me to have them turned.  Despite the problems I'll be buying these pads and the matching Motorcraft rotors.  I'm overall very pleased with the performance of these products.<br /><br />I've done a lot of research trying to decide weather or not to purchase something with better specs.  Comparing pads and rotors is not easygoing.  There isn't much evidence based information that could help a buyer make an informed decision.  Reviews are sparse and people tend to only write reviews after having a pad/rotors for a few months.<br /><br />I'll stick with the devil I know vice the one I know not of.
B002UC2R8O|5|Nice replacement
B0012TWTUM|5|Looks good on the bike
B002W62ONQ|1|Junk
B000SOFLHK|5|Great product
B00IO4GZ3K|3|Decent for the money. However note that the red basically ends up a pink color and I doubt you could actually use it to tow.
B006TMLUVQ|5|Perfect match, super quick delivery and extremely easy to install. Saved a lot of money doing the replacement myself.
B008L63ZKW|3|Bows are cute and looks great on my car, BUT they didn't come with instructions to apply them. I had to go to the website for the instructions, which weren't even clear. It was difficult to put on and took a long time, but was worth it in the end.
B006CRT72W|1|Never worked ! Cheap and waste of money !
B004BCJBKS|5|Bought for relative.  No known problems.
B000RFUF12|5|Works well and dosen't overfill batteries
B003F06Y34|5|I have bought 4 bottles of this cleaner and cleans it does.<br />Miracle worker.  It is like magic. No scrubbing. I luv it.<br />Can use it on so many things. I highly recommend it.
B002L9YBSU|4|Quality is great but it would be better If it was exact sizes
B0066IU9B0|5|Good good
B0002JM8PY|5|Great for smoothing miters on painted woodwork.
B000C2WF9A|5|Fit good on my 06 Commandeer. Now they can't steal my gas. Lol
B00BH0GE02|1|Did not work wrong part
B00BV6V22C|4|It is what it is
B00AFDMV04|5|Fits perfectly. Great quality.
B003BSB7PU|4|I found these to be a very good odor eliminator for grey water. Not perfect, but I don't think a perfect solution exists. These last longer than the liquid I've used and the smell is nice.
B00E8CV0EQ|4|Got this b/c of all the kids left in hot cars here in AZ. Seems a little small, but I've put one in each car which I hope to never use.
B003E2WQE4|5|Works great for our 150 Honda.  Didn't come with instructions, but it wasn't too hard to figure out.
B00E0CSN5I|5|It work  Great and easy to use.save  lots of money🚚
B00B9ZKCTO|5|Eazy to install. Looks great!
B001TAPLYA|4|Had minor issue getting one blinker to work properly. Notified seller and they responded promptly. However in the interim my mechanic realized that the one light had not been assembled correctly (minor wiring issue)and was a relatively easy fix.they work fine and looks great
B000FW2MWW|5|looks good and worked with my solar panel
B006B376WK|5|It works.
B000COSAMY|3|I bought at local parts store @$26.  I was too impatient to wait for shipping.  Despite the picture, this model number shock has the stem mount on top for front of my 93 toyota pickup.  I had a blown shock so these helped quite a bit.  I do have some heavier mud tires on the truck so could get a better ride with more expensive and stiffer shocks, but these stopped most the bouncing.  I wouldn't rave about them like some have on here.  These ride fine, but I would prefer a tight and constant tire contact with the road with my heavier truck style tires.  An improvement over junk, and a cheap fix.  A great price here on amazon, but pretty much your average shock and nothing special if you're looking for performance.
B0052SF0LO|1|I ORDERED 2W OF THESE ANO ONLY ONE WORKS PROPERLY
B009FUF6DM|1|I truly wish I could give them less than 1 star. I have owned these towels for 1 day. I used them to dry my car after a wash. Since they had a little dirt and I have OCD I threw them all in the wash on a light rinse cycle.  EVERY SINGLE TOWEL IS  DESTROYED!  The seams came apart and my ENTIRE washing machine is full of lint! I even the ones that never touched the car, so it's not like the products that I used on the car could have affected the towels!  How is this ok?  How did anyone give this anything more than a single star?  I can't understand how Amazon thinks it's ok to sell these!
B0092776W2|5|hard to put it on
B00GZLMEN4|4|Excellent product and works great, but works even better when using the Back to Black Heavy Duty Trim Cleaner first and then using this after. Your Bumpers and Trim will look new & mine were neglected for nearly 10 years! A must with the fore mentioned product for heavy oxidation and build up, you'll want the Trim Cleaner 1st. This product is a restorer and not as much if a cleaner.
B001GGB5II|5|Beautiful fairy. Looks nice on my jetski hull
B00ISBNFO6|5|Fit my acura rsx great. Easy to install. No problems
B0039KQOBW|5|Perfect
B00843V6KI|5|Way cheaper than buying the same helmet from Walmart and it feels like good quality.  It did get very hot and my hair was drenched with sweat at the end of the day though.
B000XJRYQ6|4|The stuff works! Too bad the kit I received wasn't fresh.
B001JT97C8|5|GREAT PRODUCT FAST SHIPPING 5 STAR QUALITY
B000SBCHCA|5|Very handy to read your obdll.
B00NWGZ3A6|4|Even though on volt mode it randomly displays numbers, The multimeter works when you test something useful like a battery. Worth the money though.
B004VRLGU6|1|i mean its ok .. once i hve decided to sent back. the smell is weared .
B00317DC18|5|Sounds amazing! Adds power and loses weight. I bought the quiet insert too and it makes the volume perfect
B003B44C6U|5|Worked perfectly on a 6 hour car trip there and back. Put it on a small Nissan Versa hatchback with no roof rack and drove at 80mph+. We even went through some light rain. No problems whatsoever. Saved us from having to rent a bigger vehicle for a week long camping trip.
B00PRG3JXM|5|GO TIGERS - good size and color - we love Clemson, so you can't say anything but GREAT!!!!!
B001KOKTGK|5|Looks and Works great on Vulcan 800. You might need to lengthen the wires by splicing.  Solder and heat shrink the connections.  It's best to solder the spade connectors instead of crimping them. I didn't need the adapter.
B007PVIARW|5|Absolutely perfect fit for 2016 CX-5.<br />Buy one.
B000BZJD9I|5|This is the pump you need for a '94 Caravan.  Do not buy the Shepherd Auto Parts version (if still available) as it is NOT the correct item (it is not wired properly).
B0015PK3AG|4|Works great and allows me to do my own oil changes on my Toyota Camry.
B00N7KNIX6|5|Very cute, but smaller than I thought.
B00HVRH0NK|5|Awesome - sexy, cool, and smart!
B0016IT3X0|4|Exact same part as dealer and OEM.  Easy install and works perfectly!!!  I gave 4 stars because the wheel was cracked from shipping, not Amazon's fault but the manufacture's.  I reused my old wheel.  Oh, and it was made in Canada just like my original.
B00DQ2IGE6|5|Good quality,plus the neo chrome goes good with my white enkeis
B000EFILQ6|5|exactly as described and great deal thanks
B00YXDJVGE|1|The left grip slides on and off without any resistance at all. Needed silicone adhesive to really attach it to the handlebars but with the way the grips are designed there isn't much surface for the adhesive to bond to. The right side throttle grip actually slid off the throttle cable tube, there was very little cheap glue holding it in place. Had to re-adhesive that as well.      Update: The throttle assist on the right side fell off yesterday while riding. All the screws had vibrated out, the last one popped out at an intersection. The left hand grip does not have enough inner surface area to grip the handlebars, and slowly slides off as I ride. I'm going to be replacing these ASAP. Wouldn't buy again.
B0093XLE82|5|GOODS
B0009JKI5Y|5|They work perfectly and were easy to install.  Cheaper and more convenient than going out to buy them at a store.
B00VNBEJ1G|5|I installed these bulbs into a 1968 Ford F250. They plugged right into the existing harness. The difference was night and day. The old halogen sealed beams were like lanterns in the dark. These LEDs are a whole other story. Installed into IPCW CWC-7006 7&#34; housings, the light from these LED headlights is incredible. The look at night is very nice as well and have already gotten a number of compliments. Most people don't really expect a nearly 50 year old truck to put out light that puts most modern cars to shame. I highly recommend these bulbs.
B000CHMMJS|5|Difference is night and day. No more rattling coming from the pulleys and smooth shifts and engine revs. This is the original factory part used by Hondas for their models. If you're looking for a reliable replacement for a work tensioner or pulley bearing, this is your product.
B00M9MH85W|5|Good feel and hands don't get so tired when riding
B00SBZAG5U|5|Classy, well-constructed license plate frame that comes with tamper-proof screw covers for great security.
B000BYENXK|5|Great parts<br />Thanks
B00M78820I|5|Great product.  Large enough for my SUV windshield.  Folds down so it is easy to store.  Arrived on time and good communication from the seller so you know when to expect it.
B00DSL8ZGO|2|Here's Why...<br />1st reason, after installing and testing, I discovered the control box can not be mounted inside the car due to the limited length of the wire.<br />2nd reason, the control box has no button to operate it so if you loose the remote, you're pooched.<br />3rd and most important reason, the kit has no memory function for color or pattern, once turned off (even by remote) it resets to demo mode every time.<br />Note: almost all KR kits sold on amazon seem to share the same control box limitations (no buttons on the box to control it with no remote)<br />But, the flash patterns are cool, and the colors are nice
B00ZR55A0I|5|The Power Inverter is phenomenal!  The inverter allows a user to add 2 USB slots to charge your devices as well as a Wall plug to charge any other device that you want. The best thing about the power inverter is that it doesn't take away a car power slot away as the inverter has one included as well.<br /><br />The inverter was able to charge both my phone and tablet in about an hour or so. Which is great! The inverter did not get too hot which was a real concern of mine. I am glad to know that the inverter stayed cool the whole time that I used the inverter.<br /><br />The inverter does produce a low whine, which I expected, because it is an inverter. I was glad to know the whine is barely audible when I listen closely and can't be heard when driving.<br /><br />The construction of the Power Inverter is great. I felt that it was very solid and was also able to handle a fall.<br /><br />You will be very happy with the power inverter and I recommend it.
B0007XU4EC|5|Easy to install, took care of the problem. water heater starts right up now and stays lit. received in two days as promised. price was a lot cheaper than the RV Parts Dealer .
B000BZG5ZI|5|As pictured and was here fast.<br />cured my check engine light.
B00G620ZVU|4|Impulse buy, Very bright but havent found a use for them yet.
B003JIMN0U|5|Exceeded expectations
B00LMQ228Y|5|Arrived on time and part fits correctly
B00Z7ZB3AE|2|PUMP WORKED GOOD BUT LEAKED.  HAD TO RETURN AT MY COST
B005XC0HTE|5|This was a bit smaller than I anticipated, but it is just perfect on a back side window of my new car. Easy to install, and I love the statement.
B00RUE0ULI|1|They are OK but they don't tight in very well the screws could be better quality and the curved washers were so cheap
B00NM1XL0K|4|If you have a 2011+ Silverado chances are that the reverse bulbs are size 921 NOT 3157 like the ones which came with my kit. All of the other bulbs worked just fine and look amazing. The kit should either include both types of reverse lights OR only the correct 921 size. Yes the company will send you the correct ones but they should know the difference for the 2011+ model.
B00A192QT8|3|Significantly cheaper than local auto parts store.  Significantly lighter, softer, less rigid.  My previous hose prevented my air filter from bouncing around.  This one, not so much. Would purchase again.
B003BVK85C|5|This inner dome worked great in our pull-behind campers shower. It was just a tad narrower than the original one but didn't cause a problem during the mounting procedure. I especially liked the small divots located in the flange for drilling the holes, and keeping the screw heads symmetrical . The dome kind of felt thin and flimsy to me at first glance but after drilling the holes in it I realized it was a pretty durable material. I am very satisfied and would recommend this product.
B00C5T2W9G|5|Great. Just what I needed so I can use the trailer again.
B0041DX82Y|5|Very happy with purchase, it was delivered quick and the product exactly as advertised!
B000E7D29A|5|good
B00MLO3S52|4|My husband is an ironworker, who works outside all winter, in the heart of Boston! He has been looking for a partial face mask, neck warmer and ear warmer, and typically we need to buy 2-3 different pieces to get it all covered.  I was thrilled to be able to have him sample this mask at a discount in exchange for an honest review.<br />The face part is the only part that is neoprene, which is perfect.  The neck and up to the ears is a warm, soft, fleece-like material, which will keep him warm, but allow the area to breathe. Speaking of breathing, there are vents in the neoprene face to allow for ventilation.  The whole piece is very lightweight.<br />The only reason I could not give this 5 stars is because it is August, and we are in Boston! I won't know for a few months how this will hold up in the winter, but I will come back and update at that point.  Should this be as warm as we think it will be, we will be purchasing more!
B00H03GBSA|5|Great decal. Good price.
B0046EPNN0|5|These are loud, almost scared its gonna get me pulled over. Nice rumble to them, one thing I was etchy on was nowhere in the box or instructions or pipes does it say LA Chopper brand, instead instructions say Baron Nasty Boys Exhaust. Maybe they are same company I don't know but they do sound awesome enough to not care.
B00E58J8GK|5|99 tj, My horn didn't work but airbag light not on. Only part of the wires had severed in clockspring. Don't go through chain auto shops because they will charge 190+.... same part they recommend, works perfectly. Highly recommended.
B00029JMJY|5|This product came in really fast and worked perfect
B00M7M4KE6|5|i loved
B00PBO0Z3M|5|These arrived very fast! They look great, it makes the truck look a million times better! I read a few reviews that said they leak, I plan on running them through a car wash soon so I'll test them then and update my review.
B000FFCZGM|5|This cover is awesome. Great value for the money. Very sturdy and keeps my cargo dry. Installed it myself in about 20 minutes. Easy to open and reclose. I like how I can roll it up out of he way when I need to haul large items. This model is a perfect fit for my 2005 F-150 5 1/2' bed pick up.
B00DJ5KEF4|5|Far better than the cheap (but comparably priced) POS I got from Cycle Gear.
B00MG2PP46|5|good quality & just like the picture
B005WXDPRA|1|Product has the 7 years warranty, but it has been use around year and has workmanship issue.  Amazon customer service does not want to respond and let customer contact manufacture.  During conversation with customer service the phone call dropped and no one calls back, and chat with customer service and end the session with request talk to supervisor.  COMPLETELY DO NOT SATISFY THEIR SERVICE and DO NOT RECOMMEND AND ANY.
B00CIWPAEE|5|Very happy and saved lots of money doing it myself.  Saved over  $500 replacing it myself instead of body shop. They did very well on color match.
B00N16F3ES|4|Fit great, use caution installing, the grippies on the bottom are sharp!
B009EUBS5I|5|I am happy with my recent purchase of the motorcycle exploding skull tank pad protector, it matches the color of my motorcycle and was easy to install on my gas tank.
B006P885K8|5|do you want skeleton hands cupping your breast? THEN THESE ARE THE PATCHES FOR YOU!
B0002SRCMO|5|Glad I bought this along with those fasteners.
B000F3RYGA|4|Appears to be strong and will be better tested after being in the weather for many months
B00ORCF01Q|5|Sticker lookes great on my window. Mean and nasty
B00SLLBBX0|5|Sometimes you will need to buy whole dryer if bolt doesn't come out.  But it did and worked great
B0068EQ6Y6|5|fit the 4tec engine perfectly.
B004QEQJI8|5|Works perfectly, and the lifetime warranty is a plus.
B00BGR204A|3|They cover Obama or Hilary bumper stickers quite well. Might need to reorder before next November.
B00BLKXW6M|4|great product
B002RSIK4G|5|We ordered this product to fix some gashes in the polycarbonate roof of our car wash. we applied it last week and so far this week of frequent rain our building interior is dry, saving us a lot of money on burned out electrical boxes and equipment.
B008QW8X26|5|First gear is one of the better suppliers. Check sleeve adjustability.
B000CLHC80|5|So far so good. Easy install on my 2010 Honda fit. Replaced old worn pads, didnt have to touch the rotors aince no signa of warping or excessive wear. No issues and no noise. Brakes well. Would buy again for general application.<br /><br />Let's see how well these wear, my stock ones lasted a hair over 100k miles.
B00B9APV9A|5|A1A
B000VWNAJ0|5|Exacted what I needed to control a motorized, reversible accessory. Seems to have serious quality and should last a long time.
B00AM3GHMU|5|Bought for relative.  No known problems.
B00KZJQ2L2|5|Perfect! I have a 2014 Chev Silverado truck and it fits perfect!. It so light weight I bet it doesn't weigh a pound. Very easy to use. I recommend  this sunshade to everybody. The company even sent me directions, with pictures, on how to fold it up and put it back in the bag.
B00L883AIC|5|Excellent product. I went online at You Tube and was able to replace a cracked key fob case in about twenty to thirty minutes.  Take your time and follow the videos so the mother board isn't destroyed.<br />The only suggestion I would make is to go ahead and replace the batteries at the same time the case is replaced. For under $20, I essentially have a perfectly working, rebuilt remote that works perfectly.
B00GOJ1FXM|5|FITS PERFECT ON MY 150 CC JONWAY GY6
B0044AS8IS|5|Easy to install..Good price.
B00DB8POQ8|1|There is nowhere on my 2007 ranger for this thing to mount to.
B008TNNIN6|5|well built and indicates 450lb capable on the box.<br />matco sells same one with their name on it for twice as much.<br />It is heavier than normal ones though.
B005MVBFM4|1|bought one from the matco tool truck and had problems out the gate. I filled the reservoir and  the unit was pushing air in to the system after just 1/2qt. and after paying 600$ I was pissed. found a pin hole in the aluminum tube took 5 weeks to hear back from mightyvac told them to shove it.
B007D5UXIO|1|Product does not work at all. And then they expect the customer to pay for return shipping. Pretty good rip off! Purchased the stator, CDI, this coil and none of them worked properly!!!!! Don't waste your money because they sure will!!!!!!!
B008YFHKYM|5|this stuff is a must have for diesel owners.  this ethanol is going to destroy our engines without the help of these types of products.
B00HVHDS8G|5|Great protection foe my key
B00VS0T7IC|5|Nice tire gauge, very well made with accurate measurements.
B007P74EQ2|4|Not a bad price for the whole kit, it comes with the head bolts and a couple of items not pictured, like the EGR valve gasket, throttle body gasket, and the thermostat housing to head seal
B000CPI6VI|4|works as advertised.  JUst fine
B00V7Y3AOQ|1|Broke mine within the first 3 minutes!
B00GT27FG0|5|It's a little smaller than the original part on my BMW 325i e90, which is good because it's really cramped in there.
B000O80B5M|5|Easy to read, easy to aim!  No issues with it after a few weeks.  Way better than the old ThermoHawk I replaced with it.  I'd recommend this model to my friends if they needed a tool like this.
B00CPL8PSG|5|love this product ,I have bmw 328 with 110,000. m. bmw 540 with 140,000.put the jectron in both and they run very smooth.but you need to add the lubro oil additive to the engine then you really will feel & hear how smooth the engine runs.I love lubro molly products.
B00AZ68BVY|5|These did there job and dropped my car 2 inches maybe a bit more. The ride was kinda a rough ride but what to expect when just using springs!
B000EG6CS4|5|I've been using it in all types of vehicles and any I have owned since it was first advertised on an infomercial in the 80s and have noticed the engine runs cooler than normal, mpg increases 2%. I have also used it as a bearing lube. I had an old Volvo with over 200,000 miles on it, that when using it one day the head gasket seal failed and oil and water ( coolant) leaked out. I was able to drive another 10 mi to get back home without it overheating or seizing. I , never the less, junked that car because it was not worth the gasket repair costs. I always add this to every other oil change in all of my vehicles. Great stuff!
B00RW3EEZU|5|Man this thing looks GROOVY !!!
B009FC8C5Y|5|Bought this for my sons 98 Jeep Wrangler TJ, It looks fantastic, the fit was perfect!!
B000QQD7NK|5|So far so good. I mounted this on my 91 Nissan Pathfinder with a VG30 V6 that a did a manual 5 speed swap on. No issues so far. Drives nice. No clutch chatter or slipping.
B00498CX2M|5|Good quality fuel line. Used to replace on my seadoo.
B0024GIWDK|3|It was just a bit too Mushroom for me.
B00S0CML7U|5|These are great
B00UM2EZVG|5|The perfect edition to my new car :-) I love it
B00M9ZH6VK|1|Same as the other guy.  Clean bike, area wiped down with alcohol and the sticker was peeling the next day.  Don't waste your money.
B00MYF43RK|5|Just as described,
B009AE5CNW|5|Exactly what I needed for a 1992 Toyota pickup
B00AC6TZJ4|5|96 hp and 100 ftlb tq on the dyno in a 2013 fatbob with a 103 , stock otherwise except for exhaust and race tuner
B003MQ89X4|2|Wont connect to ECU on 1996 Dodge
B004JVHWO8|5|The item was as described and arrived when it was supposed to.
B00THP4BYK|5|Best set of plastics for my 125cc pit bike ever
B00IGH1JF4|5|Great to see a nice service like engraving.
B002ERBNCG|5|I could not be happier! It was perfect!
B00NGOVF3I|5|Fits perfect cant tell its not original.
B00SR7DEGU|5|Very nice set would recommend
B00ZYI1WPA|4|Little small but great gloves
B00J4PLPT2|5|Perfect and on time
B00HG8VD6Y|5|Very nice item sticks very well
B00N27GAIO|5|I just installed this light on my truck.  Nicely priced for having so many LED's.  It is very easy to use and I even hard wired it into my truck.  The lights are bright and the variety of patterns are nice as well.  For the money I think it is a great lightbar and worth every penny.  Why spend 4 times as much...  I recommend this product...
B00CVVUQ50|5|Arrived on time and gives my BMW a great personal touch
B000066OC7|1|No support to speak of.  The foam is not dense enough.
B0002Q80RW|5|exactly what I expected
B00CZG6WO0|5|These are a perfect replacement for the original fixtures.<br />ordered 6 more. So far no issues
B000FPZXW0|5|great product
B000XBBISO|5|Fit perfectly works as advertised.
B00EFDVVV0|5|work like a charm
B000E0P6UK|3|Does a good job, but ripped the first time I used it on the edge
B003U7UR3A|5|Works great !!!! I put it in the window of my 25' x 30' storage building and connected 2 of those Harbor Fright solar panels (30 watts) directly to it. I did not use all 3 of the H.F. kit panels, because it seamed to be a bit to much power and it works well with just the two. So it only runs when the sun is shining.
B00DMIDUUY|5|Good stuff every time
B00C0SNKOI|5|Easy to locate what I need through Amazon, works fine, no problems in shipping with everything thing I have bought!
B000VKRQH4|4|Well priced and cheaper than getting one at the oil change place. They charge you and arm and leg for something that is so much cheaper online. I have a 2005 Saturn Vue and it is very easy to install and I am a woman:)
B00IT87MXS|5|Fits great
B000IYLZDO|5|Worked like a charm to quite simply restore my cruise control.
B00H3PEPH4|1|worked for only 10 days only and then it stopped working it was burned
B000RPG0DO|5|Great product. Easy to cut and works good. I used it to go under the sest on my side by side to cut<br />Down on noise and heat.
B00BITJ78I|5|Works very good
B00852684M|4|look cool at night and improves safety.
B004I13LP8|4|Same as another review: my mechanic ended up not using the housing that came with the lamp.  He removed the lamp itself and used the original housing.  Appears bright.  The lens was cracked in the original light.  Great value replacement.
B002E1AYTU|1|This item is yet another piece of Chinese garbage.  Bought this item, attached the wheels, which have countersunk holes for the nuts. Included are caps for the countersunk holes.  The caps fall out as soon as unit is lifted , figured no big deal I can fill the holes with foam. Proceeded to do an oil change on a work vehicle , as soon as I got on the thing and went to rolling under vehicle the center casters would not swivel from the weight<br /> (I'm 240) the skid marks left by wheels on concrete driveway looked bad. Kept using it removed drain plug from truck creeped/skidded back out to find that one of the wheels had snapped loose from the casting. Screamed, cussed, and boxed it back up.  Why do we continue to ship this junk over..Please stat away from this.
B00P9OF04I|5|Buy it... Made my 03 350z Headlights look like new.
B00S8KQCVU|4|Good Fit, nice color
B0023WGQZ6|1|They worked for a week then the low beams quit working , only have hi beams now
B0069RNVRC|5|Perfect!
B002E3194M|5|Product resolved my issue. I changed the blower two years ago because the fan was warped and stop running. The air conditioning stop working again( not blowing air again) and I thought  the blower went bad again, but I looked at some YouTube videos on how to repair, and I found out that I need to stop water from leaking into my water catch reservoir that was not draining. I unplug the reservoir, and check my fan to see if it worked first before buying a regulator and blower ($350-500) online.the blower tested well and I just purchased the regulator! Save my self a few hundred dollars doing it myself. If you test the blower, use two wires. Connect them to car battery.
B007V2D5OS|4|This thing is a tank! I'm not sure how much heat it reflects, as the material is not very reflective, but it sure does absorb a lot of thermal energy and is HOT to fold up and put away. Can't say I love it, but I like it pretty good. Hopefully the stitching isn't broken down by its own weight.
B00ZC20NUS|5|This 9-in-1 digital tire pressure gauge was exactly what I was looking for. It not only accurately measures my cars tire pressure but it comes with a bunch of other tools. I love the fact that it has a glass hammer built just in case I ever need one. The knife and screw drivers were a nice addition to the tire gauge. Overall a great tool to keep in your car and I will be purchasing another for my girlfriend.
B008WTO0G6|5|It arrived a bit bent up from the mail, but worked out just fine!
B0050M7V78|5|Easy to use.
B005N6XUIU|1|Runs real small ..
B00A8OBYCQ|5|it came out of the box ready to use.  fit perfectly to replace the old one.  fast service from the seller.
B006XKAC54|1|Does not fit my 2009 NissanMurano.
B0038AW6IS|5|fits well and looks great
B00C73D8V6|3|Cheaply made, but holds around $4.75 between quarter, nickels, and dimes.  Of course more if you put some in the bottoms cup, but that cup doesn't screw on, which makes it liable of falling off if too much weight is place in the bottom.
B000OAG2DK|5|I love it for the replacement of the old shower head in my RV I love that it has a on and off switch so you do not have to mess with the hot and cold knobs Every time
B002XM5G70|5|The decibel level inside the trailer was 73 with the old pump, the new one is at 60. Soooo much better. The ports are about an inch higher than my old pump, model number 2088-403-144. The fairly rigid pex tubing would not line up, I had to be a little creative to make it work. Not a deal breaker by any means, just an FYI in case you have a line connecting vertically like I did. My old pump is 10 years old and was still working, I just got tired of the noise at night.
B000HBM80M|4|Does the job
B0040HGPZS|1|waste of money. I have not had good luck with either of this manufacturers products.
B00W1WGSYM|5|got them in two days after i ordered them put them on with perfect fit and if you have a 94-98 stang these you need to<br />get that muscle car look from the back end of you car..
B00JIGJKP8|5|Excellent ... Thank you so much.
B000C5GAQQ|5|Good value.  Fixed the emission issue and my check engine light is now off.
B009DA95M2|5|excelent  A1A
B009995MTC|5|My husband got this magnet to prank one of his Marine buddies at work. He was very excited upon seeing the product. It is in perfect condition. His only quam is that the only way to retrieve the magnet is to admit that he is the prankster.
B00BJ7Z8GY|1|Did not fit,will refund no problem
B00746CLSC|5|Easy install. Fixed my starting problem. 2000 V Star 1100cc
B00KGGKQUC|4|Works to shade the car, keeps steering wheel from getting hot. Took 1 star off because the shade also gets hot. Does work for what I wanted it to do.
B0002JMF9I|5|used this to adapt my R12 manifold set for use with the small R134-a cans. works great, I've used it to charge 3 different cars so far.
B000EDUUJ4|4|It is OK to carry chairs on the RV ladder
B00HTA8ZOC|5|Awesome decal. Looks great on my sup cooler. It is durable and withstands the saltwater and sun.
B0019O1BS6|5|works perfect
B007A3TCHW|5|Works better than oem
B00JK322MW|5|I bought the OxGord 10 Gauge 150 Amp Extra Long 12 Feet Heavy Duty Super Power Booster Starter Commercial Grade Jumper Cables for Emergency Use and am very happy with my purchase.  The color coded orange and black cords keeps you from accidentally crossing wires which I think is great for a novice as myself.  Great value for the money.
B0002NIJV2|5|very good fit just right
B00WWFIJB8|1|Both ends broke off, one while riding, the other after stopping to see where the fuel was coming from and moving the rubber line to see. Nipple snapped right off into the hose. Avoid, or you'll suffer from these...
B001GS18HE|5|Works just like any 16mm crowfoot!
B00KTHU9MI|5|Great
B00L4V9ECY|5|Works great! Fixed the LED bulb hyperflash on my '05 Chrysler T&C.
B005HMLVAO|5|Seem like quality bars
B00D329DI2|4|They are not bad but not as described. They looked pretty deep on the picture but in real life they are just flat. Price is good for that quality. But we needed more deep mats.
B00L1S0JU6|5|Great towel for drying my car.  Suck up all the water on the car and makes it dry and looking buff.
B00CAKILAO|5|Looks nice. Fits good. Need a little cutting. Overall good quality.
B000C7YQ2Y|5|This is the second Stant 10510 I've been using on my 2006 Focus, and I am happy with the performance. The first one worked well for approximately 8 years and just recently gave in. That was some good longevity, I'd think.
B00KI6K86M|5|I've purchased, as my wife would say, too many LED 12v bulbs.  Many were junk!  This bulb is by far the best bulb I've purchased to date.  It produces as much if not more light than the original T10-920.  The color is great, munch like the original bulb as we accustom to.  Purchased a batch last year and more this year.
B00PQZPMYI|5|They appear to be an excellent product
B00ZV1MZ74|5|It says &#34;includes hardwear&#34;. I was unsure but could see in the photos what looked like a key slot. It does in fact come with keys that lock the bars into place!
B00KDLOLNS|5|Love it . It works
B00XCFZWMG|5|When the pump assembly arrived the ceramic plate for the fuel gauge was broken in half so the gas gauge won't work. Also looked like it had been used previous to me getting it. *update * when contacted seller replaced pump assembly right away. Very helpful!
B00K1NS0PS|5|Good quality product and easy to install.
B00OXPXUAK|1|Never worked properly. Didn't pair with android app.  Don't waste your money!!!
B00L8448C8|5|Perfect
B00J4PKAQG|5|Excellent
B008BL9MQ8|5|Worked well
B00YWD3JDG|4|Works fine, but it proved the old one worked also.
B00NWT59Q6|5|Did the job.
B001GJ3DZS|5|This brush made the cleaning job so much easier. It really got in those tight corners on the wheels.
B000C822SS|5|works great
B00U3GB9OC|5|Great product for my TJ. All bolts line up perfectly EXCEPT for the rear bumper. 2 bolts on the bottom fit but only 4 of the 8 fit other 4 need to be drilled. Don't know if it was designed like this or my 2000 TJ was just designed differently.
B00BD4YFO4|3|tops fit perfect for crown vic. bottoms not so good. still satisfied though.
B00YDSXGJM|5|Must buy for every vehicle !<br />I tried it out when my son's car battery was dead while he was washing it. In just a few seconds, it jumped !!<br /><br />My hubby's phone was dead while we were on the way to Vegas luckily this Hop & Fly worked well on also Android phone and then we tried to charge his laptop<br />So far we are so satisfied with such compact and light device. Well packaged also!
B0117T7FUK|1|Junk!  Fits my Shoei Hornet......but only after deburring all the edges where it mounts to the lock in tabs.  It is also very distorted when you look through it.  I won't even be able to use this.  I might change my rating if PGR has some decent customer service but so far this is one of my worst purchases on Amazon.
B00C6MYSH6|1|I bought two of rear wheel bearing for my 2008 RAV4 (Front wheel drive with third row seat). The bearing was good but, after 4 days of driving, one of the rear bearing abs sensor malfuntioning, it cause the ABS, VSC, Brake light up. so as to the cruise control stop working too.
B0012TURT2|4|I think in the future I'll spend the little bit extra to get 4 stroke packing as the only difference is the higher heat resistance.
B000CO73X6|4|My son was very pleased
B007DFWO40|5|Great decal. Exactly what i wanted. And shipped n arrived fast.
B001U04MSU|5|this charger has already paid for itself by bringing 3 car batteries back to life. I'm so happy I got it. I have a big 2/10/200amp charger but it doesn't do the recondition thing like this one will.
B00CXAC5MG|5|Great product
B000CF8W0S|5|wow they get here and i install them very fast clean the channels with pad provide wipe the inside and start the double side tape and insert them and pull tap, it was so easy and let them windows stay up 24 hours so defectors wont fall out, very good for the price and work well so far
B00C15M4WO|5|My bike has never started so easy with so many cranking amps one touch of the starter switch and the engine spins quickly to life and has never needed a another push of the switch
B00EC0YDX4|5|Can't even tell I broke my passenger mirror now with this replacement one. It fit in perfectly as if it were straight from the factory. It lined up with the original connectors just right without the need for any extra adjustments. The price was great too in comparison to what the dealership charges for a replacement mirror.
B000Z0HVHA|5|just what i needed
B0000AZ74O|1|Total rip off.  Tiny rolls that are not even as wide as a regular roll.
B00LV6W1WM|5|great cable
B00FY80OFO|5|Bought this to replace defective one in my truck. great product at a great price. there are some external differences from the oem but these are visual only. fits right in, weight wise it feels the same as the stock unit. considering you are replacing one made in China product with another, I don't see the logic for paying the GM markup for oem. the value added is just not there. here in Canada, the dealer wanted $239 +TX for the part, you can do the math.
B004A6OB5U|4|Radiator fit perfectly. Was surprised at how thin it was, though. However, it does fine. Shipped quickly and correctly. This one has plastic tanks and they do say GM on the side, so it probably is a direct factory replacement. All radiators these days seem to have plastic tanks. I'm very happy with this purchase.
B00NWF9AVU|5|Great product!
B00MNQU04U|5|Fit great.
B00YDE2SKO|5|Great size and stays on the window with no problem.  Very helpful for my twin nephews
B00496Z394|5|Its been 2 years and still going like a champ. Easy to change by just cutting a hole in the floor of my trunk.
B000BQLQYM|5|good value for price. I use it all the time on the water from the lake mead marina.
B00QZA9V90|5|Received quickly and install easily.
B00QSSL7O6|5|JUST PERFECT FOR MY LINCOLN...THANK YOU...
B003AYBWFU|4|It is good.  It was a little short song had to pay for an addition.
B00KJ8L7B4|5|Love it on my Camry
B0058O1WFU|5|By far the best set of end bars I have ever purchased.
B000C1MW8K|5|2009 Honda Accord EX-L i4 Sedan<br />Absolutely amazing! Replaced my front OEM pads (I will never ever go OEM with brakes again) with these in late March of this year, and they still have a lot of bite! Changed the front rotors to Wagner BD125674E in early June. I've put about 6000 miles on the pads and maybe 5700 miles on the rotors, and they're all still strong! I'll definitely buy them again!!!!...... if I'm looking for a &#34;replacement&#34;. If I'm looking for an &#34;upgrade&#34;, I don't think I'd get this particular set of pads.
B00KTHZJ1O|5|I love these keys, the dealers was going to charge 200 per key, but we got two keys done for 150.
B001AWN14Y|1|Mirrors don't fit on these bars. I have an fz09. It's almost like the bars are not perfectly round.
B005H49GTA|5|Easy to install and works great
B00GHT4QW6|5|arrived very good condition i am satisfied with correct item .
B0041U39AI|5|Product recieved in great condition including new bulbs!
B005EGMRB0|5|Great price.
B00PTADE7M|5|Looks really good on car
B000182DVU|5|Great
B0042VVKGG|5|must have
B00SVRHD22|5|Nothing wipes better
B000KL374U|3|it is okay fit perfect on my stereo
B000OUZYAW|1|Lasted a week then shock wouldn't hold pressure! Been waiting for a refund for almost a week
B000J3B142|4|Very nice fender bags. Fit my quad perfect! I would order more. I wish they had free shipping so I could order an extra set for my son.
B00F17Q87G|5|vvvery Good, Thank's  See You!!!!
B000CITK8S|5|These things are great.  I've got lots of vehicles that only get used part of the year and keeping the batteries on a tender when not in use for more than two weeks makes a big difference in battery life.
B002R4V1C8|1|i gave this a one star, when I received the package, it was one day late, when I opened the box I noticed that the bulbs where just moving around in its own package, nothing to secure it from moving around in its own package.  I put both bulbs in my car. the passenger side works but the driver side bulb does not work,  I like the super white intensity of the light that it gives off,  it looks like a new car coming at you.  I did not call and replace the broken bulb, I did not see spending another $30 just to maybe get one more bulb when I pay too get two bulbs.
B00LNNR9GG|5|Great lights. Very bright and priced good.
B00PQW0ZUM|4|It made my car look so nice... like a beast...lol
B009VXEXW8|1|Highly disappointed. It looks cheaply made. In fact it broke the second day I got it. Lame.
B009XOTRBM|4|Works very well... however be careful not to overload your bumper if you're using it for a bike rack.  I had five (yes I know) bikes on the back and the receiver held up perfectly but my bumper started pulling off the chassis.
B0068EQ7RC|5|fit the 4tec engine perfectly.
B00KV15KAS|5|Item as described. Fast delivery. Thanks
B004I0L54S|5|Great quality replacement.
B00UXUXUZE|5|Product as advertised. Delivered promptly. Thank you.
B00VGXSIUE|5|Great quality sticker tbh
B00KY35G1Q|5|Outstanding product.
B000AMW0FQ|5|Arrived fast and looked great!
B00GHT6SF4|5|Installed in 5 minutes, looks great!
B002P33KVQ|5|This pump was identical to the one that came with our trailer so was an easy switch.  I was able to get it back into the trailer without any problem and in fact re-located it so that if I ever need to pull it out, I will not have near the trouble I did.  I guess it is easy when you put something in and build around it.  It also came in record time and cost me 1/2 as much as the Trailer dealer here quoted me.  Tnank You again. I would easily rate this a five star.<br />thankafv
B0009KMH20|5|Used if for years-first found out about it in 2005 on a website called http://store.carcareonline.com/-based in NJ-I use on my 2012 black Accord and 2013 black Civic-I try to wax once a month since cars are outdoors, no garage.  Has a major shine to it-the car care rep said when he uses it, he applies it, and takes if off right away-but the jar says let sit for 30 minutes until a haze.  I found this way easier to take off, but the 30 minute time frame varies depending on the time of year-might be more or less-I found longer in winter months.  You can use the wax pads in a store, or I use a flannel sheet set ripped into small pieces.
B00THJZGJA|5|Came in fast but the driver was a redneck meathead that just grabed and pulled at the hood and ended up scratching it. I would not receommend you have it shipped
B004IKO09K|5|It is a very good product and I recommend it to others interested in troubleshooting.
B00B9IVRCW|5|Super product and great seller!
B005YHEHI0|3|Could be better or worse. Depends on ones tolerance as the frame does water spot. I replaced the included screws for stainless as the coastal area where I live is hard on anything metal. I later removed the frame after the photos, cleaned and sprayed with clear coat. I'll probably look for a chrome frame and put this on my pick-up. Was an easy install and the plastic screw cap/covers simply snap on and snap off just as easy. You can find about the same quality frame and price point at any local auto parts store and the &#34;blue&#34; department store.<br /><br />Typical Amazon Prime efficiency!
B00G66KM0A|5|Well vented and sturdy. Takes some time to break in. Also quiet enough at speeds.
B00UKJQH0S|5|These are great quality! They have a very high shine and are worth every penny. I've purchased three for a costume I made and they're exactly what I needed! I can't speak to how long they stick but so far it hasn't shown any signs of budging. Well worth it!
B0091W354G|4|Fits into place no issue, some cutting required on bumper and exhaust heat shield.  Be careful, the instructions say to cut a 3.75&#34; wide hole but if you measure the steel plate that protrudes it's actually 4&#34;.  Had to muscle this thing into place and then yank it out again to cut the hole wider.  Other than that fits fine, and holds my bike carrier with no issues.  It will block your rear-view camera if you have bikes loaded up, so be careful.
B00EI6CKVE|5|I hate those annoying &#34;look at our awesome family because we know you care&#34; stick figure family stickers. I love T-rex's. This was a natural pick for me. I've noticed quite a few smiles and chuckles in my rearview mirror. Good day when you can make folks lighten up a bit and have a laugh... ;)
B000FP8IZE|3|You don't really need this cheap plastic tool.  All you need is a good pair of needle nose plyers and a hammer to accomplish exactly the same thing.  I never used it because the other way was so easy, but it is cheap enough I didn't bother sending it back.
B0000AY2Z6|5|Finally an efficient quiet 12V fan. Use it on my pontoon boat for when we're sitting still enjoying some (not wine officer) and cheese at sunset...
B00MKBCMYY|5|Works great.  Quality part.  Things you need to know.  First you will have to take the 3 bolts holding the compressor to the engine off.  Next disconnect all of the wire harnesses to the alternator and to the coolant temperature sensor and whatever the other ones for.  Disconnect the air filter housing.  This will enable you to lift the compressor up high enough to get the clutch apart.  Use an impact on the bolt to get it off.  Reuse the spacer from the old clutch, it will save you time.  You'll need a snap ring pliers or your life will suck.  In hindsight i should have left the old magnet on,  since it was working fine.  It was a bit of a pain to put the new one on.  Also I put a new belt on and it was impossible to get it on without a special serpentine belt breaker bar kit.  Advance auto had a loaner.
B001G79OTY|5|Perfect fit
B00HCR5Q26|5|Great fit and easy install.  Recommend.
B0043YIFGU|1|Do not buy this it is a piece of crap it did not work at all I had several friends try it as well and now bcc it's after the return window I wasted my money.  I wouldn't even give it one star.  I was trying to use it for gas from a generator so I could empty it out and get it ready for storage. Garbage! Look elsewhere
B001UE9SS0|5|It was a pain getting the old ones out of my 2004 Honda civic, but it was worth it. The car handles better because of it.
B0051D3MP6|5|No need to waste the money on a battery tender. I have both and the battery tender with the same features is twice the price. Neither charges faster or maintains better.
B0000AYFTH|1|The set had a missing ground wire - providing only three of the required four wires in the extension.  When the trailer was physically coupled to the truck, all lights worked correctly - most of the time - due to the ground path provided by the coupler.<br /><br />This took a bit of time to suss out, until I discovered that the ground was not installed at all.<br /><br />What's going on here, have these folks hired Microsoft quality engineers?
B0000AZ9KS|2|this thing is not at ALL what I expected, it is far too bulky at the ratchet section, and honestly, it isn't strong at ALL.  flexes and doesn't hold it's position.  If the packaging were better, I would have sent it back.  Packaging is such that you destroy it buy simply removing it from the packaging.
B000WKEZ40|5|Super fast shipping awesome product. Well worth every penny.
B00F1Z6U9O|5|Wonderful seller, excellent product
B00FQU2SCW|5|look ok
B0093RRSXS|2|Don't fix
B000OTOA9Y|5|it fit
B00E5UAOXE|5|They are very cute.  The goofy one is hard to figure out because it has Mickey Mouse ears.  But it is still cute.
B001IGGLGC|4|Right length and easy to use to hook up rafts and tubes.
B00P7IHAQC|3|They are ok but not distinctively noticeable.
B00JHK81X2|5|Thank you. Great delivery timing and loaded with everything one would need.
B0002MACJ0|4|Works as expected
B00WE65J3G|5|Sooooooo easy to install.  Looks incredible
B00C8YYMD2|5|it's so cute..exactly what I was looking for.
B0012IL42M|2|This is a tight fit on my 2015 Hayabusa.<br />I could get all the clips attached to the tank except one.<br />As one reviewer stated, it is not smooth like in the picture.<br />Mine is wrinkled near the seat.<br />Looks messy.
B004BFW0EO|5|Did a great job of getting rid of some nasty water spotting on my clear film bra and the finish.
B0012PTAJY|5|Fit perfectly in a Buick Ultra. Original airlines plumbed right up to these shocks. Restored the ride and handling.
B00YTZGSKI|1|Fits Rams up to 2014???? No way-  I own a 2012 Ram 1500 and this thing did not even come close to fitting. I tried it in multiple ways and there was no way. On the hunt now for another center consul cover :(
B0002SRH4W|5|Performs as it is supposed to time and time again. Hasn't let me down yet.
B0045V3Q2O|1|Wiper came without the adapter. I had to use the old one.  Not disclosed as missing when offered as open box item.  Incomplete item is not the same as used.  Not happy at all.
B00F64ROUO|4|I really liked this cover and I would still have it today had the car wash place not destroyed it! perfect fit and nice logo but just be warned that the tire cover can easily come off.....apparently.
B006XD6Y4Y|5|Grips are awesome
B001BCGYII|5|Good work fein
B005MJYTYC|5|This brace was perfect for when I dislocated my shoulder at a volleyball tourney last year.  Adds greater stability and support.  Totally easy to use and put on.  The extra adjustable straps are perfect for supporting specific areas.  Only recommendation: carefully adjust the Velcro is you want it to last longer.
B000EQR6FM|4|Fit exactly in my 2001 GMC Sierra.  Would give it 5 stars but 3 weeks after install, the &#34;auto&#34; function for the Driver's window stopped working.
B004XGWNF2|5|Very good quality tool
B009XISL56|5|These cams really woke up my 103&#34; Dyna.  It sounds awesome at idle, you can definately tell my Dyna has cams.  I added the S&S lifters and had it Dyno tuned with the TTS Mastertune and I got 100HP and 110 FPT.  Shipped fast and well packaged.  Highly recommend
B000VUATNC|5|Fit perfectly.
B000C57WD6|5|good product
B00LKXJ3DQ|5|Really happy with this purchase. I recently went shopping for a used car. Plugged this puppy into each vehicle then took it for a test drive. Very quickly ruled out the car with intermittent bad sensor readings!<br /><br />First plug this into a car at home to see how it works, and get your software working. You will have to sync via WiFi. Some software (DashCmd) can be configured in advance for a given car model & year. Do all his before you go.<br /><br />Then tell the seller, &#34;This will tell us what's going on with the engine and electronics. May I plug it in? I'll show you everything it tells us. Even if I don't buy the car, it could save you money with a mechanic!&#34; Any seller who won't let you plug this in has something to hide...<br /><br />Then take your test drive, and look at your iPhone/Android when you get back. Be sure to check the &#34;History Codes&#34; or whatever your software calls the stored codes- these are problem codes that happened BEFORE your test drive. Ask the seller to explain.<br /><br />You will have to purchase software to use this. On IOS, I tried both DashCmd and EngineLink. Both work well with this scanner.<br /><br />Highly recommended. I'm very happy. We ended up buying a one-owner 2003 Civic with low miles and no codes.
B0009IQZJS|5|I can clean my guns soooo quietly now. Invest in the adapters that come with outer thread covers though.
B000VKTULY|4|This cabin air filter was the perfect replacement for our 2013 Toyota Camry.  The quality of the filter is comparable to the original part and costs much less.  Save even more by installing it yourself on some lazy afternoon as you're vegging on the couch in your underwear.
B00S74JZ0W|5|Fit my 2008 Dodge Ram perfectly. Note that this is for one piece, which is what I needed.
B00EO3WIAO|5|Perfect fit, great price
B00VAVSTV0|1|Worst parents ever
B00JIEX722|4|It worked fine, but I had to remove a small portion of the padding underneath the arrow symbol in order to make the light cover snap into place. I ordered this product for my 03 Protege5.
B005LD2ONC|1|Worked for 2 days then kept blowing internal fuse
B00176MVQM|4|Perfect
B00G620ZVU|5|First the bad...  I bought these to install on the engine guard on my 1986 Honda V65 Magna.  When they are properly aimed at sufficient angle to provide the best light there is a huge BRIGHT glare pattern directly in front of my motorcycle.  I find it to be so bad in fact that it actually decreases my ability to see at a distance.<br /><br />OK, now the good...  These things are BRIGHT! They put out an incredible amount of light considering the low current draw..  If I owned a truck I would buy more sets!  I am going to donate this set of lights to my friend for installation on his Bobcat, or one of his big commercial lawn mowers.<br /><br />I have no idea what I am going to put on my motorcycle,  but if I need a pair of lights with this beam pattern I would buy them again immediately.
B001V8UKBY|5|Hans device and works great.
B007XILPLU|1|Installation was easy, but the cuts are small , they don't cover the whole headlight, and they don't line up correctly.  For almost $60 I would expect it to line up perfectly on the headlights, and not be off by 5mm . As for quality of materials I can't really judge now until I drive the car  for a while,  but it smells and feels just  like any other polyurethane, plasticy stuff. I don't recommend using it- It will just mess up the look of your car.
B00IDQZZR6|5|i painted the spoiler, it fit perfectly with two sided tape
B00JVEXT7C|5|It actually worked!! For the first time in 2 years, the guys at the shop thought it was so funny, they quit taking my tools and finally are leaving my S@#* alone!!
B00CCWK17Q|4|I love the sticker, my only issue was that I thought that the back ground was clear. but that seemed less important. so I kept it. I did trim it and put it on the side of my jeep. wife hates it , BUT I love it!
B00DQJ8WLG|4|Great!
B000F2FEF4|5|Great fit. Blocks the sun. A happy return customer!
B00OUGGUTU|5|I got this for my brother great product he loves it! Sounds loud and clear it is awesome so many sounds and being able to use your own voice love it love it love it
B008BLKZJG|5|Worked well
B000IYX6RW|1|The part in the did not fit a 1992 Chevy K1500. Amazon made me pay return shipping even tho the green check mark said this fits your car. As far as the part goes,who knows.
B0012GTVVA|5|A+ bought a second one for our rear bathroom door.
B000NKCIWK|5|After a few days in out little 4 cylinder engine and there is noticeable power improvement and decreased hesitation, esp with the AC on.  We will have to see on gas mileage.  I have not filled the tank yet. Based on my experience, it pays for itself in 20,000 miles because of the extended life of the filter.  Seems like a win win win so far.
B005DUKGNI|5|Great product.
B00OZYHOE2|3|Too small for my head...... but they work very good and lenses are Chrystal clear.
B00JXLXC84|5|Love these family stickers. They fit on my black car just right. I had to buy two packs for our big family. But the price was great.
B001UC72UI|5|Used in a 2006 Dodge Magnum SRT-8. Took it about 15 minutes but all 4 were recognized and have been working well. The tech put a rear tire on the front and had to swap them back right...they were working in correct position before he drove it back around to the service bay. Good work Dorman.
B00BQYCJKI|4|Great towels for a good price (when I purchased, at least).  Should work well for cleaning around the house, car windows, trim, wheels, waxing, etc.  Wouldnt use them for polishing after waxing - get a thicker towel for that.  Good general purpose towels, soft and durable.  One star off for the stupid tags on every towel...not sure why the company puts them on there, but they need to be cut off before you use the towels.  Don't rip them off or you will mess up the border stitching and cause the fibers to unravel, cut them off as close to the towel as you can with a sharp knife or scissors.
B00BUIHFM2|5|Great item , good quality , item was as described , excellent.
B0013AFUW4|5|bought it for my father in law and it was easy to install and very helpful for him to get in and out of his pick up bed
B000NU3LPS|1|This is not compatible with a 2011 F250 super duty.  The Amazon automobile &#34;You Carport&#34; does not advise buyer of this.  The return shipping is more that the product purchase price.  I am stuck with a non compatible product.
B00HH8NOCE|1|These are junk. Looked good for the first few days. Then they turned yellow. Pretty much all of the emblems on Amazon are this same sticker design which sucks and changes colors after a few days. Just get real ones and buy the black inserts to cover the blue
B0055EALW8|5|Great price
B011Q18D14|4|Product works great. I had a couple different lights on in my car and it got rid of them for me. I love that I am able to check my car conveniently in my own drive way. It saves me lots of time and money. I would highly recommend this product.
B00BLZ8QRC|4|I really like this switch. Hairpin activation, wgich is just fine for my application.
B000KL74IU|5|This product exactly fits in my Highlander 2007.
B009PJKAZW|4|fast shipping. good product.
B004GQZPQI|1|These do not line up with a 2001 Durango RT as advertised. I messed around with it for a half hour. The wire connectors were correct but the location of the tabs were off. If you put the first tab into the quarter panel the two screw tabs line up 1' too low. If you line up the screw tabs first you cant get the mounting tab into the quarter panel. I could see maybe If I cut and chopped pieces here and there maybe it might work. But id rather get my money back and get a better product.  *I decided to go give it the old college try one last time. As a seasoned mechanic I figured maybe ill be able to get it to work. Nope poor design. The main issue is at the top of these lights there is a delta shaped piece of plastic that juts out - there are two screws through it an a small vent screen. Well Im sure this serves a mounting and venting purpose but in the meantime it hits the top of the quarter panels prohibiting a solid fit. The is no way around this. Frankly Spyder has enough auto parts available I assumed they would have better quality control. As such promoting this as workable for Durango models - 2003 is a lie. Re engineer or take it down as applicable for Durangos - I cant speak for its Caravan uses.
B00GSBKNF2|5|Installed on a 1993 RX7<br />Works great!!<br />I did not have the room for the gallon jug so I tapped into the windshield washer reservoir.<br /> Don't forget to prime the system with the &#34;test button&#34;<br /><br />I would by this kit again
B0050HGZC0|5|MUCH better than those that are simply a plastic hook that u have to fiddle with to get it around your rearview mirror.  This just simply clicks on and off....GREAT invention....very impressed...highly recommend!
B0002V4PRG|5|Works great  Blow off my new xmart around pulleys  does good
B003JJ5BAI|4|This is a heavyweight, high quality jacket, and looks just as good as the picture. But I was surprised to see a motorcycle jacket run so small, especially in the waist.<br /><br />I'm 5&#34; 8&#34;, 170 lbs, and wear 34&#34; pants. Getting my medium jacket on is a real struggle because it's very hard to get the zipper to come together. I can't really wear anything more than a t-shirt under it.<br /><br />The chest (I'm a 42 there) fits fine, and I wouldn't want a large because I think it would be too big in the chest. But the waist tapers a *lot*.<br /><br />The &#34;sizing chart&#34; is unfortunately just a generic chart that lists traditional suit jacket sizes instead of S-M-L-XL. So you'll need to browse around in the reviews to find the right size based on your own measurements. But if you can manage to get one that fits you, you'll probably like it. It's a pretty good price for a premium leather jacket.
B0124B020K|5|I am not an Uber driver, but we have a friend that is from a bigger city and drives all over. I will be giving one of these decals to her to place on her car or whatnot. I may even become an Uber driver for our town because it's pretty rare around here and I am sure there are people that need rides around here. Our city has a bus, but not a taxi or anything. The decal is big enough to be clearly visible in any car window when I held it up. Probably not from quite a distance, but if fairly close you should be able to tell the logo. I was given the opportunity to receive these for a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions are 100% my own.
B00DOS0PMS|1|Worthless and doesn't work very well.
B001C9J6TE|5|The description was good. So...I was able to identify this very unique filter from many others that were incorrect. It fit the twin carb 1965 Buick nailhead air cleaner housing as it was intended to fit. The Hastings AF26 fit like the original AC filter.
B005MX016S|5|Works very well.  I will keep buying this product.
B0012WHBSO|5|Very portable.
B000GTWV84|5|Authentic oem kit. Worked perfectly. Would not recommend replacing check valves unless they are damaged. If you do, dental floss works well for pulling rubber nipple through.
B00FQEC6SE|5|As advertised fit perfect
B00W8LIVK0|3|I had to replace the tape but they fit my wife's car real nice and do what I wanted them to do.
B00JQ6HHG4|5|I was totally impress when I opened the box, the picture does not do this item any justice. I highly recommend these step bars to anyone who have a truck and in the market for great set of step bars. You will not be disappointed, Beautiful chrome, really pretty to look at and brings out the best in your vehicle.
B00KTHY91K|5|As advertised.
B00OTXVXAA|5|Very good for my park lights. The LED is kinda bend but still work and bright.
B00GJKXW8M|5|Very bright, easy install. Wired into headlights to come on with bright lights. Solid Build
B002K5WXXU|5|Looks so cute! I love how it looks on my car! 
B007H2PYBY|2|Sits well, and looks good but is VERY cheaply make. Side seams are ripping after being sat in only 4.times. once by the recipient (135 lbs) and 3 times by a 10 year-old child (82 lbs). DO not plan on this chair lasting. Amazon wouldn't even honour 30 day return policy.
B000S2ST6W|5|This set of wires fit my 1999 Camaro Z28 perfectly. Good quality product.
B0014SQVA0|3|tough one to review . do people not read or is it they cant read, or is it they don't care
B00GKRQ7DG|5|Great quality my sister loves it
B00Y3H0M0E|5|Just received these yesterday. Look like nice quality. Hope they work well.
B00P3IAYSC|5|These work Great !!!!
B000CPATNQ|5|Great product.
B001O07X96|5|Exellent product and delivery thank you
B00AMPHPXS|5|Good product
B000EH0ORI|5|Works as expected
B00B4XBQPU|5|Looks great.  Doesn't obscure any information on the plate.
B000C8T7MW|5|Nice OEM style replacement...
B00NIZZZ5Y|3|box is open, filer has mold on one side already
B00HRHR3VI|5|Easy to install and looks classy.  Reinforces it for grandkids and our kitty (she loves looking out the door).
B00C308I8G|5|Very nice quality
B003JICQNY|5|This was a replacement for a Reese slider hitch. Fit perfect.  Fast shipping and arrived intact .
B00G1Y38JE|5|Work and look awesome
B0015KH93K|4|tips supplied do NOT fit all cores.  I have a 2007 Ford F150 that has a large diameter core on the high side that the tool did NOT fit.  I had to make a new tip for the tool to make it to work.  Once I reengineered it, it worked fine.<br /><br />Too bad the Amazon site indicated it was the correct tool for my vehicle.  I'm sure that Mastercool makes a kit with the correct tool ends for my vehicle; but, this is NOT it.<br /><br />Using this tool I was able to replace a leaking valve before I lost a critical amount of pressure in my system, allowing me to simply refill without evacuation with no moisture intrusion into the system.
B0009JB7GI|4|Really pestering that the fourth socket is for cigarette lighters only.
B000VT0JOW|4|With the rain we have had and the hot days this has helped keep airflow in the SUV and the rain out. Recommend this product to anyone that has a Truck, SUV, or van.
B000NU3OF0|5|Works great on carpet!
B00NY4VE90|5|the bolts did the job and are good quality, thanks!
B0009IBJE4|1|This unit did not fulfill my expectations. I was looking for a deep cycle marine battery charger. This was cheap at best, and I don't mean the price.
B00U37EVXM|4|I read these jackets ran a touch on the small size so I purchased a 2xl (I normally wear an XL) and it fits well. There are two liners, one insulating and another for wet riding. All in all a comfortable riding jacket to offer some extra protection. I'm happy with it.
B001B5GA0C|5|worked great
B007W7TNHU|1|poor match and a shipping cost greater than the product cost. VERY dissatisfied
B001G8AIMU|3|There isn't much to say. The quality is ok. The charger is well built except for the alligator clips. They are too narrow and short which makes them difficult to open. I charged my new lawn mower battery and it did the job. I have no other complaints than the alligator clips.<br /><br />That said, I'd have given it more stars if the alligator clips were better. They are what is handled the most when using the charger which is why I gave it only the &#34;It's Okay 3 Stars&#34; rating. If they put on better clips I'd have rated the charger 4 or maybe 5 stars.
B0002MA9WA|5|These things are awesome. It makes a solid ramp without breaking the bank. I used them with perforated treated lumber instead of regular Douglas fir
B00UTXS0D2|3|Not exact fit, a bit(1-2mm) smaller in diameter as well as the curves/bends being slightly off. If I had to do it again I'd spend the extra money to get brand name kit.
B00KSLLNOS|1|Waste of money. Bought for a suzuki z400. It fits and looks identical but the throttle cable is clocked a few degrees in the wrong direction making it ride the frame.  I installed it and it ran but upon riding it around for a weekend at the park i realized it was running way too rich. Air screws are non adjustable. Its as if it has a high float condition. I took it apart and tried to adjust the float to compensate for the rich condition.  Didnt work. Not adjustable. With the bike at idle you can shake it and it will die. Tried calling there telling me it must be something else. I want my money back for this chinese pos
B000C16XPI|3|They work, but I'm not particularly pleased. When the window is all the way down these new motors cause the interior side of the door panel to bulge a little bit. Same issue on driver and passenger side. Motor is securely fastened and screwed down tight. Small screws are a PITA to get in but if you have small fingers it works.  I saw some other good tips on here about using double-sided tape on your finger and hold the nut while you get the screw in.  Part of me wishes I had pursued OEM AC Delco, especially since they are about the same price, but reading those reviews there are a fair share of complaints as well.
B0012BL8LG|1|I was so excited to have this adapter, and i waited a week before i gave a review. Sadly it only lasted about 4 uses then it went out. It no longer works and is heading to the garbage.
B00Y3U5C6A|5|I'm not exactly certain how this jacket can be rated 2 stars w/o really testing it out. I don't mean by, &#34;taking a spill off my Savage&#34; testing, I mean wearing it for a while before rating and reviewing it. That's what I did after receiving a complimentary sample. The material IS something akin to &#34;book bag&#34; material but only in texture, this jacket is made with MUCH thicker/stronger material than that of a &#34;Jansport&#34; so to say that is WAY off, (sorry dude). I'm a Large in jackets butwas sent an XL but I think maybe the seller did this on purpose because the XL fit me fine, a Large would've affected my range of motion so I'm good w/ the sizing. On to versatility & asthetic, &#34;you want a jacket w/ those pockets?&#34;, yeah, plenty of well placed pockets on this and some well placed ventilation zippers as well. Look folks, for $77 (shipping included), it's a solid bike jacket.
B00932FBUU|3|I bought two and on one of them the LED just stopped
B00JMCCMJ4|4|It is very good hydrocrack but noak at 11.5, there are better options. Not a true syn, but probably the best oil for direct injection engines, among the cheap crackers from US. In EU it would be called syn technology and could not even come close to true syn oils. Enjoy the price savings..
B009HQJIJ2|5|I bought this (2 of them) for my 2001 F350 super duty w/7.3Ldiesel 4x4 with Dana 50 axle. Though Amazon's application guide said it would not fix, it does. Hopefully they will read this and update their product application guide. Great product can't ever go wrong with Moog parts. Note for you do-it-yourself guys and gals. Very tough to get the old ones out I rented a ball joint press and used a variety of sockets and spacers to get it done. I don't recommend beating on the parts with a socket and hammer. The yokes are somewhat delicate, so be careful here. Also pre-soak all the parts the night before with rust-buster. You'll thank yourself in the morning.
B000CNB2Y8|5|Quality at low price
B002684PVE|5|OEM for my Onan Generator.
B00K1KNCOK|4|These are bright sticking LEDs exactly what I was looking for . I'm using them on my flat gendered jeep and did a lot of brush jumping and they held up pretty well, you can also cut the strip for a shorter strip,
B0007TR47G|5|Great wax at a great price.
B00N9L989Q|5|He is adorable.  I don't have a car antenna, he is sitting on a stick in one of my plants.
B00A0YJRB4|3|got on time /worked on door/ plastic handle
B004A2WXWW|5|Purchased as a back up replacement.  I am sure it is fine,
B0042XORMI|5|As expected.  Very happy with having so many fuses and not having to pay through the nose for a couple at a local parts store.
B001KS7G7Q|5|Fit my 2002 Toyota Camry perfectly . It has been for more than two weeks, no problem so far, wish it can work the same way for a long long time.
B00AUIZGIS|5|Was able to check oil pressure on couple tractors, trucks and a car. Has all the fittings that a weekend or shadetree mechanic could need. Very pleased!
B006CN9FNM|5|Oem transmission kit. All items as described. Quick shipping.
B001DMFPV8|5|Fit well, a little struggle with the bumper on install.  2 door 1999 jeep cherokee
B0031BQ86K|5|Sturdy mirror . 90mph 1600miles no rattling glass nice and smooth.
B005I60VZK|5|Take a dare, take a chance! Product is great; but, comes with no directions - probably for liability concerns. The remedy is YouTube. Dial in your particular application and watch the video; write it down; or, watch it on your phone in the car! Whatever avenue you take, it's less than a minute affair in my case. Your only obstacle is getting the Vendor to cut a key with a transponder in it. So, make friends with the locksmith in your neighborhood. If you have two keys, the programing of the fobs is no more difficult; but mine did come with directions. Just find a video on the net and you'll be fine; feel good about yourself; and, have saved considerable dollars ........
B001QUD6R2|5|Works as advertised I am pleased with the product
B00Z3MWXU0|4|Easy to install and look great.
B00NMRIUMI|5|Excellent
B00BZQRAIS|3|Not a good fit for a 2015 ram 3500
B0023V7DDQ|5|Excellent product. Should have bought the right hand side
B004NKYJMS|5|good product
B000KEFKYW|5|Item shipped very fast, was exactly as described, worked perfectly for my truck, and was the best price!
B00QKJDQ3S|3|Issue 1: Heat shield doesn't allow proper fitment<br />Issue 2: Blockage in one primary tub on passenger side<br />I read the reviews about these headers and still went ahead and bought them, not from this seller though, when I got the headers, both issues mentioned here were true (even though was from a different seller) so I had to address both issues. For the heat shield, I went ahead and clipped off the heat shield and ground the leftover weld and to solve the heat issue I bought (here in Amazon) the DEI Titanium 2&#34; Exhaust wrap (I'm planning also in adding the DEI Titanium Vulcan Lava Protector Sleeve Spark Plug Wire Boot later on). for the 2nd issue, I had couple of burr bits laying around in my garage and ground down the excess material that caused the blockage. I bought the headers not for performance but as an upgrade from the cast iron stock that are so prone to crack in several places.
B00ELHNK64|5|Got it for my son's BMW, he likes the product
B00SIFOHZI|5|Great! I bought it for my dad and he loved it! Had no problem installing it!
B00C890LRS|4|Good quality, fits OK.
B000C2UHU4|4|good fit and works perfectly
B00KNOS05A|5|Great price
B00MWULLP4|5|Great price works like oem clips...most definitely would recommend this product. 100 clips for $8 compared to $15 for 6 at other autoparts stores
B001U2DPUE|5|Installed easily and picked up a half dozen more stations.  Also decreased dropouts and picture freezing during stormy weather.
B00F3FDYJQ|4|Thin plastic and easy to overtighten, but works as advertised. This is the second one I have. Works ok. Cheaper than the Twin Air but thinner too.
B00KLKVRNS|5|great product great stopping power, exactly what I would want on all my vehicles, these rotors and brakes truly are the best in my opinion. no brake dust, no squeaks, no wondering if your going to stop  before hitting the car infront of you.  I would deff recommend these brakes for any car. I am going to purchase the same set up for the back of my 2006 Chevy Monte Carlo.
B0002KKIXC|5|I now have 2 kinds of Blue Magic and I love them both.  My husband even uses it for his car upholstery.<br />But it. U won't regret it.
B000E2AR0C|5|This is my second k&n filter for my Harley and appears they are doing a good job. The filter on a Harley bagger is hard to get to and that nut on the end of k&n is just the ticket. Able to get the filter off with minimal oil loss.
B001DRGCHY|5|Exelente time
B002XM5G70|5|fits in the space allowed good & good pressure
B00BCRMC1U|4|I ordered this set for my Nissan Altima. I like the color, which is a hot pink. The material feels good.  It doesn't make you sweaty like some materials. It fit my seats pretty well; only thing I can say is in my car it's hard to get the hooks on the front seats. My seats have a material that goes up from the bottom of my seat to the back of it.<br /><br />Some people have complained of a horrible smell but mine did not have a horrible smell. It did have a little bit of a smell when I first opened it but it went away quickly.
B0006IX87S|4|Nice product to take sediment off the RV parks waters but no the taste, we still have to use my &#34;Zero Water&#34; pitcher to clean the taste of the water.
B005R1P2PU|5|Great product for boats too abrasive for car paint.good price.
B005NXMFW0|5|Works great, my 5 year old climbs all over it and it has held up well.

B000C9DHBI|5|My car ac knobs were all loose and the ac got stuck in hot. After several months of enduring this hot summer, I managed to replace it with this amazing product and it works better than new .I really recommend you to buy it.
B00EVPM0LC|2|The pump is not well made.  When using it to pump gear oil into the differentials on my FJ, I had to pull the handle and wait several seconds each time in order for the fluid to transfer.  The housing leaked, getting gear oil everywhere, and I simply threw the thing away after finishing up work on my truck.  I'll find a better quality product elsewhere, and definitely do not recommend this item.
