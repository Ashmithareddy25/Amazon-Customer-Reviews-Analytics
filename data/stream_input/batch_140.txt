B007IQGJK4|1|not waterproof in the slightest bit. They all faded, filed with moisture, and all stopped working. Waste of money
B00H7H2H50|4|Perfect fit
B003PF7140|5|Used this replacing the front bumper on a Jeep Liberty. Simple to use, worked pretty well to install the rivets. The size of the setter was fine. I had no issues getting it into the several places I had to install a rivet. Happy with the construction (it feels pretty solid) and I hope to get more usefulness out of it in the future. Hopefully not to replace a smashed bumper, though.
B004C443L2|3|Love the coat, I wear a 2xL in a carhart coat & it a little big on me. I first ordered a 2xl, to little, then I order a 3xl, still to little, I ordered a 5xl, it fit???<br />I had to order 3 sizes bigger to fit. BUT it is a great coat!! I would give it 5 stars if the sizing was better!!
B004RCWZ2S|1|I knew I was buying a plastic faucet, they all seem to be plastic faucets for RV tubs & showers.  I read all the descriptions and this one seemed to be one of the best, so I thought.  It is described as having brass parts????<br />Description:  Contains brass stem and bonnets & Celcon Underbody (which is a form of plastic).<br />Ok, I don't see one brass part except for 2 tiny brass / gold screws.  The entire thing appears to be plastic.  The celcon underbody is no better plastic than the top part of the faucet & it is scratched up right out of the new packaging, view my photo.<br />The packaging weight was described as 2 lbs where the other faucets were noted to be 1 lb.  I'm figuring that I am buying a better faucet with brass parts / NOT!!  The thing is light as a kite.  IT WEIGHS 11 OUNCES without packaging.  I now understand that no plastic RV faucet is better than the other.  If this faucet contained any brass parts it would weigh more than 11 ounces total weight!!<br />*****If anyone can recommend a decent RV tub faucet with the diverter I would certainly appreciate it.*****  I am very, very disappointed with this faucet.  Save your money.  You just as well buy a 15.99 faucet with free shipping off of Ebay the quality is the same.  Hope this review saves someone else from this bad experience.
B004I11074|5|Fit right in. Perfect match. Packaged really well. Would by other parts from this manufacturer, easily. Only lacks OEM label, but Depo can be proud of their product.
B000BPSWFY|5|Very durable. Where I live, we don't get snow, but the windows will frost over and need scraping.  These are heavy duty - can't find these in southern Mississippi. I am very happy with them. Have one in each car.
B000BUQOG8|5|Works as expected
B00I5X072U|4|So far so good.... very easy to replace
B001P2JONQ|5|Good product....on time delivery.
B00C0SQ8KG|5|very good lites
B00GFAIA2Y|5|great product and little surprised however that this tank came without any manual or paperwork on how to install.
B004A1UNQ6|5|great original part- works perfectly - easy to install- great price- fast service I would recommend this co. to any one
B009PHKSDI|4|Good product for the money.
B003ZZJQEI|2|cheap goggles. They fit but not great.
B00332GB7S|1|this is made very thin of cheap plastic it looks like a toy on my car what a joke it is
B00681BE2S|5|Great price.  Followed DIY programming instructions and it worked!
B001OTBGH2|5|I love this Domo-kun! He has stayed on through all types of weather! It did come with a magnet, but I'd rather have him on my car :)
B001KQA9YU|5|It was the exact model I needed. Fits perfect in good condition.<br />I will always continue to order from Amazon
B000MK5LVG|5|Well built box
B000BRF3WM|5|This was a do it yourself job. I got the materials I needed and climbed to the top of my camper and applied it. We put a new rubber roof on camper but had to clean it before we did anything else.
B00ABW7WEE|5|The OEM part that this replaces is over $200.00.  This one worked perfectly in a 2007 Audi A4.  Installation takes about 30 seconds.<br /><br />Thank you!
B00FGOTPHY|1|DO NOT!!! I say again DO NOT purchase this item if you own a mustang. I have an '06 an this item is roughly 6-8 inches short. The only plus to this item that the material it's made out of.
B008X5XFQA|5|I bought this elsewhere for the same money. The kit includes a Universal harness with inline fuses, the mirror, a plastic wire cover, instructions and 3 year warranty card. My kit also included an extra mounting plate adapter, but I didn't use it in my 2014 Honda CR-V.<br />  The CR-V has a wedge plate which the new mirror fits nicely on, and it is secured with a #20 Torx screw. The install in my car involved removing the left \\"A\\" Pillar trim, taking care to avoid damage to the upper clip which can then be re-used. If it is damaged then you have to order one for about $5. Another piece of trim down lower around the fuel door lever needed to be removed as well for access to the fuse block and grounding nut. I used a plastic snake to feed the harness from low to high. Wire ties (not included) are used to secure the harness to the existing \\"A\\" pillar harness, and loosening up some of the headliner components allows the harness to be slipped underneath the front edge of the headliner. There is an included plastic wire cover which has to be trimmed to cover the wire between the headliner and the mirror.<br />  I used 2 Fuse taps also called Add A Circuits, (low profile mini-fuse in my Honda CR-V), and found an empty slot for the constant power and a slot for the switched power was shared with the rear wiper circuit. I wanted to avoid splicing my car's wires, and the Add A Circuit taps are a great way to do it. I cut off the inline fuses and spliced the Add a Circuits, which each have their own fuse for the tap and use the original fuse for the existing fuse in the slot.<br />  The auto dimming function worked perfectly and the Homelink setup was a snap, and it works well with the 2 garage doors I have, one is an old Overhead Door system, and the other is a newer rolling code system with required using the \\"Learning\\" button on the door opener itself to work.<br />  I can't think how this could have been any better, and for the money a great deal, since a factory OEM dimming only mirror without the Homelink costs more than this one.<br />Update: Having used this for nearly a week, I do have one thing I think would improve the usefulness: back-lighting of the buttons so you can see which one to push. All you can see in the dark is the on off LED. Alternatively raised bumps would assist in the tactile identification in the dark. I can tell which button I'm pushing by the relative position near the LED, but such a simple thing as bumps is easy to do with no additional cost. In use this mirror has been great with almost instant dimming when needed at night.ng only mirror without the Homelink costs more than this one.<br />Update: Having used this for nearly a week, I do have one thing I think would improve the usefulness: back-lighting of the buttons so you can see which one to push.

B004UPZVSC|4|I've used both the 12v outlets and the USB outlets many times. They provide, as far as I can tell without using a multi-meter, clean power. My devices have been satisfied with it, and so am I.<br /><br />I sits conveniently in a cupholder and provides 2 USB ports and 2 DC ports; plenty for my needs.
B002JHBIK8|5|The key chain is a bit brighter than the picture but still just as cool. The sender didn't skimp on the packaging.
B00FJ5LBOA|5|TOO LOUD BUT OKAY
B004AH4PAK|3|It works.
B003LFO7VY|5|As I was searching to buy a Tonneau Cover for my truck , I ran into this brand and I read nothing but good things about this. When I got it,  I was very happy to see the reviews were what I expected.  Thanks
B003IFL7XS|5|Bought this for my girlfriend, and I'm really, really impressed! The shipping was very fast, faster than anticipated actually, and the item came without any damage to itself or its outer packaging. It looks so much better up close, it's a lot shinier too. The detail is fantastic, looks just like Arpeggio (name of his sitar) and is really high quality. I can't wait to see the look on my girlfriend's face when I give it to her, she's a huge Demyx fanatic, and I'd recommend it to any Demyx/ Kingdom Hearts fan or someone buying a gift for a KH fan.
B008E7POE8|5|Fixed my car
B000I4JPZE|5|Cost effective little gaget. Works great, light weight, easy to store. Beets having to have jack secured some place.<br /><br />Great little item
B000ET5264|2|not very user friendly. hard to get accurate reading. would not recommend.
B0041DY0CG|5|Part was great, friend of mine installed it and he said it was heavy duty compared to the factory and an easy install, looks like I'll be ordering the drivers side soon
B000NWKXRU|4|It's a product that matches it's name - only for polishing. I think some of the videos online refering to this product are very misleading, as it could only polish the car but could do very little about the scratches.
B000HTRNRC|3|sensing bulb is very sensible and it damages very easily
B00316GNYM|5|Works great. Easy to use. I used this for my vehicle stereo system and separate from my charging system.
B004YGRCMA|5|these are very nice
B00I250T88|5|So happy to have found this product - the door insets on my Avalon were getting badly scratched by ring wearers and now they are secure
B0017OGD04|4|thought it was a bit short on the width and length but did the job!
B003UM9GDM|4|I bought this for the foot release. It took a few modifications to make it more suitable for my 2014 HD Street Glide. I ground off the 4 stops on the H component. I didn't want to see them hit the frame. The rubber mats were cut in half and turned around to cover the 4 ends ground off. The bike frame sits just in side of the bolts that holds the 'H' component. So the bike sits pretty level when up. It did have a wiggle that was cured by washers. I placed washers & nuts in between the 'H' component and the riser tubes. This keeps the 'H' component from rotating on the vertical axis. I see I can add pictures. I will add pictures of the modifications later.
B000BUQODG|5|The item arrived in great shape.  It is what I wanted for a replacerment that was broken.  The sell was great on this item.
B000PUSL4W|5|Great Shoe
B00B9EQHFS|1|Made a mess on the black plastic bumpers of our Honda and cannot remove the dumb stuff. Do not bother buying this.
B001418YIE|5|from New Jersey.  I get a kick out of knowing this is on my car and they better watch out!  hahaha
B00SC900WO|4|Solid fix for the rear windows. I did both of mine in my 2000 Tundra. I had some difficulty getting the pin to sit flush during installation, but they work great. Good instructions on youtube as well.
B006CRT72W|4|Very easy to program.
B00BITI8VU|5|perfect fit!!!i wish shipping was faster but was well worth the wait and not to mention price...thanks
B00265FXTA|5|Perfect Bulbs..But I recommend replacing both at same time because the new one will be twice as bright
B007TNLWM6|5|Works perfect for my 2.7T
B002R0ASEE|5|Major discount auto parts retailer wanted 30+$ for each piece. Forget that, I got it here cheap and fast. Go to the local store and take a picture to compare first.
B00CFM9QLA|4|This item is exactly what I wanted, it cleared the clutter from my trunk.  I was able to put loose bottles of oil, windshield washer fluid in it, as well as other small items and I still have room.
B0058U0O1M|5|Parts arrived undamaged. Part installed easily. Very happy with the purchase and arrival time.
B000B6JJUK|5|Excellent
B005XZQH9U|5|Solved my drilled-out, frame mounted, helmet lock issue. Now I simply lock my helmet to my handlebars. Quality of build is better than expected as well. A little on the heavy side but its hardened steel I believe. However, weight is the trade-off for adequate security when it comes to locks.
B004DRU0BU|2|These headlights I ordered were suppose to be the trd smoke grey lights. Instead I got the original looking headlights. Fittment isn't all that great, quality is the same level as the fitttment. For the price and what I was planning to do with them. I guess I can't really complain.
B0096BAQ80|5|Arrived on time and great fit.
B003JJA2KW|1|It's white alright  but not bright enough to see a thing. I don't recommend this suff. I replace it right away.
B000C5CETS|5|This part fits and functions just like the original. Very good replacement cap. High quality. Would purchase again and recommend to others.
B000FFY8VC|4|I've always been a bit skeptical about suction cup items, especially when they're in a car that goes through the extremes of temperatures. I noticed that one of the suction cups has lost it's grip on the window but the other 2 has held it in place. No vibration noises while driving which I was also worried about. We'll see how it holds up after the winter. The summer months will be a true test to see if it ends up on my dash after running into the  super market. Hoping it holds.
B00A2GPPNO|2|Just a flimsy piece​ of rubber.
B00C1YI2XA|5|WOW what a product these lights are amazing they light up my whole block when lit up (lol).  but really they are the best lights i have seen or used in a long time and possibly ever.  i recommend these to anyone looking for  day time running lights they work great during the day in full daylight.  amazing only thing is when they are not on they are yellow in color but the brightness of the light makes that so minor its not an issue.  again great product and would and will buy it again when needed and will recommend it to a friend.
B00068XCQU|5|If you have any piece of motorized equipment that sits unused for any length of time, this is a must for lawn mowers or motorcycles in the winter.
B0096R0JK4|4|Really warm
B00GHT95EK|4|Second one I buy,my other one broke it was my fault lol quality is good just wish the spring had more tension since it won't always bring back the plastic lid into the close position but I think if you just lengthen the spring by stretching it that will help it have more tension.
B001IANSLY|4|Jack works great, although I wish it would traverse faster.
B003V3XA5A|4|A week or two ago we had january temps in the fifties. This was great, since it helped to melt the ten inches of snow piled up at the sides of the road. AND it gave us a chance to clean up the cars. We have a Rogue and a Yaris, and live in the southwestern area of Pennsylvania. I really hate the way dirt and salt and build up on the cars over winter. Due to the nature of our weather, the interior takes a beating as well. We invested in the WeatherTech mats, which help to keep the gravel and salt contained on the floors. I admit to keeping a microfiber cloth in my car to dust the dash, etc. So I was very pleased to be offered Griot's Garage 11262 Interior Kit to try.<br /><br />The Yaris is 6 years old. The Rogue is 2 years old. The Yaris is the car that my husband drives and it gets some hard use. The Rogue less so, but I still like it to look and feel clean. Griot's Garage 11262 Interior Kit did the trick, as far as I'm concerned. I once had the Yaris detailed and it was great! Great, except for the deep scratch across the face of the radio. That cured me of wanting to pay for that again! With Griot's Garage 11262 Interior Kit, all we have to invest is a little time and effort to get similar results. In just an afternoon we managed to clean up the worst of the outside dirt, and give a nice clean look and feel to the interiors. I was extremely pleased, and I will be purchasing this product in the future. It is much less expensive than a detailing, and didn't find the lingering fragrance to be too heavy or offensive. I have an issue with perfumes and fragrances, but this was light and faded quickly enough and didn't cause me any issues.<br /><br />Griot's Garage 11262 Interior Kit provides all you need to get the job done. I have already recommended it to friends and family.
B007XZK0SC|1|They look and feel great for the first couple months, but after a while the edges will curl up and fold, the underside will crack, the carpet will slowly shed, and will ultimately look cheap and tacky.
B00JC75MQE|5|Exact fit! Very satisfied
B00BITPXRM|5|Right fit, easy install (look up how to install on you-tube)  Using a towel to remove the broken old crank worked perfect!  Removed broken handle, installed new handle in less than 5 minutes and I'm an idiot.
B000C55KW6|4|Need special equipment to install. Price was good. Had to have a garage install
B004V3QBS2|3|there are no mounting holes or mounting bracket...your pretty much on your own as far as that is concerned.
B00P9EJGR0|4|not be perfect for the car (size of the seat) but it works
B0040BGSQ0|5|These magnets are very cute. So far no one has stolen them and I sure hope they don't.I love them.
B000BPSW7C|5|I have a car detailing service in Caracas and I used 3M products. When I took a trip to Miami, I took a look around at the products in the U.S. market and tried it. Nu Finish delivers on its promise.
B000IG3JJA|2|It does not built to feet the 2003 Mazda Truck
B0017KOPYO|4|Channel fit my 95 yj perfectly.<br />Not a lot else to say, it is what it is.<br />I had to purchase different screws, included screws were too small for the holes in the channel, no biggie.<br />Overall, a good product, would recommend.
B00CD7EJTG|5|Great fix.
B00BEXVPOW|5|good
B004A2IFII|5|As advertised.
B00CEKWITK|2|The pipes are OK, the hoses are thin and they expand too easily in my opinion.  The clamps are first class, grade A junk.  If I had it to do over I would have only bought the pieces I needed, in a higher quality, individually.
B00KTIODD8|5|product works great
B0084TZIYM|5|exactly what i expected
B00PAMUACQ|5|Fantastic, fits perfectly, and adds a nice touch to my white 2000 convertible.
B007OTH02G|5|does what it was made for. only out here it has faded quickly
B00D8E0SRA|5|Well worth the price, the fuse holder, case, cover and hardware is very solid.  I am very pleased with this purchase and the seller shipped immediately.  Go solar or go home!
B00DBYGGMI|1|I bought this item trying to save some money but ended up wasting it.  I had just installed it and was testing the window positioning when the cable jumped off one of one of the guide wheels.  I cannot recommend this product.
B009X54QJY|5|Good stuff. These are better than Clevitts version. They clear radius better.  I used with King LW SBC crank with Honda journals.
B002VPL6NM|4|I installed these along with the front rotors from ACDelco.  They fit properly and were well finished.  After about 8000 miles the black paint is still holding up well which is a slight appearance benefit.  No warping so far though it is a Jeep, I'm not racing it.  The quality of the finish was good.
B00AYA3Q0M|5|Excellent, saved my ride several times already! Fits well and easy to clean, what more can you ask for!
B008VPEM5K|5|Really nice product with such a cheaper price. If you go to local store they charge $140 or some thing for a single bulb.<br />I replaced this bulb about a couple of months before, the quality is good and don't have any problem with bulbs.
B000E283Y4|5|came very quickly  very heavy duty  high quality  perfect fit  100% satisified...recommend to all...
B00FB3GDXE|5|Yes I love my sine the closet you get the slower I drive. Ppl (people) just need 2 know that when driving be hide me Lol
B009E9L5I4|5|I was able to move my chip over from the old remote & use my new one with no problem & everything worked the way its suppose to!
B0006Z9SQQ|3|Bought this for my 2014 Lexus. It does clean but leaves residue marks around the area, which then i use a microfiber cloth to clean off. I'm sure there are other better products somewhere.
B001MSODHU|5|Great product.
B00MI6GRMY|4|Looks great work great
B008KVT1UQ|4|This should fit a manual shift just fine. Be aware that the automatic shift is M8, and this is M10, so you'll have to find a way to make it fit. I'm still giving it 4 stars though, quality definitely as expected
B00D1GZBT0|5|Perfect. Exactly as described. High Quality Decal.
B00C5CR4CI|5|Easy installation for the diyer!  Good and sturdy; will save my bed for sure.
B007HRHM9G|3|everything looked fine till I placed them on the wheels 3 of them were fine the fourth one turned out to be the wrong size and does not fit .
B0009Y2CFS|1|I hate to write a negative review. If you look at my profile all my other reviews are 5 star. I am a positive person who does not dwell on the negative.<br /><br />That being said, this item is deffective, it does not heat. It takes at least 10 minutes to get any warmth, which is minimal. The blanket is a quality however, but who would pay $25 just for a blanket.<br /><br />I am contacting to get a refund immediately.<br /><br />The best way to describe it is that if a 0 to 10 scale is used with a 0 being a normal blanket and a 10 being so warm that you would unplug it, the item is a 1 out of 10 in warmth. Honest.
B001PYSAGQ|5|great product
B004OD3HCM|4|The perfect replacement for my broken table stand.  All of the holes lined up and the leg fit perfectly.  I hope it lasts just as long or longer than the original.
B0012X0JLE|5|Arrived in a reasonable amount of time.  Better price than anywhere else.  Local places we almost double.  Factory ride is back!
B002XYN8AA|5|Great price ,quick fix.Very easy to replace old harness with this A+.2004 grand prix gt abs and traction light gone.Thanks
B00546IXYK|5|Purchased this hoodie for our 16 year old son. He loves it wears it on a daily bases. It is warm, holds it shape well, and the lining is warm and soft. We are pleased with the quality of this hoodie.
B00A7XY07O|5|A+
B002GZ71AY|1|The first set I ordered came last week.  They were D2S not D2R.  Amazon sent me replacements.  In a Prius, you need to use D2R or D4R as the R indicates it is for a reflector headlight and the lamp has shielding up the sides and around the glass to prevent glare.  The S lamps are typically for projectors which already have a shield in place.  The second set came just like the first, rattling around in the box and even though the box says D2R, they are not, as they have no shielding.  Either someone is swapping out used bulbs, or the factory is sending bad products.  BEWARE.  I had to return both sets since they were not correct and would not stay on, just flickered.  I know the ballast is good as I have an old set of D4S bulbs that I replaced due to the excessive glare and they work fine.  In case you are considering using S instead of R in a reflector headlight like the Prius, the glare is worst in the rain and snow, and it blinds people.
B000KOPMK4|2|The lock in the photo was the one I wanted and thought I was getting since I have two others (models 33 and 35) like it. What I got was the &#34;modern&#34; version with the rolling pin lock rather than the screw pin type. The rolling pin type lock I also had in the past and tends to become stiff with infrequent use, running the risk of locking up. The correct photo and info should have been displayed in the first place.
B002XOXSI2|5|This is a great device that quickly polishes and waxes my car and truck. Very light weight and reliable. I use it in combination with Meguiar's Ultimate series and it works great.
B000KL3E8E|5|If you want to keep your interior looking good - these are a must have!! This is my 4th pair. They are in every car I own<br />and are quickly added as soon as I buy a new one!  Thanks!
B002JUNHKO|5|So far so good.  I'm using it to maintain my huge 8DHC wet cell battery to back-up my sump pump in case of a power failure during the winter rains.
B00KQNKXZI|3|Nice product but there was no instructions for turn signal or brake switch.On a golf cart you don't want the brake lights on all the time it's parked.Had to run separate wire from ignition switch to power brake lights so when the key is off so are the lights.
B006H34AHI|1|Not the same as picture
B00TZF06VO|5|Great cheap fix. This one is a bit more but you won't have to mess with the pins to keep the gear in place.
B00ARJP5G8|5|So far so good quality was great
B000CMD2C4|5|I give this 5 stars because it is a good product for a (Ford). Did not know before ordering, had to return for the right one. This one has the air valves off set, not like the photo. The description says it fits the P-30, P-30 is a Chevy. (The P-30 # is Firestone W237604100 Coil-Rite Kit).
B004WCV1OG|1|Not a very strong scent, or should I say, : &#34;No scent at all.&#34;  Product came opened and was probably that way for a while.
B00ARYTBFY|4|I purchased this produce 3 months ago to do an Audi inspired headlight. They are still stuck on there after 3 months and no leds have burned out. nice bright white color to them.
B0007TQWME|3|tear easily
B003RB2D1S|1|Ok I saw a good review and a bad review. The question is to the good review. Does it actually works for a 96 Honda Accord??
B000H6QWVI|4|My son helped me relocate. This was a big help to assure safe and damage free loading, transport. Strong and durable.
B0059HJKBY|5|Part is well made. Feels  heavy. I use it for specific u joint that requires this end, and also on chainsaw. Very practical.
B000CK0PMQ|2|I purchased two rear wheel cylinders for my 82 Tercel. When I got the items one of them did not have a plug in the line connection and looked like it was previously installed due to the scapes and rust on it. The other unit was like new.
B000X23TKS|5|Fits my 2013 A3 perfectly!<br /><br />It arrived in a couple days.<br /><br />It was exactly what I expected (as advertised).<br /><br />I'm very happy!
B00COTMMOC|2|I have had this cover on my 2015 GMC Denali for over eight months now and it definitely has some issues. When folding twice if you're not careful in the spring holders come out of the track then will put a dent in the first section closest to the cab. The track that the spring holders are supposed to stay in must be too wide. I have attached a picture and it's hard to see but I probably have six marks on each side where the spring holder has dented that first section. Not real pleased.
B000HZT89C|5|Very good
B00J3NPOI8|3|Received tire cover and was surprised how nice it looked for the price. Getting it on the tire was a challenge and I still believe it doesn't fit like it should compared to other covers I looked at on other Jeeps. After 2 weeks after I installed it I noticed the stitching around the cover was coming apart, loose threads. Not happy with the quality but for the $22.00 plus shipping it will work for the time being. I will purchase another one probably through Jeep.
B001EP28JG|5|Love the quality and installed as instructed took 30 mins have installed other hitches over 50 years this was the best one yet
B0018AKFV0|4|Really good
B00FPJKO66|4|design could be better but the concept is great. Plastic exposed to East coast temps Hot humid summer, cold winter...plastic gets brittle and can crack/break. But still good concept
B00BQMKZ4C|5|Very pleased with product. Came just as promised. Installed it the same afternoon and have had no problems with it. One satisfied customer. Thank you.
B006X98A7C|4|Replaced the battery in our APC unit. Much cheaper than buying a new APC unit.
B0000AXTUY|5|Good unit.  I use it to keep a battery for my winch fully charged.  Works well, low cost, highly recommended.
B0083I0Y4I|1|One burnt out after only 2 months.
B004ZF43Y0|5|Very bright and easy to install.
B003V4YUN0|3|Great looking wiper blade and does seem to clear windshield as expected.  The locking clip for the wiper blade will not fit the arm pin on a 98 cadillac Deville.  I had to reduce the width of the locking piece with a grinder to allow for proper seating.
B0009LRB6G|5|Works Great! Used on saddles, belts, sofa and boots. Did great on all. Conditioned and shined! Best leather conditioner I've found in a long time!
B000C2WI7O|4|Nice build with a quality bearing. Easy install. Replaced a hard driven factory idler pulley on a 1998 Honda Civic with 128,000 miles on it. Gates trusted performance.
B00FZ3MYZ6|4|This is my second one...The first one lasted about 80 hours of off-roading...But mine is stuffed with tools and other stuff...I prefer this bag to the other's available as it is streamlined and looks like it is designed for the KTM rear fender unlike the other rear fender bags. However if you stuff it like I do you'll have to replace it from time to time as the bag's seams will start to open which is not a biggie as it sells for 15 to 20 dollars depending on where you buy it...
B00FC7SH9W|5|Perfect fit.  Looks stock.  Drilled and grommetted an additional hole for routing wire for Garmin Nuvi under the included tray.  No wires or crappy tape.
B001UC9GHU|5|good
B0001EW4BI|1|Says in Amazon they fit but they do not. The front were fine.  These folks should update the description to avoid single stars in the future.
B00G6H2WVQ|3|Great lights, easy to install. However they are not as bright as I imagined them to be. Seen brighter
B000BQWHDQ|5|I bought the Camco 39651 RV HTS 20' Super Heavy Duty Sewer Hose and Camco 39173 RV Easy Slip Straight Hose Bayonet Adapter and Camco 39144 RV Easy Slip Elbow and 4 in 1 Adapter.  Super simple, high quality, and no leaking for 2 years now. All but the 4-in-1 adapter fits in the square bumper nicely. Camco makes the best stuff in my opinion. Brilliant. I am leaving the same review on all 3 parts mentioned here.
B000KQ4J0Q|5|Couldn't be happier. Installation was a breeze, they deflect the air as they say.
B00450I2MY|1|Boot ripped within 1000 miles.....now it will have to be changed again as it is full of dirt.
B003U2IKWK|5|Great
B0053ZJD1O|5|I've bought decals online before and gotten product that's just a little bit off.  You know you're taking a gamble when you order online, but you hold your breath and hope for the best.  This looks beautiful and colorful and it stuck perfectly with no bubbles, although I like to think that was due to my decal applying prowess...
B00D6H6XU0|5|Just what I was looking for
B0030NO5SC|5|So far so good. Irs staying on well so far. And it looks nice too.
B001I0O2G4|5|I love my new Hello Kitty floor mats for my car. They are very sturdy and since I love Hello Kitty these are perfect for me. Couldn't find anything like this in any store.
B000IY9UP4|5|Simple installation, and works excellent.  Easy to remove old worn supports, and a snap to install new ones.  Use some caution to support the hood when removing old supports.
B00JID6RXY|5|a1
B001C6GQPY|4|Only two of four holes on the hitch and frame rail lined up, so drilling is required. An overall quality product.
B000WG9PJY|5|Used this on my 1994 Dodge Dakota 4x4 front disk brake caliper & it was quick, easy & better than new.
B00KMBPA9I|5|These light will be greay on my motorcycle
B00REE0LHC|1|It is very cheaply made. Mine came and looked like it rolled around in the ground for a while because it had scratches all over it.
B00796KI5U|5|the best
B005JL35XE|5|I am a junior high teacher at a Christian school. This sticker is stuck to the metal door of my classroom. It reminds me that grace should be granted to all who enter. Good quality.
B00AL1KK9Y|5|This was a gift to a friend. He really liked it and was excited to go camping. Thanks so much.
B004AIHNM6|4|works great
B00I9EIAFQ|1|Doesnt stick well
B000760FWU|4|Works fine. Instructions warn that these are to be used only for leveling, and not for supporting the weight of the RV. Unfortunately, our parking space is on a slope, so leveling it requires supporting quite a bit of weight. So far, so good, but I'd be more comfortable with a heavier duty jack stand.
B001B8H0YE|5|I only have experience with the zmax trans formula so I can't vouch for their other products but the zmax trans formula is fantastic. My car started shifting very rough and I saw the zmax formula for only 10 bucks. Seconds after putting it in, the trans started shifting like a brand new car! It's so smooth I don't even feel the car shift anymore. For 10 bucks you will not find a better product for your transmission.
B00DZY439M|4|Have in use for over a month and are working well. I have them in fence mounted down lights so the bulb is protected somewhat from elements.  The light is not fully warm white but not blueish either. I would recommend
B00EI6CKVE|5|Very cute and easy to put on.  Took my husband like 5 minutes to get it set up.  Love it.
B002EO5SHK|2|I was so excited to get this product, at first. I received the product in good shape from UPS just one problem. After hours with tech support and 3 hours taking the bolt off the truck the company had stated would work. It became apparent If you have a 1004 Ford Ranger Standard cab this will not work for you/ The mounts are to short and the bolts are not long enough. There is no way to get these on the truck with the included equipment. I even checked with My local body shop and they also could see no way to mount these.
B0087R20KG|5|Fit my four wheel with no problems,nice solid assembly!! Fast ship
B004HZREI0|4|We have a 110lb American Bulldog and a 2010 Nissan Maxima- it kept him in the backseat. He tried to rest his big ole head on it a few times but he stayed in the backseat and it stayed attached to the seats. Would rather have it than not. Good purchase and pretty good design, seems durable.
B00NRVBKI0|5|I had to buy a anti flicker warning canceller for my GMC Terrain once this was put in no issues. Lights look  amazing
B0050VGZLM|2|These were a disappointment. We hooked them all up and within a day two of them were beeping constantly. A few weeks later and now they're all beeping constantly. It may be that the batteries are low and need to be changed but if that's the case, it would have been great if they didn't come with dead batteries.
B009ET15P2|5|My order arrived on time and they are installed in the wife's vehicle. They are made with great quality and look great. I would recommend them to anyone.
B0002X520S|5|this product is amazing. hard to describe how excellent it is.<br /><br />i've used other similar products but none are nearly as good (eg dubbin)<br /><br />Tips: Apply to new shoes immediately. Don't wait for shoes to get dirty dusty or stained<br /><br />use cedar wood shoe trees to maintain shape of shoe or boot<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />Smells nice<br />Applies easy (just use bare fingers to rub on)<br />absorbs well into the leather<br />really protects well<br />makes leather softer/ more supple<br />darkens light tan shoes (which is nice)<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />none.
B002QA386A|3|Not as bright as I expected it to be.  I ordered six of these for my landscape lights, four were cool white, two were warm white.  That's not how I ordered it, but I made it work, because I didn't want to deal with returning them.
B000EA5WLS|4|worked fine for me I had success now I can see so much better out of my window good investment it was well worth the money I think highly suggest you use this and try to see if it can get rid of those annoying scratches.
B003LS768M|2|Poor quality and there is very little support for your back.
B008MM0Q34|5|Love it!  Just adds a little something to the vehicle.
B003UFGDR6|1|Although Amazon identifies  this to fit a jeep wrangler 08 sahara unlimited, it does NOT.  This is for a 04-06 jeep rubicon.
B000DZFMUA|2|The box didn't include all of the parts.  It was missing some plastic end caps for the metal bars.  When I called the company, they said they don't have that part so I guess that explains why it's not in the box.  Doesn't affect the way it works but is annoying.<br /><br />The assembly was not easy.  I ended up calling a handyman and he put it together.<br /><br />It didn't work the best on my Honda Civic because the roof is slightly curved.  The unit is designed for a flat roof carr.
B001PY43EE|5|New return springs surprised me..Although it was only one side.
B008F8Q86E|5|nice & clean very good
B00852MK30|5|Really made mounting some CREE LED lights on my off road golf cart easy. These brackets are heavy duty and would easily support a larger light than what I am using.
B002LGULBO|4|Fits nice but don't seal real good
B00OJOYKEK|5|Happy with this item. Works great, looks great, and seems to be of good quality.
B00BFDFL1Y|5|It was easy to replace just these rubber wipes.  One does have to remember to assemble them back the exact way they came together.  Once back on the vehicle,  they performed just as expected for much less $$$.  Recommended highly.
B000VU7NL8|5|Bought it for my 2014 GMC and it fit perfectly. Well worth the money.
B00NCCWD62|5|A definite improvement over original bulbs. Much much brighter.  Easy to install
B000OZSABW|3|Wish it fit better, but at least something is on the plastic to keep it from falling apart. Thanks anyway!
B0057OC9B2|2|I got this product as a birthday gift.  I don't know why because I personally don't have any vehicles with plastic headlights.  However, I did use this product on my mother's and my sister's vehicles.  On my mothers vehicle it did a fairly good, not great but good, it was still foggy but I could actually see the bends of the chrome and the light bulb inside/behind the plastic lens.  For my sister's vehicle, that's another story. Although it did clean up the headlights, on one headlight you could not really see the bulb or the lines of the inside behind the plastic area very well, it was very blurry.  One lens did not clean up very much at all and although you could see it was cleaner, you could not make out ANYTHING behind the clear plastic lens.  It was just one big clear-ish like blur.  I thought maybe I did something wrong because of the videos on this product I watched but I didn't, but I did try to use it three times after that on the lenses for both vehicles and there was no visible change to what I saw the first time.  So I used tooth paste and buffed it in on the 5th and 6th try's and then buffed them out and that actually worked better.  So from now on I am using tooth paste, and you only need the amount that you would use to brush your teeth with for each lens.  Which makes it even cheaper to use.  I must say however, it will take a little bit more work to use toothpaste but it will work better than this product.  I gave this a 2 star because it actually did 2 star quality of lenses cleaning.  Toothpaste gets a 5 Star.
B006M9VIRM|5|I haven't road tested these yet but they were easy to install and the instructions were detailed and exact. They are very flexible for width and the height was perfect right out of the box for our Winnebago Sightseer. We have a 2&#34; rise and 4&#34; drop to accommodate our bike rack and tow bar. Mounted on the bike rack and inserted into the 2&#34; rise receiver worked perfect.<br /><br />The security type star fastners were a bit of a pain when the provided tool broke, fortunately I had an exact fit. Despite the cheap throw away star wrench, all of the hardware seemed to be very high quality stainless steel.
B00192MUJM|5|Fit great. Good quality. Looks just like factory and same brand hose as what come from the dealer.  If these last as long as original that will be great.
B008DWQE5W|5|bought 3 sets, Sonota used 2 and Elantra has 1.  Tight fit inside lamp housing (Hyundai fault), pigtails work very well!
B008KPYDD2|5|I have a arctic cat predator and this fits top to bottom and is very snug. Stayed on and kept machine nice and dry through many winter storms.
B006BBHEJW|5|My favorite scent & lasts the longest out of all the car fresheners out there!!
B000WEMH4G|5|Easy to install and great looking. Fast shipping.
B00CDO9MAA|5|i bought these for my 2013 Kia Optima SXL- took me a few minutes to figure out which way they went on, but once I got that figured out- took me all of 10 minutes to wash and dry the area and put them on. Added a great sharp look to my car. they work great in the rain- i had my windows open all day driving in the rain and not 1 drop got in my car. HIGHLIGHY recommened these
B001QVFD4K|5|Adam's Detail Spray is sensational. It has wax in it, just like SmartOne (clay & wax?) and is in same league as Poorboys waterless spray and wipe. One reviewer wrote (in gallon size ad) that 2 meguiars products were better. That is totally ridiculous, IMHO. That is like saying Camaros are better than Porsches. Adams is custom made for top quality, and grabs loyalty of picky home detailers who care deeply about their vehicles looks and protection. Meguiars is pretty much mass produced... their products are decent, but in this category, Adams has the goods.<br /><br />It goes on smelling like cherry, very smooth application, and slick to touch. On glass you can see a little streaking sometimes, but that just means it hasn't been buffed with clean cloth for an extra one minute. I live near ocean, so cars are often bearing moisture in morning, and Adams seems to work quite well with a moderate amount of water. Product is totally worth the money, and goes a long ways.
B007YG24U2|2|Not very easy to work with. The wiring is extremely thin and easy to cut through. The wires easily short out and melt as well.
B0002L67YA|5|Awesome
B0046ZIW0U|5|This exhaust is not too loud, which was my main concern. I was also was worried it would sound like a fart can. Quite the opposite, the exhaust is a low pitched noise that has a tiny bit drone in the cabin on the freeway, but trust me when I say you get used to it.<br />The only thing was when I put it on it wasn't center, just had to adjust it a little.
B0009I1WXW|4|The cover took a few weeks to get but it seems like any other cover I have bought in the past. The material may be a little thinner but it still has a great 3 year warranty so we will see how it holds up in the California sun and wind. It came with one of the zippers broken but we never use them anyway. I would wait to see how long it lasts before recommending it to a friend.
B00QTIAPMU|5|Makes my car look complete.
B00C25GRI0|4|IT WAS FINE, HAD A DIFFERENT PROBLEM REASON IT WAS RETURNED, GREAT SERVICE.
B009W85T66|4|Was what I expected for the price, it is what it is, a good made, low cost seat cover for an older vehicle
B00GYY2OVE|5|Product was delivered and worked perfect
B000GVAAVM|5|excellent pegs,well made,strong,comfortable
B002XYJJTY|5|had a problem with shipping because of bad weather.  jdk auto parts went above and beyond to fix the problem. I am very happy with<br />how they handled the problem. I would recommend anyone to deal with them.
B0041UNXDQ|3|There is 1 wiper in this package. I am not sure why it says \\"set of 2\\" in the description.
B00KWDR7K6|5|It worked perfectly.
B00B2B4D4A|5|Great product came with everything as described. For the Budget Jeeper this kit comes with everything needed to the cheaper version of this kit does not come with the track bar brackets... these help keep the axle centered under the jeep with the lift.... splurge a little and bye this kit with the brackets it will save your jeep in the long run.<br /><br />I installed all by myself. Directions are enough to get the job done. (I have a mechanic background so it was simple for me). Easiest if you have help but if in doubt at all have a pro install it.<br /><br />Now that it is installed. .. the ride is great. It feels a little stiffer than stock. It have my rig a great stance leveled out front and rear. (Front block is 2.5 rear is 2 inches.) Om still running stock size tires and it looks great..<br /><br />Thank you amazon for providing a solid product at a great price in a timely manner. I received this two days before estimated
B00BQTYZC8|5|Fitted great
B004C6S1S6|2|This might be because I am uneducated in such things, but I bought this for my wife's Ford Escape, not a big car, and it was too small...weird I know.  So I assume its a great product, just be aware that its the average size, its tiny.  For like a bike rack attached to a Geo Metro kind of small.
B000JZZS3U|1|Started rattling after a week. Amazon sent me a replacement. Same thing, started rattling after a week. The manufacturer then sent me a replacement. So far so good. Not fun changing mufflers.
B00FDQPCR2|5|Had no external power in one area of our house. Was a lot of work to run an outside outlet. But this motion light fix that issue. Works great and is very bright.
B00B5KYSK2|5|Fits very well, and is a SUPER alternative to purchasing a new armrest lid.  The shorter staples did not go through the fabric INTO the plastic well, especially where I had folded/gathered it, so I wound up using my own staples.
B009LOO1DS|5|Awesome!!
B003RMWWCC|5|I bought this to use in front of my sinks behind my bar. This is heavy duty and can withstand water. I love it and reccomend for others.
B002P8KRT4|5|Extremely happy! Husband installed this on our Saturn Ion in a matter of minutes after I ripped the original one off while pulling out of the garage to go to work one morning! Looks and works just as great as the original! Highly recommend!
B005FMF5RQ|5|OEM visor is exactly what I purchased.There are a lot of imitations out there that do not come close to quality that Shoei makes.Get what you pay for.Very happy.
B0024NSP76|5|Easy install. Looks 100 times better than the old fogged up lights.
B002OUMVWY|4|I purchased this at a dealer so I over-paid for it, but it has worked great for two seasons.  I love how it collapses to a fraction of it's total length.  Also the sewer end screws in to most inlets at the parks we've camped at.  It does disfigure if you step on it, however...but I've never had a leak.  It's been very reliable.  For $30 it's a bargain !!
B001KOBBAS|5|Very easy to install & no vibration & very clear while riding.
B003BZIN1O|5|I was concerned because the other reviews were for the 2006 Cooper-S, not the base model, but I needn't have feared.  I took the blade out of the package and it snapped right in.  A perfect fit.  As an added bonus, it woks too!  It's like magic!
B00DAJFJRC|3|The color is still not the gold it may seem in the picture, but they sent me a brand new one with the right size this time. sticking it to the clear paper was hard to do, and the size is a little bigger than the cover size but its an okay product.
B00TEA5PZC|4|Came a little twisted, but nice frame as it matches chrome but should be more durable
B0093N7NTG|5|Worked perfectly for 2007 ford edge awd
B00BCRMAQC|4|They fit ok for my 2010 Toyota prius especialy since its red!! A little trouble putting them together but it seems ok nice ;)
B0036ULEV0|4|Works well, seems well made.
B0000AYJOI|3|still working after 20 hours, not exactly as pictured but a cheaper version and no cut out template provided.
B0000AYJOI|5|The meter installed in boat very easily without any problems.  Appears  to be working very well.  No problems to date.
B000EVYGZA|5|Very nice meter for the price.  Works well for automotive trouble shooting as well as work around the house.  It would be nice if it came with a case as well as alligator clips.  Overall a great buy.
B000C3F366|3|should have got the bigger one
B0050M33WU|5|I looked in all the stores in Tulsa for a good leather jacket and couldn't find anything so I looked on Amazon and found what looked like exactly what I wanted and it Really was!!! It's the first thing I've ever ordered online and I will definitely do it again. A little advise, order it one size larger than you normally wear. But it's great!! Not too heavy and very well made.<br />Thanks Amazon,<br />Tina
B00JW1VX0O|5|Easy replacement and actually increased the range I had with the factory remote.
B002DZV86A|5|I purchased Griot's Garage Spray-on car wash on a recommendation of a auto enthusiasts forum I follow.<br /><br />Speed shine has almost no scent, provides good cleaning and is easy to work with.  Its spray trigger (sold separately) delivers a generous even spray of liquid.  Because it is a generous spray the solution is used fairly fast. I think I will be able to get 4-5 washes out of it.  I use micro fiber towels (a big bag I purchased at Costco) and in combination with Griot's spray-on car wash they provides an excellent cleaning in fairly quick time.<br /><br />I enjoyed working with it. Thumbs up overall!<br /><br />Ali Julia review
B0025OUD1A|1|Unfortunately this did not fit a 96 avalon.  The bolt holes line up, but the filler neck is about 2 inches too short.
B000NGIPP8|4|Did not use these much as had a plastic set too and used them much more. These will mark up stuff and scratch paint as metal so use common sense and thus why I am also not knocking them much. Not really needed for a basic stereo install probably. More for prying but perhaps needed for other tasks.
B004A1UNQ6|5|This reservoir arrived very quickly (which is a good thing because the leak in the old one had grown worse), was super easy to install (my husband had it done in minutes), and had all of the parts as advertised.  The price was also very good, and it is still functioning properly, so we are really satisfied with this purchase!
B0083V510W|4|Rv window was as described, Fit perfectly and was easy to assemble. Shipping was done right away and received when told.
B00029WSWC|5|I have had mine more than a year. Eliminates blind spots. Also my family loved them as their Christmas gifts.
B0097SVS6Q|5|Fit well, work great.
B005M1R5UA|5|I use this on my Glock 19. It seems to be the same lube that Glock uses on their pistols......
B001EOWQP8|5|I bought this to fit my Ford Superduty which uses the larger 2-1/2\\" receiver.  Had to use a mallet to get it in, but as I never remove it, I prefer it to be a tight fit.  There is zero slop with this hitch mount.
B00B8X7T66|5|Exact fit fixed the issue. Many thanks.
B00CT2YDLE|2|wrong filter for the car I own
B002LZBMSG|2|I actually wouldn't recommend it... Floor mats are fine! Not too awesome but nothing really to complain about, steering wheel cover gets really hot but manageable, the seat covers are terrible. They already don't for very well and they begin to rip all across the seat, both of them. Wouldn't really recommend for the price. They did deliver quick.
B000FPYEUC|5|The Staun deflators are smaller than I expected. They will take a 31&#34; wrangler duratrac from 35psi to 15psi in 3 minutes. Plan on spending 15 to20 min to set up with some trial an error to get you desired pressure. The pouch that came with the deflators is actual leather and not some cheep vinal look-a-like.
B00800IM0W|3|The first one I returned as the one flange did not seal right. The second was the same. As I could not afford further delay, I welded this pipe to the Benchmark BEN3002D pipe (welded the two flanges together to get them to seal properly. Used new Subaru gaskets so that was not the problem.The problem was with this pipe not the other one. You could visibly see that the flange was not flat causing the sealing issue. Used new Subaru gaskets so that was not the problem. I work on cars regularly including building street rods and customs so I know how to properly install exhaust pipes. Once welded everything worked properly.
B00FSE7T0M|5|I got these for my brother and he loves them
B00FDQPCR2|2|Never has worked well.
B002JR949K|5|Works great - know there are TWO in the order which I didn't know.  I almost ordered 2 which would have given me 4 visors :)
B00HJEGQQ2|5|Great
B0002MBBIQ|4|Good for lightweight strapping, did not work for tying down motorcycles. It was bending the bed rail.
B00EXGRRJE|5|excelente
B000GOJW9K|5|Works great on my 2004 Honda Odessey
B0018EW0JQ|2|Good chain but it is too short... I wish it is a bit longer :(<br /><br />Oct, 26, 2015: update:  I am not impressed with this cable lock. The rubber outside is too thick and the metal inside is very thin, which is easier to cut it with a cutter. There are so many good options out there and I DO NOT recommend this cable lock at all..<br />Poor product
B0031ZDU62|3|Very inexpensive. Does not come with silicone grease. The car runs so now I have to see if they go 80000 miles like the $240 set they replaced did.
B00C253U1M|3|Pros: looks good, materials are decent quality, pretty good build for the price<br /><br />Cons: bulky, it didn't fit under the seat compartment of my Vespa
B0002KKISM|4|its  a wonderful Product,
B00F4MQJ5O|5|This thing is freaking awesome so far. I put it on my 2010 wrangler. I bought rough country mounts and it was a tight fit, but I made it work. SO this thing is so dang bright. It was snowing the other week and I turned it on and it looked like I was jumping into hyper space. also I don't advocate doing this but if someone is flashing you with there high beams and you hit them with this thing,  its like getting slapped in the face by the hand of god. so bright and just awesome. I hope it holds up!
B000C9LU8A|5|great item
B000SZX9AU|1|I know that reviews are always written by people who are either very happy, or very not about their purchase.<br />Just attempted to put on my new car cover for my car that is 210 inches long.  (I measured a few different ways, and even added an inch or two for human error.)<br />The car cover was not even close.  I pulled, and stretched the cover thinking I was doing something wrong, it's a new cover, etc., but to no avail.<br />Finally after a good tug at the front corner, the whole thing just ripped at the seam.<br />Done.  I ripped it, so I am not asking for my money back, but the fit was off by ten inches at least, making this car cover fit cars a little over 200 inches.  So the item description is off by about three feet!  Check and check again before buying any cover.
B004TRKBOK|5|Great tool to keep in your car. I bought two, one for me and one for my parents to keep in their car. A must have in case of an emergency.
B000BNMOO6|5|Exactly what I wanted at a very good price
B001NAQTTW|5|A lot of people are not in tune with their bike, so they don't notice the little differences too much.  I was able to feel a difference with this filter.  My only complaint about installing this filter would be the sealing surface.  However, it should be noted that Triumph set up the airbox very weird on the Sprint ST 1050s.  I used a thin little smear of RTV to ensure a perfect seal and down the road she goes.  The beauty of RTV is that you can roll it right off when it comes time to clean the filter and re-install it.
B00HT2Y7ZG|5|Car smells fresh, not like dog anymore!
B000FPZZ4G|1|Did not fit 1980 cj5
B001DCIPCE|5|As the title says, you don't need to purchase a gasket separately. I got this part today and it comes with TWO gaskets.<br />I gave it five stars but I haven't installed it yet so this rating is based on visual appearance and the supplied gaskets only.
B000N3W8J0|4|Very simple product for a simple purpose, and they fit snugly inside a standard 12 inch bucket from your local orange box hardware store.<br /><br />Overpriced for what they are, but they do get the job done.  Finger holes in the center of the guard are a nice touch, otherwise I would think they would be impossible to remove.  (I'm guessing they figured that one out on an earlier revision of the product)
B001T6VM88|4|I bought this plate to put on my husband's truck. I know he will love it once he sees it.  It's very heavy; at least a few pounds.  The only thing I'm concerned with is somebody trying to steal it.  I'm working on putting on some extra secure screws and lock washers.
B0007N20GM|4|The holder fits my \\"legacy\\"-sized PA EZ-pass snuggly and the suction cups stick well to my windshield. Would recommend this product functionally. Only downside is the black color clip is slightly distracting and brings attention to itself. I would have preferred a clear-colored clip instead, but am happy with the way this one works.
B002PYBZJO|2|disappointed, not like in the pictures  just to see and delete codes  but it was all I needed to do
B000W0WSPI|5|You will pay a few bucks for this tool, and you'll use it for about two minutes while you smack a crescent wrench with a hammer, but if you DON'T buy it, by the time you're two hours into trying to take the fan and fan clutch assembly off the front of the water pump, you'll WISH you had bought this tool.  It is well constructed and does the job it is advertised to do - nothing more, nothing less.  How much is your time worth?  If your time is valuable buy the tool and save time and your knuckles.
B00G5JC40E|3|I was very pleased with my new key
B00KO7C66U|4|Looks nice on my car
B000B8N3MS|4|needs a hanger so you dont lose it.
B0010E00T6|5|Works better then the original honda provides
B000C57MWC|1|I honestly dont leave reviews in general but after the time i put into these struts i decided to tell my story.<br /><br />I purchased a pair for my mercedes benz c230 2007 and was extremely disappointed with the quality of these shocks! I toke my car to a mechanic and he installed them on my car in one day. The first couple of days the car felt extremly stiff and heard alot of knocking sound. I called my mechanic and he said give it another 500 ~ 1000 miles for the shocks to break in. A week later i put another 1200 miles on my car and they start squeeking like no other. The car felt out of balance on ramps and turns. I would hear the crackling and squeeking like it was a 1976 car. This was one of the worst investment i have made. I tried to contact MONROE and there service is disgusting. They said i would have to pay labor to take them off my car again and send them to there warehouse to be checked and wait 2 - 3 weeks. thats if i can leave my car at the shop for 2 - 3 weeks. then if found defective they will send me replacment which will take another week for amazon to ship them to me. It cost me $800 for labor to replace my old ones and now pay another $800 again to take them out and wait 4 weeks. It was just a nightmare i would NOT RECOMMEND ANY ONE TO PURCHASE ANY MONROE products not just for the BAD QUALITY but for there horroble unreasonable fake disgusting life-time warranty!<br /><br />Sensa-crap stuts.
B001KOBGP8|5|Great mirrors for the price, they arrived quick and so far no complaints.
B005N6YWRS|5|My new favorite shirt
B00192SK50|5|first one I ordered was wrong I didn't put full description in
B0002T8FIS|5|best I have ever used nice shine
B0007LEG2K|5|Very easy to use code reader with book of codes makes it easy to diagnose problems.
B001DCJ3IY|5|So far I'm impressed with the quality and operation of these hood struts! They are at least equal to OEM struts. Would recommend this item!
B008VJA7FU|5|Great quality, good connections
B0068ER2RQ|5|Really, it's car part porn. Very well made, and man does it cool. I'm running it in front of a cammed 5.3L Vortec in an S-10 pickup and you can really feel the temperature drop across this thing. The hot side is HOT, and the cool side is luke warm. I'm running a dual-fan Summit unit for air motivation and it fit perfectly over this radiator. I wish it came with a cap, but Amazon sells the appropriate cap for this.
B00FRHOLK6|5|These blades are great. Had a set of these on my last car and couldn't be more pleased. They were easy to install on my car, they come with whatever you need,  and I'm expecting then to last a long time. The vendor I got then through on Amazon had a great price and I received them fast.
B00NE33KES|5|Awesome product.  The color chart is spot on.  I usually get the 6k for the hid upgrades I do but these were completely white so i went up to the 8k and still just barely hint of the blue tint and much brighter than the hid upgrades.  I put these in my 2013 camaro and in my 2010 corvette.
B00O25WTLM|4|It serves it's purpose but suction cup keeps falling off
B004ME11FS|5|Exactly what I expected.  I have used these before.  Sad to say that the fittings are not as sturdy as they might be and don't always seal completely.  But a minor inconvenience.
B004XACFK6|4|Wish they were in blue and white then we would have ordered more<br />possibly for our whole department as we are volunteers and it always comes down to cost
B000C16XOE|2|It says it fits my 03 Chevy Cavalier but the track that attaches to the glass is about 4 inches too long and the pieces that go through the holes at the bottom of the glass will not reach.  It was easy enough to swap the track from my original part with the track on this replacement.
B000FPXVV0|1|This was a huge disappointment.  It was difficult to put on and almost impossible to zip.  If there was a 1/2 star that would be too much.  I was really looking forward to the clean look that a cover would provide.  Maybe next time.  Oh the packaging was appropriately sized and protected the product well.
B0091XUAY8|1|kinda cheeply made  I guess you get what you pay for  should send them back wish I had looked at other feed back before i bout them
B001DCJ3RA|5|I bought two of these to replace 2 struts on a 2004 Honda Odyssey that I bought used a few days ago.  While the original struts were still working, the plastic end-pieces had broken off-- so when the rear cargo door was opened too high, the struts became detached and could easily have caused the trunk to fall on my head.  Here are the steps I took for installation:<br />1.  Gathered supplies: two struts, flathead screwdriver.<br />2.  Watched a youtube video of installation (typed in &#34;strongarm strut odyssey&#34; to find relevant videos- tons to choose from)<br />3.  Got a step ladder from the garage to hold up the rear cargo door.  If you have another person around to help, that makes it even easier.  Do not attempt to change the struts without having some help to hold up the door- if it falls on you it'll hurt.<br />4. Used the flathead screwdriver to pry up a small metal band that was securing the bottom of the strut to the cargo door.  After seeing a youtube video, this was really easy to find and do.<br />5. Popped off the metal band (which was open at one end, like a &#34;c&#34;) and then pulled the old strut off the a ball-like hinge in the car (it kinda looked like a hip and socket joint, like one you'd find in your body)<br />6. Repeated the process with the top fastener.<br />7. Got the new strut and installed it by again using the screwdriver to hold back the band so I could push the parts together (and then removed the screwdriver tip to let the band tighten and hold the strut in place.  I put the thicker part of the strut on top (as I was installing it)-- so when the back door is closed the thicker part of the strut will be closest to the floor.  You can go to the strongarm webpage to see a picture of how it looks installed.<br />8. Repeated for top of strut.<br />9.  Then repeated for the entire other side.<br /><br />The whole installation took about 4 minutes.<br /><br />The only complication was that I had to turn one of the attachments on one of the struts about 180 degrees so I could attach it.  The second strut I bought was already perfectly aligned.  It was a little hard to move the part that needed to be rotated, but brute force did the trick.<br /><br />I am not a handy person but I was able to do this entire project easily and with no stress.<br /><br />And now I don't need to worry about the trunk door crashing down on my head, either.
B00651BWPU|3|None of the delivered adapters fit.
B002P8DBGU|4|The installation was easy enough for someone with even limited abilities BUT the electrical connector did not fit the factory connector and the wires required to be cut and spliced to the old connector
B002GO77SG|5|Installation was very straightforward. You need to remove two 18mm bolts that are already bolted onto the car. These will require a bit of force to loosen. Then you install the two 19mm bolts that come with the hitch. Installation is very straightforward.<br /><br />The hitch looks the best out of everything on the market. This one is made of rounded tubular steel, which looks much cleaner and smoother on the car than the standard square stock that other hitches are made of. It also fits very snugly under the rear bumper, so it looks very neat.
B004QJLP5A|5|worked as stated made the  scratches from a bad wiper blade vanish. A very good product
B002E58JPW|5|looked several places, Amazon had for cheapest price, Reviews were correct an excellent direct replacement no issues during install looks identical to original.
B0067UB8T4|1|Well I bought this distributer cap. It was supposed to fit a 1993 ford festiva. But when I got it, it was wrong. It almost fit but it was too wide and the screw holes didn't line up properly. Unfortunately it would cost too much to return it to make it worth while. I would suggest going to a part store and getting parts. I went to autozone and got the right one.
B0000AXF21|5|We ordered these as they have heavy bases, more likely to stand up to the wind out here. They seem sturdier than the older triangles we have.
B0013FT6SI|5|Easy replacement fit was great
B00GP1HKQK|3|Have not tried the part as yet but i looks like what i need.
B003SZ89Y8|5|It arrived quickly, fit, and worked.  All for a good price.<br /><br />It was not exactly the same as the original part, but close enough.  I had to remove the electrical tape holding the cable to the motor in order to route the cable the same way it had originally been routed.  The replacement did not include the snap-in cable holders, but I salvaged them from the old part.  I also had to re-use the old foam sleeve for additional padding to stop the upper cable from rattling.  No problems really, it was just a bit different.
B0009IBJE4|5|Battery chargers and I have never gotten along.  I actually once sold, what turned out to be, a perfectly good old snow plow truck because I thought something serious was wrong with the engine.  The charger showed the battery was good, so I figured it had to be the engine and it was too old and rusty to put more money into it.  The guy came to pick it up,  gave me $200...stuck a new battery in it, and drove it away.  It was a bad charger not a bad battery.<br /><br />Recently, using what I thought was a  more reliable charger, I couldn't get my batteries to fully charge.  Rather than blaming the batteries this time, I purchased the Schumacher.  I read good things about the brand on the web and took the plunge.  I couldn't be happier.  This is a hi-tech charger with all the bells and whistles.  It is \\"stupid proof\\" as well, and lets you know what is going on as it charges. I love it!  I am now able to fully charge all my batteries, and the other charger went into the trash.  I highly recommend this automatic speed charger.
B002BELP3Y|4|Soft enough not to scratch the surface, but clears the water well.
B009DIWCDS|3|The subaru is a little loader.  No directions, hope I put it in correctly.
B00464M2IO|4|This backrest definitely improves the look of the top case which looks pretty plain from up front. It comes with easy to use paper pattern for drilling the mounting holes. It doesn't add much comfort depending on the size of the passenger when mounted on a 2014 Yamaha FZ1 with a SW-Motech Alu-Rack. This is due to the case sitting a little far forward. I am still very happy with my purchase though.
B00KNZS9V4|1|I have been e-mail them. These remotes will not work. My son who is a auto tech for 30 years has been trying to trying to make them work on my car and they will not do it. I have notified them and they have said that I must take them take them to  a Chevrolet Dealer. I had purchased one from<br />Batteries Plus before I realized that they were available from Amazon and he programmed that one with no problem. So far they have<br />not responded. about returning what is apparently a faulty product
B000E28MTU|5|This filter is one of the best. The nut on the end makes it very easy to get off when changing.
B0009IK5VW|4|The wiper blades were fine. Installation took a few minutes as the instructions were a little generic and not specific to my automobile. Shipping was very quick.
B007KCNBB6|5|All is ok Thanks
B001PPHOU8|5|Upgrade to my '05 WRX.  Seems to be built well, and it dresses up the engine bay nicely! ;)
B000K0A5MS|5|Two dealers said cabin filters were never installed...after 10 years...you can actually smell the clean air. Easy replacement already comes with the clips...<br />Make sure you install both filters at the same time...they have interlocked slots...the hardest part is removing all those screws from the glove box...brutal...they need to learn from Hyundai (two plugs and a hingle clip)
B000JFHNG0|5|Bought these gauges to charge 1988 Jeep Cherokee that was refit for R-34. It needs a charge every spring it seems and this is a perfect set to do just that. I'm a some what skilled amateur that doesn't want to have toi replace the compressor but need to keep the woman of the house happy. Have to take care of her 3rd child you know.
B00DC9C19O|3|Works but a couple of LEDs will go in and out. Sometimes they all work but everyone once in ahwile it will flicker or have some LEDs missing. These are cheap though but would have liked them to function a littke better than they do. Probably would get a better brand if I were to do it again.
B00SDEX84K|5|always the best k and n
B002SW4VLW|5|It works very well, holds a charge for a long time, and is nice and light -- easy to maneuver when you need to get into an engine (they place batteries in weird places these days!)  Just wish it had an air compressor -- then it would be perfect!
B0072UQ0EG|5|It took 15 minutes to install and I love them.
B00CD58I8Q|5|I was missing this spring and needed it. They had it, got it quick, it fit. Good stuff.
B00L29BTMQ|4|I read some reviews that raised concerns over the fitment and the quality of the filter material.  The filter I received fit my 2002 Camry perfectly and the filter material was just fine.  The filter I replaced was full of crud.  The new filter really helped improve the circulation.
B004W97DWI|4|Would have given 5 stars but the holes where the reverse light bulbs go are not as they should be. The light sockets would not fit and lock into place. The brake light and turn signal fit perfectly , plug and play just as advertised, but I had to modify the holes for the reverse lights just to get them in.Would have been nice if it had came with bulbs also. Other than the one major issue I would recommend. Shipped and received very fast...
B004I0XBUY|5|fit well just like original, didnt need to replace blind nuts at all<br />would buy again if I needed to
B001A1NBJU|4|They look nice and fit well. The only issue is that they scratch pretty easily.  The double sided tape to hold in place lasted only 3 months but does not change positioning much
B0041TS6IY|3|I recently had to buy the passenger side mirror and that one was way easier than when I got this one. I have had it for about 3 yrs now and it looks like it might pop out. I had my old cover and I ended up super gluing it to the mirror. However, I do have a mirror and it does work with the power adjustments....
B006JEUHU4|5|The motorcycle brake shoes work just like I expected them to This was a very good purchase and would do it again just thumbs up
B00FI22RCE|5|My compressor was vibrating the whole car before I installed this.  Now, it doesn't.  The compressor is still noisy but it doesn't rattle everything in the car anymore.
B000ZJYF9S|4|Easy install, light weight but haven't had to use in snow or ice yet so I can't rate the actual use.
B009DM0OGQ|5|Took 30 min to install, and that was only because I was paranoid about lining up and drilling the holes. I keep looking at my before and after pictures and am amazed at how different it looks just from one simple add-on. Shipping was ultra fast as well. Ordered 2 days ago, Amazon tracking still hasn't figured out that it's arrived. I'm guessing that's because it wasn't supposed to until next week. Color match was perfect, and customer service was great. Worth every penny.
B000GKAZMW|5|this thing rocks!  i bought it for my dad because he has limited mobility in his neck and figured maybe it would help him see better in blind spots through the rear view without turning his head around.  It worked way better than i expected.  i liked it so much i bought one for my truck too.  I didnt know i wanted one until i used my dads and i really like how much visibility i have in the back and to the sides of the car just from this mirror.
B002JFEETW|2|Seem like good quality...but they are way too small for my manly head. Gave them to my wife
B00C5SUQ8G|5|Works great for our camper.  No problem installing and use it all the time.
B00075X8RA|2|Was not the quality I expected
B004AHAD2E|5|This is a tough one to rate. It's compact and easy to mount. Since I haven't shorted my trailer brakes I don't know if the breaker will trip, but I have to assume it will if ever called upon. Meanwhile, my brake controller works fine and this unit is doing it's job.
B000IY3KUK|5|My power steering is all better now.
B003G0VWEO|5|In my last vehicle, I purchased Weathertech floor mats.  I almost did the same thing when I bought my 4Runner, but I found the Husky liners to be significantly less expensive.<br />These fit perfectly in my 2011 4Runner.  What I like about these that I didn't have in my Weathertech mats is a lip on the outside of the mat that extends over the threshold of the door.  This keeps sand, dirt, water, etc from dropping down in that area.<br />So far, the snow and water have been manageable, too.<br />The only downside to these types of mats (and this goes for all the types of these mats) is that it's difficult to remove them without dumping some of the dirt back into your vehicle.<br />That being said, when i purchase another vehicle, I will look to Husky again
B00I5X0734|5|Fit perfectly.  Easy to install.
B003V9TCW4|5|Worked well with TR-413 4 pack stems; quick shipping.
B002SSBPQK|3|I got the Brush for my rag convertible and I didn't like it because it left hair all over the place
B004EIDD2Q|4|very handy item, especially when one lives alone in a rural area
B001IGGN0Q|5|Too bad they are made in China.
B0080BKQ4G|5|Old hub caps were faded these new ones really make the car look better. One Two Three Four Five Six
B0017J3XMU|5|This is a great 10 Meter Antenna for the price. I purchased it with the radial kit. First contact was Alaska 59 report with 100 watts, feed point only 6 feet off ground. Next contact was 59 to Christmas Island. Wow. I know it says CB antenna, but as other owners have said, \\"The antenna doesn't seem to care.\\" Great performer with great price. Tunes all bands 10, 12, 15, 17 and 20 meters with built in tuner in my FT-950. Get it now. Your mileage may vary, I will keep mine.
B00B2FCCIA|5|great quality, great price, and free fast shipping. Thanks!
B00CFCHSZG|4|When I place my feet on these I feel the comfort and luxury of these floor mats. No longer will my car be the same, it may be old but the style and comfort provided by these floor mats is amazing. I would have given it a 5 star rating if it came with a butler.
B0041CAECM|5|I ordered these and had them installed. The fit and fish is awesome.
B001QU8CV2|5|Works the way it should! Installed a pair with springs that lowered my HHR, and it handles much better in turns and corners! I willingly gave up some ride comfort around town for the better handling - the trade-off is worth it!
B0059KU9TS|2|poor design, hard to get off to apply to the window. it came apart. I do not recommend this design.
B007NLQO0O|5|This is great value for the money and nice to have on hand at all times. I order again! Shipped in time. All good.
B0080P9Q5W|5|Love these belts. I feel really safe
B0051JGE5U|4|I think it will be a good radiator its the same dimensions and size as other radiators. Unfortunately the radiator is not installed so i cant comment on performance, otherwise it got to me in a respectable amount of time. No dents or dings in the radiator when i got it.
B0053T2ZS8|4|Didn't want to spend too much and/or replace and program the \\"whole\\" key, just needed the cover replaced and this definitley does the job!
B002L1H63A|5|BORGESON ALWAYS MAKES GREAT THINGS AND THERE SHAFTS ARE THE BEST I HAVE FOUND , FOR THE PRIZE . ALWAYS WORK GREAT AND NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH THERE PRODUCTS
B007BL4VHE|5|just what the doctor ordered
B008KTH3ZI|4|i liked it, it has a special compartment for shoes, water bottle, lots of pockets.<br />the body is &#34;flex&#34; which means it always stands up and looks like a full bag even if empty, while it can be folded down easy.
B008YFTB4E|5|exelent item
B000LGSIVQ|4|Be warned that the replacement cover does not come with the attaching straps.<br />That said, my original cover lasted for two years of riding seasonally, and it is well worth having a replacement to be able to<br />continue enjoying the comfort of my air hawk cushion.
B007JSGR9Y|1|The unit I received did not initialize. It was promptly returned.
B001GG2ENI|3|As expected
B00KN282X2|5|great deal
B008CJVDU2|5|They look nice even tough I haven't installed them yet in the car, hope it looks nice when I do!!!!
B000KZ069K|5|I ordered two of these remotes, one for my 1996 Roadmaster and the other for my finances 1996 Buick Regal sedan. Lining the remote to my car was super simple and easy. But for some reason I couldn't link the other remote to the Regal. I believe there may be something wrong with the electrical though. Otherwise great remotes and super fast shipping.
B000FW2MC2|4|I love these cup holders for the floor of my van or even sometimes on a seat.  Sure a fast enough turn will spill anything especially something tall but they do a pretty good job.  The two I got did have a really strong rubber smell to them so I only gave 4 stars.  I hope that goes away with time!
B001JQCCFK|5|Good thick, solid make. Is not a perfect fit for all cars but close enough. Heavy make and floor grips keep it from sliding.
B00407TVNQ|3|The nozzle of the bottle is not very ideal to evenly spray out, color is quite close to the car's.
B00JJK3J4G|5|Excellent fast shipping, just as advertised!
B001FIM1PI|5|Read a review somewhere that experienced the same oddly malfunctioning lights as I had.  They listed this part #, I looked it up and found it.  Easy to install (and I'm NOT a car guy).  This fixed my problem I was having with the lights.  Seems to be good quality, have had no problems with it.
B002HSKLS4|2|If you need to contact support for anything, don't hold your breath. The units works ok but the lack of being able to contact anyone diminishes the value.
B00BQE5JAK|4|These are a good quality LED light strip. I installed these in place of my cargo area light which originally took a 194 wedge type bulb that emitted extremely low light. I made a wedge base adapter and wired 2 strips of these lights into the area since the white plastic cover in the cargo limits light output (See pic). During the day they don't seem that bright but at night they do put out a good amount compared to normal wedge LEDs, but still not as much as I have expected (which I dropped a star for) but bright enough until I find a brighter light strip. It came with 3M adhesive backing, one strip is on and holding well but the second for some odd reason is starting to fall off.
B00EXIEVO6|5|good to have it u are into cars, it wrk great for the price
B001RJN56Y|5|Best flavor
B0009H529I|5|arrived on time, nice price
B003COTFS4|5|Just as advertised. These days, that is saying something.
B00CRF6THY|4|good
B004SRA70O|4|Used this on a Nissan sentra. Someone had left the damper bolt loose and it sheared the key. The good news is this fit perfectly and came with a new woodruff key. Half the price of buying locally.
B00KBAJSOS|5|For the price, it's as advertised.
B006X152SU|3|werks
B00AZOWA5E|5|This unit easily solves the problem of where to put wet items needing to dry when you dont have any trees nearby  to hang a clothes line. Mounts and dismounts easily from my back bumper. The unit is angled so wet items are not on top of one another. The more you use it the faster you can install it. It takes up little storage space when not mounted on the bumper.
B00CHDU472|1|it wasnt the part at all
B00LO0M918|5|I used these on my 2003 F250. These and the 194 size will replace most bulbs on this vehicle.<br />Great replacement for OEM bulbs. These bulbs are cheap and much brighter than incandescent bulbs.<br />The only difference is that these LED bulbs need to be installed according to their electrical polarity, so if the bulb doesn't light up rotate it 180° and it will work.
B0018LMSD2|5|These things are the real deal for people that keep popping their mounts. This gives your OEM mounts the ability to take on heavy shifting and last you as long as a racing mount would. It's super easy to install and reinforce your weak OEM mounts to new levels.
B0042ORWNI|5|worksfine no complaints with these at all.
B009AR6GU2|1|There is a problem with the knock sensor. The engine light keeps coming on check it out at advance auto. The problem was the knock sensor.
B00GUH9VC0|1|I received the tank with a crack in the stem
B00279NGRG|5|The shipping was fast and easy. The installation was easier. After you pull the shifter up, you remove the leather, and then the trim. Pull out the plugs and snap it all back in place.
B000C2SGU2|5|I had a Saturn thant needed a tensioner. I tried different brands, but they all chattered whenever I put the engine under load like idling with the AC on. Gates makes a good product.
B000W0RQ8C|5|It's a bit too long but I solved that with a couple of rubber washers. Done and dunner.
B00JMLB4TY|5|great price for the 5 pack
B00FPDOQBQ|5|FIT MY WIFES JEEP PERFECT LOOK GREAT
B0031HI0HY|3|It turns out, they compare the &#34;percent brighter&#34; to the end-of-life brightness of a standard bulb.<br />That makes this actually only 5-10% brighter, which doesn't make much difference.<br /><br />Either save the dollars and go with the Long Life version,<br />or pay a little extra for one of the super-bright versions.
B008IT6SWY|5|Worked for my car and shipping was great !!!
B000BUQOFO|1|It broke in half..
B0077YWRJY|5|Everything was as promised with this product. Popped right into factory location with no problems. Easy fix to a common problem.
B0041CAECM|5|Fit my 2006 Road King perfectly. Nice to install a product with no surprises. Fit and finish were excellent. Excellent quality chrome. Impressed with the way they secure to the oil pan, very positive bolting. My only ding would be the oil pan brackets were painted with what looked like a cheap rattle can gloss black and there was bare metal showing. Since this goes onto a black powder coated part I picked up a can of truck bed liner paint and fixed it the way is should have come. I used my old slip on Bub bad dog mufflers and it looks great. I love the way they sound now. I previously had true dual headers. The sound changed from a raspy bark to a mellow rumble which I really like.
B0038N8706|4|IT TOOK A BIT OF WORK TO MAKE THEM FIT
B000NW8EU8|5|was much cheaper than any where else,and came with all the parts and gaskets needed,would buy again and tell all my frinds to buy if needed.very happy with part
B000MU8XHK|3|Looks good and works if you want your bike to be temporarily secured - or at least look that way.  I just had mine cut clean through when someone stole my bikes off of my balcony.  Looks like it was not too difficult to do.  Not sure if I'd buy again in light of this, but still gave it 3 stars for looks and mild deterrent.
B002DZT772|5|The car wash smells like cherry's and is high quality for the cheap price. Griot's Garage products are really good products and recommend for a detailer and enthusiasts.
B00FXK7LRC|5|I was looking for seat covers that would protect the upholstery and also look nice and these fit the bill perfectly. They aren't the same kind of neoprene you'd expect in something like a wetsuit, but a lighter weight fabric that seems to clean up easily. They are comfortable to sit on and they look good--what more could you ask? Communication with the seller was good too. I'm happy. :-)
B005CNNLRY|4|I got them for $95 which is much better than the WeatherTech floormats for twice the price. The fit could be better, but it works for the price.
B000XY15WU|4|These wheels are much lighter than I expected, which is very important given that they are going on an underpowered SXS (Arctic Cat Wildcat).  I have only received 3 wheels, but the quality looks to be superb.  As for the vendor:  Powersports Superstore, BUYER BEWARE.  Their customer service is horrible and non-responsive.  They tell you they will act on an issue and they do not.  Essentially, I purchased 4 wheels; was charged for 4 wheels; but later (8 days after they should have arrived at my house) was told they only had 3.  They shipped the 3 wheels and never credited my card back.  It has been a month since the original purchase.  I am now forced to file a dispute with both Amazon AND my Credit card company.  We'll see if this Amazon Prime is worth the premium.
B000BUQOFO|4|I have used this device now for four trailer treks. While it works well and is easy to store, I wish it was at least a foot longer and one level taller. It never seems to be long enough or high enough for me to get the job done. I may have to make a base for it out of 2x8 lumber to achieve my goal.
B000EVYGZA|5|Works fine. The most useful features are auto-ranging, battery life test, and hand strap. I wish it had retracting probe wires.
B007SKAKPU|4|son loved it. it told him exactly what the car repair shop said. Now he doesn't have to pay for diagnositics
B001U04MWQ|4|The charger works well and is a good value for the money.  The only misleading aspect it the battery boost or quick start.  It appears as though it is only a 40 Amp charge for 3 min.  There is no higher current boost.
B001R1Q62W|5|Fit perfectly...Looks great...
B008032QSI|4|93 short bed 4x4 Fit perfect. quoted $140 at napa
B001AM8FZY|5|correct product, great price.
B000WJEY8S|4|Great Product. Arrived on time. After installation the glue used to fasten it to the engine failed and it melted on the muffler!! No complaints, except my stupidity. Use the screws to attach and I forsee no problems!! Craig
B00068WU04|2|Fits perfectly in flasher socket in 87 Toyota truck. Hyper-flashes with LED bulbs. Tried EP32 and EP32C...the &#34;C&#34; did nothing, but this one hyper-flashed just as with the original Toyota factory flasher. Returned.<br />Ended up wiring in an EP34 and flashers work exactly as they are supposed to now with LED bulbs.<br />Probably works fine with normal incandescent bulbs.
B005NJ2SHG|4|The item is actually grey and purple, where as it appears pink in the picture. Still a good bandana, just different than what I had expected to see.
B0097SDVBG|5|Just what the doctor ordered ........ 40 wt is hard to find in my area and just what my hot rod needs.
B000LG5UG2|2|The product may work. I did not try.  The issue I have it says by Toyota and picture of Toyota keyless entry.    The Product received was a generic looking keyless entry.  Not as pictured and is OEM replacement.  Not from Toyota.  I contacted the seller and they are suppose to fix the advertisement with new picture and get rid of by Toyota.
B000630DLW|5|Fits perfectly!  Already notice a difference in HP! Thanks!
B00MO8OIQI|5|It is very easy to fit and worked perfectly well when installed. Time will be the real test of this part.
B000Q8GVPY|3|Overpriced, but solid and helpful.  One of those things you may never use again...I probably could have come up with something else to use, but this IS the right tool for the job.
B0073UQ67Q|5|This is AWESOME!!!!
B009PDCJKW|4|Worked great but had to be programmed and paired to my car from an expert. Cost about $30.00 for that service.
B00DYOVXZ0|4|I wanted to be able to see diagnostics for my new Highlander.  This unit plugged in to the OBD2 socket and gave the readouts I wanted.
B00MO1YB8U|2|Item did not come as shown- it had a big 13 on it that I had to cut off. The sticker and backing were cut as if by a child with play scissors. I bought this item as a gift, and it looked very poorly homemade and embarrassing.
B0060AXFZQ|5|I bought these lights hoping they would add a custom look to my camaro and boy did they ever. They look a thousand times better than the plane stock tail lights and fit right into place like they should. I highly recommend Eautolights for any vehicle and the fog lights are a bonus.
B00FUE5XWG|4|You will need to buy/install your own eyelets for the battery wire connections for proper installation. (not included) Wire lengths are very short and makes routing difficult. 4&#34; to 6&#34; more wire lenghth would be better. One wire is very long and one is extremely short. (I have a full size bagger)  Make sure you have extra zip ties for temporary placement. 2 remotes are a plus, and over all I'm not having any problems with the lights or remotes.
B003RWX4OC|5|Had my doubts but my remotes work great and were easy to program!!!
B00FVU4SI4|1|This was not as thick as I expected. Does not provide enough cushion comfort.
B00CH6T18C|4|I like that this product is made with natural ingredients and is Eco friendly. Most importantly the product leaves the leather soft without a greasy feeling left on the seat. It also leaves a pleasant odor.
B003SRRFY6|4|I installed them in a 2006 Crown Vic Police Interceptor, and they look amazing.  I took all the seats out and did them on the workbench, this make getting them to fit nice much simpler.  The back seat looks factory, and the front fit very tight.  I did get a little run in the side when I cut a hole for the lumbar support button, but I hit it with a little liquid stitch to keep it from getting any worse.  I had one spot on the driver seat that did not get stitched correctly but I fixed it with a little hand sewing.  I stitched the head reset at the bottom rather than using the little straps for a more factory look and I used an industrial clothing steamer to take out the packing wrinkles.  I am taking off one star for the bad stitch and the cheap fabric, but for $30 I did not expect them to be as good as they are.  I would love to have this same set in heavy duty fabric.
B0009JKI6S|5|Work fine now I can see out again no matter weather snow or rain. No more tying to look throw streaks.
B0053OC35I|5|First,the sizing issue. I have worn size large for so many years that it is almost an automatic reflex when ordering. I am ,though,creeping up in girth. After reading the reviews on this jacket,I ordered the extra large. It is an absolutely perfect fit. ( beware of Leather up's return policy--read it very carefully before you order) The jacket greatly exceeded my expectations. Besides the fit,it looks good. It is well ventilated. I like the pockets including the inside zippered pocket that is perfect for a phone. The lining is easy to insert and remove. There really isn't anything not to like. It is very visible to car drivers .It gets a bit warm over 80 degrees,but the safety it provides makes that no problem .
B0002MABGE|4|works well and easy to set up.
B0012RN1YM|3|Was very simple to install, took only a matter of minutes.  Only complaint is that for some reason the rubber cap that protects the end of the plug when it is not being used fell off in only a matter of a few days.  Have no idea why or how it happened, but it should be sturdier than that.
B000CAO89W|4|THE SUNSHADE IS A LITTLE LARGE FOR MY 2002 FORD F-150, BUT IT COVERS THE WINDSHIELD WELL.
B000H0RDB2|1|Terrible. Almost worse than the Sylvania headlights. Not blue or white. Will never buy again or suggest this product to anyone else. Total waste of time, and if it weren't difficult to remove I would return them. Very misleading.

B003NAQTZO|5|Great product. Works like a charm. Took 10 mins to install, Great value.
B001QVA2ZA|5|Works good, yeah
B008JJFYZK|5|I bought 2 of these helmets (for me and the girlfriend) and we both could not be more satisfied. Awesome design too
B0006MTRCY|4|Works great, just don't put too much pressure through it. Bought this to replace one that blew up when too much pressure was applied. That one lasted 10 years though. RV use.
B00ARUU6QG|5|Pretty easy install, watch you tube for how to.  Know that you'll have to drill out and replace 3 rivets. But even with that it went pretty smooth.
B00KFS11W8|5|Just what we expected, perfect fit on 2015 Equinox.
B005FI5BBA|5|Excellent
B0031ZDU62|1|Fast shipping and they die one at a time on my 2004 Mercury Grand Marquis. Would never order again.
B001HX66O8|5|I HAVE A BLACK CAR WHICH I CALL MY SCOOBY CAR.  THE PINK SCOOBY WAS  THE FIRST ONE THAT I GOT AND I PUT THAT ON MY FRONT BUMPER.  IT LOOKED  SO GOOD THAT I HAD TO BUY MORE COLORS FOR MY CAR.  THEY CAME IN THE  MAIL REALLY FAST.
B007PP042W|5|Good Result
B00E0PQKFU|5|They're a Perfect fit. Rides like a dream. Goes super low! Easily adjustable. Can't say much else about these awesome units.
B009DK8FS2|5|Great fit, functions perfectly. Haven't had passenger  side power door lock since I bought vehicle. Excellent replacement for failed original door lock actuator.
B000KL1EJ0|5|It need to be trimmed to fit, other than that, the product work great.
B0067PUMXW|3|They are always a little hard to get off the paper and stick onto other surfaces, even while using cards to apply pressure.
B002W30A4E|5|This is the second pair I have bought, both for a couple buddies of mine.  I received my own pair via a gift.  They look good, the color actually holds up pretty well, havn't had any issues with the color peeling.  Great detail, they sway too and fro nicely, a perfect accessory for the cultured persons vehicle.
B001ULBRWI|5|It works and at half the cost after checking many other sources including Camping World.
B00XQ6UMP8|4|They aren't as bright as I thought. Sucks that they don't come with a ballast. Had to order one separately....
B005CW9U7A|5|worked as described
B001DKSQQQ|5|Good stuff. But dig this:Excellent product at an outstanding price. Hope Amazon doesn't hide this review. Guess you have to write more words to have them submit your evaluation for other readers like you to see respective reviews on respective products. If you say, &#34;I love it,&#34; on any product, they hide your review. So, I'm adding more words to this review and also repeating myself regarding this product, i.e., &#34;I love it.&#34; Hopefully, there is enough words in this review that either Amazon personnel or the computer software program employed --won't push my review into the big black hole. Buy it. Thanks for the bandwidth.
B0031GWMD8|5|part was very good quality came in a well packaged box, very precise fitment as if it where OEM, works great had no problems very great price.
B003ZZM1FY|4|looks good on the wife's car...
B008XNZZ7O|4|A smoker here...this helps alot!!
B008RAEKDS|4|Havnt installed yet
B00F7GZI68|5|Exactly as described, quick shipping.
B00FN2K1UY|4|Very clear instructions (almost too much detail), and aimed at the dealership technician to install. I recommend you install them in a warmer environment than your driveway in the dead of winter, unless you like numb fingers. They are tough little buggers to press onto the floor attachment points when it's cold. And no, you cannot install these over your factory rugs. My only concern is that I'd like a taller edge to the mat; the northeast is notorious for salt and snow. I want to keep all of that muck off my floor. But, so far, so good!
B000C2WF0E|5|Had difficulty finding a locking gas cap at area Nissan dealers and local automotive stores. Reportedly none would work with this truck without giving a warning light. Well I replaced the original gas cap with this cap. Works exactly as it should, and there is no warning light.
B0035U6HZY|5|I have a 2013 Shadow Phantom, and this exhaust is awesome.  Although it isn't as loud as I hoped under throttle, it is definitely a step up from stock.
B001U6DMSK|3|Hard to attach to car seats
B001FC34JQ|5|The quality and look of the product is as shown on the wedsite.  We are very pleased with the cables and they are in use currently.  Roadmaster has always been good products and this is no exception.  We have been travelling towing our car and these are the best cables we have found
B00FDSILVO|2|This it ok
B000J44710|4|Terrific set of saddle bags
B00PCCDPV2|5|Bought this for a recently (forced) purchased used car that didn't have any type of grip on the steering wheel. It makes it a bit thicker (which I wanted) and gives me a lot of cushion (also what I wanted)<br /><br />This is exactly what I was looking for! Love it.
B0002SQXF6|5|This product was amazingly simple to use and very accurate, I knew what was wrong with my car in less than ten minutes. I am really glad I purchased it!
B00XB3WM7W|5|This is a very neat little item. I bought for my new VW Jetta and it looks great and stays on perfect. I have not had a problem with it falling off or moving from the wind driving down the road
B00AKXEZ3A|4|as described
B00DFMP8F2|1|will  not fit my  A4 ,, contracted  seller  they wants  pictures sku numbers. they  should have all  that info on thier files.  the  quailty of  produck  feels  really  cheap made
B000HBNV8U|5|I work in the automotive repair industry and new cars these days sometimes don't use gasket for oil pans or valve covers. That's where \\"THE RIGHT STUFF\\" comes in. Seals perfect the first time.
B006LB9FFI|5|Product is a must for oil additive in flat tappet motors
B007JSGR9Y|5|My unit came all packaged up in the impossible to open plastic case. After opening, I noticed a huge scrape on the display screen. I needed the unit so I kept it once I verified it works (it did and does). It makes seeing some text on the unit tough but isn't really an issue, just wondering why a brand new unit would have a scratched screen already. Anyway, it finds the codes and my code from my 05 Nissan Quest was in there. I verified through a Google search, and it's probably an exhaust issue I'm not fixing since I'm trading it in next month probably. Best of all you can clear the code though not sure if a mechanic could recover it with the more expensive units they use. Bottom line, it works, scratched display or not.<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br />After checking per the comment about the screen protector, sure enough that's what it was so I've upgraded the review.
B000M5ZWBA|4|So once again cheap means no instructions.  And while I don't need help using the dang thing, the light configuration was different than any other I have used.  So it took me a couple tries to put the lightbulb in the correct location.  big deal?  no, but sheesh what would it cost for there to be a small slip of paper with that information?  Even a picture on the box would do.  Is china afraid we'll make fun of the silly translation?  too late, we already do, so make the effort already.  Otherwise the cable is nice and heavy and it works.  The clip is quite difficult to compress to get aaround larger grounds and I ended up pulling the rubber boot way back to help.  But I'm please the boot is nice and thick.  I've torn some cheaper ones and while I don't expext to zap anything, I like knowing this should last.  Once again, 5stars if they had bothered to even provide minimal information or instructions.
B00B7ADIEC|5|Fit perfectly. Plug and play. Works perfectly
B000C846VE|4|When I had to replace my gas cap on my 2004 Chevy Colorado (yes, the check engine light went on, and the factory cap was wobbly), this popped up as the recommended replacement cap. The bottom looks a little different from the OEM part, but it fits and locks in place securely. My only complaint is that there is nowhere to secure the plastic strap that connected the OEM gas cap to the fuel door (to keep the gas cap attached to the car). Other than that, however, great product.
B007NNHCOY|5|Item was perfect, received quickly.  Alternator fit all existing brackets and when checked, charged as required.  I would recommend to anyone.
B001IZKDZS|2|First of all I like the color, I love the side vent system, & straps are super easy to use & install.  The problem is the fabric used. I ripped my cover within minutes of the install. The instructions were very clear that you should be careful near sharp edges, but it hardly took a sharp edge to cut this &#34;fabric&#34;. I know textiles & the fabric used here is a non woven very weak almost tyvek type material. After the install I had 3 large tears, once resulting from the curved edge of my license plate!? The cover comes with 2 large adhesive patch repair pieces which I used a lot of. This product would be so much better if they used thicker, or an actual woven fabric...I'm sure I'll have to buy a new one next year, bummed because I do like the Camco brand.
B000ONZT5E|5|This Uni Filter green foam material worked perfectly to make a new air filter for my portable generator.<br />Unfortunately, the generator manufacturer is no longer in business and the engine parts are also no longer available.<br />The original foam air filter was approximately 1-1/4\\" thick, so I just doubled up on this 5/8\\" thick material using two layers which made for a nice fit. A few minutes with a pair of scissors and a gasket punch set had the generator humming along good as new again. I still have enough left over to make several more filters so should be set for a few seasons. Overall, I've found this to be a very good foam filter material at a decent price and am very happy with it so would have no problem recommending it.
B005R4057C|3|thougt I was getting a pair,like everyone else is offering.
B00GJQDQI2|5|Ordered these brake shoes for My gocart, they did not fit, not the correct size, not the fault of the product, I should've looked before ordering,my gocart  has round brake shoes.
B002JBDH26|5|I have a 2005 Toyota Sequoia.  I received and installed this liftgate handle this weekend.  I feel like this part is really similar in quality to the manufactures originally installed part.  The problematic plastic hook &#34;thingy&#34; is still plastic while everything else appeared to be metal. However for this price, and have saved hundreds of dollars on doing the repair myself...  I am VERY satisfied.  Very fast shipping.
B00BR1TO80|5|Perfect fit for the trunk. Must have for long road trips
B001F2I7SE|5|Good quality and fit. Easy to install. Provides good ventilation while keeping the rain out. My trailer stays much cooler inside. If this one ever wears out under the brutal Florida sun I will buy another.
B00249CSS2|5|GREAT BATTERY, I HAVE A BUAL BATTERY SETUP IN MY 1993 JEEP WRANGLER YJ AND IT IS AMAZING, HAVEN'T HAS A SINGLE PROBLEM YET!
B001F02NCW|5|Beautiful and easy to install. More comments . Where did you but it. The best looking and vibrant colors. Thanks
B0002MABGE|3|Not as sturdy as it claims to be. A smart dog can push the bars down and to the side.
B00A1YPUJQ|5|2011 Sonata Se 2.0T. As describe, highly recommended
B00CWJYFSK|2|nice cover but doesn't fit a 07 road king like stated!
B005MLB0OC|2|These wore out about 6 months after I installed them. I wasn't overly abusive with them, just standard offroad trail riding and they did not hold up. Not very happy with these but I guess you get what ya pay for.
B00IICYTDG|5|Bought this to replace the screw that locks in my seat on my FLHTCU Harley Davidson. Fit perfectly. Nice chrome plating.
B00B494XZO|5|Good shoes. good shift toe protection and well made. would not take to the track but great for around town.<br />took the laces off and just use the velcro.
B009F4JHHO|2|It will not work with the iPhone not any of the iPhones.  I do not know about any other phones.
B0031XULF2|4|Looks nice, noticeable and functionable. Very easy to use. Locking tongs slide out to adjust to many widths of tire and rim. I use this on the rear of the wheel as it helps make it a little more difficult if somone is trying to pick the lock. Remember all locks are pickable. Along with this unit I use a tongue lock and clamp lock both made by TRIMAX. The lock is not heavy gauge steel but does what it is adverticed to do.<br />I read complaint that it broke when driving away with it but hey! These items are mainly for a deterrant against theft as it takes time and makes noise for a thief who does \\"NOT\\" want to attract attention.<br />Nothing stops those really intent on stealing but it certainly helps when the thief has to take extra time trying to get what belongs to you.<br />Best price I could find was on Amazon. Quick shipping and great packaging.<br />Recommend to all as an aid against theft.
B0078QXISK|5|Good quality and very prompt delivery. Thank you. Peter Haugo Jn 3:16
B0030HLV8A|1|THE charger will not allow me to car charge my 680 garmin and still use it.This makes it  impossible to drive, use the garmin and charge it at the same time
B00T8R1LTU|5|These running lights were installed on a 1965 Avion pick-up camper.  It has an aluminum outer shell and a great deal of care had to be taken to install the lights.  First a 2 1/8&#34; hole drill bit was used to make the holes for the lights to be inserted into.  When drilling thin aluminum one needs to run the drill in reverse.  Its slow going but it doesn't rip the aluminum apart and spin the cut out piece of Al as the cut completes.<br /><br />The lights are a good bargain and work very well.  They're plenty bright and are truly good looking.  I can heartily recommend these lights.  They represent a very good value.
B00FAS2ZGE|4|Good product i wish the tip was metal inless you wait for it to cool down it melts
B00684TAYY|5|excellent produt paticuarly for the price compared to the o e m.I have found it to be reliable and works consistently.
B000VU91SG|1|The edge on a few sections is very rough.  It was either made poorly or it was dragged during shipping and damaged.  Didn't open in time to return.  Disappointed in product.
B00FLFVF3K|3|This will suffice but, this isn't quite like the OEM hinges. The back of the hinges are a hard plastic and don't make a sure seal to the glass I'm almost sure they will rust out again. Also, the torx in the fastener are kind of a crummy mill. They weren't cut right and this made it difficult to secure the hinge. However, it's doing the trick. The glass is safe and sound. At this point it doesn't rattle and I feel safe driving it around. For the price I'd buy them again but I would modify them before installing them, and buy better fasteners.
B000EBONY4|5|We live near Palo Alto, CA where it is mostly sunny.     The reflective shade works as advertised, and is able to keep the inside of our vehicle cooler.  This is noticeably true if we park outside for a short duration like 30 - 45 minutes. Anything longer, the inside temperature doesn't seem that much cooler (although the steering wheel is still not as hot).     The only minor issue is it takes slightly longer to fold and unfold this shade. I have had a spring-loaded type, which is easier to use but not nearly as effective as far as keeping the vehicle cooler.     I would rate this product 4.5 stars. It works so well, I ordered another one for my wife's car.
B001ILHTVS|5|Purchased for my 2002 Range Rover 4.6 HSE, and they work great.

B001ABORFW|5|If you have a 1st Gen 6 Cylinder Tacoma like I do, This is by far the most recommended Air Filter there is in the TW forum. Why? you might ask, there are several reasons, #1 is that Toyotas uses Mass Air Flow (MAF) Sensor, If you use a oiled Filter, the Oil might contaminate the MAF. This one does not need oil. #2 is its washability. Since you dont use Oil you actually have several ways that easily restores the flow to at least 90%. 100% if you actually wash it in soap and warm water. #3 is that this should be the last time you need to buy an air filter for your vehicle #4 is it probably could help you gain more power because it flows better than a paper air filter.<br /><br />So far i've had it for a year and i have had no reason to complain. Check out what they say in the TW Forum if you dont believe me. ;)
B00128HIDQ|4|It works on my Jeep. I had to get a replacement because I filled up in NJ, where you aren't allowed to pump your own gas, and the attendant never returned the cap. I wish it had the ability to be attached to the car, to reduce the odds of that happening again, but it's cheap enough that I'm not too worried about it.
B008MM5ZFI|1|Does not do as stated for the price,,am sorry I bought the product
B00DBEP18S|3|These were ordered as replacement for &#34;Watermelon&#34; LED conversion semi-truck cab lights.  They have five fewer LEDs but are much smaller in diameter than the original 24LED inserts.  Those are discontinued and getting hard to find.  I-80 truck stop still has the correct ones for about $25 each, but they're poorly made--the one we replaced had 6 LEDs that had fallen off!  Order 3 packs if you have those lamps and want to maintain a consistent look.  Ordered these, installed one in a customer's cab clearance light and it worked (but didn't match), and sent him on his way with the remaining 5 as spares.  Maybe it's not a fair star rating, but what else can I say?  I will update when I hear back or see the truck again.
B004YJ08GO|4|Still have to use it. Looks nice.
B00199HFFO|1|This key chain was a disappointing purchase!  I wish it was as nice as the one in the picture looks.  The one I received looks old, used, had rust stains and was clearly not an original.  It's a cheap knock off.  Don't waste your money!
B000GAD05G|5|I haven't used these yet but I can vouch for these as a few people on my Honda Civic 8th gen forums have used these and recommend them.  I bought these when there was a rebate special from Valvoline.  Much cheaper than Mobil 1 Synthetic and I'm pretty sure the differences aren't THAT drastic. They're in the carton waiting for another 2k miles for an oil change. Definitely recommended!!
B00LWTQ41W|5|Best prices fast shipping work perfect
B005OTU8XQ|5|This Hoodie is the bomb!
B0002MSY72|5|I used it to sand the leather on the steering column of an F-350 truck that I was restoring. Worked great.
B0023VFV4E|5|as expected and goos replacement, don't include the wire harness, so, keep in mind this.
B0040UYIGS|5|I purchased this radiator as a replacement to my factory unit that cracked at the top end tank. The Godspeed radiator has worked flawlessly from day one and was just as easy to install as a factory replacement but with the benefit of a full aluminum design. My 02 WRX is running cooler with the larger, all aluminum design and is a bit more shiny in the engine bay. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Note: The unit didn't come with any hardware. This didn't bother me, however, as I was able to just use the hardware from my factory unit when swapping them out. If you do not have a factory unit or the hardware you may want to source the proper bolts.
B00ACUELEY|4|looks identical
B00042KJQ4|3|Too much money for what it is. A square of plywood will work just as well and be a lot cheaper
B00CHCPT32|1|they look good is all the have going for them, both mirrros have a convex effect, the left one being worse, so it really dissorts the view..the left mirror is loose and falls out of my adjustmet within a few minutes..<br /><br />no customer service, tried a few times to contact people with no answer<br /><br />not worth the 20 bucks at all, id been better off buying some cheaper $8 mirrors then these
B00J1ZAWE4|5|Great

B00C24YXMI|4|The helmet met my expectations and it matches the description on the item that was posted on the website originally.
B0027SBAP2|5|The storage system was easy to install and has been very handy.  We could just slide things under the seat, but they would only slide out.  We really enjoy having the hidden storage.
B001P29O5Y|5|This thing is solid, so glad I didn't waste a couple hundred bucks on some of the other brands. I haven't put more than 3 bikes on it yet, but I like how good this locks your bike in.
B00PWYKHUW|5|For the first time, my transmission/differential gear oil change was fast and much more cleaner.
B000BO8YVM|4|nice and long! easily reached the radiator coolant holder.
B00JK324Z2|5|The OxGord 10 Gauge 12 ft jumper cables are great.  The handles appear to be well made the jaws clamp tight and are neatly packed in a carrier. Excited to have these in my truck for just in case.
B00A82JLIC|5|Excellent value.  The battery worked like a charm right out of the box.  It helped keep an old string trimmer working.
B0017LB0GO|2|Look good but hard to look into due to size and blue tint the mirror has
B0045I57QA|5|I was a bit skeptical about this thing, as it seemed pretty cheaply constructed when it arrived. But, 2 days after I installed it (on my 2014 F-250 super duty pickup) my family and I head out on a 3500 mile round-trip trek across half the country. After just a couple hundred miles, this thing was already slam packed with insect carnage (and the carnage increased with each mile through a dozen hot/muggy/bug-ridden states)...but after all those miles I found not a single insect or rock (or any other road debris) in my radiators. And the insect carnage falls right out with a quick blast of air from my leaf blower or power washer (and even a broom will remove most of it). So, this thing really proved itself worthy! Install was a snap too (quite literally a snap in fact...took me all of 10 minutes to install!) and despite much heat/humidity and wind etc., the adhesive snaps show no signs of loosening. Overall, lots of bang for your buck in this product. And it looks pretty snazzy too! All of that said, winters are pretty brutal here in South Dakota, so time will tell if the 3M adhesive snaps will survive several months of sub-zero temps and bone chilling winds. But, I'm confident!
B00DPNBXHI|4|This fits my Acura nicely and does fold easily. I agree with the other reviews, product is very thin (hopefully it will hold up over time) and should protect the carpet.
B001AWLTX4|5|Very happy! High quality material for the price and Velcro back for a comfortable fit. If your looking for something thicker than bandana material this is perfect.
B000VKOD9S|5|was able to do myself four very little cost
B00AN74524|5|Arrived before expected very satisfied
B00HV721HU|5|good quality printing, good backing sticker. i had zero problems putting this on and it looks like its painted on. thanks!
B005NLQAHS|5|This is &#34;the one to get&#34;, IMHO, if you are an Android user.  It works flawlessly and paid for itself just last week.  I have it installed in my Xterra and just leave it there and last week my wipers appeared to be going very slowly in the rain. I opened up the app Torque and sure enough it showed me that I was only generating 10 volts - instantly I knew it was the alternator.  BTW, my first OBD2 scanner was the wifi version and come to find out you need an &#34;ad-hoc&#34; connection in Android and that is something Android doesn't do.  Did I mention I love this thing!!
B005EXG82W|5|Easy to install, perfect fit, very strong lift.  Delay in delivery but it's not the seller's fault.  Saved $20 than buying from O'Reilly's.
B009UCGT9K|4|It is the good one for hold tissue paper on the top of car. Easy installation an fit US style tissue box.
B00A6OXAQQ|4|Lights came very quickly and were easy to install.  Provide the amouint of light I was looking for (used for backup lights on my garden tractor).
B003673GWI|5|Treated a Kia Sorento 3.5L V-6  with 129,836 miles on it. (1) Engine immediately began running smoother and quieter. (2) Gas mileage increased. (3) Per cylinder compression readings increased by + 12%.<br /><br />This vehicle has had the oil and filter changed regularly it's whole life every 3,000 miles using Valvoline Dura Blend 5W-30. It had no visible smoke or issues, just normal wear. The compression readings for each cylinder were tested hot prior to treatment, and again after treatment within two (2) days.
B005C74T26|2|This part did not fit properly we keep flipping it over to see if it could be altered somehow for my 1995 Delso. We just adjusted it to look decent because to return it would of cost way over the price of the part and it did not come with a return label... The old part was a better hard rubbery quality and this new one couldn't compare...I was not pleased...
B004GCCKSI|5|Exact fit for my Vibe 2006.
B00KQ01SVO|5|Exhaust sounds great!
B000GU0748|5|My son is very happy with this fender.  He is only 13 but it was easy for him to install it.
B0080DWR5A|5|I have a 2010 F150 Lariat with dual-zone climate control and the fan speed settings stopped working.  The blower would only run at one speed.<br />I was hesitant to purchase this item as tracking down Ford part numbers can be daunting sometimes.  However, this part was roughly 1/2 the cost of the dealership item.<br />I'm please to report that this part worked like a charm and is very easy to change.  Same part numbers as on the original, although the plastic color has changed.<br /><br />This video shows the repair on a like-vehicle:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MTx3alqamg<br /><br />Interestingly enough, Amazon shows this part as not fitting my truck, but it definitely fit.<br />I would recommend this fix as a DIY.  All you need is an 8mm socket or a crescent wrench.
B00AKKGJD2|3|I didn't like the metal S hooks so I substituted zip ties instead. That worked well and now I don't worry about scratching items in the saddlebags. These are handy nets for holding items like gloves.
B003ZJ2HEU|5|I was worried about installing this, but it was very easy, just four screws and you are done.  Only three things I want to note:  1.  The instructions indicate that the tabs of the guard are to go \\"under\\" the weatherstriping (which is impossible) so dont spend any time worrying about that one.  2.  They instruct you to stick the \\"bump-ons\\" on the hood of your car....but you really just need to stick them on the back of the bug guard.  They still protect your paint, without sticking anything on your paint job.  3.  There is plenty of room to wash under it, so dont worry about that....as previously mentioned by another customer, the edges do stick out some...but not bad enough to be unhappy with it.  I would buy it again tomorrow if I needed another one.
B00WNUDS54|5|The parts were exactly what I needed! Delivery was on time and I will order from this company again! Very satisfied
B001KS6FPA|5|Fit my Suzuki Sx4 back window perfectly!
B0002MAFR4|5|Made very well. Picture does not show how beefy it is.
B004SSB5CW|5|Made out of very good material
B000IG20S6|5|Use it in every car we own and every engine I have price is great too
B00B51XCQC|5|i bought this for my husband on his birthday and he loved it. the packageing was great and the color was correct. he had no problems intalling it the same day. i recommend this product.-XOAuriBeauty<br />XOAuriBeauty.blogspot.com
B0006H8QK8|5|Great light. As described. Very bright. Fast shipping
B000FPYHOU|4|Works as expected
B000RT9BNQ|4|Quite large for the size of wires the work for, but certainly heavy duty
B00877SL2M|5|i replace all my interior lights with this product and it gave my car a great look i love it
B003Y8EH9U|5|Great fit! Keeps radio out of the rain and can still play my music while looking good, I recommend this product highly
B00NLS1AOS|5|Great jacket.. All the right designs and fit.
B000IYDEPG|5|Hands down, these are the longest lasting and best wiper blades I have ever used. This is my second set on my daily driver. My first set lasted over 3 years and I change mine alot more often then most people. As long as these are being made, I will by no other and the price for my set was $18.00 less on Amazon then our local retailer.
B001CO17JG|5|Excellent price. And it worked. Check engine light is finally gone after 2 years. Everywhere else I looked either didn't have this part or it was over $100. I'm satisfied and it came quickly.
B004W5TJMO|5|As expected, Awesome customer service!!!
B000ALDY02|5|Good match for my Saturn and fresh paint inside. I have bought touch up paint before that had been sitting too long and become gummy but that was not the case here.
B000FVDJ5M|5|The easy fit is great.  When you tighten it down it doesn't scratch or rub on the body paint.  The tool to tighten the bolts is a great addition, keeping the cap secure. Quality is good.
B0041DY2PQ|5|love it
B000BZLEAY|5|Excellent product so far I have no problem.+++++AAAAA
B00TCKM9I0|4|They didn't stick. I cleaned the surfaces before applying, but they started coming up after a few days. I was disappointed. After posting my review, I received an email where I was offered new, and info on how best to install. They stuck and show no sign of peeling off. Would recommend.
B00CX7UKSK|4|Arrived on time and she loved it.  The quality is a thinner product however for the price, it was a very nice gift.  It fit well in the front seat of her 2014 Jetta.  Beautiful when placed in her car.
B005HMMIJ2|5|MY GIRL LOVE THE HELMET, ITS FAR WAY BETTER THAN EXPECTEC !!!  VERY GOOD !!!!<br /><br />THE PAINT JOB ITS AWSOME, THE FINISH OF THE HELMET, GREAT HELMET !!!!!
B0016HPUS8|5|This part fit without any obstruction
B003F1JHSC|5|The helmet I received was well constructed and put together.  I did run into an issue where the sizing chart vs. the helmet were a little off from each other, the helmet ran small compared to the sizing chart.  I re-measured after receiving the helmet and it is certainly off from what the chart describes as an XL.  With that said, I gave it to a friend who wears a Large normally and he was extremely pleased with how comfortable it was.  It will take him some time to break it in, so we will see what time tells.  My experience with the helmet size might have been isolated, so hopefully it's not a common issue.  Thankfully I had a friend with a smaller head who needed a helmet as badly as I did.  Good luck.
B002FY8A7O|5|OEM fit. Perfect
B004P20FGI|5|This item surpassed my expectations. It is easy to install and does exactly what I wanted it for.It is well worth the money.
B002P3LLSU|5|Changeable lenses are easy to swop, great fit, no nose pain like some goggles and the price and free 2 day ship were a plus! I like the soft foam on these over the cheap rubber foam you often find on lower prices goggles and glasses.
B004MXGXIY|3|Should work as expected.
B000RGS4IM|2|The 17&#34; blade, as delivered, does not fit a vehicle with a PTB mount (e.g. passenger side on a 2011 Equiniox).  The adapter necessary to install the blade is not included in the package.<br /><br />I called the manufacturer and was told that the PTB mount is not included with the 17&#34; blade.  They did agree to mail me a PTB adapter since the back of the package clearly states that the blade is compatibile with a PTB mount.
B00GHR9OU2|1|not the original thing ,i had to drill holes to get it in buyers beware\
B006QH54WU|5|Now THIS is a battery.  Had to replace mine and went with these because it can be difficult to get in the boat and check levels of water in flooded batteries that you have to open.  I noticed that these while a bit heavier, they do hold a charge much longer from what I have seen thus far.
B00FQ0ROZS|3|Lights appear to be good quality and arrived in time, I like the look of the lights. Problem with light was that mounting screws from light were to long and would not tightens down enough. I hac to buy 16 new ss machine screws from hardware store
B00BFXJDX6|5|This light is bright. The adjustability with the switch purchase is awesome. I like how the running light goes out when the turn signal is activated. Very attention getting.
B001G7NR9W|4|product is as posted but cost for shipping was to much....
B000CIGE9G|5|Very great cooler , easy to install !!!
B000E7YYDS|5|This nozzle has all the features needed.  Can spray, sprinkle,or in between. I purchased my own plus three for gifts!!!! It is the BEST!!
B001G63TZA|5|nice pedals. holds up good
B000ZIZHKK|5|Much better performance from my '00 Crown Victoria PI.  Replacement was easy.  Just make sure that you disconnect the battery to let the computer reset.
B00D6WVG70|4|This is a nice looking helmet but I think the fitment runs on the smaller size. I wear size Large in other helmets; this one is a bit snug, which may present an issue if wearing it for long periods.
B002VF8284|5|Filter went in and expanded perfectly once it was installed. Great fit for my 2008 Nissan Rogue
B000FJUC7M|5|Works perfect..
B00EC0Z694|5|Good product
B00DFUPQRY|5|Looks great, took about 30 mins to remove old cloudy clear ones and put in the sparkling new black ones. 1 of the 2 I ordered had a 3-4inch scratch across the center and 1 of the blinker bulbs were bad. But the scratch was not deep so its almost impossible to see and I just used my original bulb to solve that issue. But these look great and were an easy install. Put them on an 05 Sentra 1.8 S. Just be sure to adjust them after install.
B000CO91FY|5|Same thing here, purchased to avoid the CEL returning on a Subaru.<br /><br />On my car, I only have one cat so one set of these offsets was needed.  Drilling this out to 1/2 inch .. boy, what a bear, and I had a drill press.  REVISED: Uses a new titanium 1/2\\" bit with cutting oil and a slower drill speed on my second try ... took 15 seconds.<br /><br />Installation was pretty easy, I nailed the rear O2 sensor with PB Blaster and let it soak overnight.  There is just barely enough space in my car (35th Anny/04 Leg) to install the pair of offsets, but it worked.  CEL has not returned after installing this and clearing.  It is available at Advance (was in there the other day and walked by them).
B005J5CBXK|4|Fit perfectly except for the center cover... not really sure if i'm keeping it on there!
B00INZ65B2|4|Good kit.....worked out well for me.....viewed several online videos on how to install and had it done in a couple hours. My gauges are now working properly. I recommend this kit for anyone having problems with their gauges in GM products.
B000C9NOOS|5|Worked exactly as advertised - direct replacement for original.  Looks, operates and feels exactly like original, but at 1/2 the price from dealer.
B005CXKV54|5|a must have for tuning your yamaha
B00FOSSPGO|5|No issues so far. Preventative measure.
B00192JGN0|5|They fit perfectly. They weren't so expensive that I wouldn't buy them again . Thank you.
B000WJ5O7S|5|Good price, fast shipping, installed with no problems. Runs great
B000C2Y552|5|easy, breezy to install!  well built!
B000CNI20K|5|Prompt delivery and the correct item. I am very satisfied with the quality of the part. My car is working just fine and there are no flaws
B002AGLD0S|1|LED fog lights are not the way to go, I had the change back to convential bulbs as the LEDs are not bright enough.
B00LPIA3T4|5|Pretty much the instant I received this set in the mail, I had already begun putting it to use. Obviously it's a very handy set. Everything seems to be pretty good quality as far as I can tell.
B001SG8Z1Q|1|I am in no way intending to bad mouth Dorman or Amazon with this review.  This plug did NOT fit my, completely stock, 2011 golf TDI.  Build quality seems pretty good, but the specs need to be checked.  If I had torgued this bolt down, I would have cracked the pan.<br /><br />Plug on the left is stock.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon for the speedy refund.
B000CMFTQ6|5|I bought floor mats for my Ford F 150 2008 front and back they all fit perfect.I haven't had one problem
B009R1DQF4|5|Perfect fit for my Cadillac STS splash shield.  Quality is as expected.  A word of advice- buy these things by dimensions; they will fit more than just Toyotas.
B0000AYFTH|5|As expected.
B000E267JC|5|excellent for shielding fuel lines on classic car.
B0000CBILL|1|Just cut the steering wheel with a hack saw and you have a club to hit yourself on the head with!
B00IFHNEYO|5|works like a new battery should
B001V8PRBM|5|Bought this product to help increase the safety of my enclosed car trailer since it's parked near a steep hill.  Works very well and the rope makes it easy to remove.  Great product for the money.
B00AZPI0NE|5|I mounted two of these on the back where my winch is on extended bumper. Really lights it up bro! Now when I am chasing those deer at night and they try to get away, I can throw it in reverse and see while the guns are ablazin....YEHAW...
B00R8HBD86|5|Perfect, just what I needed!  I waited forever thinking I'd need to get these from the BMW dealership or something.  Of course I should have been looking on Amazon!!!
B000C407Q6|5|Bought this last month and have since put a couple thousand miles on it driving across US south. It takes a while to \\"break in\\" in my opinion. But it boosted my MPGs and is a bit quicker and definitely louder, it turns heads. Great investment.
B00413M6DG|5|Great product & easy install
B002927MO4|5|Awesome product
B003IOITRG|3|I thought I could collect live data and view it on my computer.  This scanner only collects four frames.
B002EPSFM4|5|Great product. Works flawlessly.
B00CMP3Z1C|5|This is a very well made unit and has many improvements over a similar unit I bought some years ago.It is now possible to tell how much it is charged at a glance.  Highly recommended for those who want an extra margin of safety when they go out and about...
B001GRSSQ4|5|These fit PERFECTLY in my 05 Mustang GT, and give a killer, custom, low maintenance look.<br />I will literally buy these for any car I will ever own.<br /><br />I've seen some honkys bitching about the logo - here's a pro tip:  Floor mats go on the floor.  It's generally part of the car you don't see, so you don't see the logo.  It was probably a girl that posted that.  Women should not be allowed to purchase floor mats, or any other area rug, carpeting or items for sale in general.  Nor should they be allowed to drive.<br /><br />I would not recommend this product to women, because I hate them.
B0045E3MHK|1|This unit did not work for me at all. After several attempts at different locations and States I never got more than one blue signal light to light up. The HD antenna on my Motor home and signal meter on the TV work better than this device. The last attempt my TV scanned 22 HD channels that I could and did receive. I connected this unit and still got no more than one blue led to light. I would rate this product as useless! Since it was on my Motor home during the summer and my ability to test it was between trips the return date passed so I am unable to return it. I suppose it's possible this unit is defective but I certainly am not going to invest in another one to find out. If the manufacturer happens to read this review I would gladly accept an exchange to try another one. I think the idea is a sound one!
B00CGTIVAE|5|Great Item at a great price! This company makes factory speced hitches that are Identical to a factory hitch and built extremely well. Hitch installing companies' wanted $800 to $1000 to install a hitch and we bought one and a receiver with ball for less than $200, including delivery. I YouTubed how to install it myself and with the installation kit that came with the hitch and I did it myself in 1 hour.
B0091DJWV0|5|Works great, wanted a scanner for air bag codes and can't beat the price.
B00QMNRWPK|3|No adapters for tranny lines......one radiator hose inlet was too small....way to small you pay for what you get
B007JSGR9Y|5|Turns off those annoying &#34;check engine&#34; lights that are due to not tightening the gas cap. Not that it is generally hard to tighten the gas cap, but I think the seals on mine are starting to go out. The problem with just leaving the &#34;check engine&#34; light running, is that on my vehicle, it also disables the stability control and anti-lock brakes, both of which are handy to have in snow country.
B000C32J6S|5|good
B003G97FBY|3|Works good except for the fact a ton of plastic chips fly out of it every time I turn it on
B00K5YCHHA|2|Looked nice, and the color is good and accurate. The fit however is atrocious. Maybe it's hit and miss as some people have gotten good fitting markers. Mine however had simply unacceptable gaps between the side marker itself and the bodywork. Enough of a gap to the point where I wouldn't want to wash the car for concern of getting water/soap on the bulb wiring on the inside. Submitted a return request, I hope the seller follows through. Would not recommend.
B000YE6SQW|5|Purchased both front bearing assemblies at the same time. Comes with the ABS Sensors saving you another $40.  Quality product, easy installation, comes with basic directions but easily done by anyone with basic automotive knowledge.  Save yourself hundreds of dollars and order/install yourself in about a hour. Note: If your brakes are acting erratic then these will also correct that problem do to the fact that they come with the ABS speed sensors).
B004GW5FEY|5|This purchase was a must with the gremlin bell. I will tell friends about these purchases. Happy with the bell and hanger just not so happy with our rings
B0067PUMXW|5|great item
B001O2T43M|5|Very good product. Thank you.
B004J36YM2|5|Exactly the quality that I was expecting. I had already heard about the quality offered by KW. When the coilovers were installed on my car I knew I had made the right decision.  Fully adjustable and sharper handling. It feels like my G37 is riding on rails when I turn. GREAT PRODUCT!!!
B008PJCLO6|2|Kit fit wide range of Toyota and Lexus models with the 3.3 litre engine. Changing water pump at the timing belt change is best practices. Kit seems complete but for the water pump gasket is a cheap paper one when the OEM is metal. Dealers in my area are out so I got a metal Fel-Pro at O'reilly Auto for less than $10. I also got the Zerex Asian engine coolant for 13.99 or half off of the Dealer Toyota brand. Comes with valve cover gaskets but not sure they are needed as mine are not leaking. Once torn down I learned it also needs a upper intake e gasket kit, $31 at O'reilly, and the valve cover gaskets in this kit are the same but on the gasket on the rear of engine is different than valve cover gasket on front...another $16 gasket from parts house.
B00HJ15922|5|exactly as stated
B00A3F4IQE|5|Excellent product . Far exceeded what I expected . Thanks for a quality product and fast shipping .Very pleased .
B00JXZKHRY|5|seems to be perfoirming exceptionally well since the install last week
B000UO47VO|3|I just received this adapter and right before I started cutting my radiator hose I noticed the hole for the sensor is way too small, I wish I knew this before I purchased it. i had thought all sensors were the same size
B007XGYOLA|4|Very effective.  Does what it is supposed to do.  However, make sure you use a respirator and the fumes are quite noxious.
B000XPKWI2|5|Delivered on time.  Easy to install.  Heavy duty construction.  Exactly what I was hoping for, using it as a replacement for a fiberglass tilt tonneau cover.  Much more practical product and looks great.
B000C5H29U|5|Good
B000FW61SI|3|This Visor is okay. It is okay at glare from the sun. I wish it was a little more darker to block the sun with it is very bright.
B0001MQ7EK|5|Use it everyday at work.  Have it plugged in for days.  Works well.  I place some blue ice in it to help keep it cool.  Since it stays on the floor of my truck which gets hot I also try to insulate the bottom with a rug under it.
B009WVDMTY|5|Nice ashtray
B00KWDP83Y|5|Work's great. Thanks
B000ET3WFW|5|Thanks for a great price on this hard to find item. My 1969 Rotax 312cc  is back up and running.
B0075FU2G0|3|getting the OEM RFI chip out of my master key, is not an easy thing to do. I 'm afraid of damaging the chip.<br />tried 3 times, If I damage RFI chip..I'm screwed.Need to get 2nd key working before I attempt this swap.<br />will have to use a dremel tool and very carefully extract RFI chip and then hope it stays in new shell securely.<br />So the jury is still out on this product.
B001DKO73M|2|Good quality part, however my vehicle has a 6 inch lift and outer rubber boot is bigger than the factory one and it rubs on my shock.  I would recommend for a stock ride height vehicle, but not for a lifted vehicle.
B00GLSM0AS|5|I would like to look more Bistno him you make a good cable thank you very much I want needing that
B00PR37XLE|4|look great just wish they were a bit thicker. overall good for the money
B000CGEJ04|5|I had a set of high end shocks that I really liked.  I tried these on my pickup.  I like these as much as the high end set I have on the other vehicle and they are half the price.  The SensaTrac technology really works.<br /><br />I can't address durability at this point since I just put them on but they seem to be well built.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend them if your looking for a smooth ride and predictable handling at a reasonable price.  I wouldn't use them on a performance car but that isn't what they're made for.
B00APOBN5W|5|Very sturdy and the black frame on my black 250 looks sharp. Will probably buy another one for the back shortly
B002XM51CA|5|These are great!
B0068VIYL2|1|Could not get this cover to fit the seat.
B003UT3S6Q|5|I've been using this stuff for a couple years now. I saturate all 4 wheels, then brush all 4 wheels, then power wash it off. It works amazingly well. It doesn't get the wheels 100% clean, probably 95-98% as others have said, but that's because I only do one wash every 3 months or so with the wheels on the car. I imagine if I were to take the wheels off the car and wash them twice they would look brand new.  I bought a 5 gallon jug of the stuff which was about 40% cheaper than buying the bottles. If you haven't tried this stuff you really need to.  Note: as others have said it has one of the worst chemical smells of anything I've ever used. Lime scale remover smells better than this stuff. I keep it in a sealed jug in a sealed ziplock bag in a rubber-sealed plastic tub and I can still smell it every time I go in the closet. It was surprising to learn that it's really not terribly hazardous. You wouldn't want to drink it, but it's not a skin irritant or a major inhalation hazard.
B001DRE70I|5|The rain guards work like a charm and fit easy! i installed mine the day I got them, at 8:30pm and after a little rain that day. They went on easy and havent budged since! I've driven abour 15k miles with them and they havnt faded,cracked,or shifted. Good buy for a good price.
B008FBO8CM|5|I got my decal and put it on my blue laptop cover. I am very happy to show it off.
B000CMFT02|5|Durable,Cleanable, and look great
B00DDOSNH2|5|I bought these to use in my solar-powered pop-up, and they work great.  Not the ultra-harsh white light, more of a softer yellow hue.  Instantly bright.  I am very happy.  Excellent price for awesome little bulbs.
B000ALIRMW|5|The SrongArm trunk lifts fit our Chrylser 300M exactly. I received them very fast and well packaged. They were extremely easy to install, work very well and very strong. I highly recommend these struts when you need replacements. I will return for the replacement hood struts in the near future.
B007PYIGTG|5|Fit like a glove
B004BTF3M6|5|It's a GM headlight dimmer switch and it works just fine. This switch probably fits a couple hundred different cars (mine went in a '68 Pontiac Tempest). Mine managed to disappear somewhere inbetween projects on the car, so for just a couple bucks I picked up a new one. It connected right to the stock harness and the holes matched up to mount on the floor. The switch has good, solid action and a very audible and tactile click response.
B007REFW32|1|MY friend had a decal that looked like this but was much better quality.<br />This particular one from this seller looks like it was printed with a deskjet on label paper. Crappy, gritty quality. DO NOT BUY A DECAL FROM THIS SELLER.
B00D82NT6E|3|Poor quality, but usable with a little help.  Not weather proof like others.  On the plus side they link together if you are installing multiple.  Cost is reasonable.
B00HJ6TYJ6|5|Fine product, fine service!
B002KQ86EY|4|Thanks
B00JW4GIMO|1|does not work. looks exactly the same but did not function properly.
B000A7BMKK|5|Too short on my 2004 F150 truck bed. Too steep unless you park next to a ramp. Might work with lower truck beds.<br />Tip: The longer the better as this will decrease your angle of ascent.
B00AC5S23U|5|Awesome
B002JFEETW|2|The screw came out after normal wear and tear after 2 months. Cheap sun glasses I could expect this but hoped I would get a little more life out of these.
B00939KWO8|4|Directions were awful-until I figured out one page was missing.  Went online to their website--good to go. Two hours and front bumper on 300 SRT8 is safe!  Be aware that really monitors primarily center if bumper with much less coverage to sides.  But works well--rain, car wash, no problem.
B001EOWPOA|4|came on time as promised, as others have posted, the wire diagram color does not match exsisting connector - had to move wires onto different terminals than what this plug recommened,  other than that, works as it is supposed to
B00GZG7X9Y|5|well-designed voltage and amperage regulating.
B0027Z4AOI|4|I lifts the weight.  One star off for not having better documentation, but it does what it is supposed to do.  I have it bolted to the ceiling of our lab and use it to lift 200 to 500 lb loads.  It is better to overspec your lifting devices.<br />If you need to lift more than a few inches, this isn't a time effective device.
B00636BNUQ|5|Took a while to get them but they look good and appear to be good quality. They should last a long time.
B000C5G43A|5|excellent product
B008T4YOY2|5|helmet was exactly what I was looking for...
B005FZYJYI|5|I bought this to install on a Swisher dump bucket.  It required some mods to mount, but it wired right up to my harbor freight winch and works like a charm.
B002IPLZUO|5|During a Crawfish boil and shenanigans going on with it, whole mirror assembly broke off when it was accidentally hit by someone running into it.  My daughter shopped around with various dealers and the prices were extremely high just for the part.  I searched Amazon and to my pleasant amazement, the part was available and reasonably priced!  I was a bit wary so I made sure I kept all my receipts.  Again to my pleasant amazement, the part installed very easily and the fit was right-on.  I am pretty handy but it installed with no special tools, just patience.  It's been in service for several months and it has been working fine.  I would look for parts again on Amazon!
B00F6CFANO|3|Plenty good quality for a street rod, maybe not for a race application extreme spring pressures amy not like this thing.
B00JJ5H5VE|5|This is a GREAT Tire Cover, just be sure to buy from the right seller. ANY cover shipped from China or ANY other country is not made in the US and is a fake. I had to return a few Chinese covers before spending the money for THIS cover, save the time and effort and buy American the first time. This is a lifetime cover. The piping on the edge makes such a difference and protects the stitching from UV deterioration. I have seen a few factory Honda covers with exposed stitching fall apart at the top where the sun beats down on it.. Protect the US economy BUY AMERICAN ! avoid FAKE and COUNTERFEIT products !
B005NLQAHS|5|Great product, I've used it on domestic and imports and it works great, very easy to connect to on my HTC one and my galaxy tab, no problem
B002PUTC0M|5|Precise, easy to use. Seems heavy duty.
B000TWACQG|5|You should always use only correct fluids. Here is a link to a .pdf file for a Jeep TSB on Power Steering Fluid usage. It shows what Power Steering Fluid came with the vehicle from the factory and what is an approved substitute, if allowed. With new part materials and seal materials, it is important to only use proper fluid.<br /> http://www.wjjeeps.com/tsb/tsb_wj_1900503.pdf
B0080IFG5S|4|I've used this tool for years. When you put plug in gun you have to use tip without point to push plug in barrel then attach tip. Works fast and reliable
B00K0R4VDA|1|Had trouble installing them not a easy fit like they should have been
B004SJAY8M|4|I had this product for about a couple of weeks. And do far it works well.<br />I would of given it a 5 star if it would of came with the wiring diagram of some sort (ground, signals, brake, etc...) so that I didn't have to trial and error to find out.<br /><br />I'm using it for my 04 Honda ruckus.
B001LTVCBU|1|Towel color IS important.  I ordered the pink 600gm2 deluxe towels but they sent the 380gm2 GOLD PLUSH towels instead!!! If you order this PINK towell, but they switch it to the gold towel, you have been CHEATED!!!  Also, no microfiber towel should be shipped that has LINT in it!!!  I spent around $20 for about 24 microfiber towels from Costco that had NO LINT in them whatsoever!!!  Gyped!!!  Never AGAIN!!!!  I think they ran out of the 600 weight, so they sent me the 380 weight instead yet charged me the premium price... Slimy POS!  You can avoid having to ship them back by not ordering them in the first place!!
B00L1S0JU6|5|Great towel for drying my car.  Suck up all the water on the car and makes it dry and looking buff.
B005N53C9I|4|They fit pretty well on my 1996 Honda Civic seats. I put the headrests all the way up so it wouldn't be loose. They seem a little bit flimsy but hopefully they last awhile. It's better then my boring old car seats. I love them! I got the steering wheel cover to match also. Makes my car not look so old.
B004ME4NDA|5|Darling Wife is always just out of reach in our camper so I bought her the step stool, it is of good quality and light weight and stores well until she needs to reach into the cabinets, Camco has good quality, reasonably priced, usable products for camping, I always consider their products when I need camping gear.
B0091YV1F4|5|Bright enough to look good but not too bright to where it blinds the crap out of you 100% A++++ product
B00TJBKUP6|5|Great product reasonable priced awesome that I could have find it than going to the dealer
B00067BYDE|5|One of my friends recommended this blade to me about a year ago. I have had my PIAA wiper blades on my car for about 11 months now. They still wipe away rain, snow, and dirty slush away from my window perfectly. I have never had wiper blades that have lasted longer than 6 or 8 months. I had used the Bosch brand before and thought they were a pretty good wiper blade, but these PIAA wipers beat Bosch hands-down! I would recommend investing the extra money in these over any other brand of wiper blade. You won't be disappointed!
B00252E782|5|This is a perfect fit replacement for the cabin air filter on a 09 CLK.  I like that this one has activated charcoal unlike the one that came with the car.  There are less bad odors without having to manually turn on the charcoal filter.
B00D99RQZ6|1|This product was brittle and broke straight out of the package when trying to apply them to my vehicle.....<br /><br />be warned
B00CPGQ1GO|5|I have parked my bike on grass and gravel and wish I had this.  I'm going to put it in my bag so I'll always have it with me.
B002WHABIU|5|Saved the day !  Very easy to repair and saved us big time !  Thank you
B002SZSC5K|5|Starter for mower is great. Easy to install and worked first time without any issues. Works absolutely great and easy.
B00O2IMYMI|5|New blades work fine.  Great customer service.
B000CRI3YG|1|ITEM FALLS SHORT ON PRACTICALITY AND OVERALL USEFULLNESS.  GOOD FOR WINDOWS ONLY BECAUSE YOU'D HAVE TO GET UP ON HOOD/TRUNK TO GET LEVERAGE NEEDED TO COMPLETELY SCRAPE WINDSHEILDS!
B0012WKCNK|5|Works well, looks GREAT!  I couldn't install rear saddle steps due to having dual exhausts.  Found this HitchStep and it really helps me get into the bed of the truck.<br /><br />I was concerned when first putting it in as it was a bit loose.  I thought it might rattle but, it doesn't.<br />Thank you!
B000BUU5WW|5|High quality
B005MZYOAK|5|as described, fast shipping.
B000H94FKU|5|works fine
B0029U2XKY|5|Great Service, my husband has enjoyed watching the satellite shows on it, thanks Amazon!We will shop with you again! keep up the good work
B006CSSKCO|5|Worked on my Clarion NX404 with no issues. Not sure why I wanted the option to have movies on while driving but maybe a passenger will watch.
B008OBUPN4|5|first of all i got the package 2 days after i requested it is brand new out of the bubble wrap it works on my 125cc fine and it looks like what the picture is it also has a new feature on the boot of it it hold in the spark plug tightly its a really good product...!
B009KTDSH4|5|Great mask! I wear it on my 650 ninja when I don't wanna wear a helment. Yes it had a chemical smell to it but if you do any kind of riding you get use to it or you can wash it before use. I went about 100mph and stayed in place with no problems. I wear it over my prescription raybans. It is velcro and may one day need new velcro but great for now. Got to my place quickly in a few days.
B000WK3P46|4|It is great except for two things.  One of those is that my nose does not line up with the breathing slot for this.  I have a huge nose too so I don't think anyone's nose will.  Because of that my breath steams up my shades when both worn unless I breath through my mouth.<br /><br />Second, even though it is reversible and that works good, the skull paint is itchy on my face so I don't wear it that way.  The skull side has a sand paper like quality.<br /><br />Other than those two things, it is great.  Seals well.  Does not seem flimsy at all, and doesn't shift on my face.  Nearly perfect for the price.
B0010GCAWY|5|Perfect condition. Wrapped in sealed plastic. Flawless operation. Pre greased. Bolted up perfectly. Needs no modification. This is OEM equipment.
B00OVA3KM0|5|Great quality! I love my new mats!👍 the cheetah print is so pretty.
B0007RDVG6|2|I purchased this product to clean the wheels on my 2002 BMW X5. My vehicle has the 4.6is trim, therefore, comes with 20&#34; 315 rear and 20&#34; 275 front. Needless to say, the rubber isn't cheap, and I really wanted to clean up the wheels after putting on new tires recently. The wheels are factory clear coated, and over time, the clear coat has started yellowing a bit. I had hoped that this product would brighten up the finish and eliminate the yellowing, but sadly, it did not. I was specifically looking for a formula engineered for clear coated wheels, as this product is, so I was disappointed with the results. Perhaps Mothers has another product or product line that works better for my situation, but it was not immediately apparent from looking on their website or on Amazon. Ultimately, my wheels and tires look very clean, my only complaint is that it didn't get the yellow out, so if your wheels are not yellow, this may be perfect for your application. If you have yellowing clear coat, reconsider.
B008G3A67A|5|like a brand new truck, thanks
B00LTZPJVU|5|For my MTD snowblower 10 HP , worked like a charm.  It took me 30 minto install and worked better than the original. Not to mention the price !
B003CMIH2Q|5|very well done, easy to apply
B00HNOYJZS|1|When I recived this only part of it work and I tryed to get it taken care of and just got no were and I still have a light the don't work like it should
B0080E4OMI|5|good
B0007LMC1C|5|The overall length is 16 inches. About 4 inches for the handle. So yes there are plenty of bristles to clean the wheel. Finally, I can clean my Dodge Charger 5 spokes wheels perfectly. It reaches everywhere. And that seller sells it for less than another one on Amazon sold as a \\"16 inch\\" brush. Well this one is also 16 inches and it is Prime eligible. I wish I had that brush years ago. Give it a try.
B00266KRXG|5|After purchasing and wasting money on several screens &#34;designed for&#34; our car we tried this and it is perfect.  I have recommended this manufacturer to all our friends and family.
B000NJU620|4|For the price you can't go wrong
B000C57MS6|5|Same review for all the struts:<br /><br />I didn't understand just how bad my old struts were until I &#34;helped&#34; a buddy put these in all around. Hot damn, it's like I'm driving on 800ct sheets, I can drink coffee in the car again. I have a relatively old car, and these worked great, just needed a tiny mod for the brake line.
B00CP6MBTA|2|At first appearance these handles seem to be well made. However,  this design is different from the OEM handles.  The pin that the the mechanism is attached to sticks out about 1/8&#34; to 3/16&#34; further than OEM handle.  The pin rubs on window, increasing the effort required to roll window up and down.  I am concerned the the pin could scratch or break the window.  Would not purchase again.
B00KZD8ME8|1|Only one light worked. Returned item
B000BKC2D2|1|I followed the directions exactly, plus let it go overnight.  Cleaned surface and metal insert and used the included wipe as directed, applied the adhesive as directed, held insert in place for two+ minutes and let the glue cure overnight.<br />Attached the mirror the next morning and it fell right off.
B007KLWL7C|5|Exact replacement for the 20th anniversary edition.
B000AUT0O2|1|When the bulbs were fine, the output was a nice yellow color as described.<br />However, not even a month later, one of the bulbs burned out. It's not worth buying these if the bulbs have such short lifespans. I think I might just stick to regular halogen bulbs although I do want the yellow color..
B000E7WLJW|5|Really love this and would recommend it to all considering purchasing in future.  Just what the wife wanted Great Product!
B008SDK89O|5|We have a 5 inch version unit also.  Good traction and appears to be a long life product. Well built.
B001JT5MGI|4|I've been using this in my 07 Mercedes ML320 CDI and haven't had any problems yet knock on wood.
B00LUS1SMU|5|looks grate on my vw.
B008E9110W|4|I am quite happy with the item, no error. I will replace all lights with led's. It looks so much cooler.
B004MW3L9O|5|Installed on a 2005 500CC Vulcan. Yes, I had to enlarge the bolt holes in the triple tree to 1/2 in but whatever. They did NOT come with bolts but I grabbed some stainless steel from Lowes and it's perfect. They look awesome and my existing cables were JUST long enough to not have to buy new ones.
B008QRAMSO|3|Helmet fits snug, good amount of padding, it doesn't appear to ride up while touring down the freeway.  But, it really could use vents to provide air flow.  I've used another half helmet,(1/2 the price of this one)  which had venting, and can't imagine why HJC would short change the consumer of this feature.  Chin strap is bit short, and some cushioning on it would be nice.  I also noticed that the tops of my ears conflict with the higher constructed sides.  I find, I have to pay extra attention to assure my ears aren't bent over once the helmet is on.
B005UUJ6PU|5|Very good sound
B000R9JS9S|3|I just received the helmet today and it is so small that i will not be able to wear it at all. I ordered the size small, I have a Shoei helmet size small that i have a little room in and a Bell helmet size x-small that fits snugly so naturally I thought the small would fit fine. I even measured my head and went to the fuel website for sizing. Not only is it too small but the inner lining (which is quite thin) has a seam running straight up the center of the fore-head and another in the center at the back of the skull that digs in and leave a mark - what a stupid place to put a seam! Luckily it will fit my young son for occasional short trips. I would not recommend this helmet for extended use and definately buy at least one size up. In hindsight I would rather put a few more dollars into buying a better one.
B001P2A4Q2|5|After getting the right mounting kit everything was just right.  Very easy to mount in vehicle'
B001CAR6PY|3|First, it's a bit bulky for a keychain. Weighs quite a bit, too.<br /><br />The light is nice, but the switch for it is mushy and it can take some repositioning to get it to light. And if you're doing that in the dark, you might just light up your palm.<br /><br />I can generally find something in my pocket that would make a better screwdriver than the flat-head that's included, though I'm not usually carrying a crosspoint...unless I expect to need one, which seems to be the only time I need one.<br /><br />The pliers are really too small to do much more than pull out a splinter (which they're too large to do), and the business of disconnecting them from the key-fob is a bit too involved and includes significant pinch-points.<br /><br />But when it's all folded up, this thing looks like a little spaceship, which is cool.
B000Q7WW58|1|Ordered these for my 03 Tahoe, said they fit but this was a lie! No matter where we tried to mount them there was an issue with the hardware and not having enough room!
B0016KH1XM|2|It's not going to stay in place well, because the wheel of the trailer is on the ground in the center of this donut. After I bought this I therefore ended up tossing it out & buying a better one the Camco RV Wheel Dock.  The Camco dock uses the trailer's weight to hold the chock in place.
B000B6JJUK|5|The item came in excellent conditions, well packed, very nice NEW, no defect, as i expected. . . . .
B00SHF5Z64|3|Nice looking, but the thing is it DOES NOT fit 2006 Dodge Chargers.<br />I figured I might give it a try simply because I see some of these posted for &#34;2005 - 2014 Dodge Chargers&#34; (The charger was brought back in 06') so I thought it might of been a mistake, and it was simply a year off, and wouldn't of made a huge difference. Turns out I was wrong, the 06' chargers are threaded, these are screw type. I love the way this looked, but am not willing to superglue it to my car. Has decent weight to it and feels great, just didn't fit my car sadly. Also kind of pricey for a piece of plastic in my opinion.
B001J8ALYW|2|These turn signals are not made to fit ALL bikes and are also made of very cheap materials. But that's why I only paid $12 for them.
B00ES5QX0E|5|Fit great looks like the original mirrors!
B00KYB907O|5|I installed these on my son's 2006 Focus with 96k miles.  His front struts were done - leaking and squeaking.  I was shocked at how simple the complete strut was to install.  First side took about 30 minutes and 15 for the second.  The new struts transformed his little car.  No more noises from the front end and the car just feels tight.  Well worth the extra price to not mess around with a spring compressor.
B000C53XRK|5|This product increases the control compared to the stock steering damper.  Be prepared for a difficult removal of the old one from drag link.  I used a ball joint tool after sawing through the shaft of the old steering damper.  Some people use a pitman arm puller.
B00GWEU1N4|5|Correct size. Bright blue. Easy replacement. If they don't work at first just turn them around and put back in; they should work then. No word on longevity but so far they're working well.
B009ZQ12F2|5|Nice straps for price point. Great to keep on hand in the truck. The case keeps them together and under/behind seats in toolboxes together etc.
B00BKO3Z84|5|Looks great, mine was burned up. also replaced bulbs with led ones to stop this from burning up again. would recommend to anyone. NOT FOR USE ON REGULAR CAB, ONLY EXTENDED!
B00KQQ0CKQ|5|Perfect
B00888GP82|5|Fantastic service ! Plate look great.
B00J2HTJPE|5|Excellent product to protect the keys.
B0012WHBSO|5|I've owned another inflator before, but this one is amazing. It looks rugged and well-built, as soon as you take it out of the box. There are no bells and whistles (lights and sorts), but it is extremely powerful.     I have not tried too many things yet, but e.g. I wanted to inflate my kids bicycle tire (granted it is small tire), but it hardly took 10 seconds to fill it up from zero... infact, by 10 seconds I was afraid it would get too tight. It does it fast and very minimal sound compared to the other one I had.     It is conveniently sitting in its case that it comes with, in my minivan for emergency use.
B001P29X4G|5|very good
B00CC4LX2G|5|works and looks great
B000EOGXVW|5|it does fit pecfect
B00BXKZQWS|1|By the time I got around to using it I realized it was the wrong one but to late to return.
B008PTM6EG|2|this one can't say anything good about it so it is hard for me to recommend it to any one
B00FGAWBBA|1|Poor, the first and only time I used them they were so weak they bent.
B0096UAXRA|5|I use this effective item daily as I do traffic control and security. It is visible enough during the day and very bright at night. I purchased because of the price and will purchase another shortly. I wish it had a more mountable control but that one supplied works well with Velcro
B0009SQQ1A|4|We looked for a surge protector and found so many that are so expensive.  This one works great and will protect our motorhome from electrical problems we may run across at campsites.  Happy to have found this one at such a reasonable price.
B000C39BZU|5|very good product. I bought two of these for both my Rangers and both are performing great.
B00BI2APMW|3|tried it on three different vehicles. Didn't work on my 2006 Prius, no activity on 2006 Silverado. But did work fine on friend's<br />Silverado. For the price, seems to work ok, but I'm sure for more money there are other better ones.
B005OBHFHG|3|If you are buying this for an f150 like all cowboys fans own it will not fit . if you have  a honda itll work prefect. NO TRUCKS!!!!!!!!!
B00HVHNT26|4|Perfect fit for my 2005 Toyota Solara. The only reason I gave it 4-stars, its because the rubber attracts lint and dust like no tomorrow. Other than that, its perfect!!!
B007G2KK0U|5|I love these rugs. This is my 2nd one. It is perfect for my deck. I hear they are great for camping as well
B003I8GWPS|1|These weren't actually 4037R's there were for a 94-97 Malibu with a 4037R sticker over the actual part number. Do not order if you really need 4037R's
B005WGR22Q|5|It worked on mine perfectly. I was able to read the error code and find out what was wrong. I was also able to clear the Check Engine Light Indicator after being fixed. One thing to call out is just make sure the connection is a good secure connection on the car. At first I thought it was broken. Then checked the connection and boom that LCD screen came alive and was ready to test! Great peice of equipment, easy to use, and it comes in a nice little carrying case. For the price is is very nice.
B000OWRSRM|2|I bought this set at a great price to put away for a gift for my husband for Christmas. It arrived already re-packaged by the carrier which was my first clue. Upon opening the package, I discovered that multiple bottles had leaked inside the loosely tied plastic bag creating an overpowering chemical \\"soup\\".  The microfiber towel had to be thrown away, it was beyond saving. Several of the bottles are at least a third gone with their contents leaked all over the labels of all the bottles.  Needless to say I am disappointed with the Customer Service response to this issue which is the rote \\"send it back for a refund or replacement\\" mantra which makes absolutely no sense in this situation. I will never order anything like this from amazon again.
B005I65GC8|1|Bought these, installed in a few hours and after careful install they leak almost worse than the ones I took off.  Now have to buy more and do the whole thing all over again with better seals.  Thanks for the headaches!
B006G3YNB2|5|High quality
B000C59XGU|5|Old end links had broken apart; body was shimmying around and of course the steering wasn't all that great either.  Jeep owners talk of this 'death wobble', not having decent end links will certainly increase the severity of that.  This kit tightened down the front end immediately.
B0006JO0XI|5|Works as designed and never lets me down....don't have to worry about the battery overcharging...would recommend to anyone charging a deep cycle battery in the field.
B004IYC5HU|4|It was a great jack and very fast shipping
B001AFJO38|3|I expected a little more, but I guess I should have paid attention. Its fine and all but it pretty light weight and will probably not hold up in the sun very well.
B001QGDW9I|1|They only held up my hood for about two months and now I'm back to propping my hood up with a stick. I will purchase another set from a local auto supplier rather than deal with this headache. Not good for Texas heat apparently my opinion.
B00AMZPI9Q|5|Very simple installation and exact documentation.  Works great.
B00BD4YIJQ|5|Works great on my seats fit as expected.
B009VLQWO2|1|Chassie number - 107044 12 000285This apparently is the wrong key even though it says it supposed to fit my car. Can't use it.
B0002MSY86|5|I recommend this product.
B00DTL4IXC|5|Great product, price and shipped fast. It's a Monroe, what else  needs said.
B0079G3J88|3|A bit pricy but I like it.
B004ZF39T0|5|Great set of lights. Kensun has the best customer support I have seen. I had a problem with lights that was being caused by my vehicle. Spoke to Steve at kensun and he fixed me right up. I bought 4 kits and one had a defective ballast, and they sent a replacement asap.
B004J2V0ZO|5|Great Code Reader!! I Keep It In My Glover Compartment because It's So Small & Compact.
B00138FAMQ|2|Frames initially look really good. After several months of a New England winter, frames begin to pit and corrode. That was on one frame. On the other frame, the screen protector that goes in front of the plate turned yellow. These frames are not very good standing up to the elements.
B001GH1PU0|5|Totally worth it! Found it easy to install. I also love the way it blends with my dashboard. It is very hardy and perfect for my off road driving. Can endure the dirt, mud and water experienced on such environments. Cool product
B00ATXEPQI|5|Purchased this for a long cross country road trip, and it hasn't left the vehicle since.  4 USB outlets to keep those devices afloat, and 1 120V outlet for a lightweight charger that doesn't have a USB end on it. I like the way it can stabilize itself in a cup-holder, but in our minivan, I don't mind sacrificing 1 of the 6 available within my arm's reach.  In a car or sedan with only 2 cup holders up front, I'd much rather have one of the low-profile cigarette adapter-&#62;2 USB ports.<br /><br />If you've got the room to spare, 4 USB outlets and 120V is a luxury I didn't realize I was missing, however.
B009DJRPK2|5|Very happy with product great fit at half the price! Looks great just like new again!<br />I would buy from them again and will next time I need a part.
B00797LPRO|5|love this item, beats the books. Use it a lot in the boat and now going to use for ice fishing.
B004HEUJ3I|4|I had installed 12V outlet on my Triumph and was completing a cross country ride to/from California to Texas.  I needed something to  fit normal American charging devices just like cigarette port in a car.  This worked out perfectly.  The port makes a very tight connection on both ends; going into the 12 V and also plugging any devices into this attachment.  It takes a reasonable amount of pull to remove it and a little more effort to remove a charging device from the female end.  This helped in the comfort of knowing nothing was going to come loose and fly away.  This tool was perfect to charge my phone for music, GPS, and emergencies.  It also allowed me to attach my electric air inflation to adjust tire my tire pressure.  The reason why it is four stars is because of the length of the cord.  From end to end its about a foot, but if you take out the two ends the cord is roughly 8 to 9 inches.  If it was about a foot and half long I would have given it 5 stars.  I ordered two day shipping also and it arrived perfectly on time.  But over all I am very satisfied in its performance of over 3000 miles and several days of riding constantly.
B000IY674G|5|I needed new rotors, but didn't realize how bad until I replaced them with the Centrics.  Love the E-Coating and the return to smooth braking.
B000GTIR5K|5|bought this to use when stabilizing pen blanks so it runs for extended periods.  It does a great job, the only time I notice any exhaust mist is when it first pulls a vacuum, after that it no longer does. nice quiet machine.
B000S2P72Q|5|thank you
B0006HMD98|5|These are the best looking license plate frames I've found. They are sleek but strong and don't cover the month/year stickers on the plate. I needed longer bolts than the the ones supplied with the frame. [[ASIN:B00IZFWZUU The Hillman Group 44048 1/4-20 x 1-1/2-Inch Flat Socket Cap Screw, Stainless Steel, 8-Pack]] These matched the alan wrench size and countersink.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Love it!
B0013REXO8|5|Easy install looks great
B000MIT5VA|4|This is a great product; I only gave it four stars due to the lack of installation instructions.  It sounds good though.
B000WJGO7C|4|The Cobra seems to work well in conjunction with the Vance Hine exhaust system and K&N filter.  Dyno tuning would be the real test.
B00LB49NYS|5|Awesome, installed this on my 2014 350 KTM EXC-F to add GPS and phone charging capabilities. Super easy install, instructions provided are not directly related to application but it up to you to route in the best manner possible. Super easy and a life saver if you run electronics on your bike.
B001NGZQFO|5|Product works very well.  It is not the easiest product to work with but once you get used to it and plan accordingly it is worth the extra effort.
B00335F2KM|4|I have the white 30th anniversary edition Camaro. With the all white front end the black contrast of the covers really give the car a look that pops. But in the heat of summer the adhesive can weaken and the cover may fall off. You can replace the Velcro to solve that problem.
B000CMKG6O|5|As advertised.
B0031OYB84|5|Fits my 2013 Mule 610 xc perfect! Very easy install. Helps protect the factory seat from my 2 dogs nails who like to go on rides with me. Thick enough to protect against spills and items I carry up front with me. Easy clean up, just hose it off. FYI, don't leave/store in direct sunlight (Florida)for extended periods of time.  Will break down the material over time.
B0009H51RG|5|air filter is working how it is supposed to. i bought a used 1993 honda accord and found out after about 6 months that it did not have an air filter. even though i did a tune up on it, swapped spark plugs, cables and valve cover gasket, i did not think about the air filter. once i found out i did not have one installed i searched on here and found this one on the cheap.  basic filter, cleans the air.
B004CGKQNO|5|Incredible deal for a solid tool. Needed this for a fuel injection pump. Good stuff for the price for sure.
B000RDI51G|5|I replaced the stock system with this Magnaflow High-Flow system and Gibson Headers. I already had a Gigson cat-back exhaust so the transition was easy and painless. I recommend spraying the old bolts with penetrating oil a day in advance so the disassembly is easy.  The new system bolts on very easily and comes with all of the hardware.  Note:  I highly recommend replacing the O2 sensors prior to installation because the old one are almost impossible to remove and it's just good preventative maintenance. T<br />he swap out took less than 45 minutes and the end result is great.  You can't beat this Magnaflow product for improving engine breathability and performance.<br />I would highly recommend this over ANY stock converter replacement.
B00GOQFDQA|3|These faux leather bags are a good buy, but know what you are getting. They look nicer than they are. The solidly build outer is nicer than the inner plastic because the inside is bent in unhelpful directions that make it close funny and not provide complete weather protection. However, they are okay and worth owning if you can't afford the high-end versions.<br /><br />I ended up sending these back and ordering a more straight up and down and larger pair so I could put a laptop and my lunch inside. I have yet to mount them, but once I do, I'll do a review on those.
B00C3UKEEM|5|Items as described. Battery is included within packaging.<br />I use it to measure voltage and everyday I need it for buzzer.<br />Good thing is that it has loud buzzer when working in loud spaces.<br /><br />It's nice and﻿ compact, I've try every feature and everything working just fine, lots of features.<br /><br />Quickly delivered to Bosnia in 14 days only!
B005SS9N5C|5|My ATV battery died. Received this quick and easily. Installed in about 10 minutes and was back on the trails. Looked around quite a bit before selecting this one, glad I did. Friend paid almost 40% more for his at a store.
B00469JC8W|5|Very good price and re-usable will use 50 times before replacing it.
B000AA4RWM|5|Fit my RV exactly and arrived promptly.  I was able to put it on my camper without tools.  It fit in the holder that was already in place.
B00HYIETU8|5|Fast shipping.  The faucet was easy to install and works great.  Thank you.
B00666GWJ0|5|Works well
B000BUU5UO|5|it's tp
B00CYJF7DA|1|This may work for you but we were not able to get the oil stain out of my wife's leather purse which is why we bought it.
B00PC9TB5Y|5|Fairly good quality set of tools from the various sets of cheap small drivers I have had over the years. It is very inclusive, and has (I believe) a complete set of pentalobe bits where many sets leave out some of the less common sizes (it does include a 1.2mm pentalobe, it comes in the wrench even though there is not a slot for it). The security torx bits have the depressions fairly well centered and I think would work adequately (a common problem with cheap bits). The straight and flex extensions are also pretty nice features. Also, the handle of the screwdriver comes off and serves as a stubby driver. The case is well built and shouldn't fall apart on you. The only complaint was the 3-4 week ship time that you have to be aware of. I knew about it and just had to be patient, but I don't regret this buy at all.<br /><br />There are other listing for this item that have a better description of what is included, but this listing was the best deal I found when I bought it.
B00513G82U|4|Order this for my wife's 2009 Yamaha VStar 1300.  So far for the money, it looks good and will fit the purpose we got it for a little more storage.  With some small modifications/ adjustments it is on.  A lot of people posted that there were no directions, in surfing the web we found this illustration that was very helpful.  http://www.t-motorsports.com/tbox-jk1001-k/<br /><br />Good Luck!!
B0067BR56S|5|I got this sticker for the windshield of my snowmobile and it couldnt have been more perfect! it was EXACTLY what i was looking for!
B004N99QUO|5|This is a really good brace because it stays on really well (better than any other brace I've had) and it is exactly what I've been looking for!
B002W23BQY|4|The mounting brackets for the Memphis Shades plastic (Acrylic) lowers looks to be of good quality.  They fit the bike well and were very easy and quick to install.  The instructions focused more on legal disclaimers and warnings though. The instructions were of little to no help and seemed to be generated by someone who knew nothing about the product and also could not draw.  I only mention this because instructions seem to be important to many people an seems to be a common complaint about Memphis Shades.  However, anyone who is mechanically inclined and who is familiar with bikes should have no problem mounting there brackets.  A good product.  Buy it.
B002YI95ZC|5|Love this light. So, nice to have a motion light come on when it is dark. Nice that it is LED too.
B0000TX800|5|These fuses are a no brainer.  Save time, hassle and headaches.  If the fuse is lit up, replace it.  Job done
B00G04DTKI|5|Anything that I am forced to put a symbol of the government on I also place a symbol of my faith as well. I placed this on my boat motor opposite side of the decal from DNR. I like the size and look of it.
B009RLXIVQ|3|It comes in 2 pcs and held together by tiny screws. Function ok but has gaps and I dont want to tighten up to much with fear of breaking the plastic.
B00CFBSCW0|5|Great Price & you can't go wrong with Gates as they have a great reputation & proven track record. Check to make sure you get the C-12 carbon belt as that's what I ordered but got the light duty non-carbon G-12 one sent instead, I informed the merchant & they rushed the carbon one to me super fast & let my keep the wrong belt, never hurts to pack a spare in the deep back woods. I am very happy & will buy from them again.
B009A42OII|1|didnt fit as it said it would.
B008CA7SKA|5|The size of this shield is quite flexible.  I use it in my Ford Focus & it's nice to keep the car a bit cooler.
B000CII6XS|5|It does exactly as advertised tires look fantastic
B000ALG0IA|5|Excellent. Strong/sturdy. Fair price. Easy install. Pleased that I no longer have to hold my hood open with my head while do repairs & general maintenance.
B00KBAQHII|1|DOES NOT FIT NISSAN SENTRA! You need the off set sensor, not a straight back connect sensor.  Nissan's Crank sensor looks exactly like its cam sensor!
B000BKGQRK|4|Better than most in this price range. Would be far better though if dial were digital.
B003ASWQVK|3|Pan fits good and does't leak but drain plug won't stay tight even with the washer that came with it. Gets loose after about a week. If you buy it put some blue Locktight on the drain bolt before you install.
B000BYERBI|5|The NGK (6240) PLFR5A - 11 Laser Platinum Spark Plug was a perfect replacement for my QX56. Great product. Would highly recommend.
B0054YEZQC|5|Easy to apply and looks great on our car
B007BCIFY8|5|Good price.
B001QJD45C|5|easy purchase worked great
B00EZUL6ZY|4|Fit well, didn't even need to trim for my Isuzu rodeo, I would however recommend letting them sit out for a few days to remove the smell and the creases from shipping
B004FCWH3W|5|Works great!
B00DTNGVLM|5|This looks good on the back of my car and is a nice change from the standard &#34;family&#34; stickers.  Take your time while applying to make sure that the smaller details transfer properly.  I used an exacto knife to make sure that the small details would seperate from the backing.
B001CT015C|1|I returned a shock that didn't fit my truck but still haven't got my refund back!
B008M1WB7E|5|These liners fit perfectly! I couldn't believe how easy they were to install and how the completely cover the carpeted areas! Definitely recommend these for all the picky truck owners out there!
B002HC5ZZO|5|Same as the other reviewers, last winter my 15 year old snowblower light went out. I need it since I mostly blast in the early morning or after work. The local auto place didn't have this size bulb in 18 watts (which this bulb is) so I got one that was 30 or 35 watts hoping it would work out. No dice, way too dim so ordered this one which was the right move. The seller in my case was Light Bulbs International, and they were fine.
B002GJQ1ZG|5|These are patches designed for use in tire inner tubes.  They work great for that, when using the included glue.  I see that lots of Amazon reviewers have creative uses for the patches, but I can't speak to how well they work for anything but tire tubes.  If you use them for tire tubes, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />If you're a serious motorcyclist or bicycle rider you should carry some of these patches.  A road side patch could save you a long walk or an expensive tow bill.<br /><br />I have performed several road side tube repairs with these patches on motorcycle tubes, and they have gotten me home every time.  Personally, I replace a tube after I patch it as soon as possible, just to be safe.<br /><br />I patched a friend's tube, on a 500cc dual sport bike, with one of these patches about a year ago.  He has put about 2,000 miles on it since an it holds air just fine.
B002W53J6S|4|works as it should, easy to use with those quick connects
B005CVFKG6|5|This product leaves a natural finish without the shine, its also leaves the surface with a anti-static quality.  I have been detailing cars for about 25 years and this is a great product.
B000OAX7XI|5|I have not used them yet but I am sure they will do exactly what I expect.
B0006VORDY|5|works perfect, can't wait to use it more, for your information, need to light stove manually.
B0065NV67C|5|Bought this for my wife's 2014 Benz. Very good quality leather and arrived on time. I was afraid of the cheap chinese quality but this is a Genuine MB product. If you want to protect your Benz remote then buy it you won't be disappointed.
B0067ECZ9M|3|Works just fine, but I wish K&N offered a filter for Ford Explorer with the welded nut on the end. That's half the reason I buy K&N filters.
B006O92UIQ|1|didn't fit! 2011 Dodge Charger
B006GUB2DW|4|...just wish it had a little more in the way of a frame and something to hold the bottom down a little better - purely aesthetics. otherwise it's nice and a much needed upgrade to the convenience store bag hanging in the back seat.
B00CX39J3G|3|Did not fix my car , I'm not convinced part was defective,  (new part) have to take the car to a shop.
B007ANU956|5|Works great and really does a good job, good motor for a good price.. We will know more when we put boat in the water in spring.
B006H340VY|5|Perfect
B00BEN3L9O|4|Disappointed in the air line connectors. They are quick disconnect and constantly leak air out. There isn't really a need for quick disconnect fitting so when I have time, I will be replacing with regular air line fitting to solve my air leak problem. Bad design in that aspect but easy to install
B001C4WKDS|5|All good
B000WNUMW6|4|Like the ad states.
B001CF5ED0|5|Very easy install, you will need a second person for about five minutes to install one bolt on each side to hold the bumper on.  Then its a one person job for the rest.  All hole matched up to factory slots on my 2005 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited.  Tire Carrier went on very easy.
B00069QLVC|4|This item worked at its intended purpose. i laid dynamat extreme on the hood surface then this over top. it helps quiet sound slightly. definatly insulates against engine heat. I only purchased because it was a warehouse deal for 37 bucks. i would not have paid 56 for it. it sticks amazingly well. overall happy with it, just dont expect it to do more than a little sound dampening.
B005PWVOP8|5|+I purchased this for my spotlight and it is a good replacement for the original battery. Works well. I would recommend it.
B00UXAC3WK|5|Nice
B008LL7SEG|5|Handle is wonderfully came in on time
B002I1EDT8|5|I've had these decals on my car about a year now (New Ford Fiesta). Throughout the crazy southern weather they are still intact.
B0074SNMZG|5|Sticks very good
B0043BDN06|5|It seems well made and the price was very reasonable compared to others.  Will purchase again if my car lasts that long.
B007KPUKY4|4|This product worked as to be expected. So I don't know what else to say about this. type three more words
B00KNXACFC|5|The hig cuality on this product. On nice. Price.
B00029XC1I|5|Old Glory - as a bumper sticker - for our Jeep.<br /><br />Not much to say - great sticker, looks good, will be applied to our Jeep as a sign of our support for our great nation.<br /><br />JDMc
B004PX8BC2|5|good
B005MZVH9G|5|Love these &#34;That 70's Show&#34;-style retro flowers -I've looked for them for ages.  I get lots of compliments.  Many thanks, Magnet America!
B0015ABJA4|5|the right stuff
B000WJA5ZY|5|construction of RAM mount stuff is really impressive. Cast aluminum with a retaining spring to keep it from falling apart when switching out mounts. Will buy more in the future.
B002LEEXAG|5|This shiny chrome frame has RAISED letters which look excellent and fancier than all the other Buckeye frames out there.  It arrived promptly and in excellent condition.  Given it will be exposed to the elements, only time will tell how well it holds up.
B003FBV8ZW|2|It's ok but wouldn't buy again, not too clear lenses.
B000WN79LI|5|It does what it's supposed to do.  The attachments included in this kit will find a use in the house as well, particularly if you have pets.
B00HLO49ZK|3|These are good.  The gauge is a bit small, but that is my own fault.  They clearly stated the gauge in the description.<br />This will work well for and passenger car.
B009LZR8CI|5|fit and finish are perfect as expected for a dorman product. ordered these for a 98 lumina and they worked perfectly.
B000Q0K5YA|5|Dorman 620-602 Radiator Fan Assembly<br />Excellent quality fan for AC truck. Great price to boot, Read a post saying THAT after the new water pump was installed with the old O.E.M. fan.. IT BROKE!!! with no notice. SPEND the extra to get the new fan blade.<br />Buy with confidence<br />RagenRat
B005SJ7U8S|5|I have had these frames in my car for 4 months now. There appearance has not diminished in the least. I have washed my car at least 2 or 3 times a month, and the frames are as brilliant as the day I received them.<br />I am very particular about the little thin gs when it comes to accessorized my cars, and this product has held up better than expected. I would easily recommend this item to anyone interested in adding a little something extra to their cars looks.
B004OL97ZA|5|The sticker arrived quickly and I was surprised at how large it was! Great deal for the money!!
B0050VHJP8|5|Items as in description, fast shipping, already mounted, my recommendation
B001C9VL9C|5|I don't know if I misread the description or what but this did not fit my Honda Fit.  Returned without a problem and ordered another.  I really wanted a K and N product.
B001DCYJAG|5|Made in USA!  Timken is the OEM supplier for the factory hub assembly. I have replaced both original wheel bearings over the last few years with the Timken Made in USA units and they have performed perfectly.  Excellent quality.
B00DLMKTOQ|5|Really great product. Nice look. Really bright! Easy install. Really recommend. Thanks for the hids!
B003SYECQI|5|As a worker for the Nissan motor company they teaches quality. And you sent me a great quality taillight for a nice low-price I really appreciate I will keep you in mind if I need any more parts 👍👍👍👍
B000NKCJ10|5|I've been using K&N filter for about 15 years.  My main reason for owning it is once you buy one you NEVER need to buy another Air Filter.  The product has stood the test of time.
B001FIDNGO|5|Great product.  Mine popped off somehow and left a small pointy thing to poke passengers.  I ordered the Dorman Stop Kit and took 10 seconds to crimp on with a pair of pliers.  All good, looks like the exact one that was OEM equipment so this was a perfect fit.  Also, be sure to use something mechanical to secure the stopper as the first time I tried it by hand, it popped off.  When I used the pliers, its obvious this thing is not coming off ever again.
B007RHX1VO|5|Genuine quality door lock grommet. It fits exactly and work fine. Recommended
B004ZF4PNE|5|Excellent product. I received and installed in less than one hour. Of course it may vary on your vehicle. Product came with instructions and also wiring troubleshooting instructions. This is good when similar problem happen with certain vehicles. Lights look great I recommend. Next is my fog lights...
B00540KPS8|4|Serves the purpose well. Keeps stuff from blowing out and is well made. One negative, too pricy.Easy to store when not in use.
B00AC5VPPC|5|Like them very much...thanks!!
B000E9C21M|5|Great license plate cover.
B007UQN220|2|Very cheap fittings will not buy ever again
B00CWRSBXM|5|Fast shipping and great quality leds.  I only needed one for my dome light but I wanted to have a spare.  I had a slight problem when installing.  I have a n 04 civic coupe and the bulb was smaller than the stock bulb.  This caused the bulb to fit loosely and would not make a secure connection.  However I only had to pinch the tabs holding the bulb to make it squeeze the bulb better.  No problems after that.  Had them for a few months now with no problems.  Light output is great, nice cool white color, not too blue.  Great product.
B009QWDAWS|5|great glove. keeps my hands warm during cold weather! i like to wear these. these are nice looking. and stuff.
B000ICYC4U|5|This is one of the best polishes for Aluminum. I have used this with my buffing wheels to get a high-end finish on alum. motorcycle parts. Tried Mothers and it didn't even come close. AAAAA+++++++++ product
B000JFJLP6|5|This unit works awesome, I've had to use it twice this week to start my own service van since the battery wasn't holding a charge, the price is great also, a lot cheaper than local for the same unit.
B00219PZD0|2|CHAIR SRCEW MISSING ALL OF THE NEED TO BE TITEN BUT FOR THE PRICE I GOT WHAT PAYED FOR. NOT FOR LARGER POPLE
B00ELK8W8C|5|just what I wanted
B003PI6KBC|5|Fit like a glove, installed in about 45 mins from rolling the car on the ramps to rolling it off. IIRC  you will need a 17mm, 10mm, and a 12mm wrench/socket.  Don't forget the ball mount (Curt 45522 - 3 1/8in rise X 14in long).  I forgot this but found one at uhaul for the same price i found online. Uses a 3/4&#34; shank ball. It felt solid and I had no problems on the first tow.
B002NTHADQ|3|I installed this on my 98 Audi A4, however I still have my ABS light.  It may be this sensor or it could be that I don't have it seated fully in position.  To soon to to say.  The cable and gromets all fit just right and the plug connector was correct.  Don't forget to buy the retaining clip.
B002UC6X52|5|worked great for my camper
B002J8QPW8|5|I LUV LUV THIS DECAL..I WISH IT SAID A CUTE SAYING BUT IT STANDS CUTE ALONE.I GET ALOT OF BRAGS OUT IT...ITS ADORBS !!!! THANKS!!!!
B000WEMH4G|4|Good quailty product.. I would recommend this product to my friends. But for my use I would want longer leads.
B009T8M6OC|4|It is too big and overlaps the pillars by 4-5 inches.  Nowhere near &#34;engineered fit&#34;.  The one in the picture is nice and angled on the sides.  The one recieved was a aquare. Returned. Nice quality though.
B000FW4LT4|5|good
B000C7ULKK|4|This item was priced great and arrived quickly.  The finish wasn't great, but I plugged it in and it has been functioning great!  I'm very happy with the value.
B003U1NPBW|5|I really love this! So much so that I applied it to our brand new SUV within the first couple of days of purchasing it. I have gotten so many compliments on it as well! Such a great price, and it went on easier than I'd imagined.
B008PTM6EG|4|I have used the meter twice, in the short time that I have had it, and while it took me awhile to figure it out it works very good.  It has saved me a lot of money by telling me what had to be fixed.  I did the repairs myself.  I would recommend it very highly
B000EDQR3W|1|2 of these were purchased and one arrived damaged. However, they were so flimsy that I decided these were not the solution to placing some sort of grille on the RV screen doors. Whoever makes these should be ashamed because it is a rip off and Amazon should not sell them!
B008M5ISGS|5|Love it added power
B0032G2WX2|4|It did not quite fit the OEM bracket as I thought it would.  But it works good and the bike has more power than it did before.
B003V5O16A|3|Does what it should, keeps my motorcycle battery topped off.  I don't think it's as good as previous versions.  If I turn the lights on the bike on and let it sit for a few minutes, the charger won't go back into charging mode unless I disconnect it.  I'd expect it to go into charging mode as soon as their is a drain.
B003BML1HU|5|good deal
B005H12QXG|5|Great product. Don't listen to the haters. Only had em a few weeks but no major complaints. Angling is the only issue. Minor problem. Real happy with this product.
B003SRYTW2|5|Very sturdy and just what I needed! Thank you!
B0067UC8LG|1|I boght it for my isuzu ascender and it did not fit. I am upset. It was for isuzu trooper.
B00BCN7FWA|4|a little small but a great part and a great price, thanks Amazon
B000GZRIC2|5|Nice product, includes EVERYTHING you need to install and ride away.Very good instructions. Everything fits as it should.Chrome finish is very good.
B0009H528E|5|I am happy with the product. It was exactly what was advertised.<br />It arrived in a timely manner. I am very happy with it. I was just<br />what I needed.
B000BZJ6C2|5|Same great product as everywhere else but at a really great price.<br />Quick delivery.
B004ZG9Z60|1|does not work in Can-bus mode on a 2015 R1200 GS Adventure. Yes it was in the correct mode. It did not charge the battery it just made loud clicks one the center of the bike. I emailed the company never heard back.
B000F13KDI|3|This product seems to be small in some areas.  The quality is not there.  I order frequently from Amazon and expected better. I could have done better at Kragen or Autozone for the same money.
B001V8PV2W|1|I read the other reviews, but had trouble believing these could be as flimsy as people were saying.  I hoped they were just using it for large pieces of wood.  My mistake.  These bent out of shape the very first time I used them, and it was on a normal size piece of wood for an indoor fireplace.  Basically the size of what you might get in a package from a convenience store.  Listen to all of the bad reviews, and do not purchase.
B001DRP9G4|5|Cheap, made in Germany, ordered together with 0W-40 Mobil 1 from amazon. It came to my door in less than two days with prime. Very satisfied.
B000C2E62E|5|Cleaned out the throttle body on my 1988 Land Cruiser. This fit well and is a quality gasket.
B002IBQQZC|2|This will not fit the GLS turbo 2005 Bug.  Better off going to VW direct as Amazon does not fully have a good parts identifier for this part.  Good luck.
B0002UNON8|5|Worked real good on stratches
B009LNGBZ0|5|looks beautiful on our jet ski almost better than the original.
B007VAZV56|1|Fake. Doesn't even work. First it took weeks to get to me and then I tried to install them and nothing happened. Don't waste your time or money.
B0002Q81W6|2|Okay product.  Did not come with the proper screws and the actual plug does not fit tight enough inside the bracket.  Still feels like I have to hold the back of the plug when I'm connecting my wire for my trailer.  Spend a little extra money and get the CURT 58001 Easy Mount Electrical Bracket and you will be much happier.
B007VREQWI|5|Great for a small V8 engine, and works very well for the Ford Flathead V8 that is on it as this is being written.  This stand rolls easily (even when I had to roll the engine through grass and gravel to my garage.  I did have to add some stop bolts to keep the handle from falling out.  Do not buy any of the less expensive 3-wheel engine stands.  This 4-wheel version is far more stable and much safer.
B0026T3DU2|2|Works ok, but can't even run finely filtered sand through it without clogging immediately.
B003V5BCQ2|3|You get what you pay for.   It is sturdy and comes with cables of sufficient length to hook up the lights. The lights however, only have one brightness setting, so they may only be used as extra brake lights or extra turn signals. The entire volume of the bags is 'medium' bag, but by design, the compartment inside the poorly chromed steel brackets is small. The compartment is water resistant under normal precipitation condition even while riding. The whole at the bottom for the light cable will permit extra moisture to escape. The apparent 'reflective' strip on the back does not reflect at all(and peals off). I added my own reflective tape. Although you don't notice, the bottom of the compartment is not fully painted. The two steel chromed bars that makes up the holding bracket are poorly welded together, have extra holes in them that serve no purpose except to rust in addition to not being re-chromed after welding, so the attaching piece and surrounding areas rust from the poor weld job burning up the chrome coating. Summary: the bags are small and must have the rust constantly removed to maintain appearance, but serve their purpose.
B0069ANMM8|5|Excellent
B001KKRDMC|5|Great jacket for the price, fits great, looks cool. The back is slightly longer which is great for when you have to lean forward. I get a lot of compliments for it, and it makes me feel safer... I really like it.
B00H873X8E|5|Love it!!
B000H90XDS|4|Works as advertised and saves on battery replacement. Plug in after mowing the lawn our batteries are now three years old and start the mower like a new one.
B00IO4EYMY|5|Great deal on R134a.  Note that oil is not included.
B001KS25VS|5|Boy, oh, boy.  With all of the choices nowadays regarding windshield wipers, what do you pick?  A recent report by Consumer Reports declared that most windshield wiper brands were virtually identical in quality.  And no matter what they say, they all need to be replaced after about six month.  So the only remaining questions are about cost, aesthetics, and will they work with my car?  I bought these for my 2006 MINI Cooper, and they fit great.  They were easy to install.  And I expect to replace them in six months.  Plus, this package includes both wipers.  I have found that on most sites, you have to buy the wipers separately which adds to the shipping cost.  But ordering them both in one package using Amazon Prime, I was able to save a bit of money as well.   They also look nice.  So these are the ones I'll be purchasing in the future.
B0085TKJ5E|5|great addition to atv price was right ,easy to insttall great. Thank You.
B004IJBV20|5|Perfect fit and very easy to install.  Price was right as well.  No complaints!  Just be sure you check that it fits YOUR vehicle before you order one.
B001D22D90|5|There were perfect and I didn't have to use the old worn anti squealer backers since these came with new ones. I only changed the rears but I think I will go with Power Stop for the fronts next time I have to change them. After about 6 or so average city driving stops they were seated and making zero noise.
B000C543GK|5|Moog goodness at a much cheaper price.  Installed right the first time without issue of steering wheel re-alignment.
B0002UNON8|4|if the paint did not damaged, you can almost remove any scratches.<br />but if the paint did damaged, there is nothing this product can do.<br />works well for me.
B00BTLEHSK|5|These seat covers fit very nicely in my Nissan Maxima.  They provided a whole new look to the inside of the vehicle.
B004IVAWVO|3|not a lot of adaptability for mounting. I wanted to mount the pull handle under the door, but the bend in the cable was very tricky to get right. If you're mounting away from under the door it works fine.
B00948RKOS|5|Very nice quality item. I put it on my back glass on my truck.It looks great and it is reflective.
B00FM7B1AO|1|Unfortunately, this was damaged and would not work after about three charges. No hassle return though. Ordered the one suggested by Nissan and it works perfectly.
B0021Z5WAA|4|my paint was fading on the front of my car from being sand blasted in the desert. i used the polish and it helped bring back some of the color. i havent finished my whole car yet. but do like what it did so far. i wasnt a huge fan of putting it on my winshield. it was streaky.
B00029JXNE|5|WORKS GREAT
B00ACOB4YA|5|Sturdy covet. Large, fits '63 Buick Riviera.  Stick on grommet for the antenna came off instantly but the material is heavy enough not to tear.  Good elastic around bottom, good fit.
B00HW8XNKW|5|This basket is incredible!<br />I own a 2004 Hyundai Santa Fe and it only has the side rails. But the basket fits perfectly. I have carried firewood, camping gear, floats, etc...<br />Super sturdy. Easy to put together. Spacious. Looks awesome!
B000C9DWQ8|5|Yessssss... i'm very glad with this purchase. It is exactly what I need. Thanks.
B00HE66RS2|3|Didn't work the way I exspected I may have got a bad batch but it the color was off. The brand is great I've used them a lot of times.
B000C2WL9Y|5|Great part and price
B0016C3SZK|5|This does everything I needed it too. Its strong and fit my truck perfectly. Will buy more from this brand.
B000CITK8S|5|Bought two of these...one for my friend and one for me.... it was great to charge one of the cars that i have, the car is not driven often but dose have an alarm which drains the battery pretty bad.... this charger has a permanent connection and a quick disconnect. Charged my dead battery in 24 hr's
B0012Q60OG|4|pretty basic spark plug especially when considered against all the fancy kinds out there, but when you car calls for it, I get it.<br /><br />Denso makes good products and a lot of Toyota OEM stuff comes with a denso label on it so I trust it heavily when i am buying for my toyota vehicles.<br /><br />Quality is always there and these plugs are no different.<br /><br />Don't forget to lube it so you don't get plug breakage next time you change it out and be careful removing the old ones so you dont break them.
B000CB07YG|3|This alternator was ordered to replace the Bosch alternator on my 1983 Mercedes.  It came in a timely fashion and works well BUT it came WITHOUT the pulley!  The picture shows it with a pulley and the product description does not mention it will be shipped without a pulley.  There was a little slip of paper in the alternator box which said that because of a shortage of pulleys in the market place the alternator was shipped without a pulley.  As it turns out I was able to re-use the old pulley (without having to take it to a machine shop to have it pulled off though the old pulley is actually about a ten [10] piece assembly which I hopefully got in the correct order) but NOWHERE in the product description does it say that the item will be shipped without the pulley (as it specifically does with other replacement alternators Amazon sells).  Those are NOT surprises I enjoy finding out AFTER I have paid and had such an item delivered.  When I go to a local parts store to buy such a part I know this sort of thing before I leave the store.
B00B2CG0TA|5|This is a very nice quality mat for the price. The rubber is soft and easily trimmable and only took about 15 minutes to fit to my SUV.I have had much more expensive trunk mats in the past and while you may get  a little higher quality if you pay in excess of $100....for the money this mat is a much better value in my opinion. It had no rubbery odor and looks like it will easily last as long as we own the car. Very happy with this choice.
B00MX75JZ4|5|Nice Product and Service....
B00J2CI5EU|1|Worst lights ever not bright at all
B00200Q1OM|5|Great fit and look on my 7th gen Maxima.  When the OEM lugs started failing, I purcased another brand at a local car parts store but really hated the look.  These not only look great, even the repair shop has yet to strip one of these out, even with repeated use of their impact wrench.  I thought, given the light weight of the adapter and lock, they wouldn't hold up, but I am please to say they are GREAT!
B00AEM2H00|5|Great chain or if you are like me, an addition to my Maxpedition Sitka, letting EMS know my blood type if anything were to happen to me. Great product, fast shipping.
B009YOA9ZO|5|I was tempted to only give it 4 stars because the pressure gage was more useful for very high pressures, rather than automobile tires.  The gage went so high, that it was hard to read out the difference between 32 PSI and 35 PSI.  At the same time, everything else was perfection.  Because Lexus wanted the area under the hood of my LS to look &#34;clean&#34;, it is IMPOSSIBLE to find the !@#$I# battery in order to connect a high current air pump, so this was an excellent solution for me.
B009YRI64C|5|Easy to apply, looks exactly like the picture.  A fun variation to the normal stick family stickers.
B000LGFQ4S|5|Works fine on my 01 Grand Prix GT. One of my originals broke off at the keyring (a common failure) so I bought this one.    This is not an original Delphi fob, nor did I expect one. Appearance is nearly identical. The picture looks gray but it is black. The battery is pre-installed but tests good. The area around the key ring is thicker and more solid so it should hold up better.    Programming is a little tricky involving several steps but it was no problem. I had to do the key turns/door open twice to get it right. The only variance from the instructions is as someone else said: the car only chimes once after about 5 seconds to acknowledge the fob, where the instructions say twice and 15 seconds. Apparently some cars you have to wait for the second chime so no harm in doing so.    The range is identical to the originals at roughly 70 feet/20 meters, no better, no worse. If your range is a lot less than that, check your battery (or just try a new one): insert a coin into the slot next to the ring hole and twist. The + side goes away from the circuit board. If it's under 3.0V replace it. It takes a CR2032.
B000MK5UVW|5|The heatshield fits the nitro perfectly in the windshield. Secnd heatshield i have owned for the second car i have owned. Both have performed and held up well.
B0007N3JNU|5|Don't throw out that UPS - replace the battery.  This battery is the exact right size with the proper connectors for the indicated replacement cell in your APC UPS unit.
B000C5EAP4|4|Unlike the old Motorad cap it replaced, this one's seal fits tightly and closer to the car's body. Seems good.
B0006BIDRU|3|I ordered this not knowing that you need a second wrench to hold the other side. Maybe I was supposed to know that going in, but I wasn't going to wait another week while the parts came in... ended up taking my Bimmer to the shop to get the thermostat replaced.
B00JH2EUF8|1|Product is way to big 10 1/2 l by 2 1/2 w
B002FDMR2Y|5|Fast and easy.  Good product for the money
B0087OYN90|4|I am very satisfied with my center Console/Armrest.  It was easily installed into the cup holder and is great for drivers that like to rest their arms while driving.  My only complaint is that it does wobble somewhat.  I am looking for a specific mount that will keep it in place better.  Otherwise I am very satisfied with my purchase.
B002ONTBMO|3|Picture looks like standard gold foil embossed USMC decal. It's actually flat printed, and yellow not gold. The quality is fine for what it is, and the price reflects it.
B00429NKWK|5|I had read comparisons of the various headlight restoration systems.  ConsumerReports  suggested this Sylvania kit had the best life expectancy.  I have now done four pairs of lights.  The work is easy and takes a reasonable amount of time.  The procedures make sense.  The results are a new look.  The first set I restored a couple years ago still looks like new.  I recommend this kit to all my friends for appearance, safety (you see better when the light all goes where its supposed to), and courtesy (you don't glare as much to on-coming drivers.)  I worked at a very leisurely pace and spent no more than an hour per headlight. (I'm retired, and time is not an object anymore.)  Could be done well in half that time.
B0049Z2WMQ|5|no problem with sealing
B003CHVYAS|4|Lift was ok, was a little worried when it shipped not all together. However it works good for now<br />Easy to put together folds
B000CIV6AS|4|Just put it in my '96 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The sound is nice and the install was fairly easy. My biggest problem was getting my old one off. Had to use a Sawzall!
B005FNKSMW|5|Holds a good charge which keeps the kid happy.
B004ME8MZ0|4|I have been very happy with this snap on tow mirrors. They make pulling a camper a lot easier. They look like the stock mirror which I also like. The only downfall is the outside mirror vibrates and shakes a little, but that is to be expected when it's only a clip on mirror.
B00VQL12GS|2|Make sure you know what you need when it comes to these sensors. Don't make my mistake and not google the part.<br /><br />This is NOT an &#34;Air Fuel&#34; sensor (the title heading needs to be fixed). That would go before the CAT (up-stream),<br /><br />It IS an O2 sensor. That goes after the CAT (down-stream).<br /><br />Though, I was planning on changing both sensors anyway. Even though, your down-stream sensor rarely goes out. Well, at least not as often as the up-stream.
B001RZA3C2|4|Works as expected by came with a wrong length bolt needed to be 1/4 inch longer
B00GXWGPH6|5|VERY COOL
B00AO17Y9A|5|I spliced it into my horn that I recieved with my Viper Alarm kit... I simply spliced red to red and black to black, this horn is amazing.  Its 5 times as loud as my horn that came with the Viper kit.  I've had it in for over 3 months and do a lot of highway driving... bumps... you name it... no problems with sound or mount.  They'll be sure to hear this alarm when its set off.
B00480N0E6|5|Summary  :  I can see at nighttime... phewf.<br /><br />What's Great (:  Easy to replace, cheap, and effective.<br /><br />What's Not Great ):  They'll make you wish changing dashboard lights was this easy.<br /><br />What You Need To Know ?-:  You can save so much money by doing this yourself... and you can often find tutorials on YouTube if you need `em.  Don't touch the bulbs with your fingers!!<br /><br />Compared To The Other Reviews /-:  The bulbs work great and fit great.  I've been using them daily for about 3 months now and they're still going strong.<br /><br />About Me }(-:  I'm nowhere near a mechanic but I like tackling small projects when I can save money.  I replaced both when one light went out - it was very easy and saved lotsa money.
B000YONT2S|5|these have assisted so much with traveling especially with our granddaughter when we travel with keeping her occupied and happy
B000AM8B1I|5|Nu Vinyl has been around since I was a kid, and its just as good today as the early 1970's. There are other products that come close to the protection for my Classic Car, but I choose this one...none better.
B00JAOAVU6|4|Self explanatory as far as applying. Mine required additional heat to stay put on window. Once fully dried it was fine. Overall I can say I like it. Needs instructions in my opinion as it may help some in the future.
B004PGVYF0|4|Yes it saves time scraping thin films of ice from your windows but not all that useful on thicker layers.  It does thin the thick ice which makes removing it more manageable.
B00DLZSAAI|5|I installed these on the headache rack of my pickup just for work lights and am I impressed.<br /><br />they are a lot brighter than I expected a 27 watt light to be. they stay rigidly mounted too with the supplied hardware. compact and bright. I will be buying more
B007J0V7MO|1|The bulbs I got were dim. They would be ok for interior lights, but not for backup, brake, turn, or tail lights. After a month, some of the elements burnt out, so it is even dimmer. I use them for night lights now.
B000C55MYM|4|The parts I got from Amazon came in a box and it was the box that had the instructions on it,and they were completely understandable, the thing was that the parts were for the rear and I needed them for the front, which I ordered from Rock Auto, but thats ok, because I may need them for the rear, after I order rear shocks....from Rock Auto.
B000SBCHCA|5|Unless you like sitting in the vehicle, this is a must have
