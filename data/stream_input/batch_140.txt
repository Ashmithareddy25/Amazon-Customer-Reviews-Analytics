6300182266|4.0|This is the pilot movie that launched the popular, but short-lived (one season on network TV) science fiction television show.  Universal Studios wanted to capitalize on the science fiction film craze launched in the mid-seventies by the first of the Star Wars films.  At the time of its release, Battlestar Galactica was the most expensive film made for television.  This film was later re-released for theater presentation in Universal's unique &quot;sensurround&quot; format.  Theater goers were treated to &quot;feeling&quot; the vibrations of the battle scenes courtesy of two very large speakers situated in the rear of the theater.  To the best of my knowledge, only two other Universal films were presented in sensurround, &quot;Earthquake&quot;, and &quot;Midway&quot;.  Buyers beware: this presentation is heavily edited from the original TV movie; many of the scenes, especially during the first half of the film, have been deleted.  The only reason I can think of was because MCA didn't want to present this film in two-cassette form and thereby increase the price of this video.  If you want to see the film in its entirety, watch for the next TV presentation on the Sci-fi Channel.
B00000J2KT|3.0|This was one of my favorite movies to come out of the Hollywood Vietnam Movie Period (Platoon, Full Metal Jacket and Hamburger Hill).  I was disappointed by the DVD however.  First of all the sound was in mono and the picture was Pan and Scan for the most part.  I would give the movie 5 stars, but I give the DVD 1 star.  So I guess it averages out to 3.
B00000JPH6|4.0|Given there are so few good fantasy movies out there, it might be necessary to go back time twenty-one years to find one that is half way decent. The Dark Crystal will always remain one of my favorite films, even in light of more modern fantasy films. I get more out of it than Dragonheart or the D&amp;D movie. I got more out of a migraine than I did out of the D&amp;D movie. I think the reason that there are so few fantasy films made, regardless of quality, is because film makers in Hollywood haven't a clue how to handle them, as for the most part they are made by people who have little or no experience in the genre. It certainly can't be the expense given the plethora of science fiction movies that have been released in the same amount of time. Or maybe it's because SF is more easily accessible by the public than fantasy. Time will tell seeing as we are so near the release of Peter Jackson's first installment of the Lord of the Rings. If it tanks, then I suspect the genre will be dead as far as movies are concerned.<br />The Dark Crystal is the brain child of Muppeteers Jim Henson and Frank Oz, both of whom share Director credits on the film. Henson is known for Kermit the Frog and the Muppet Show, while Oz, a veteran of the Muppet Show is probably best known for the voice of Yoda from the Star Wars movies. The film is done entirely with puppets, without a live actor to be seen anywhere- somewhat ambitious for the time, and I think that might have been the Dark Crystal's problem: without any real actors seen by the audience, they may have had a hard time relating to the characters they saw. But even if that was the case for the film's box office failure, one cannot help but to be enchanted and enthralled by the film's overall dream-like qualities. Everything has a definite other-world feel, truly alien, and this is where it succeeds.<br />The world of the Dark Crystal has spent a thousand years in darkness when a race of near god-like beings, the Ur'Skeks, conducted an experiment with a great crystal artifact. The experiment failed and as a result the Ur'Skeks were split into two faces: the vile, diseased Skeksis and the gentle, wise Uru. Through the ages they have all but died off, until there are only ten on each side. With each Skeksis linked to its counterpart Uru-what affects one affects the other. There is also a prophecy that says a gelfling (i.e. an elf) will heal the crystal and restore the world to its proper order. The gelfling in this case is Jen, one of the last of his race and raised by the Uru for a time when he would be needed to fulfill the prophecy.<br />When single shines the triple sun<br />What was sundered and undone<br />Shall be whole again<br />The Two made One<br />By Gelfling hand<br />Or else by none<br />Now, I like prophecies about as much as I like Republicans-both override any concept or notion of free will, but it can be accepted in this case. Jen must find Augra-a Yoda-like old woman who several fake shard pieces as well as the real one, and leaving it to Jen to determine which is the right one. After obtaining the crystal shard he meets Kira, a female gelfling, who was raised by a gnome-like race known as pod people. It falls to Jen and Kira to travel to the castle of the Dark Crystal before the Great Conjunction occurs so that he may plunge the dagger like shard into the crystal. As he travels the Uru begin an arduous trek to the castle themselves for a final confrontation with their other halves.<br />The look of the film is awesome-perhaps one of the imaginative films ever lensed. Production design fell to fantasy illustrator Brian Froud whose surreal and ethereal artwork has influenced every aspect of the film-from the Uru to the Skeksis, the architecture and the animals-none of them look like anything we have on our world, and blended seamlessly into a gorgeous sensory experience that has captivated me for nearly twenty years. Froud published a book-The World of the Dark Crystal, and itfeatures much of his art and narrated by Augra as though she had written the text. It's out of print by now, but if you have an interest in the film, I highly recommend it as a companion peace to the film.<br />There is little I don't like about the film, except for perhaps the pacing, which is a little slow and seems a little disjointed at times. Though that may be the fault of poor editing. The music is wonderful-epic and powerful with eerie underpinnings that accentuates the film perfectly. Trevor Jones should be applauded for his work on the score. This film is magical in most every way- it is true fantasy, and as much as I love Xena, doesn't have a single sword wielding woman in a chain mail bikini. Indulge yourself, good fantasy is so hard to find these days.
B00003CXGG|2.0|a movie made with the sole aim of taking u out of this world even if it's a silly tour.
B0000399WI|5.0|You will definately love this movie. I first saw it when I took my mom to see it on her b-day in 1994. We both loved it. Excellent drama. One of the best dramas I ever seen. It makes The Green Mile look like crap. This movie is the best jail movie ever!!!! Excellent performances by both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. I would definately have to say that this is one of Morgans best films!!!!!!!!
0345377370|5.0|This is not only one of the best spy novels ever written, it's one of the best novels ever written, period.  I just finished it.  Fantastic.  So good, I'm going to read it again soon, perhaps after &quot;Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy.&quot;  You'll love this book for all the right reasons.  You'll not find a better plot, nor will you find characters more loathesome and lovable.  I wish I could give it six stars.  'Nuff said.
B00004XQP4|3.0|This is an OK CD, but it's certainly not punk. I personoly liked it better when Green Day was a fast paced band whose songs where worth listening to. If you like the beatles with clashing lyrics then I guess this CD would be the way to go. Otherwise, check put Pinhead Gunpowder, another punk rock band with Billy Joe Armstrong. I'm sure they'll never sell out.
B00004U8P3|5.0|this is the best movie put out in a long time. it makes you feel like there are really dinosaurs alive! It is an enjoyable movie that you can watch over and over again and not get tired
B00000AFGM|5.0|Long live the poseur consummate!...at last an artist comes along who shamelessley promotes his craft with passion and a healthy disregard for the forces of consevatism and boredom.  This has got to be one of the most catchy, original and brazen recordings of the 1990's with some beautiful photography of the band in all their neo-glam glory.  The song content is strong and well-produced, any track on the album being capable of becoming a single.  Manson's voice ranges from the Antichrist-croak to the sensitive  croonings of 'The Speed Of Pain'.  The keyboard work is clean, futuristic and fluidic while guitar riffs pack each track out as an anthem to all of those people who are unashamed to be beautiful, unconcerned with society's permission, and who love solid rock tunes.
B00003CWRX|4.0|Yes this movie was long.  Yes it did get a little slow at times.  Yes little kids would probably be bored by it.  Yes it doesn't deserve 5 stars for that matter.  But otherwise, this movie wasn't nearly as bad as some of the other reviews say it is.  This is the true story of Jeff Wigand (Russel Crowe), who got fired by the tobacco company for revealing devastating information.  Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), who works for CBS, soon finds Wigand to be the perfect insider for 60 Minutes.  Bergman then takes on the fight of his career to air the story on CBS and reveal the truth to all of America.  This movie has excellent actors, very cool music, and very realistic hand cinematography.  Russel Crowe has a way of acting that makes you want to cheer for him (like in Gladiator and Mystery, Alaska), even though here he has the role of a wimpy-looking middle-aged man.  The Insider is a great movie.  Just a little long, though.<br />Rated R for language, but nothing else.  It's a safe bet that most teens should be able to handle it.
0062502182|5.0|On my first reading of &quot;The Alchemist&quot;, I felt that I had read it many times before. I hadn't, of course. It simply felt that way. It is a quietly inspirational book, a book that tells the lessons we all learn as we go through our lives.<br />It is not a New Age book, it is not a Christian book, it is not a Muslim, Buddhist, Taoist, Hindu, or atheistic book. It is, instead, in intensely human book.<br />Best of all, it is an achingly beautiful book.<br />On my first reading of &quot;the Alchemist&quot;, I found it taught me all that I knew. On my second reading, it taught me that what I thought I knew was merely sawdust.  On my third reading, I discovered that I had created that sawdust, by building my own character... and that some of the timber I used was cheap, and should have been discarded.<br />I think I will read it again.<br />This is not a life-changing book. It is, instead, a life-affirming book.<br />Beautifully written, beautifully translated. Read it - once, twice, or many times.
B000002J09|5.0|This is a remarkable musical work, which achieves its central aim of taking hard rock into true art territory. The graceful, spot-on playing, the lush production and vibrant tonal colors, the economically constructed songs (no filler here), all contribute to what was certainly the record of the 70s and perhaps of all time. Longtime listeners of classic rock radio will certainly recognize such riff-heavy masterpieces as 'Black Dog' and 'Rock and Roll', not to discount the seminal favorite 'Stairway to Heaven'. The folky acoustic side of Zep is explored on 'Battle of Evermore' and 'Going to California', two of their finer and more subtle moments. The album ends with a brilliantly layered piece of heavy-blues mayhem, 'When the Levee Breaks'. There are plenty of great Zeppelin albums, but this would be the one I'd take with me if banished to the moon.
B00002E23E|5.0|i don't know what you people who gave this video less than five stars are smoking, but i reccommend you stop because it's affecting your judgement. this is a masterpiece, led zeppelin at their best. it's so great to actually see zeppelin play, to see jimmy play the double neck guitar during stairway to heaven, and then to play the guitar with a violin bow during dazed and confused (which is the best version of that song ever produced). people who said that this wasn't all that great either don't know anything about led zeppelin or don't know anything about music. I play the guitar, i'm in a band, i know about music. being a guitarist I understand the brilliance of jimmy's playing, it is almost impossible to play, he is a god. LED ZEPPELIN IS GOD.........
B000001FY9|5.0|If I had to pick only one album in my collection to keep, it would be this one. There isn't a single bad song on the entire album. In fact, everything is great even by Marley's incredibly high standards. Also, it covers a huge range of emotions and feelings while never leaving the reggae scene. &quot;No Woman No Cry&quot;, &quot;Waiting in Vain&quot;, and &quot;Stir It Up&quot; are wonderfully laid-back, while &quot;Could You Be Loved&quot; and &quot;Jamming&quot; represent the more dance-oriented end of the spectrum. And unlike a lot of compilations, this doesn't feel awkward. The sequencing isn't chronological, but it actually works even better that way. The entire disc flows well from start to finish, which is good because with songs of this caliber you won't need to skip around at all! If you don't own this, buy it right now. It's a great compilation of some of Marley's finest for the diehard fans, a good introduction to those who need it, and a great listen for anybody. If you don't like it, you probably shouldn't be allowed to breed or consume oxygen.
0671034065|5.0|My girlfriend sent me the hardcover of this book.  We both love Linda Howard but we have never enjoyed her so much as in this book.  I loved the characters and I laughed till tears rolled down my cheeks!  This is one of the best I have ever read and is among my top 4-5 &quot;keepers&quot;.  I will enjoy reading it again and again.  I think I will buy 2-3 copies (paperback) because I have a feeling I just may wear this one out!
B00004Z1MN|5.0|This is one of the best pictures I have seen in quite a while.  It is one of those that you want to immediately watch a second time.
0790729725|1.0|Goodfellas is a Great movie or as my movie buff friends and I put it &quot;Goodfellas is a Fine, Fine, Film&quot; But....<br />This DVD defeats the purpose of DVD. The disk is single layered, meaning that at this movies length they (Warner Brothers) couldn't fit the whole movie on one side of the disk. You have to flip the disk over mid-film!! <br />Granted it is not the end of the world but it is an inconvenience that a DVD need not have. A DVD is capable of containing two layers per side. Each layer can roughly hold about 2 1/4 hours of high-quality video, audio and subtitles. So, then, each side of a DVD is capable of storing over 4 hours of footage. This means that each DVD can have over 8 hours of material.<br />Longer movies like &quot;Brave Heart&quot; can fit on one side of a DVD and still have space for a &quot;Making of...&quot; Documentary and lot more Bells &amp; Whistles then offered here. <br />I have gone over every symbol and every line of text on the package and find no warning of the &quot;Mid-film Flip&quot;. Because of this I am not going to buy another Warner Brothers DVD. <br />If I can not trust the company then my money will go elsewhere, and I suggest you do the same.
B000002GQL|5.0|There're only eight songs, but they couldn't have picked eight better songs for their last hurrah before the end of their legendary classic period. These eight solid songs would be a great introduction to the band for someone new to their music. <br />Stand outs include Ray Thomas's endearing ballad &quot;For My Lady,&quot; &quot;New Horizons,&quot; a beautiful Justin Hayward ballad in honor of his late father, Mike Pinder's haunting &quot;When You're a Free Man&quot; and, of course, John Lodge's hits, &quot;Isn't Life Strange&quot; and &quot;Singer in a Rock 'n Roll Band.&quot; The remaining three tracks, &quot;You and Me,&quot; &quot;Land of Make-believe&quot; and &quot;Lost in a Lost World&quot; also stand tall as true Moodies classics. <br />I disagree with a previous reviewer that thought &quot;Singer&quot; was out of place here; I think it is a very fitting end to this album. &quot;Singer&quot; is a fantastic song in its original glory; sadly, recent orchestrated live renditions (see the &quot;Night at Red Rocks&quot; and &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; cd's) pale by comparison, because John Lodge's definitive bass line is drowned out by the stupid orchestra, which doesn't belong in that song, and the female backup singers are relied upon too much. By contrast, the &quot;Red Rocks&quot; version of &quot;Isn't Life Strange&quot; is brilliant and far superior to the original, which is a little too slow and takes the echo effect too far. (The &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; version of this song is not a good example of this because it was butchered to make time.)<br />I can't stress enough that this album is a PERFECT introduction to the band. I know I said that about &quot;On the Threshold of a Dream,&quot; but I mean it much more so here.
B000051VWW|5.0|SUPERB! Without a doubt, it ranks as one of the best of the year, according to me. Signs of the original and classy sound of Sade are ever present. &quot;Somebody Already Broke My Heart&quot; reminds me of the classic &quot;Is It A Crime&quot;. The one theme that is with this album is the haunting bass sound. BEAUTIFUL. But the song that stands out among all the rest is &quot;Lover's Rock&quot;. That song is the ultimate Valentine's day song. If you have a love in you life that you are having trouble with, listen to that song and it will remind you of who will be with you when you need them most. Finally, &quot;By Your Side&quot; (the first release) is typical Sade. A light-hearted romp between two lovers. If I was cold, Sade can hold me anytime. Let's hope next time, we don't have to wait as long for the next album.
B000002UQJ|5.0|This album was not liked by the critics, but I can't understand why.. The title track is a great 'airy' rocker and &quot;Looking for changes&quot; is Macca doing his 'animal rights' bit. The highlights are &quot;C'mon People&quot; (which sounds a bit 'Lennonish'), &quot;Biker like an Icon&quot; (stupid words, but a good rythm), &quot;Golden earth child&quot; and &quot;The lovers that never were&quot;. The latter is obviously a collaboration with Elvis Costello and has a nice &quot;doomed romance&quot; charm to it. The only track I don't like is &quot;Mistress and Maid&quot; which lacks any soul. &quot;I owe it all to you&quot; is probably written with Linda in mind and is quite weird for Macca.<br />This record is so good because it sounds like a BAND album, rather than just Paul with an ever-changing cast of musicians. Even the excellent &quot;Tug of war&quot; and &quot;Flowers in the dirt&quot; didn't sound quite as solid and happy as this. You get the feeling that Macca was finally getting into Rock'n'roll again for the first time since Wings disbanded. It's such a shame that THIS band couldn't have recorded another album in between this record and &quot;Flaming Pie&quot;!!!! <br />That reminds me - &quot;Cosmicaly conscious&quot; is a brief 1 minute take of a song at the end of the record; as a closing thought.. It's great, but why isn't the whole song on here Paul!!??? This should have been on the record instead of &quot;Mistress and maid&quot;..!  <br />Great record. Ignore negative reviews - this is Wings in the 90s...
B0000508U6|4.0|Okay I'll admit that I know absolutely nothing about this band Coldplay except that they're from England and they always get compared to &quot;Bends&quot;-era Radiohead. But that doesn't matter. What DOES matter is that their debut single &quot;Yellow&quot; is one of the most beautiful love songs I've ever heard in my life. And plus there's also another gorgeous song on here called &quot;Trouble.&quot; The rest of the album doesn't even come close to reaching those awesome highs, but it's still well-played and pleasant. Those two songs, though. Wow. Totally awesome they are. This is the kind of music that gives &quot;pop music&quot; a good name.
B00003CXIY|5.0|I expected this to be a stupid movie about four stupid guys who go for a drive, with Tom Green making appearances throughout. But fortunately I was wrong about this hilarious movie. Road Trip is about an average college guy, Josh (played by Breckin Meyer), who chases down a videotape recording of him cheating on his girlfriend (Rachel Blanchard) with the beautiful Beth (Amy Smart). This video is accidentally  sent to his girlfriend, who goes to school half-way across the country, thus inspiring a road trip to retrieve the tape before his girlfriend views it. While Barry (Tom Green) stays back at the dorms to feed a live mouse to Rubin's pet snake, Josh and his three friend Kyle, Rubin, and E.L. embark on their long trip.      As Josh and his hilarious friends travel across the country to save his long-distance relationship, they have many laughs and adventures, and along their journey they all realize important things about themselves which makes this movie end with a sort of reassuring, happy sigh.      Some of the deleted scenes are really funny. They feature more of Barry giving his campus tour, Rubin's cool dance beats, and Josh's run-ins with cops and Barry's grandma who's &quot;seen it all before.&quot;
0792156684|2.0|Now honestly, take out the admittedly superb special effects and what have you left? Story - predictable. Plot twists - where? Dialogue - remarkably ordinary. Character development - none. Acting - just adequate but the actors had very little to do anyway. Movie length - too long. Sequel - let's hope not! Were it not for the SFX and possibly Mr DiCaprio's persona, this film would have sunk faster than its namesake with nought but murmours of &quot;There goes another Titanic movie.&quot; Okay, I'll give it an extra point for the photography. Was there a soundtrack? It must have been pretty forgettable. Give us a break, there is so little substance to this movie it's not funny.

B00004ZAV3|3.0|I must say I am disappointed with this new collection.   For a new or casual fan this may seem like a terrific CD BUT to a die-hard fan or audiophile this collection is terrible.  The music itself is terrific but I am afraid this will overshadow what is the most important thing about the Beatles, the albums. Yeah we  get all these BIG &quot;hits&quot;(hits 30+ years ago!) but casual fans will be led into to thinking this is the &quot;Best of the Beatles&quot;.  It most certainly is NOT.   <br />Bad sound:<br />The liner notes claim these tracks were remastered from the analog tapes.  &quot;Help!&quot; and &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; are in fact from digital mixes done in 1987 and &quot;Day Tripper&quot; has infact been slightly digitally edited to fix a dropout. I honestly think these were all simply copied from the existing digital transfers done in 1987 and fiddled with digitally.  The good news is the sound on the CD is mastered at a higher volume than the original CDs but that is just a matter of turning up the volume knob during mastering for the CD and NOT a product of supposedly remastering from the original analog masters. The BAD! news is that all the songs have been processed using the &quot;NoNoise&quot; process  to remove tape noise. &quot;NoNoise&quot; is an absolute scurge and a trajedy.  In the attempt to remove tape noise the high end details and ambiance get's stripped off, cymbals and tamborine  loose their color, echo and reverb gets muffled, and the silibance of the vocals increases dramatically. The resulting sound is harsh, glassy, and plastic sounding.  Why do this to songs that have little tape noise to start with.  What is the purpose of &quot;re-mastering&quot; if the resulting sound is worse and less acurate than before.  A pox on re-mastering staff at Abbey Road Studios for doing this!  <br />  I have been assembling my own Beatles MP3 collection and remixing all the tracks and when it came to chosing between using the songs on the original CDs or the songs on this new CD in every case I went with the original CDs.  Granted the original CDs are poorly mastered to begin but in every case the original version sounded warmer and more natural.     Yeah, those old 60's stereo mixes are really bad but the music shines through.  Hopefully we get real quality &quot;remasters&quot; sometime soon and eventually modern remixes of all the Beatles songs.                <br />Better Music elsewhere:<br />Im my opinion the best stuff is on the albums, especially Revolver and the &quot;White Album&quot;.  There are many tracks on those albums that should be heard by today's young listeners to see what the Beatles were up to inside the studio in the mid 60s.  On Revolver which paved the way for many of the sounds we here today we get the sycopated hard rock of &quot;Taxman&quot;, the hypnotic guitars of &quot;I'm Only Sleeping&quot;, the pre-metal sounds of &quot;She Said She Said&quot;, the glorious dense guitar work of &quot;And Your Bird Can Ding&quot; and &quot;Doctor Robert&quot;, and the unbelievable drone of &quot;Tommorrow Never Know&quot;. The latter is awash in pre-synthesiser tape-loops, a driving drum beat, a tinny filtered vocal(and you thought that was a 90s trend), and the icing on the cake an unbelievable backwards distorted guitar solo.  On the &quot;White album&quot; we get the hipnotic plucking of &quot;Dear Prudence&quot;, the classic &quot;While My Guitar Gently, the relentless rythm of &quot;Birthday&quot;, the funky electic &quot;...Me Any My Monkey&quot;, the cool guitar of &quot;Sexy Sadie&quot;, the original heavy metal tune &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;.<br />Lance Hall

0452282152|2.0|While I didn't expect instant insight into the world of Vermeer (this is a work of fiction, after all), I did anticipate a more tightly-wound tale. In sometimes painstakingly straightforward style, Chevalier makes continuous mountains out of molehills. Examples: A &quot;climax&quot; when Griet, the servant girl, moves a bit of cloth to alter Vermeer's portrait? And, in a supposed act of unabashed gaul, Griet opens her mouth for the portrait? I guess I was looking for more. More emotion, besides the much-stated &quot;I could feel his/her anger&quot; or &quot;I knew this was the end of me&quot;...more foresight and hindsight, more description. We are left with an acute idea of how Griet performs her daily chores and how apparently snotty Vermeer's wife is, but there are little answers to the question &quot;Why?&quot; As one review stated, &quot;Art and jealousy mix in the house of Vermeer.&quot; Add more spice to this tale and all that jealousy would begin to make sense, providing opportunity to stop and think instead of flipping, and flipping, and flipping pages.
B00004Z400|5.0|I was pretty upset when i had bought the first edition of &quot;white pony&quot; and then found out that it came out again with another song, but i bought the new one too...This cd has it all. The best tracks on this album are: Back to School, Digital Bath, and Change. They are all good, but those are my personal favorites. i definately reccommend this to anyone.
B000056VIY|1.0|As if her excruciating debut &quot;On The 6&quot; wasn't aural torture enough, Jennifer Lopez brings us &quot;J. Lo,&quot; which sounds practically identical to OT6.  This is not a good thing.  Okay, she may look &quot;phat&quot; in her videos, but the studio pyrotechnics employed here can't entirely cover up the fact that she can't sing to save her life, and the songs are uniformly dreadful.  Unfortunately, this album's selling like hotcakes, proving once again the power of MTV in marketing tripe in pretty packages and fooling impressionable kids into thinking that this is good music.  Stick to acting, Jennifer--please!
B00003CWL6|1.0|Overrated picture #10,000. Again I see a movie the whole world seems to rave about and where others find art I find trash. Seemingly when I discuss my opinion with others, all they will tell me is \\" Well wait until your over forty and you'll get it.\\" Look I GET IT! But if I have to see this movie again at forty it will be too soon. The gimicky story structure infuriated me with its plot device ridden script (Was it necessary for the neighbor's father to be gay? The plotting of the scene where Chris Cooper kisses Spacey was SOOOO cheap!) None of the preformances convinced me one bit. I don't care how many Oscars this one took home, winning an Oscar does not a good film make. If your idea of a good time is seeing Kevin Spacey toss it in the shower and chase little 16 year old cheerleaders, while a closet homosexual next door beats up his son than this flick is for you.  I think this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  I'm ashamed that I sat to the end.  <br />This is ORDINARY PEOPLE for the MTV midnight soap opera crowd.
0780631684|3.0|Compared to many of the new releases, this movie isn't too bad, but that's mainly because most of the new releases in this genre are pretty horrible.  There are quite a few &quot;holes&quot; in the story--(they were all supposed to die pretty much simultaneously, but they cheated death--and now death is picking them off one at a time)  The endings--either the actual one or the alternate one are disappointing.  There are a few fun extras on the DVD such as a &quot;Psychic&quot; test and a death prediction.  Not the least bit scary--but at least it's an entertaining movie!
B000053SPI|4.0|The first thing about the new CD (Which I've received from Japan but ordered YET ANOTHER copy from CD-NOW), is the amazing resemblance Steve Augeri has to Steve Perry. Although in most cases he falls short, he has the \\"general feel\\" down, as well as most of the \\"filler\\" (The \\"ooh's\\" and \\"Whoah's\\" within the song). However, he lacks Perry's vocal range, and in some parts of the song, you can't help but say \\"Man, what was Perry doing when he sung this!\\" - Then you correct yourself and say \\"Duh, it's not Steve Perry!\\" ;)<br />Jonathan Cain is back (with wife? Elizabeth), as is his writing talent, yet again, we're missing Steve's ability to put a great song together. Yet, in songs like \\"Kiss Me Softly\\", \\"All the Way\\", the overall absence of Perry is almost not felt. Neal Schon's presence Is completely felt in \\"All the Things I Love About You\\" and \\"Higher Places\\" which are a cross between `side 2' of Frontiers and solo projects of his.<br />Overall, as a die-hard Journey fan, I'm wondering if Steve Augeri can, as Jonathan Cain once said about Perry \\"Pull it off live\\". Journey is back, but something is missing, however, something is THERE. And I can not stress enough how much you should get this CD!
B000007WNN|4.0|I was disappointed in reading the few bad reviews on this site from so-called Cult fans.  I think their thinking is narrowminded, and not respecting the Cult in trying something different.  I'm a huge Cult fan and even though I love their other albums, this one is my favorite.  The songs totally rock with hard, crunching riffs with the boogie sound I love, sort of like AC/DC.  There are hardly any bands that makes a rock album that totally boogies, and I'm glad the Cult made Electric the way it is.  The only reason why I'm not rating this one five stars is the cover version of &quot;Born to be Wild&quot; is hideous; it should have been left off the album.
B00004W3MS|5.0|This &quot;Hopelandish&quot; myth is getting out of hand. The lyrics on this CD are not in &quot;Hopelandish&quot;. All the lyrics are in Icelandic. &quot;Hopelandish&quot; is something the band came up with while performing new songs live, for which they hadnt completed the lyrics. The myth that the lyrics on gtis byrjun are in &quot;Hopelandish&quot; is false, this is Icelandic (pretentious or not).
0783229526|3.0|This film is incredibly true to the book on which it's based.  The strange thing is that what happens in the book isn't necessarily funny but Thompson's DESCRIPTION of it is absolutely hilarious.  To actually see the things Thompson describes being portrayed in the film is not nearly as funny as imagining it from his brilliantly-written descriptions.  Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro are incredible here and Gilliam is courageously faithful to his source, but they can't really make the film funny for me.  Watching this admirable but somewhat depressing film made me all the more appreciative of Thompson's genius with words.
0385495323|5.0|I really can't remember enjoying a book more than this one, if I have, it's been years.<br />I have seen Simon Singh's production of &quot;Fermat's Last Theorem&quot; on PBS as well. I'm convinced that Mr. Singh is a genius at conveying difficult information to the masses. May his writing career be a long one. I look forward to anything else he writes, whether it be a book or a television show.<br />Simon Singh has a special gift, the gift of being able to explain what could easily be a dry and boring subject. Some of the cryptography in the book is technical and complicated, but he always manages to simplify it to a reasonable level without losing what is special about it. You end up completely understanding the methods used to break each of the progressively more difficult codes.<br />I loved the inclusion of people's notes, original paintings and photographs too. There are photos of the original Linear B tablets and tables of different characters, the Rosetta stone, the original Enigma machine and the designer and all of the code breakers. While reading it, you think of the photos as an aside, I realized near the end that it is a spectacular collection (and selection) of photos.<br />I promise you, if you have even the remotest interest in the subject of codes and code breaking, you'll love this book.
0393039765|5.0|I am a huge fan of the movie Fight Club and I wanted to read the original book to see if there was much of a difference and well..... its a lot different.  Anyone who reads the book will be amazed at it's writing.  Palahniuk has made a book about a normal person into an analogical masterpeice.  Throughout much of the book the author puts analogies in and its just to increase the understanding of the main characters actions.  It's also a psychological masterpiece it brings in to the mind of a anarchist who doesnt realize who he really is.  the book is magnifecently written from one point of view and one narrator tells the story. it rises the imagination of reader.  Where ever your imagination runs this books brilliance will fill your imagination to unbelievable heights.
6304119046|5.0|There are dozens of reviews here so I'll just write a little bit. I'm not sure if this is the best film ever made but it's certainly close. The film is simply an Orson Welles tour de force as he wrote, acted in, and a directed this picture. He did all of those things quite well, too. Realize, folks, that Welles was only in his mid-twenties when he made this picture. Then go and watch him play a man who ages 50 years in the course of the film. If Welles' explosion as an old Kane near the end of the film doesn't floor you, if you don't think he moves, talks, and acts like a 70 year old man, then you must have had your eyes closed while watching.<br />This is a must see film for anyone, anywhere, who claims to like movies.
0553328255|5.0|Sherlock Holmes.  To be fair, he does not need a review.  We all know what he does and how he does it.  We all know The Hound of the Baskervilles, Dr. Watson, Mrs Hudson, Professor Moriarty and 221b Baker Street.<br />Arthur Conan Doyle has laid down a being so perfect at his craft that no-one can ever better it.  Many will moan at the unrealistic side of Holmes' cases or the fantastically ridiculous nature of many of the crimes, but that does not take away from the genius of Holmes.  It is like saying that James Bond is not the best spy.  Of course he is, the scrapes he finds himself in do not detract from his achievements.<br />Why are the stories so good?  It is down to the facts that you know exactly what Holmes has heard and you know that he has the answer, but you also know that you will never be exactly right in your deductions.  You may have an idea as to the guilty, but you cannot say hand on heart that you are right and why you are right.  If you do not believe me, read a couple of the short ones.<br />This complete collection of the Holmes stories brings together the longer stories and the full length novel that is &quot;Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; with the numerous number of shorter stories that are completed in about 30 minutes.  They provide an excellent curio to read before sleep and a serious challenge if you attempt to dissect the evidence and beat Holmes at his own game.  I always like to chance my arm as to the villain, but, apart from a few good efforts, I tend to be way off.  The enjoyment then comes from having Holmes explain it to you.  A simple formula, really, but one which Conan Doyle uses often and refreshingly well.<br />The beauty is that you know what you are getting with Holmes and the final solution to each problem seldom disappoints.  The stories also provide an insight to the times; Holmes' use of cocaine, the acceptable opinions of the day and the people of London in Queen Victoria's time.<br />This book is simply unbeatable.
B00004Y6O7|5.0|Fair Warning brings a certain darkness to Van Halen's music, as can be seen by the disturbing artwork used for the album's cover. The album seems geared towards the seedier side of life with songs about prostitutes and the tough city streets. Musically, this is perhaps the second strongest VH album, their debut being the only thing better. Unfortunately this album was followed by a collection of cover songs (Diver Down)that didn't force the band to grow and DLR-era VH never regained the form they showed here even though 1984 came close.
B00004X01U|5.0|Wow! When I got this CD in the fall last year I listened to it once, then put it away for a while to spin Ricky Martin's newest effort. I actually forgot about this one for a while until I cleaned out my CD rack last weekend. I put this on to pass the time and found myself stopping dead in my tracks to listen to the stirring &quot;What It Feels Like For a Girl.&quot;  I couldn't help it. When the chorus came on the first time, I even felt a little like crying. I think that most of the album is superficial and over fabricated in that every song uses voice digitalization. However, try to grasp the meaning of the songs beneath the annoying vocals. The best tracks are &quot;Nobody's Perfect,&quot; &quot;Don't Tell Me,&quot; and &quot;What It Feels Like For a Girl.&quot; I don't mind &quot;Music,&quot; but it's not a personal favorite. <br />Though Madonna does talk through most of the songs that aren't digitalized, the songs that are really good ARE really good. The excellent tracks make up for the bad ones. If you liked &quot;Oops I Did It Again&quot; I think you'll like this, too. (Madonna has a much stronger voice than Britney.) Give it a listen. I don't think you'll be dissappointed.
B000001ZS8|3.0|&quot;Ethnicolor&quot;, &quot;ZOOLOOK'S&quot; opener, is an utter masterpiece and must've been one of the first all-sampled voice compositons, beating DEEP FORREST and DELERIUM'S music by almost a decade. The album is worth having for this piece alone, but unfortunately it's a steady decline from there. &quot;Diva&quot; is sassy, cute and goofy. Then there's the typical Jarre dance stuff (Zoolougie and Zoolook). &quot;Cafe Blah-Blah&quot; is a humorous bit, obviously inspired by the cantena scene in STAR WARS and could easily have been background music for that scene. Finally, we piddle out with &quot;Ethnicolor 2&quot; which seems tacked on for filler. The rest of the album isn't awful, it's just &quot;Ethnicolor&quot; is a such hard act to follow nothing else CAN match.
B000001DU5|5.0|Im 18, and while I was growing up I constantly heard the song &quot;Everybody Wants To Rule the World&quot;, and I never ever grew tired of it. When I look back at my childhood and all the music I was infatuated with, only one group ever truly stood out--this one. What the hell happened to music in the 90's?! Most importantly the sound. Well at least we have this group to hold onto, and the one of a kind songs they gave us. No other group in the 1980's had that particular sound and execution of style,(The Talking Heads comes close) originality and surreal evocative feeling that this group had in almost all of their songs. Everybody Wants to rule the world is in my opinion the best and most memorable song that came out in this sadly missed decade. &quot;Shout&quot; is another memorable and thought provoking tune--and of course &quot;Head Over Heels&quot;-the most defining song of infatuation and true love-and a beautiful song as well.It was interesting to be a kid in the 80's--all the addictive cartoons and toys. But I so wish I could have been a teen- to better grasp and appreciate the mood and feel of the decade. The music, movies-Blue Velvet is the best movie I have ever seen-just everything about it. We now only have our bittersweet memories to cherish.And Tears For Fears is one group I will always listen to, to remind me of all those unforgetable times.
B000001FFJ|3.0|I love Tom Waits, ever since &quot;I Don't Want To GrowUp.&quot; What a rare gem!  It's so hard to find rare gems that aren'talso lame. If you like Tom Waits, then check out Chris Black and theHoly Ghosts.  (I just found out about this Austin, TX-based bandmyself.) Use a search engine to locate their very interesting website.Chris Black's old band was Shoulders, who were once ranked #2 onFrance's top billboards.
0679746048|5.0|Kaysen writes a great representation of the dark jumble inside her head as she does about the hospital routines, the staff, and the patients.  All the people (celebrities, patients, and staff) are memorable such as:  Ray Charles, Sylvia Plath, Robert Lowell, Susan (thin and yellow), and Daisy (laxatives and chicken).  Susan Kaysen is able to tell her story with humor and irony.  Moreover, it is a straightforward account of the inmantes' experiences, capturing their fears, their quirky bravery and their solidarity as misfit teens.  This is a great book for young adults which may be experiencing much of the same.
B000001FFJ|5.0|This kind of music is awesom. Mr Waits knows how to emphasize feelings with music by using unusual Instruments. The power of this album is hard to put in words. There are songs like &quot;JOCKEY FULL OF BOURBON&quot; which want to make you start to dance. But there are also Ballads like &quot;TIME&quot; or &quot;DOWTTOWN TRAIN&quot; which want to make you smile and cry at the same time. So lets buy it.

0440234743|2.0|Grisham has built his reputation on the superb suspense of &quot;The Pelican Brief,&quot; &quot;The Client,&quot; and &quot;The Firm.&quot;  &quot;The Testament&quot; is the first, but not the only one, of his books that I find distasteful because he has begun to show an unflattering tendency to moralism. I want Mr. Grisham to entertain me, not to instruct me.  This novel is spoiled by an alcoholic lawyer who meets a missionary, then travels the long, long road to god and redemption on the reader's dime.  If I want inspiration, I will seek it out.  The book did not give me the wonderful reading experience that the first three did.
B00004TH6O|2.0|The first album was so good, but this one doesn't even compare. If it wasn't QOTSA, I'd toss it in the trash. I figure maybe the more I listen to it, the less I'll hate it. If you don't have the first album, definitely get it instead. If you have to have &quot;R&quot;, go to any record store. They'll have about 20 copies they're selling for 5 bucks because nobody wants it.
0060922583|5.0|&quot;Sit down before fact like a child, and be prepared to give up every preconceived notion, follow humbly wherever and to whatever abyss Nature leads, or you shall learn nothing.&quot;<br />-T.H. Huxley, as quoted by Michael Talbot<br />&quot;...don't be afraid. Once you have overcome your 'fear of the water', I think you'll find swimming among quantum physics' strange and fascinating ideas much easier than you thought.  I think you'll also find that pondering a few of these ideas might even change the way you look at the world...&quot;<br />-page 8, Introduction<br />&quot;Miracles happen, not in opposition to nature, but in opposition to what we know of nature.&quot;<br />-St. Augustine, as quoted by Michael Talbot, page 119<br />&quot;The idea that the universe began in a single primordial explosion, or Big Bang, is accepted without question by most scientists.   And this is odd because, although there are compelling reasons to believe that this is true, no one has ever proved that it is true.   On the other hand, if a near death psychologist were to state flatly that the realm of light NDE-ers travel to during their experiences is an actual other level of reality, the psychologist would be attacked for making a statement that cannot be proved.   And this is odd, for there are equally compelling reasons to believe this is true.   In other words, science already accepts what is probable about very important matters IF those matters fall into the category of 'fashionable things to believe', but not if they fall into the category of 'unfashionable things to believe'.   This double standard must be eliminated before science can begin to make significant inroads into the study of both psychic and spiritual phenomena...<br />...We are, as the aborigines say, just learning how to survive in infinity.&quot;<br />-Michael Talbot, THE HOLOGRAPHIC UNIVERSE<br />This book is so exahustively researched, so well thought out, so cleary elucidated and full of points clearly delinated such that practically anyone with any level of familiarity with the scientific ideas presented (including none whatsoever) will walk away from it having at the very least a cursory, metaphor-producing understanding... all on the most provocative and most important subjects mankind could ever talk about in this new century.  If ever you questioned if we are living in transformative, paradigmatic, *apocalyptic* times the likes of which have not been experienced on earth before--with simliar ideas changing the world only centuries ago-- this book will confirm it for you.<br />Michael Talbot's holonomic and holistic approach to this fundamental shift in our understanding of the known universe, and what its implications are, will resonate in your heart, more than your mind.  This book is a bridge to higher learning--of both a scientifc and a spiritual nature.  It bridges the intuitive and the intellectual, the creative and the scientific; the scientific, spiritual, cultural, and creative persepctives on the universe into one all encompassing whole.<br />I highly recommend it.  It is absolutely wonderful.
0385495323|3.0|So OK, I'm one of those people that has to read the book all the way through.  I can't stop reading something once I've started because then it would be like some kind of defeat or something.  And with this book I had gotten into a big discussion with my brother about whether I would really read it or if I was just clicking away on Amazon at things that I might like but wasn't really, really interested in.  So I had something to prove. The upshot is that I wanted to stop reading this book but I couldn't, so it started to annoy me.  I liked the subject a lot and I think the author's style was very accessible, his writing was &quot;readable&quot;, as they say.  What annoyed me unfortunately was his enthusiasm.  At times he would strive to point out what geniuses these guys were and how their contribution changed the course of history and how cryptography is this great unheralded scientific and cultural discipline.  Alright already, I get it.  It's all so amazing.  Got it.  I can see that the men and women that made great strides in cryptography had minds that worked in &quot;special&quot; ways.  I enjoyed hearing the stories.  It just got old in the end and the world of cryptography started to seem less like spies and covert-Op's and more like a Trekkie convention.
0792151720|5.0|Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane and Victor Garber star in the theatrical hit of 1997: TITANIC. Leonardo DiCaprio was terrific as Jack Dawson. Kate Winslet was so-so in this movie. Billy Zane ( Cleopatra, The Phantom and Pocahontas II) gave a slamming punch-in-the-face performance as the gentlemanly jealous Cal Hockley. Should have won 2 MORE Academy Awards: Best Actor (Dicaprio) and Best Supporting Actor (Zane). I LOVE the song My Heart Will Go On; it makes me cry because it means something personal to me. Why wasn't the song In My Arms Again by Michael W. Smith used in the movie? GREAT picture.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|Buy this album, quit reading, GO GO GO!!! Amazing stuff. Best punk band since Fugazi. I can't quit listening to it, their raw energy is amazing. It is very accessable, and loud, but has an edge to it that separates it from any other emo-core/indie/punk whatever bands out there. Buy this CD, you won't be disappointed, and if you are, there are plenty of people out there how won't be that you can re-sell it to.
B00000J7S8|5.0|On her previous albums, her style had a tendency to change from one song to the next; so did her intonation, even her phrasing. It was disconcerting. But on this album everything comes together and she's consistent throughout. It's a splendid collection of tunes, beautifully delivered and buttressed by restrained yet classy piano playing; a joy to hear. She's just going to get better and better, now that she's found the right level.
B000002JSV|5.0|The fact that this is one of the least-known of the Bon Scott-era AC/DC efforts just proves that attention isn't necessarily lavished on the most deserving. There's not a weak link in this whole chain of bluesy, keister-kickin' numbers. &quot;Sin City&quot; and &quot;Gimme a Bullet&quot; may well be two of the most &quot;unknown classics&quot; of the entire hard-rock genre. If you own this disc (or album!), you know what I'm talkin' about ... if you don't, what's your problem ?!?
0064407667|5.0|I came to this series as a result of an interview with the author that I read in Publishers Weekly. Intrigued, I ordered the first three books. I loved them. They are purportedly children's books but the author has a wicked sense of humor, and includes references that only adults would recognize. (For example, two of the three children are named Sunny and Klaus. Gee, that makes me think about some real-life wicked goings-on.)<br />Aside from everything else, these children actually come alive; they're inventive, clever and resourceful. They also suffer at the hands of their wonderfully conceived evil uncle Count Olaf.<br />I've passed these books along to a number of children who gobbled them up as avidly as I did--which proves that a good book knows no age barriers. This series is pure pleasure.
630460291X|4.0|A kick back and enjoy film. One you don't have to think about much to enjoy. I thought all the actors did a fine job. The DVD is basic. No extras to speak of, but this isn't a film that requires deep analysis. You have to take it for what it is. Its a very good value for what it delivers; A few hours of enjoyment.
B00004U30D|1.0|Contrary to to what everyone seems to think, the original screenplay of &quot;American Beauty&quot; *was* changed. <br />(note that the following will ruin the ending)<br />In the original script, Lester succeeds in having sex with Angela on the couch, and she confesses her virginity after. In comparison with Lester's character throughout the rest of the film, this is inconsistent, and was changed solely to give him a false epiphany, and evoke sympathy from the audience when his brains were blown out. If he had sex with her and then found out about her virginity, it would have made more sense, would have been more powerful and poignant in a less sentimental, gimmicky way, and, like so few movies in cinema history, might have been a real tragic masterpiece.<br />I am awfully suspicious of that Steven Spielberg story. It reeks of the kind of rumor people make up to make a movie seem incredibly great, hiding the truth. If you read the PUBLISHED screenplay, Alan Ball's preface recalls another instance where the original script was changed. <br />Don't be so gullible.<br />What happened to the &quot;American Beauty&quot; script happens to virtually every movie you will ever see in a conglomerate theatre. Unfortunately, it is only the lesser-known independent films, of which everyone seems to have a preconcieved bias against, that maintain integrity. Expand your horizons and discover the pure art of cinema.
0452281881|5.0|Brilliant and funny! I cried laughing.  I lost my breath laughing.  If there has been anything published in this century that is funnier, I would like to know.  Not since Mark Twain translated the Jumping Frog back from the French to Englist have I laughed as much.  Yes, I think you have to have worked in a corporate environment to really appreciate it as much as I have but then I've met a lot of those characters.  Congratulations to Matt Beaumont.  How can you ever top this?
0375703764|1.0|Keeeeeeripes!  I read the other reviews and was intrigued by the idea of weaving time.  The only time shift I found was the daunting feeling that the dang thing was never going to end.  The only reason I was compelled to read more was because I couldn't wait to finish it to see if something meaningful would actually happen.  700 pages and the answer... nope.  An obvious first-time authors attempt to use all the [stuff] he accumlated writing reports and &quot;being creative&quot; in college.  In fairness, the story(ies) would've been an interesting 150 pages.  The rest - dead trees...
B00004XONN|5.0|Folks, this is what music should be.  It is hands down the best album in recent memory.  Radiohead is the Beatles of the 20th century.  They are creating new and profoundly beautiful music.  This is an album that will stand the test of time, and this is a band that should be highly revered for it's bravery in releasing such a ground breaking album.  In a time when people think that Limp Bizkit is the future of rock and roll, this is a welcome change.  THIS is the future of rock and roll.  Doing what you want to do, not what the public wants you to do.
B00000K19E|5.0|Just as the movie began to take off, it suddenly hit me that the whole thing can be viewed as a metaphor for spiritual growth.<br />This is one of the most inspired, complete films ever made. The weak spots are few--even Keanu is good.<br />In the years since it's been out, there's been a lot of discussion about whether this movie is as good as some people think it is, whether it's original, whether it's entertaining.<br />I can't answer that for you--you need to see it for yourself.  For me, this movie brought together a lot of personal questions and actually led me to a place where it was possible to \\"free my mind.\\"<br />It's slick, moody, and arguably original in presentation and content. The acting is great for an action flick. It's worth watching, and like any movie where the cast and crew gave their best effort, it might teach you something.  Or it might not.<br />Maybe it's not the best movie ever made, but I've found that any film that people argue about for years deserves attention.
0920668372|1.0|On the surface, it's a really sweet book about a mother who really loves her baby boy as he grows to manhood, no matter how goofy or annoying he may be in the process.  Periodically she visits him and sings the song.If it were just that, it'd be an all time classic.  But it takes the simple concept to disturbing extremes that have to be seen to be believed.  Anyone who's had a baby in their family knows there's nothing cuter than looking at them while they're sleeping.  The mother in the book knows this and sneaks into his room at night to peek at her angel, and sing her little song to him.  Nothing wrong with that, right?<br />Only it doesn't stop there.  When the boy is a teenager she CRAWLS into his room on all fours and, &quot;If he was really asleep she picked up that great big boy and rocked him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth&quot; while she sang her song.  I don't know about you but if I was 15 and woke up in my bed with my Mom holding me like that, I'd probably scream.  Who knows what kind of weird dreams this poor boy was having?<br />Well at least when this poor lad moves out of the house, he won't have to deal with his mother's obsessive habits anymore...or does he?  Yep, once he's full grown, according to the book, &quot;...sometimes on dark nights his mother got into her car and drove across town.&quot;  YIKES!  Not only is that scarier than hell that she's driving with a ladder strapped to her car in the middle of the night, but she makes a regular habit of it.  Mommy climbs up his house, crawls through his window and does the same thing.  Man this guy sleeps better than anyone I've ever known!  Well, you can see by looking at this small single bed that he never got married.  And he had such a healthy upbringing, too.<br />Though the book takes a poignant dramatic turn when he hears his mother isn't doing well and he goes to visit her.  As he holds his dying mother in his lap, he turns the tables and sings the song to her.  But wait a minute!   I thought he was asleep during all those other times.  Looks like he was playing along with this little sick little game a little too eagerly. At this point, you feel bad for making fun of the book at all 'cause his mother has passed away.  The son returns home, though, and picks up his baby girl and sings the song to her.  <br />But from everything we've seen in the book, the guy lives alone.  The only woman he ever sees at night is his Mom.  Leaving the only possible mother of his child to be...OH MY GOD!!!<br />If you still think this book is sweet and that I'm missing the true spirit of LOVE YOU FOREVER, just switch the genders of the characters in this story and tell me that wouldn't be extra creepy.
B000002UJQ|5.0|There's no break-out hit on this album, no \\"Creep,\\" no \\"Just.\\" Instead, there's a seamless exploration of alienation in a world of technology.<br />The album runs from start to finish without a break: even the brief silences between tracks are blended perfectly into the sound, as though the music were taking a breath before continuing.<br />The truly amazing thing, though, is the Zen nature of the album. Rarely have I found an album where I don't anticipate an upcoming song, or guitar lick or lyric. When I listen to OK COMPUTER, I'm totally in the moment, experiencing the music as it happens.<br />This album has been in the CD changer of my car for 2 weeks now, and when it ends, I simply start it again.<br />The album's not for everyone--my ex-wife didn't care much for Radiohead until the time came to divide up the property--but many people will find it a transcendent experience.
0380002930|5.0|You can read the other reviews to learn what the story line is...I just wanted to say I love this book every time I read it.  It keeps me enthralled, it is adorable, sensitive and just charming.  One of the books in my permanent library.
B00000K2SC|5.0|Although I didn't find this film to be as profound as many of the other reviewers did, it is certainly clever and very smartly written.  I was impressed at how smoothly the Wachowskis managed to fit the conventions of martial arts films into a technological context.  The story is pure comic book--and I mean that in the best sense of the word.  A seemingly average guy meets some mysterious types who introduce him to the reality behind our everyday world and becomes a superhero to battle the evil he finds there.  One of the most interesting facets of the story is the fact that our heroes exist in two worlds simultaneously--in one they are superhuman, while in the other they are nearly helpless.
B000006NPY|4.0|After the extravagant and daring 'Mellon Collie...' Billy Corgan and Co took rock music to a quieter place. This album could have so easily backfired and become a self-indulgent flop in the hands of lesser bands, but as this is the multi-talented Smashing Pumpkins, they pull it off...just. It is an album that will get better with age and will be hailed as a masterpiece in years to come but in 1998 it was misunderstood.<br />The raging guitars have disappeared that is sure to disappoint many hardcore fans to be replaced with gentle and aching melodies. The first single 'Ava Adore' is the most full-on track here with its pulsating rhythms while second single 'Perfect' is almost pop perfection. Other highlights include 'Pug', 'For Martha' and 'Daphne Descends'. At times songs such as 'For Martha' and 'The Tale Of Dusty And Pistol Pete' go on far too long when the album could have been cut in length to a more appropriate running time. But with every Smashing Pumpkins release, 'Adore' is longer than necessary leaving the listener hitting the fast forward button. <br />In retrospect, the band made a wrong turn into the electronic genre, proved right by the buying public shunning the record. It was the album that the general public started to lose interest in the Pumpkins which resulted in the band's break-up. However, the quality of music cannot be denied no matter what instruments Billy Corgan uses.
B000002NIW|5.0|This really is one of the best albums of all time. I'm not just saying that as one of those stupid fans that every band has. There is no bad song on this album. From the opening drums in My Own Summer to the last chord of the hidden track, everything is perfect. This band is unbelievably underated (very few people can sing like Chino). The best song is definetly the hidden track &quot;Damone&quot;, unfortunately you have to fast froward through over twenty minutes of silence to get to it. If you liked White Pony, get this the first chance you get. But if you like Metallica, Godsmack, or Disturbed, DO NOT buy this album. You'll just throw it away for lack of stupid angry songs about nothing.
B000002I27|5.0|I love The Doors; I love their music; I love this album(CD). I can listen to this over and over again without getting tired of it. Robby Krieger's talented guitar solos are prominent in most songs (You're Lost Little Girl, When The Music's Over, Moonlight Drive) and what I think makes this CD great. Morrison's vocals are right on target and haven't lost their edge yet as in later albums. A great follow-up to their unbelievably astounding debut album. A must-have for all Doors fans!
6305161879|4.0|'A Fish Called Wanda' accomplishes what many have not. A comedy with a rediculous premise, made believable by the casting.  John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis and thier supporting actors are terrific.  Just enough Monty Python.
B00001PE4D|5.0|I have seen every movie adaptation of &quot;Les Liasoins Dangereuse&quot; that has been made.  Dangerous Liasons would probably be my favorite because i love the cast, the tension in the storyline and the pace at which the movie runs...  &quot;Valmont&quot; with Annette Bening and fairuza Balk was a little slow and kind of awkward to watch, but i liked it..  However..  None of them was as entertaining as &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot;.  This movie took the cruelty of Katherine and the innocense of Cecille to a whole new level..  sarah Michelle Gellar could not have played this role any better..  Selma Blair portrayed the young innocent twit to the hilt, and you actually get to feel sorry for Valmont..  Malkovich couldnt have worked his magic nearly as well as Phillippe did..  This is a must see movie for anyone, any age who wants to be entertained and see the bad girl get whats coming to her..
0345440757|5.0|Wow -it is so fantastic to finally have a simple, relevant and &quot;easy&quot; book to read, focusing on the issues all parents (new or not so new) spend many sleepless hours thinking about (eating, sleeping, feeding, how to prepare for your new baby etc....).<br />When I first became pregnant, I bought many &quot;parenting&quot; and &quot;baby&quot; books, some were good, others not so good.  The problem was I found I needed &quot;many&quot; books.  Every time I had a question, I would look through this huge stack of books next to my bed trying to find a comprehensive answer!<br />One night after finally getting my baby to sleep at 1:00 a.m., I found myself wide awake, unable to fall asleep.  So I picked up &quot;Secrets of the Baby Whisperer&quot; and couldn't put it down.  I stayed up till 3:30 that morning reading the entire book.  <br />This book offers such non judgemental, practical information, covering so many relevant topics.  The author's sweet and loving manner comes through in her writing, and makes you feel that she is talking to only you.    I strongly encourage all parents to get &quot;Secrets of the Baby Whisperer.&quot; This is a must read!
630522577X|2.0|This is a sumptuous production, with glorious costumes, production design,sound, and Rex Harrison as the Professor. What makes this a freakish musical to me is that the leading lady can't even sing. She's dubbed. All the way through you see poor Audrey Hepburn pouring her heart out as she pretends to mimic the lyrics. Dubbing the singing voices of stars is hardly new. Ava Gardner was dubbed in &quot;Showboat&quot;, although her voice was perfect (as the pre-recordings prove). But then Ava wasn't the real focus of attention in &quot;Showboat.&quot; kathryn Grayson and Howard Keel were and oh, man could they sing. Audrey Hepburn was chosen only because at that time she was an old-fashioned &quot;Star!&quot; The old studio system demanded that only a real &quot;STar!&quot; should star in a stupendous musical like &quot;My Fair Lady.&quot; Audrey was reportedly heart-broken Oscar ignored her. Why? Because there were other people besides me who thought it bizarre that an entire musical was built around a performer who couldn't sing a note. Julie Andrews proved that she could not only sing in Mary Poppins but that she had that shimmering star quality that only a few possess.  Those who heard Andrey Hepburn sing in real life said it was best the paying public didn't hear her. She had zero singing talent.
B000059XYK|3.0|You've got to remember, at heart, &quot;Gone In 60 Seconds&quot; is a summer movie, therefore devoiding it of being a major oscar contender etc. Jerry Bruckheimer's trademark of fast car chases and loud noises isn't ignored here. Nicolas Cage plays retired car thief Memphis Raines, now employed as a mechanic, who comes out of retirement to bail his little brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) out of trouble with a lethal boss after screwing up what could have been a very big payoff. Employing his old friends including the likes of a Yoda like garage owner (Robert Duvall), Sphinx, a mysterious thief with a face that you wouldn't want to mess with, and Donny, a neurotic DMV employee, all of them former car thieves now with respectable jobs as well as Kip's crew. Meanwhile detective Delroy Lindo and partner Timothy Olyphant are cops on Memphis' trail with Lindo eager to capture Memphis for years. Obviously there are going to be spectacular car chases of which there is including a finale with Memphis. The only thing about Gone In Sixty Seconds is it seems to be missing something, despite the appearance of a very attractive Angelina Jolie, there seems to be something that could've made the film better than it really is. The performances are excellent as they always are in a Bruckheimer produced film with Dominic Sena providing the moody visuals he used in Kalifornia. All in all, Gone in 60 Seconds plays better on tape than on the movie screen.
B000002H6C|5.0|..And Justice For All, in my opinion, is Metallica's best album. Though horrbily produced, this album is one of the fews cd's on the market in which EVERY track is enjoyable. I listen to this album everyday and i am still not sick of it. My only complaint with this album is i can't hear any bass. The Drums also sound like Lars is playing over the telephone...<br />Tracks:<br />1. Blackened: GREAT song! very fast throughout the entire song...amazing riffs...awesome Lyrics similar to &quot;Fight Fire With Fire&quot; (Ride the Lighting). Great intro as well.<br />2. ...And Justice For All: Amazing song.  Although VERY long, i still listen to the song entirely. The intro is awesome and the lyrics discuss the Amercian court system and its many cracks. A bit repetitive, but still Execellent<br />3. Eye of the Beholder: Good song. The riffs are arranged very well and the drums are great. This is the song i listen to the least, but i still like it.<br />4. One: How the hell can a Metallica fan not love this song? in a word or two: UNBEILEVELY GREAT! The most famous song on the album. Starts out slow but ends in machine gun- like guitar riffs.<br />5. The Shortest Straw: VERY good song. Fast the entiire way. Awesome riffs and the solo is great. If produced better, this song would proabably be the best sounding track Metallica has ever recorded.<br />6. Harvester of Sorrow: Great Song. Best intro of the cd. Lyrcisc are great and the guitars are amazing<br />7. The Frayed Ends of Sanity: Probably the best title for a song I've heard. GREAT SONG. Amazing riffs. The Best solo Kirk has ever done. Great ending.<br />8. To Live Is To Die: OK. This song alone proves how GREAT Metallica is. This is my all-time favortie Metallica song. a 10 minute tribute to former bassist Cliff Burton (R.I.P) who died in a buss accident. I listen to this song EVERYDAY. Its amazing beyond description. The band's sorrow is felt every second. My only complaint with this songs is that they never play itlive. <br />9. Dyers Eve: Great closing track. Heavy the entire time. Great lyrcis and guitar riffs are lighting quick..<br />Overall: I can't say it enough: THIS IS THE BEST METALLICA ALBUM EVER! I you are a fan of Master of Puppets and earlier, you will love this album. Fans of new work like Load and Re-load will be in for a suprise...but this is a amazing album...That's all that matters.
0451197968|5.0|I read several Stephen King books before attempting this one. No, it wasn't long like 'The Stand' or 'Bag of Bones', and in fact, it is one of his shorter books, just over 300 pages long. But I saw the movie, and, well, I hated it. I thought it was terrible, really, and somehow I thought the book might be the same. I am aware that books are nearly always better, but come on! How could a movie go so astray from the book? It seemed to happen here. <br />First, the book is broken into 100 chapters, and at 300 pages for the book, each chapter is only about 3 pages long. I think the longest is 5, which means you breeze straight through it in less than a day if you try. The action is non-stop, the plot is great, and you're hoping that Ben Richards survives when you close it again. However, with such a great plot and ideas, this book should have been longer. LONGER?! Yes, I know, I never thought I would want a Stephen King book to be longer, but this one should have...I just hated to see it end. <br />Since reading it, I have borrowed the book to a few friends, and they all love it, too. (Much for the same reasons!) There are no monsters or spirits in this book, but a man fighting for survival in the near future. And with CBS's 'Survivor' and ABC's 'The Mole' now airing on TV, it looks like the world may soon reach 'The Running Man'. That's what makes this book so scary; it's just too real for words. So if you're looking for a quick read--like for a roadtrip or for a plane flight--or just for your own enjoyment, grab this one. But if you're looking for something to get completely involved with for the next 3 months, think about a different title. You'll love the characters, but it might not be long enough for some people.
B00004SCX6|1.0|Absolute trash..has a deservant place in the bin, not taking up all the space in record shops!<br />The shops could be filled with far better CD's, like those of James, U2, Bluetones etc.  But..there filled with this teenage-appealing trash.<br />It's not even worth the disc it is written on.  I would've given it no stars had I had the choice.
0805062971|5.0|If you had given me the book without the movie, I probably would have given this 4 stars and dismissed it as a &quot;good idea.&quot;  This, however, is an excellent supplement to the movie and is a must read for all.
0671015206|5.0|Were I to have one book to study when I was a freshman in high school, &quot;The Millionaire Next Door&quot; would be the one.  It isn't  future millionaires who would benefit most by studying this book. That 2% will get there.  It is the other 98 percent of us who could benefit by it's content.  Not everyone can become a millionair, however, if you practice what this book preaches, you won't see welfare checks arriving in the mail.  The simplicity and common sense written on it's pages, make this book easy to read and understandable to even the most challenged.  Through away that Economics 101 book. Read The Millionaire Next Door and you will be further ahead.
0553296981|4.0|I think that this book is a wonderful example of how the Jews were treated. The book gives inside imformation and helps anyone to understand The Holocaust. This was a terific book to read because it really told how everything was and how it happened during that point and time. I feel really sorry for what they had to go through and everything but this was a great book. The only think that I would suggest is that if you don't like sad books, then maybe this is not the book for you. The book was interesting and had a lot to offer people who want to find out about what people had to go through. I think that we can't really say, oh this is sick or anything because they went through a lot and we need to have some respect for them. My social studies teacher is the one who brought that to my attention and I think that we do need to have some respect for them. I enjoyed reading the book and hopefully you will to. the book will help you on history projects also! Hope that this will intrest readers enough to read it. This is really a book that you can't explain very well. I believe that if you will read it, you will love it!!!
0345350499|2.0|The first time I read this book, I was impressed by the depth of knowledge it revealed but at the same time I couldn't stand the way some of the characters were portrayed.  The great King Arthur was actually weak and let himself be led around by the petty Gwenhwyfar, who was too dense to see anything past her precious Lancelot and her blind opinions about her religion.  This book seemed to include men solely for the purpose of being used by the women.  Although this book provided an interesting point of view on the Arthurian Legends including its relationship to Avalon, I highly recommend that you read anything else.
6303160344|5.0|'Bleu' is a movie which seems impossible to understand in one single viewing: it has many, many layers. The key to understanding is the meaning of its color, Blue which stands for Liberty. It explores every aspect of this subject in an unusual, philosohical, subtle way.  Is 'liberty' equal to 'indifference' or 'freedom', 'absolute freedom of choice'; 'freedom to act'? Is it the same as 'solitude' or does it mean 'absolute nothingness'? <br />Notice the cross-references to the other 'colors' of the trilogy. Children dressed in white bathingsuits with red floaters jumping into the blue swimming-pool; Binoche 'accidentally' entering the court-room where the main Polish character of 'White' is pleading his innocence; Red in the prostitute neighborhood; etc. <br />Bleu is the most important of the trilogy, for it threads all three together, mainly by the text of its music (Bible, Corinths 1), adding almost like a fourth color, Love:<br />&quot;Though I speak with the tongues of angels, If I have not love... My words would resound with but a tinkling cymbal. [etc.]&quot;<br />Kieslowski is like a Rembrandt in his use of color and light, and during his lifetime, poorly understood. His works and thoughts are brilliant but not easy to understand at first - one must chew on it before understanding shimmers. This trilogy requires YOU to think. The Maestro didn't do it for you! When asked, 'What does this or that movie of yours actually mean?', Kieslowski grinned, and cunningly, brilliantly answered, 'I don't know, that's up to the audience!'
B000051VWW|5.0|I am almost at a lost for words.  This is one of the very best records, CDs, or more accurate yet, collections of music ever made.  It is a luscious blend of pop, jazz, and simply ethereal other worldly music.  It is Romantic in the very best sense of the word.  Yet, there is at least one composition, Imigrant, decrying racism. I believe that Imigrant is the most potent and spiritually moving protest song every written.  Every track is superbly produced and Sade's voice is resonantly beautiful. &quot;Every Word&quot; makes you remember every broken romance you have ever experienced, but with warmth, loving kindness, and bittersweat tears.  One listen and you want to give it to everyone you know, certainly everyone you love--which will be more people than you ever thought possible after you have listened to it.
B00004Z4WR|4.0|Ok, lets start with the critics, they did not enjoy this movie at all. So What! Does that mean you wont? Depends on your style of movie. I loved it, but I grew up on Burt Renolds rampaging through various enviorments, smashing up various patrol vehicles. This is a modern version of that, with a little Blues Brothers thrown in. Everyone says this movie has no plot. Like running a truckload of beer in limited time was a plot, or saving an orphanage by throwing a concert while on the lamb. This movie is designed for enjoyment purposes. No sitting around looking for the next plot twist, or trying to figure out &quot;who done it&quot;. Just sit back, relax, feel the testosterone flow, and enjoy. This movie is an &quot;in your face&quot; car chase flix. Remember, its a remake of a 70's cult favorite B movie. Key words here, &quot;70's&quot; and &quot;B movie&quot;. Bear that in mind when renting/buying. Your either going to love or hate this movie. I loved it, but then I loved the Bandit, the Blues Bros, Hooper etc etc etc. On another note, the final chase scene could have been longer, and some longer looks at the other 49 cars would have been nice. The 67 GT500 gets coverage, the others get auto cameos. Thats a shame, because there are some hot cars in this movie. Just remember, enjoy it, dont try to &quot;solve&quot; it, or analize it. Its just not built for that, its built for SPEED.
0375501851|1.0|Come on people, this book was highly overrated and plain old boring. I found it quite hard to get through it.  Aside from Clara, characters are vacant and dull.  The author just doesn't take the opportunity to develop personalities enough to conjure up any compassion in the reader.  What could the editorial reviewers have been thinking of when they awarded this book such high praise.
0684853523|5.0|First of all, I should probably mention that I had never read a Stephen King book in my entire life.  I've never had much interest in horror or mystery or suspense.  Naturally, I wasn't sure what to expect, and I was a little wary.  Another motivation for picking up this book was the fact that I've been writing for the vast majority of my life, and I was curious to see if I was on the right track.  I received 'On Writing' for Christmas and read it through a week in January.<br />I was absolutely stunned.  Sure, I respected Mr. King as a successful novelist, and knew a little of his personal life; after this book, I felt like I'd known him personally for years.  As many others have mentioned, this book is really divided into three parts:  a short memoir, a manual of writing technique, and the now well-publicized accident.<br />The first part, &quot;C.V.&quot;, was really glimpses into Mr. King's life, interesting little episodes that he considered life lessons or things that sparked his sense of humor.  It also provides a very important part of a good writer:  He grew up loving to read, and reading frequently.  He also started writing and submitting his work at an early age.  &quot;C.V.&quot; paints the picture of a real-life struggling novelist:  how he had to work at several different crummy (though interesting) jobs while supporting a family, a drug habit, and a hefty manuscript.<br />The second part was &quot;On Writing&quot;.  In this, Mr. King takes almost no credit for what he's saying.  He constantly refers back to 'The Elements of Style' by Strunk &amp; White.  He also gives you, flat-out but not in a patronizing tone, what you need to succeed as a decent writer.  The best way to summarize how I felt about the section as a whole is this:  when he revealed that he taught high school English for several years before the success of 'Carrie', I was desperately jealous of those students.  He'd teach an *awesome* class.<br />I was most impressed by the last section of the book, where he explores his painful memories of the accident and his slow road to recovery.  It literally wrenched my heart when he talked of his wife setting up a table in the stuffy hall that he sat at to write for the first time.  It was obvious that writing is more than just a business occupation--it's obvious Mr. King has a true passion for the craft.<br />I applaud him for it--such people come few and far between.<br />Read this book.  You won't regret it.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|What else can anybody write about the Beatles?  Their music was the greatest since the birth of rock 'n roll, and they indeed shaped a generation.  This is the perfect compilation for those who may not have the original albums
0812550706|5.0|This book is really a pleasure to read.  The story is a great one and the characters are interesting and engaging.  There is an urgency to the plot that captivates you from the start.  What I like about this book the most is that none of the characters are oversimplified.  In fact, the main characters, and in particular Ender, are all quite complicated and unpredictable.<br />The reading is easy.  I poured through this one in a couple of sittings, and if I did that then most of you can read this in a sitting. (slow reader here!)<br />I recommend Ender's Game without reservation.
B0000508U6|5.0|Once again, I feel like I'm living on the wrong side of the pond. <br />Like most of the people who tend not to pick up on groups like this until they're wildly popular, I wasn't introduced to Coldplay until one late night when MTV was actually showing videos (you can't even count on the 5 &amp; 1/2 hour block of music when nobody's awake anymore, so this was truly a miracle).  I saw &quot;Yellow&quot;, and it was intriguing.  Not thinking too much of it, I went on with my life . . . until a few weeks later, when I heard &quot;Yellow&quot; on the radio, then &quot;Shiver&quot; on a separate program.  I had to own this album.<br />And, I wasn't disappointed.  The day I got it (heh, Saturday) I listened to it end to end.  This album just gets better and better.  &quot;Yellow&quot; and &quot;Shiver&quot; are now &quot;old familiar favorites&quot;, but I can honestly say I like every song.<br />The style is in the vein of Radiohead, but there's an added note of optimism and lightness.  Chris Martin brings an almost boyish happiness to the lyrics; the instrumental work is awe-inspiring.  Variety is obviously the spice of life: &quot;Spies&quot;, for instance, has a darker feel than the current US singles.<br />Just like when I saw the video (yeah, that one time), I had a feeling that this album was going to explode; I stil have that inkling.  It has &quot;hit&quot; written all over it (so shame on the person who's selling their copy! :) ).
B00005214X|5.0|Hey, what can one write after 68 (at my point of writing) mostly glowing reviews? Let's put it like that: If in anybody is interesed in knowing what George Harrison is all about, that wonderfully melodious, understated and subtle lead guitarist of the Beatles, and their occasional if highly inspired song-writer, this is the album to get. Harrison, never got any better, or even equalled this feat - &quot;Isn't it a Pity&quot;, eh?. In ATMP Harrison, manages the almost impossible, merging very spiritual lyrics with incredibly beautiful music to create a piece of rock or pop history. Normally, religious coverts just sound awfully contrived or corny when singing about their convictions, but Harrison (a converted Hindu of Hare Krishna denomination) comes across as genuine and deeply inspired by his faith, and the songs are so strong, they would have stood out on any Beatles album. George's gone more Hindu than most Indians, but who cares. The music, which is inspired by his faith, makes the hair stand up on your back - the melodies are just beautiful, pure Harrison. Anybody who likes &quot;Something&quot; or &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; from &quot;Abbey Road&quot; will love ATMP. Pop melodies don't get better than this. And just a bit of information for die-hard Harrison fans: The song title &quot;Wah-Wah&quot; is a pun, mixing together the word for the wah-wah (the guitar gizmo) with the same-sounding Indian word which means &quot;bravo!&quot; or &quot;great!&quot;, in the context of classical Indian concerts. The expression is usually shouted by members of the audience during Indian classical concerts, after especially complex twists of melodies or a very clever play of words, to express their enthusiasm or awe. Don't forget, George knows a bit of classical Indian music. Thus, &quot;You've given me a wah-wah&quot; actually means &quot;you've cheered me on&quot;. Trust me, I'm an India freak myself. All things said, to me ATMP is a sort of desert island disc, one of maybe ten records I will never tire of in my life (or in this incarnation, or whatever). In saying that, I of course refer to the &quot;song part&quot; of the album. Forget about those boring, never-ending jams which I don't even listen to anymore - I just zap them away, and I don't even regard them as being part of the &quot;real&quot; ATMP; they were just a gimmick in line with spirit of the times when the album was originally released, and I wouldn't have minded at bit if they had been omitted for the re-release. Still, all in all, this record is a gift from heaven. I don't know about George's spiritual achievements, but to have created such a timeless, wonderful record should certainly give him tons of good karma and possibly prevent him from having to be re-born. Wah-Wah!
B000002MUW|5.0|The theme of this ablum is: it's lonely at the top. Funky, too. Released in October 1994, Bedtime Stories has a little something for everybody. This is a good thing because after Sex and Erotica were released, everyone wanted a piece of Madonna. Here, she embraces R&amp;B, which sounds like second nature to her. Bedtime Stories features some of her best songs to date. Listening to this disc is very lonely. But it's a beautiful kind of loneliness. There's romance in yearning. The only song Madonna had no hand in writing Bedtime Story, which was written by Bjork and a few others. On Human Nature, Madonna does a lethal counter attack on her critcs saying they punished her for telling them her fantasies. Human nature is one of Madonna's most lethal tracks, but also one of her best. The album kicks off with Survival, and ends with the brilliant ballad Take A Bow. Here are how the tracks rate from 0(bomb)-10++++(outstanding)<br />1. Survival: She ain't no angel, but she'll be living to tell. A great album kickoff! Hey, it's all about survival! 10++++<br />2. Secret: This baby's got a secret. One of her best singles! 10+++<br />3. I'd Rather Be Your Lover: She could be our sister, mother, friend, or brother. Great song! 10+++<br />4. Don't Stop: Great R&amp;B dance track! 10+++<br />5. Inside Of Me: Pretty good. 10<br />6. Human Nature: 2nd best on the CD! Her lethal attack on the critics who said bad things about Erotica. 10++++<br />7. Forbidden Love: This song is lonely, but good. 10+<br />8. Love Tried To Welcome Me: Good song. Not that bad. 10<br />9. Sanctuary: A Very beautiful song! 10+<br />10. Bedtime Story: 3rd best on the CD. Let's get unconsonsious with Madonna. 10+++<br />11. Take A Bow: The best on the CD! A lush, beautiful, heartbreaking ballad! 10++++    <br />Overall Grade: A+ (10+)
0140186395|5.0|This is one novel I read when I want to appreciate the mastery of the writing as well as the pleasure of the story itself.  Steinbeck sure has a way with words!  The story itself is almost the stuff of soap operas - two brothers and a woman one of them marries, twin children abandoned by their mother (the aforementioned woman) who becomes a madam, and a wonderful Chinese character who is never quite what he seems.  But what a wonderful story it is!<br />The characters are very well drawn, and Cathy is one of the best evil characters to fill the pages of a novel in a long time.  There are of course the parralels to Cain and Abel, but that was a fairly simple story, and this one certainly isn't!  A truly great read and one I highly recommend.
B000056K04|5.0|Like, any other devoted fan, i was a little apprehensive about the new album. Switching producers and starting from scratch at the same time the new album was supposed to come out? sounds a little risky. However, when i got my hands on &quot;Everyday&quot;, all doubt was lifted. What inspiring music! The tracks are lively, romantic, and inspiring. My favorites are &quot;the space between&quot;, and the title track. Being a saxophonist, i was a little disappointed with the lack of instrumental solos. but we all know that these will be emblazoned on the summer tour. I can't wait for this album to come out nationwide, so millions of people can allow the Dave mATHEWS band to make their day with their music, EVERYDAY.
B000056VIY|2.0|Perhaps this release should have been delayed after the demise of her relationship with Puffy. There is way too much Puffy influence in this album and it brings the whole thing down.<br />I'm not a big &quot;Bubblegum&quot; Pop fan, but I liked Lopez's &quot;On The Six&quot; album. I was anticipating this album as I looked forward to her second release, and I have to admit, it's disappointing. I didn't expect it to be the same as &quot;On The Six&quot;, but many of these songs, while a scant few are catchy and are destined for massive radio overplay, the rest are very poor.
0525945636|2.0|...nah, not really. Unlike Dr Claude Lucas -(Luke) to those who know him - I have not suffered CIA induced amnesia. What I have suffered is a serious case of disappointment with this Ken Follett book. Something's wrong. Even with previous novels where the plot was thin and the story fairly light ('Night over Water' for example) the one thing you could count on Ken for was historical accuracy and for getting his facts straight. The man is known for spending years on researching his books. This makes the many factual errors here that much more puzzling and annoying. Quite frankly they take you right out of your reverie, or 'world of suspended belief' and that's bad - It's the one thing a fiction writer most wants from his/her reader. I don't think I'm overstating the case, and like some of the reviewers below, I found myself stopped dead my reading tracks by some of the bloopers. Ford Fiesta in 1958, D.C Police called Washington Police, (repeatedly) and Apollo 11 in 1968!. If you have to make a mistake about the date of an Apollo launch, your best bet is not to choose the mission when man first landed on the moon! And lastly, does anyone believe that the CIA and FBI have such lax security systems?<br />I'll stop with the criticisms because these mistakes do not make the book unreadable. Follett is still good with a plot and the style he uses here -with chapter headings being countdown time to the launch of Explorer 1- provided a nice touch and increased the tension as we approached launch. Overall the premise is plausible, the tension is palpable and the plot sufficiently devious. It's just that it is a book that annoyed me more than entertained me, and I forget why.
B000003S2K|5.0|This cd is extremely soothing, it`s the closest thing to church for me. Eno stated when he made this album that he wanted to make music to use on airports, where there is room for interuptions and announcements, he also wanted the music to prepare you for flying. All this he wanted to get a feeling of death where you sort of surrender that fear of flying. Great stuff as i`m qite afraid of flying.
158234082X|5.0|A &quot;friend of a friend&quot; recommended this book for my 19-year-old son, who works in a kitchen and leaves for cooking school in the fall. It arrived via UPS two days ago, and I'm halfway through it already. It's a completely hilarious, reverent, and gritty view of the people who work in kitchens, with a few &quot;how-to&quot; tips thrown in for good measure. <br />This book has helped me to understand what attracted my son to this kind of work, and I know he'll find it not just entertaining, but truly useful in preparing for his career.
B00004X01U|4.0|&quot;Bless London for harboring this lyrical hack and progenitor of recycled trash&quot;<br />&quot;Her Best,more cohesive album to date&quot;<br />&quot;Perfect pop&quot; , &quot;Madonna,you have not been cool since 1985,and you will never will be again!&quot;<br />Love, Hate..the affirmations above are taken from this forum and this is what Madonna creates in people, a reaction, never  indiference.That i think is her most positive achievement. Music is an excellent album, an unexpected pleasure after Ray Of Light, and hell even I ,an ardent fan, could not have predicted this quality of work.The gems are :What it feels like, gone, don't tell me , and Impressive Instant...Why &quot;Music&quot; the single ever made it to #1 remains a mystery o mysteries... Enjoy Music, the latest effort from the reigning Queen Of Pop. (who,unlike the OTHER &quot;monarch&quot; (the bleached one) was NOT self procclaimed ;)  )
0684857219|4.0|I have read a lot of bodybuilding/fitness books, and this is the best, Hands Down!  No book will ever be totally complete, however this book is the closest that I have seen. the book is easy to read and has very clear examples of exercise form and technique.  If you are a beginner, I suggest that you buy a simpler book first to start with, (for the beginner's section of the book could be better).  The area on nutrition also could use some revision.  But, overall, the book is the best.
0792842499|2.0|The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (Sergio Leone, 1967)<br /><br />There are a number of great things about this movie. The first ten minutes. The last ten minutes. The theme music, which has come to be synonymous with the American west. Lee van Cleef, who was great in every role he ever played.<br /><br />And then there was the middle hundred sixty minutes.<br /><br />There's an odd tendency among filmmakers to take a razor-thin plot and stretch it far too long. Such is the case here, with the plot being a race between the Man with No Name (Clint Eastwood), a hired gun named Angel Eyes (van Cleef), and the Man with No Name's on-again off-again sidekick Tuco (Eli Wallach) to find a cache of stolen gold during the Civil War. This plot meanders for two and three-quarters hours before getting on track, and that's about anhour and three-quarters too long. The subplots are never developed, nor are the characters. Tuco switches allegiances every ten minutes. After a while, it gets just plain boring.<br /><br />Definitely could have used a good editor. Eastwood's westerns got better with age (his, not theirs); Unforgiven and Pale Rider are better, tighter films. **
0345440757|5.0|I am a first time mother of an 8 week old son that we were never able to get to sleep at night time, unless we rocked, patted or bounced him for a minimal three hours.  Needless to say bedtime was a nightmare for us.  After reading the chapter on sleep I realized that we missed his early sleep cues and then proceeded to overstimulate him with all the movement.  The night after reading that chapter, we saw the first cues, and immediately laid him down to sleep and just as she described, he fell asleep and has been doing so now for over a week.<br />I have to admit at first I became a bit defensive when I started reading this book, which I now attribute to the fact that I had to admit someone else out there knows more than me about babies.  Once I was able to let go of the defensiveness I really started to get what Tracy was saying and was able to apply it to my son, who I would have catagorized as a &quot;spirted&quot; baby but now realize he's much closer to an &quot;angel&quot;.<br />My husband and I are extremely grateful that Tracy spent the time to share her knowledge.
B000002H33|5.0|This album created, defined, and inspired all metal and brought it from the underground to mainstage.This album is a peice of heavy,yet mellow peice of brilliance in which Metallica had beutiful melodies(welcome home) and thrashing speed explotions (battery).This album also showed perticully good drums by lars, amazing lead guitar by kirk, brilliant vocals by james, and undeniable bass work by cliff(R.I.P.).Metallica made a spark in 1983 that no noe was gonna deny would become huge...and it did.Metallica basically sculpted out the entire blue print for the heavy metal and speed/thrash metal world that came in the next 5 years or so,but they most likely didn't know what they had created in general.At the least, Metallica opened the door to the entire metal world for generations until and generations in the future.
B000050HTO|5.0|It took me 35 years to learn to like Bob Dylan's singing so for you new listeners, don't despair.  Everyone knows he is one of the greatest songwriters ever and his songs have been covered by everyone from The Byrds, Peter Paul &amp; Mary, Clapton, Hendrix, etc., etc. but it takes a while to learn to love his singing.<br />This cd contains all of his early hits except one, &quot;I Miss You&quot; but since I bought this one, I have picked up 5 others and I am now somewhat of an addict as I have to listen to at least one of them every day.<br />My personal favorites on this cd are: &quot;Blowin' In the Wind&quot;, &quot;Like A Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Positively 4th Street&quot;, and &quot;Rainy Day Women # 12 &amp; 35 on the first cd and &quot;Lay, Lady, Lay&quot;, &quot;Knocking On Heaven's Door&quot; and &quot;Hurricane&quot; from cd 2.<br />This is the perfect cd for someone such as myself just starting a collection.
B000002UAI|4.0|Before I got this CD, I assumed from the reviews I had read that this was one of the weakest Beatles albums.  Well, now that I have it, I realize how wrong I was.  This, to me, is the first Beatles album that hints at, even more so than their next one &quot;Help&quot;, the greatness they would achieve on &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; and everything after that.  The sound of this album is a noticeable improvement over &quot;Hard Day's Night&quot;, and for the first time we have John writing more personal lyrics.  I really like all eight Lennon/McCartney compositions here, and some of the covers are quite fun as well (I expecially enjoy Ringo on &quot;Honey Don't&quot;, which contrary to Amazon's track listing, is track 10.  Also, in case anyone doesn't know, &quot;Everybody's Trying To Be My Baby&quot; is track 14.  They really ought to show the full track listing.)  Anyway, this is my favorite Beatles CD of their first five.
B000002U82|1.0|If you are one of the billions of Pink Floyd fans, do not even bother to read any further. Just go to the NO button below and click. I'm sorry, but this elevator music would make a great animal tranquilizer. I bought &quot;The Wall&quot; the same time I bought this one and it is a little better but there is no way in this world that this could be classified as &quot;rock music&quot;. I don't normally review a cd unless I can give it 4 stars or better but in this case I will make an exception. The search continues....
6305810109|5.0|&quot;The Straight Story&quot; is a fantastic mood generator, and David Lynch does an awesome job of casting a magical spell upon your soul as you melt in the breathtaking visuals of midwestern landscapes, and are soothed by the score of Angelo Badalemente.  The acting by Richard Farnsworth is brilliant and heart-wrenching to watch (knowing he was in extreme pain while filming this, and then later taking his own life).  The Straight Story is a mellow movie that is great to unwind and relax to. It's a peaceful journey with an important message at the end of the ride.  Unconditional family love.
B00000HZFP|5.0|This CD is stuck on perpetual play in my car! After seeing the movie at Sundance (it blew me and the entire audience away), I couldn't get the songs out of my head. Part Rocky Horror, part David Bowie, part punk and part glam, this album has some of the catchiest yet edgiest tunes to come along in a long time. I couldn't find nor wait for the film soundtrack so I bought this and was thrilled to see that the music is virtually intact from its Broadway run.  Big hair and big tunes make this an album you've got to have. I can't get enough.
B00003CWTI|5.0|First off, I have to say that this truly is my favorite movie.  The performances are stellar, the art direction is beatiful, and the writing/directing are fabulous.  However, I hear many people complain about how it is a waste of three hours, just because there is no final climax -- For those of you that just enjoy movies following an agonic model (there is a definate start and finish, eventually solving some form of problem/situation), this isn't for you.  For other with an open mind to a more episodic model of a movie, you might enjoy this. So again - this movie is not for everyone -- if you're someone who can't sit through a play, or an opera, you may want to venture away from here.<br />But one last thing -- I notice that 90% of the people that hated the movie mentioned &quot;those stupid frogs,&quot; noting that they were so stupid, and made no sense -- for all of you out there who don't get it -- They ARE a biblical reference to Exodus 8:2 (hence, all of the &quot;82's&quot; in the movie, and a few references to &quot;Exodus&quot;)...The idea is that in the bible, the problem got SO bad, that the only way to solve it was by a miracle that was completely out of the ordinary.  The frogs fall at the climax of each character's story in Magnolia, when nothing logical can make them see the error of their ways...after the falling of the frogs, each person's problem may not be solved, but it seems a little bit more possible to fix it.<br />So that's that -- feel free to still hate it, that's your choice, but realize that not every story needs to necessarily include a start, a middle and an end...all in perfect order.
B000059TEP|4.0|Demi Moore sits at the spinning machine, spinning clay into some kind of vause. Softly, in the background, music plays on her karaoke machine as she crafts her vause. The song ends and the karaoke machine browses through the rest of the records and finally stops on one. The small machine picks up the record and places it on the record player. Suddenly, softly, &quot;Unchained Melody&quot;, the song made famous by THIS movie, starts up. She continues her molding and from behind her Patrick Swayze walks in, wearing nothing but his blue jeans. He sits behind her and their hands meet on the clay and they mold together. They slowly begin to caresse each other and the audience is given a strong sense of love and passion beetween these two characters. We're sure it's meant to be...<br />In &quot;Ghost&quot;, Patrick Swayze gives his best performance ever as Sam Wheat, a man who works at a BAnk and is deeply in love with a woman played by Demi Moore. The both of them seem perfect together in every way. One night, after seeing a play, Sam proposes to her on their walk home through the dark streets. They hug and kiss and you truly think that things are perfect. Suddenly, a strange man approaches them, holding a gun. They try to reason with him, offering a wallet. But Sam is suddenly forced into fighting for his life and then...a shot is fired. Sam chases the man off into the night and seems somewhat pleased that he has one this battle. He calls out to his love and when she does not respond, he turns to see her, lying on the road next to his cold and dead corpse.<br />&quot;Ghost&quot; takes us through Sam's journey as a spiritual being and gives a new and great twist to the after-life. The way the film is shot and acted is perfect in absolutely every way. Patrick Swayze takes on a completely different role than his usually &quot;Schlong&quot; haired characters in films like &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; and he does a fantastic job. Demi Moore is also quite good as the broken hearted Molly, who has lost her love and is tossed into a world of confussion and depression, bearing tears in almost every scene. But, the true shinnig star of the film is Whoopi Goldberg who is absolutely amazing as the Psychic reader who helps Sam on his journey. She brings just the right amount of comedic value to the film which helps it from not turning into an absolutely depressing film.<br />As time goes on in the story, Sam discovers that there was more to his murder than a petty thug looking for money that cold and dark night. Now, with the help of a Psychic (Goldberg), Sam must save the day and his beloved Molly from the other world. But Ghost isn't just a mystery film with the ocassional bit of comedy, but it is also a GREAT love story. It is shown that though Sam does want to help, he would do anything just to be able to touch Molly again and this is shown greatly in one scenec in which &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; is played once again and we are given the same feeling we received at the beggining of the film.<br />So, let me sum up, Ghost is a fantstic film that has a bit of every genre in it and it fantastically done. There isn't one moment in the film where your eyes won't be wide and glued to the screen or they're clinched, watery and leaking. So, for those who are looking for a great film to watch cuddled up with someone you care about on a friday night, Ghost is just the film! A definite keeper!
B000002KNY|5.0|Talking Heads have left me stunned AGAIN!  This album seems to bridge the gap between MORE SONGS and REMAIN.  However, when compared to the previous album (More Songs about Buildings And Food)it doesn't even seem like the same band!  FEAR OF MUSIC is a bit more experimental... the lyrics seem more dark and melancholy (&quot;Heaven  is a place where nothing ever happens&quot;).  Each title seems to only have one word, but each song is unforgettable.  From the start of I ZIMBRA (taken from a phonetic poem by Hugo Ball) one can tell that this album will be like nothing he/she's ever heard.  Probably not for the casual fan or beginning fan... but if you can understand the way this album changed the Heads' style, then it will blow your mind!
B0000062GK|5.0|This CD IS perfection. Perfection from the most perfect guitarists ever. I  have to laugh when I think of all those Hippy loving idiots who still think that Clapton, Hendrix, etc are the best guitar players on the planet, Grow Up! Those people may not like this CD because Joe's music is very complex and requires some intelligence to enjoy. This CD is a journey, an experience. The range of songs is impressive and the modal melodies (Oh my God! He uses more that just the blues scale!)are awe inspiring. If you want recycled licks and songs, get Clapton, Hendrix etc. If you want a really diverse Guitar CD, with beautiful , arrangements, Get This NOW!!!

0451450523|3.0|I read this book when I was 17 and I never read it again.  Like people say, it's poetic and lyrical, but the character development and plot could have been stronger.  At times I would get bored and wish the author spent more time on developing the plot and entertaining me.  Yes, I like to be entertained and in my free time, I don't want to be bored.  The characters are rather dull.  Well I kind of liked the prince, but everyone else needed more work. Overall I did like the concept and I recommend that you check it out from the library.
B000056VIY|1.0|I bought her first cd and it was of the hook. This cd, oh my god thank god i did not WASTE my money on material that does not sound good. Don't get me wrong she sings and dances good on her single but the other songs suck.  Her voice needs a little more toning, she sounds like she has a cold in some of the songs.  The love don't cost a thing,the only bad thing about it is that she repeats everything over and over and over and over. But its got good beat.  If you a true fan you will this cd. My recommendation is borrow it from a friend and give it back cause you don't want to waste your money  on something so terrible. THATS MY OPINION
B00004XOWM|5.0|This CD is the best CD I have ever heard if you have never heard it before oryour son/daughter wants it for some holiday and you don't like music with a lot of swear words i strongly suggest you get the edited version that is the only problem with this CD other than that it is the best CD ever!!!!!!!!
B000056K04|3.0|&quot;Why do I beg like a child for your candy?&quot; a sweet-toothed Dave Matthews asks on &quot;Angel,&quot; a light, reggae-influenced tune whose jovial feel is a rarity on the band's fourth studio album. That type of lyrical artistry hasn't exactly garnered Mr. Matthews much acclaim among music enthusiasts (add it to a stream of ever-clever, not-so-subtle sexual innuendoes ranging from &quot;Open wide/Oh so good I'll eat you&quot; to &quot;Hike up your skirt a little more/Show your world to me&quot;). Ignoring the pedantic critic, Dave and his four Charlottesville, Virginia hombres have achieved mass popularity through their unmatched brand of groove-oriented jams and invigorating live shows.<br />Unfortunately, the quintet's sense of musical homogeneity, fueled by the jocular instrumental interplay of saxophone, violin, bass, drums and acoustic guitar, is absent on Everyday. The album is vocally driven, relying less on the musical pulse that powered the band's past efforts. This reliance on front-end vocals places Matthews' songwriting inadequacies on center stage, nearly sabotaging Carlos Santana's guest guitar work on the morose cultural sewage of &quot;Mother Father&quot; and bogging down &quot;When The World Ends&quot; with his love-sick gibberish.<br />Even with Matthews' occasional raspy intrusions, Everyday has its fair share of beautiful moments, from the surreal euphoria of the single, &quot;The Space Between,&quot; to the instrumental interplay and smooth melodies of &quot;Fool To Think,&quot; to the album's mellow title track. This form of musical cohesion is a rare commodity on Everyday. Leroi Moore's typically standout horn work is reduced to a supplementary status while Boyd Tinsley's crazed fiddling is hidden beneath the over-the-top production efforts of Glen Ballard (Aerosmith, Alanis Morrisette), whose craftsmanship is too calculated for a band whose true expertise lies in avant-garde transitions and climactic breakdowns. <br />In stark contrast to its heavily criticized predecessor Before These Crowded Streets' seven and eight minute epics, no track on Everyday exceeds five minutes, and nearly half clock in under four.<br />Perhaps the most prominent change in sound results from the band's decision to fully utilize electric riffs for the first time on a studio album, eliminating the subtle intimacy of hush chords which drove ballads like &quot;Crash Into Me&quot; and &quot;Lover Lay Down&quot; and provided the framework for upbeat harmonies on &quot;Lie In Our Graves&quot; and &quot;Jimi Thing.&quot;<br />The distracting Middle Eastern influence and vocal distortion of &quot;What You Are&quot; is reminiscent of Ballard's mediocre work on Morrisette's Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, while the airy, sonic landscape of &quot;Sleep To Dream Her&quot; falters in the shadow of &quot;Satellite.&quot; On other songs (&quot;So Right,&quot; and the first single &quot;I Did It&quot;), the band's sacrifice of free-flowing vibes for Ballard's tight, limiting production proves worthwhile, resulting in an admittedly fresh, professional sound unrealized on the group's past three efforts with long-time producer Steve Lillywhite (who they abandoned during early recording sessions last summer). <br />Everyday is different. But that doesn't make it inherently bad. Unfortunately, many of the band's querulous fans aren't as open-minded and will readily denounce that dogma, as their insatiable appetites for genetic clones of &quot;Ants Marching&quot; grow ever hungrier. Oh, the gluttony.
B00003CX8J|4.0|I was amazed at how great the Movie was.  As and X-Men fan I was really impressed by the characters and the action that was involved in this movie.  Finally someone translated a comic to the big screen that did not suck.  From Hugh Jackman being a very believeable Wolverine, to Patrick Stewart being the perfect Professor X.  This movie was cast amazingly and the plot was easy to follow for those who have never read the comics.  But those who have will pick up the minor references to the many characters in the X-Men mythos.  I hope this movie gets everyone out there to go pick up the comic books and continue to thrill in their adventures.<br />My only knock against this DVD is that it is not the final one.  After I purchased this DVD I read that the director Bryan Singer was planning on doing a second DVD with even more behind the scenes feature.  So they released one DVD to get their sales done and now a second to make you buy it again.  This is the wrong move to do making people buy a second DVD to have the full movie effect.  But if you can wait until the second DVD comes out get that one, if you can't and still want to see a great movie with some really cool features on DVD get it.  This movie does rate five stars but lost points when I heard a second DVD was coming out.<br />As an added bonus on the DVD see if you can find the hidden scene with Spider-Man.  Hint:  It is on the Theatrical trailer page.
6300182576|5.0|In this film Clint Eastwood has a name, for once. But he does not have a side. He is neither with the Mexicans whose lands are encroached upon by mining, railroad and farming companies, nor on the side of those same companies, nor on the side of the local sheriff and other people who live from and on those companies. He seems to demonstrate a lesson that the killers of the companies must be eliminated (justice cannot come from capitalistic gangs), that the guerilla warfare of the Mexicans must be stopped (justice cannot come from burning deeds and destroying simple people on the other side or having simple people on their side destroyed), and that the local authorities, including the judge and the sheriff must be taught how to impose justice against such disruptive forces. That seems to show that in that West there was no justice, because there never was any Joe Kidd to impose the respect of such rules and laws, so that the killers manipulated judges and sheriffs by putting themselves over the law, by being outlaws, so that the local American people got into posses and vigilanting groups, so that the local Mexicans, or populations, organized themselves and built up some ever-doomed resistance. Then a question is coming up from this film : How can justice triumph in such a situation ? And another question comes up : How has such an unlawful history imprinted its mark on present day reality ?  What is the result in present day multiculturalism of such a false and biassed method to impose a one-way solution through plain bloody fighting, be it outlawed murders or righteous suicides ? Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universities II and IX.

B000056VIY|4.0|This album is absolutely fantastic!! Jennifer's sassy vocals and the slick tracks make this album worth owning. There are a few disappointing songs, for example - 'secretly' + 'come over' are both..well pathetic!! She should definitely stick to the more upbeat songs. However, this is an excellent follow up to On the 6!
6304119046|5.0|I watched this movie with my mother to really find out where Charles Kane went wrong. We both had seen the movie many times. We would stop our VCR and discuss when and how Kane went wrong. And we both agreed. Kane was yanked away from his mother before he could be really loved. He then sought love from people through money. Not having really been loved, he could not give it. &quot;Rosebud&quot; represented  the last thing that he held onto from his childhood. Both my mother and I were astonished to see how this pattern was repeated over and over again. Especially from Jed Leland and Susan Alexander's accounts. This is a  &quot;must see&quot; film. But I believe that one must watch it attentively in order to understand the real meaning behind the film. One of the newspaper men at the end is Alan Ladd, star of the movie &quot;Shane&quot;. He has a very short part and is hardly visible. Good luck and good watching.
0380713802|3.0|If you want to read a captivating Bryson Title go for the Australian title, &quot;In a Sunburned Country&quot;.

The other books haven't met the mark for me. READ &quot;In a Sunburned Country&quot; there is plenty of history and incredible accounts of what he sees and does in that book that are a lot of fun to read.

B00005A1PR|5.0|I will rush to the store on March 27 to pick up this album. The songs from India Arie that appear on the Original Motion Soundtrack Bamboozled are increadible! They include &quot;In My head&quot; and the snippets &quot;God in You&quot;, &quot;Back to the Middle&quot;, &quot;Strength, Courage &amp; Wisdom&quot;, &quot;Can I Walk With You&quot;, and &quot;Promise&quot;.

0821221841|5.0|I thought that this book was very thorough.  I learned many useful things, and I also learned many things that don't really apply to me but I found interesting none-the-less.  Ansel Adams writes very precisely, and the book is packed with lots of very useful figures/photographs that help in understanding the text that is being read.<br />The book might be a little boring for a casual picture taker.  Also, I imagine that the book might be too basic for a professional who has been doing photography for a great number of years.  But for a serious photographer getting started, it is an excellent book.  And who better to read than the master Ansel Adams.
B00004ZAV3|2.0|I suppose it's a fairly futile exercise even to bother writing a review of a CD consisting of the Beatles' &quot;No. 1 Hits&quot;.  You're either soiling yourself over the sheer joy of hearing the same stinking songs for the four hundred billionth time or ... you're sort of yawning and wretching at the same time.  You might gather that I fall into the latter category.  I received this CD as a gift and, sure, it's fun to hear SOME of these songs AGAIN.  But R E A L L Y, and honestly, I'll bet dollars to donuts that even the most diehard reviewers in this space skipped through at LEAST 3 or 4 songs on their very first listen to this mind-numbing collection.  Mind you, when rock &amp; roll was young, most of these songs were not mind-numbing bilge (excepting Yellow Submarine of course).  However, with the passage of over 3.5 decades (35 years), a lot of this cloying material is just plain irritating.  I suppose this is the perfect CD to place into a changer and hit the random button (so the occassional Beatles song is played among other songs) - perhaps at a party with some of your not so close friends.  The changer, of course, would need to accomodate at least 299 other CD's to make tolerable this sycophantic paean to the generation of goofballs and lemmings who made this dreck collection &quot;NO. 1.&quot;  I suppose there is no underestimating the bottomless gullabilility of American consumers - to be duped into buying a music product they've probably heard at least 500 various times and which most of them already own.  But hey, it's the &quot;BEATLES!&quot; and its NOSTALGIC (ugh, gimme a break - at least the Stones still ROCK).
6305807086|5.0|Well, this is a comedy, right??? Then why aren't I laughing that much??? Must be a drama, right??? Then why aren't I whimpering and sobbing??? Anyone care to answer these questions??? NO... all right then, I will. Simple: BEING JOHN MALKOVICH defies every genre ever created. If anything it's an art film. The story, concerning a struggling puppeteer who stumbles upon a tunnel into John Malkovich's head, is easily the strangest idea ever to be committed to paper and the direction is so off-the-wall you'll find yourself rubbing your eyes in disbelief every five minutes or so. But that's a good thing. If BEING JOHN MALKOVICH proves anything to it's audience it's this: CREATIVITY IS NOT DEAD IN HOLLYWOOD... it's just been waiting for director Spike Jonze and writer Charlie Kaufman to come and snatch it up. And what a film they have made! Heartbreaking but humorous, wildly inventive yet strikingly simple... no other film can simply make you accept that a building has a 7 1/2 floor let alone make you really want to spend 15 minutes in the head of John Malkovich. It's all so amazingly creative and fluid that watching it is like witnessing a dream, something you're constantly surprised by yet extremel;y at ease with. Superb performances by John Cusack, Cameron Diaz (yes that really IS Cameron Diaz under all that hair), Catherine Keener, and even John Malkovich in a completely off-beat comedy-drama-arty contraption of a film. As film critic Glenn Kenny said, &quot;this is the Citizen Kane of consciousness-invasion movies&quot;. I'll call it &quot;astounding&quot;. Either way, it's really, really good.

I strongly recommend it for anyone who loves language as much as I do.<br />For anyone who writes, in any capacity, PLEASE read this book before sending out a single manuscript, and preferably, before even typing a single word.  Your editors or employers, and definitely your readers, will thank you.<br />As for me, I still haven't consigned this book to the shelf.  I prefer to keep it on my bedside table, a pocket-sized talisman to keep me safe and sound in a world of lousy writing.
B00003CXGP|5.0|You don't need to read Bret Easton Ellis's highly controversal novel to get the full impact of AMERICAN PSYCHO... you simply have to remember the eighties. An era of all style, no substance, and a perfect setting for this searing indictment against male vanity and territoriality. Christain Bale gives a rare performance as Patrick Bateman, a business suit-clad serial killer whose charming smile and uncanny fashion sense just barely hides a seething hatred for women and disturbing psychotic impulses. This is a performance of true power and wit and Bale throws himself into the role without a hint of self-preservation, a rare quality for an actor. The men portrayed in this film are as empty as their lives, their existence marked only by their haircuts and designer suits. The Bateman character could easily be anyone in the film, they are all the same person, the only difference between them is where they hang out, who they have dinner with, the ease with which they get reservations. The character of Bateman is reduced to spouting off philosophies behind POP SONGS of all things in order to show that he has a single original thought in his head (and the sight of an empty, meaningless character reaching for meaning in something as empty and meaningless as a Whitney Houston song is extremely funny). When Bateman and company are sitting around a meeting table swapping business cards, the scene takes on a perverse meaning, as if they were swapping the size of their members. It all adds up to an extremely funny film for those who appreciate this type of satire. However, the film has a very dark side to it as well. The graphic nature of the violence in the novel has been toned down or removed, but it is shocking nonetheless as Bateman splits open the head of one of his rivals (off-screen, mind you) and then casually sits down and lights a cigar. The callousness and seeming inhumanity of Bateman is frightening. Director Mary Harron creates a beautiful film given it's subject matter and it looks like it cost millions more then it did to make. Add great supporting work by Willem Dafoe, Jared Leto, Samantha Mathis, and Chloe Sevigny (who shares the most memorable scene with Bale, a date in which they completely mis-read each other's motives) and you have a film that's as entertaining as it is thought-provoking. It will stay with you for days. And that's a good thing.

B00003CXAR|5.0|Steven Spielberg's ultimate shocker still holds up great after all these years for the exact same reasons it was a huge box-office hit back in 1975: amazing score, powerful performances from an extremely talented cast, great special effects, and perfect direction. It's simple story of a shark terrorizing the waters of a small beach may not be the most compelling material ever to come out of Hollywood, but the attention to character and the sheer terror of the shark attacks more then makes up for it. There is something undeniably terrifying about the thought of being dragged underwater by something huge, something you can't even hope to escape from, and the very first attack scene is true nightmare fuel. As is the most memorable scene in the film, Robert Shaw's speech about his experiences after surviving the sinking of the USS Indianapolis, a World War II cruiser that sank and left hundreds of sailors floating in shark-infested waters for more than four days. Shaw's delivery of the scene still chills to the bone and stands as one of the greatest moments in film history. The DVD edition of JAWS has been long-awaited and fails to live up to it's potential. The lack of audio commentary by the director and a handful of out-of-context deleted scenes are major let-downs. But a superb 'making-of' documentary and an extensive art and design gallery are nice additions. Still, this is the definitive version of a classic film, one that deserves to be viewed multiple times both on the screen and in your darkest nightmares. Have fun swimming in the ocean after this one!!!
B00000IFP6|5.0|This is a truly incredible set of Beethoven's complete nine symphonies. The ever-guiding presence of David Zinman in the Zurich Tonhalle Orchestra, in addition to the use of the latest Beethoven cycle, enable new life to be breathed into these much-recorded works. Zinman adopts Beethoven's dangreously fast metronome markings, but he possesses, like Gardiner, that rare gift to make them sound natural rather than like Grand-Prix-styled Beethoven. The orchestra gives crisp, heart-hitting, alert and imaginative readings of all nine works, and the recording is truly amazing. Also, the Ninth has a good, if not ideal, quartet of soloists in the finale, but that shortcoming, along with a not-so-acceptable and weak timpani, is not enough for me to bash this cycle. In short, I would always say that this is perfect for beginners and should be considered a clear first choice for those who want a modern-instrument cycle. Especially at its tempting price that can give you hours and hours of enjoyment.
B00000ILDE|5.0|James Cameron has never been my cup of tea. Sure, he's flashy and no one has a better grasp of special effects and how they add to a picture. But can this master of eye-candy surpass Ridley Scott?  Absolutley. Different then the original, Cameron's film relies more on action then suspense, creating a film that doesn't shock so much as jolt the viewer. Edited at a break-neck speed and featuring spectacular (and i mean SPECTACULAR) special effects, ALIENS manages to blend the science-fiction film with the traditional shoot-em-up with such ease and skill that the pace never drags a bit... and the audience never gets a chance to breath. Sigourney Weaver reprises her role as Ripley, the sole survivor of the doomed Nostromo, playing her tough and stern, commanding and haunted, a deadly force to be reckoned with when provoked. Her impressive performance gained her an Oscar nod. The rest of the cast sparkles as well with Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, Al Matthews, and Jenette Goldstein as members of the gung-ho and tough-as-nails marine corps sent to investiagte the disappearence of an entire colony on the distant planet LV-426. But the film, in my opinion, belongs to Lance Henriksen in the role of Bishop, the soft-spoken android. And to Cameron, whose mastery of scene and spectacle help ALIENS acheive a kind of perfection in it's own right.
0446677450|4.0|This is a great beginners book, it provides the groundwork, but it doesn't go deep enough.  It would have been helpful if the authors, one of whom had an accounting background, provided some pointers for folks who need the basic how-to's of financial planning and management.
630414542X|3.0|Granted, the storyline is a little hokey, and the camerawork could have been better, but what most people refuse to remember is that this movie was made in 1986! Nobody ever accused movies from 86 of being the best there were. The storyline definitely is good and for any Highlander fan they'd find nothing better than this version of Highlander to watch. The added scenes make the story flow a little better, and short of getting the LD or DVD for the full directors commentary, it's the only place where you'd get to find out the story behind most of the scenes.
6305718954|5.0|The essential message of this excellently acted and assembled movie masterpiece is proven to be accurate by the very critics who dismissed and scorned it;  that is to say that any real Spiritual Truth will inevitably soar far above the heads of those who think they possess knowledge of truth through that smug, hypocrital, egomaniacally self-indulgent materialistic delusion they like to call intellect.  It doesn't take a genius to reach the conclusion that two thousand years without any Spiritual advancement is more than enough proof that something fundamental is amiss.  This movie and any with a similar message are a critical wake-up call to us all.
B00004T9UF|4.0|This is a brilliant album. Im not a big rap fan, but the tunes on this are great.  Kim may seem a bit extreme at the end, but up to that its not much different from how some relationships end. Marshall Mathers tells how his life has been, Kill You makes up with it was. Under The Influence and Criminal are also great songs. This album tells it how it was. There are some tracks where he just messes around, like Public Service Announcement, Paul(skit), Steve Berman and Ken Kaniff(skit)(i admit this is just sick, even though i hate the Insane Clown Posse).<br />This is a great album for Eminem fans, Rap fans, and anyone who likes a catchy tune. As for people who say it shouldn't be sold to under-18's, who hasn't already heard the words in this album.<br />Some songs on this album you have to listen to a few times before you start to like them, and if you listen to the whole album, it can get a bit boring after a while, which is why i gave it 4, but generally, this is brilliant.
0399146253|4.0|Finishing one of Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta novels is never a cathartic experience and this last book certainly holds true to form.  &quot;The Last Precinct&quot; is unusual because it picks up within 24 hours of where the previous Scarpetta novel, &quot;Black Notice,&quot; left off (usually much more time has passed with things happening like people getting blown up by bombs or something equally significant).  Scarpetta is still reeling from the attempt by Jean-Baptiste Chandonne, a.k.a. Le Loup-Garou or The Werewolf.&quot;  It is insufficient to say that you if you have not read &quot;Black Notice&quot; you will have trouble following the events in this novel, because &quot;The Last Precinct&quot; does some major revisionist history on virtually every major person and event in Scarpetta's life, particularly Benton.  The main narrative thread in this novel is that, in a grotesque turn of events, Scarpetta is implicated in the brutal murder of Diane Bray, Chandonne's previous victim and one of Scarpetta's many nemises.  It seems Scarpetta is not going to get away from being victimized from this most recent deranged killer to cross her path.<br />As always, the forensic details in Crowmell's novels are fascinating.  Most crime fiction glosses over such things and even in Scarpetta's world rather obvious scientific facts have to be hammered home to the idiots in power over and over again.  But these novels are always much more are Scarpetta's relationships with the people around here than the demented killers she is helping to track down.  I always look forward to finding out what is up with Lucy in each novel: having given up on the FBI and now ATF, Lucy is ready to enter the private sector (it seems she's been doing some interesting things in her spare time).  The novel's title refers to a newly formed investigative unit run by Lucy's old ATF boss, Teun McGovern.  But the name takes on darken significance as more of this immense and convoluted plot are revealed.  Like Scarpetta, we are asked to reconsider some of the major events in these novels in light of new and most revealing information.<br />In &quot;The Last Precinct&quot; the pivotal characters are a pair of women the professional equals of Scarpetta and the best parts of the book are her interactions with them.  The first is a familiar face, Dr. Anna Zenner, who becomes Scarpetta's de facto counselor, a move that could end up hurting our heroine as much as it helps.  The second is Jaime Berger, a first-rate prosecutor from New York who will apparently be handling much more than the Chandonne case, which is being moved to NYC for the worst of political reasons.  This also a shadowy behind the scenes figure who has a big impact: Pete Marino's estranged son Rocky, a New York lawyer with mob connections who will be defending Chandonne, just to make things really interesting.<br />When you finish reading &quot;The Last Precinct&quot; you will certainly not feel a sense of cleansing relief.  It is not because of the violent deaths and the detailed autopsies, but rather because with Cornwell it is never really over.  At best Scarpetta has a chance to catch her breath before the next round of horrors for which she is the inevitable focal point begins again.  Maybe this is just the middle part of an epic trilogy that will finally get us to the point where we can believe justice has been served, but I really have to doubt it given every other book in the series.aled.

B000002UAR|5.0|If the Beatles only recorded Rubber Soul, Revolver and Sgt Pepper they would have earned their status as the best in Rock.  In case you weren't around, these 3 albums were rock's watershed. Before Rubber Soul, we called pop music 'rock and roll'(small &quot;r's&quot;).  After Sgt Pepper we called it ROCK. Revolver is the core of this transition path.  Growing out of the sharpness of Rubber Soul, the Beatles branched beyond innovation.  Eleanor Rigby and For No One were the first true Rock &quot;ballads&quot;... Paul's voice perfectly fit to the musical arrangement.  Who can forget the starkness of Rigby the first time they heard it? John's musical experimentation in She Said and the dreamy image laden Tomorrow Never Knows, (probably the first true 'psychedelic' song), were in a class by themselves in 1966.  Here There and Everywhere is a melody that will live on forever in a host of musical genres.  George Harrison's Tax Man is a lyrical gem...wow.. was it really George who composed those lyrics? There is so much more happening on this disc besides lyrics and melodies though.  It is a total work, the best of its time and it laid a foundation for the future of music. VH-1 named it the best... but I would say it should be seen as part of a continuum - a link in a triad of Rubber Soul - Revolver - Sgt Pepper. (After hearing Revolver, no one should have been to surprised by Sgt Pepper.)
B000002UAR|5.0|What else can I say? One critic said it perfectly, &quot;If rock and pop were gone tomorrow this would be the album to rebuild. I ask myself why can't other rock groups look at this as a model. It's because rock bands like Blink so-and-so, and Dave mathews, and Limp bizkit do not have the musical talent that Lennon and Mccartney did. The two never got hung up on themselves. They moved ahead with everything they did and never looked back. Revolver should not only be an inspiration to musicians but all artist--Filmmakers, Writers, Painters, etc. This album is a wonderful trip though the imagination where we can explore the possibilities we once lost when we became cynical adults. If I were a doctor I would recommend my patients listen to this album at least once a month. Trust me on this. It has something for everyone.
068483605X|5.0|Watership Down is a stupendously marvelous book about rabbits. It starts out when a young                         rabbit named Fiver, a rabbit with the gift of foresight, sees the warren they live in being                         destroyed, and they must leave there at once, with as many as will follow. He convinces his                         brother Hazel, simply because Hazel knows the truth of his dreams. They approach the Thearah,                         the head of the rabbits, but that does not go well. So they leave the warren, and the story is of                         them traveling, trying to find a home, and at last succeeding. Then they have to get does from                         another warren, Efrafa, that is run very militarily by a rabbit named General Woundwort.<br />                        That is a lot more to this novel than that extremely brief summary. You get to meet a grand sea                         gull named Kehaar. It is one of my most favoured books, and I know of none outside the                         fantasy market that touches its realm of invention.<br />                        The best thing about this novel is how thoroughly researched this is. This is not regular                         anthropomorphic fiction, where talking animals are just caricatures of humans, or they're animals                         without that true sense of their nature. The rabbits in WATERSHIP DOWN behave like real                         rabbits. I'd go so far as to call this THE LORD OF THE RINGS of this type of fiction, with                         talking animals. Adams has taken the real behaviour of rabbits and set them in a wonderful story.                         The depth of his achievement never fails to amaze me. He totally makes a believable real world                         of the rabbits, and from the rabbit's perspective. Besides being a great novel, this makes this                         work stand out even moreso. All the places, including the place Watership Down, are real                         locations in England. <br />                        Although Brian Jacques' REDWALL series is often hailed in comparision to this, in terms of                         actual scope of reality, REDWALL and all its incarnations is inferiour to his. Not that I don't like                         REDWALL. Brian Jacques has a very real gift of telling a rollicking good yarn, and his series                         deserves everything it gets. Its just that WATERSHIP DOWN is better in the sense that instead                         of taking animals and imposing them with personalities, with them losing their nature and taking                         on a definably human one, Adams did not go to that extreme. He balanced them with ultimately                         human traits necessary for the story, but still in keeping with their animal nature, with them                         behaving and acting like real rabbits. This is why I love this particular novel so much. It achieves                         a balance of animal and human qualities, of which so few stories in this particular genre attempt                         to achieve. Of course, not all these stories are trying to achieve that balance, or need too,                         because they are aiming for an entirely different point and are using anthropomorphic fiction as                         its vehicle, and that's alright. (Case in point: George Orwell's ANIMAL FARM, which is as                         every bit as good as this, although it is sofor entirely different reasons.) It gives anthropomorphic                         fiction a new height and goal to shoot too:<br />                        1. To take an animal, for purpose of a story, and with human traits and failings let us get to know                         the character and its surroundings.<br />                        2. To take the character created, and to keep it in keeping with its real species. If it's a bear or                         an otter, have the bear and otter behave like real bears and otters. It makes the fiction so very                         much richer.<br />                        The interaction between the rabbits and human society is an excellent treatise in its own right on                         man's dominance over nature. It gives a very interesting view on how animals interact and deal                         with us. They are two separate societies, and each must deal with the other. Of course, the                         humans have the overall hand. That is why, indeed, the rabbits led by Hazel and Fiver must                         forsake their home warren in the first place. On the Notice Board (name of the first chapter &quot;The                         Notice Board&quot;) there is a notice which reveals the humans will make a shopping mall or                         something like that in that location. Although this may seem strange, the only other books that I                         have read that gives a very interesting animal perspective on human society is in quite a different                         setting, with largely comic overtones. The HANK THE COWDOG books, a children's series                         greeted with enthusiastic response from both children and adults, gives a perfectly delightful view                         of human society from an animal's perspective. They are written by John R. Erickson (I'm proud                         to say I hail from his home state of Oklahoma, though now I am far removed from there).<br />                        In conclusion, one of the books I love and respect the most. His depth of invention is amazing,                         his achievement, although in a much different setting, parallels the achievements of Robert Jordan                         and J. R. R. Tolkien. This is one of those books I wished I had written (as H. G. Wells said of                         Sinclair Lewis' BABBITT, and, perhaps more importantly, Stephen King said of William                         Golding's LORD OF THE FLIES, another debut novel). I bought a hardback copy of                         SHARDIK, a novel of similar magnitude (or so they say.) I haven't read it yet. They say it                         topples this book, and if that is the case, Mr. Adams is even moreso a truly remarkable writer of                         novels.

0553213105|5.0|For the typical male, the only thing worse than reading a romance novel is reading a two-hundred-year-old romance novel. So why'd I bother? Because I'm a firm believer that serious readers should occasionally expand their horizons and sample books from other genres, especially those they'd normally pooh-pooh. Because that's when we get pleasantly surprised.<br />Pride and Prejudice fell into this category for me. I wanted a break from the mystery/suspense genre and had heard good things about Jane Austen. As I dug in, my expectations were met early on: plodding, expository chunks of Old English describing landscapes and feelings. Ugh. But then she got me.<br />Like peeling an onion, Austen uncovers characters and a story that are simply genius. Like Shakespeare, she proves again that time and technology have no impact on basic human impulses and the complexities of love. This book will be just as popular in another two hundred years. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead.
B000001FFJ|5.0|Okay, it has to be said that this is probably my favorite Tom Waits album.  There is just too much here.  You know it's gotta be good when I can't decide on my favorite track.  Chances are, If you're reading this, you're either already a Waits fan or someone who's just discovered him (hopefully through a little indie-film called &quot;Down By Law&quot;, as I did).  Seriously folks this is one of the great ones.  This may not be tailor-made for the &quot;top 40&quot; crowd, but those with a heavy interest in off-beat lyrics will love him.  Oh yeah,  this one only gets better with age.....and bourbon.

B00003CX8J|2.0|the production of this movie doesn't suck. <br />but as an x-men fan i would have to say that it wasn't that good for x-men. the character concentration is mainly around wolverine, not that its bad, but for a 1.5hr movie , there is absolutely no time for the other characters to really have a chance.<br />I thought the choice of ian mckellan for magneto was a poor choice and it might have been affected by the fact that ian mckellen worked with the director, bryan singer, in a previous movie, &quot;Apt Pupil&quot; <br />Not that bryan singer is a bad director, he did usual suspects, and that was great, but that does not mean he is qualified to do an action/adventure/sci-fi , i.e. x-men.<br />overall i enjoyed viewing it once, and saw it a second to see the effects, but after that i felt that there was no deeper understanding of the x-men and why/how they came about, the political and public views with the mutants, and why there is a relationship between xavier and magneto, which should have been explored deeper in their past history, not the present.<br />afterwards the movie just seems to lack in any depth and does not provide for a want to view it over and over like a favorite movie. <br />the soundtrack , as many have noticed is batmanish. which is the poor effect hollywood has on movie making these days.<br />overall the best scenes were magneto's early scene when he was young and the scenes where wolverine fights sabertooth.<br />all the other scenes are short and cut and very dry.<br />x-men deserved to be a 2-3hr movie on the level that the  Superman I film was. and x-men fell far short in comparison to Batman I and Superman I. Watch those movies and you feel something, watch x-men and you may get bored.
B0000041DZ|3.0|Brendel plays the Beethoven sonatas with a great deal of care and gives thoughtful performances across the board.  Everything sounds meticulously planned, down to the last trill.  Brendel's technique is occasionally pushed to the limit but generally holds up quite well.<br />The real problem is that these begin to sound like cookie-cutter interpretations after a while.  For more engaging performances, try Sviatoslav Richter (especially the &quot;Richter in Leipzig&quot; CD) or Artur Schnabel.  In terms of more recent recordings, Maurizio Pollini takes a relatively straight interpretive approach but does a better job of bringing the music to life than Brendel does here.
B00004T9UF|4.0|... face it his cds great except for a couple of songs. every single skit is horrible and kim is perhaps the biggesy mistake on a song marshall has ever made. half of the words don't rhyme and the point of the song horrifies me. now to the upsides of the cd. the hilarious under the influence, classic westcoast b*** please 2, and stan which has some of the best lyricism i have ever heard are all standout tracks. another upside: how mathers approaches political and social problems. on the way i am he rebels against the whole community but still has a hit song. the beats are all great most having that my name is feel to them but others like the killer bass on stan are sure to have heads noddin. if u want to hear some great talent and don't analyze lyrics toomuch pick this up. peace out.'s a commercial success  but not a sellout. Whatever paranoia haunts his music haunts his life. This  CD is a must-buy more for hard-core rap fans than for the NSYNC crowd that  has made it so popular.....<br />People who like Eminem should check out other  'underground' MCs who rap pretty insanely. Kool Keith under all of his  alteregos one-ups Eminem in almost every department (including rapping  about being a serial killer.... strangely....) Ice-T is just as raw and his  Body Count stuff would appeal to the same audience (if they get that he's  being funny too....). Even old stuff-- Too $hort-- is lots in the same  vein.... I'd get this disc though... though the first one might be  better....hink that he has no  influence on kids and what they think. <br />I will agree with Eminem that  there are a bunch of stupid people out there who want to blame their bad  parenting skills on rap music and movies and television but on the same  hand entertainers need to realize the power they hold. Maybe his pile of  money has grown so mountainous that he cant see over it to see the damage  he is doing? argh.<br />I will admit that the album is crafted well, the beats  are on and the rhymes are clever. <br />I just dont dig what Eminem says. Its  a drag. <br />To hear Eminem's flippant 'f' you style was amusing. The charm  has worn off. Maybe the fans (or was that 'STAN'?) will wake up and realize  that the people who buy this album are the ones being made fun of.  hmmmm.<br />If you are going to buy it, theres nothing I can say to stop you.  <br />Just remember Vanilla Ice. Angry bleached headed white boy with ghetto  cred that made all the kids go crazy. Just think of Eminem as Vanill Ice,  the remix. zzzzzzz.<br />PS. I gave this album 1 star becuz amazon wont let  you give it zero stars. not because i endorse it.
0393314804|5.0|As i live in the area this great novel is based i hav a better insight to how real it is.  This novel held me from front to back,  unlike most people who have written reviews i had no problem with the language(but i realise how much of a problem it could be).  Trainspotting portrayed what my area WAS like perfectly, even the toilet scene.<br />One last thing to say, that novel is based in the 80's, my area has changed greatly since then.  If someone was to set it nowadays they would have a hard time making it seem realistic.<br />However overall the best novel i have read............yet
0671867369|5.0|A handful of reviewers have criticized this book claiming that Ambrose allows his personal closeness with the men of E Company, 506 Regiment, 101st  to cloud his judgement.  This account, B of B, follows E Company from training through the end at Berchtesgaden.  Does Ambrose make his subjects and their exploits larger than life?  Not to this reviewer.  These men and Ambrose's telling of their story is staggering simply because these were fighting men of extraordinary ability.  Nor do I have to take Ambrose's word for their skills as the Germans themselves have written of their concern when facing US paratroopers, particularly men of the 101st.  (Witness the significance of the 82nd and 101st during the Bulge as reported by the opposing Generals in &quot;The German Generals Talk&quot;, B.H. Hart.) Indeed some of these very men have told the story themselves.  Donald Burgett of A Company, 506th, has written 3 volumes and David Webster, also of E Company, has written his own &quot;Parachute Infantry&quot;.  Ambrose a cheerleader?  These men need none.  They were that good.<br />As for Ambrose's telling of their tale?  None better except perhaps Burgett's work on the 101st at Bastogne, \\"Seven Roads To Hell\\".
0425170349|1.0|Unfortunately I am one of those people who crave the release of a new Tom Clancy novel, however, being so few and far between, I have found myself passing time reading non-fiction books and research on specialized warfare.   It becomes painfully obvious within the first few chapters of this book that Tom didn't do his research.  He may have gotten a little information, but he most certainly made most of it up.<br />Being well versed, myself, in the tactics, weaponry, and explosives used by spec-warriors, his accounts lacked realism.  His depiction of British SAS standards, German GSG-9, and some US forces just weren't true to the levels that these individuals truly prepare for.<br />I must admit I tended to enjoy the tedious technicalities in Clancy's novels, but in this one, the technicalities are WRONG, and I found myself agitated when reading them.<br />If you enjoy quite a few action scenes with predicatble outcomes, this one's for you, but if you know anything about specwar, stay away from it.
4789007758|5.0|This is a great book as the Basic japanese grammar. it's well organized like an encyclopedia. having this book and the one before will cover most often used japanese grammars. one of the best grammar out there. very concise and useful for those who are serious about being fluent in japanese. no other book have i come across that is as easy to use and understand as this book. this book is like the bible of japanese grammar. Also get the Basic japanese grammar. it will give you a very strong foundation which is a must for those who love the japanese language.
0425098478|1.0|This book states was obviously writen by someone who never managed anything in entire life.  To sum up the entire book, he believes solely in hands a off management.  Unfortunately, this is not realistic and anyone who has managed a sales force understands their sales professionals' need for constant feedback, goals, etc.
4789004546|5.0|i've been studying japanese for some 8 yrs. this is the best book out there that i've seen on basic grammar. it helps you understand japanese much more faster then the explanations that you get out of your textbooks. if your serious about japanese, then you have to get a copy. often times you are taught grammar by grammar through memorization in class but with this you get an overall picture of the japanese language which makes it more easier to learn. A must have. i didn't understand much of japanese until i learned enough grammars to get a big picture of the japanese language. then everything fell in place. it gets easier to learn and understand.now only if there is a faster way to learn kanji other then writing them out over and over. the same goes with vocabularies.
B000002KIE|3.0|More words have probably been written about the Sex Pistols (and about this album in particular) than any other punk act from that era.  Thus, when I first started listening to punk, this was my launching pad.  Fortunately, I have moved on and have since found much better, better punk to listen to.  Is it a bad album? no, it has some genuinely catchy tunes (Holiday in the Sun, Anarchy in the U.K., God Save the Queen... you know).  But, is it a great album? In my opinion, no.  The Ramones wrote catchier tunes, the Clash had more substance, Talking Heads were more creative, the Damned were first(in the U.K., anyways).  Never Mind the Bollocks now stands mainly as a historical artifact... it got more media attention at the time, and continues to muster up attention now.  The Pistols were masterful media manipulators... but, let's face it, their musical skills and innovation was lacking (listen to the intro riff to this album... it was stolen straight off of the Jam's &quot;In the City&quot;).  Again, this album is not a bad album by any means... heck, I still listen to it from time to time.  But, I think it's place in punk's Partheon is highly exaggerated.  Listen to some other stuff from the same era... maybe you'll come to the same conclusion.
B00000GJ2B|1.0|This film is about the personal and professional life of boxer Jake La Motta, played by Robert de Niro. It starts off with La Motta as an overweight comedian just before going on stage, in 1964, and finishes with him going on stage. The story unfolds from there on, starting in 1941.<br />The troubled life of La Motta, from his relationships to his business deals, is shown in an unflinching manner. Martin Scorsese doesn't hold back. Every bit of violence is shown in the boxing ring and every bit outside it. Raging Bull is shot in classic black and white, reflecting the setting of the action. The close-ups, lighting, reminds me of great classical films but the depiction is all Scorsese. If it's Italian, got plenty of swearing, smart guys, pretty girls and violence it's bound to be Scorsese. Mind you, that's not a bad thing at all.<br />La Motta's impatience, paranoia and way of dealing with things, is clearly shown, ruining his relationship with his second wife and, eventually, his brother,, played by Joe Pesci. De Niro plays the role to perfection as you feel the impact of La Motta's emotions.<br />Raging Bull is one of my favourite films by Martin Scorsese because it's more realistic. It's the life of a real man, filled with mistakes and regrets. The viewer can relate in one way or another, but don't compare this to Rocky. Raging Bull packs small hands but heavy punches.
B00003CXP1|5.0|This film is terrific. The disintegration of Harry and Marion's relationship is harrowing, culminating in the saddest phone call I've ever seen on film. I was so pleased that this DVD will be released, like the screen release, without restrictive ratings cuts. The power of this film is undeniable, and should be shown to anyone thinking of becoming overly involved with drugs. But the real villian in this film is hope, the type of hope that people cling to aimlessly, afraid to let go. Not for the faint of heart, but a great film nonetheless, certainly undeserving of the snubbing that it received recently from the Academy Awards.0
B00000064G|1.0|Apparently, a lot of modern young musicians have looked to Nick Drake for inspiration. That sense of despair, that sense of loneliness, irrelevance, that kind of thing... Maybe that's one reason why they walk around like tramps, loud-mouthed and stupid. The search for individuality has surely drifted into the hands of ignorant swine.<br />By Pink Moon stage, Nick Drake had drifted into isolation and heavy depression. But the sound of Pink Moon is not crushingly depressing nor is it tediously claustrophobic.<br />The album has an overall quality of sound. Some bits are higher tempo and, so, more uplifting. The instrument playing is precise, like Drake's voice, carrying the listener over desolate hills and stillwater beaches. I can't really pick out the highlights because it's like taking the chicks away from the mother hen. <br />Pink Moon is worth more than a listen. It deserves to be thought of as a beautiful, melancholic, classic on anybody's list.
0060273224|5.0|I thought this was a kids book . But a friend suggested this book to me.  Sabriel is a witty , charming and totally enjoyable story of a young lady who happens to be a necromancer; She communicates with the dead.  She is on a quest to find out what happened to her father who seems to be lost in death . But along the way we encounter Nightmarish Monsters, adventure of all kinds.  I am not the best reviewer but all I can say is \\"If you like a great story filled with adventure , humor , some romance and that you Just don't want to put down  then do yourself a favor and read this book :) !
6302969352|1.0|The Seven Samurai is Akira Kurosawa's great masterpiece (remade into the western The Magnificent Seven). It's set four hundred years ago, in Japan, when bandits stormed the land stealing the possessions of peasants. The focus is on one particular village. In an attempt to save the village, from a horde of bandits, the peasants decide to hire the service of hungry samurai.<br />What's noticeable in The Seven Samurai is the way in which the peasants are portrayed. They are shown as having extreme emotions, being ragged and miserable. The nature of humanity is shown as peasants argue and steal amongst themselves. They are curious and gossip about everything they see.<br />When Toshiro Mifune first appears he captures the moment. Up to that point the action is frantic. His character is intense, excited at everything, even death, shown scratching himself with anxiety.<br />Kambei Shimada is the wise old samurai, Katsushiro Okamoto is the young samurai who becomes a follower of Kambei, Katayama Gorobei (strong man) is the jolly samurai, Shichiroji is a good friend of Kambei who looks for a challenge despite the lack of compensation, Heihachi is the clown, Kyuzo the masterful samurai, and Kikuchiyo who is animalistic, the essence of life. <br />I think an enjoyable film is a film that tells a story in such a way it draws you into its world. The story is magically told in The Seven Samurai. The camera observes every moment, movement and reaction without every becoming boring. In a way, it's an allegory about the nature of man. The attention is never just focused on Mifune's character, Kikuchiyo, as even the peasants are interesting to watch. Like reading a great book that's hard to put down, I felt sorry when The Seven Samurai finished. Truly, one of greatest films.
B000056K04|5.0|Being a hardcore Dave Matthews fan for years, the switching of producers from Lillywhite to Ballard disappointed me greatly. I didnt understand the logic behind departing from the producer that helped Dave with his unmistakable and irresistable sound. At first, this album is a little bit hard to digest. The sound is undeniably different, but the more I listened to it the more I realized that it's a musical progression, not a deviation. The same classic Dave sound is still there. If you didnt like the commercialized first single &quot;I Did It&quot;, don't worry. All the rest of the tracks on the album are extremely impressive (So Right, The Space Between, Angel and Fool to Think). Buy this album... you wont be let down ... and you'll be able to sing along to some great tracks during Summer Tour 2001!
6303073107|1.0|Akira Kurosawa loved rain. From the opening shot, rain is used to mask thought. There's no doubt about it. Rashomon is a very strange film. It feels 'different'.<br />Rashomon is the story of a man's death told from four different points of view. A man takes his wife through a forest when they encounter a bandit, Tajomaru, played by Toshiro Mifune, Kurosawa's favourite actor. The events which take place between that moment and the death of the man are unknown.<br />Four recollections are told from Tajomaru's point of view, the man's wife point of view, the man's spirit point of view, and, finally, from the peasant who is out collecting firewood and sees the incident. Every character tells his or her story to appear as if they've done nothing wrong. That's why it's difficult to believe any of them.<br />The direction of the film is beautiful. Every scene is perfect, like a fairy tale (one memorable scene is when the woman spins around in the dust and is possessed by her dead husband's spirit). Mifune's character, Tajomaru, is a rogue, full of mischief and animalism, basically what Mifune does best.<br />Rashomon's quality lies in its philosophies of mankind. We're already living in hell and there's no such thing as truth, laughs one of the peasants, though, if you're not put off by thoughtful films, Rashomon is quite heavenly to watch.
6305807086|1.0|What a load of old cobblers! This is like watching 6 short films strung together and not one of them has anything to do with another. There is no consistency here. It's just another reason why music video clip directors should not be allowed to make films.<br />Ask anyone why he or she liked this film and the standard answer is &quot;I thought it was interesting.&quot; 'Interesting' is how you describe bad haircuts when you don't want to offend.<br />Malkovich and Cusack should be ashamed of themselves... oh no, they already did Con Air. That was enough.

0446607274|5.0|Just finished it at work 2 minutes ago and had to come here and write a review.  (Good thing the boss wasn't around) Awesome!  The twists and turns!   Tough life Harry Bosch had - short marriage and seemingly approaching divorce, murdered friends.
B00000J7SS|5.0|This cd was one of my first Miles Davis experiences. I know most people start off with KIND OF BLUE and work from there but I was lucky to discover this and like it sans hearing the early classic stuff.This music is heavier than Krokus. I would honestly believe that anybody could feel some kind of heat from this album. There are notes that will make your spine shiver.It brings out the craziest of emotions. It definitely stands the test of time and is essential to any music lover.
0375707972|2.0|At first the book was good, but it grew tiresome.  I found myself skipping pages at a time.  You really didn't get to know the characters. I didn't connect with the main character at all.  His affair with the older woman was interesting at first, but it was no great love story.   If you're looking for a quick read, but no feelings this is for you.
0385335482|5.0|It has been a long time since I've read a book that has literally made me laugh out loud. This story just hit me in the right place at the right time ... it was a sheer pleasure to read. Becky can be pretty clueless, but I can relate to the moments of temporary insanity when it comes to shopping! This clever tale lightheartedly examines the correlation between looking good and feeling good ... as well as the journey to discovering true talent and purpose from within. (A little bit of faith, optimism and luck never hurts ... ) I will be recommending this book to everyone!
0792110188|4.0|This movie still remains one of my favorite westerns.  John Wayne, in fine form, plays his stock character, the Rattlesnake-quick hired gunfighter, but with one problem--A bullet in his back from an old injury causes paralysis in his gun hand at the most inopportune moments.  In the end, he is forced to resort to trickery to defeat the villian of the piece, another hired gunfighter played with icy calmness by Christopher George.  The Duke begins to show his age in this movie, but just like fine wine he only seems to improve as he gets older.  Also included is the unforgettable Robert Mitchum, as the sheriff on a full-fledged drunken bender.  The two actors complement each other quite well, although sometimes it seems they compete for the camera.  Also included in the cast is a very young (but still unmistakable) James Caan, the beautiful Charlene Holt as The Duke's long-suffering girlfriend, and Arthur Hunnicut as the noisy, loveable old coot who, along with Caan's character, provides some strong comic relief.  If you don't recognize either of those last two names, don't worry--I didn't either.  Note to parents:  While there is a lot of gunplay and fistfighting in this movie, remember, it was made back in the 60's--blood and gore are kept to a minimum.
0060922583|5.0|I am researching LSD and its essential outgivings of the human psyche and why we release such thoughts the way we do under the influence of the chemical.Through my previos experience I exploited many astonishing findings that involved stretching out the senses. The state of mind I've put my self in through my sessions is one of a high faithful optimistic researcher. In with the &quot;solution&quot; (otherwise known to all as LSD)I discovered that at times the visual you project out of your mind is coming directly from the expiramenter. The powers of the astonishing wave moments come through with this particular solution from strong imaginative emotions. As with the explicate order, here in this other realm we are taught that the powers of the mind are so potenent that they are capable of projecting and materializing anything and shutting out the principles of science and how matter works. Gravity is a formal pull, and as we are told of psychokenesis, we may be able to even move gravity out of our way and float away like a feather in space. To make this theory clearer we  must give ourselves the understanding that the energy field and particles making up gravity posses a certain kind of consciousness that we as human beings in our normal state of mind, cannot comprehend. Through inside the implicate with the solution we can somehow place ourselves in gravity's place putting ourselves vulnerable and capable of being gravity itself and literally possesing its traits. If an interconnection is installed through such an exercise the expectations should be classified as &quot;Limitless&quot; and &quot;Unpredictable&quot; leading to many phenomenal occurences such as an outer-body experience or a &quot;New emotion-finding&quot;. When under the influence of LSD we give out so many different emotions through us. I believe these hard built emotions are emotions we probably once had in another life or maybe an emotion we posses through our unconcious selves. When touched through by LSD our brain functions at the equivalence of our dream like state clinically proving us unconcious or sometimes by these raging critics, &quot;Insane&quot;. What's being projected out of our mind through the experience is whatever we profoundly percieve to be there or whatever we're thinking, and even what our &quot;Focal Point&quot; reminds us of. The focal point in an LSD session is simply where you're setting your stable sight on. For example,picture yourself looking at a sink and its faucet;depending on how strong you mind works and how strong your visual aids are will be the results of your &quot;Out total projected image&quot; that shocks you. It should not only be the image through your sight that is so shocking,but all those other senses should be shocked also. The shock should be composed either by a theory of that faucet's past, present, or future, or even how that faucet feels about everything.Many times I find myself not being able to project what an object feels about everything. So instead I simply find out how it physically feels. This itself &quot;For now&quot; is a brilliant data to my collection for my spirit and its skills. Skills are formatted by beliefs and faith. If you believe it can, then it will under the proper circumstances and under the right process taken.
B000002HJD|5.0|If you listen closely to the Doors double album &quot;Absolutely Live&quot; right before they launch into &quot;Whiskey Bar&quot;, you hear Morrison say &quot;All right...what do you guys want to hear next?&quot; All the teenyboppers scream out &quot;Light My Fire!&quot;. I swear you can hear Morrison sigh into the microphone, regretting the day that Robby Krieger penned their first radio hit. The man wanted to be a poet, not necessarily a leather-panted frontman. What I'm getting at is this is what Morrison wanted the people to hear. His poetry is wonderful, thought provoking, conversational, a little sophomoric at times,  and the backing of the Doors on such passages as &quot;Newborn Awakening&quot; and &quot;Ghost Song&quot; makes this a must-have album for Doors fans. This album really lets the remaining Doors shine. All of their playing is so different on the six Doors album, compared to &quot;American Prayer&quot; and their creative freedom really comes through here. The album also contains a smokin' live version of Roadhouse Blues, as well as snippets from other Doors albums (very cool double reading of &quot;Texas Radio and the Big Beat&quot; on &quot;Stoned Immaculate&quot; and &quot;Riders on the Storm&quot; on &quot;The Hitchhiker&quot;!) If you want more post-Jim music, the Doors &quot;Full Circle&quot; is interesting (though likely way out of print). Regardless, do yourself a favor: buy this and Morrison's book of poetry &quot;Lords and the New Creatures&quot; and you'll really experience what Morrison was trying to accomplish before he broke on through to the other side!

B000001IQH|5.0|Punk dead? Hell no! If you think for one instant that punk rock is dead, so is your brain. I bought this album several years ago, and it is still as fresh and vitriolic as it was then. Doesn't matter how many times you listen to it, the energy is still there. Nearly twenty tracks of raw street-punk attitude that reminds you there are still a few good bands left today!

6305075379|5.0|A cult classic this, personally it's an all time favourite but I know a lot of people who hate it.  A plot that is the stuff of westerns, Mad Max is set in the desolate near-future where the police are fighting a losing battle against psychopathic bikers who wreak havoc on anyone they feel like.  Even when arrested the law is virtually powerless to contain the thugs and they are generally released without charge.  Super-cop Max keeps his cool, even when his best friend is murdered, but when they see off his wife and child Max decides enough is enough, heads out in his super-charged V8 Interceptor (one of the coolest cars in cinema history), and embarks on a zero-tolerance one man campaign to wipe out the mad criminals.  It's this finale that is the films main asset - Max is mesmerising as he relentlessly mows down all the bikers without giving them any chance of redemption.  But the entire film is a real treat, with a weird atmosphere and some truly bizarre scenes, most of which involve the crazy bad guys, especially hilarious main baddie Toecutter.  Unfortunately though this terrible American print which I recently had the misfortune of seeing - or more appropriately, hearing - ruins the film.  The dubbing is truly awful, turning the whole cast into ham actors, altering parts of the script and even in occasional instances, bizarrely, omitting some of the sound effects.  Oddly, this print is also the one featured in the most recent UK video release. I must stress that the only way to fully appreciate Mad Max is to hunt down a copy featuring the original Australian soundtrack and, preferably, in Widescreen.
0790733226|5.0|As one of those people who could never bring myself to buy videos (thinking a person really only needed to see a movie once--and to buy it would be an extravagance)--this is one of only two movies I have ever bought.  I don't know if it would touch everyone the way it touched me, but it's one of those rare movies my science-fiction-loving husband and I BOTH love (and I don't normally have any use for science fiction).  Jodie Foster is perfect as the heroine--some phenomenal, moving acting. It's a unique story--and, for the second time, I sat and watched some of the scenes with tears in my eyes (I even have them writing this).
B00003652R|5.0|Not merely a milestone for Marillion but also one of the finest albums of the 80s. My appetite for sidelong concept suites is not especially huge, but listening to this is a breeze - it never fails to move me and put some swing into my otherwise-lethargic step. Instrumentally it is, of course, precise and developed, which is par for a prog band. The singles 'Kayleigh' and 'Lavender' come early and provide a sort of accessible entryway for the listener. Jaw-dropping moments abound, such as the odd-timed segue from 'Childhood's End?' into 'White Feather'. The production is lush and the lyrics are strange, charming and brilliant. I'd recommend this to anyone who craves music that engages both emotionally and intellectually.
B000002GQK|5.0|Like its better-known successor, &quot;Seventh Sojourn,&quot; this is not an concept album with one unifying theme, but just a fantastic group of songs that Tony Clarke, their producer, who was sometimes called the &quot;Sixth Moody,&quot; managed to string together in such a way that they fit together beautifully even though they are so different from each other.<br />The only song on this album that is not a masterpiece is &quot;Nice to Be Here,&quot; a corny little tune by Ray Thomas (who should record a children's album.) But it's still very listenable and for that reason it doesn't detract from the album. <br />The introductory track, &quot;Procession,&quot; is a highly experimental instrumental, written by all 5 band members, that features Graeme Edge playing with his new electric drum set and the rest of the band playing around with music from different periods of history (kind of like they did in &quot;House of 4 Doors&quot;, though very different). &quot;Procession&quot; segueways into the rocking hit &quot;Story in Your Eyes.&quot; Then we get the provocative &quot;Our Guessing Game,&quot; the unabashedly touching &quot;Emily's Song&quot; and another rocker, &quot;After We Came,&quot; in which all 4 Moody singers alternate on vocals. Then comes the album's cornerstone, the John Lodge epic &quot;One More Time to Live,&quot; one of the most powerful songs in the Moodies' catalogue. It rivertingly tells the story of the history of the human race, from creation to modern times, and is inseparably linked with &quot;Procession.&quot; After &quot;Nice to Be Here,&quot; we get &quot;You Can Never Come Home Again,&quot; a great ballad despite its redundancy, and the introspective and haunting &quot;My Song.&quot;<br />Like the rest of the &quot;Core-7&quot; (the Moodies' 1st 7 albums) this album is a shining jewel in any music collection. It does what Moodies music does best: it speaks to your soul.
B000021XS0|5.0|Imagine throwing equal portions of Genesis, Metallica, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and Weather Report in a pot, stirring, adding seasoning from various styles of American rock music (from sources as diverse as Foreigner and Limp Bizkit), and trying to cook a rock opera from this. (DT has been known to play covers of at least Zep and Floyd in live concerts.)    Sounds like a recipe for disaster? Think again, at least on condition that you have five excellent musicians doing it. Makes you wonder what &quot;Tommy&quot; or &quot;The Wall&quot; would have sounded like if the Who or Floyd were staffed by &quot;real&quot; musicians rather than amateurs with a gift for songwriting.    The lyrics are not the band's strongest point (although the music meshes well with the story line, the words are at times borderline doggerel), but the singer makes up for that in delivery and range. And there are so many extended instrumental sections on this album that this criticism hardly matters.     Inspired and inventive playing from all musicians. A manifest love for odd meters and time signature changes, which at the tempos these guys play would become pure mush were it not for their incredible sense of timing. They have a talent for making the oddest stylistic juxtapositions sound quite natural which I find irresistible.     My favorite tracks on the album are &quot;Home&quot;, the instrumental &quot;The Dance of Eternity&quot; (which at  times reveals a sense of humor on the part of the keyboardist), &quot;Fatal tragedy&quot;,  and &quot;Beyond this life&quot;. (Together these tracks are as long as most albums.) I care less for some of the soppier ballads, which are mercifully short. Some &quot;AOR rock&quot; type melodies which might have been a bit trite by themselves achieve a magnificent &quot;clair obscur&quot; effect when thrown in at the climax of an increasingly busy and tense instrumental section.    I'll take this over any Tim Rice product anytime :-) Seriously, anybody whois not a stylistic purist and who likes music with some technical meat on the bones should buy this album.
B000002GQJ|5.0|&quot;Question&quot; is in a way the ultimate Moody Blues song, because the Moodies' music is constantly probing and pondering the meaning of our existence by asking hard or impossible to answer questions about life.<br />But &quot;Question&quot; is just the tip of the ice burg. This album is bursting with beautiful songs, including the lovely &quot;And the Tide Rushes In,&quot; the foreboding &quot;Melancholy Man,&quot; the brilliant &quot;Dawning is the Day&quot; and the inspiring &quot;The Balance.&quot; There is one fairly cheesy song that doesn't live up to the rest: &quot;Tortoise and the Hare.&quot; But it is by no means bad, just not as good.<br />This was the last Moodies concept album. The unifying theme, the search for identity, isn't as prevalent as that of, say, &quot;To Our Children's Children's Children,&quot; but it's there. Rather then learning as they grew old the secrets of their soul, middle age more or less brought an end to the insatiable youthful curiosity that so loaded these classic albums. As good as much of their later music is, it doesn't have that same philosophical quality. For that reason, this album (and the other old school Moodies albums) should be savored as genuine treasures.
0451197968|5.0|I really loved this book, it's fast paced and smart, there's never a dull moment. Stephen King predicts the downfall of society, The story takes place in the ghetto of Co-Op City is 2025. Ben Richards is a 28 year old married man living in a crappy apartment with a wife who has to turn tricks to get food on the table and a daughter dying of the flu. In an effort to save the two people he cares for the most, Richards auditions to play in one of the twisted game shows the Network plays daily on the Free-Vee. He is accepted to play in the game show, The Running Man. The object of the game is to stay alive for thirty days, the catch is that the world is out to kill you. Desperation and paranoia rule, and there's not a soul on earth Richards can trust.
B0000026NC|3.0|A Pink Floyd live album was badly needed when &quot;Delicate sound of Thunder&quot; came out - and it could have been worse. The tracks off the awful &quot;Momentry Lapse of reason&quot; sound at least listenable here (apart from 'Dogs of war') - infact 'Sorrow' and 'On the turning Away' are great. It's a shame 'Signs of Life' isn't featured here - that was one of the few decent tracks on AMLOR. The Floyds old tracks sound either great or decent. 'Shine on..' sounds great here, as does 'Comfortably Numb' - and the guitar solo at the end of 'Another Brick in the wall' is awesome! The rest of the early stuff is pretty good - it would have been nice to here stuff like 'Echoes' or something off &quot;Animals&quot; though.<br />This records failing (apart from the weak AMLOR stuff) is the lack of concert atmosphere. Gilmour never speaks to the audience; there's no mistakes or amusing banter - no fun. For all we know all the stuff on this record could have been done in the studio. Considering how good this album could have been; it's very average - at best.
B000002B35|2.0|This is a competent rip off!! All the songs sound ok, but there's so many songs here that also feature on &quot;Delicate sound of Thunder&quot;!!!!!! Talk about a waste of cash. Musicians should no better than to insult there fans with efforts like this. At least when McCartney realeased &quot;Tripping the Live fantastic&quot; and &quot;Paul is Live&quot; within 4 years of each other - there was only 1 song that featured on both albums. With &quot;Pulse&quot; and &quot;Delicate Sound..&quot; there's LOADS!! (And they don't sound any better or worse either!) You'd think that 'Gilmour Floyd' would at least have the decency to include some earlier classics that WEREN'T on DSOT, but no! Infact NO thought and desire to create something that the fans actually want has gone into this one! I'm tempted to give it 1 star as a matter of principal - but the songs aren't bad enough for that. Do yourself a favour - avoid this.....
B000002MY3|4.0|This is one of the cornerstone albums of the 90s, it helps define the early part of the 90s commercial mainstream scene. Almost anyone and everyone who listened to Top 40 radio in '95 could not escape these stay-in-your-head songs. Which was the key to this album's blockbuster success. My favorite songs are &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;, &quot;You Learn,&quot; &quot;Ironic,&quot; &quot;Head Over Feet,&quot; &quot;Hand In My Pocket,&quot; and &quot;Mary Jane.&quot; Very reliable source of hits. Recommended.
B000002C1W|2.0|Oh dear! Ok so 'Signs of Life', 'Learning to Fly', 'On the turning Away' and 'Sorrow' are pretty good. That's only 4 songs though (and one of those is an instrumental)! <br />'A new Machine' (parts 1 and 2) is just filler; plain and simple. 'One slip' could have been better if the words weren't so rubbish ('a restless eye across a weary room' indeed!), 'Yet another movie' should have been called 'Yet another song' and don't even get me started on 'Dogs of War' - the worst Pink Floyd song EVER - by a long way! 'Terminal Frost' sounds good at times, but also sounds like it belongs on someone else's album!   <br />You'd do better buying &quot;Delicate sound of thunder&quot; than buying this - most of the tracks feature on that album too. Floyd after Waters have done 2 ok albums: &quot;Delicate sound of thunder&quot; and &quot;The division Bell&quot; - AMLOR is NOT one of them!
B000001Y79|5.0|No Doubt beared platinum fruit with this delectable collection of charttoppers and sparkling So Cal/ska-meets-punk-meets-pop. This is an incredible album which showcases the amazing versatility of each member of the group and highlights Gwen's incredibly expressive and confessional songwriting. This album just gets you jumping up and down, and happy. With sing-a-longable songs and irrepresibly irrestible rhythms, how could you go wrong? They stay in your head and they make you happy. Perfect music for listening to on the freeway an hour before dusk. Ascension-like. Very recommended.
B000002GQE|5.0|Start with this Moody Blues Classic (the first BIG album for them) and listen to ALL the rest, right through Seventh Sojourn (1972).  Listen to them in order, or any way you like, maybe get some headphones, whatever...just listen to them all and DO IT NOW!  The Moody's are think are STILL touring.  I believe they are the last of the Brit Invasion bands to still do so, outlasting the Stones &amp; Kinks...these guys never broke up and are mostly original, except for keyboard player Mike Pinder. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?
0375501851|1.0|Don't believe the hype<br />I'm still trying to work out why all the critics gushed over this novel.  All I can think is that they actually think this book is an honest, sincere glimpse into the life of Blacks and Asians in London.  I think that is what's so frustrating about this book.  Nothing rings true.  If this book does open a floodgate of imitators (which I'm quite sure it will) I hope someone else with a bit more talent can improve on this.  The worse thing would be that anyone got the impression that this is what London life is really like for us.  <br />I finished this book not caring about ANY of the characters, which is surely not a good sign.  Not Archie, not Samad, not Clara or Alsana, not Millat/Magid /the Chalfens and definitely not Irie - who I'm sure was supposed to hold this whole story together.  There's not one sympathetic character within the pages.  By the end of the book, you're left wondering why you wasted so much time (and it is a long book) reading about such a pathetic bunch of people.<br />Most of the critics seem to be in awe of what they consider as the author's confident, assured and mature style of writing (especially considering her young age, it's her first novel etc.).  However, I think the tone of this novel is one of pure indulgence and arrogance.  It appears that a thesaurus was used the whole way through the novel, (for every simple expression, the most elaborate word is substituted in its place, which meant the story was made unnecessarily laborious to follow.  <br />The author also used half facts, and down right untruths about certain things pivotal to the story (i.e. the Jehovah's Witnesses religion, multicultural London life) to blatantly patronise and mislead the reader.<br />I am not a Jehovah's Witness, but I know for a fact, that Clara would not have been sent to a Catholic school, none of their members would wear a cross, they don't quote from the King James version of the bible and they don't sing secular hymns andthey are not your stereotypical Pentecostal churchgoers, in fact a Witness wouldn't use the word church, the rank and file Witness does not have any influence on what is printed in their magazines (unlike Ryan Topps) and they would never - I repeat NEVER organise a protest for ANY reason. <br />These are all things that could have found out quite easily.  The fact that it wasn't shows contempt for the reader as far as I'm concerned.  The Witnesses are an easy target, but singling them out for what amounts to amateur attempt of humour is quite spineless.  I<br />'m not an expert on the Muslim religion, but certainly this story isn't exactly a good advertisement for it either (but then it WAS recommended by Salmun Rushdie - perhaps that should have been a clue).<br />There was no real thread running through the story - it starts off following Archie, then skips to Clara, leaves Clara halfway through her story, jumps to Samad then to their children - but instead of fleshing out their characters, they're just left as empty shells, while the past history of characters who don't really have a lot of bearing on the story are delved into in far too much detail.  Clara, who should have been a strong central character, seems to disappear from the whole story.  Irie, who is a central character, ends up becoming spoil and vindictive.  Samad and Alsana are just Asian caricatures, no depth, just the regular stereotypes.  No one seemed to have any redeeming features..<br />There were a few times where I thought the story showed a bit of humour - the black hairdressers, the false teeth - even Joyce Chalfen (although she also seems to disappear half way through the story) but nothing about this novel was new or fresh.  I hope no one read this thinking they were getting some sort of insight into how Black/Asian Londoners live - it doesn't even come close. <br />And what was that ending about?  None of the ends are tied up.  It all comes across as if the author is trying just that bit too hard to be clever.  Perhaps the author really does need to mature.<br />In my opinion, this book is a wasted opportunity to put the real story of multicultural London out there.
0452281881|5.0|There's nothing new in this book stylistically or in its content. Nevertheless, I found it to be very fumy, made more so by the way in which the conventions of e-mail messages tie the various characters together within the mailing group. For example, RE: `I'm gutting'. - This is the CEO from Helsinki, Pertti van Helden replying to London's CEO, David Crutton, with regard to the abrasive brush-off sent in response to his rejected advertising campaign. <br />I know it sounds a bit nerdy to cite such a technicality as an interesting and novel way to add dynamics to a story but the RE:s work really well to add context to the actions and reactions of the characters. <br />The occasional `Attachment' also works well as a way to spread the vitriol at the speed of e. <br />I thought e was similar to Nicholson Baker's `VOX' . VOX was two characters on a Chat Line. The principle is exactly the same but across a wider net of participants.<br />The spoof, millershanks,  web-site is worth having a look at, too.
B000002699|5.0|this recording is so far ahead of its time. here miles davis takes you on the journey of the hero, and that is in all of us. this is trance music expressed pretty much spontaneously. davis is unselish and inspires unselfish play on all of the musicians part. the guitar parts are SICK. the 2 (two!) keyboard players are out of their minds! miles davis without a doubt inspires wayne shorter in possibly the most beautiful sax solos ever.<br />so any fan of music that is basically a mirror of your life, pick this one up.
B000002UV1|5.0|I bought this album after buying californication and one hot min.  And then bought blood sugar.<br />This album goes from clean hardcore funk songs to sweet melodic songs and great spiritual songs too.  I think that all 4 chili albums i have r all exellent and impossible to compare with each other.  They all have a unique funk genre kind of and i cant compare them.<br />I think the best song on this album is Knock me down this is a powerful song being written  after slovaks death and this song is linked very closely to him. the rest of the songs r gr8  the only song i dont like on this album is &quot;nobody wierd like me&quot; not too bad , it's listenable! the intrumental pretty little ditty is what it is called litterally.<br />knock me down is one of my Favourate songs ever!
630575067X|4.0|Despite what you might have heard, there is a plot to this movie. Two Jedi Knights, Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi, discover a young boy with tremendous potential named Anakin Skywalker. Meanwhile, the mysterious Senator Palpatine has created a situation which he hopes will result in him becoming the Supreme Chancellor of the galaxy. That's somewhat brief, but it gets the point across.<br />The Phantom Menace is not the best Star Wars movie, then again it is not the worst. While not quite living up to A New Hope or The Empire Strikes Back, many feel that it does in fact surpass Return of the Jedi, the final film of the saga. It could be said that both TPM and ROTJ both suffer due to their locations in the overall plot. TPM is the very beginning, introducing characters that will grow as the story develops, and ROTJ is the resolution (not the climax of the Saga, that's ESB), tying up all the loose ends and completing the storyline. <br />The acting is the same as it was in the first films. Neeson is fine as the compassionate Jedi Master who values all life, and McGregor is the perfect choice for a young Kenobi. The rest are something of a mixed bag, at times perfect, yet at times somewhat lifeless. This could be partly due to some of the dialogue, but it would be unfair to completely lay the blame there. <br />The effects are some of the best ever seen. Many people still don't realize that a lot of what they are seeing is an &quot;effect&quot;. Many of the sets were extended and completed digitally, and there is a great variety of computer generated characters. Many complained about the abundance of &quot;effects&quot; in TPM, claiming that they distracted from the story. There is a scene in which Qui-Gon and company enter a dirty, dusty spaceport. In the background tiny little digital alien tourists walk along. This is not a distraction that harms the story, it is an effect that makes the setting seem more real. The worlds of The Phantom Menace are inhabited with creatures that lend a sense of life to the surroundings. <br />Many say &quot;Phantom Menace should have been this or that..&quot; What saddens me is that what these people wanted was, for the most part, a pretentious, heavy handed, dark and brooding film. I've read many &quot;suggestions&quot; as to how TPM &quot;should have&quot; been and basically, they wanted Anakin Skywalker to become Darth Vader immediately and do a bunch of evil stuff. It's not surprising that some were upset when they got a fun, kid-friendly (as Star Wars has ALWAYS been) adventure movie. And yes, the kids do like it. I couldn't help but smile when I saw a little girl (maybe 3 years old) looking at the Phantom Menace storybook with her mother, pointing at a picture of Anakin Skywalker in his podrace helmet. <br />Anyway, to sum it all up, it's a solid movie. Bring on the next two.
B00003CXE7|5.0|I think some people get too hung up on the little details. I felt the overall feel of ancient Rome was conveyed well, and the &quot;give me a break&quot; type things people complain about don't effect the quality of the story. Making a period film probably isn't easy, and little slip ups (though i don't think they should even be called that) are hard to avoid. Gladiator isn't supposed to be a special on the Discovery channel. It's a MOVIE. Just enjoy the acting, stroryline, and try to appreciate the great sets instead of obsessing over stupid little things.  Not to mention the musical score was well done, and the entire other DVD with the special features was a nice bonus.
6304493681|2.0|If you like anime, you will not like this. It's all about philosophy and lots of boring chitty-chat questioning life. The thing is, you can not relate yourself to the characters because their all cyborgs, and the world they live in is so dark and unrealistic. There are only two action scenes, but aren't very exciting and has exploding heads! When you reach the end you can't believe you paid the kind of money you did to get the film, expecting something groundbreaking, instead you get something reasonably scary, but absolute rubbish. The only reason why it got two, instead of one, is because the quality of the animation with the use of computer graphics is good.
0767802470|5.0|As far as comparisons go, forget U-571 (as 1 example)....it amounts to cheap, derivative Hollywood trash when held up against this true work of art from talented director Wolfgang Petersen.  From start to finish a true masterpiece.  Not only does this movie expertly convey the horror of war, but so much more besides that.  We see the folly of believing one is invincible in the cockiness of the first officer, the Captain's attempting to deal with what he perceives the &quot;wet-behind-the-ears&quot; nature of his crew, and somehow surviving, though just barely, in spite of this.  Not only that, by the time this movie is over, you KNOW the crew.  You feel their pain, their joy, their happiness, their fear, their just plain hoping they won't die hidden beneath their cocky, eager exteriors.  No character is a throw-away, all are developed extremely well, and help to pull you into the story.  The ending is also a superb statement, in that few movies since have duplicated it in terms of sheer bitter irony and pure truth, as opposed to some cliched &quot;ride off into the sunset&quot; piece, something commented on by a previous reviewer, that bears mentioning again.  Well worth your collection as a submarine movie afficianado or merely someone who appreciates GREAT movies.  Das Boot - the real deal
B000056JYC|5.0|that i waited so long to buy FCA, it's one of those albums that you take for granted, i was 10 years old in 1976, and like the rest of the world, i've heard the 3 hits off the original FCA many a time over the years, i have a couple of the tracks on the DAZED AND CONFUSED ST, anyway, the time was right for me to buy the 25th anny issue, and i'm so glad i did, it's just awesome, i love all the tracks, it's a great album, and if ever there was  an album than screams out SUMMER TIME it's frampton comes alive!!!!!!! buy this cd set now! and enjoy the hell out of it!!!!!!!
B00003CXFV|5.0|I hope that the Academy does not look at Erin Brokovich &amp; say its a comedy, we cannot award Julia Roberts the Oscars for a comedy. I really hope not cause Julia Roberts was brilliant in this movie. She did a great job irrespective of the fact its a comedy or not. Hats off Julia. The movie is great guys. Its a must see. The script, the acting.. everything in the movie is great
B000002HPV|5.0|I was in the middle of a painful divorce when I first heard this CD.   I was immediately struck by the thought, &quot;Wow, this is what my pain sounds like&quot;.   It was a very carthartic CD for me.  Bjork's words and music expressed feelings I had been struggling with and helped set me free.   Bjork's arrangments are soaring and her voice is one of the most expressive in modern music.   Buy this CD, I hope it enriches your life as much as it has mine.
B000002U82|5.0|Album of the year, 1973.     741 weeks on the charts.     30,000,000 copies sold. not counting pulse.(contains live version of entire album).                      out sells MJs thriller daily on amazon.com.               It did all this without music vidieos,love songs, or dance songs.                 This is very dramatic music,not suited for the weak of heart,or those with a short attention span.      Breath~a song about building your home and dreams,and never being satisfied.       on the run~audio example of  radical life styles ultimate end.                         Time~(best song ever written). the clock is ticking, the starting gun has gone off, get going with your life. This song changed the way i look at my life, how i use my TIME on this earth!                       Great gig in the sky~no, i am not afraid to die, anytime will do. I dont mind. pure emotion thats too good for words.                   Money~ the evils of greed and selfishness. rocks.      us and them~great anti war song. The beauty of 'Where have all the flowers gone?'  with the intensity of 'wont get fooled again'            Brain damaged~ everyone is a little bit crazy. this song is for you.;).               Eclipse~your life in two minets. heartbeat fades.     DSOTM is a blueprint for life, the message is eternal, and nobody ever put it all together like this before, or since.            It deserves all the praise it has gotten, so dont let the naysayers fool you.      Check out this record, love it or hate it. It is 43 minets you will never forget.
B000002TQV|5.0|This album is beyond description- the most powerful record I have ever listened to. Any person with a beating heart can not help but be moved by the captivating lyrics and utterly beautiful vocals. The entire album is a stupifying experience. Radiohead proves Rock can have emotion and soul to it.<br />The lyrics and images- &quot;the planet's a gunboat in a sea of fear&quot; &quot;I can't help this feeling/I could blow through the ceiling, if I just turned around&quot;- brilliant and artistic beyond words.<br />&quot;Fake Plastic Trees&quot;: I am not an emotional man- but the first time I heard this song I almost burst into tears. Incredibly depressing, but it changes to become the most uplifting and moving song I have experienced in my entire life. It makes you feel so alive. It just causes this surge of emotion- I can't put it into words.<br />Every song on this album is so packed full of emotion, and is so vivid and powerful, it's like no other. You can't describe how this album makes you feel. Any red-blooded person should own this album. It will change your life.
B000059XYL|4.0|This movie is such a fun and hip movie it will have you dancing in the aisle!, the movie never fails on any level witha  great cast that are fun and young (very HOT)!, and a great soundtrack to go wid tha movie! If you want a fun, happy movie that will leave you with a good feeling in your stomach and that will have you feeling like you spent your money wisely, then coyote ugly is the movie for you :)!...check it out!
B0000027RL|5.0|POWERFUL- that's how you can define this CD in one word. Vedder's legendary vocals give life to the potent lyrics. This album is the starting point of one of the last remaining grunge bands. The style and the fury is the reason Pearl Jam is still around. Emotion and Power back this solid rock band. Almost a decade later you can still hear them on the radio. Even after ten thousand times that it has been played, it still is incredible every time.
B000005AYM|5.0|Erykah Badu is one of my favorite Soul singers. She has an original voice. I think that Baduzim is her best album. Although &quot;Mamas Gun&quot; is very good, it isn't as perfect as this CD. Unfortunately many people don't know her. But her song &quot;You got me&quot; with The Roots, gave her a chance to reach new fans. I guess everyone who loves Soul, R&amp;B, and has a good taste for music will love her. My favorite song is &quot;On and on&quot;. It was the first I ever heard from her. That was a couple years ago and it is still in my head. You gotta have this one.
B0000057C5|5.0|Industrial Metal's finest has to be Rammstein. P-O-W-E-R-F-U-L. Amazing lyrics, haunting vocals, furious guitars and drums all fuse together to create a legendary album.<br />This album gets your adrenaline flowing and your heart pumping like no other. Hard, Fast, Brilliant. Few can kick it like Rammstein. The sound appeals to many people, not just hardcore industrial fans. <br />Unmatched. Rammstein has no equal- anywhere.
0679721037|3.0|What I liked about the book was how it wasn't all bloody. What I didn't like was how it would go to one person and then go to another person then come back to the first person. I would recommend this book to poeple who like to jump around in books.
B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead follows up their acclaimed OK COMPUTER with yet another visionary and artistic album- KID A. Any expectations you have will be blown away.<br />From the art on the inside booklet to the last song, this groundbreaking album proves no one can contain Radiohead. The band proves they go beyond any definition. From synthesizer to guitars to symphonics, the instruments are as varied as the album's tones. Thom's vocals are just as perfect as ever. &quot;Everything In It's Right Place&quot; is simply amazing, and the sense of amazement will never leave you for the rest of the album. Song to song, the images that this album conjures can only be surpassed by the art of the inside cover.<br />This entire album just goes to prove, RADIOHEAD can do anything. Truly one of the most underrated bands of all time. This album is a defining moment for music's ever-changing state. The band's progression from Pablo Honey is simply astounding. Anyone who was captivated by the Radiohead Style will not be disappointed by KID A. A monumental album.
0440219078|4.0|I've read this book several times, and I've enjoyed it each time.  The ending has always seemed a bit contrived to me, as if Lowry was up against a deadline and needed to end the story.  <br />Just the same, the idea of a society in which all choices were outlawed and they needed a single person to carry all their memories and their history is intriguing.  It's a book to make us appreciate the society we live in, knowing that even if we do often make the wrong choices, at least we have the ability to make those choices.
B000002UJQ|5.0|The way DARK SIDE OF THE MOON changed the vision of countless musicians, and defined a generation, so does Radiohead's OK COMPUTER. It is a musical and emotional triumph. Gripping and Captivating- Personal yet universal- and unbelievably powerful.<br />One can not help but feel moved by the powerful instrumentals. Thom's vocals are untouchable- truly amazing. Musically brilliant, and lyrically unmatched, Radiohead's unique style takes a more ambitious step than THE BENDS, and creates an experience so profound, it's impossible to put into words.<br />Listening through the album is like going to the cinema. The pictures it puts into your mind- the way it makes you feel- the way it touches you- it's unbelievable.<br />Undoubtably the greatest album of the 90's, OK COMPUTER is a legendary album, and raises the bar for the rest of the artistic world. Truly an incredible experience.
B00004X01U|4.0|Despite all the criticisms of this 'diva', she has had the guts to transform herself with every CD she puts out.  I was not crazy about 'Ray of Light', however kept an open mind and created this one.  Well, thank you Madonna for bringing things back into perspective - she changes yet again, however with clever, catchy rhythms and a great mix of uptempo and slow songs - no half-baked efforts that 'just don't work' here.<br />This is a solid CD from someone who has been around and back again as far as music history and trends, has bucked them, and subsequently rejuvenated the fans with a fresh new sound and 'new madonna' that is just not some 'material girl part 2'.<br />As far as 'how it sounds' - well, it is NOT some cheap 'country and western' knockoff, but a great blend of up and down music that will keep most interested.  The songs do not digress into some cheesy 80's 'disco sound' knockoff - they are uptempo, catchy songs that get you going, and the slower ones grab ya in the heart - just like she wanted.<br />Hats off to ya - this CD should put a great, groundbreaking, daring, yet very musical woman on top where she deserves to be.  Get some 'Music' into your life today!
B000001F6T|5.0|No doubt, if you first saw & heard the incredible ampheta-speed driven chop 'n slash note mania of Alvin Lee's Woodstock film performance BEFORE this Stonehenge album and expected the same stuff, then you ARE INDEED out-of-luck.However, Stonehenge does prove Alvin Lee & TYA's much broader range of compositional talent.On two separate occasions I attended a live TYA concert and EASILY rate BOTH as mind-bogglingly high on the musicianship/performance/music composition scale; and WITHOUT the need for smoke & mirrors and pyros!Yes, Stonehenge DOES seem to require the listener to drop preconceived notions of telling TYA what the heck they should be recording. And yes, Stonehenge DOES seem to need [perhaps many] more than one or two listenings to appreciate what a gem it is - BUT IT'S WORTH IT to get to the deep-from-the-soul pleasures born of this highly artistic, melodically catchy, and imaginative work!
0440219078|4.0|I think that this book was excellent.  It defied the usual &quot;this happens, then this, blah blah&quot; standard of many other books I have read.  It makes you think, and I like that.  I can also relate to Jonas, because, like him, I feel that I am somewhat &quot;different&quot;.  I recommend this book to anyone who feels unique or like there is a bigger, better place out there.
0684833395|5.0|The way the logic of the book is twisted into the narrative is awesome- such as Heller's description about one lieutennant being attractive, intelligent, friendly, polite etc. , and therefore everyone hated him.<br />My favorite instance of this logic is the best come-back to the &quot;What if everybody did that?&quot; attack: &quot;Then I'd be a damned fool to do otherwise!&quot;<br />I also liked the &quot;It's better to live on one's feet than die on one's knees&quot; exchange.<br />Read the book, get it: there's enough density, puns, and jokes here that you'll find things you didn't  4 re-readings later!
B000055ZFX|5.0|I saw El Cid soon after its release in 1962 when I was just 12. I was then in an armed forces training school at Dehradun, India, and the entire college had to march five miles to the theater to see it as an inspiring and motivational film for future military leaders. We had never heard of the Cid or any other Spanish hero till then. But, when we left the hall, after seeing this 3-hour magnum opus, we were never to forget him. Since then I must have seen this film on video and in theaters scores of times. On every occasion I was moved afresh by the heroism and sacrifice of 'the man who rode away into legend'- El Cid. I do not think, except for Ben Hur, Sound of Music and Titanic, any other English film has made such a lasting impact. Yet, surprisingly and sadly, El Cid has never figured in the all time greats of Hollywood. Both Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren have given splendid and unforgettable performances, probably their best ever. Their characters and role have been superbly etched by a screenplay, which has done justice to a long but very well knit story. Both the indoor settings and outdoor locales, in which the film was magnificently shot, are so beautiful and natural, that one is literally transported into Spain in the Middle Ages. The lance duel on the plains of Calahara is superbly picturized in the timeless tradition of Hollywood immortal scenes. By the time the movie reaches its unforgettable climax you feel a hollowness creeping into your heart, for you realize that the magic of one of the greatest cinematic epics is about to end and you have no choice but to return to the dreary everyday world! I eagerly look forward to replace my ageing video cassette with the newly released DVD, which I am sure will give me viewing pleasure for as many years ahead as the tape and film versions had given me in the past.
6301963717|5.0|You know two things when you sit down to watch a Coen Brothers movie:<br />(A) You're going to like it, immensely<br />(B) You've never seen anything like it<br />Such is the case with Miller's Crossing, categorizable because it's a gangster film, but that's about it. Everything else is completely original, completely Coen-like. The story revolves around Tom (Gabriel Byrne) and his calculated gamble of playing both sides of the city's (I don't believe the name of the city is ever mentioned) organized crime underworld. Initially Tom is a trusted right hand man in the Irish mob, but power starts to shift toward the Italians. So Tom tries to see how things are gonna turn out. Then the Irish boss finds out that Tom has been sleeping with his girl and pushes Tom over to the Italians. But nothing with the Coen brothers is ever that simple. Filled with incredible acting, a highly original story, extreme gang related violence (pay particular attention to Albert Finney's midnight stroll with a Tommy Gun!) For fans of intense and riveting moviemaking Miller's Crossing is a film not to be missed.

She moves to New York, finds a job as a bar tender but there's more to it then just serving drinks, there's bar dancing, singing, fighting, auctions of hot guys.

And this is odd because, although there are compelling reasons to believe that this is true, no one has ever proved this is true.  On the other hand, if a near- death psychologist were to flatly state that the realm [Near Death Experience]-ers travel to during their experiences is an actual other level of reality, the psychologist wouldbe attacked for making a statement that cannot be proved.  And this is odd, for there are equally compelling reasons to believe this is true.  In other words, science already accepts what is probable about very important matters IF those matters fall into the category of *fashionable things to believe*, but not if they fall into the category of *unfashionable things to believe*.  This double standard must be eliminated before science can begin to make significant inroads into the study of both psychic and spiritual phenomena...\\"<br />  -Page 297<br />Talbot gives us more than a love letter to man and the universe in this painstakingly and exhaustively researched book, covering far- reaching and far-ranging subjects from parapsychology to cultural anthropology, to psychoneuroimmunology, to philosophy, to comparitive mythology and religion, to the sociology of scientific and medical communities, returning always to the central themes of quantum physics--and the unexpected way in which they ALL converge on singularly thematic and primal ideas.  Talbot gives us the gift of infinity.<br />Talbot has created a bridge with this book: a bridge to connect the mind to the heart; the intellect to the intuition; the psychology to the soul; scientific theory to cultural experience; the individual rational mind to the collective consciousness; the enlightment of mystics, shamans and prophets of ancient times to the quantum cosmological discoveries and cutting edge theorists of today--bookending, with intellectual rigor and fortitude, the reaffirmations of the unitary voice of the human spirit, and the human heart.<br />This book must be experienced for its effect to be fully understood.

0767830555|5.0|An absolutely excellent film and a tribute to both De Niro and Scorsese. A must for every DVD collection.
0790729369|3.0|Love stories are not my usual cup of  tea.  I  usually prefer science-fiction/horror/fantasy/action/comedy, in that order.  All these genres generally have a love interest, of course, but it's usually subsidiary to the main plot.  <br />But when a friend of mine told me that she'd read the novel this movie is based on several times, it piqued my interest.  Any novel worth rereading must be pretty good, I thought.  So I bought the book and read it, and it was pretty good.  I liked it, and when the movie showed up on cable TV I saw it, and liked it, too.  I think the movie is even better than the book.<br />So I bought this DVD edition.  And it, too, is good, if all you want is to see the movie.  The special features are lackluster, to say the least.  The movie is not in widescreen format.  It starts with English subtitles, requiring you to use the menu to cancel this feature each time.  And the menus are not that easy to use, due to poor highlighting,  There are no commentaries by anyone, no trailer, no previews, no deleted scenes or outtakes, etc.  <br />The production notes have some nice photos, but the text is hard to read on a small screen TV, as are the cast biographies.  There's the usual scene index, but that's about it.  If you just want to have a copy of this fine movie, you might consider buying the somewhat cheaper VHS version.  This DVD edition is not too impressive.  But the movie itself is worth watching again in any format!
6305127638|5.0|The movie was excellent, all around.  I won't reiterate that point since it's been said here at Amazon in many different ways, so I'll let that be.<br />Listen instead to this: It seems that many viewers (and the writers of the Voyager series as well) seem to have missed a rather important fact from the film.  Someone else here mentions that the Borg Queen &quot;rules&quot; the Borg, making all of the decisions, and all of the drones are merely slaves to her.  This is actually brought up in the movie, when she first appears, during her conversation with Commander Data.  Several times, she was forced to correct him.. &quot;you imply disparity where none exists&quot; and &quot;I am the collective&quot;.  The queen does not &quot;rule&quot; the Borg.  In fact, she's not a &quot;queen&quot; in the true sense of the word.  She IS the Borg.  The same way ANY of them are.  She is the new Locutus, a single drone picked out to give a singular voice to the collective mind.  Her death at the end is irrelevant, as she's no different from any other drone.  This also explains her reappearance on the TV series.  She's easily replacable by any other member of her species.<br />Once I figured this out, I actually found the movie to be even more enjoyable, and adds a great deal of depth to the Borg as an &quot;entity&quot;.  I hope you'll find the same.
0060977264|4.0|I begin by noting that I love Coelho and find his prose to be almost poetic.  I found this book - as always - beautifully written but a bit heavy on religion.  Let me explain before you boo me off the stage, Coelho lovers!  Usually, I find his thoughts on God and religion to be beautifully written but also subtly drafted.  For example, in his masterpiece &quot;The Alchemist&quot;, God and fate and religion were infused throughout the story, but subtly so.  Here, the religion is very in your face.  I found it bearable but a bit much, a bit unnecessary.  Coelho is such a gifted writer that he doesn't NEED to be so blunt with religion and god.  That said, this novel - as his others - is well constructed, a quick read and one in which we quickly become involved in the main characters lives.  I found myself rooting heartily for the two main actors.  The ending was something of a surprise, but as always left me on the edge of my seat with my mouth open and my mind racing.  The book does what any good book should - leave you with the belief that you have read an excellent story, as well as give you many things to think about and relate to your own life.  &quot;By the River ...&quot; is well worth a read, and Coelho continues to inspire with his almost non-stop beautiful prose.  Each page contains at least one gem which I underline, think about, come back to, chew on, and then think about some more.  A great read - if it was by anyone else I'd give it a 5; I give it a comparative 4 only in relation to his other books.  While this one is great, his others are even greater.
B000002U82|5.0|Sure, this album may be &quot;overrated&quot;....some people call it the best music in history, and act as if it's the second coming.  But that does *not* mean this is some of the most beautiful and innovative rock ever.  AT LEAST on its own merits, Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon is a masterpeice.  The melodies are genuinely captivating, David's guitar playing is exotic and transcending, and Roger Water's lyrics, when not over-analzyed as they weren't meant to be (and as many people who are giving this album low scores are doing), are thought-provoking and most of the time beautifully poetic.  And to all the people saying this album has no musicality- you don't know what musicalilty is.  Everything from the masterfully fabricated melodies to David's guitar solos to Dick Parry's saxaphone solos to the sheer musical intensity invoked in the songs....this album oozes musicality.<br />While this album may be so extremely hyped that it's impossible to meet the standards given from all the hype, this album is *at least* worth one try if you haven't already.  Statistically  it's almost certain you'll like it- 20+ million people can't be wrong.  If not, go back to your obnoxious and musically-empty Eminem, Kid Rock, etc., come back here, and become one more of the few people to spew out a 1-star review.  You will be in the vast minority, my friend. :)
B000002GWN|5.0|So often live albums have lousy sound quality, unsatisfying versions of songs, or both.  This is a notable exception to that rule.  The sound quality is excellent, but more importantly, Joni's songs are as good as or even better in some cases than the album versions (A Case of You, Cold Blue Steel and Carrie come to mind) because of the superb instrumental backup and the thoughtful arrangements.  Joni obviously wanted to make this concert special and she did, she sings with real emotion and the result is riveting.  Even the obligatory sing along on Circle Game is enjoyable with the audience not distracting too much from the purity of her singing and guitar.  My only mild reservation is an electric version of Woodstock that doesn't really work for me, but it is a minor quibble with what otherwise is an outstanding album.
B000051VWW|5.0|Sade's new album is a faceted revelation.  It's proof of those old clichés &#34;good things come to those who wait&#34; or &#34;quality takes time&#34; and, after eight years, I'm inclined towards both.  Commonly, in this age mass consumerism, proliferation is often seen as a virtue. But Sade proves this a misnomer and that it is not hard to believe that an artist could issue an album of this quality after an extended hiatus.  Maybe Prince should've taken some time off during his time of adversity or personal change like Sade has done and seems to be the better for it.  This album is a very mature one.  One that emanates confidence and sensibility.  The songs aren't flashy or overtly trendy - not say that her others were, but there is a simplicity here that's hard to shake.  What it is apparent is its homage to several styles which have been distilled to their very essence and given a very cool contemporary makeover which subtly engages the senses for an extended period of time - even when you're not listening to it.  This album sneaks up on you quickly: much more quickly that Stronger Than Pride did which, upon my first listening, didn't impress me all that much, (like this one);  but over a span of years has come to be one of my favorite Sade albums.  The albums which seemed to be more produced, Promise and Love Deluxe, were initially so spellbinding and powerful that I listened to them almost daily which I think ultimately overwhelmed me to the point of fatigue.  I didn't really care for the single release By Your Side upon first hearing it on NPR and prepared myself for the worse since she took so much time off, but even it has grown on me to a point.  (I am still struggling with the logic surrounding the choice of single release.  There is so much better material on the album that I would have surely picked another) I have no particular favorite songs at this point, but simply a decisive and deep appreciation for the album as a whole This effort also seems tobe even more poignant and its messages more sullen than her previous efforts.  I don't know if this comes as a result of the experiences she's had over that past several years or because the music and instrumentation are so effective in its balance of &#34;being there&#34; and &#34;not being there&#34; that the message and overall ambience becomes evident.  Hale, Matthewman, & Denman are craftsmen of the highest order - striking a fragile balance between delicacy and power.  I'd love to hear the results of them collaborating with Karn, Jansen, and Barbieri, (ex-members of Japan and intermittent supporters of David Sylvian), who have also ventured out on their collective own with limited success just as Sweetback.  Like Sylvian, Sade seems be an essential element to the completion of an aesthetic perfect whole.  Elements of this music were good 20, 30, and 50 years go with Augustus Pablo, Marvin Gaye and Billie Holiday, but it's still being made, amazingly well, in the 21st century with the same intensity and beauty.  Do I like this album?  Definitely!!  Do I love this album?  As little as 5 years ago, I would have issued a resounding &#34;ABSOLUTELY!&#34;.  But, (and there's always a &#34;but[t]&#34; my friends, literally and figuratively), in my waxing maturity I can say, only time will tell and time sure seems to be on Sade's side. Bellissimo and bravo!!!
B00000GUZP|1.0|Deborah Harry and Blondie are divine. This album album showcases some of Deborah Harry most uninspired works from what I think of as her middle period.  I own everything of her's I can lay my hands on, but have only played this once. I would say this was her worst, except that place is taken by \\"Blondie: Remixed, Remade, remodeled.\\"  Unless you're a Deborah freak like me, stay away from this and get \\"Debravation,\\" \\"Eat to the Beat\\", \\"Parallel Lines,\\" or \\"Maria.\\"

B00003CXN4|3.0|As someone said while I was walking out of the theatre, &quot;That was just an after school special.&quot;  Traffic had all the makings of a great movie, stellar cast, masterful director, and what seemed to be a coherent script.  Ah, as with most successful failures, the script was the main failing.  The story follows 4 storylines, and Soderbergh pulls an Altman, and coherently intertwines them, a mammoth task to say the least.  The first story follows the newly appointed drug czar played by Michael Douglas.  His daughter played brilliantly by Erika Christensen, is smoking crack cocaine with her friends.  Supposedly this plotline is to be ironic, no, it's extremely heavy-handed, with no reason given for her drug habit, she is just a plot device.  Peer pressure may be a reason for alcohol, but she is smoking crack, she has to have problems.  The second plotline involves a mexican drug officer played absolutely flawlessly by Benicio Del Toro, no words can completely describe his performance.  This story is by far, the most compelling and coincidently, involves no heavy-handed tactics on the part of soderbergh or the the writer to get an emotional response from the audience.  The third plotline involves Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman and their attempts to bring down a local drug dealer.  Their performances are great also, they play off each other, with often funny results.  This story gets the least time.  The last plotline involves Catherine Zeta-Jones.  This is by far the worst story of the lot.  Catherine never could act, and giving her a role like this, is playing with fire.  And soderbergh got burned and burned badly.  When her drug dealer husband is arrested, she must pay back a cartel back a lot of money.  The sheer speed with which she becomes a ruthless adversary is completely preposterous.  She is ordering assassinations, and arguing with the leaders of high-powered cartels, literally within days of her husbands arrest.  This is completely ridiculous, she wouldbe completely out of her league.  I don't care how tough you are, I don't think anything can prepare anybody to deal with drug cartels head on.  The multiple emotional layers of the character are never shown either, because, as I stated earlier, Catherine is without talent.  This movie was doomed from the beginning, Hollywood remaking a documentary into a movie, is just wrong.  They were obviously going to put some schmaltz in there, when the material doesn't support it at all.  The little coincidental meetings and when they pass in the street is just stupid too.  It isn't needed, and just distracts.  The performances will uniformly excellent, except for Catherine and the direction was impeccable.  But of course the script turns this into an after-school special with a bigger budget.  It violates the most basic rule of movie storytelling, show don't tell.
B00000I41J|5.0|Due to his contractual restraints with Columbia, Miles Davis was forced to record this album under the guise of it being a Cannonball Adderley project. This is then a Cannonball session in name only. Clearly this work follows along the same lines as Kind Of Blue, Miles's other masterwork also recorded in that bumper-crop year of 1958. Hank Jones employees the same light minimalist touch on piano as Bill Evans signature work on Kind Of Blue. And, Miles and Cannonball interweave extraordinary melodies on standards &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot;, &quot;Love For Sale&quot; and &quot;Dancing In The Dark&quot;. This great ensemble work, along with the incomprable recording and production skills of the inimitable Rudy Van Gelder make Somethin' Else one of the premiere post bop recordings of all time.
0679721037|3.0|It wasn't as depressing as I thought it would be. It started slow, but after that it was O.K. so I would recommend it for people that liked the time period it was in.
B00004SYWZ|4.0|To all the loyal a-ha fans here in the USA we don't get to enjoy them as much as the people across the seas. That's a real shame because this record has to be one of their best.  The other records seem to always lack on lyrics (making sense), but this record really comes together.  The music is moving, the lyrics are memorable.  Morten often tries to reach those high notes but on &quot;To let you win&quot; he uses his sexy, lower voice, and it melted my heart. Most people don't realize the number of records A-ha has put out, but if any are worth a second look this one definately is.  Great Job Guys. Don't forget us here in the USA!
B00004U8P9|5.0|As the title (of my review) suggests, this film is &quot;absolute pleasure&quot;  Starting with nothing but lips, then moving to a wedding, some crazy songs and dances...and a PRE Bat Out of ... Meat Loaf makes a brief appearance.  If you haven't seen this movie then you haven't experienced nothing yet!  Of course this film has been giving pleasure for 25 years!  In some parts of the world (even in the states) it is still in the theaters...that means it probably holds record for time on screen...so buy it...or Magenta will use the Medusa on you.
B00003CXN4|2.0|Not without it's moments, but this is essentially one decent movie starring Benicio Del Toro and two made for TV movies. And the tag line for one of the TV movies could be &quot;The Nominee for Drug Czar of the US says, &quot;This time it's personal.....&quot; *Spoiler*    I mean, this is a film where Michael Douglas' character actually goes out to take on the drug dealers who have stolen his little girl. C'mon now.  I have asked many of my friends who call this a &quot;great,&quot; film to point out one situation where they truly felt empathy for what a particular character was going through and nobody can come up with much of anything. Catherine Zeta Jones and Dennis Quaid are just plain awful in this film and when her son is being threatened with having his throat cut you can't see that it's much more of an inconvenience than if she had been threatened with having her milk delivery suspended. This poor girl is just not much of an actress.  I loved the Boogie Nights guys, but even a good actor like Don Cheadle can't let you know how he feels about his partner being killed in this disjointed script. I never felt a thing for Michael Douglas and what he was going through with his daughter. Joan Allen came the closest to making something happen, but then you never get the idea that her character means anything to Douglas' either.  To sum up, I appreciate what Soderberg is trying to do here and if Traffic were what it began as (say, a three part series on TV,) I would find it worth watching, but this is not Academy Award material, or even a particularly good movie all in all. It's a shame that movies like Billy Elliot and You Can Count on Me were left out of the picture to make room for movies like this (and Gladiator.....oh boy.)
B00002Z88D|1.0|Sucks! No, sucks is too nice of a word. Let's see, how can they make money without composing anything new, putting out another crappy live album, or let alone a greatest hits album? I got it! Let's play the same crap, but add an orchestra to it. The lame brains will buy the same songs again, put some $$$ in their pockets and not even Napster could even come up with a scam like this. They suck as artists, composers and players. They have nothing new to offer and are re-hashing the old stuff. Next album will be with the Boston Pops maybe? How about a rag-time band, a calliope, or 2,000 kazoos? Hell, they'd probably sound better.
B00004U8H4|5.0|As long as your not a concrete thinker, and your thoughts travel beyond your nose, then you'll love the movie. Anyone seeking for an amazing adventure would love this movie. I would say, that if you've seen A Clockwork Orange, you would adore this movie. This movie was brilliant, and you have to think to understand this. If you really analyze the movie, it really shows how perverse and twisted up people in America can be. Definatly buy this movie!!!
0375500901|4.0|The Kill Artist is a very good thriller with a captivating plot that effectively illustrates the deceptions necessary for both successful espionage and exciting and suspenseful spy novels. The beginning of the book lays important groundwork for the operation to come later. Gabriel Allon, an art restorer, is persuaded to find and kill Tariq, a Palestinian terrorist/assassin before he kills Yasir Arafat, a key player in the Middle East peace talks.<br />However, just as Gabriel learned a valuable lesson from restoration of a scene in a Van Dyck, the reader should also remember that what appears on the surface is quite different from &quot;what is taking place just below&quot;. Gabriel has discovered a completely finished portrait of a woman underneath Van Dyck's painting of the Assumption the Virgin Mary. Gabriel investigated and learned the story behind the portrait and that all is not what it seems.<br />Silva masterfully leads the reader through the deceptions and to the story &quot;taking place just below&quot; and it too is not all that it seems. The Kill Artist is highly recommended and proof that Silva is an author worth reading.
B000001FY9|5.0|This is an album that EVERYONE should own.  If you even claim to love music then this CD is an absolute neccesity.

0446310786|5.0|To Kill A Mockingbird is set in a small town in Alabama during the early 1930s.  The main plot centers around the trial of Tom Robinson, a black man falsely accused of the rape of a white girl.  It is within this context that Atticus, the town's gentleman and defense attorney, teaches his children humanity and truth.  The story is narrated by an adult Jean Louise (Scout), recalling the events of her childhood leading up to and after the trial. Tom is convicted and sentenced to death - not surprising given the era, any other outcome of the trial would have rendered this novel trite and significantly diminished its value.  The trial is without a doubt among the most well written scenes I've ever experienced in American fiction.  Tom's accuser represents the complete antithesis of honor, respect, and decency.  I applaud Lee for delivering biblical comeuppance to the accuser in a swiftly paced yet suspenseful narrative that made me anxious to get to the next sentence.<br />Lee introduces the right characters in the right setting with exacting language to support the theme of the novel.  This is perhaps the nations' most well written lesson on the personal depravation caused by racial hatred and the spiritual enlightenment encountered when one stands defiant in the face of it.  And what better way to demonstrate this moral message than through the eyes of children who know nothing but truth, until told otherwise.  Lee would be hard pressed to top this novel, perhaps that's why she hasn't tried.  This is a novel that children should grow up with, its bound to produce better adults.  Most certainly worthy of the Pulitzer and deserving of it's place in the history of American fiction.
B000002HMH|1.0|&quot;Load&quot; is almost the appropriate name for this album. More like a &quot;Diaper Load&quot; if you ask me. They sold out folks! Bands are better when they start out with a purpose and making a sound of their own, despite what was &quot;popular&quot;. Success and excess ruined this band by chasing the almighty dollar. This CD lacks heart, originality and talent. Spinal Tap has come back as Metallica.
B00000163G|4.0|This album was recorded right after 2pac was released from jail, thus, has rantings of hate strewn about it, but does mediate with songs such as 'heaven ain't hard 2 find'. 2pac was obviously a hate-filled man, but could be heartfelt. This Cd illustrates this. This is a double CD, and the best tracks on cd 1 are 'no more pain' and 'california love' rmx. CD 2 isn't as good as cd 1, but has high points with ' all eyez on me '. To conclude, a worthwile purchase.
0897500482|5.0|I think Bruce showed just how important it was to not to have fixed positions in Martial Arts. I'm no expert but if I decided to get more involved I would use this book to help me on my path to getting better.I do recommend this to anyone who would consider really getting in touch with his or hers personal touch in Martial Arts.
0671042858|3.0|This book is good but to me when I compare it with other Stephen King books this one falls short. Don't get me wrong this is a good book with a good story and a good main character, but I just don't think it is nearly as good as other King books. In my opinoin if you want to read a good Stephen King book read this one the last.
B00004X01U|3.0|I love Don't Tell Me. The way the acoustic intro skips and stops was something I had not heard before. My knowledge of spinmaster effects however is limited and some other DJ might have laid down a similar groove but just never the mind. This song kicks! The title song is also strong and should be enjoyed loudly. The reason only three stars---there are only 2 other songs that are very good. The rest don't groove as well and have some lyrics that truly identify this as a release for the current teen pocketbook. Still, over the years Madonna has come prepared and this latest effort is worth the money. Even if you can't last through the whole CD in one listen.
0515123447|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by my enjoyment of this novel. Lee Child is an amazing new author- I love his writing style! I immediately went out &amp; bought &quot;Tripwire&quot;- I already owned &quot;Die Trying&quot; and I plan to buy &quot;Running Blind&quot; as soon as it's in paperback. I am an avid reader and I can say that this book was written for intelligent people for the purpose of entertainment- if you're looking to find the meaning of life you won't find it here...If you're looking for a great vicarious getaway, buy this book!
6305750750|4.0|Ok, I'm getting tired of all these reviews dissing Episode 1. I watched the movie in theaters and I LOVED it. When there was another chance for me to watch it, I leaped at it. When I bought the tape (the regular version), it wasn't as good, because... well it wasn't widescreen. Once I saw the widescreen, it brought back the same excitement and thrill I'd recieved the first time I watched it.   But anyway, I'm not here to diss it. Get off Jar Jar's case! Me and my sister immediately liked him and his humor. Its funny and decent. So there's a lot of loose ends. They'll most likely be covered in the next two movies. So what if the movie is more computer animated than the first three, it looks cool! The acting was not horrible, although there were some places where it could have been slightly better.What's everybody got against George Lucas anyway? I'm not defending him, but will everyone stop complaining about the stupid DVD issue and trashing all the new stuff he did in the Special Edition? I liked most of it. Watch your original versions if it bothers you so much! We wouldn't have Star Wars if it weren't for his imagination. This movie wasn't all that it could have been, but it is just the first of three! My favorite parts are the cool podracing scenes and the saber battles.
079075116X|4.0|AS A KID, I LOVED THIS FILM, AS A MATTER OF FACT I PROBABLY SAW THIS ONE ABOUT 50 TIMES AND I DONT EVEN OWN A COPY OF THIS FILM. NOT A BORING MOMENT IN THIS ONE. CLINT EASTWOOD AS THE RUSSIAN-SPEAKING SOLDIER WAS COOL AND THE PLANES WERE INCREDIBLE. THE PROOF OF THE GREATNESS OF THIS FILM LIES IN IT'S SIMPLICITY IN OUR MATRIX-SGI OBSESSED MASSES OF THIS CENTURY, FIREFOX DIDN'T HAVE TO USE SUPER EFFECTS TO SELL TICKETS(LOVE THE MATRIX THOUGH) I CAN GUARANTEE THAT I WILL UPGRADE THIS ONE TO A 5-STAR, ONLY WHEN IT'S RELEASED ON DVD!!!!!
B000059TPN|5.0|When I first saw The Rock on its DVD version, I got more than disappointed for the lack of extras. But finally, The Rock - Criterion Collection (1996) has arrived.<br />With the profetic DTS Surround Sound and Widescreen format, this 2 disc set worth of fans.<br />You will find an excepcional sound, tons of extras and a high video quality of this must-have movie.
B00004XONN|5.0|First off, anyone who looks at this album by single songs is a fool.  <br />This albumn could have just as well been recorded as one solid track.  It is the equivalent of a modern symphony. The music moves from ethereal calm to ugliness to paranoia to beauty which touches the soul.  In whole the album relies on nothing but the feeling it evokes.  Just another step in the evolution of Radiohead (listen from pablo honey onwards and you'll know what I mean). All in all spectacular...perhaps one of the greatest albums ever.  This is the music to listen to while you watch people, make art, experience life, and think. Simply amazing. I wait for Amnesia.
B00005214X|5.0|A few years ago I brought out my aging vinyl copy of George Harrison's masterpiece, &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; from its longtime resting place with my many other hoary sixties' and seventies' era lp's. The reason was that the ten-year-old daughter of a good friend of mine had emerged as a devoted fan of George, this after having abandoned the Spice Girls for the Beatles during the previous six months (yesssss!!)  In an impulsive act of magnanimity, I decided to buy the cd version of the album and then to donate the old vinyl copy to this nascent Harrison fan.<br />Big mistake!  This was not so because I regretted bringing a smile to a little girl's face, but because the quality of the cd remastering of &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; was so very, very awful.  And &quot;awful&quot; doesn't come close to capturing the flat, murky, indifferent nature of the mixing that was done the first time the album was put on cd.  Listening to this abomination, I almost cried, and I vowed to write to EMI to ask, nay, BEG them to remaster &quot;All Things Must Pass.&quot;  <br />I'm sure I wasn't the only one to make this request, so I am hardly going to claim credit for the miracle that followed.  But yes, the album has been remastered, and this time they did a fine job, indeed, restoring this complex sonic masterpiece to its original glory, including a fine rendition of the famous Phil Spector &quot;wall of sound.&quot;  Thank you!<br />Here once again we have all of those musical gems from 1970:  &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; (or is it &quot;He's So Fine&quot; remixed, hehe?), &quot;Isn't it a Pity&quot; (twice), the delightful &quot;Apple Scruffs,&quot; the hypnotic &quot;Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp,&quot; and the rave-up masterpiece, &quot;Awaiting On You All,&quot; complete with its classic jibe at the Pope (&quot;owns 51% of General Motors&quot;).   Perfection!<br />To top off this wondrous musical development, some additional tracks and rerecordings have been added, including a new mix of &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; that features some gorgeous guitar licks that I can only assume are George's.  The cd set is also packaged gorgeously, and include some thoughtful and reflective liner notes from Harrison himself.  These (and lots more fun features) are included at that a fascinating and sophisticatedweb site devoted to the album, aptly named [...]  Check it out!<br />It can be debated endlessly whether this is THE BEST post-Beatles work by one of the original fab four, but it sure is one of the top few.  Thirty-plus years later, it remains a musical and lyrical masterpiece.
0446310786|5.0|We happily add our voices to the chorus praising this novel.  Harper Lee's inspired story is a beacon for souls searching for humanity, social justice, and human connection.  We laughed, and we cried.  We were stirred by the words of Atticus Finch.  This spring, we will share our passion for this book through a workshop for readers new to Ms. Lee's novel.  Wish us luck, although with this book, we won't need it.
0553213105|5.0|The most striking feature of my experience with &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is the sense of overwhelming changes in society  in the last 200 years. What was considered boorish and vulgar in 1800 would be considered conservative behavior today. The characters in Austen's work display such subtely of thought and self-restraint  that it's hard to believe that humans once acted in such a way....
B00004SCX6|5.0|Im glad Brit did it again - again she worked with Max Martin, Rami, Magnusson, Lundin and the rest of the Cheiron producers and song writers. I just LOVE the music they do - I dont mind if they write for Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears, Five or Celine Dion, its simply the best. If you like fresh pop made by Cheiron people, you should buy this album - or try something from Backstreet Boys (their best is Millennium). Its that kind of music that lifts you up when youre down. You wont be dissapointed.
B00004WGC4|5.0|I have watched every Faulty Towers episode countless times and know many of the infamous catchphrases off by heart. It astounds me that the this series isn't yet available on DVD. This is one of the greatest comedies ever made and it deserves to be remastered in a way that enhances the sound and vision. The BBC is not fully utilising or capitalising on their vast catalogue. I am sick of the second rate sound and vision of tape and have been waiting &quot;as long as the emperor hadrian&quot; for this series to be released on DVD.
B00004TVV1|5.0|This recording is a must for all music lovers. What makes the two CD version so fascinating is the second \\"out-take\\" CD, which allows one to be in the studio with them and gain a unique insight into two genius composer/performers at work. Not only into their creative process (one of the numbers was made up on the spot) but also how they included some of the best instrumentalists of the day (Trummy Young, Barney Bigard and Mort Herbert) into that process. If you didn't know much about jazz before (which I didn't) this one will get you  hooked!

B00003CXCS|4.0|This film accomplished a rare feat when it was released in 1965, one duplicated by only two other movies.  It garnered the biggest box office gross in the history of movies at its time, and it took home the Oscar for Best Picture.  The only other two movies to accomplish this were &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; in 1939 and &quot;Titanic&quot; in 1997.<br />I watched it for the first time last night, and when it was over I tried to figure out why it became such a huge hit.  It certainly wasn't for the plot.  What was the conflict, and who was the antagonist?  At the beginning, the conflict was between Maria and Captain Von Trapp, with the captain coming across as a tyrannical father.  But he soon softened up with very little effort on the part of Maria and the children.  Then there was the competition between the Baronness and Maria for the Captain's affections.  Maria left and came back, but the Baronness left much too easily when the Captain told her it was over.  Both of these conflicts were pretty weak in my opinion, and their resoulutions were a big let-down.  The only real suspenseful part of the movie came in the last 30 minutes, and the Nazis were the only compelling villains.  So for a three hour film, the story is pretty weak.<br />But the songs are absolutely wonderful.  The characters are colorful and well-played, especially the Captain by Christopher Plummer.  And the background of the Austrian mountains is breathtaking.  The film looks beautiful and sounds beautiful.  And you can watch it with your kids.  My 18-month-old even enjoyed watching the musical numbers.
0792156684|1.0|Titanic is the classic \\"style over substance\\" film. Sure, the special effects are eye-candy to say the least but I believe Cameron (who's supposed to be a \\"perfectionist\\") should have cut down on the FX and used some of the money to hire a decent script-writer. The Rose-Jack love story (if one can call it \\"love\\") is one of those \\"trite and true\\" sappy love stories you've seen ten times over in other Hollywood romance films and novels - you know, poor little rich girl falls in love with poor little boy (who in this case looks like a girl) against her mother's (and fiancé's) better judgment. Each of the other characters was a cardboard cut-out stereotype - the Victorian villain of melodrama (Cal, Rose's fiancé), the diamond-in-the-rough poor folk (almost every character with an Irish accent) and the snooty upper-class twit (every single first class passenger, with the possible exception of the \\"unsinkable\\" Molly Brown). The dialogue is laughably bad, with Jack and Rose talking and behaving like two sexed up teens from the 1990's. Leo, as most people would have guessed, was hired for the sole purpose of enticing teenage girls into going to see the film, and then going to see it again, and again, and again etc. The Freud/Picasso in-jokes were also horribly stupid and invalid - Freud had not been translated into English yet, and none of Picasso's works were on the Titanic! I could write a ten-page essay on the various other goofs and aphorisms I spotted (e.g. filtered cigarettes in 1912? a world map with present-day international boundaries?). How this film ever got past the editing room remains a mystery. <br />The worst aspect of this film is that it isn't even about the Titanic itself. The disaster is merely the setting for the aforementioned \\"love\\" story. The sinking of the Titanic was the worst tragedy in maritime history, and involved REAL people, not two time-warped nineties mall rats and a couple thousand cardboard cut-outs! Come to think of it, Cameron could've based his film around any major disaster in history, added the characters of Jack and Rose and he would've had more or less the same result. Maybe Cameron thought that watching Jack and Rose wading through raging waters in the bowels of Titanic was more \\"romantic\\" than seeing them skip hand in hand over burning planks of wood during the Great Chicago Fire.    <br />My favourite scene in the film: while the ship is slowly sinking, and while people are either screaming their lungs out, freezing to death or being sucked in to rotating propellers, all that Rose can think of saying is \\"Jack, this is where we first met!\\". How romantic! Please, for the sake of good art, don't buy this travesty! If you already own it, bury it....no, even better - burn it this instant!
0345440757|1.0|I have read this book front to back, has anyone seen articles in the British Press? Think people should look at them! Apparently. she left her two little girls in the UK to persue her career in the States and has never brought them up herself! I fail to see how she can advise on childcare if she didnt look after her own daughters. She certainly doesnt sound like an &quot;expert&quot; to me! Her breastfeeding advice certainly doesnt seem accurate to me, i would very much like to know where her qualifications came from, as she worked as a mental nurse in the UK, and NOT a midwife etc..... I seriously think that the world of Hollywood could well believe the hype, but really, the people that know her in the UK have something very different to say.<br />A concerned mother of 2.
0316920045|5.0|I've read a number of reviews (both here and elsewhere) of this amazing book by David Foster Wallace, and I've yet to find one that finds in the novel what I've found. Most readers take away a sense of awe at what Wallace has accomplished, a sense of inferiority at the sheer volume of knowledge displayed, on subjects as diverse as tennis and higher math (yes, I know, tennis and higher math are intertwined, at least for Wallace, if not for me), and usually a sense of frustration at having the novel &quot;not live up to its promise.&quot; That promise, apparently, is closure of some kind, or denouement.  What readers seem to miss is that, at least at one level, this is a novel about addiction, to drugs, to entertainment, to voyeurism, and when you reach the end, after the unfortunate incident with Madame Psychosis (and besides Pynchon, who comes up with character--and other--names better than Wallace?), you realize that the prologue had something to do with this whole thing, kind of a flash-forward, and so you begin reading again, to find out what actually happened. If you're like me, you get the closure you were looking for, and then it hits you: This is a novel about addiction that quite literally addicts you. Infinite, yes--but that might be part (or all) of the point.
B0000048TX|4.0|While the previous reviews of this movie are certainly correct in describing this movie as &quot;one of Stallone's best movies&quot;, I am trememdously disappointed that not one of the reviews addresses the outrageous use of profanity.  This movie was absolutely awesome in its color, scenic beauty, suspense, and acting.  However, I was and am disappointed that the producers felt it necessary to use an overabundance of obscene language.  The overuse of this language was totally unnecessary as the storyline was novel and would have been wonderfully entertaining without every other sentence containing &quot;colorful metaphors&quot; (so to quote Captain Kirk).  Absent the profanity, I enjoyed this movie tremendously.
B00004XOWN|4.0|After hearing Hot Dog for the first time, I was afraid that the rest of the CD would be equally as bad as that endless cursing. I decided to buy it after hearing &quot;Hold on&quot;, a song completely different than all of limp's prevoius singles. &quot;Hold on&quot; and the other songs on this album demonstrate the many styles of music that Limp Bizkit can perform amazingly. From the hard, loud rock they are so well known for (My Generation, Rollin) to Hip Hop (Getcha groove on) to the slower rock you might not expect from them. (Hold On, Boiler, It'll Be ok) The song &quot;The One&quot; has to be the best song on this CD. IMHO, this CD is a lot stronger than significant other.
B00000JG4N|5.0|Motley Crue cleaned up their act and released an amazing album. From beginning to end, this album is full of hardcore R&amp;R.  Although I like the more raw sound, I think the crue sound great on this album, which, In my opinion is their best produced.  Another thing that's cool about this album, is that you can listen to the whole thing.  None of that skip here, skip there. They're all good!
B00004UB37|5.0|I thought this album to be one of the best albums ever!! a true moby fan I have become. Because of this I have been trying to get hold of a particular Moby album which was 2 cd's as a promotion in the States, one was Moby Play and the other??? can you help?
B000005HLV|5.0|This is probably one of the most notorious extreme metal albums, and unfortunately it's musical qualities got lost in all the bad press concerning the Black Metal Mafia, the &quot;suicide&quot; of Dead, the murder of Euronymous by Count Grishnack, the sudden dis-appearance of Maniac, church-burnings and the incarcerations and trials that followed. Once again Hellhammer handles the drums, but here the keyword is not complexity, but brutality, and he totally demolishes the drumset. Euronymous' guitar-work with strange contorted haunting solo's lives up to his own dogma, that black metal should be both brutal and beautiful at the same time. Attila Csihar from the hungarian cult-band Tormentor recites Dead's the malicious lyrics in his own inimitable operatic way of growling. Only for the truly black at heart, this make Deicide sound like Stryper!
B00000IIXH|1.0|After shelling out big bucks for Tracks, I can't begin to describe my ire upon discovering that I would have to spend yet more money on this condensed version for the &quot;privilege&quot; of owning three popular, but rare, recordings that should have been included in the original collection.<br />Screw you, Springsteen.
B00004Z4UW|5.0|One of the best movies I've ever seeen in my life. Keanu and carry did amazing performances ...  A must buy DVD ...
B000002N2Z|5.0|The Deftone's first album just happens to be their best and heaviest album. There is not a bad song on this cd. From the first track to the bonus track this cd is hardcore nu metal. I personally think that this album is the best Nu metal album ever released, but thats not saying much. If you think this is the best deftones' album you should check out a band called &quot;Will Haven&quot;. The lead singer, Grady Avenall, does a song with Chino, and Max from Soulfly called &quot;pain&quot;. Pain is a good example of what most of Will Haven's music is like. Anyways, Adrenaline is by far the Tone's most explosive, hardcore, and influencial album. I recommend this album to any fan of alternative, alt.metal, and grindcore (it's like soft grindcore, but you'll still like it).
B000002B5L|5.0|Fugee's &quot;The Score&quot; is a nineties hiphop masterpiece, sadly overshadowed by the single &quot;Killing me Softly&quot;.  Not to detract from this song, but because of its crossover status, many critics and fans alike instantly associate &quot;The Score&quot; with that song.   A truly qualitative album is one which takes a listener on a mental voyage to places he or she has never visited before.  This album flawlessly succeeds in this regard.  Seldom in hiphop does one find an album that runs the gamut musically, while remaining cohesive.  Tracks like &quot;fu-gee-la&quot; and &quot;The Mask&quot;, transports the listener to exotic locales, while &quot;Killing me Softly&quot; and &quot;Zealots&quot; do so by way of an ill Roberta Flack remake, and an ever iller interpolation of &quot;I only have eyes for you&quot; by The Flamingoes (a beat I had in mind for years!!).  The most imaginative and impressive beat on here, though, is the one for &quot;how many mics&quot;, that samples the harpings of a whale.   &quot;The Score&quot; plays out like a full length movie, and was a novel idea back in 96.  Today, the album is still immensely entertaining, and a testament to the paradigm shift which seemed to envelope the fugees after &quot;Blunted on Reality&quot;'s fiasco.  So if you are a newcomer to hiphop and are hesitant to purchase this album, please give it a try.  Chances are you will appreciate it like I did.
B00003CXE7|5.0|I finally broke down &amp; bought a DVD player just because of this film.  This is Russell at his best &amp; is the big box office hit his career needed.  Only thing I did not like about the film was the relationship between the brother &amp; sister.  That was not needed.  I write this 2 days after the Oscar nominations.  Well deserved!!
0393317552|5.0|That's the author's tongue-in-cheek claim for his book. The sub title for 'Guns, Germs and Steel' is 'The Fates of Human Societies' and any study, whether history or science that touches upon the nature of differences amongst people, is potentially frought with danger. Diamond recognizes this and is very direct, not at all tongue-in-cheek in stating &quot;in case...you shudder at the thought that you are about to read a racist treatsie, you aren't&quot;. The different stories of human history have nothing whatsoever to do with human racial differences. <br />This book is truly interdisciplinary and that is both it's strength and weakness. Strength in that it draws upon geography, archaeology, anthropology, biology, genetics, epidemology, physiology and of course history. It's a weakness in that no one person can be an expert in all fields and Diamond certainly is not. Strength again in that he recognizes this and confesses his biases - towards physiology and the influence of geography, more broadly - the power of environmental factors.<br />Very early on in the book we are told about the battle of Cajamarca. On November 16 1532 a small Spanish army met up with an Incan army 500 times it's size. There were 168 conquistadores, (only 62 on horseback) and approximately 80,000 Incas led by their king - Atahuallpa. Before nightfall on the day of the battle, the Spaniards had killed over 7,000 Incas without the loss of a single man. How? Certainly the Spaniards of the day claimed a miracle, afterall it was Atahuallpa's snubbing of a Bible that precipitated the attack. Diamond offers a more prosaic yet equally powerful explanation. According to Diamond there were 'proximate causes' and underlying these are 'ultimate causes' This pattern of causation, some of it purely accidental, was true then and has remained true throughout human history and is the basis for his theory of why people are different. Back to Cajamarca for a minute to explain. The proximate causes were guns,germs and steel - &quot;immediate reasons for Pizzaro's success included military technology based on guns, steel weapons, and horses; infectious diseases endemic in Eurasia&quot;. But why did these advantages come to reside with the Europeans rather than in the new world? Answering that is a matter of developing 'chains of causation' and Diamond spends the greater part of his book discussing the consequences of them. Basically it boils down to the following: food production, unequal distribution of resources, differential rates of diffusion of innovations, domestication of crops &amp; animals and developing immunities to their diseases and finally differences in geography and environment affecting population size and strength. I have given these factors short shrift here but Diamond puts his facts and evidence together in a coherent, plausible and thankfully, very easy to read book. Thoroughly enjoyable and educational.
B00004XONN|2.0|Radiohead's latest comes as a big disappointment and irony to what they've come to do for years. Radiohead has been one of the most compelling and creative forces in 90's music -- by making brilliant records that shine with artistic genuinety and emotional openness. <br />However, on Kid A, they're trying make it sound like they're covering some new ground experimenting with electronic sounds. Most obviously not, as anyone who's listened to the likes of Brian Eno will tell. In fact, what Radiohead does here is no more than a bad carbon copy of ambient stuff. Treefingers, for instance. Kid A. Those awfully poor-constructed songs like In Limbo and Morning Bell. It's also a big irony that people think that this is a grounbreaking and innonative record. I suggest they listen to Primal Scream's Screamadelica which was released in (attention here) 1991. Or else, you might check Blur's 13 to get an idea of where those murmurings and song structures on Kid A come from.<br />As a big and devoted fan, I feel very expelled by this album. <br />They've no clothes on, Radiohead.
B000003BEM|2.0|I am a huge music fan, and yes, I am a stones fan of their golden era (64-72), but I am at a loss as to what is wonderful about this album.Sympathy for the devil is mediocre at best, and the rest ranges from ok(street fighting man, no expectations, salt of the earth), to horrible(dear doctor),to so-so(jigsaw puzzle, stray cat blues).I checked the charts, and this album got as high as no 5 on the charts, and stayed in the top 40 for a mere 13 weeks... street fighting man never was able to crack the top 40! I would recommend a number of stones albums over this one... this is so,so overrated... now, I think I will go listen to sticky fingers, or maybe decembers children!
B000002J1M|5.0|It has been twenty five odd years since this album first &quot;got me&quot;.  I am completely perplexed how a person can listen to the same album approximately 4,000 times and still find it entertaining, mesmerizing, delightful. My advice for the uninitiated: don't give up after one listen -this album has a depth and intricacy that cannot be appreciated after one listen -it is not about catchy hooks, or show off guitar solos -it is not verse-verse-chorus-verse then stuff it into 4 minutes so that the radio folks might play it.  This is music that is unlike anything you have heard before. My advice...play it, find a part that you like...replay many times and don't be surprised when this masterpiece of an album takes hold!
B000002B7M|5.0|ok, this is the best album.  i just got into black sabbath and ozzy recently, i dunno why.  i got this cd and it is sooo great.  SAY GOODBYE TO ROMANCE is the best rock ballad i have ever heard in my life.  it is soooooooo worth a listen and a buy.  get it.
B000003TBP|5.0|Devil's Haircut: Great in all its simplicity. That guitar riff can grow in your mind easily. Plus I love the line 'Mouthwash jukebox gasoline.'<br />  Hotwax: A nice little rap tune, despite being inferior to Mellow Gold's &quot;Loser.&quot;<br />  Lord Only Knows: Country rock, Beck-ified.<br />  The New Pollution: Takes the bass line from the Beatle's &quot;Taxman&quot; and puts in into a different, funkier atmosphere.<br />  Derelict: Asian influence, especially in the middle of the tune.<br />  Novacane: Hard-rock-rap, before the likes of Limp Bizkit (ugh).<br />  Jackass: Mellow country, but goes on too long.<br />  Where It's At: Beck's greatest song ever, as he brilliantly fuses a psychedelic guitar line with hip-hop backing, and a great &quot;2 turn-tables and a microphone&quot; breakdown section.<br />  Minus: OK hard-rocking track.<br />  Sissyneck &amp; Readymade: Each great tunes in their own way, hard to describe either.<br />  High 5: This time Beck goes completely gangsta, and it doesn't always work in this song.<br />  Ramshackle: The quietest tune on here, would have fit on Mellow Gold.<br />  I was only 12 years old when Odelay came out in 1996. But when I heard it, I thought it was the coolest things ever. Beck can just switch from folkster to wanna-be rapper to soulster like switching on a light. People getting started with Beck should start with this album. It sags a little on Side 2, but the likes of &quot;Devils Haircut&quot; and &quot;Where It's At&quot; make up for it and how.
B00004XONN|3.0|Intriguing, very different from previous outings. Moves into UNKLE territory in a big way. Could easily be dismissed as prog rock noodling, space drone wank. If not for the fact that its the latest offering from one of the most brilliant bands of our era. So what gives? It's not easy to understand their thinking in following up OK Computer with Kid A, considering OK was so incredibly accomplished, a fully formed masterpiece. But a comment  by Thom Yorke sums up the bands mindset at the time. &quot;If we had made another rock album, it would have killed us.&quot; So as far as Radiohead were concerned, at the time, rock was dead. But can a guitar band just cross over into electronica and yield the same brilliant results? On the evidence of Kid A, certainly not with ease. But then its probably a better idea to judge the record on its own strengths rather than comparing it to the two works which preceded it. Everyone suspected that Radiohead wouldn't possibly be able to top Bends and OK. Which still begs the question: just how good is Kid A? Its too early to tell. This is an album one needs to live with, get to know intimately, and probably late one night, when you're just getting ready to slip off, you'll hear something that you've never heard before and it will all make sense. Until then, the jury's still out.
B000056N8X|3.0|Let me begin by admitting I was never a fan of the TV series.  Having watched just enough episodes to know and recognize the people from the series.  Now don't get me wrong, this is definitely better then Highlander II.  But I suspect us Christopher Lambert fans will be very disappointed and may begin to plead with their TV like I did.  I think they took Connors personal suffering to new levels that diminished him in my eyes.  Also if one of Connor's fellow highlanders was also an immortal then it is odd that Sean Connory's character didn't mention this.  Also reasons apparent in the script this has to take place after both previous Highlander movies (I count Highlander II as more of a bad dream sequence) .  So this in mind there are apparently a lot of immortals that missed the gathering.  And Connor being awarded the prize for being the last immortal has to be disregarded twice.   The storyline should keep loyalists from the earlier movies trying to figure out whether the writers watched any of the earlier movies.  On a plus side is some pretty good sword fighting sequences.  I enjoyed a seeing more of Connor and his first love even if I regretted seeing him be a basket case later because of it.  And the guy from the series that limps (sorry I don't recall his name) was a definite plus to the movie.  I do recommend all Highlander fans take time to see it and I will get it myself someday just to complete my collection.  Hope you enjoy it better than I did.
B00003CXDG|2.0|I am so disappointed at this movie. The reason I give it 2 stars is that it is a John Woo movie with our &quot;pretty&quot; boy Tom in it. The plot is straight and simple, and the fight scenes are not up to the standard of John Woo's previous movies. One note is that John Woo is not good at directing hand-to-hand combat scenes. And the gun battle in this movie really sucks. If you are a Woo's fan, then go see other movies like A Better Tomorrow 1&amp;2, The Killer, Hard Boiled, Hard Target, and Face Off. If these are unavailable, then go watch The Replacement Killer and Broken Arrow. For those of you whimps used to watching sissy movies like The Titanic and The Wedding Planner, you might find it &quot;action-thrilled.&quot; If you aren't that type, there are certainly better John Woo movies out there.
B00004XONN|5.0|I have to say I am a latecomer for the Radiohead bandwagon.  A friend of mine had been a long time &quot;follower&quot; and had the older discs. They let me listen to this one and I was hooked. I am interested in electronica, so this appealed to me a little more than what the band was producing prior (no offense to anyone out there). This album reminds me a little of Portishead in areas, with its own flair to livin' things up. I have to say, it's a good investment guys (pardon my gender partial nouns). It's a good enough CD to start a Radiohead fetish with if there ever was.
B000002AS1|3.0|Of all the movie scores that I collect, this is the most relaxing.  Mr. Silvestri has put together a soundtrack that is most pleasing to the ears.  It fits the movie perfectly.  I recommend this for someone who wants to listen to something very easy sounding.
B00004XONN|4.0|Radiohead's Kid A is an interesting little album, blending techno and ambient with the more traditional rock sound of the previous album. A member of the band said that this album was a tribute to songs and styles that they had heard, and it does at times sound just like that. The chaotic structure of the album reminds you of somebody taking the musical patterns of modern jazz and slapping it onto every instrument they possibly can, to try and create something, to create a musical sound of what appears to the ear at first listen to be total and utter chaos.       Does it work? Yes, for the most part. Certain tracks you get the feeling that the mix &quot;works&quot;. The most modern jazz piece on the album, &quot;The National Anthem&quot;, is crazily organized chaos, with some of the best horn I've ever heard. &quot;How to disappear completely&quot; sounds like ambience, almost like whale songs, yet its strangely relaxing. &quot;Idioteque&quot; has been described as nervously brilliant, its strange disturbing lyrics to a techno beat goes straight to the fear in you. &quot;Treefingers&quot; and &quot;Motion picture soundtrack&quot; are beautiful ambient pieces.        However some tracks do hurt the album. The title track &quot;Kid A&quot; has a nice lullaby like beat underit but the song doesn't really go anywhere. &quot;Morning Bell&quot;, while very interesting to listen to, sounds a little bit whiny. The rather normal &quot;Optimistic&quot;, while a good song, sounds a little out of place on such a normal album.         All in all this is pretty interesting, and its not just bad noise, but it doesn't hold together as well as &quot;OK Computer.&quot;

0671688782|1.0|I couldnt help but be disturbed by the unscientific nature of this &quot;therapy&quot;.  It may make everyone feel good, but I fear that it would delay parents getting their troubled children any real help. The author should be ashamed of herself.
B00000JAXT|3.0|I have a real problem with my satisfaction from CD re-releases by the likes of Henry Cow, Matching Mole, Hatfield and the North, and even Caravan.  It is this: if I knew the original LP well, then I am frequently overjoyed to buy the CD re-issue.  But each time I buy an unfamiliar CD from this cluster of Canterbury/Cambridge bands, I find it hard to enjoy much of it.<br />There have been exceptions: discovering Robert Wyatt's ROCK BOTTOM for the first time was a wonderful experience.  The weird vocals on that album seem entirely appropriate.  But here they get a little tiresome, silly even.  I guess that this was the era of Monty Python etc, but frankly the wacky woice-overs do the band's seriously left-wing cause no favours here.<br />Wyatt's drumming, on the other hand, is marvellous here.  This was his last record at the drums.  The band disbanded soon after recording this in the summer of 72, and Wyatt tumbled out of a 4th floor window in June 1973, breaking his spine.<br />As with many albums, it is the keyboard technology that dates the  LP.  Here we are up to Eno's VCS3 and the standard electric piano sound (RMI?) of the era.<br />This album will be a wonderful nostalgia trip for those of us who knew the album on its release, but to the rest of us, I suspect enjoyment will be an immense challenge.
0944379095|4.0|Adolf Hitler does an credible job of providing the reading about the history of his life, philosophy, and nation before he peacefully took power in the 1930's.  The very fact that Hitler was an artist(his specialty was oil-painting), becomes understandably apparent after reading &quot;Mein Kampf.&quot;  Simply put, this author creates a book that is a literary representation of art.  <br />The literary stile that Adolf Hitler uses reads like a novel.  Some have said that his book may drag at certain points, I would only argue that Hitler's artistic nature becomes translated into an immeasurable literary genius.  But in the sense that Hitlers literary composition may &quot;drag&quot; for some readers, I recommend the book &quot;Nature's Eternal Religion&quot; by Ben Klassen.  Klassen's book provides a more modern perspective for the reader that most people in the 21st century just can't understand with works such as &quot;Mein Kampf.&quot;
B00000J7JO|5.0|Released in 1999 and still in the top ten position in 2001 - this is one album that doesn't need a review. Californication is without a doubt one of the best albums of 1999, 2000 and dare I say, 2001.<br />After their landmark Blood Sugar Sex Magik and a mediocre One Hot Minute, Chili Peppers are back with an album that is focussed, challenging and potent. Though essentially a funk metal / alternative rock band, I prefer to think of them as masterful musicians who don't take themselves too seriously, and sophisticated lyricists with brilliant melodies.<br />If you've been paying attention to the radio or MTV, there's no need for me to describe the songs here at all. From the explosive rock-rap of the first track `Around the World' which is about some macho world-hopping, to the final acoustic guitar ballad `Road Trippin' which is a haunting ode to driving along the American coast, this is a whole album of singles. You have heard the damning of LA in `Californication', the eulogy to rock star suicides in `Otherside' and the journal of private pain in `Scar Tissue'. Kiedis as a songwriter has always been obsessed with sex, and though there's less of that here, you still have the twisted desires of `Get On Top', `I Like Dirt' and `Purple Stain'. Of course, not all tracks are memorable, but those that are will stick in your head. Especially, with lines like \\"With the birds I share this lonely view\\", \\"First born unicorn, hard core soft porn\\" and, of course, \\"Ding ding dong dong ding ding dong ding ding...\\"
B000059TPN|5.0|This is what I was waiting for. A nice anamorphic and clear DTSsound for one of my favorite movies THE ROCK. I never got my handsinto the first DVD release, although I was tempted but somehow i knewthat there was gonna be a release like this one.<br />If you like themovie buy it, if you're a Sean Connery and/or Nicolas Cage fan this isa must have.<br />and still this is a must.
B00000J6AG|5.0|The last time someone took a handful of old spirituals and blues, and made it danceable, we called it Rock &amp; Roll. And we called that someone Elvis. Okay, so Moby might not change music history, but at least he will go down as the musician who has been cited in the Guinness Book of World Records for producing the fastest single ever.<br />On tracks like \\"Honey\\", \\"Why does my heart feel so bad\\" and \\"Natural Blues\\" we hear the raspy, aged voices of black singers layered with cool breakbeats. The result is at once fun, mellow and groovy. Though it is essentially dance music, the pathos of the songs is not sacrificed.<br />On some songs, the melody sounds so fragile, you feel like you're dancing on a frozen lake pressed in on all sides by a bleached out horizon. Which was why the track \\"Porcelain\\" was ideal for the movie The Beach, manifesting when those blokes lay their eyes on that perfect stretch of paradise for the first time, not aware that this dream is soon turning dark. Moby is not a singer, but he knows how to use his voice, sometimes rapping, sometimes whispering; on this track he sounds like he is singing a poem. Mixed with his simple beatific piano playing, this is a haunting song that will grow on you.<br />But fear not, there are also rocking dance tracks here with the kind of energy found on his famous remix of the James Bond theme. The first single from this album has been the manic \\"Bodyrock\\". Listening to the wall of sound and trying to comprehend that Moby is playing every instrument here, from the distorted guitar to the ambient synthesizer, is an awesome undertaking. <br />I have introduced this album to many. Without exception, they all like it. It does not mean that \\"Play\\" is generic. It just means that Moby has creatively combined genres in such a way to make it accessible, entertaining and even moving to all who listen.
B00004X0Q0|1.0|Sorry don't mean to put down others that have a bad ear for listening to this band.How many times can a person handle the get away,go away cliche in the lyrics!? I'm talking about One Armed Scissor,a played out song.Enough of the nonsense.The singer is the most annoying I have heard since the New Radicals debuted on the radio.There are many others bands that make noise and also have good songwriting abilities such as Incubus,Taproot or Deftones,etc.This album is all noise and that sums it up! Better bands are out there that deserve to be heard.At The Drive-In is not one of them.
B00003CXDG|3.0|In future John Woo should stay away from 3 things:<br />1. BAD SCRIPTS - I actually enjoyed face-off. I think that if John Woo could get a script that got the audience emotionally involved as well as making them think, he could still make a few more good films.<br />2. EGOTISTICAL ACTORS HE CANNOT CONTROL - I have a feeling Tom Cruise made a lot of the decisions to do with this film. John Woo's job may have been just to make Tom look as good as possible.<br />3. LOVE STORIES - John Woo has a very strange idea of romance. The idea that the car chase was supposed to be some sort of courting ritual(explained on the DVD) made me laugh. I just think he should stick to pure action. The way he handled the romantic subplot really hurt this film.<br />He also needs to stop the doves/overblown shootouts/face masks/excessive slow motion. Someone doing a parody of John Woo would make a film very similar to this.<br />I borrowed the DVD from a friend. If you liked M.I.2 you will love the DVD. It has many behind the scenes interviews and the highlight for me was the hilarious &quot;mission improbable&quot; segment involving Ben Stiller. Unfortunately I did not like M.I.2<br />Some of the things said by the people involved with this film made me shake my head in disbelief.<br />John Woo: &quot;I wanted Tom to jump through the flames but Tom said Ethan Hunt was not Superman. He wanted him to be realistic&quot; [LOL] (Kicking guns in the air? Jumping off motorbikes? FACE MASKS?!)<br />Stunt Coordinator: &quot;Tom did the jump at the beginning a number of times until it was perfect&quot; [ROFL] (I suppose he dodged real machine gun fire while he was at it)<br />Stunt Coordinator: &quot;Tom has done more jumps than 99% of stuntmen&quot; [ROFLOL] (No he hasn't)<br />The amount of Cruise worship on this DVD actually made me sick. Yes I know he did his own stunts. I know it was dangerous. You don't have to tell me EVERY SECOND!!!<br />If you don't mind any of this you will enjoy the DVDwhich has as many extra features as a M.I.2/Tom Cruise fan would want...
B00003CXE7|4.0|I'm a bit taken aback by the fact that this film recieved so many oscar nods, but it indeed is a film that is immensely enjoyable, and both Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix give outstanding performances.
B00003CXE7|5.0|A multimedia feast!! Ridley Scott rejuvenates the Roman epic in this tale of a general (Russell Crowe) who sets about avenging his murdered family and saving a dying civilization.<br />The film can best be described as a dance of sound and imagery (Even before the film begins, look for the floating human skull above the DreamWorks logo.).  As the film begins, the haunting soundtrack and smoky backdrop immediately take the viewer back almost 2,000 years to Imperial Rome.  Indeed, the transcendental scenes that bookend the film underscore the ancient Romans' notion of wanting to rise above the misery of Life.<br />Don't expect the film to be historically accurate.  That's not vital to its message.  We can forgive the film's depiction of Marcus Aurelius's death, so long as we get a glimpse of his Stoic outlook on life.<br />Hans Zimmer's score is as complex as the film is rich with concepts.  His cheap ripoff of Holst's &quot;Mars:  The Bringer of War&quot; during the Germania battle is a bit over the top, though.<br />The Roman Colosseum is the focal point of the film's major plot.  Sadly, the computer-generated structure falls a bit short on realism.  One must wonder how Billy Wyler could recreate a provincial circus for &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; without benefit of digital technology, when 41 years later, Ridley Scott must rely on a puny Maltese amphitheater which he expands in cyberspace?  Moreover, Rome itself, as shown in the film, looks like a B-movie backlot (Again, I allude to the spacious &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; scenes of the Eternal City.).  This cheapening of the film is not forgivable.  Did the DreamWorks crew refuse to pony up the dough for a proper Roman epic?<br />Ridley succeeds, though, in giving the viewer a glimpse of ancient Roman values.  When Maximus, the Roman general, reminds his legionnaires that &quot;What we do in Life, echoes in Eternity,&quot; he speaks of the idea that one can be remembered as being honorable or despicable depending on one's actions.  Emperor Commodus reminds his sister, Lucilla, that their father said Life is but a dream.  Bracchus, the Senator, tells his colleague that Rome is the mob, and when one controls the mob, one controls the Empire.  Maximus's tireless journey through much of the Empire, facing death every step of the way, to exact revenge is, in a way, a retelling of &quot;The Aeneid.&quot;  These are but a few of the many themes of Roman life that bind the film together.<br />The imagery, the soundtrack and the many plots make &quot;Gladiator&quot; the latest Ridley Scott film to become a cult classic.
B000002TQV|4.0|Though not the masterpiece that the two subsequent Radiohead albums are, The Bends is nonetheless a marvel of 1990s rock. Opening with the bobbing piano of \\"Planet Telex,\\" we are treated to a different Radiohead than the one we have come to know. This album is a collection of songs rather than having a constand mood like OK Computer or Kid A, and this works well. The best tracks are \\"Just,\\" \\"My Iron Lung,\\" \\"Fake Plastic Trees,\\" and \\"Bullet Proof...I Wish I Was.\\" However, there are no weak ones. The album also stands out for other reasons. It is more guitar-oriented overall than subsequent releases. Also, though Thom Yorke was and still is a great singer, his vocals stand out more than is now common, and he gives perhaps his best performance here. The lyrics are also among his best. This is definitely a worthy purchase for fans, though the starting point for newcomers should be OK Computer.
0783117388|2.0|We've seen this before, a bunch of guys sittin' around talkin' about how they &quot;scored&quot; last night. Each guy's diatribe leads into a scene displaying the described mattress mambo. Except it's not guys this time. That's really the only difference. Sure there is more whining and talk about &quot;relationships&quot; but its the same old hoochie-koochie in a different dress.<br />So I say rent some porn instead. Porn is cheaper, the acting is sometimes better than in this show, it's more honest and the &quot;payoff&quot; is greater.
B00004SCX6|4.0|... Judging by that this is a pop CD,I think it's pretty good. Mind U,not great,but still good. &quot;Oops,I Did It Again&quot; is a great sing -a -long that any pop fan cannot help but love. &quot;Stronger&quot; is perhaps my fav with a great beat and good lyrics. &quot;Lucky&quot; has a good beat also,but I find it kind of ridiculous. The Rolling Stones cover &quot;Satisfaction&quot; is okay. Not good and not bad. The rest of the songs are rather bland but good pop. The kids love her,and for a fun listen,I do too (even though I'm a kid myself) Give the girl a break. She's doing her best.
B00003CXE6|5.0|Great acting, great direction from Ridley Scott (my favorite director) and very accurate battle scenes (Roman phalanx attacks, use of shields, armor and other equipment.) make this one a winner in my book.

0767802470|5.0|Wolfgang Peterson's classic Das Boot, is now almost 20 years old. I didn't even remember this movie very well anymore when I had the chance to see it again. DB, recognized as the best submarine movie of all time, one of the most heart-pounding thrillers ever filmed (and of course, one of the top war movies) shows a WWII period  when submarine duty in Nazi Germany was considered an elite job. It was nearly every young man's dream to be granted the rare privilege of serving the fatherland aboard one of the glorious U-Boats. But only 25% of these would return -The grim truth proved to be radically different from the shining fiction. Submarine service was a gruelling, debilitating, dehumanising experience, and Das Boot was the first motion picture to de-mythologize it completely. Within the bowels of the submarine there is a huge contrast between the absolute boredom and the action moments: The crew is anxious for combat, facing continuous boredom for days and days, but when they do find a possible kill, their joy can quickly turn to unbearable fear and panic. The horror and destruction caused by Nazi U-Boats' crews also somewhat clashes with moments of the captain, like when he calls Hitler's minions fools or when himself and the crew are deeply disturbed watching the drowning and burning death of enemy sailors, swimming towards the U-Boat while the german commander gives orders to drift away from them, knowing they could not take prisoners -  &quot;Why didn't their own boats save them?!&quot;<br />I could go on, but since this movie is so well known, I'll give up trying to describe it (just watch it, trust me) and will focus on the DVD transfer instead... My friends have shown no interest in this title, and I heard some &quot;that sucks for DVD, it's way old, sound and image are lousy&quot;. Oh, how wrong were they. This version of Das Boot has very good-looking image. Picture looks clear and clean, the original negative has been restored in this very good anamorphictransfer. There is also one hour of additional footage, now being shown as Peterson considered it better. Most amazing is perhaps the new Dolby Digital 6 channel soundtrack of completely remastered audio. It has nothing to do with the &quot;old Das Boot&quot; and it will blow you away. There seems to be things going on all over the place, all the time. Sonar pings, water drops, the creaking and cranking of the structure when the boat is being crushed by excessive depth, rivets beginning to pop being heard coming from all directions, the sounds of the ocean, etc. This is an amazingly enveloping sound, which is now a reference (I also have Gladiator and Saving Private Ryan, considered two of the best DD/DTS audio discs, and this version matches them easily when it comes to audio impact). Be sure to watch the movie track in the original german+subtitles - Even with good English soundtrack, that's the way the U-boat would sound.<br />As extras, you get a somewhat short Making-Of and an audio commentary track by director Wolfgang Petersen, actor Jurgen Prochnow (The Captain) and the director's cut supervisor. Petersen talks for most of this commentary. Commentaries are often boring and rather uninformative, but in this case we get lots of technical detail from Petersen, and in general the commentary is very useful and enjoyable. The talk about how Petersen and crew built these sets down to the last detail is incredible to listen to. This is one the best DVD commentaries around.<br />There's quality and also quantity: You don't get a slow-paced commentary, this one has almost no pauses, the group talks consistently throughout the 3:30 hours.   Even if you think you won't have the pacience to endure the 200 minutes, give it a try. This is a very good movie when it comes to content and acting, and if that isn't enough for you, it's worth watching just for the fantastic audio, and very good commentary. The only weak aspect is perhaps the (now) not-so impressive visual special effect of the depth charges, now showing its age, and the fairly basic DVD menus, but those are minor stains. Overall, I was very impressed with DB Director's Cut - One of my favourite movies.
0486407217|4.0|This book contains sewing patterns drawn from the same issues of the magazine _The Voice of Fashion_ as Dover's earlier collection _59 Authentic Turn-of-the-Century Fashion Patterns_.  Both books contain patterns for the 1890s.   This book focuses more on women's patterns; the other book contains many children's.  I collect original issues of _The Voice of Fashion_.  This magazine was published from 1886 to 1909.  Every issue mirrors the season's changing styles.  I am glad to see an anthology that makes the 1890s patterns more widely available. One note for seamstresses enlarging the patterns--the measurements on them are not inches, or metric.  They are for a patent drafting system that is not included with either book.

B00000K19E|5.0|I believe this is one of the best dvd's ever made.  The visual effects are stunning, and as a bonus, you get a movie with a good, original plot.  I got this movie as my first dvd and it is still the best out of many others I have viewed.

B00000JGEF|5.0|I've seen this movie and any movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jessie Venture, and Carl Wethers is defenetly worth seeing. Arnold and his elite army team are sent into the South American jungle to get american hostages but the more they see the more they know somthing else is going down. As the team is picked off one by one by an ivisible enemy Arnold find himself pitted against the all time hunter.

B000002URV|2.0|This album does not stand the test of time.  You've heard the beat a million times, and although it's not their fault that gregorian chants have become overdone, that fact alone dooms the album.  The sounds lack inspiration and the music sounds rather amateurish.  What this album truly lacks is a sense of atmosphere - there's so much empty space in it that you feel like you're in the room with a drum machine and a tape deck.<br />I have to admit that I loved this when it came out but there are much, much better options for downtempo listening these days (Thievery Corporation, Kruder &amp; Dorfmeister, a lot of the new bossa nova-influenced tracks, Massive Attack).  This album is the musical equivalent of Zubaz pants (OK that's unduly harsh but what's the 90s equivalent of a Members Only jacket?)
0553296981|2.0|This book is not by far the best i have read. It is all about how the adults yell at her and she does not like being quiet all the time. This book is pretty dull most of the way through . Some parts would get exciting right at the time i was about to give up on reading it. This book is really great for people who like reading life stories but not for the adventerous type.
B000056HUA|4.0|First, let me say that I did not listed to the DVD-A track (I don't have a DVD-A player). However the Dolby Digital 5.1 track is great. I can only imagine how much better it would sound in the higher resolution format.<br />Now my gripes. Before the music actually starts, you are forced to listed to an obnoxious ~3 second audio logo of the manufacturer! Then, there is about a 30 second delay. Finally, the music kicks in. This may be unique to the DD 5.1 track (I don't know). In any case, it's annoying. Other DVD-A discs that I've heard start the music immediately.
0679879269|5.0|Pullman has done it - woven together all the disparate pieces of thread he laid out for us in the first two novels, &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; and &quot;The Subtle Knife&quot;, into a stunning tapestry of magic and light. This conclusion to the series starts off with a shift of scene, drops us into one world after another, and ends up with a bang and a whisper (no spoilers in this review).<br />I was not upset by the religious and theological questions posed in this novel (and series) as some other reviewers were. They were central to the plot, and not an attack on Christianity per se. I loved the ending (some of my friends did not) and felt it worked perfectly.<br />I like books that make me think, which this one does with a vengance. I like fantasy that has depth and breadth, which this does in abundance. I like characters who mature and grow with the books, which these do, no question. All in all this book more than delivers on the promise of the first two, and like the best in fantasy it left me wanting to be able to cut a doorway there myself to go and experience it in person. Marvelous.
1878424319|4.0|This is an excellent book to gain insight.  Alot of reviews mention christianity - and because this book is Toltec based, (not christian), there is alot of &quot;be your own god&quot; advise.  HOWEVER, it is possible to gain knowledge without forfeiture of your christianity.   I especially found the chapter &quot;don't take things personally&quot; to be absolutely refreshing.  It made me change my approach to how I handled negative reactions from others.  Wow.<br />One thing, however, the things that were said were repeated over and over.  I'm not sure if this is the RUIZ style - or if he just never wanted his readers to forget his advise!<br />The best book you'll get for under ten bucks! A must buy!!
014028009X|4.0|If you don't mind some of the language, which wasn't all that alarming these days, you just might find yourself captured by Bridget Jones' terrific determination.  Bridget is a no nonsense gal, who has learned to deal with her woes in the most imaginative ways.  I enjoyed her daily account of pounds lost (and gained), how many &quot;fags&quot; she had smoked, how many calories she had consumed, and various other acccounts custom designed to the season she was in.  She was cute, and funny, and I wanted to be her friend.  <br />I found Bridget to be brilliant at times, and I laughed out loud more than once.  It was a bright and airy read, that left me with some residual giggles.  I could relate to her plight, and I whole heartedly embraced her struggles, both simple and traumatic (depending on her mood.)<br />I would recommend BJ's Diary to just about anyone who can take an honest look at life and still find a reason to laugh.  It was V.G.

This movie will surely please you.<br />This movie is nominated for 12 Osars!!!!!!
B00004XOWN|5.0|I've always been a Limp fan, and this is absolutely positivly the best Limp album yet.  Not bad for an edited CD.  I wish that all of Korn's albums were edited.  I would not be allowed to listen to any of Limp Bizkit's tunes if they were not edited.  I'm a KoRn fan, so we should all sent them a letter telling then to edit all of their albums.  But, I guess the point that I'm trying to make here is: LIMP KICKS BUTT!!!
B00004Z4WQ|2.0|Here's my problem with &quot;Scary Movie&quot;: It spends so much time trying to sick you out it loses focus of what it is supposed to be doing: spoofing scary movies. The plot was good: a group of friends hit a man -who doesn't actually at first- and a year later find notes and a ghost masked killer after them. Smart plot mixing &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; and &quot;Scream&quot; together. Even the &quot;Matrix&quot; fight was neat. So let me return to my problem. If they would have just left it as spoofing movies and not become the Gross-Out-Movie-Of-The-Week, we would all be in good shape. ... .
B00004X01U|4.0|Madonna, Madonna, Madonna, no name can be sound so good. Her carrer is very astonishing but I think in this album something has been missed. I really enjoy Ray Of Light this album has blurred all the edges of pop, techno, trance and spiritual songs. BedTime Story was sweet lullababy and Time to Remember was a gift for lovers. Even in EROTICA a breaktrought performance with an bomb book was more powerful than MUSIC. I don't know because her voice became so good after EVITA and when you listen Imaculate Collection and compare with both Ray of Light and Music we have a sight that somebody work so hard. She continues as a DIVA but I think W.Orbit's works made her best and let her soul and voice shine. If you are a unconditional Madonna fan as I'm buy it but doesn't have great expectation because you can also be frustrated. Afterwards, GONE, MUSIC and What if feels like a girl are the best tracks NOBODY'S PERFECT,AMAZING,RUNAWAY LOVER are also good and other tracks for me are disposable. I'd prefer imagine that her new work after music might be as Ray of Light was for me. We don't need a Ray of Light II but Music would be more cool and not cooling as it was for me.
1558908498|4.0|Or so they say in &quot;Scream 2&quot;, the sequel that issurprising better than the first one. While scares are low and bodycount is high, &quot;Scream 2&quot; becomes better than the firstbecause it focuses on telling the story other than tring to scare us without a plot.  The script is higher quality and the acting is too.
B000058T5E|4.0|I have had a hard time describing this album of music. But from the first song, Earthquake, I have not been able to stop listening.  There is a guitar chord sequence in that song that just drives me crazy; kind of like a Hendrix sound, very fluid and rich, and it plays perfectly above the driving metal of this song.  I like everthing on this CD, but it is loud, quite violent  at times and not easy to figure out.  The music takes so many different paths that you can't easily catagorize it.  Jeff is using his guitar in ways that is very much like the last CD, &quot;Who Else&quot;, but he goes beyond where he left off.  The pieces have alot of depth, and Beck is creating a new style here, something we haven't heard before.   I read most all the other reviews here and I can see how one could be unhappy because it isn't like much of anything else Jeff has done. In regards to the total of minutes on the CD, I hadn't noticed because I have been too involved listening to this amazing piece of art.  If you liked his last effort, this one must be purchased.
6304711875|3.0|You know those films that boost you up as one of the big boys in Hollywood? Well, this is one. The film that started Kevin Williamson's short lived golden age, Neve Campbells star power, Courtney Cox's sucess other than T.V.'s Friends, and so on, gives us an original treat... in slasher terms anyway.  A great whodunnit mixed with laughs and of course screams is one of the most fun slasher films of all time. It isn't the greatest film in the world, but it is works with what it is tring to do, make us scream.
0790736039|3.0|I'm too scared to read the book, I first saw the movie when I was younger and it scared me to death I still can't watch the entire thing. It's weird because I was trying to watch it and realized how cheesy and stupid it was yet I was still scared. How does that work? I'll read the book when I have more courage. I'd still recommend it.
0345440757|1.0|The author went &quot;Hogg&quot; wild with the lies printed in this book. I tried all the techniques described in the book and I even rented the movie, too, and NONE of them were successful in breaking my baby to the saddle. Buyer beware!
B00004XONN|3.0|I picked up the CD without hearing anything, good or bad, about it. So, needless to say, I had no idea what to expect.<br />When I heard the first song I knew I was in trouble. It was just a little bit too catchy. But as I continued listening to the album (7 times all the way through to be exact) I couldn't help but feeling very intrigued and, to a greater extent, used. Was this really a masterwork by a band that has always dared to stretch the limits, or an experiment by the band and its record label to see how critics and fans would react to a record that was not up to their usual standards?<br />Either way, the songs are catchy and are pretty amazing in their simplicity. Maybe the band is too good for their own good. Even when they create something that isn't all that technically or sonically astounding, it will still get people listening over and over. And it will most certainly get people talking.
B000056JYB|5.0|This is a 2 cd remaster of the classic Blind Faith album.  The album features one of the first &quot;super groups&quot; with Eric Clapton, Steve Winwood, Ginger Baker(my favorite rock drummer) and the now deceased Rick Grech.  They are one of the only bands to release only one album and have it reach number one. The remastering on this album is good. I am a fan of both Eric Clapton &amp; Steve Winwood and I have most of this unissued material on bootlegs already.  However, the sound quality is much improved. The &quot;unissued&quot; first version of &quot;Sleeping In The Ground&quot; &amp; the electric alternate version of &quot;Can't Find My Way Home&quot; are excellent.  This is the way they played &quot;Can't Find My Way Home&quot; live. The tracks &quot;Exchange And Mart&quot; &amp; &quot;Spending All My Days&quot; mentioned by a previous reviewer come from a later session for an aborted Rick Gretch solo album in which other musicians were present. However, they should have added one of the instrumental versions of &quot;Hey Joe&quot; from these sessions to the second disc. <br />If you do not like jamming you will not like the second disc.  It sounds not unlike the Cream &quot;Live&quot; albums or the jams from the &quot;Layla&quot; boxed set sessions.  One of the drawbacks to the second disc however is the fact that these sessions were cut before Rick Gretch joined the group. Due to this Steve Winwood plays bass on the first two cuts instead of keyboards or guitar which would have made them more interesting. This is not to say Steve Winwood is a bad bass player but he's no Jack Bruce. The later two jams feature him on Hammond organ.  The &quot;Change Of Address Jam&quot; in my opinion the best of the jams. I favor more adventerous playing so I am a fan of the second disc. It gives an insight into the creative minds of these musicians. I found this deluxe addition to be a welcome addition to my collection.  Now if they would only release the Hyde Park concert.
B000000W5P|5.0|This was the first Rolling Stones album I ever purchased, when I was just a lad, and even today, it sounds as fresh and as raw as when I first heard it. It's the rare case of a record perfectly capturing its time, its place, and its creators, for posterity. In 1978 the band was struggling to remain relevant to fans of popular music; mellow California sounds from one side, disco pumping from New York and other urban locations, and punk rock from the band's native England were threatening to toss the Stones onto the ash-heap of rock history---and then, they put out this record! &quot;Miss You&quot; apes the Donna Summer/ABBA disco sound, and ups the ante by adding snarling, inner-city bite to its inexorable beats; &quot;Shattered,&quot; &quot;Lies&quot; and &quot;Respectable&quot; shout down the Sex Pistols, revealing them as the one-trick ponies they really were; &quot;Far Away Eyes&quot; is a brilliant Nashville joke, so effective it is often played in honky-tonks to this day. The record pulsates with new energies, without sacrificing the band's own sound. Keith Richards and Ron Wood play guitar riffs so jagged they could tear your flesh; Charlie Watts, the finest drummer in rock, never loses the backbeat, even when asked to play a disco four-ono-the-floor; Bill Wyman's bass keeps the whole thing anchored. As a late-model example of the band's greatness, it may pale next to &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; or &quot;Sticky Fingers,&quot; but it puts their Eighties work to shame. It's a classic rock album, and a great document of the late Seventies. Buy it, play it, live it.
B0000242AD|4.0|Depeche Mode's Speak &amp; Spell, their first album. Showing their music roots in the most natural way, without influences, performing the best early synth-pop music from the 80's with songs written by Vince Clarke (which left the band a little later) and Martin L. Gore.<br />Two versions of this CD. This one (the import edition) featuring five extra tracks that the American Edition does not have. &quot;I Sometimes Wish I Was Dead&quot;, &quot;Ice Machine&quot;, &quot;Shout&quot;, &quot;Any Second Now&quot; and the Schizo Mix of &quot;Just Can´t Get Enough&quot; are the extra tacks.<br />I have both versions of this Album, and have to say that the import one sounds much better. Maybe the equalization was made from different tape sources.<br />Also, the American version has the song &quot;Puppets&quot; which this import album does not.<br />If you are a Depeche Mode Fan you would like to have that extra tracks on your collection. Songs like &quot;Ice Machine&quot;, &quot;Shout&quot; and &quot;I Sometimes Wish I Was Dead&quot; are hard to find on another Album or Single CD.<br />Hope it helps you.
B0000028UK|4.0|I am a huge Pearl Jam fan and think everything they have done is great. But this album would have to be the weak link in the series. Individually it some of their greatest songs like &quot;rearviewmirror&quot;. This is magnificent in everyway possible. It is just got the coolest beat, matched with powerful lyrics and possibly the greatest buildup at the end of any PJ song. &quot;Daughter&quot;, &quot;Indifference&quot;, &quot;Elderly women behind the counter in a small town&quot; are all slow and very meaningful in perfect mix of Vedders singing and McCready and Gossard's harmonizing guitars. It also has some songs which sound like they should have been on Ten. These are &quot;Dissident&quot;, &quot;Animal&quot;, and &quot;Leash&quot;. The are all solid tracks but sound a little misplaced. Then there is &quot;WMA&quot; or &quot;white male american&quot;. It has a good message but I can not stand to listen to it!! &quot;Blood&quot; is alright but definately a low point on the album. &quot;Glorified G&quot; is a little strange but ok. Lets see whats left. Oh yes, &quot;Go&quot; and &quot;Rats&quot;. Both good in their own way. This album still is a must have for the great songs I mentioned but Vitalogy and Yield will always be flawless. ... .

B000020617|5.0|I must admit that I have been completely unimpressed with Foo Fighters up to this point. The first CD sounded like a demo tape and the last CD is heavy and hooky but I found it easy to put away after short listens. This CD is quite possibly one of the best CD's I have ever bought. There is not a weak spot on it. It has so many notable influences from Nirvana, Rush, Foghat, Police, Kiss and a host of other bands that are not the normal rag tag of worn out baritone lead vocal Pearl Jam/Creed wannabe's. It is pop and heavy. The guitar work is fantastic and well textured. The bass is both beat and melodic. The drums are moody and powerfull. It sounds like an old rock album to me. It's got a great sense of humor (Stacked actors, Breakout) It has bold statements (I'm a Mountain). It has heart (I'll be coming home)a real pleasure to hear a great rock album after all of these years of bands trying to figure out what the next big thing is going to be. Foo has matured and won me over and I did not think it would be possible. ... .
0553296981|3.0|After visiting the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam, I decided to read the book to better understand her experiences. I found the book a rather incredible story of her life and growing experiences while hiding from the Nazis. Having seen the Anne Frank House, it made her book all the more compelling trying to visualize all she described. The first third (describing her flight underground) and the last third of the book (her last months in hiding)are very good. The middle third I found to be a bit on the boring side. Nevertheless, her writing prose is without exception the best I have read from someone so young. The afterword of the book really brings her experiences into perspective and makes the book all the more sad.
1577311523|5.0|One of the first things that came to mind with this masterpiece was the value of the words of someone who is an actual realizer, as opposed to the view of someone merely speculating, no matter how intelligent that person may be.  It seems to really be true, even though it's impossible to explain, that the words of such a realizer carry a sort of power that you can feel, so that the state itself is conveyed in a subtle way.  Some of the insights have, of course, been presented before--Tolle himself explains how ultimately the source is the same--but the emphasis and the particular presentation create a vivid and powerful effect.  Don't miss it.
B00003CXP1|5.0|This film is revolutionary, a true revelation.  The acting, cinematography, the art direction... you name it it is hallmark.  The shining star of this film is Ellen Burstyn in what will be considered a truly unforgetable, oscar winning  performance.  The final sequence is an emotional culmination that no other film this year can compare.
B00004KD1L|5.0|This is the perfect cd to play as the background music to a party.  If you want music that will make you dance, you should look more towards trance/house.  This is more chilling music where the listener can hang out with his/her friends or have the cd bumping at a party.  The cd would be better if it was mixed, unfortuneatly it is not.  This is a must buy for someone who likes fatboy slim or some of moby's songs and wants to get more into this style of music.<br />A
078401020X|5.0|Basic Instinct is my favorite movie of all time.  When I saw it in the store on DVD, I was shocked, happy, and even happier when I saw the less-than-ten-dollars price tag.  Then I thought, wait...you get what you pay for, especially with DVDs...but when I got home and watched it, I was pleasantly surprised.  Don't let the &quot;Widescreen Review&quot; fool you...the picture quality is not that bad on this DVD.  It's actually pretty good for a bargain bin disc.  Yes, fleshtones seem a bit redder than normal, but it's not distracting at all.  The DVD has both fullscreen and widescreen versions of the movie.  Avoid the full screen version...pan &amp; scan does not work well with &quot;Basic Instinct.&quot;  Even if you aren't a big fan of those &quot;black bars,&quot; watch it widescreen anyway.  I do wish this DVD contained the director's cut of the film, but soon enough, I'm sure, we'll be treated to a special edition...Buy this DVD!
0345440757|5.0|A wonderful and informative book by an author who truly seems to understand babys.  After reading her book, we feel we have a better understanding of how to &quot;listen&quot; and respond to our 2 month old's needs.  Tracy's routines and techniques were easy to follow and implement.  Prior to reading Tracy's book, we were struggling with our child's sleep deprivation and unwillingness to sleep in her crib.  After following Tracy's E.A.S.Y. routine and applying a few of her calming techniques, our daughter has developed much better sleep habits and is sleeping in her crib after only a few days.  Our sanity has been restored.  This book is highly recommended by this reader!!!
B000002HMH|4.0|Alright, first off, the Load-bashers made a question arise in my mind: what is mainstream? I wonder if these people can truly define it or not. I always felt mainstream was the stuff that made it to the top via radio and MTV and the like. I personally dont watch much MTV or tune into the radio for that matter. While this did get more airplay than its predecessors, I dont often hear of Metallica being on the Top Ten Countdown ( I Disappear is one of the few exceptions).<br />Back to the album. Whether or not they sold out, this album was destined to happen. I personally have grown tired of thrash days, as hotheaded temperance gets old with time. Metallica here created a very personal album with some amazing rythm work, not to mention some of the best lyrics as of yet. James' vocals are getting better with every cd, and here he shines, being able to both growl and show his melodic side. I personally prefer this to the older albums, as they seemed more of an intense bash than such an emotional outpouring.<br />Bottom line: want thrash? Get Slayer or Anthrax. If you want some very stirring hard rock and remember to be open minded without the judgments of others clouding the way, youll dig this.
B00004STPT|5.0|To tell you the truth, I'm not surprised here. Anything by Hans Zimmer or Lisa Gerrard is almost certian to be spectacular. And when they work together, they make oscar-worthy music. Hmm...how do I start? First off, Elysium is the best track on the soundtrack. I assume you've seen the movie? Ok...good. Elysium takes place in Maximus' battle against the emperor. When this is over, the movie dishes out emotion with the....MUSIC. It just woudn't be the same watching the scene with no music...Elysiuum adds to the sadness in this scene...fits it so perfectly.The reason this movie is excellent is 50% because of the soundtrack. The other goes to whoever wrote the story and Ridley Scott's excellent directing. The Wheat is like this too, but doesn't have the touch of Elysium and Now we are free. Speaking of which, Now We Are Free is a longer version of Elysium and has more variety of music. I thought about giving this 4 stars because I usually give my true opinion and don't go with the group. I am still giving my own opinion because after careful consideration...this deserves a perfect. Even if you didn't like the movie, the good tunes don't relate much to the faults in the movie (unless you don't like the music...maybe 1 out of 1000 people do) so you can still enjoy it. If Ridley Scott is smart, their won't be a sequel  so we can't expect the same style of music in any movie except this one. Overall, this is solid.....get it NOW!. Thank You Hans Zimmer...you are my new god...
B000002HH2|5.0|Ah, Bjork's cheery album, not as melancholy as Homogenic, and not as fluff filled as Debut, this album is fannnntastic.  Vocal artist is all that can be said of Bjork, her voice is unique and completely awe-inspiring, listen after listen.  Love being a main theme of this album, she has filled it with songs that only she writes, such as Hyper-Ballad.  The album is ambient, conscious filling music, that will stay with you for a while.  And that is all I will say.
B000009ED0|5.0|Purchased CD on 2-15-01. I took my time in deciding whether or not I wanted this CD.  I'm not too keen on the idea of mixing rock with rap, because I'm not fond of rap music at all. The tunes on this CD that are played on the radio airwaves (Cowboy, Wasting Time, Only God Knows Why, Bawitdaba) were to my liking, yet that still wasn't enough to sway my decision.  I heard track 12 (F-ck Off) from the movie, and soundtrack for Dee Snider's 'Strangeland'. (another great CD!).  So that made 5 tracks off this CD that I had heard, and liked, which exceeds my requirements before buying a CD from a &quot;new face in the crowd&quot;.    I threw caution into the wind, and bought the CD. I'm listening to it now, and keep hitting the &quot;repeat&quot; button on my CD player. This is good stuff! Although there is quite a bit of profanity throughout Kid Rocks tunes, the music itself is great. The rap and the rock blend together perfectly. It's got a good beat to it, and it gets the blood pumping, which would make this a great CD to take along with you to the gym to listen to while you workout!  The CD jacket is mediocre. No song lyrics are printed. There is a nice photo of the band which includes the now passed on Joe C.  I'm very happy with this purchase :)
B000002HPV|5.0|This review won't be me just gushing on how great Bjork is, and how she changed my life, and all of that crap.  I just love this cd, pure and simple.  The music is haunting and only gets better with each listen, that is what I buy a cd for, longevity, this album definitely has it.  From the opener &quot;Hunter&quot; to the closer &quot;All is Full of Love&quot;, the mammoth vocal talent that is Bjork struts her stuff, not yielding to mainstream, and just making great music.  Just buy it and listen to the whole thing straight through, it will change your life, just kidding.
B000059XUP|1.0|You know the old joke about what you get when you mix ten gallons of ice cream and a spoonful of manure?  Ten gallons of manure.  That all I have to say about making a collectors edition of this waste of a movie.  <br />The weird thing about The Crow: City of Angels is that I disliked it more out of frustration then the horrible lack of any kind of quality. I actually was intrested in the idea that each movie that comes out would be unconnected to the previous movie and have it's own unique spin. I thought that was an clever way to keep, what was then a viable franchise, fresh.  Sometimes I find that the problem with sequels is that the whole movie seems forced in a way. So going into this movie, for a moment or two, I'm feeling this blank-slate start to the sequel gave the movie the potential to be better than the first Crow. Unfortunately everyone on this movie seemed to just drop the ball over and over and after the first twenty minutes any kind of momentum Goyer's story had gained disintegrates into same revenge-o-rama that was found in the first movie. And for all his luscious command of texture, Pope cut his teeth making music videos - and it shows. He pads the now-uneventful story with at least three. There's the &quot;Just Discovered I'm The Crow and I Think I'll Ride My Motorcycle&quot; video. There's the &quot;Here's L.A. By Night, Sort of Looks Like Blade Runner&quot; video (a perennial hit with many sci-fi directors). And there's the &quot;I Want To Fall in Love With You But I Think I'll Ride My Motorcycle Instead&quot; video. Despite the fact that the soundtrack includes music by Hole, Filter, Bush, White Zombie, Seven Mary Three, P.J. Harvey and N.Y. Loose, these sequences are cotton wadding for the mind. The movie, in the end, is even less - and that's a pity. The first Crow was undone by circumstances beyond anyone's control. Brandon Lee (son of Bruce, and around whom it was hoped they could build a series) was accidentally shot to death during a stunt, and the film released was pasted together from the action sequences, which were most of what they'd managed to film. Here, with Perez - visually, a virtual double for Lee- they had an opportunity to give a fascinating idea for a franchise a proper launch, and they've blown it.
B00004X01U|2.0|Madonnas latest CD is good, but not great.  The title cut, &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot;, &quot;Runaway Lover&quot; and in my opinion the strongest song &quot;What It Feels Like For A Girl are very strong songs.<br />However Madonna starts falling into country nuvo techno dance music which doesn't fit my taste.  I have always liked Madonna and there is couple of other songs that reach the fair margin such as &quot;Amazing&quot; and &quot;Nobodys Perfect&quot;.<br />But songs like &quot;Gone&quot; and &quot;Impressive Instant&quot; are droning at best, and there are times she sounds too similar to the 80s nuvo techno queen Laurie Anderson.<br />The album is good, but is definitely not her best effort.  If you want to buy a Madonna album this is how you should by them according to the Joel Rating System:<br />1.  Ray of Light A+ 2.  Immaculate Collection A 3.  Erotica  A- 4.  Something To Remember A- 5.  Bedtime Stories B+ 6.  Like A Virgin  B+ 7.  Like A Prayer  B 8.  True Blue  B 9.  You Can Dance  B 10. I'm Breathless  B 11. Madonna  C+ 12. Music  C<br />As you can see &quot;Music&quot; is low on the list....Music is in my collection, but its &quot;Ray of Light&quot; that keeps hitting the CD Player. And to all you die hard Madonna fans, you can hate me, but I am a die hard fan too, and this CD just doesn't rub off...however I think &quot;What It Feels Like For A Girl&quot; is one of her best songs ever and should be the next single.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Don't be distracted by the nanny school of movie critics; this movie will take your breath away.  Gladiator has it all (well, not quite--there's no sex):  a truly powerful--and appealing--lead performance by Russell Crowe, stunning cinematography, the superbly paced direction that made Ridley Scott famous, and a moving soundtrack.  <br />Crowe's brute magnetism powers Maximus, a heroic figure that Crowe manages to make entirely believable.  The supporting actors are strong as well, particularly Connie Nielson (although she does hit one slightly off note at the end of the movie).  <br />Folks, this movie is BIG; it's ambitious, and it succeeds.  Gladiator isn't quite perfect: the special visual effects are a mixed bag, some fabulous, a few slightly hokey, and the performances from Oliver Reed and Joachin Phoenix, though generally impressive, are just a bit over the top.  The necessities of keeping the movie a reasonable length (it ended up at about 2:20) meant the deletion of some scenes whose absence hurt the plot line.  (You can see many of the deleted scenes on Disc II of the DVD set, and I think most of us would have elected to keep most of them in, even if it meant a 3 hour movie.)  But the movie's strengths dwarf its few weakness, and the overall effect is undeniably powerful.  <br />Most movie critics are cynics, which predisposes them to dislike heroic epics.  Gladiator is not cynical; Crowe's Maximus, like the real-life Maximus described by Marcus Aurelius in &quot;The Meditations,&quot; is an example of strength, courage, and honor.  Still, the propulsive force of Gladiator is so potent, it managed to win over a substantial body of critics.  <br />Note to parents:  while I strongly recommend this movie to those mature enough for it (and it includes neither sex nor profanity, for those who care about such things), its violence will frighten young children.
B0000509DI|5.0|The Australian version of the alternative/rock 'Chocolate starfish and the hotdog flavored water' includes the likes of some of their best ever.-rollin','My Generation''hot dog' and 'Take A Look Around' from the MI:2 Soundtrack.The urban assault vehicle version of rollin' includes guest apperances by-DMX,Redman,and Method Man.Not to mention their strong messages as in 'Significant Other'with lines such as you wanna f*** me like an animal and at least 46 f**** in a 2 minute period-real Limp Bizkit fans will love hearing the real Bizkit shine through.I also noticed that its much harder,and stronger than some of their previous work such as 'Break Stuff'and 'Nookie'.But none the less,tracks such as 'Hold On' have a more softer approach.Not to be missed.
B00000J2KX|5.0|o.k., this is not a review, but an important question.  Why are kubrick films always in full screen or letterbox format?  his films are great, but the dvds don't do justice.  full metal jacket in full screen?  Spartacus in letterbox?  The Shining in full screen?  what is going on here?  no one should buy these dvds until the studios release them in a way that gives the full benefit to the viewer -- widescreen anamorphic!
6304359217|3.0|I'm not exactly the kind of audience that this movie was intended for. I'm not a basketball fan, although I do know who Michael Jordan is. For me, the biggest appeal was seeing how the cartoon characters interacted with the live-action actors.<br />The special effects aren't up to par with, say, &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, but they come pretty close. Not all the jokes work, and the first half-hour is a bit slow. But once Jordan and the toons team up, the film really hits its stride.<br />I was surprised, because with a huge sports star like Jordan in this kind of film, I thought the emphasis would've been more on marketing and sponsorship strategies than working hard to make a decent film. Thankfully, I was wrong.
B000001EAQ|4.0|U2's 1997 album, Pop, presents a challenge to fans as U2 experiments with techno and pop music, but it is still ROCK at its finest. I pesonally find this to be an interesting change of pace for U2. First off, &quot;Discotheque&quot; is one of the album's high points. It is wonderfully written and sounds amazing. &quot;Do You Feel Loved&quot;, is an awesome rocker. &quot;Mofo&quot; is a great dance song, with an inventive and fun beat. &quot;If God Will Send His Angels&quot; is simply a beautiful song. One of the finest on the album. &quot;Staring at the Sun&quot; is remarkable. Edge's guitar and Bono's lyrics entwine perfectly around each other in this one. &quot;Last Night on Earth&quot; is one of the cd's great rockers, what rock is supposed to sound like. &quot;Gone&quot; is a personal fave. It is lyrically satisfying and sounds amazing. Reason enough to have this album. &quot;Maimi&quot;, &quot;The Playboy Mansion&quot;, and &quot;If You Wear That Velvet Dress&quot; all have very oringinal sounds and melodies that get stuck in your head, but are not the album's best work. &quot;Please&quot; is another song that attains greatness from its highly intelligent lyrics. &quot;Wake Up Dead Man&quot; is one song itself that is very open to interuptation. Overall, take it or leave it, this is a yeat another amazing album from one of the greatest bands of all-time.
B000002AZZ|5.0|If I was forced to take only one folk cd from the 70s with me to some deserted corner of the universe this would be the one ( sorry Nick Drake fans). If you are a fan of the fushion of lyric with song, Cohen ( like Dylan in the 60's) is your man. And it's not just the combination of primitive backround beats melding with oddly unique, often self-deprecating comical arrangements, but his use of metaphor is so highly polished as make the poet in all of us stand up and shout \\"bravo!\\" <br />Cohen is at his best telling the intimate story of two tortured people meandering through a flurry of passions: infuriating anger and desperation, tenderness and erotic pleasure, all linked to the irony of a self-relaized, sometimes self-deprecating humor as in \\"Is This What You Wanted,\\" \\"Chelsea Hotel #2\\" ( co-starring Janis Joplin), \\"There is a War,\\" and \\"Leaving Greensleeves.\\" These are songs chock-full of the some of the most remarkable metaphors anywhere in music. They can be read on many many levels, and this is the kind of lyric the soul loves the best. It gets right to the complexity and contradictions of the emotions in all of us. Yep. Right up to its smelly little source. <br />Cohen keeps this same tap flowing in other ballads as well: \\"Who by Fire\\" with is comical metaphors to the numberless ways to die, to \\"Lover, Lover, Lover,\\" a tender song really, a desperate anthem to the power of love over the carnage it can leave behind. <br />Then there is this other Cohen...the \\"dirty little boy\\" in Field Commander Cohen\\" and the remarkable \\"A Singer Must Die.\\" All attempts to tame or control this wild revolutionary son, either by the creeds of society or relationship, is doomed to abject failure. Cohen, swallowed whole by the insight to cut through all that nonsense, and armed with an insistent sense of poetic truth, is, as always, unrepentent. <br />Then there is this sweeter Cohen; \\"I Tried to Leave You,\\" and the superlative \\"Take This Longing,\\" reveals two very different tender events...one revolving around a tired long term relationship where love is the only thing left ( a real juxtaposition of most common day love songs is which love is the only thing NOT left), and the other centered on a realization of what a man ( or woman for that matter) wants to experience over and over again in the beauty of a lover's body and soul. \\"Take This Longing\\" is one of the most tender ballads ever penned.<br />Cohen is not for everyone. Some of us just simply don't have the depth or experience to know the places he has revealed. But if you allow him, Cohen takes the young lyricist or poet to a place that is a clinic for good writing, and the rest of us just to the clinic of the soul, unfettered by shallowness or the stock \\"literalism\\" of the emotions that phychologists like James Hillman say prevent us from developing our souls. Cohen in \\"New Skin\\" takes us into some very dark \\"unliteral\\" places so that we all may find a \\"New Skin\\" for our souls out of the chaos of shattered and conflicting emotions in which love and intelligence brings us to new realizations.
B000002GYG|5.0|Tom Waits was a blurr on my TV as I was channel surfing. Never heard of the guy.  I switched back to the channel and was hooked. [....]  I ordered Nighthawks and months later still listening to this CD. Nostalgic and humorous but Tom's storytelling and gravely voice are compelling and made me want more. If you ever spent a part of your life in a smoky lounge or a big city, you will become lost in the lyrics and in Waits smoky voice. He can call up images of late night coffeeshops and moments we didn't want to let go of. Like Truck stops and diners and sharing stories with strangers in the night.  Follow up with &quot;The Heart of Saturday Night&quot;.
B00003CXE7|1.0|The only thing this movie inspired in me was sleep.  It was like watching a movie while being high on novacaine, a truly mind numbing experience.  The whole experience was a terrific letdown after seeing the previews on television.  I went to the theater thinking I was going to see an epic, and came home deadened and thanking God that there are other good movies to see.  If all movies were this horrible, I'd never set foot in a theater again.
B00000JNO2|5.0|This is probably the most underrated album that Skynyrd did in the 70's but it is also one of their best. It may not have many hit singles on it, but it is probably my favorite Skynyrd album. Pronounced, Second Helping, and Street Survivors are all very strong albums, but this is the one I don't get tired of. Buy it if you wanna hear more of the band than just &quot;Sweet home Alabama&quot; and &quot;Freebird.&quot;
B000000LZV|5.0|Double Nickels is one of those albums that still sounds as fresh and as new as it did on the day it was released.  Funk, Metal, Punk Rock and who knows what else are mixed together to form one hell of a fine record.  History Lesson Pt. II pretty much says it all: &quot;Our Band could be your Life.&quot;  That was the standard the Minutemen reached for.  Too bad about D. Boon.

0385474547|5.0|Things Fall Apart is the sort of book that teaches you something different regardless of the number of times you read it. It's opened a lot of western (and indeed, some African) eyes,  to the ancient traditions of Africans, which for political and economic reasons have long been denigrated by the western media. Things Fall Apart shows for all to see that in ancient African societies, there existed Order were the west spoke of Chaos, Poetry were the west spoke of 'disjointed, grunting sounds' eg in Joseph Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness' , and sophisticated political organization (as seen in the age-grade system,  Umuofia's Council Of Elders and the ancient judicial system of the egwugwu), were the west reported 'savage barbarity of a kind not much higher than that of monkeys'
B000050FEN|5.0|The first few times I saw Se7en, I wasn't bowled over by it. I thought the story was somewhat weak, the acting (particularly by Brad Pitt, who looks green as grass in some scenes) could have been better, and there were some flagrant errors in it that, at the time, I felt were inexcusable.<br />Then, the Platinum Series DVD came out, and my opinion changed.<br />That's not to say that I think it's a brilliantly written film now (it still isn't - there's plot holes that rival the Grand Canyon). But, the beautiful DVD transfer puts a great polish on the best part of Se7en: David Fincher's incredible directing.<br />And as for the errors, well...some of them are still inexcusable (one in particular - we'll get to that later), but the second disc sheds a bit of light on the making of the movie, and one can really appreciate the amount of work that went into its production. From the meticulous crafting of John Doe's notebooks, to the intricate set design, to the amount of work that went into stylizing the killer's personal photographs of his &quot;work,&quot; you can really appreciate the behind-the-scenes work here (some of the aforementioned things barely have five seconds of screen time).<br />So, as far as the movie goes - 4 out of 5 stars. But, for the time and energy that went into crafting this excellent DVD (second only to Fight Club, in my view), including the packaging, which is almost worth the price itself - 5 stars. If only more companies would put this much effort into their releases.<br />Oh, and one other thing: If you're a fan of Se7en, and can't figure out which glaring errors I was talking about, well, here's a suggestion: pop your Se7en DVD into the player, skip ahead to 52:52 into the film, pause it, and carefully count the number of arms that are visible on Victor, the Sloth victim (HINT: that's not a bunched-up blanket next to the left side of his body).
B000002J0P|5.0|This album has been with me since it came out. I now carry it with me in CD form. You cannot truly appreciate music (from the last breath of the 60's) without having this in your collection. From my 20's to my 50's, it remains one of my favorites. I intend to be listening to this when I turn 80! (Best to buy two in case you wear one out.)
B000020617|1.0|Dave, you're a drummer, live with it. Louise Post is right about you. Go buy &quot;Resolver&quot; by Veruca Salt and see what a real band should sound like.
1891252089|5.0|I bought this book because I was recovering from serious nerve and muscle damage.  I was an absolute beginner, with the extra added bonus of being able to easily hurt myself very seriously with a simple fall.  My doctor initially recommended strengthening therapy, which is useful but not enough.  Yoga seemed like an excellent solution (and I'd never tried it).  But it didn't seem that I could do anything in my current state, and classes were out because I couldn't get into a cab.   <br />With Swenson's book I've made an incredibly quick recovery.  It doesn't demand strength, agility or more concentration than you're prepared to give.  Practicing the short forms gives you a sense of how to make a session longer and more useful, but even a 15 minute short form will do wonders for people starting out.  Swenson takes the view that those rock-star positions are ideal forms, something you reach after years of work.  Get yourself into an approximation of an ideal form and follow the flow from one position to another, and you'll still feel a huge benefit.  And since Swenson shows photos of the approximations and flow, you don't have to guess what's next or what you could do instead.    <br />Would you be better off starting with a class?  Perhaps.  It wasn't really an option for me, and a lot of people are put off by the roll-your-eyes snobbery of...well...yoga geeks.  Swenson's book allowed me to gain confidence and stability in a very short period of time, and I could now handle a class without being discouraged.  But to put it simply: this book will last me forever.
B000002UB3|5.0|All my life I have been a 100% Beatles fan. I never in my entire life listened to any other band like them. John Lennon was my idol and Paul McCartney inspires me. I like to listen to this particular album over and over and never tire of it. It is the greatest ablum in the entire music industry.
B000002U82|5.0|hello, everyone. Anyways, I really Love this CD, but there is something strange going on. I downloaded a song by Pink Floyd, and it is called &quot;dark Side of the moon&quot;. I know it isn't on this album, but can somone Email me to tell me whether this isn't a real Pink Floyd Song or if you know which album it is on? Ernie08@yahoo.com, I need to know, please tell me.
0767802624|5.0|I saw when I was younger and I thought it was pretty funny.  When I got it for Christmas, Iwatched and it was hilarious!  I was so surprised.  If you're looking for some laughs, this movie is great!  It's not just a sci-fi film.
B000001FO4|4.0|After Guns N' Roses' &quot;Appetite For Destruction&quot; and Def Leppard's &quot;Hysteria,&quot; this is my favorite album from the late-80s hard rock bands.  The bluesy sound of &quot;Long Cold Winter&quot; makes it stand out from anything released in its time, and although it lacks the intensity and virtuosity of Guns N' Roses, it sounds far more authentic than many contemporaneous efforts (Warrant, Poison, Bon Jovi, Winger, etc.).  Tom Kiefer is a gifted songwriter, and the best tracks on this disc (including the intensely bluesy &quot;Long Cold Winter,&quot; the upbeat Wanderlust-ode &quot;Gypsy Road,&quot; and the epic &quot;Don't Know What You Got Till It's Gone&quot;) still hold up after a dozen years.  Admittedly, doing hard rock by way of the blues was hardly an original idea -- a decade and a half earlier it had already been done by Led Zeppelin and Aerosmith, and Cinderella is not in their league.  Still, this is a good effort, worth purchasing for fans of straight-out, unpretentious guitar rock.
B000001ED1|4.0|For a debut artist, Joan Osbourne leaves little unturned.  Most of this music is blues based.  However, there are heavier touches (Dracula Moon, Ladder) and lighter tunes(Lumina, The Man With The Long Black Coat) and those in between(Pretty Baby). The lyrics really speak to their audience.  You get the impression that Joan really cares about what she is saying.<br />Joan's vocal technique is either passionate and strong or grungy and slightly out of tune(listen to Just Get Naked.  The emotion of her performances and the support of her band which consists of former Hooters members Eric Brazilian and Rob Hyman makes you overlook any minor vocal misfires.  Those who like raw honest rock with a touch of grunge should pick this up.
B0000021RG|4.0|Back in 1972, when I was 14, I remember saving and saving to buy this 5 record set. Back then I was into groups that used horns extensively, and Chicago was one of my favorites. Although I enjoyed the set here I was also just a little disappointed. Maybe because I wanted this so bad it could never live up to my expectations. Over the years I began to see how good this collection really is.<br />This series of concerts was recorded over a period of a week and is of course based on their first 4 albums. All your early Chicago hits are here, including &quot;Beginnings&quot;, &quot;Colour My World&quot;, &quot;Make Me Smile&quot;, etc. What I like about this collection the most is that they just didn't get up there and run off the hits. There are some great obscure Chicago songs here. Some of my favorites are &quot;Happy cause I'm going Home&quot;, a great even more upbeat version of &quot;Introduction&quot; off their first album, and &quot;Free&quot;. The best song on this set, though, is &quot;I'm a Man&quot; which ends the second encore and JUST rocks. The one problem I still have to this day is &quot;A song for Richard and his Friends&quot;. This was a political comment on their opposition to Richard Nixon and Vietnam. However it just basically says nothing and comes off sounding stupid. The only redeeming quality of this is that it sets up a great rendition of &quot;25 or 6 to 4&quot;.<br />Overall I do so love this set. I would highly recommend this to any Chicago fan, any music fan, and especially anyone  who enjoys creative live sets.
0517122707|4.0|Truly funny, you will laugh at the situations and odd twists to this story.  Easy to read, even if a little choppy at the end.  I can appreciate that ending this tale was not easy!
B000056H7W|5.0|There clearly isnt a more talented, classy, and altogether marvelous band anywhere in the world. This album is just further proof. The melodies are just as intense and heartbreaking as ever, if not more than ever before. The drumming is certainly top of the line, with ultra fast double bass at times, but with really interesting and complicated rythms in other places. I really dont think I could pick a favorite track on this album. Theyre all perfect. I think there are standout parts in all of the songs though. In the Leper Affinity, the aggressiveness at the beginning, and the amazing melodies closer to its end are absolutely nothing short of flawless. Bleak has an almost middle eastern feel to it, which i think is a very interesting and great change for Opeth. Also, Bleaks short acoustic beginning is really cool. Its a bit out of tune at a point, which was obviously done on purpose, and it contrasts nicely with the melody. I actually think that the entire record has hints of middle eastern influence to it. Dirge For November starts out softly, one of the most emotional songs ive ever heard from this band, but then becomes one of the more mellow heavy tracks. I think its slightly comparable to Face Of Melinda on Still Life, but the quiet part ends more quickly. Harvest is the acoustic track for this record, and is different from there usual acoustic tracks, because its slightly more upbeat; it seems to have a more positive feel to it. The Drapery Falls was the first song i heard from this disc, i heard the 5 minute sample. I began to think that Opeth had changed drastically because its beginning is different than any other Opeth song ever. It soon became a more traditional, agressive song. I think The Funeral Portrait is probably one of the highest of the high points on the album. It has marvelous riffs,  great harsh vocals, and it shows much talent on the parts of all the musicians. One thing to note about this album is that the bass guitar plays a more important role. There are some great, creative bass parts going along with the wonderful guitar parts. The title track, in structure reminds me of Under the weeping moon, from the Orchid CD, with a long emotional guitar part in the middle, but to be honest, the part from Under the weeping moon overstayed its welcome, went on far too long, but the one in Blackwater Park doesnt.  Another thing about this album is the fact that the song lengths are increasing. I know that quality is more important than quantity, but I would certainly rather have something of great quality in as large a quantity as possible. I think the greatest thing about Opeth is the fact that they are a very straightforward band. They dont need keyboards, other than minimally, to enhance their music, like many other bands do. They are easily my favorite band, they play what i consider to be perfect music. Each album is far superior to its predicessor, and i think that Orchid, Opeths first record, is far superior to almost anything out there by any other band.
B000051VWW|4.0|I must say, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this CD!  Usually when artists make you wait long between releases it is a difficult task to live up to the anticipation you create.  Sade lives up to and surpassed my expectation with &quot;Lovers Rock&quot;.  She does not deviate from doing the things that made her unique to all of us.  Her sound is still soulful, her voice still sweet and low, and her lyrics are still very meaningful.  The entire CD is filled with her slow melodic tunes and is very relaxing and inspiring!  I have to recommend this CD, it is a great buy!
B000002IST|4.0|I'm a huge Genesis fan.  After more than 20 years and the band now basically finished, I still love them.  But for a long time, I was greatly biased in favor of everything up to and including Duke, and greatly biased against everything from ABACAB to, well, basically anything 80s.  I still bought the albums and went to their concerts because, afterall, these guys are Genesis.  I have no choice.  Only in the last few years have I given the 80s music a real chance, and I have to say, there is some really great stuff on each of those albums.  It's just that, unlike Duke and before, 80s albums were inconsistent.  But old fans should give Home By The Sea, Second Home By The Sea, Domino and The Brazilian a listen -- just as good as anything from the 70s in my opinion.  But I digress...<br />When ABACAB came out, I was in shock -- and so were most Genesis fans.  But we survived. When Genesis (aka the Mama album) came out in 83, we were once again shocked (surely, ABACAB was an experiment, right?)  A tear in my eye, I nevertheless survived.  Then Invisible Touch came out -- a good pop album to be sure, with some feignts toward Rock.  But Genesis is (or was) a wonderfully creative progressive Rock band, yes?  Oh well.  Each of these albums had some great moments, but I was used to listening to Genesis albums from start to finish and feeling chills at everything.  Begining with Abacab and continuing on through the 80s I had to actually skip songs to get to the good stuff -- something no true Genesis fan has ever experienced.  Still good music, but not awe inspiring rock like before.<br />And then, after five years of waiting, We Can't Dance came out.  Sure, it had the obligatory singles (No Son of Mine, etc.), but this album contained some truly wonderful music -- dare I say it, awe inspiring!  I know a lot of long time fans gave up after ABACAB and don't like this one much either. I guess I would say that while We Can't Dance is not a complete journey back to the old days, it certainly pays tribute to them in large style. Also, like all the classic Genesis albums, this one has a distinctive, full and frequently orchestral sound.  Each song, or at least most of them, fits pretty well with the next.  If you like older Genesis, but want something a little more contemporary, this is a solid album.  Tony Banks gets to flex some song-writing and keyboarding muscle after nearly ten years off, so to speak, which is great (Tony's Fading Lights is absolutely one of the best Genesis tracks ever, in my opinion).  Solid Drumming, nice vocals, classic big Genesis sound.  Never A Time even sounds like something off of Duke (Sweet!).  The only stinker is &quot;I Can't Dance.&quot;  I'm not even sure if that one qualifies as music.  But overall We Can't Dance is quite enjoyable; better still, at least four songs off this album are Genesis classics (Driving The Last Spike, Dreaming While You Sleep, Living Forever and, of course, Fading Lights) that would fit comfortably on Wind &amp; Wuthering, And Then There Were Three or Duke.  Buy it.
B00004X01U|4.0|To Madonna...here's how you scored on the following tracks.<br />1. Music: B- Nice song, but it gets old after a while. The lyrics are rather infantile, but I suppose it fits the creative vision of this song.<br />2. Impressive Instant: A-  Love the tension you build up in this song. The concept of a person catching a glance of someone beautiful, but never holding a conversation with them or knowing them but like them immensely on first sight is a great concept for a song and many people can identify with it. I can.<br />3. Runaway Lover: C+  Loved the beginning intro, but the song tapers off and becomes dull rather fast. The lyrics seem nonsensical.<br />4. I Deserve It: B+  Great song!<br />5. Amazing: A-  Like the atmospheric rhythm.<br />6. Nobody's Perfect: A  Now this is a song that I like. She did a good job on this one. Loved the lyrics and the sound.<br />7. Don't Tell Me: A-  Great song. Loved the guitar licks.<br />8. What It Feels Like For A Girl: B  Nice little song.<br />9. Paradise (Not For Me): C  Nothing special.<br />10. Gone: C  Work harder, Madonna, nothing special once again.<br />Overall grade: A-/B+  Good album.
B000002J29|5.0|There's not much I can say beyond what most everyone here has said.  So, I'll keep it to my quick two cents.  This album is brilliant, breath-taking, musically perfect.  Tony, Mike, Phil and Steve (his last with the band) have always been underdogs.  And yet, listen to these geniuses play live and you have to wonder why every other rock band in the business didn't just pack it in and say &quot;we're not worthy&quot; (which, of course, they're not).  How so much talent can reside is just four people is a riddle for the ages.  This live recording is a masterpiece in the most pure and genuine sense of that word.  It puts most anyone else's studio albums to shame.  Of course, Genesis -- especially from this era -- puts every other band to shame. And if you want to hear some truly amazing keyboard work, then this is the album for you.  His name is Tony Banks.  He is to the music business what Einstein was to Physics.  Don't think.  Just buy this CD.  Then listen, and don't stop.
B00000253N|5.0|This album is so amazing that it is almost too difficult to put in to words.  In my opinion, this is Dylan's greatest album, and one of the best in music history.  This was the first Dylan album i bought after the greatest hits cd's.  Since then i have bought many of his other albums, and all of them are great, but nothing compares to the feeling this album gives me.  Everything goes away, the music just absorbs you.<br />While some of these songs are not as well known as others, the whole album just flows together to make a true listening experience.  The cd opens with &quot;tangled up in blue&quot;, an incredible song in it's own right, it also opens his greatest hits volume 3.  This song just sets the tone for the whole album.  It's difficult to just name a couple songs, because they all are great.  My own personal favorite here is &quot;Lily, Rosemary, and the Jack of Hearts&quot;.  This song is an epic, continuing with verse after verse, showing Dylan's mastery in using a song to tell a story, and after hearing it, it leaves me so drained, simply because it is so intense.<br />This album came right after his divorce, so it isn't a love cd, but you can feel all Dylan's emotions shining through in his songs, and it makes it truly incredible.  While it is hard to say one of Dylan's album is truly the best, since they are all magnificent, this is the one i am always listening to.
014100018X|3.0|Vivanne Rocher (nice connection to Ferraro Rocher:  YUM!)brings mysterious qualities and good chocolate to Lansquenet at the time of festival.  This story of the pagan chocolatier allegorically debunks the stifling position of the Catholic church's blemished control of a small, staid French town.  Gradually Vivanne seduces the townspeople out of their rut and into living and loving life.  A tale of good versus evil with a wry twist, this little book brings back memories of beautiful Swiss chocolate shop window displays on a summer trip long past.  In the case of this little war, the gypsy good wins out over the corrupted town and church leaders.
B000002KAT|5.0|While this album only has one song, &quot;sweet thing&quot;, which is contained on the best of van morrison album, that does not mean this album does not shine as a whole as well.  Already owning Moondance, and the Best of, i was looking for another van morrison cd, i had heard good things about this one.  This album holds up to both of those, and Van shows once again why he is one of the greatest musicians out there.
6303433766|5.0|Heavenly Creatures is the disturbing true tale of two girls whose inspirational love leads to parental conflict and matricide. I loved this film because I felt left out at school, still dreaming about magicalthings, and fed up because i wasn't one of the girls who heard the word 'fantasy' and burst into high-pitched giggles. Juliet is a character some girls may sympathise with-the spoilt, parentally starved young snob who is used to getting her  own way no matter what, but I relate to Paul, living in a simple, strict family system where you work for a living, and she yearsn to break free and realise her own mind. I think the scenes of Borovnia, the plasticene kingdom, were a bit bland and boring though, and the castle and its many people seemed a bit restricted-there could have been more work there. I also think there should have been more tantalising glimpses of the 'Fourth World' not just an English garden and big butterfly's. All in all i rate this film five stars-and add that I think its a bit unjust that Juliet is now millionaire mystery writer Anne Perry and there is no sign of Pauline, without whose diaries this story would not have been recognised.

0887306128|5.0|Have you ever run into executives who create more harm than good?  Do you realize that some people may see you that way, at least in some situations.<br />One of the most famous quotes by Peter Drucker is that he sometimes refers to himself as an &quot;insultant&quot; rather than a consultant.  His straight talk in this book will direct you onto the right path for helping your organization accomplish more.<br />Peter Drucker begins this book by pointing out that there is no science of how to improve executive effectiveness, nor any naturally-occurring effective executives. The redeeming point of this problem is that he argues that executive effectiveness can be learned.<br />The principles begin with a focus on time management. We can get greater quantities of every other resource we need, except time. Drucker reports that executives spend their time much differently than they think they do and much differently than they would like to. His solution is to begin by measuring how you spend your time, and compare it with an ideal allocation. Than begin to systematically get rid of the unimportant in favor of the important. His suggestions include stopping some things, delegation, creating policy decisions to replace ad hoc decisions, staying out of things that others should do, and so forth. Any student of time management will recognize the list he suggests. One of the best points is to give yourself large blocks of uninterrupted time to do more significant tasks.

B000050XEI|5.0|Enya's &quot;Only Time&quot; was the closing music on Providence (2-16-01) and it provided the most haunting and poignant background for what were very emotional scenes. That alone has convinced me to get to know Enya's music better.
B0000027RL|5.0|It took me a while to get into this album but after a listen or two It's become one of my favorite albums, I must play it everyday! Every song is a classic with great riffs and an ever better vocalist - Eddie Vedder is amazing, if you like Van Halen's ex David Lee Roth, you'll be a home with Vedder.   Basically, if you are a rock fan, you'll love this.  Buy.
6302038308|5.0|Although Evil Dead 2 isn't quite as good as the first one, it is very close. The major difference between the two movies is that this sequel is pretty much a black comedy, even paying tribute to the Three Stooges. Although are some moments of Evil Dead that could be considered funny, nothing comes close to some of the moments in this movie such as Ash's hand turned evil hitting him over the head with dishes, and after knocking him out, drags him across the floor. Although some of the humor is subtle, for instance after Ash cuts off his hand and puts it under the bucket, the book he uses to weigh the bucket down is A Farewell To Arms. Evil Dead 2, however, is just as violent and fast paced as the original. If you liked the first one, you will like this one at least as much.
B000000OQF|5.0|Guns N' Roses are THE finest band ever formed and this is their best album, which also is the best album on the face of the earth, nothing will beat it!  [I'm a little GN'FR biased] but it's the best rock album ever.  Every song is an instant classic with Sweet Child O' Mine being my fave song of all time along with my fave solo.  Everyone needs a copy of AFD, you life ain't complete without it.  Also, try out Slash's Snakepit's 'Ain't Life Grand' if you like this [let's face it, who wouldn't like Appetite?]  Cheers!
B00002DESX|5.0|The Ramones debut album was the first punk album. One could argue that the albums by MC5, the Stooges and, most notably, The Velvet Underground were the first punk albums. Although punk would not exist without these three bands, none of these bands are actually punk. The Ramones are truly the first real punk band. The Ramones self-titled debut ranks, along with The Clash, London Calling, and Machine Gun Etiquette as one of the greatest punk albums of all time. All 14 songs on their debut are short, catchy and full of energy. That is waht makes the Ramones so good. The standouts on this album are Blitzkrieg Bop, I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend and a great cover of Let's Dance. This is the Ramones best album and is essential to any punk fan.
0679879269|5.0|As were the other two, this book is amazing, and wonderful, and heartbreaking. <br />Those bashing the book for what they perceive as its anti-Christian bent need to stop and think for a moment: the book is set in a universe that fairly clearly isn't our own -- unless you've been noticing windows opening between worlds recently. Ranting about how Pullman is offending you because of his portrayal of the Church throughout this series makes about as much sense as complaining that daemons don't actually exist. <br />It's fantasy; detach yourself and enjoy it.
B000002UD1|5.0|I don't know why so many people gave this album a bad review. True, it isn't quite as good as Imagine and it isn't really close to Plastic Ono Band, but it does remain a great album with some really great songs. The title track is one of Lennon's best songs. Tight As is a really good rocker, while Aisumasen is a nice quieter song. Bring On The Lucie, although king of a dumb title, is a really great song. I Know and Only People are also stand outs. This is definitely worth getting for any Lennon fan.
B00004XONN|5.0|Folks, if you didn't like anything of radiohead in the past, pick up this CD. If you DId enjoy all of Radiohead in the past, pick up this CD. Musical Masterpiece comes to mind, but isn't how you describe this record.  When you think of groundbreaking albums, you only consider ones that SOLD numerous copies. You never consider the ones that opened the door for new genre's of music, or variety from the same band. Thom Yorke and gang do it successfully by teasing every part of your body with this colorfully bland CD. Rock, which is the category Radiohead falls under, is nowhere NEAR what this CD should be titled as.<br />Pick it up today!
014028009X|2.0|After the rave reviews I was looking forward to this one, but was sorely disappointed. The main character is a total stereotype--obsessed with finding a boyfriend, cigarettes, weight and chocolate--maybe in reverse order. Her job fills time she would otherwise spend eating and smoking.  Why is it that no one writes books like this about guys? Portrayals of women like this aren't that funny to begin with, and this one wore thin quickly. Don't waste your time on the sequel--I didn't.
B000021XR5|5.0|The first eight months of 1999 were horrible as far as rock music goes...the low point of the 90's.<br />Then &quot;Down&quot; exploded on radio as the first single from the nearly-forgotten Stone Temple Pilots' fourth release, &quot;No. 4&quot;.<br />&quot;Down&quot; was arguably the best rock song of that year.<br />The rest of the album wasn't far behind.<br />&quot;Down&quot; is probably the hardest and one of the best STP tracks ever, except maybe for &quot;Piece of Pie&quot;, &quot;Crackerman&quot;, or &quot;Sex Type Thing&quot; off their album Core, depending on how you define &quot;hard&quot;.  <br />&quot;Heaven and Hot Rods&quot; is a mirror image of &quot;Sex Type Thing&quot;.  It is track two on the CD, like &quot;STT&quot;, it has the same bouncing, uptempo beat, the same kickass crunching guitars, and the same completely crazy blood-sex-sweat vibe.  A true classic STP song.<br />&quot;Pruno&quot; is a weird alternative type song that at first seems god-awful but slowly turns into one of the best tracks on the album.  It rocks and rocks and rocks and rocks throughout all 3 minutes 14 seconds of its existence.<br />&quot;Church on Tuesday&quot; is another weird one, but is equally as good as &quot;Pruno&quot;.  It's a little softer and less jagged-edged, though.  Great hooks abound in this song.<br />&quot;Sour Girl&quot; is an overplayed modern rock song that STP should not have released as a single.  But beyond that, it's a great melodic tune that's actually quite sad after you listen to it for a bit.<br />&quot;No Way Out&quot; is another hard-rocking track, like something off Core, but if you listened to &quot;No Way Out&quot; and &quot;Wicked Garden&quot; side by side, you could tell which one was recorded in 1992 and which one was recorded in 1999.  Definite modern vibe to it.<br />&quot;Sex &amp; Violence&quot; is one cool song.  Combining the raw riffs and beats of a late-70's punk song, the song structures of a modern rock song, and Scott Weiland's great voice, this track is a winner.<br />&quot;Glide&quot; is my favorite track off the album.  It sounds like Oasis meets Radiohead meets Third Eye Blind and is unlike anything STP has ever done. But that's a good thing.  The shimmering guitar lines will make you feel like you're flying into the sun.<br />&quot;I Got You&quot; is a sixties-influenced melancholy countryish song that sounds like nothing else on this album.  Slow, brooding, beautiful.<br />&quot;MC5&quot; has the same basic formula as &quot;Down&quot;: hard drums and loud guitars, but has little success.  The weakest track on this album, but great compared to most other modern rock bands' songs.<br />&quot;Atlanta&quot; is a slow, Doors-ish closer.  It's amazing how much this actually does sound like a Doors song.<br />The bottom line is, this album is not for teenage girls who like 3 Doors Down and 'NSYNC and think they're cool if they buy a Stone Temple Pilots album because they saw the &quot;Sour Girl&quot; video on MTV.  This album is for people who like the raw energy of being in the front row of the best rock concert ever.  There's no fancy production here, just raw rock tunes.  This IS rock n' roll.
B00003CXAR|5.0|Back in 1974, I was browsing the paperback book shelves at my local supermarket when I noticed the very intriguing cover of a novel called simply Jaws.  I picked it up and thought it might be interesting, so I bought it.  That evening I lay on the couch, eating peanuts, and started reading it.  I finished the peanuts quickly, but I didn't stop reading the book until I had finished it, too, much later that night!<br />The movie came out the next year, but I didn't go see it, despite all the hype and its huge success at the box-office.  I had read the book and I knew the movie wouldn't be as good as the book.  They never were, I thought.<br />But when I finally saw Jaws, uncut on pay-TV, I realized I was wrong--the movie was better than the book!  The book had a love affair between Hooper and Brody's wife, an unexplored underworld involvement on Amity Island, and Hooper was killed by the great white shark at the end.  Not to mention that the shark just rolled over and died of its wounds just in time to spare Brody's life.  Such an ending in the book was believable, but not very exciting.  Spielberg wisely deleted all these extraneous elements and cut right to the chase, and made a taut, suspenseful, exciting film, one that is enjoyable time after time!<br />And this 25th anniversary DVD edition is great!  The menus are easy to read and use against a scene of the deep blue ocean, there's commentary by Spielberg, Benchley, and others about the making of the movie,  deleted scenes, outtakes, photos, trivia game, and more!  This is a superb DVD, and should be in the collection of every Spielberg/Jaws fan!
B000002GQH|5.0|I purchased this LP in 1970- and like prior Moody Blues records I planned to listen to it with headphones in a darkened room. Being a school night I had to sneak a listen the following morning prior to my walk to school. After listening to &quot;The Beginning&quot; I had to lift the tone arm and plan for a Friday evening listen. I knew this was going to be a VERY GOOD Moody Blues record. 30 years later I have this REMASTER in my CD changer in my car and listen on my way to and from work. I think the REMASTER is not sonically revealing as the tracks form this set that appear on the out of print &quot;This Is The Moody Blues&quot;, but that CD was a remix. But some things stick out- On the LP version &quot;To Share Our Love&quot; the tambourine was much more predominate during the thudding intro to this tune. But I also noticed that Mike Pinder is the lead vocalist on this John Lodge track. Lodge's Moody Blues songs featured the group vocal sound-a sound that producer Tony Clarke always did a top notch job on. In fact, the Moodies had a great vocal blend-akin to the Beatles, Beach Boys and Hollies. Other things pop up-the three acoustic guitars in &quot;Are You Sitting Comfortably&quot;-it sounds like the 12 string is in the mix smack dab in the middle. Some of the flute sounds in &quot;The Voyage&quot; are produced from the mellotron-this is more pronounced in the &quot;This Is&quot; Cd. Also I like the jazz beat on &quot;So Deep Within You&quot;-in the mix there's a popping guitar riff.  I would like to see this CD redone with a remix just to hear some of the buried stuff-but I think I'll just have to be content with the tracks from &quot;This Is.&quot; All in all this CD really demonstrates the Moody Blues at their creative best with lots of musical surprises-the pedal steel effects from the mellotron on &quot;Send Me No Wine&quot;, the Kinks-like &quot;Lazy Day&quot; complete with a homey harmonica solo, and really nice extended flute solos on &quot;Dear Diary&quot; and &quot;Are You Sitting Comfortably&quot;
B000058T5E|3.0|I went out and bought this, because Jeff Beck has had a long line of good stuff over the years. I've only heard two of his other albums, &quot;Blow by Blow&quot; and &quot;Wired&quot;, so i'm not going to rate this disc based on how it compared to those. I will add that this disc is nowhere near the aforementioned. Jeff Beck, for one thing, is writing the material with different people than he did in the 70's (no more Max Middelton and umm...you know, Narada the drummer). No more funk, that's all back then, I understand this. What i'm hearing on this new album is a lot of 'dirty' slide guitar, samples, electronica, dub, house beats, etc. that a lot of the younger people like these days. Actually, i'd say it's not as big a deal as it was 5 years ago, but what do I know? The only 'techno' groups i'm familiar with are Orbital, Underworld, Aphex Twin, groups like that. You know what? They do this kind of music better than Beck!   Let me explain myself. The majority of this album is filled with guitar licks, sampled licks, electronic drums, drum loops galore, other sampled sounds. I did rather enjoy a bit of the music around the beginning and middle, although I was annoyed by how a lot of the music is repeated and sampled and looped, when it didn't really have to be. It comes across to me as an attempt to sound modern and hip, when it should have come across as something more honest and deep, at the least. There's some pretty good guitar playing here, it's what you'd kinda expect from JB. He plays a lot more bluesy than what i've heard of his work. He does some interesting stuff on &quot;Blackbird&quot;. Guitar-wise, it's good music, nothing that's 'wowing' or anything, but it works appropriately. The sound quality is very good, it would be good to listen to with headphones. I would listen to this just for that.     How would I rate this? Well, I can't help but be somewhat dissapointed. It's not surprising, all of the old wank guitarists are doing this techno-y stuff now. I did hear some music I liked rather well. &quot;Nadia&quot; is great listening. A lot of the other songs would have rated higher with me if they didn't have so much repetition that didn't work so well. Like I said, it sounds like an attempt to cash in on the modern sound, at least to my ears. Beck could have benefited from the work of someone from the world of technno that knows what they're doing. This music could benefit from a remix of sorts. The track with the woman singing was nice, but it didn't sound right with the Robert Johnson lyrics. Her voice is too gentle for imaging some gorgeous woman singing the blues and drinking whiskey all the time.    Well, i've really torn into this CD, huh? I just don't know what to think of it. I don't think it would grow on me, though. It's way too short, only about 36 minutes,.... Plus, it's 10 songs. How plain of a set up is that? And the songs are all 3 minutes long......so it sounds like rock/techno, but it's setup technically like punk? No thanks.    I give this a 75 percent. Go buy Joe Satriani &quot;Engines of Creation&quot; if you really want to hear music like this......but want more quality and quantity.
B00000JCB2|4.0|don't get me wrong. significant other is a great album, but the reason i took off a star was because this cd introduced them to the pop world. i am still a huge limp bizkit fan and like all 3 albums they've written, but they would be better if they weren't introduced into pop. just the other day, i was walkin' in a store and i saw a magazine. it waa some teen magazine. the fron page had pics og christian aguilera, britney spears, o town, and guess who...limp bizkit. i couldn't believe it. it pissed me off that they would even agree to be on the cover of a teen bopper magazine. but now, i'll get to the real poitn of my review...the songs. the songs that are great are just like this, nookie, break stuff, re-arranged, nobody like you, 9 teen 90 nine, n 2 gether now, and show me what you got. the songs that are just plain good are i'm broke, don't go off wandering, trust?, and no sex. so worthwhile, you should buy this cd if you are a fan of korn, limp bizkit of course, rage against the machine, and powerman 5000. buy this cd! but don't let it get you into britney spears! hahaha
0140177396|4.0|This book is one of the best books i have read. John Ernst Steinbeck must have been very proud of his book. This book charts the story of two itinerant farm labourers, named George &amp; Lennie. The way this book is constructed is excellent, and a guideline for any aspiring writer. The characters in this book are trapped in unfair circumstances, but still manage to remain heroic and sympathetic (if defeated). As they do this, they also manage to keep a sort of quiet dignity about themselves. It is an amazing study of lonliness and discrimination, and how this discrimination leads to lonliness for some of the characters. A true American classic.
0380729407|4.0|Ray Bradbury is one of the masters of modern literature.  However, I have only encountered his excellent prose twice: in the superb science fiction thriller FAHRENHEIT 451 (a must read) and here in the pages of SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES.  After these entertaining reads, I need to familiarize myself with more of his work.<br />As for the book, Something Wicked is a story that every child (especially young boys) can relate to.  It's the story of friendship and indeed best friends, the story of an evil carnival that gives people what they desire...but at what price, and the bond between fathers and sons.  Truly the monsters in this book practically leap off of the page - the dust witch really creeped me out.  The tattooed Mr. Dark is an evil classic and the confrontation between him and the main characters in the depths of the library is a page-burner (and made me remember the creepy feeling I used to get in librarys).<br />If you are not familiar with this story...READ IT NOW!  And, where this story cries out to the joys of youth and childhood, I feel I should also recommend BOY'S LIFE by Robert R. McCammon which in many ways is a reflection on this story...the two would definately make excellent book ends.
6305428271|4.0|this movie was great. it had great acting by the kids who played the students as well as michelle pfeiffer. i really liked this movie to the point where i own it on vhs and dvd. this movie is special because it was based on a school in my hometown.
B000002C2E|5.0|Dylan's best since OH MERCY and one of the best recordings of the entire decade of the 1990s.Its a summation of Dylans innate feel for the timeless nature of American music- the real stuff- the roots, the blues. But Dylan's approach to blues is not the copy stuff of current and past practitioners, its natural, unassuming and what else can you say- brilliant. The sound approaches one of those 50's Excello records, echoey and swamplike. Dylan's vocals immediately reminds one of Howlin' Wolf on these incredible blues tunes. Immediately accessible, these songs sound like they have been around for years. Also noted is Augie Meyers vintage Vox organ embellishments- &quot;Dirt Road&quot; has his stamp on it- very nice..Dylan was on a roll during these sessions as he was on &quot;Oh Mercy&quot; which produced out takes like &quot;Born In Time&quot;. &quot;Series of Dreams&quot; and &quot;Dignity&quot; which surfaced elsewhere. When Dylan recieved his Grammy he mentioned &quot;the other tracks&quot; which didn't make it on the album. I guess we have towait another ten years when this is reissued with &quot;bonus&quot; tracks.
B00004U8JU|5.0|Man this movie is intense. It is soo great. At the time, it had to be the best movie of the year. Spielberg really mad a classic out of that movie. Now it is an 8 year old movie. In the movie it shows how scientest fickle around with dino DNA, and frog DNA to create...Dinosaurs. It might seem as if everything is going right at firtst, but the senario of the movie is changed. The big turning point of this flick is when the power shuts down, and the dino's start exscaping. Not good. SO get up and go rent this and you will see that it is a wonderful movie. Also in 1998 ,i think, spielberg brought Jurasic Park back with &quot;The Lost World&quot; (a sequal to Jurasic Park). Now this movie wasn't nearly as awesome as the first. But it still was a good movie. Just the people actually new what they were up against, they were prepared, but in the first they were not as prepared and that is what makes it so intense. So go watch this and enjoy it.
B00000IP4H|2.0|It's hard to rate such an album. If its purpose is to be a good thrash metal album, than it gets five out of five stars. Noisy, furious and dumb, all thrash metal of this kind is meant to be. Because of that, all the 11 songs sound exactly the same. What is missing is some female vocals and violin parts here and there. Then at least this could be considered a pleasant listening... The way it is, far from that...
6305781427|2.0|When I first saw this concert, it was on the laser disc, and I thought it was incredible.  Two years later, I saw it again at a friend's house, and it was on VHS.  It also sounded incredible.  Then I was looking around in late 1999 for the DVD version, only to find out that if I want it, I need to buy the whole Yanni set.  Finally, around early 2000, I got a hold of the DVD version, and was not impressed.  The sound quality was poor, the video quality was also poor.  Needless to say, I ended up returning the disc.
B00000IAU3|5.0|Her voice is amazing.Those song are soft like: Thank you, My lover's gone etc.And the songs I like the most are Here with me, Don;t think of me,Thank you,All you and I'm no angel.It help you to relax!

B00004RFFI|5.0|O man this movie is soo good. I loved this movie. It might start out as seeming a little slow, but it turns out to be awesome. Some of the people are a little weird also, but i guess you have to be weird to chase tornadoes. If you want to see a awesome, good, action, scary movie then this is it. It shows how cool the storm chasers are when they do their stuff. You really need to see this. But the only problem with the movie is the twisters always seem to folow the storm chasers everywhere they go!
B00004X01U|5.0|&quot;Music&quot; is without a doubt, one of Madonna's best albums (Along with &quot;Like A Prayer&quot;, &quot;Erotica&quot;, and &quot;Ray of Light&quot;) she has ever recorded.  After listening to it over and over again, I can honestly say that I have not gotten tired of it at all.  The standout tracks on the album are &quot;Music&quot;, &quot;Impressive Instant&quot;, &quot;I Deserve It&quot;, &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot;, &quot;What It Feels Like For A Girl&quot;, and &quot;Gone&quot; (at least in my opinion).  The rest of the songs are really good too.  There is not a song on this album, that is actually bad.  This CD makes a great birthday/holiday gift.  If you don't own it already...BUY IT!
B000005JXG|5.0|What more needs to be said? This is not only the greatest Pogues/MacGowan album, it is the greatest album ever recorded. &quot;Bottle of Smoke&quot;, &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot;, &quot;South Australia.&quot; The best songs for all moods are on this album.  Buy it without a second thought.
044651652X|5.0|I recall when the thought of this story was revolting and the last story I ever wanted to read or view.  But then...  I was married, away from my spouse for a year and doing well at behaving.  Then it happened.  I met someone and began a relationship with the type of passion featured in this book.  I don't know where it came from, but it struck me like a train.  During this time, I watched the movie with her and cried.  I don't cry, so this was a powerful story to say the least.  Maybe because I was involved in similar situations that were featured.  Later I read the book and was pleased to cry again.  I read the book again, and cried, again.  It is a great novel and I am pleased to know that someone else (the author) was able to understand what I was feeling.  With matters of the heart, there is no trying to understand.  Stories like this allow us to relish the pleasure we have felt, experience the torture of having something we can't have and wish Francesca would have opened the f*&amp;%ing door to her truck!
B000002UJQ|4.0|I bought &quot;OK Computer&quot; a few weeks after its release. During those few weeks I heard critics and fans alike hailing it as  the best album of the nineties, if not the best album of all time. &quot;This should be worth a listen, then&quot;, I thought to myself. After all, I heard numerous tracks from their previous album &quot;The Bends&quot; on the radio and liked them (especially &quot;High And Dry). When I first played OK Computer, the first six tracks blew me away instantly. &quot;Airbag&quot; is tuneful and fresh-sounding with its drum loop and string arrangement. &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; is like a &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; for the 1990's, and definitely one of that decade's best singles. &quot;Exit Music&quot; is another great song. It has this folksy quality to it, which I like. &quot;Let Down&quot; and &quot;Subterranean Homesick Alien&quot; are nice mellow guitar-pop tunes. &quot;Karma Police&quot; is the track that first caught my attention. I really enjoyed it on the first few listenings, but thanks to it being thrashed on radio and MTV (and other music channels for that matter), it doesn't really hold any special interest for me anymore. <br />I could've done without the rest of the album. &quot;Fitter Happier&quot; is a joke. &quot;Electioneering&quot; is tuneless drivel. &quot;No Surprises&quot; is mildly tuneful, but after a while it becomes just plain annoying with its repetitive xylophone riff, and all the radio overplay just makes the song sound worse (the video for this song is one of the worst I've seen. What statement is Thom trying to make here?). &quot;Lucky&quot; and &quot;The Tourist&quot; are completely dull and uninteresting. &quot;Climbing Up The Walls&quot; is the only really good song amongst this clunker. It has this spooky atmosphere and the string arrangement benefits the song 100%.<br />So, all in all, this is the kind of album one would buy in order to sound &quot;cool&quot; or &quot;intelligent&quot; in front of his/her peers. &quot;OK Computer&quot; would've worked better for me if it were a 6-song EP encompassing the first six songs of the album. I still can't come to grips with the fact that the British &quot;Q&quot; magazine ranked this album as the second best British album of all time ahead of much better albums by artists such as the Beatles, the Smiths and David Bowie. &quot;OK Computer&quot; might have been one of the best British albums of the nineties, but certainly not the second best of all time! I though &quot;Q&quot; would've known better. The album still gets four stars because the first half of the album is superb. So what is the best album of all time? I'm not too sure right now, as I have many favourites, but it is certainly NOT Radiohead's &quot;OK Computer&quot;.
6305807043|3.0|To my mind, the desperate thirst for something original and fresh that has parched the metaphorical throats of so many film viewers of the 90s and beyond, is the chief thing that has compelled so many to proclaim this a &quot;masterpiece.&quot; What it really is, is a daring but ultimately mediocre black comedy which tries to be too many things at once.<br />The premise has charm, it's true. John Malkovich couldn't have been a better choice for an oddball film like this, and he is the one actor involved who I feel I can give real, enduring credit to. He throws himself into the project without a trace of self-consciousness, going wherever the movie asks him to, having fun, and tackling tricky territory at the same time (it can't be easy to pretend that you're partially possessed by a dorky John Cusack, but Malkovich does it well -- probably playing Cusack's part better than Cusack himself does.) <br />Other than this, and the sheer volume of quirkiness that many seem to enjoy, Being John Malkovich is pretty weak. All of the major characters are unlikable and annoying, and only occasionally funny. I assume they are supposed to annoying -- to reflect our own imperfections, somewhat uncomfortably -- but I just didn't care for this tactic. It's awkwardly done. It isn't even exactly &quot;black comedy,&quot; unless black comedy is characterized primarily by awkward, schizophrenic, arbitrary jerks in tone and mood. <br />Feeling no affinity for the characters and being only marginally interested in the outcome of their highly unpredictable activities, it was hard to view their general descent into mutual abuse and emotional greed with much more than puzzled distaste. The metaphysical themes played up on towards the end are interesting in and of themselves, but, like almost everything else in Being John Malkovich, are melded into the overall project in a generally unsatisfactory fashion. The film will just decide: &quot;It's time to be serious and deep now,&quot; and that'sthat. Like the raining frogs in Magnolia, Being John Malkovich is full of strange turns that, though bold and original, are more contrived than earned. <br />As far as performances go, it's pretty much Malkovich's show. John Cusack's performance, although his character has a few funny moments, is irritatingly bad. Cameron Diaz fares better as his dowdy, animal-loving wife -- unfortunately, the character herself isn't very interesting or funny. Catherine Keener just acts bitchy and weird, as usual, and the fact that she happens to be the &quot;femme fatale&quot; here is kind of arbitrary. <br />Kudos to Charlie Sheen on a great cameo though. One of the best parts of this otherwise interesting but overrated film.
B00000APLB|3.0|This live album chronicles the Stones at probably the low point of their career. Ron Wood was still becoming integrated in the band, Keith Richards was hitting rock bottom, and Mick Jagger was trying to keep the band together. The song tempos give the listener an idea of what kind of substances the players must have been ingesting before, after, and even during the shows. Having said that, this is a better live album than a lot that I have heard. The only double live album the Rolling Stones have done (all of their live albums should have been doubles!)

B00000IPAX|2.0|I'm not sure when exactly when it happened, but this once great punk band is now definitely a designed-for-MTV pop sellout. With the exception of 3 songs, this album is completely pop. Let's take a look at the 30-minute album song-by-song:<br />1. Dumpweed-Your classic 1-riff, then 3-chord progression, then interlude with a slow riff, then 3-chord progression a few more times, completely generic pop/punk song. Nothing original about it.<br />2. Don't Leave Me- See above.<br />3. Aliens Exist- Mildly entertaining at first, but not a punk song.<br />4. Going Away to College- Maybe their slowest song ever, and that's not a good thing.<br />5. What's My Age Again- Their first single off the album, this song is yet another generic punk-inspired pop song.<br />6. Dysentery Gary- This song is one of those songs that they do when they're trying to be funnier than they really are.<br />7. Adam's Song- I respect and admire the song's intent, but it's just another pop song.<br />8. All the Small Things- An average, maybe above-average song, but the &quot;NA-NA-NA&quot; part gets really annoying after about 3 plays.<br />9. The Party Song- One of the 3 good songs on the album, and definitely the only real punk song.<br />10. Mutt- This is just a dumb song.<br />11. Wendy Clear- A very good, catchy song, even if it is kind of a pop song.<br />12. Anthem- The album's best song<br />So, there you have it. If you're under-12, or don't mind the pop influences, you may be satisfied. But if you're a die-hard punk fan (like me) or loved the other Blink CD's (like me), 3 quality songs just doesn't cut it.
B0000025KI|5.0|&quot;The River&quot; is an album for every Springsteen fan.  While it may not adhere to the epic content of &quot;Born to Run,&quot; it is by far my favorite of his albums.  It has a bit of fun-time music like &quot;Cadillac Ranch&quot; for the rockers, classic blue-collar ballads like &quot;Point Blank,&quot; and Springsteen genius like &quot;The River.&quot;  This is an album you can dance to, drive to and sit back and smoke to.  It makes you want to sit with the lights off in a dim room, drink a beer, and smoke a cigarette.  Woe to the fool who interrupts you.  Or maybe you'll just get in the car and drive, drive, drive, letting The Boss take you away.   While many may not recognize the value of Springsteen's balladic hits off albums such as &quot;Nebraska&quot; and &quot;The Ghost of Tom Joad,&quot; one has to accept the calm intensity of &quot;The River.&quot;  He weaves these simple hits into the album as if to warn the rockers of the real reason he's making music.  Time has shown us that not everyone can feel the glory of his reality. Those of us who can value the simplicity and rebelliousness of smoking a cigarette will remain true fans of the true spirit of &quot;The River.&quot;   &quot;..her body tan and wet down at the reservoir...&quot;    .....it's a haunting way of making music.
B00003CXE7|5.0|I saw Gladiator the day it opened in theaters, and the second I came out of the theater I knew that it was the Best Picture of 2000, and it's certainly proved itself to be. Since that first viewing, I have seen it about 200 more times, and it only gets better with age. If you don't see it for the plot, direction, or Crowe's fantastic acting, see it for Joacquim Phoenix's brilliant breakout portrayal of the scheming Commodus. GLADIATOR IS THE BEST FILM OF 2000!

0553278223|5.0|Well, first of all, I must say, this book is one of the first books I ordered from Amazon.com. I finished it in one day. Ray Bradbury is one of the best writers of the century! I really loved the different points of view in the book (the native-martian, the first settlers, etc) and I thought the descriptions of views and the author's imagination are simply amazing. However, the thing I liked the most was also the one that bothered me,it was hard for me to get used to a different point of view every few pages... The problem is that there's no main character that exists through all the stories. Each time a new story begins I have to &quot;re-adjust&quot; myself for a new main character with new background and new everything... It was hard but after a while I got used to it and had a blast reading this awesome book.
0156252856|5.0|If you ask me about my favorite book, the book that I would take to a lonely island, the book that I would recommend everyone to read: Here is it. I read Saint-Exupery's wondrous story of the little prince in the German translation, but translations cannot harm this wonderful, poetic book and cannot hide the deep thoughts that are expressed in this simple language that makes it sound like a book for children.<br />Le petite prince is not really a typical text of Saint-Exupery's. He was famous for his activities as a pilot (which presumably ended his life during WWII) and has written several books about this. There are also a few very complex texts (like &quot;Citadelle&quot; which I haven't managed to read completely), and then there is this strange book, which is for kids and not for kids, which contains so much wisdom and ongoing astonishment about the world around us.<br />The little prince lives on a very (extremely) small planet nearby with his vulcanoes and his flower. On his tour arond the solar system he meets many different people (kings, merchants, ...) until he finally meets with the author who had an emergency landing somewhere in the desert on Earth.<br />Read this - in what language ever - and be charmed by the little prince!

B000002BFZ|5.0|It seems with every Pearl Jam album the band grows more mature and versitile. This can best be proven by No Code. This is completly different from their previous album, the dark and powerful, Vitalogy. This album has a perfect blend of hard riveting songs like &quot;Habit&quot;, &quot;Hail,Hail&quot; and &quot;Lukin&quot;. These are all hardcore songs that will not dissapoint fans (I really wish &quot;Lukin&quot; was longer though, because it is so cool!!!). It also has great slow songs that work very well at making you think. &quot;Off he goes&quot; and &quot;Present Tense&quot; are proof as this. &quot;Smile&quot; is a great song that is really unique mix of blues and great lyrics(the harmonica is a nice touch as well). &quot;Mankind&quot; is a interesting song, with vocals by Stone Gossard. This is a complete pop song, (it seems only rock bands can pull off a good pop song) but all in all is pretty decent. &quot;In My Tree&quot; has a great meaning to me and and is one of my fav's on the album. &quot;I'm Open&quot; and &quot;Around the Bend&quot; are the last two songs and really should have been left out. They are not good at all. All together this album is worth its price and is very underrated, I think. Maybe only hardcore PJ fans enjoy this piece of artwork.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This movie is simply... PERFECT. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix are oscar winners. This is rhe kind of movies you must see more than once. The more I see it the more I like it. The movie makes sense since the VERY BEGINNING till the end. The music is superbly heartfelt.This movie must be categorized as the best 21st Century Classic.
0380788624|5.0|OK, read &quot;Snow Crash&quot; or &quot;Diamond Age&quot; if you're into that sort of thing.  Stephenson did a pretty good job of writing two half-books, but in each case wandered off into the kind of goofy arcane mysticism that was part of the formula in a lot of '70s/'80s science fiction.  <br />&quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; is another book entirely.  I don't know what you read for, but in fiction I look for complex plot, serious treatment of interesting technology, in-depth characterization of unusual people the author makes me care about, and a joy of craft.  Stephenson knows cryptography (he's written a non-fiction book on it) and computing (another book, on operating systems); part of what this book is about is the early-'40s roots and the right-now flowering of both disciplines.  He buries those four strands in parallel narratives of a grandfather and grandson who are both of a type that I recognize: seriously smart people who (when they think of it) have to work to be aware of the social life that surrounds them.  One of Stephenson's achievements is that he gets into the heads of both of these people, giving the reader a sympathetic and recognizably geek-eye view of the world.   Oh, yeah, there's also a sympathetic portrayal of a Marine sergeant who's a bit of a geek, himself: his attitude towards the social arts is best summed up on one of his lines: &quot;Sir, no sir! But I do detect a strong odor of politics in the room now, sir!&quot;<br />As to joy of craft, the guy's writing is somewhere between Dave Barry and Hunter Thompson -- embedded in the book are long riffs that further the story or deepen the characterization but that could stand on their own as examples of pure creative &quot;I'm doing this because I can&quot; story-telling.  The tale of Randy's wisdom teeth is a perfect example -- read from page 776 through to the kicker sentence at the bottom of page 779 and you'll get a new perspective on Randy (the grandson), oral surgeons, and Stephenson.<br/>Well worth the read.

Then there was 1% of the people who said they hated it. And saying things like &quot;are we all listening to the same cd.&quot; I didnt understand that and that is why im writing this review. I will addmit that when my friend first told me of this group Nickelback I went home from school and downloaded some of there music and HATED it. I almost agreed with the one star people. Just for fun I downloaded more and more songs from them. I stared to like them ALOT more. Well ill get to the point. I went to my local music store and i bought the cd. At the time i bought it i was a big fan. I listend through the cd and i thought it was good. I listened to it again and again and everytime i hear something new that i really like and it makes me want to listen to it again. Somedays i listen to this cd 2-4 times. This normally isnt my kind of music. Yeah i like creed and some rock bands but im a bigger fan of music such as godsmack, system of a down and that type. But i have to say that Nickelback is eithier my first or second favorie band of all time.<br />You want this cd it is GREAT..BUY BUY BUY....Im sure you wont regret it. It if you read my entire reveiw thank you. I know i drug it out and its  kinda long. Please make sure you say if it was helpful or not. Id like to see if people agree with me.
0805062971|5.0|Jack is your average white-collar consumerist American. He goes to work everyday so he can buy crap that he doesn't need, in order to increase his social status. He has trouble sleeping, he feels as if something is missing in his life.<BR> One day he meets Tyler Durden. Tyler is the incarnation of MacGuyver if only he had been working for the bad guys. He could make a bomb out of an orange juice carton if he had to. Tyler and Jack end up starting a ring of underground boxing clubs filled with people trying to fill the void in their lives through acts of self-destruction and terrorism. Everyone, I mean EVERYONE, is in on Fight Club.<BR> As things progress, &quot;Project Mayhem&quot; begins to spin out of control and Jack makes a startling discovery about his relationship to Tyler.<BR> &quot;Fight Club&quot; is a well-needed foray into nilihistic philosophies, a no-holds-barred look at who we are in this faceless consumerist society. Its concepts will shock you, but as you read you may very well find yourself nodding your head in agreement on some other level. The subjects in this book are ripe for discussion.
B00003CXFG|5.0|This is not only a perfect horror movie, it is character development of the highest caliber. The two main people are an escaped killer being returned to prison (Vin Diesel) and a spunky officer who becomes captain only because she is the highest ranking officer left alive (Radha Mitchell).  The unique qualities that make them both heroes is revealed as the power of humanity.<br />Imagine sleeping in a stasis chamber, similar to being in a coma, except the body doesn't age.  You are there for a long voyage -- as if you were sleeping on the Titanic in a cargo hold.  The spaceship is pummeled by asteroid fragments that kill most of the crew and passengers as they batter the ship.  Fortunately alarms are set to awaken the crew who immediately begin trying to save the vessel.<br />One of the options for the very skillful pilot is to jettison the sleeping pods; if the load is lightened they might be able to save themselves. After crash landing, Mitchell's decision haunts her as she and a small group of survivors try to find a way off a strange and deadly world.<br />Consider yourself to be on an arid desert with three suns and very little water ...  in a region where there is no darkness to shade the sunlight ... a place where a science expedition landed years before, but no one is left alive ...  a small planet that experiences a total eclipse of all three suns once every twenty-two years.<br />It is nearly time for the eclipse, and it is in the Pitch Black that the horror emerges -- creatures who live and breed in the darkness. How long does a total eclipse last when three suns are blocked by shadows?<br />In the best tradition of suspense, the secrets are slowly revealed. When you do learn what is killing the survivors one by one and causing them to battle among themselves, you may find yourself turning on a few more lights.<br />The development of the characters that is finally revealed at the end is stunning. The phrase that comes to my mind is:  ...in order to save your life, you have to lose it ...<br />Five stars all the way.er to save your life, you have to lose it ...<br />Five stars all the way.

B0000203YT|5.0|Wow. This is a truly remarkable film. The plot is sweet, light, and touching. While the introduction into the movie first moves slowly, in only a short amount of time, the unique and warming love story will touch everybody. It also raises the question of who Shakespeare really was and what kind of private and love life he led, being that he wrote so many incredible poems to express love. The picture and plot are great, but another large factor in this movie that cannot be forgotten is the soundtrack. Light, flowing, fluffy... awesome. This movie is a must see and must have for all:)

0784011680|5.0|Robert Downey Jr. (known as Larry on Ally MacBeal) is a natural genius of an actor who becomes Charles Chaplin in this classic movie.  (Downey was nominated for Best Actor (he was robbed)  Charlie Chaplins life was complicated and controversal at the least.  Being remembered in front of the camera is his legacy ( The AFI (American Film Institute) voted 3 of his movies; Gold Rush 1925, City Lights 1931 &amp; Modern Times 1936 into the Best 100 Movies in the Last 100 Years in 1998).  His private life outside of making movies was his vulnerable side. <br />This movie shared with us his career and genius of the man known as the &quot;Little Tramp.  So buy this movie (a great value almost 3 hours long) and learn about the most famous silent screen star &quot;Charlie Chaplin&quot; brillantly played by Downey.  As a treat Geraldine Chaplin (Charlie Chaplin's daughter) plays Charlies mother in the movie.

B00004WG2X|4.0|If you are a Jane Austen fan, you'll probably enjoy having this production in your collection.  It's biggest detraction is that it is not A&amp;E's P&amp;P, and if you love that one, you may find yourself comparing the two with this one suffering by such comparison.  <br />So setting aside A&amp;E's version, the dialogue on this one is wonderful, very true to the book (with a few exceptions).  However, the acting is sometimes stiff and awkward, and at times the movie suffers from over-acting, with the exception of Lizzie (played by Garvie).  <br />The costumes, settings and music are wonderful.  Mrs. Bennett is true to the book, but I found Mr. Bennett portrayed worse than he should have been.  There was little to like about him in this movie (he is one of my favorite characters in the book), and his lines are delivered with nastiness and little wit.  Fortunately he makes only a few appearances.<br />Charlotte is given the role as Lizzie's confidante, which should be Jane, who is reduced to a very shallow, peripheral character.  Mr. Collins is wonderfully silly, but Wickham and the rest of the Bennett sisters are not well-developed.<br />If you've seen the other BBC Austen productions from the 80's you will enjoy seeing some of your old &quot;friends.&quot;  Charlotte is played by &quot;Elinor&quot; from the BBC production of &quot;Sense &amp; Sensibility.&quot;  Julia from BBC's &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; plays Miss Bingley very well.
B000002BFL|5.0|The first time I bought this I hated it so much I sold it to a used CD store. I thought it was dull and depressing and it was an example of an aging rock star going through a serious mid-life crisis. Then I saw Springsteen for the umpteenth time at Madison Square Garden and heard him do some of this material live. I went out and gave Tom Joad another try and now it's one of my favorite Springsteen albums. Personally, I find it more meaningful than Nebraska. I think there's more anger and more hope in the songs, which are reminiscent of early Guthrie or even Leadbelly. Was especially impressed by the last song, &quot;my best was never good enough.&quot; Granted, I can see that this album is something of an acquired taste, but if you're willing to stick with it and really hear the lyrics, this is possibly Springsteen's best.

0783225733|5.0|There are many good reviews already here of the movie itself, which was already my favorite (There's just not that many movies where engineers in dorky glasses get to be heroes!).  I want to tell you about the DVD version.  I just got a DVD player, and this was the first one I bought. The movie itself deserves 5 stars, but what really puts this version over the top is the commentary by Jim Lovell and his wife.<br />If you haven't seen the movie before, watch it a few times first, because you won't be able to hear the dialog over the comments. Then, when you know the story, turn on Jim's comments. He and his wife have interesting things to say about every scene in the movie. If you like space, engineering, or if your spouse has ever been in the military, you will be fascinated by their tale that was just as dramatic in real life as the movie version. I was amazed at how many things were actually true and not just made up to improve the story.<br />This is a true collector's item that I will make my kids and grandkids watch.
B000002JSV|5.0|Absolutely AC/DC's finest moment. No &quot;hit&quot; to speak of, but this was from the grand old days when radio played good music instead of popular music. Not a clunker in the bunch.I suggest you drive across the desert in a convertible with this one scaring the critters off the road. This album once lived in my car tape deck for an entire summer.
B00000BKDY|5.0|I first got into Maiden by listening to their latest effort, Brave New World, which, I believe is one of the best albums to come out within the las year. So I decided to listen to their earlier stuff as well the way I did with Metallica. I bought this album right before Christmas and it blew me away. This album had everything. Power, speed and soul. It stayed in my cd player for a good while. I just could not get enough of any of the songs. The synths add tones and textures to the songs that make me shiver with delight and when it comes to guitar duos, Adrian Smith and Dave Murray are the greatest to ever walk the Earth. Adrian's solos in Caught Somewhere in Time make me throw my head back and laugh with delight as they ascend and descend left and right. No should be that good! Nicko pounding on the drums makes my blood race. Bruce Dickinson reaches a new level of power on this album as well as his operatic voice pushes each song to new heights. The one track that just totally blows me away though, is Alexander the Great. If every album has a masterpiece, then this is it. Adrian totally out does himself on this one and proves that he is a guitar god (although he did that over the course of the whole album). Steve Harris once again proves that he is a master of the base with galloping rhythms that provide the foundation for each song. This album is tied with Powerslave and for best ever. So if you have some time to lose buy this album that will amaze you for all time.
B000003BES|4.0|I was dissapointed to hear the organ version of TIME IS ON MY SIDE instead of the better and far more supperior guitar version. Everything else is great though. Most of these great songs are carried onto HOT ROCKS 1964-71, ROLLING STONES. I highly recommend that album as of highest priority. It has SATISFACTION, GET OFF MY CLOUD, PLAY WITH FIRE, HONKY TONK WOMEN, SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL, and more.
B000000I0I|5.0|Which is best? TUBULAR BELLS, HERGEST RIDGE or OMMADAWN?  I could make a case for any of them.  There is plenty of debate in these...reviews about their respective merits, but frankly it's like arguing over which is the most important bird species.<br />The simple fact is that you need to own all three albums.  There are many who believe that Oldfield was put on this Earth to make OMMADAWN.  If Oldfield had disappeared completely from the music scene after recording OMMADAWN, then his place in history would have been assured.  Without this trilogy of albums, there would have been no market for the likes of Andreas Vollenweider, and a much smaller audience for composers as diverse as Tangerine Dream, Steve Reich, Arvo Part and even late Jan Garbarek.<br />With TUBULAR BELLS, Mike Oldfield opened up what would be known as New age music to a mass audience.  With OMMADAWN, he sealed his place in music legend, and perhaps unwittingly discovered a new audience by composing a suite of melodies with immense appeal to children.  Some time after this, Oldfield was hired to re-work the theme tune to the BBC children's programme, BLUE PETER.<br />OMMADAWN represented a departure from his previous solo, multi-tracked recording technique.  Other musicians were involved, not just in the recording but in the composition and arrangement too.  Influences from the folk music of Ireland, Africa and Eastern Europe can be clearly heard.  Paddy Moloney of the Irish band the Chieftains contributed the distinctive uillean pipes.  It was way ahead of its time, and for me, it confirms the 22-year-old Oldfield as not just one of the great classical guitarists in rock, but as one of its greatest composers.<br />Everyone peaks at some point in their life, and Oldfield did it between the ages of 19 and 22.  What sort of a life can you lead thereafter?  Oldfield has enjoyed his wealth and tried to recapture the glory of his prodigious musical achievement, but not with total success.<br />OMMADAWN is Oldfield at his peak.  The 1970s provided the nurturing environment needed to create this extraordinary recording.  We are unlikely to witness either again.DAWN is Oldfield at his peak.

B00000IQC8|5.0|There is no point in renting this film, you will want to own it.  This is the funniest film of all time.  Kevin Smith has done more for indie films than anyone (including Parker Posey) and is at his best with a shoe string budget.  The fact that hundreds of millions are spent on some of the worst films I have ever seen is made even more horrible when you compare that to how great a film can be with a well written script and some actors who seem to enjoy their job and are comfortable with their charactors.  This is the first installment of some of the best films made....
0679722610|5.0|Hammett's Red Harvest is probably the most devastatingly brutal good novel you'll ever read. It's not like slasher movies -- all blood and gore and no content. It's a book about brutal people, both gangsters and politicians, who will do anything to keep their hands on the power that they've managed to get hold of. The Continental Op, Hamett's anonymous detective, finds that the only way to clean up Personville is to join the fray, and though his conscience bothers him, he fights fire with fire and matches the scummy crooks machiavellian move to machiavellian move. What makes the book tick is precisely the bleak, realistic, nihilism of its main characters, who remind one so much of real politicians and crooks, but without any of the spin-doctor sheen that covers their tracks in the media. Red Harvest is a book I read every couple of years to marvel again at fantastic writing and the no-nonsense view of humanity's common, unadorned, ugliness.
B00004XMS0|3.0|Batman and Batman Returns are incredible.  Batman sets the perfect environment for the comic book to come to life.  Batman Returns is pure eye candy with it's increidlbe visuals.  The snow is a great contrast that expands on the look and feel of the original in a way that I would have though impossible.  Tim Burton is one of the best directors ever.  He makes every film his own and always adds something that lasts forever in your mind.<br />Joel Schumaker is horrible!  It should be illegal for him to get behind any camera, even one of those cheap disposable Kodak ones.  He does to these films what airlines do to food!  What was he thinking?  I can understand him wanting to add to these films and make them more his own, but why just make them stupid and silly?  Now I also think people blame the wrong person for the last film.  I happen to think George Clooney was a good Batman. I think he does a better job being Bruce Wayne than Batman, but still pretty good.  No one will match the comic wit and likability of Keaton, but Cloney was ten times better than Kilmer.  Kilmer made it unbearable to watch.  The villians are great in the first two, but they lose something in the last two, I think it's called direction.  What a waste of Thurman's and Carrey's talent!  Under Burton they would have been incredible.<br />I would like to wrap this up with a plea to both Burton and Schumaker.  Mr. Burton, make one more of these and fix this mess.  Kill Batman off in the end if you like, just do us all a favor and talk to Keaton and Pfifer and make at least one more.  Mr. Schumaker, please retire.  Do not touch any more superhero movies and try to leave good stars alone.  I mean what you did to Cage and Phoenix in 35mm is horrible.  Why the red light district in LA?  LA is a red light district, you idiot!  Your talent has always been over rated and now you just make people not like you.  Please stop!
0064400557|5.0|I recently bought Charlotte's Web because I'm planning to write a children's book and wanted to get an idea of what sort of language would be acceptable at this level. Well, all I can say is that the writing is pure, brisk, fast-moving and beautiful, and that it carries the story of Wilbur, Fern and Charlotte with the effortless brilliance that simply cannot be taught. The innocence of the story, with its bucolic farm setting and old-time values, is a marvelous vehicle for a story that deals with friendship, death, loss, and change in a manner more interesting than in many of the adult books that purport to take them as their object. I was not only touched and gratified by the writing, but also by the story itself, which was honest and brave in presenting the things that are the stuff of life, but without any of the preaching, lecturing or patronizing PC nonsense that so horribly afflicts children's writing today. White's book is for people who want their children to read chldren's literature, not some throw-away lecture about &quot;tolerance,&quot; and I recommend it without reservation. I'm amazed that I never read it as a child, but it was one of the best reads I've had in some time, even as I approach 40.
B00003CWOL|5.0|Kevin Smith has made some of the funniest movies out there.  The best part (with the exception of Randell from Clerks) has always been Jay and Silent Bob.  These two are worth watching in almost anything.  If you have not seen Dogma, check it out.  If you have not seen Clerks, order it now.  There is no point in renting it, you will want to own it!  Kevin Smith is one of the best talents working in film today.
B000056N8X|5.0|this is the best highlaneder film sinch the original and if you even saw the film when an immortal stops fighting they are no longer in the game so hence they lose by default so that explains that and i think it was just lovely a lovely film! 5 stars
0800179501|5.0|This is a great movie from the 80's.  The rest of the series is not that great, but that doesn't distract from the quality of the original.  This is a great film for kids who are interested in seeing what Karate should mean to them and when it's important to stand up for yourself, more importantly how.  The rest of the series is truly horrible.  Ralph Machio gets on your nerves after a more than an hour of viewing.  To be honest, I only like the rest (especially part 3) when they beat him up.
B000002ADT|5.0|This collection carries well-deserved accolades as the premium expression of the American  jazz idiom.  Miles Davis was the unquestioned giant of jazz, reaching heights of performance  quality unmatched by his contemporaries and unsurpassed since.  His pre-eminence stems  from an aspect of his delivery rarely discussed, but surely present.  Where the earlier forms of  jazz too often reflected &quot;bistro&quot; origins derived from Harlem, Paris or Kansas City, Davis  added a new element to this musical form.  In clubs, some fine improvisation took place,  giving jazz the &quot;life&quot; that made it so attractive.  Davis went a step further, bringing a level of  musical discipline to his compositions and interpretations that set him apart from his  predecessors and contemporaries.  This album is the finest expression of that additional step  he took in offering us the pinnacle of jazz performances.<br />It is difficult to envision what it's like for someone in today's generation to comprehend the  value of this CD.  Over forty years have passed since the original release with many new  forms of music introduced.  Yet the impact of Miles on modern music cannot be overstated.  Surely it's an indication of his accomplishments that this album brought together such giant  figures as Adderly, Coltrane and Evans.  They were big names when this album was made,  but were boosted by the increased knowledge of their talents as this album gained increased  recognition.  To hear it again, however, is far more than simply an historical journey.  It's a  pilgrimage to some of the most valuable music to emerge from the last century.  That it  remains readily available is full testimony of its value.  We can rejoice that Miles' reputation  and the attention given Kind of Blue over the years has led to a production quality that almost  matches the music and performer offering it to us.  Keep this music alive.  Buy it and pass it to  your children.  They will thank you in their hearts.hearts.
B00004T9UH|5.0|Ya, i really like the c.d and just ordered it a couple minutes ago. I don't think that it is really neccesary for there to be all of the sweares in it. I will not listen to that kindof music and listen to the edited version. If he is so unhappy than he should'nt be singing. I think that he is so incredably hot and i love him and think of him all the time. I love slim shady!!!his eyes are so pretty and want him all to my self.
B0002O7XW2|5.0|This film will be effective and pungent forever. We can regret the reduced presence of old rock and roll music in the film, as compared to the novel. We can regret the absence of the pregnant theme of Arnold's being haunted by the car to the point of the car getting him away from the crime scene when necessary. Then the ending is a lot less pathetic, poignant and powerful. It is even slightly weak. But the film as a whole is a masterpiece. A masterpiece about these teenagers and their only interests in life, the car and the girl they possess, want to possess or aspire to possess, just like they drink beer, out of spite. But it is always a question of possession. King inverts the direction of this fatal element and the owner is possessed by his own piece of property. The depicting of the possessive and tyrannical parents is superb. The magic of the car is beautiful. The bullies and the way they are treated all along and the way they are reduced to trashing a car and defecating on its dashboard is absolutely pitiless and treats them just the way they should and must be treated: like trash. We find it a good positive thing that these worth-nothing individuals are crashed and crushed and exploded and burnt to death by the car they have dared insult and trash themselves. Vengeance has such a sweet taste to the virginal tongue of a teenager who still thinks his tongue is done to lick ice-cream cones. There is little more to say about it except that it is obvious adults are giving little damn about teenagers. The film only has five adults. The parents who are aggressively possessive. The workshop teacher who is absent when he should not be and then violent when he should have prevented it by being in his place at the right time: that is called duty. Then Darnell who is suspicious, hostile, greedy, rotten and corrupt, and yet impotent in front of such a miracle: a teenager kept on a leash by a magical car. Finally the inspector did not understand anything, or rather, if he understood anything, did not do what he should have done: put Arnie and his car under surveillance, and even the car in custody, not to say in prison. He let the criminal and its accessory free to go on killing. And that was a state cop, from the State of California. That's what I call a respectable body of the security forces of our modern world. Yet I do prefer the book, even if John Carpenter avoided the pink color of the bulldozer which is in the film a pink kaka-eater. Plain yellow is more visually realistic. A pink bulldozer sounds like a pink panther.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGIDunderstood anything, did not do what he should have done: put Arnie and his car under surveillance, and even the car in custody, not to say in prison.

B000002N25|5.0|This cd is wonderful, though most of the tracks could be mistaken for Dire Straits songs (which is never a bad thing), some of the songs break out of that mold and create a truley original sound (darling pretty, je suis desole and others), more apparent in &quot;Sailing to Philadelphia&quot;, Knopfler's second solo album.
B00000IPAX|4.0|I had this album for awhile now but I dident think about writing a reveiw for it till now.Let me just start off saying that I dident think much of Blink before this album.I just thought they were another band that was trying to get on MTV.But since I kept replaying &quot;Dammit&quot; on my &quot;Can't Hardly Wait&quot;soundtrack I thought I should give them a try.And I have to say I wasent dissapointed.Usually when I first buy a CD I pop it in my Discman and skip around the songs going to the ones I know are good and sampling the others.Well when I put this one in I was never tempted to press the skip button at all.The melody's of the songs were always differant but were always great.I thought Blink was suposed to me more punk rock but I found this CD punk/pop/alternetive.It was a mix of those styles.My favorite song was and still is &quot;Aliens Exist&quot;,its not even the best song on the album it just I like UFOs and stuff,ya know.Whatever,&quot;Adams's Song&quot;is about anti-suicide,it is a pretty cool song.All of the songs are pretty good.There not the best in the world but very good for the MTV generation.I have no idea what Im talking about so Ill shut up now.Just go buy this album!
B000001EAQ|5.0|I'm so tired of former U2 fans whining about U2's experiments in electronica in the 90's. They act as if the band should have kept remaking the JOSHUA TREE over and over and never try to reinvent or challenge themselves as a group. U2's albums in the 90's were some of the decade's finest, and POP is no exception. I have little doubt that Radiohead would have had the courage to put out an album like Kid A had it not been for Pop. Of course Pop was not such a radical departure for U2 (following Passengers vol.1, Zooropa &amp; Achtung Baby) that Kid A was for Radiohead, but it was still a brave new album at the time. For example, I think &quot;discoteque&quot; was almost unrecognizable as a U2 track when it came out, and that is what is so brilliant about it. These guys are blowing their own minds. Good for them. As for the other songs, taken together the overall production may seem a bit pretensious, uneven and over done. However, taken individually, the songs stand on their own as some of the best songs of a decade. If one takes a listen to the top songs of 1999, it all sounds like a mixed pop culture package. It sounds a lot like Pop -just two years ahead of it's time.
6305972591|4.0|Many fans and critics of the horror gene has given the children of the corn films a bad reputation. But, ignore them and focus on the film itself and what you think of it. There is six children of the corn films in the sereis, leaving no room for a  seventh at the end of the sixth film (CHILDREN OF THE CORN 666 ISAACS RETURN). If you read the book Night Shift, Children Of The Corn is orgianlly a short story that was written by Stephen King. Of course, the book is completely different from the movie. The movie has a good ending while the book does not. There is features on this film [Amazon.com] just didn't put it in. There is a theatrical trailer, 5X7 theatrical poster, 16 page collector's booklet, dolby digital 5.1, and widescreen 1.85:1 (ANAMORPHIC). The first children of the corn film that was released to dvd was Children Of The Corn 666 Isaac's Return which had no features. This film is a good and entertaining  campy film that lives up to the title. Anchor Bay did do a good<br />job on doing it. So if you own a dvd player and a VHS copy of the film then get rid of the VHS copy and buy this one.
6305903182|5.0|Scream reinveted the horror genre which was dead for nearly a decade. Then a bunch of other horror movies that tried to copy it was released like: Urban Legend, I Know What You Did Last Summer, Valentine, and more. But the Scream trilogy remains the best and top dog. Scream was a terrific film and Scream 2 was not, but Scream 3 was the best. Scream 2 dissapointed audiences with nothing but just another horror film, but Scream 3 corrected that and brought the sereis to an end. Scream 3 was<br />funnyer and completely different from the first two, but Scream the orignal film reamined the scariest. Dimension Home Video did a excellent job in releasing this edition to Dvd. Scream 2  only included a theatrical trailer, which was all. This film is worth owning and I would buy it.
B000058T5E|5.0|Jeff Beck You Had It Coming (Epic)<br />This is BIG COLOSSUS MONSTER MUSIC and THIS ALBUM ROCKS! Picking up where his last studio album Who Else? left off, Jeff Beck turns up the fire even more on his new release You Had It Coming (Epic). Sure, those electro urban dance funk club rhythms underscore a number of tunes but so what? This material is 100% stronger on all points than the material on Who Else? (Depending what your taste is). Believe me, I like the latter, but compared to this album that was just the appetizer and this is the BIG main course. Those who though Jeff forgot how to whip out lighting fast guitar runs are in for a surprise. Listen to the fade on &quot;Left Hook&quot;. Those series of runs are blazing fast and played with accuracy and cleanliness not sloppiness. I wish that lead run was not on the fade and there was more of those on these songs, but that's life. &quot;Rollin' And Tumblin' gets a back to the roots classic rock approach like the Jeff of the Beck, Bogart, Appice period with the vocals handled by a new young  British singer Imogen Heap who's whiskey dry voice is the perfect fuel to this powerhouse workout. As for Jeff on this song he whips the slide and slashes razor sharp! Other smokers to rave about?  &quot;Roy's Toy, &quot; &quot;Dirty Mind,&quot; guitarist Jennifer Batten's tune &quot;Earthquake&quot; and the beautiful Indian song &quot;Nadia&quot;.  I can go on and on but I said enough. GET THIS CD AND PLAY IT LOUD!
B00003W8NM|5.0|Fight Club is the best movie that is out there right now. Not only is it so keen on its timing, but everything that is involved with it is superb. Edward Norton is one of the best actors in the world right now and he plays his part brilliantly. Brad Pitt is funny and gives life to his character. Helena Bonham Carter is great as the eccentric womam who just doesn't care.    Another aspect of this to be examined is that Fight Club was directed by the best director in show business, David Fincher. He is a genius and this movie only hightens that status. Every &quot;frame&quot; of Fight Club is interesting to look at. The DVD is truely great for its picture quality and the sound depth of the movie. In the end (and I won't spoil that for you) Fight Club is a smart, brilliant, funny, and suprisingly moving black comedy that only a few will be able to recognize the intensity of this movie on a higher level. Enjoy it and don't be a space monkey.
B0000399WI|5.0|The scenes from within the walls were just as it is (was) today.  The inside violence, the black market, and corruption are true to life.  Andy's cool attitude and determination capture your heart and get you to feel his pain and dispair.  When Brooks lost it when his parole came through demonstrated how &quot;institutionalized&quot; one can get after so long in captivity.  I strongly recommend this to the strong at heart, for the authenticity of the violence is not for the weak stomach.  The length of the movie is needed to create the mood of the film and anything shorter would cheat the movie watcher of the feel of the film.  I can't rate this film high enough.  A must see!
0684853523|4.0|I've spent too much of my life reading about writing rather than becoming famous enough to write about writing. Thankfully, King has done that for me (for us). He's written The Book I hope will be used in my kids' creative writing classes. Everyone who reads his book will understand much of what he writes about--the insatiable desire to read, the inborn urge to write, the importance of knowing the rules (and knowing when to break them). In only 228 pages, King gives us a biography and a textbook. His writing is frank, crisp, and surprisingly chatty. Reading it satisfied a day and a half of that insatiable desire, provided me insight into one of the most popular modern authors, and taught me more than four years of writing classes. If you've always dreamed of selling your words, buy this book. Then put it down and write.
0060916540|4.0|This was a fascinating tale of a miraculous survival from cold weather mountain climbing.  But it had enough surprises that I couldn't put the book down and read this quickly in two days.  Reading the maps, you know an accident occurs but until you read about the accident and how it affects the two individuals involved in the climb, you really can't appreciate the struggles these men went through.  Climbing such treacherous mountains requires perfect teamwork.  This accident challenged the teamwork and the commitment of the climbers.  By describing the critical events from the perspective of both men, it's really gripping to see how it affects both men.<br />This is a very short book and very quick read.  I strongly recommend this book for an exciting read.  My only complaint was that the technical mountaineering talk was over my head.  Only later did I discover the glossary at the end that would have partially helped with this.
B000009O8A|1.0|Can a movie get any worst than this?  My finger was on the fast forward button throughout most of this movie.  Way, way, way too many rape scenes and the only good part was when the movie ended.  The acting was way below medicore as was the directing, acting and camera work.  A five year old with a home video camera could make something better than this.
6303979882|5.0|Gather up your three best gal pals, one of those extra-large containers of popcorn (c'mon, you know you put it for some special occasion!), some soda, a nice comfy spot, and put Now and Then in your closest VCR and you'll thank me.<br />I first watched this at camp last summer - as part of a movie night where a blustery rainy day had turned to night and the counselors decided it was time to stop complaining how bored we were, it was time to watch a movie. So, in our bunk where she brought in a television and VCR (which, to our amazement, made us all want to sneak into the counselors' lounge more often than we already wanted to), we watched Now and Then beginning to end. Occasionally we cried. Often we laughed. But we had bonded over a movie that clearly described what we were - stereotypical 12 year old girls.<br />Watch Now and Then. If you're a preteen, teenager, or just 13 like me, you'll re-watch this again and again. It's one of the best movies around!!!
6304994540|5.0|This movie seems to have a you-either-love-it-or-hate-it aura, but nobody to whom I've ever recommended it has come away disappointed.  Perhaps that says something about the type of person with whom I associate.....<br />Anyway the film is a remarkable collection of caricatures, all brilliantly acted.  Bridges hits a solid high note as The Dude, and John Goodman is sterling as his traumatized Viet-Vet bowling buddy Walter.  The plot is sheer Coen chicanery, a doofus 90's send-up of the 40's hard-boiled detective flick.<br />Too many gags to sum up.  This one might require a second viewing just to take it all in, which strikes me as another reason this one wasn't all that well-received.  But multiple viewings are fine because, as with a &quot;Raising Arizona&quot; or &quot;Fargo&quot;, there are plenty of bits in this movie that just refuse to get tired.  If you're a fan of the Coen Bros. but missed this movie, you owe it to yourself to at least rent it.
0140149295|5.0|this novel of a man living  in a 6 by 6 ft. cell is a different perspective of the way it was for an african- american living in an extremely tough and turbulent time. Rubin takes you through his times as a troublesome youth growing up in Patterson, New Jersey to his prize fighting days to his times in prison. I would reccomend this book to anyone who is interested in black history or looking at a man's amazing personal  journey.
B00004YRQA|5.0|But it's good at being a memory card. Heck, they're probably all named Bob or something as well. Note that this only works for saving PS2 games--no putting all your PS mem saves onto this one--but it has a fast load time and holds a lot of memory. You could probably chew up 8 megs pretty fast, though, as most games that I've seen take at least 100kb per save, and multiple saves of the same game will start to make a dent, even though it should still last for a while. You'll have to get one of these, as the North American PS2's do not come with a mem card. And stay away from those third-party cards that lose all your data.
B00004Y6RO|4.0|Slayer isn't death metal, and neither is Sepultura or Slipknot. They are thrash metal, thats not to say that any of those bands are bad. I like all of those bands but if you think they are death metal or even remotely brutal than you are unaware of what brutal sounds like. Brutal is Cannibal Corpse, Dying Fetus and Deicide, and if you still think that your &quot;thrash/nu metal&quot; music is heavy then I can suggest a few more bands that are way beyond anything you have ever heard. Besides the fact that Slipknot are heavy only in respect to bands like The Deftones, Staind, and Korn, they certainly are unique and full of talent. I am impressed by the originality of Slipknot, and I'm not talking about their stupid masks and costumes. If you can get past their image, of which I find to be pretty stupid and pathetic, then will relize that Slipknot is not Korn, Sepultura or just another band. The percussion is great and vocals are fast and well written. Although Slipknot is not even half as heavy as most of the bands I listen to, I still enjoy giving the cd a whirl. If you like Slipknot you should check out Nasum, Mudvayne, and Will Haven.
B000002BYA|5.0|This has got guts man. Stevie gives one of his greatest blues performances on Dirty Pool which is done with horns and I thought I wouldn't like it but the horns on this album DO NOT override his guitar at all. So don't worry about that. This is far better than Live Alive which is still a good album. And better than In the Beginning too, though quite different. At the end Lenny and Rude mood are done just by Stevie Ray. His guitar may have been a little out of tune or the acoustics may have changed the sound but they were still great. The Things that I used to do is easily 1 of Stevie's highlights on record because it's with his brother Jimmie and it's just a great display of restraint on stevie's part I bet. Scuttlebuttin' starts it off and you can tell what kind of a show it's gonna be. The most of the show is like a big ol' party. Pride and Joy was excellent. If you don't own any SRV albums or any SRV live albums then this a great choice. The hardcore blues like cold shot dirty pool and things that I used to do are like I said really great but the rest of the album is just an up tempo blues and rock celebration. Angela Strehli only sings on one song. That's good. She added to the album but she didn't take away anything from stevie's vocals. Iced Over Testifyin' Rude Mood Honey Bee they all show Stevie's happy guitar playing side. The '' Stomping Roadhouse'' side as was mentioned in the New York Times when referring to SRV and friends changing of Carnegie Hall.  If you are an Srv Fan you will definetly love this. It's a smack in many crtitics face. He doesn't do any of the high staple acts  Voodoo chile- Texas Flood- Wham- Thirdstone from the Sun or Tin Pan Alley- and he still manages to prove himself a guitar hero and blues and rock legend.
B00000IAU3|4.0|I must admit that I was sceptical about enjoying this CD, as I am not too fond of anything thats too commercial. I was given this as a gift for Valentine's and almost immediately fell victim to Dido's irresistable voice and melodies. At last, here is a CD that is worth all the hype and marketing that is currently surrounding it.<br />Lets step through the entire CD, shall we?<br />First, the packaging : I loved the artwork in the CD Booklet. The black and red color contrasts work very well. The booklet carries all the lyrics, as well as photos from Dido's childhood. These are lovely reminders of her past and enhance the meaning of the lyrics to certain tracks. I thought the packaging was artistic without being tacky, and tasteful without being boring. As this is Dido's first album, I thought that the CD booklet told us the right amount of stuff, and introduced her without too much overkill.<br />Second, the music : The first voice that comes to mind when you hear Dido, is Sarah McLachlan. However, Dido's lyrics are not as serious or profound as Sarah's and I don't think this girl will be doing any Lilith Fair concerts anytime soon, simply because she is entirely different in her lyric style and musical content. She also reminded me of Joni Mitchell and Nelly Furtado in places, but its Dido's strong British accent that sets her apart from these singers. This is both enchanting and interesting, as she becomes one of the few British musicians who are doing so well in the US.<br />Tracks to look out for : Hunter, Thankyou, and 'All you want'. I especially liked the last one as it seemed somewhat Beatlesque and very 60's club-ish. Let it be known that there is not even one boring track on the album, and that each song is potential single material. This surprised me because rarely have there been albums of such caliber. However, I have known of some listeners who havent been able to 'get into' Dido upon first hearing the CD. Well, this is an album that grows on you, so give it time.<br />For those of you who are still wondering if you should believe all the talk and get the album, I would advise you to go for it. Its really worth the money. Dido is an acquired taste, but once you get used to her, theres no turning back! This could well be the best alternative pop album of the year, if only people gave it due credit.give it time.<br />For those of you who are still wondering if you should believe all the talk and get the album, I would advise you to go for it.

B000051VWW|5.0|Sade's unmistakably elegant, beautiful voice graces our troubled world once again.<br />With a voice as lovely as the woman, this disc showcases the magic of simplicity - attained when the singer is in the forefront and the musicians in heavenly accompaniment.<br />As opposed to pushing for popularity at any cost, this production unfurls the powerful musicianship of Sade and her immensely talented band members, which is more than enough.<br />It is a work worthy of admirable praise.
6305558167|5.0|This is an amazing rendition of the classic story of King Arthur. Twenty years after its release it is still one of the best sword &amp; sorcery movies available. The costuming, music and acting are superb! Nichol Williamson (who stars as Merlin) truly makes this movie, but every actor was excellent. You will also see early performances of Liam Neeson and Patrick Stewart (who still looks exactly the same).<br />All the elements are here:  Uther and Merlin. Guinevere and Lancelot. Camelot and The Round Table. The Quest for the Holy Grail. Mordred. The Lady in the Lake. And of course, the sword in the stone- Excalibur!<br />And while this movie may not follow the legend of King Arthur precisely- it is still a great introduction! After all, the story had been changed dozens of times even before Malory took it as his own. There can be little doubt that Excalibur is a wonderful epic- one which certainly belongs in the collection of any serious fan of fantasy.
B00004TRD8|5.0|This the only sequel I can think of which outdid the original.  T-2 is fabulous!<br />The story is very compelling, with Arnold as the good guy after being his malevolent best in the predecessor.  The first conflict between him on the Harley Davidson vs. Robert Patrick in the White Freightliner gets the heart pumping and the action keeps going.  <br />Unlike T-1, this has some surprisingly humorous moments, from the &quot;Bad to the Bone&quot; music when Arnold first appears as a biker, the T-1000 comparing himself to a silver mannequinn, and the best of all - trying to understand why he just cannot go around killing people by responding &quot;Of course, I am a Terminator.&quot;<br />Others commented on the additions this disc contains.  I also disliked the inability to move past promotional items.  But this is sure a worthwhile addition to any video collection.
B00003CXN3|1.0|I just came from the cinema where I saw &quot;Traffic&quot; and I can honestly say it was the most un-entertaining film I have ever seen. It really, and truly is boring. &quot;Traffic&quot; tackles the issue of drug abuse by teens, international drug cartels, and drugs in upper class neighbourhoods in an unorganized manner. Uninteresting characters are played by uninteresting actors, the scenery is the same for the most part, and the entire film has a very noticable void; originality. This is just your standard 'drug dealers playing with the cops' movie. Nothing special about this one. The camera is always shaky, as if it was a camcorder you would buy at Walmart to shoot movies in your back yard, which adds to the lack of charm this movie had. During the scenes in Mexico, Spanish is spoken. That translates to about 3/4 of the entire movie, where the speech is delivered in Spanish. I didn't pay ... to read subtitles of mindless conversation for two hours. The bottom line is that the plot never takes off, the characters fail to develop, and the audience is left asking themselves where they parked the car. This is easily the worst film I have ever seen.
B00000J2KX|5.0|The book is better than the film but the film itself is far more satisfying. This is probably the only film in the world that really gave me nightmares with its creepy shots of the hotel and the two girls. The scariest scenes for me where the old woman in the bathtub and the last shots of the girls. I think that certain aspects of the script are so well written and Jack Nicholsons performance is A1. You really have to sympathise with poor Jack for the monster he is turned into.  Now my rants.<br />1. The film was shot in 4'3 so you are getting the full picture aspect and you see even more than the cinema version which was cropped at the top and bottom. Any wide screen version that may come out in the future will be cropped just the same. It is an impossibility to get an anamorphic or letterbox edition of this film so you people should really learn a few things. JFK was transferred to widescreen like this and blatently had black lines stuck over at the top and bottom. 2. It was originally recorded in mono sound being 1979-80 and was played theatrically like this. This edition was overseen by Kubrick himself and the point of it is to restore it to how it originally was not to make any modifications. Splitting up mono tracks always takes the depth away from the sound. 3. The picture has been restored suitably enough and shows a gritty image the same as Aliens did. The picture is fine and I cant imagine it ever looked this good before. There. No more waiting for a true version which you make believe will come out some day because I dont ever think there will ever be another. GREAT FILM BY THE WAY.
B00004SU5J|1.0|This album is very bad. It get's one star for the beginning of  &quot;so flute&quot; and thats about it. I have heard people talk about it as being good acid jazz, but it doesn't deserve that title. I don't know what you would call it (and I don't care either), but  all that I know. is that it's a pathetic attempt at creativity.
630575067X|1.0|I am a strong Star Wars fan,  who was looking forward to this episode.  This was very predictable with no edge or excitement.  After watching 4,5, and 6, you already had the idea of what took place.  But to see it come together, it should be even more exciting.  Yet, it was boring and predictable.  Episode 1 lacked the action and intensity of 4,5,and 6.  And I was greatly dissapointed with how little Darth Maul was used.
6305363668|4.0|I'd seen the original several times, I'd read mixed review's of the director's cut, I thought I'd need to watch it a couple times at least to decide.  Not so.  I didn't miss the narration a bit.  Killing that single-track voice-over of why Deckard is saved frees up the moment for a world of more interesting musings.  The movie grows from a very good futuristic private-eye flick to so much more.  Let's hear it for the Director's Cut.
0060196122|5.0|I absolutely love this book, and is my pick for fiction of the year for 1999.<br />It was such a joy to read a book that was about life, without being maudlin or saccharine-sweetly moralistic. It most closely reminds me of the sort of work by people like Isabel Allende and Garcia Marquez. I will be looking for more by this author.<br />Veronika and her friends really make you examine your own views of 'madness' and it moved me to examine how I react when confronted with people who display different, unexpected or confronting beaviour in public. I came to understand that I probably move away, avoid, because it is the sheer unpredicatability of what may occur. We usually operate within a comfort zone of familiarity with our own and others' EXPECTED responses to situations, and for something to do otherwise IS challenging.<br />I wish all fiction was simultaneously as accessible - ie readable- and also leave something to think about, linger on. Not that everything has to be 'deep' or 'seriously profound', but it is like the difference between a nourishing, satisfying meal made from the best and freshest ingredients, and a fat-filled junk food takeaway.
6305744742|4.0|Just a fun movie to watch. Another of the just sit back and enjoy films without too much thinking. The DVD suffers however from a lack of extras. Just two trailers are included. Overall a good film to have in your collection if you like the humor. This DVD would benefit with an upgrade in features.
0688172377|5.0|Quite an extraordinary book. In the 'West'we don't see very many books of this kind - written by someone who might be viewed as a victim&quot; of barbaric cultural practices (female circumcision), but who allows us a real insight into her culture and life. Dirie rejects only ONE aspect of that culture, the outdated and ignorant practice, but otherwise embraces her cultural and familial roots. That is as refreshing as this book is readable.
6305358613|1.0|Because we live in a culture which more and more celebrates the mediocre above everything, we have examples of filmmaking like ELIZABETH. Clearly, when they earmarked monies for this production, they gave blank cheques to the production  and costume designers - alone. One seriously has to wonder if they remunerated the director and script writers of this film at all, considering the total neglect of content and narrative.<br />What a crashing disappointment and frustration to recognize a talented actor in Ms Blanchett, and yet see her appear in so little of the film. For a title character, she is astonishingly absent. I would like to credit this as having a good agent, who told her to spend as little time as possible on this sunken ship - but the sad fact is that the director, writers, and producers could not have cared less about the driving engine of this piece, Elizabeth herself.<br />From the start, the DVD is appalling - singularly, because of an excrutiating AUDIO MIX. The sound effects and incessant, forgettable music are distorted and at times deafening. This is because one has to raise the volume so high to be able to attempt to understand what is being spoken by the actors. And even then, their speech is whispered or swallowed - in some effort at 'gritty reality', I suppose.<br />As other reviewers have correctly pointed out, the story line is not only inaccurate but impossible to follow. The fact that Kapur and his team made no effort to help the viewer understand the labyrinthine confusion of this pivotal period in history is revealed in their exceedingly poor product. Not every historical film has to be didactic. Nor must every movie goer have an expert grasp of the subject. But, at least, upon watching an event in time, so thoroughly documented as Elizabeth's rise to power is, one should not end up more confused than one started.  And when the mere lavishing of millions on sets and costumes merits the kind of gushing admiration this film has garnered,you know we are in very deep trouble - not of losing our culture, but of literally having none at all.<br />Fanny Ardent, the great French actress who appears here briefly - and in the single scene where one can understand what is being said - had it right.  Show up, work two days, go back to France....and pray Shekhur Kapur nevers calls again.

0345440757|5.0|This book is great!  It has helped us understand our baby's body language and cues much better than we did.  At almost 11 months, our baby was not going to sleep on his own, nor could he sleep through the night.  With Tracy Hogg's tips and techniques, we now have a baby who can fall asleep without nursing, rocking, patting, walking, etc.  My husband read this book and now he understands that our baby does not need milk every time he cries.<br />There is a very helpful table that shows what different cries and movements indicate. For example, a baby that arches his back and pulls away from the person who is holding him or her is a very tired baby.  There is also a chapter for those parents (like us) who were doing all of the wrong things at bedtime and how to correct mistakes.<br />There were a couple of points on which I disagreed with the author, including her views on when babies should start eating solids and/or be weaned. But, overall, I found this book enlightening and a huge help.
630460288X|5.0|Brilliant action film where two of the most violent adversarys imaginable are pitted against each other in a pacifistic society!  One of Sly's best, meticulously thought out and totally even with the action not letting up for a second, and a great sense of humour thanks to an excellent script.  Also notable for several excellent fight scenes.  The UK version has one violent shot cut from the film, hence the UK disc has the audio commentary ommited (or else it would be out of sinc).
B000002IWQ|3.0|Presto and Roll the Bones pared down the wall of synthesizers that Rush was known for in the 80s, but it wasn't until this album that the band finally reverted into the heavy power-trio style.  Though the songwriting is in the same straightforward, accessible style of the previous two albums, Alex Lifeson supplies more loud, distortion-laden riffs than he had in years.  The music itself is erratic -- it starts out great (&quot;Animate&quot;, &quot;Cut to the Chase&quot;, &quot;Nobody's Hero&quot;), descends to an unremarkable mush in the middle and then finishes strong on the last four songs.  Fans of the band's early, metal days may really enjoy this back-to-the-basics Rush.
B000002H6C|5.0|I think this is Metallica's second best studio album behind Master Of Puppets.  My favs on it are Blackened, One, Harvester Of Sorrow, Frayed Ends Of Sanity, and To Live Is To Die (reminds me of Cliff Burton, miss you, man), especially the acoustic intro.  There's only one problem: the sound quality.  I mean, it's good, but it's not as crisp and clean as Master Of Puppets.  Also, the bass guitar is nearly left out of the mix.
B000056MOD|3.0|I was expecting this movie to be better. I thought that because both of the Highlanders were in it they would find a better way to have taken the evil immortal Jacob Kell. This can assure that this is the final chapter of the series and there will not be any more Highlander movies. I did not expect to see Duncan to do almost all of the fighting and Connor to do only one fight with which he almost got killed. In this movie there was too many flashbacks which took much of this short film. (1 hour 25 minutes).  Duncan is not seen for about the first 15 or 20 minutes. Joe was only shown for a short seen of about 5 minutes. I was glad they put Methos in this movie for a good part. I could   understand why they would not put Amanda in this movie for she had nothing to do with it. Richie, having the fact that he is dead,(died in the last episode of season 5 of the series) was not put in it either, although I wish somehow they got him in it. The fight seen between Duncan and all of the immortals working for Kell, I thought was awesome. I did like watching the flashbacks with both Duncan and Connor in it. The way I thought the movie was going to be, from looking at the coming attractions, is that Connor would have somehow split Jacob Kell into two personalities. Both would be evil. Then  they would both fight the two at the same time and kill them at the same time and have a fight seen and Quickening like in Revelation 6:8. That episode is about the Four Horsemen. At the end Duncan fought the leader of the Horsemen, Kronos and killed him while Methos, who was part of the Horsemen, did the same with Silas(Caspian had already been killed by Duncan). Unfortunately I was wrong and it happened differently.
B000002KB8|5.0|Tony Iommi's guitar is all over the place in Sabbath's debut.  Shows his skills on soloing by himself as well as carrying the band (check out final track).  Also features a cool bass solo by Geezer Butler.
B000059HCI|5.0|This is, without a doubt, the most intense and amazing film I have ever seen.  Ellen Burstyn gives the performance of the decade (and perhaps, of the century).  I could barely walk or breathe or think or do anything but FEEL when the film ended.  And be forewarned, you will not be feeling very good.  You should be in a good state of mind when you see it, or at least have someone you can be with or talk to at some point shortly thereafter.  I cannot remember the last time I was so profoundly affected by a film.  This is absolutely brilliant film making, and performances just simply do not come any better than this (and probably never will again).  It will be such an incredible crime if Ellen Burstyn does not win the Academy Award for this performance.  &quot;Requiem&quot; is also visually astonishing, and contains one of the most haunting and achingly beautiful scores I have ever heard.  For all of the well-deserved praise that has surrounded the film &quot;Traffic&quot; this year, &quot;Requiem&quot; is perhaps the most soul-searing and devastating depiction of the pain, despair, and horror of addiction that you may ever see. This film MUST be seen.  Seek it out if it is still in theaters, just see it, be amazed, and spread the word.  And PLEASE check out the film's Web site, especially after seeing the movie ([...]  It is the most creative use of the Internet I have ever seen, and it captures the tone of the film wonderfully.  Be patient and let it unfold in front of you--just move your mouse around the screen occasionally, but spend some time experiencing this site.
B000002H2H|5.0|This would be the 3rd best Metallica epic, behind Master and Justice.  Features just as much melody as heaviness!  The best songs are Fade To Black, For Whom The Bell Tolls, Creeping Death, and The Call Of Ktulu, which best displays Cliff Burton's phenomenal bass playing.  Also, the album has &quot;chilly&quot; feeling to it, which I like, hehe.
B000051VWW|2.0|To really enjoy these 11 tracks you have to be a Sade lover in extemis. There is hardly any variation in the style, rhythm or sound and after eleven tracks of the same I was tearing my hair out. Sade sounds as if she has just got out of bed and is still bemused by the world around her. This will not encourage me to buy her next one, despite having a collection of three of her previous CDs.<br />Harry
B000000993|5.0|Hail, fellow Tool fans.  Tool is the best alternative/metal band.  This album has spent more time in my CD player than any other.  This earns a toss-up w/ Aenima for the best Tool album.  My personal favorite is Swamp Song.  It really disappoints me that lots of people say they're completely serious all the time.  Just another example of how people jump to silly conclusions about music.  Believe me, they've got humor, just listen to the final track on this album.  Anyway, this is a true masterpiece, so snatch it up while you're here.

6304613199|5.0|The T-Rex, Velocirators, comsognathus, mamenchisaurus, gallimimus and so on, these dinos are unbelievably amazing!!! To say the truth I like the Jurassic Park a little better than this one but this one's also thrilling and exciting. It's possibly the best PG-13 film I've ever watched so far. The mercenary team tries to capture many dinosaurs and while Ian Malcolm and his team frees the dinos, the both teams faces extreme dangers and gets stranded on the Isla Sorna. Will they ever survive? Find out while you're watching this fantastic film!!!
B00000J9HF|5.0|This is not one of the most famous recordings of Verdi's warhorse, but in my opinion it is the best.  The great Italian conductor Carlo Maria Giulini stays away from the melodramatic caricature of opera that this can easily turn into, and brings out the dark, brooding colors of the drama and of the music.  He combines lyricism with the greatest dramatic power, at speeds which feel exactly right, even though they are slower than most.  And not only does he have a superb individual view of the piece, he is a sensitive accompanist, too, giving the excellent Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra its full dominance without drowning out the singers.  And what singers!  The velvety, golden voice of Piero Cappuccilli, used with unfailing intelligence and musicality; the warm, gorgeous voice of Plcido Domingo; and perhaps most stunning of all, the bewitching lyric soprano of Ileana Cotrubas, the best Gilda I have ever heard.  These singers may not hit the stratospheric unwritten high notes on the Bonynge recording with Pavarotti, Milnes and Sutherland, but they do offer consistently refined, thoughtful and beautiful singing.  Cotrubas' radiant singing alone is worth the modest price of this set.  The great Bulgarian bass Nicolai Ghiaurov makes a riveting, dark-toned Sparafucile; Elena Obraztsova sings Maddalena perfectly well, though not on the level of her colleagues.  Kurt Moll is cast luxuriously as Monterone.  At mid-price, with full libretto and translation and with excellent work from the VPO and chorus, this is a Rigoletto that must be in all Verdi collections.
0440219078|3.0|I liked this book mainly for one reason.  It really gets you thinking.  This is a what if book on how things would be if everything were uniform.  This book was interesting because it kept taking sharp and unexpected turns.  You never knew where the author was taking you.  Although I personally did not like how the book ended it didn't take much away from the book.  I like much different endings than the one that this book had.  I gave it a three because it became confusing at parts and as I previously mentioned I would have preferred a better, but overall the author makes you think about some very intriguing concepts and does a great job keeping my attention.  This is hard, because I often like to doze off while reading, which I found really hard to do because I always wanted to know what came next.
B00004Y7SF|5.0|This girl has got the goods. She really knows how to sing and control her voice. With a 6 Octave voice range, you cannot go wrong with her. This is a great X-mas album, from a very promising artist, and a diva in training.
B000002AV5|5.0|This cd is awesome. This is some nice, relaxing music. I remember when my brother first bought this cd, I was like &quot;Who is Sade&quot;. I had never heard of her. As I listened to it, I realized how talented and great this women really was. Sade is amazing, this album is awesome because it's her greatest hits album. I recommend everybody to get this album, because you won't be disappointed.
B000006XSD|5.0|Alice Cooper has always followed the fashion: Psychodelic Rock of late '60's, Hard Rock in the early '70's; Pop Rock (Disco) in late '70's; New Wave of the early '80's; Heavy Metal rage of the late 80's, only to follow it all with a couple of Hardcore/Industrial albums in the 90's. I love him all anytime, anywhere; because he became a part of my life from the first sounds of 'Love It To Death' in 1971. If you're a true Cooper fan, buy this album: it's one of the best he ever made. If you only care about his hits, buy one of his compilations; there's more than plenty of such at the nearest Walmart store. My favorite albums are: &quot;Love It To Death&quot;, &quot;Lace &amp; Whiskey&quot;, &quot;Trash&quot; and &quot;Hey, Stoopid&quot;. I never skip a song when I listen to those.
B000002UDB|5.0|OK, so it wasn't originally laid out like it is on the CD, but come on, nothing here is throwaway.  Blue Jay Way has such a vibe to it, it's unreal.  I have friends that even think the first half is BETTER than the second half!  Production-wise, this stuff is a neat transition between new-found lushness on Sgt. Pepper and the White Album (pared-down in parts but by then having attained absoulte control).  Baby, You're a Rich Man - how come no one ever talks about this song?  Keep in mind that Penny Lane and Strawberry Fields were originally slated for Sgt. Pepper, in place of 'When I'm Sixty-Four' and 'Lovely Rita.'<br />All in all, absolutely necessary.
0399146253|4.0|This book could have easily been included in Black Notice simply by adding a few more chapters.  You get the feeling that Cornwell killed off Benton but is not quite ready to let the character go.  I get the feeling that she wishes she could somehow bring him back to life.  It's time for Lucy to stop hopping from one woman to another and for Marino to get over his crush on Kay or do something about it.
B000002UB3|5.0|Strangely enough, though I've heard this album hundreds of times, I still don't own it.  It passes through my life, I become re-acquianted with it, then I don't need to hear it for a while.  Frankly, though I was born 5 years after the breakup, no pop music of my generation has approached the adventure and sublimity(?) of mid-to-late period Beatles, and this album in particular.<br />For the record, You Never Give Me Your Money is Paul singing all the way throughout, not Paul, John and George taking turns singing, as someone below maintains.  Also, on Golden Slumbers, its Paul singing, not John, and on Sun King, it is fake Italian/Spanish - listen for 'paparazzi,''para mucho,'a bunch of phrases that make no sense in succession.  A neat little humorous deflation of the cosmic aura set up earlier in the song, typical Lennon humor.
B00005214X|5.0|This cd sounds better than ever-apparently from toning down the intrusive &quot;wall of sound&quot;  Easily the best of all the Beatle solo albums.  George would never approach the greatness of this album again-but he was outstanding with this one.  You have to wonder how the Beatles ever passed on songs like &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; and &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; for plastic fantastic artistic trash like &quot;Revolution #9&quot; or throwaways like &quot;Why don't we do it in the road&quot;  Clearly this was the time period when George was at his best--following his great songs on Abbey Road!  The picture on the CD sleeve is also a great addition!
B00001ZT0K|4.0|Uriah Heep was reborn (or was it re-reborn?) as an 80's heavy rock band with the release of Abominog. While this album,er.. CD, bears little similarity to Heep's David Byron-era works, the best tracks on Abominog are some of Uriah Heep's best rock. That's The Way That It Is (remember the bad MTV video?),On The Rebound,Too Scared To Run,etc. are great. The worst tracks on Abominog aren't bad,just basic formula 80's rock. If you've come this far in checking out this CD, my advise is buy it. Abominog should be in every Heepster's collection.
B000002UD0|1.0|This album proves that John may have very well been the most over rated Beatle.  &quot;Whatever gets you through the night&quot; is one of the worst songs he ever recorded-God only knows how it ever became a hit-perhaps it was some cosmic dawning of disco consciousness.  I'd rather listen to &quot;Who has seen the wind&quot;!!! I once thought this was his absolute worst album-not counting garbage like &quot;Two Virgins&quot; and other unfinished music--but then he came out of retirement with &quot;Double Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Menlove Avenue&quot;  Maybe we should have all been looking for clues on the Beatle albums that John was dead instead of Paul.  How the mighty are fallen...
B00000J6AG|5.0|This is one of the most extrodiary albums I've heard in... ever. I'm not even a tehno fan, I like southern rock. I wake up to this CD every morning, and listen to it all the way through at least once a day. The music is equally good to listen too while working, playing or doing anything... else;). All I can say is buy it, and buy it NOW.
B00004RFCM|4.0|Sex in the City is a real eye opener. You really get a sense of just how generic and bland network TV is when you watch these made-for-HBO shows.<br />This series tells the tale of four career-driven Manhattan women and their relationship and sexual experiences. The stories are all Manhattan-centric and revolve around predominantly self-centered, wealthy, egocentric people, but despite all that they have a lot of truth to tell about how people are today. Their motives, their fears, hopes and desires.<br />Sarah Jessica Parker plays a columnist who writes articles on the sexual trends and obsessions of her fellow New Yorkers. Each episode revolves around her weekly column.<br />I've never been a big Parker fan, but this show has definitely made me re-evaluate her as an actress. Great viewing with great humor and very true-to-life characters.
B000006ZL4|4.0|Made in JAP in 2000, Serial# TOCP-50913, Playing Time 65:28<br />Originally released in 1996, this is Symphony X's 3rd masterpiece (and album). The constant analogies to Dream Theatre are probably due to the fact that SymX also blend metal and prog, but SymX's compositions have somewhat of a &quot;grandiose&quot; touch to them.<br />Each song has its own merit, which is probably what explains the popularity of the band. Perhaps not including as much &quot;classical&quot; influences as another excellent band, Shadow Gallery, the consistent quality of the SymX albums puts them in a category of their own. The title track, an &quot;opus&quot; in 7 parts, demonstrates how well this band can switch gears between harmonic metal and prog: I'd call it &quot;fusion metal&quot; instead of &quot;prog metal&quot;, because NOTHING in their material reminds me of prog bands (e.g. Yes, early Genesis, etc.). These discs contain energy galore, with rich and full textures.<br />I'm not going to join the debate as to which of their albums is better; each has its personnality, and this one is divine...
015626224X|4.0|A neutral, `lived-through' account by Orwell in London and Paris of the late 1930s. Orwell writes succinctly, openly, and without any emotive fluff. Orwell lets the situations, and the descriptions of poverty and the terrible workplace conditions speak for themselves. A perfect, lively account of the events Orwell lived through, and for that has more meaning than simply a neutral social history account.
B00003CX8J|5.0|I've always thought that comic strip screen adaptations are ahit and miss affaiir.Not only has it got to be so escapist andentertaining as to distract you from the implausability of it all, butfor every BATMAN there's a BATMAN &amp; ROBIN.For every BLADE there'sa SUPERMAN IV:THE QUEST FOR PEACE!! Not being that familiar withX-MEN,I thought this might have failed.D'OH!!! What an excellentmovie.Definitely one of the best movies of 2000. For theuninitiated(ME!!) it's the start of a great new movie franchse,and agreat introduction to the X MEN universe.This is done through the eyesof its newer member,WOLVERINE(Hugh Jackman).What a revelation! Notonly does he provide a dark edge to an otherwise family summerblockbuster, but he steals the show with some killer lines andput-downs of CYCLOPS(James Marsden). Also a bit of inspired casting oftwo great Shakspearean actors,Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan asflipsides of the same coin.One preserving the fragile peace betweenhuman and mutant in a not too distant future,the other pushing forconfrontation. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.My only gripe was thatit was all over too soon.  You'll be pining for X MEN 2 like you wouldbe for ... &amp; 3.There,I said it!! ... and X MEN in the samesentence.It's that good!!  Now then: the DVD.I have to say that beinga lover of Region 2 discs,I found this to be as perfect Region 1transfer as you'll ever get. You get a really groovy animated menu inthe form of a 3D moving image of Xavier's &quot;BIG ROUND ROOM&quot;!!The extras? I don't know where to start! Not only do you get a wealthof trailers,you get a &quot;newscast&quot; expanding on BruceDavidson's MUTANT Summit,and an interview with Bryan Singer.Did Imention storyboards? Also a screen test of Hugh Jackman with fellowAntipodean, Anna Paquin(great chemistry).  The big extra,though,is notonly do you get a wealth of deleted scenes,you can choose to watch aspecial X-tended Branching Version which jumps out of the mainfeature,and inserts therelevent deleted scene into the movie.Much inthe same way as the &quot;White Rabbit&quot; mode of the ...DVD. I've had this DVD since Christmas and I can't get enough ofit. So go on. Treat yourself!!  THE FATE OF THE HUMAN RACE DEPENDS ONIT!!
B00000DGUG|4.0|Jagged Little Pill was a hard act to follow, but Alanis did it right to not make a JLP part 2. This record is not so accesible as JLP, but it's very edgy and there is a lot of darker material present here. It took a long time before I could appreciate it. Although it's a bit to long (17 songs) there are some very good ones here. Thank U, Unsent, Are You Still Mad and Front Row are among my favourites.
B00004Y87O|5.0|The world has change into a dark and cruel planet by 1988, every year there been more crimes getting worse. Now most major cities become maximum security prison. Now in 1997, one of the world most will known cities cities of world become a prison in the city of New York City, the innocents and the criminals are all mixed together in the city. When an air force one has about to crush into the city, the presdent of the united states (Donald Pleasence) escape in pod ship and then he gets kidnap by the criminals in the city.

Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround is dated but it has some strong moments of surrounds including in the end credits. Theatrical Tralier is included. We hope MGM DVD will do a special edition like an remastered Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround, original commentary track by director John Carpenter and actor Russell. Benind the scenes footage, i hope Carpenter could find the whole original opening footage where Plissken steal money in a maximum security bank, that how he got to go and sent to new york. Original interview by Carpenter was interesting also. New interviews with the cast and crew. My favorite Carpenter film is The Thing, second is Vampires and Thrid is Escape from New York. Carpenter is one of the best directors in our geneation, including the ones who love his third film Halloween which become anunexpected original unique horror film. Escape from New York become an original science fiction with a blend of action and dark humour. The Latest DVD from MGM has now a HD anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an sharp-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has Two Great Commentaries by the Filmmakers and Cast Member:Kurt Russell. One of the Coolest Extra on the Second Disc is the Original 11 Minute Deleted Scene that was supposed to open the Movie with/without commentary by Director:Carpenter and Actor:Russell. It has Behind the Scenes documentary, Trailers and More.<br />Trivia:Russell has a scene with the actress Season Hubley, that his ex-wife. Carpenter was married to actress Adrienne Barbeau (The Fog, Creepshow). Issac Hayes played the villian here as the duke of new york, he`s will known singer, including the immortal classic song Shaft and he also voiced Chief in the cult T.V. show-South Park. This movie has one new york shot, the scene takes in the island, the rest was shot in St-Louis. Jamie Lee Curtis (Uncredited) voiced the opening credits, telling the audience, what happen to the world and now become an dark and dangerous place to be in. Grade:A. Panavision.
B000053ZRR|5.0|This disc is highly recommended. Great video very clear and crisp and the audio rocks with Dolby 5.1 channel(don't worry what's written above that it's only 2.0 stereo it's not it's in 2.0 surround and 5.1 surround). Don't know about what's written above on technical details which say's that's in full screen format but actually  when i played this disc it's in widescreen format all throughout the whole concert, and it's great seeing Jon and the band all in one stage. Very lively and energetic concert shouldn't miss it if youre a Bon Jovi fan or just a DVD buff who loves music DVD's. Either way you won't regret buying this disc, I love this disc. Good job island records !

B0000508U6|5.0|don't panic when you realize that this music may hold more depth in its lyrics then the melody. COldplay is brilliant in its simplicity. &quot;we live in a beautiful world, yeah we do, yeah we do&quot; How riveting are the emotions when these words are reminded to us? It's about time some real music came along :) if you like the album, i suggest seeing them live, it's the cherry on top of an already wonderful sundae
0060958324|5.0|The significance of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is incredible. Pirsig takes his readers on two very important trips; one through the states to Bozeman, Montanna and a profoundly significant philosophical journey. Pirsig confronts his former self, Phaedrus, as well as some of lifes most perplexing questions. He does so using the dialectic and rhetoric as tools for discussion. The author's former self, Phaedrus, is consumed by the Aristotelian point of view and all that it stands for. Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is read today, and remembered by scholars who read it when it was first published, and they continue to be amazed; as will I in twenty years.
B00004ZD69|4.0|&quot;Lift yr. skinny fists like antennas to heaven!&quot; is a truly remarkable record.  Radio airplay couldn't be further from this band's mind given that the tracks are well over 20 minutes each.  Musically, the only artists that remotely resemble GYBE are Sonic Youth and Philip Glass (who do not remotely resemble each other).  Imagine the melodic and harmonic beauty of Glass' operas (sans vocals) coupled with the great droning, clanging electric guitars of &quot;Daydream Nation.&quot;  Wonderful, engrossing listening.  And no, it's not pretensious (unless you think anything but verse-chorus-verse-4-minutes-later-and-I-hope-it-was-good-for-you is pretensious). BwO
0679879269|5.0|I was left hanging at the end of The Subtle Knife, nearly crying to know what would happen next. And the minute I opened the Amber Spyglass I knew I wouldn't be disappointed. I stayed up for four hours straight in the middle of the night reading of Will's struggle to find Lyra and keep her safe, of the Chevalier Tialys and the Lady Salmakia's journey to bring the children to Lord Asriel, and of Mary's meeting with the mulefa. I have never felt so strongly about a book, and although an avid reader, I must say I have never in my 14 years read anything better. The Hobbit impressed me, The Amber Spyglass amazed me. I have cried over many books but never so much when Lyra left Pan, or felt so much joy for Lyra and Will. If you do not read this or the other two books in the trilogy, you are robbing yourself of this treasure that the gifted Philip Pullman has extended to us.
0800128052|5.0|I was browsing through an electronics store's video section the afternoon after I had taken my last finals of the semester when I came across Rudy.  Seeing that it was a football film, I was reminded of how much I had enjoyed Remember the Titans, even though I'm not much of a sports fan, so I decided to take a chance and buy it.<br />It's definitely worth the purchase.  &quot;What's so great about this movie?&quot; you may ask.  It has good comedy, very touching scenes, great actors, and most of all, a wonderful message.  This film says that you don't have to be the smartest, biggest, or strongest person out there-you just have to want to reach your goal enough.<br />Rudy is the true story of a boy presiding in Indiana.  Ever since he was a child, his dream was to be a football player for the Catholic college Notre Dame.  Everyone but his best friend were very skeptical of this.  Rudy was small, his maximum height eventually being 5' nothing, physically weak, and day-dreamed during school, making it seemingly impossible for him to make the grades it would need to make it to Notre Dame.  Four years after graduating high school and leaving the high school football team, he worked at a steel mill with his best friend.  But soon, he raises enough money to go to a different college named Holy Cross, and he works hard to get high enough grades for Notre Dame to accept him.<br />The will that Rudy (Sean Astin) has in this movie is amazing.  His dream is quite innocent, but his determination is relentless.  This film is inspirational; I guarantee it.  I promise that by the end of this movie, you will be in utterly amazed by Rudy's determination to accomplish his goal and fulfill his dream, especially through the hardships he face.  If you don't end up loving this movie like myself and many others, you will at least respect Rudy for all the trials he fought his way through.
B00004STPT|5.0|its just all around great.
B000008H1Y|5.0|While when most of my friends gives their opinion as &quot;Aqualung&quot; or &quot;Thick as a brick&quot; being Jethro Tull's best work. I will give my nod to this wonderful album called &quot;Songs from the wood&quot;. Like the name hints this album is very much folk influenced. All the songs are good (and from the wood). The title track, Hunting girl, The whistler, Pibroch (Cup in hand), Fire at midnight are too good. Actually I should write name of all the songs. This album should have influenced a lot of artistes. I don't know whether it really had, but one thing I can write this is one of the best albums of all time. Anderson's flute never sounded so good. Tull never sounded so gentle and at the same time so creative. If you want to buy a Tull album (if not why are staring at this page) buy it. Then go for Aqualung, Crest of a knave and other amazing stuff.
B0000027I6|5.0|The five star rating is something given too liberally by most, and I for one am seldom prone to give it to anything but the finest pieces I own. I do not hesitate to say that Amused to Death deserves it. In a musical cesspool of righteousness and pretentious idealism, Amused stands as one of the few works so well developed as to refuse to deliver a true answer to the questions it raises. It diplays the desecration visible in society and the media, and simultaneously stands as a monument to futility in light of human nature. It is fully rounded and three-dimensional, something rarely seen in works discussing such things as human nature and politics (see: every punk album ever made). I wouldn't reccomend it to everyone--I don't think everyone's capable of enjoying its more subtle aspects. But if you think you're up to it, it's a hell of a ride.
0394720288|5.0|Bertie Wooster's is a different world.  A different world indeed, even from the jazzy age of 1920s and 30s England that P. G. Wodehouse employs as his setting.  The code of the Woosters is to never let a friend down, and Bertie would do this far more often were it not for his tactful and clever gentleman's personal gentleman, Jeeves.  Bertie is a marvelous type of fellow: over-educated but under-intelligent; useless to society but wealthy beyond any need for scruple; completely numbed by the simple pleasures of an aristocratic life, but always there for his friends and family in a pinch.  Amusingly enough, very few of the people that Bertie is enlisted in aiding actually deserve anyone's help.  He is variously bullied and cajoled--but usually blackmailed--into putting himself in the most precarious positions.  He must steal a cow-shaped piece of silver or his Aunt Dahlia will never let him eat a meal served by her godly French chef; he must steal a policeman's helmet to indirectly prevent himself from betrothal to a starry-eyed ditz of a woman.  Being a Wooster, of course, he would go through with such a wedding rather than be impolite.<br />What makes Bertie's bumbling and stumbling antics the more amusing is that he fancies himself a man of wit and decisiveness.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Jeeves is the man for that, as well as the man to keep Bertie from his predilection for screaming fashion faux pas.<br />Wodehouse employs a wonderfully dry wit and a delivery that ranges between the anecdotal and the rat-a-tat.  One finds oneself smiling through every page, and occasionally being forced to place the book on the side table so as not to harm in during a fit of laughing out loud.  Wodehouse's influence on writers such as Evelyn Waugh, Kingsley Amis and Stephen Fry has enriched British literature of the last century, but he himself was a true original, as are Jeeves and Wooster.
078322687X|5.0|I Saw this movie on TV last night and I was just amazed at how awsome this movie was, There were very funny parts and there were parts that reached out to you, each character was unique in there own way, I think this is a movie I won't forget.
B000001A9P|5.0|This is one of the best albuns of 90's. &quot;Dancing to the Rhytmn&quot;is the best song of the album. Others classics and good moments: &quot;Pastime Paradise&quot;, &quot;Sir Duke&quot;, Master Blaster (jammim) - The reggae's song and the super classic, &quot;Superstition&quot;. My suggestion if you like Stevie Wonder: Buy it!
B000002MFE|5.0|Eric Clapton Unplugged, as i said in my title, is one of the best LIVE albums ever.  I am normally turned away from live albums because of their quality.  This album however, is excellent!!!! Clapton goes through a set of 14 songs.  Some of the songs include classics like Layla and Tears in Heaven, a song about the tragic death of his son.  This is truely one of the saddest songs i have ever heard.   I would have thought that changing Layla from electric to acoustic would mess up the whole song, but when Eric is making a song, anything can happen.  His musical genius is extraordinary.  Not one song on this cd is a filler.  Words cannot explain how great this cd is. Worth buying!
B00000ILDE|5.0|I must admit that I am a person who normally loathes sequels of any kind. So many times sequels seem to be done to &quot;cash in&quot; on the original- and many times I have left a theatre feeling &quot;ripped off&quot; realizing this.<br />I would have to say after seeing the original Alien my expectations were not that high. I basically went to see Aliens for the &quot;curiosity&quot; factor. I also had nothing better to do that evening.<br />Aliens is a worthy sequel to the original because nothing was compromised. The story held true to the original and many questions were answered in Aliens that were not in the first one.<br />I just finished watching the DVD version of Aliens. This is an excellent DVD!! So well produced and transferred in &quot;real&quot; letterbox format. The added 17 minutes of the movie also answer a few questions. I never knew that Ripley had a daughter- this would explain why Ripley was so close and extremely protective of Newt. I really appreciated her character more thinking this- it added more dimension to Ripley- as a mother.<br />The added footage also explained the happenings on LV-426 before and during the attacks by the Aliens. We also get to see Newt's family and what happened to them. I think that this adds more dimension to Newt.<br />In all, Aliens is an excellent addition to any sci-fi DVD library. Extras galore on the DVD version- cool behind the scenes stuff, trailers, star bios, ect. Worth the money for the extras alone!! It's a great movie- even if you didn't see the original.<br />As I stated before- I think that most sequals are inferior to the original. Aliens is an exception to this rule. I just wish that more sequels were as good as this one!
B000002LLC|5.0|I am a big fan of film soundtracks and almost missed out on this one because, in spite of Madonna's phenomenal vocal work, I was looking for the soundtrack with songs written by Stephen Sondheim.  DUUuuuuuhh! This is THE ONE!    Hearing Madonna explore Sondheim's words vocally lead me to an eye-opening new aspect of her talent.  Let's not forget the heart-wrenching duet with that other Broadway great Mandy Patinkin on &quot;What Can You Lose?&quot;    Frankly, this is the album that helped me truely appreciate Madonna.
B000006TRV|5.0|This album was looked upon as a worthless cd before. as i grew i began to appreciate the cd for what it really represented....life.  You may say that cd is just for people who grew up in the 70's but i am 13 and this is one of my favorite albums. Many people say you shouldn't get it as your first floyd album, but i did and i didnt make a difference.
B000002H97|5.0|All right, this album is a far cry from &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot;. But nevertheless I think it is their second best.<br />Yes, the sellout was dead on here, and yes, too many people started listening to Metallica right here. But after all, this is still a damm good album, especially considering how far they have fallen since then. ( Load, Reload, S&amp;M - all TOTALLY TERRIBLE!! )<br />Metallica definitely still rock on this one. And it has tons of great songs on it that you can listen to without being ashamed :  &quot;Enter Sandman&quot;, &quot;Sad but true&quot;, &quot;The Unforgiven&quot;, &quot;Wherever I may roam&quot;, &quot;Nothing else matters&quot;, &quot;My friend of Misery&quot;, &quot;Of Wolf and Man&quot;, &quot;The Struggle within&quot;. All class-a songs!<br />Yes, complain about their sellout, but don't complain about the album itself! It saved a lot of souls from popmusic and converted them to the real thing (mine included)!. It works on parties as well as on your own. It's easy listening somehow, but it's pretty great easy listening with the occasional hints at more. <br />Here is my Metallica discography in best-of order: 1.Ride the Lightning 2.Metallica 3.Master of Puppets 4.Kill em all 5.Justice for all 6.Garage Days ( The dreadful rest I won't even mention ) <br />Thanx for reading this and maybe for believing me
B00000IAU3|5.0|This wow album really touches the soul.  All of Dido's songs on this debut album are all different and unique, they speak to you in a deep sense.  Keep up the great work Dido and please continue to bring us new music!
B000002H72|5.0|If there was any band who just didn't seem to care how strange or noisy they came off, it would have to be The Pixies. But what they created was brilliant, offbeat, and catchy music. Good luck trying to figure out exactly what Black Francis' (now Frank Black) lyrics are about with his twisted tales and weird lines. The music is flat-out amazing rock that was very ahead of its time. Yeah, this was released in 1989, but it still sounds fresh today. The musicianship in the Pixies was great and it's a shame they are no more. At least they put out this excellent piece of work entitled Doolittle. Check out the Frank's psychotic chants on &quot;Debaser,&quot; the dark and twisted &quot;I Bleed,&quot; &quot;Wave Of Mutilation,&quot; &quot;Hey,&quot; and the classic &quot;Monkey Gone To Heaven.&quot; Hey, even the most accessible song, the poppy &quot;Here Comes Your Man,&quot; oozes with originality. If rock these days is bringing you down, take a trip back to 89 with Doolittle. And give it a few listens if it doesn't sink in at first.
B000056HOK|5.0|I think this little boxset is a great investment for people who dont know many songs from rammstein.For the same price as the normal sehnsucht u get another disc with a song from the first album &quot;Asche Zu Asche&quot; and five edited live tracks from the album live aus berlin.The first track is good for people who like the first album &quot;tight and Heavy&quot; the first track will also introduce the new fans to the first album.Good investment u must buy!!!! Will be rare soon!!!!
0783227434|4.0|Army of Darkness is one of those films that can boast that it's main protagonist is entirely unlikeable and obnoxious.  For Evil Dead fans who enjoy comedy, it's a total treat and really exists almost strictly for laughs.  The same crazy camera style and pacing of Sam Raimi is rampant throughout this film, much like the previous two films of the series.  Lets hope for another entry into this cult series!
B000001GGV|5.0|I saw the performance of these pieces at the beautiful, now closed, Ambassador Auditorium in Pasadena, Ca.  After having seen Mr. P several other times with mixed feelings due to his idiosyncratic approach at his young age, and knowing of Horowitz's splendid Scarlati, I was astounded by the professional and gorgeous approach he took to this music in live performance. While somewhat different in approach to Mr. H, it is perfect in all its own ways. It was unforgettable, and I have been to many piano recitals. The recording reproduces the performance as well as one could wish for and brings back some great memories.<br />Richard Jacobson
B000007T1M|5.0|Just look to Armenia to give us one of the most scathing, original, and important releases in modern metal.  System of a Down as a unit are as tight as they come.  The singer Serj's voice is sort of a mixture of Jello Biafra, Philip Anselmo(when screaming), and Maynard James Keenan; not a bad mixture.  Musically, SOAD shreds throughout the entire record, the guitarist is textbook metal, the drummer is excellent, and the bass work is great.  SOAD resemble a mixture of the TOOL and the Dead Kennedys in that some of their material is dark and moody, yet some is up tempo.  Serj manipulates his voice masterfully throughout the recording, his voice is just as important to this record as the guitar.  His voice adds depth to an already outstanding musical release.  If your are into metal at all, pick this one up, it will be the first of many important releases from this band.
0679746048|4.0|I really liked this book,it is a very honest account of dealing with depression(I've been there,so I know..) I just wish the book was longer,I guess I was expecting it to be like the film,which was great. A rather sketchy but affecting story.
B00000I9MK|5.0|Before I discovered Belle and Sebastian, I had been a victim to catchy choruses, fun beats, and infectuous voices . . . but never all together.  Belle and Sebastian mixed everything I love about music into one recording.  Tigermilk is the most fantastic album I have ever bought.  No bones about it. And I think I've discovered my niche in the music world.  Thank you Belle and Sebastian!
6304698658|5.0|This was a GREAT comedy movie!!! I've seen every Vacation movie there is, and every one is funny in its own way. This one is full of laughs and VERY funny moments.<br />Instead of traveling(like in every other &quot;Vacation&quot; movie)The Griswalds are going to invite the whole family over and have a &quot;Fun-filled old fashioned family Christmas&quot;.. NOT!! Every thing goes wrong... They get tailed by two thugs while driving out of town to get their christmas tree which is taller than their living room ceiling, Clarke puts in money ahead of time for a swimming pool, Clarke(Chevy Chase) puts 2,500 lights on his roof, and so on.<br />Then the realitives arrive, bearing arguments and family fights. And then Cousin Eddy(Randy Quaid)comes and surprises every one and &quot;shacks up with them.&quot; I don't want to give the whole movie away(especially the GREAT ending..)so I'll stop there.<br />I own this movie and have watched it over 50 times, and I laugh EVERY time! I highly reccommend buying this movie, it's worth the $....(This is definently better than Chase's Fletch or Funny Farm.)
B0000508U6|3.0|Rock n' roll, where have you gone?  I'm not so much lamenting about the quality of this shimmering, melancholy valentine of a record, as much as I am about the state of British rock in general.  I think those of us who are yearning for the next big Brit-band are eager to cling on anything coming out of the U.K., even if perhaps the musical act hasn't quite yet found its voice.  Those groups which recently made big splashes have either prematurely imploded (The Verve) or sunk in the weight of their own excess (Oasis).  Of course, this follows in the tradition of such shooting stars as the Stone Roses and the Smiths. Meanwhile, other U.K. bands seem content on playing it safe (Blur, Supergrass). Colplay's &quot;Parachutes&quot; is a fine start.  Chris Martin looks like Richard Ashcroft's happier, more chipper younger brother and sounds a bit like Jeff Buckley.  While, the musicianship on the record is first-rate, the songs reflect  mostly musical influences and less a distinct sound. Also, it wouldn't hurt to turn up the amps once in a while and deliver a good rocking number.  Certainly some songs make bigger impressions than others: &quot;Shiver,&quot; &quot;Yellow&quot; and &quot;Trouble.&quot;  Others are more musical and thematic explorations from a band which will hopefully showcase its best work in future records.  And let's all hope they don't meet the same demise as their influences.
B00003CXDG|1.0|The first Mission Impossible was a great movie, it rocked..  for some reason, someone thought that it would be a great idea to try and make another fortune off of our misfortune and create a sequel..  doesnt anyone in hollywood know that sequels by definition SUCK!!!   this one was definitelyt no exception to the rule..  with lame dialogue, horrible plot, terrible acting, and yet another tom cruise look at me i am so beautifulk ego trip, this movie lacked in every category..  the one thing that saved this movie from being a complete and total waste of time and effort was dougray Scott..,.. I never would have been able to see him as a villian until i saw it..  seeing was believing in this film..  otherwise, dont waste your time..
0553106635|5.0|I just finished book 3.  I almost wish that I had not learned of this series until years from now, when it will be complete.  Others have described its contents, its scope, the author's style and the unexpected twists in the story....no, it's not a story...it is a saga, an epic, a song of ice and fire.<br />There were times when I had to close this book and catch my breath.  Or cry a little.  There were times when I put it down for fear of what I would 'see' on the next pages.  Because you do see it. And smell it, and feel it.  <br />Do yourself a favor: Devour these books.  Let yourself be whirled away into the storm.  Experience this epic on a visceral level.  Then reread each book as critically as possible.  Catch the clues Martin has sprinkled throughout them.  Who are Jon Snow's real parents?  Who will be the dragonriders?  Who will wield the Red Sword?  Who, or what, is the power behind the Others?  What did Bran see when he flew with the three-eyed crow in the first book?<br />And while you read,  marvel at the economy, the lyricism, the pounding brutality, the complexity, and the sheer life and truth of Martin's words.  This is a stunning achievement.
B00003CXFV|5.0|In her dozen or so years in show business, Julia Roberts has played many roles.  A hooker, a movie star, a step mom, and Tinkerbell are among a handful of Roberts' roles in the past decade.  And in that time Julia Roberts has become \\"America's Darling\\" and one of the most recognizable (and highest paid) actresses in the history of cinema.  Yet, she has never clutched an Oscar in all those years.  So, to say that her Oscar-nominated performance in Erin Brockovich is well deserved would be a tragic understatement.  Roberts takes on the roll of a double divorcee-single mother of three struggling to earn enough money to get by.  Playing Brockovich is easily the most challenging role of Roberts' illustrious career.  But it was also, in turn, the greatest performance of her career.  What makes this a standout role for Roberts is the fact that she has built up that \\"squeaky-clean\\" image over the course of her career.  She almost always played the role of the vixen, or the damsel in her most memorable movies.  But now, she plays a foul-mouthed, and cunning ex-beauty queen... a far cry from Tinkerbell indeed.  And Julia Roberts stood and delivered the entire length of the movie.  However, Roberts is not the only one to make the movie as great as it is.  Steven Soderbergh's directing job is flawless in this film.  He helped create a movie based on a true story that is, in fact, very believable, humorous, witty, clever, and moving all at the same time.  Erin Brockovich could very well be the best film of the year.  It is certainly well rounded in terms of production.  Great casting.  Great direction. Great Acting.  Great Writing.  Great Film.   And so on Oscar night... Julia Roberts may finally get the recognition she deserves.
B000056K04|5.0|Dave Matthews band steps away from the sound most fans have become used to and in some ways that is good. I own every album by them, and love all but about 4 songs total by them. EVERDAY is a totally different type of music, different sounding guitars, less boyd (alot of moore on sax), and even a guest apperance by carlos santana on mother father. What i am trying to say is although i love all daves albums, i think they needed a new type of sound, i am upset they threw out songs like grace is gone and bartender for the new cd, but the new cd has some great songs. the space between and what you are use types of electric sounds and they sound sweet. some people have said dmb has gone commerical with this cd, i just think they wanted a new, hip sound. they accomplished it with everyday.

B000002HPV|5.0|After a turbulent period in Bjork's life it was inevitable that the follow up to the magnificent &quot;Post&quot; would be a more darker and subdued affair.<br />   Bjork uses the Icelandic landscape of her native country as the inspiration for the music on this disc.Iceland has a cold and rugged landscape, full of icy glaziers and tempestuous volcanos and can seem a forbidding place, but, it is these qualities that give the place it's stark but undeniable beauty.The more you explore this landscape the more hidden beauty you discover.And it is these qualities that you find in the music.<br />   Bjork uses the unusual collaboration of cutting edge dance technology with classical orchestration to create this musical landscape and it works perfectly.My personal favourites are the towering &quot;Bachelorette&quot; and the sublime &quot;All is full of love&quot; but the sum of the album is greater than its parts.<br />   Instead of resting on her laurels Bjork has created a brave and challenging album that rewards the listener with repeated playing, add to that the fact that these songs are being sung by one of the most remarkable voices in music, then surely you are on to a winner.
B000009MF7|5.0|Simply, these are the absolute best performances of the Ravel concerti I have heard yet!
B00004YA66|5.0|WoW! Great movie! Ok... its a tad hooky and it moves a little slow... (Just a little) but there are parts that keep you watching the whole way through that are just intense!!! Of course when the plot begins to unfold you are on the edge of your seat the rest of the way and the ending is unbelievable! I was just amazed at how wonderfully entertaining and clever the entire movie was.  If you watch this movie STAY FOR THE END because this movie makes you feel great!
0375703764|5.0|I can understand all the people who hated this book; it is definitely NOT for everyone. For one, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone of average intelligence, because it is a book of intellectual decadence and it will absolutely blow your mind if you can grasp it.<br />I have wanted to be a writer, but reading this book discourages me because I know that I could never be this good. Though I shouldn't let it discourage me, because *nobody* could ever be this good except Mr. Danielewski himself. No other writer in history which I have ever encountered is half this talented. It raises the bar by an unbelievable amount... it's a whole new paradigm of writing, using stylistic arrangement as well as just the words... this is a book that could never be perfectly converted to video, because it's more than just the story that is unbelievably gripping; it's the way the book is arranged.<br />I would recommend this to a lot of people, except it does have some extremely explicit and graphic sex scenes. Don't read it if you are disturbed by sexuality.<br />If you're an intelligent, open-minded thinker, who loves literature, get ready to discover the best book of the century, the millennium, or perhaps ever. I can not even begin to express the power that this book has over me, and the awe I feel of Mr. Danielewski. <br />If the whole world were on fire, and I could only save one book, this would be it, because it is the pinnacle of human literary achievement. Ever since the first written alphabets in Sumer and Phoenicia, history has been leading up to this: House of Leaves.<br />&quot;This is not for you.&quot; This is perhaps true for many. Know thyself.
B000002GY9|5.0|From the cover design to the spaces between his cigarette breaks this cd moves me into a mood that is like taking a drug of some kind. It's all about life and being broken by it but still holding on and finding redemptin in the blues...Satchmo lived it...Waits tells it...and I listen...perfect chemistry of soul
0064471837|5.0|Absolutely brilliant. Although I like fantasy books, I tend to give up on them easily if I get confused with the bizzare worlds and characters involved. Sabriel was an exception. Despite the fact that the setting  was fantasticly strange, Nix brought it to life so cleverly that it seemed completely real and understandable to me. His grasp of the characters and of the plot is, to be repetetive -- brilliant! This author is second only to Philip Pullman on my list for the ability to tell a grand story with flair -- I couldn't put Sabriel down!
B00004XMTH|5.0|Cats on tape has captured the essence of Cats on stage, and even better, cause you are now up close and personal with the different cats.  You can admire the wonderful make up jobs they all have and the wonderful costumes that had so much time spent on them.  You can observe the relationships and the personality of each cat more closely now.  I have to admit, the performer that really grabbed my attention in this video has to be Jacob Brent.  He is the best ever Mr. Mistoffelees I have ever seen!  He pulls off the character very well, making adorable faces the entire time as my fave kitty :)  Michael Gruber's voice is amazing, I even started crying when I heard him sing the song &quot;Old Deuteronomy&quot;.  The Rum Tum Tugger (John Partiage) is the best I have ever seen, all attitude and so hilarous!  Jennyanydots is so much fun to watch during her song, she has the puuurfect facial expressions as a cat!  The dynamic duo, Mungojerrie (Drew Varley) and Rumpleteazer (Jo Gibb) are so much fun to watch during the entire video.  Their crazy antics during the show is the main comic relief.  Ken Page as Old Deteronomy was MADE for that part!  Overall, I was really impressed with this job well done.  Only bad thing is that they cut out &quot;Growltiger's Last Stand&quot;!  What's with that?!?  That is one of the best songs on the soundtrack!  Also, they cut short Jacob Brent's Mr. Mistoffelees dance!  Sorry, that is a crime against our beloved Jacob!  I want to see him twirl like he does on Broadway! Those are my only complaints though.  :)
0131103628|5.0|The only language I really learnt from a single book was C, and the main reason is the Kernighan-Ritchie great classic. It is written in a most intelligent way: it grabs your attention not by silly jokes, but by genuinely interesting (if short and simple) programs. You learn C and, most important, you learn good programming habits and style. The exercises are extremely relevant and, if not exactly easy, are feasible and make you fix the ideas you were exposed to. The book has an elegance I found in no other, except for the one by Kernighan on Unix. This must be very hard to attain, otherwise other authors would have profited from the lesson.
B00000490M|5.0|&quot;Find the balance.&quot; This movie was definety in balance. I for one enjoyed every moment of it. The acting is brillent ( I should know because I'm an actor in training). Ralph Macchio (The Outsiders, Up The Acadamy, My Cousion Vinny,Too Much Sun) plays Daniel Larusso, the weakling from New Jersy who wants to learn karate to impress his new girlfriend. At the end however Daniel learns more than just karate. He learns that it is important to have balance in life and that fighting id the last answer to a problem. Like I said before the video is great. it carries and important message and will keep you feeling good all day.
B00004RF9G|5.0|The main theme of Brigadoon is a concept dear to the hearts of all hopeless romantics such as myself - \\"Love conquers all.\\" It is the story of the magical Scottish village that materializes out of the highland mists for just one day every hundred years, and thus has too little contact with the outside world to lose its simple innocence, love and peace. It is the world that many of us need. To paraphrase one of the characters, \\"When I go to sleep at night, I sometimes hear voices. I can't understand what they are saying, but sometimes I think it's the sound of the outside world. There must be many, many people out there searching for a Brigadoon.\\" If the world needed a Brigadoon in 1954, then all that I can say is that now, in the year 2001, with the present state of the world is \\"Boy, do we ever need it now!\\"  The film features arguably the two best dancers in the world, Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse, and an absolutely gorgeous musical score by Lerner & Lowe. It was nominated for three Academy Awards - for Art Decoration, Costume Design and Sound Recording. With all this going for it, one would think that everyone would be happy, but such was not the case. The main flaw that the critics, both professional and amateur, seem unable to forgive is that while the film was originally planned to be shot on location in a real Scottish village, the filming was changed to indoor sets in Hollywood. There have been various reasons given for this change; economy cuts at MGM reflecting declining public interest in musical films, a persistent rainy season in Scotland that would have impacted the shooting schedule, and that the powers at MGM felt that a Scottish village just didn't resemble a Scottish village closely enough. The real reason was probably the first of the three; indeed the last great MGM musical, Gigi, was filmed a mere four years later.  But if you can overlook the indoor sets and just let Brigadoon work its gentle magic, then you are subjected to an experience of total beauty and enjoyment. The crown jewel of the film is the dance by Kelly and Charisse to one of Lerner & Lowe's most beautiful songs, \\"The Heather on the Hill\\", which then becomes the love theme of the film, playing gently in the background when the two of them are together. Van Johnson is in perfect contrast to Kelly as his sarcastic, wisecracking friend who accepts the real world as he knows it and refuses to accept anything beyond his understanding.I have loved this movie since I first saw it many years ago, and it is my sincere hope that every hopeless romantic like me will be lucky enough to get an opportunity to see it.
0393317552|5.0|My friend Roger recommended this book to me some time ago.  I had added it to my wish list but never seemed to get around to ordering it, because I had such a tremendous pile to read already!  He thoughtfully sent me a copy as a Christmas gift, and all I can say is, &quot;Boy, Roger, this a wonderful book!  Thanks so much for sending it.&quot;  Never have I encountered such lucid reflection regarding a topic about which I thought I  knew considerable already and such an innovative approach to a familiar subject within the confines of a single written work.  I am definitely impressed.<br />  Diamond starts with the quarry,  why did some national groups overcome others in their quest for space and the wherewithal of nature; why for instance did the Spaniards conquer the Inca and the Aztec, and not the Inca and/or the Aztec the Spaniards?  It would appear self evident to most people, but when Diamond presents some of the rationales suggested by previous investigators  (superior intelligence, superior culture, etc.) it rapidly becomes obvious that it isn't quite so clear cut after all.  He knocks these theories over one by one like so many paper tigers.<br />  The author looks at the earliest evidence for human achievements in different areas, examines the potential of the environment for that achievement, then looks at other like environments where similar innovations did not arise to identify what was lacking.  Agriculture, which appears to have arisen first in the area of the Fertile Crescent, seems to have arisen in an environment wherein useable plants occurred in abundance in a climate conducive to their growth and domestication.  Furthermore, the simple stone technology and the capacity to undertake a settled existence in the area long enough for these advances to arise occurred at the same time.  In looking at each area where agriculture arose independently this appears to have been the case.  It did however require considerable time, and where ever conditions were slightly sub optimal but the region was not confined by geographical barriers, diffusion of the concept or of the actual agrarians themselves brought about the change before the indigenous population was able to create their own alternatives.  This provided advantages for one group vise a vie another.<br /> Nor is agriculture the only innovation that arose and spread on similar principles.  Pottery, writing, the wheel, draught animals, metallurgy, group structures, etc,  all seem to have arisen in response to local conditions and spread from their point of origin to surrounding areas, providing similar advantages to migrating groups.  Even crowd diseases, though hardly what one would classify an &quot;advance,&quot; arose among people who lived in close proximity to domesticated animals, becoming immune to or at least more tolerant of diseases arising from these animals.  Naive groups were therefore at risk of near total annihilation when these diseases were introduced suddenly, as native Americans, native Australians and Polynesian populations among others discovered to their great disadvantage.  In areas where non-crowd diseases occurred to which local inhabitants might be immune, the technologically &quot;superior&quot; groups often found it difficult to make headway, as for instance against malaria by Europeans attempting to take control of New Guinea.<br />  One of the more interesting of Diamond's concepts (at least to me) was his examination of the barriers that might prevent dispersal of cultural traits: especially geography, past practice, utility and ideology.  I was most impressed by his discussion of the simple concept of latitude as a promoter or inhibitor of disbursal.  Limiting  factors arose due to the human tolerance of ultraviolet light, a need for or toxicity from vitamin D, the ability of plants to adjust to different temperature, light intensity or daylight duration,  or to the seasonal fluxuation in temperature, and so forth.  His examination of the east-west verses north-south axis of orientation among the continents as a factor effecting numbers of species of plants and animals available for domestication was also informative.  Another key point, certainly one crucial to our own age of environmental mismanagement, is the importance of starting conditions and of the effects of decisions made by early people on the state of affairs of their descendants.  Large mammals that might have been used as domesticates by early Australians, New Zealanders or native Americans may have been, in fact almost certainly were in some circumstances, hunted to extinction or displaced by non-native animals introduced by early people arriving on islands and continents previously uninhabited by humans.  Their initial decisions reduced the options of their descendants in serious ways.<br /> Probably one of the most important points in Diamond's discussion is that much of what we see as &quot;primitive&quot; or &quot;backward&quot; about the indigenous cultures of some of the losers in the colonialization confrontations of the 19th and early 20th centuries were in fact a reflection of the skill, adaptiveness and creativity of earlier settlers in dealing with difficult terrains with a limited technology.  Furthermore, much of what we consider the &quot;progressive&quot; and &quot;superior&quot; characteristics of  the winners' cultures were in fact shearly the luck of the draw.<br />  In my opinion this book would make a terrific text for a course in anthropology,  history,  sociology, or political science.  Because it presents the information in a clear and simple manner, it might also be a welcome addition to a high school social science course.  I know there are several people with a variety of backgrounds who have qued up at home and at work to read my copy.  You have definitely brought it to the attention of a multitude, Roger, believe me!e, and so forth.

B000002KZA|5.0|This album deserves its just credit. Sure, it included some weak songs such as More Than a Party and Pipeline. Even the single, Love in Itself could've been made much better with some further remixing, but alas, let it be. Alan Wilder's two contributions, Two Minute Warning &amp; The Landscape is Changing are surprisingly contemporary and rhythmic. It would've been so nice if Martin Gore could have continued writing politically insightful lyrics. Told You So has to be, hands down, one of Depeche Mode's finest songs EVER! That song alone, warrants a five star rating. The album, People Are People isn't so bad either. <br />I am aware that this review is really quite &quot;all over the place,&quot; but I feel another review is needed just to bring the average rating of this album up just another half-a-star... The Arab Mix of Pipeline givesthe song the quality that it should have possessed in the firstplace. Also, the Acoustic Version of Love in Itself transforms the song into a work of pure art. There are also several remixes of Shame &amp; Told You So. People really are too critical of this album! I'm sure that if you were to ask any true Depeche Mode fan, they would love this album no matter how weak a couple of songs are.
0553106635|5.0|A fast paced book with lot's of action and one that I thoroughly enjoyed.  I recommend it highly, but for adults only.  Some of the violence, incest and possibly some of the other sex would be inappropriate for young teens (at least in my opinion).  The book is very well written and is unusual for a fantasy in that it is unpredictable and a number of well developed main characters get killed off.  A really good read.
B000005S0D|5.0|1984 I believe was a turning point for progressive rock, There is no kidding Pink Floyd in 70's crushed the rock world with The Dark side of the moon and Wish you were here but in 80's Camel hit the target by Stationary Traveller. I believe Andrew Latimer can compete with guitar legends like Jimmy Page, David Gilmour, Jimmy Hendrix, Ritchie Blackmore and Mark Knopfler but only a few people know his talent. Stationary Traveller is the one the best Camel's album and I highly recommand for anybody who loves Rock'n'roll,It is worth it Listen and enjoy!!
0679879269|5.0|I absolutly loved this book,though i thing that the 1st one was the best. Definitly worth the long wait!!!I fell in love with this book! But for all you people who feels it is offensful to your religion, IT'S JUST A BOOK!! it's not telling you to go out and do anything!
B00004VVNC|3.0|This film would get four stars from me if Julia Ormond were not in the film. Somehow she ends up in roles like this all the time... with different men fighting over her. I don't see why anyone would fight over her. Minus Ormond this film is excellent with the patriarch of the family played by an incomparable Anthony Hopkins whose forceful and important presence is felt even after his character suffers a stroke and ends up unable to speak anymore. Hopkins' character conveys the personal pain he feels over the death of the youngest son and even more reflects his pain when the middle son, and presumably the favourite (Brad Pitt) runs away. Brad Pitt plays his character with passion and conviction, and the viewer can actually feel his fraternal love as he goes to war to try to protect his younger brother from harm. You can also sense his heart being broken as he cannot save the younger brother. Also excellent in this film as the eldest brother, Aidan Quinn, who is jealous of Brad Pitt's character. Ormond plays the youngest brother's fiance. When the youngest brother dies, Ormond is caught between the affections of Quinn's character and Pitt's character. Ormond loves Pitt but not Quinn. Pitt eventually leaves again and travels around the world losing himself while also trying to find himself. After years pass, Ormond eventually marries Quinn's character. Pitt returns and marries a woman he loves dearly and has children with her. The strained relations between Ormond, Quinn as her husband, and Pitt are actually very well done by all three actors. The film would perhaps like to be a love story, but more sweepingly it succeeds as a story about families and their internal problems and personality conflicts and how they deal with pain and loss.
6302902010|5.0|THE 1959 VERSION OF PORGY &amp; BESS IS BY FAR THE GREATEST MUSICAL PERFORMANCE I'VE EVER SEEN. IF ANYONE HAVE ANY INFORMATION WHERE I CAN GET A COPY OF THIS EXCELLENT PROGRAM, PLEASE E-MAIL ME AT big_reggie_2000@yahoo.com.
B00002E285|4.0|Bob Geldof is superb here. All the more so because he is not an actor. This is a disturbing movie which gave all my friends nightmares after they saw it. I watched it because I was a fan of Geldof. I have never been the biggest Pink Floyd fan, although I can appreciate their body of work. The story of this film is intriguing. There is no dialogue... just a lot of disturbing cartoon footage among the story of a drugged out musician (Pink, played by Geldof). The film is a more musical and visual than it is a film of drama or words. For more insight you might consider reading Geldof's autobiography, the excellent Is That It? Otherwise just watch the film.
B000003CMB|5.0|It's hard to imagine this album is 30 years old.  Still after all these years arguably the greatest album in the history of rock and roll.  Brilliant improvisation, passionate singing, everything you could ask for in music.  The Allmans have been described as a jazz band that plays the blues.  This album bears it out.  Equal parts T-Bone Walker and John Coltrane, Bobby Bland and Miles Davis, the band makes all the current talk of jam bands just so much hot air.<br />The album starts with a more traditional take on the blues with Statesboro Blues, Done Somebody Wrong and Stormy Monday.These show the depth of the bands understanding of blues both n the recasting of Blind Willie McTell's Statesboro and the relatively traditional reading of Stormy Monday, although the solo's go places most blues bands would fear to tread unless they are covering the Allmans.  You Don't Love Me transitions into the extended pieces taking a blues format and stretching it beyond recognition.  Hot Lanta burns intensely and Elizabeth Reed takes the band to the land of jazz and rock. The familiar crunch of Whipping Post concludes the journey to the nether reaches of improvisational excellence.<br />If you don't own this-shame on you.  If you are over 40 and don't own two or three copies in multiple formats-where have you been.  A Must have.
6304080921|4.0|Brad Pitt, Bruce Willis and Madeleine Stowe are all excellent in this quirky, offbeat film which is told in a roundabout fashion. By the end the story becomes clear to the viewer, but throughout the film twists and turns confuse you and make sure that you are not quite sure of what you are seeing. Brad Pitt is exquisite here in a crazy role that was definitely unexpected. This is another of those films that is difficult to describe and is best just seen.
B00000J2KT|5.0|So the first question you may ask is: &quot;Why is this the greatest war movie ever?&quot;. Well, the truth is that other movies catch a lot of the battles and the persons in the battle and their feelings. But this movie starts at the academy, where they are trained to be killers. You see how each individual is when they start their training, and you see how they change. This movie is filled with lots of humour that isn't really supposed to be humouristic in the movie.<br />As one of the few that has also read the book by Gustav Hasford, the movie is quite a lot shorter but it captures the tough moments very well. You will truly feel the pain with the characters as you watch this movie. The main person, The Joker, has a lot of fun remarks, and the gunnery sergeant is even wittier. I really bought this movie only because of the academy and it's funny remarks and humour, but you get so much more. On the battlefield you have the truly fearsome scenes, and the truly funny and beautiful scenes. You will feel for the Joker. My only advice to you is to get this movie, not only if you like war movies, cause it's as much a humouristic movie as it's a fearsome war movie.
6302648750|3.0|Bruce Willis is the true surprise of this movie. He plays a very nerdy plastic surgeon who has relationships with both Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn's characters. Both women end up taking a potion that gives them eternal life and youth/beauty, but when they each take the potion, they do not consider the long-term or negative effects of it. They carry on a virtual war with one another and end up literally falling apart. The first time I saw this film I was a bit stunned by it and not at all entertained, but after I saw it again I realized it was a good concept with a highly talented cast and indeed a highly talented special effects crew. The effects alone are worth watching. Also, as I said, Willis is surprising in this role... and very entertaining as the tortured man between these two bitter enemies (Hawn and Streep). In the end these women end up having to befriend one another, begrudgingly, because they share this miserable eternal life. The film captures the contemporary American craze to defy your age and do anything you can to stave its onset. Vanity and a competitive need to look beautiful and young long after you are no longer young is explored to ridiculous extremes in this film and really makes you think about self-esteem and beauty in American society.
B00003CWTI|5.0|This movie is worth seeing, simply because you have never seen anything like it.  Anderson jumps from story to story, weaving a quilt that casts a sad spell over the viewer. I think Anderson is trying to bring you his vision of life: it's painful, we do things we regret and can never take back, happiness is elusive but should be grabbed where it can and a few caring people can make a difference in the lives of others.<br />I liked this movie much more the second time I saw it.  The first time it was a bit hard to make sense of - all the story lines, the weird intro about coincidences and, of course, the frogs.  The second time I saw it I had digested the style and come to appreciate it and could concentrate a little more on the stories.  There is also the wonderful Aimee Mann soundtrack - I became an Aimee Mann fan as a result of hearing her in this movie.  There are some snippets of dialogue that come right out of the Aimee Mann songs.
B000053NYB|4.0|Denzel Washington is his intense and spectacular self in this film about injustice and wrongful imprisonment and tampering with evidence, among other injustices that take place all the time. Films like this are infuriating and should be viewed. Even if the movie is overly long and some parts unnecessary, this tells a true story and exposes the truth that justice can be blind and facts conveniently overlooked. As pointed out in the movie Arlington Road, people feel more safe when they think perpetrators of a crime have been apprehended and convicted. No need to worry about that anymore. This film tells the story of Ruben \\"the Hurricane\\" Carter who was a champion boxer before he was arrested for and convicted of murder. He spent the majority of his adult life in prison, losing appeal after appeal, until finally a group of people in Canada discover his story, visit him, and decide they are not leaving until Carter is acquitted. Eventually their efforts pay off, but you cannot help but feel angry to see how much of his life was spent needlessly behind bars. And it inevitably leads you to think about the justice system and how many people are wrongfully convicted all the time whether because of corruption of the system or simply by mistake. Or how many people are put to death wrongfully? Films like this are important for the value of the thoughts and hopefully actions they provoke in thoughtful viewers.
006097625X|4.0|&quot;Understanding Comics&quot; by Scott McCloud is a real eye-opener. I have spent as much time reading comics as the next guy, but I have never thought of the theories and principles behind the medium. The book takes the reader on a spectacular journey through the underlying structure of comics, and although I don't share all of McCloud's views I have certainly gained a whole new awareness of this structure.<br />One can always nit-pick, of course. McCloud seems to have a closer relationship to pictures than to words, and his analysis of the pictorial component of comics is much more thorough than that of the literal one. He also claims that no other medium makes its receiver into such an active co-creator, since the reader of comics must fill in the &quot;blanks&quot; between the panels, but I believe that the reader of prose is even more active - when there are no sounds or pictures AT ALL, the receiver has to imagine EVERYTHING himself. There are a few obscurities as well, as when McCloud says &quot;language&quot; but seems to mean &quot;writing system&quot;. These and other complaints are all about details, however, and doesn't alter the fact that the work as such is very good.
630398021X|2.0|Despite the brilliant portrayal of a tough-as-nails limo driver delivered by Angela Bassett and the passably deceptive portrayal as confidant and friend turned surprise villain given by Tom Sizemore, this movie cannot really be saved. I know a few people who find this to be a really brilliant film, and while it does bring up some interesting and even controversial issues it wallows too much in its own self-importance and pretension. Ralph Fiennes is just too wooden to be believable in his role as Lenny, a \\"dealer\\" of some sort of futuristic virtual reality recordings. (Apparently these \\"recordings\\"-whose name escapes me at the moment-are quite addictive and quite illegal. They are actual recordings of events from the perspective of the person wearing a device on their heads. The viewer then wears a similar device to view the recordings from the point of view of the recorder. The viewer also feels what the recorder was feeling. This makes for some rather disturbing recordings and, worse yet, viewings). Juliette Lewis turns in a skanky portrayal of Faith, the singer with whom Lenny is eternally obsessed. The film is not altogether unviewable, although it can tire the nerves at times.
B000001BX0|5.0|A must have in your collection.  Aggressive, fresh, exciting.
080018789X|5.0|The first time I saw this movie, I had heard all the hype. I heard how great it supposedly was, and I actually believed some of that hype. I watched it intently but never quite figured out what made it so bloody great. Yeah, it was good, the story was nice, and the performances were mint. However this movie was one of the sort that I just had to see twice to fully appreciate. And appreciate it I did. I suddenly saw how close to real life the characters' interactions were. I saw a beautiful relationship between single mother and little son, and indeed between single mother and her older and protective sister. I saw a shallow, hollow guy (Cruise) become a whole person (not without a lot of ups and downs and bumps in the road). I saw a lovely relationship between Cuba Gooding Jr.'s character and his wife. I saw greed at its worst and of course, in the happy ending, I saw personal connections and commitments overcome some of the effects of greed. Described this way, the film sounds almost too sappy, but it isn't. The story is quite subtle and very realistic. Tom Cruise turns in a splendid performance as the title character; Rene Zellweger was the perfect actress for the part of Dorothy Boyd because she is beautiful but not too beautiful and possesses a charming and unspoiled quality that was perfect for the character and for the tone of the picture.  Gooding, Jr. was excellent and his work in a supporting role was honored with an Academy Award. I think this film will satisfy any longing for a real but not depressing film about the nature of love, commitment, relationships, and simple human interaction.
0789723107|5.0|Excellent book.  Well written; concise, illustrative, and to the point.  No fluff, just a great guide to help with usability testing without overwhelming you.  Much more useful than Jakob Nielson's &quot;Designing Web Usability&quot;--pound for pound.
B00000IO4I|4.0|The actors in this film are grand. The virtually unknown (to American filmgoing audiences) Jane Horrocks (she plays the character in live theatre as well) is brilliant as the silent, shy, and introverted Little Voice. She never talks (and is even too afraid to answer the telephone), but sometimes, as if possessed by the souls of larger-than-life stars like Judy Garland, Little Voice is able to sing and imitate these stars. Her nagging and ungrateful mother, played by a talented but always appropriately annoying Brenda Blethyn, is jealous of Little Voice, treats her horribly, and resents the relationship LV (as she is referred to) shared with her father. Michael Caine is excellent as Blethyn's sleazy date who comes home with her and \\"discovers\\" this goldmine that is LV's voice and talent. Blethyn grows more and more jealous of Caine's interest in her daughter. Caine convinces LV to perform live (which will, presumably, make her-and him-rich). Caine uses LV's dead father as a ploy to get her onstage, and for one night, she discards her shyness and her fears and gives the performance of a lifetime. Caine sees the profit growing in his imagination and books many more occasions for LV to sing, but she refuses to perform ever again. Blethyn's character grows more and more bitter. Eventually their house burns down, and LV leaves to be with a shy telephone repairman and pigeon-keeper played well by Ewan McGregor who has quietly been pursuing LV all along. The film is delightful for its offbeat charm, although it is a somewhat sad tale for Blethyn and Caine's characters. But the overall story of how LV finds her true voice and breaks out of her shell is rewarding.
6302732875|5.0|Once every five or ten years you see a great movie on TV that you didn't even know was in the theaters.  This is one of them.  If you liked Patterns and Executive Suite you'll like this movie.  If you're looking for Die Hard or The Maltese Falcon move on.
B000056K04|4.0|I recently downloaded all of Everday from Napster (don't worry I am going to buy it also).  All of my friends are hardcore Dave Matthews fans (and I guess you could consider me as one as well), but they hate the new single, &quot;I Did It&quot;.  But I think that they're going to be in for a shock when they purchase the album.  Here it is, base none of your judgement of what the album is going to sound like from its' first single.  Even though Dave sticks with the electric guitar for about 3/4 of the cd, no song sounds like I Did It, even though I love that song.  What the cd is, is a compliation of some of the most involved tunes I've ever heard.  What producer Glen Ballard did was mix Dave's orginal sound roots from his Under the Table Years and mixed them with the best parts of Crash and then blended it with the melancholy melodies of Before These Crowded Streets.  Then he threw in a heavy pop influence and out came Everday.  It features (literally) the best song I have ever heard in my entire life, Angel.  And other great tunes like What You Are (sounds like The Last Stop and Minarets), The Space Between (trying too much to sound like Crash (Into Me) but still a valiant effort and probably the next single, When the World Ends, So Right (great song that reminds me of Say Goodbye but doesn't really sound like it, don't ask), If I Had It All (reminiscant of every song on Before These Crowded Streets mixed together), and Fool To Think which I hated the first time I heard it, and now think that it's unbelieveable.  All in all, the album is most likely Matthews' most innovative and original.  I would have given it five stars, but Leroi's sax is barely heard on the album, and that's it only real downfall.  Otherwise, fantastic album.
0140277447|5.0|This is a great introductory book for those who are interested in learning about atrocities committed by Japanese soldiers during the World War II.  The Rape of Nanking was one of the most hideous war crimes ever committed in the 20th century, which has been a taboo to discuss in public--particularly in Japan--for many years.<br />The book tells the gruesome tale of brutality committed against Chinese civilians in the ancient Chinese city of Nanking under the Japanese occupation.  Chang brilliantly recreates the terrifying event by offering the personal accounts of those who survived the ordeal, along with numerous facts and evidence.  Well researched and eloquently argued, Chang successfully brings this &quot;forgotten holocaust&quot; back to life.<br />Although the journalistic writing style of Chang may not please students of history, she effectively conveys to readers the terror of rape and genocide orchestrated by Japanese soldiers.  This is the book that everyone--particularly the Japanese--needs to read, in order to learn and preserve the truth for those who perished under the Japanese occupation. <br />The Rape of Nanking was a disturbing event which should never have happened.  As a Japanese who grew up in postwar Japan, I am deeply disturbed by this enormity committed by my fellow countrymen.  What is more disturbing, however, is the categorical denial of the truth not only by right-wing bigots but also by many scholars and politicians who hold respectable positions in government and academia. Their unrelenting effort to hide the truth has not only undermined our effort to bury the ghost of our militarist past, but our credibility as a nation committed to the promotion and maintenance of peace in the postwar world.  If more people read this book, the truth will eventually undermine their cowardly act.  For that, I recommend everyone to read this book.<br />For Japanese, this is not an easy book to read.  Truth hurts, and it is never easy to accept the factthat our nation committed such a hideous crime.  But denial does not bring comfort to those who suffered the consequences of our action, no matter how remotely related to the incident we may be today on individual basis.  It is our moral obligation to ease the pain of victims by whatever means necessary, and the acceptance of truth accompanied by clear public apology is the first step that our nation can take.  We should be ashamed of the fact that we have denied (or been ignorant to) the truth for more than 60 years.  That shame will become even greater, if we keep denying the truth and refuse to utter three simple words--&quot;We are sorry.&quot;
6305531412|5.0|For such a great film the DVD to it was disappointing.  NO extras.  The movie is only 13 years old.  There could have been such extras to put on the disc.  Disney needs to go to extras school.
B00000JRTX|3.0|This was a very good movie.  Hugh Grant is charming and funny in a clumsy way.  Andie MacDowell is cute and charming as well.  The cast as a whole is terrific.  I recommend this movie to all. The DVD on the other hand, was very poor.  I have watched a lot of DVDs in the past year and this was one of the worst.  I felt like I was watching a VHS tape.  The picture was very bland and the colors were muted.  I know the English are pale, but this DVD transfer did not do them any justice.  On top of the poor video quality, the sound was just as awful.  The volume was very low, and jumpy at times.  The dialog at times didn't come through clearly and there was no use of the surround channels.  This movie could use a thorough update to the entire pakage.  A new video transfer, a new audio 5.1 channel mix and some extras would have made this a top DVD.  Instead MGM decided to skip all the goodies technology has to offer to keep the price of this DVD down.  Too Bad, Its a Great Movie.

B000056JYB|4.0|It is hard not to look back at the line-up of this short-lived 1969 Supergroup and think about what might have been: Eric Clapton, Steve Winwood and Ginger Baker.  Certainly Blind Faith had the potential to be more than a Cream substitute with Winwood replacing Jack Bruce.  However, after their debut album and a single U.S. tour, Clapton was off with Delaney and Bonnie before making his first attempt at a solo effort.  This Deluxe Edition from Universal Classics consists of a remastered edition of &quot;Blind Faith&quot; and some unreleased cuts (e.g., a slow downed blues version of &quot;Sleeping in the Ground&quot;) and a second disc of jam sessions that never really get beyond the raw stage.  You will find them interesting but there is nothing there that approaches either &quot;Presence of the Lord&quot; or &quot;Can't Find My Way Home.&quot;  I admit this surprises me since I have always assumed that listening to Clapton jam with anybody, let alone Windwood and Baker, would be totally awesome.  So I am definitely in the first disc 5 stars, second disc 3 stars, split the difference and call it 4 star camp.
079072961X|5.0|An excellant film.  As a 21 year fan &amp; collector of Harrison's this is perfect.  He deserved an Oscar nomination for it.  This film made me a fan for Tommy Lee Jones, who did deserve his Oscar.

6305358567|1.0|Driven by a recent bought of the flu to rummage through my video library, I recently watched this movie again.  My initial impression that the film was historical mush was mightily confirmed.<br /><br />There is no historical reality to the characters, especially to the character of Elizabeth who, by the time in which the movie begins, was already a shrewd and wily politician, who had managed to survive two serious plots against both her brother, Edward VI and her sister, Mary I, in which she was implicated.  she was definitely not a naive innocent, needing complete guidance.  In addition, the damage to such characters as Burghley, who, instead of being the shrewd lawyer and politician in his 40s,as he was, is shown as a fussy, doddering old man, or Walsingham, who in reality was a very sober, strict Bible believing Puritan, and is shown as a homosexual murderer.  Indeed, if I were one of their descendents I would sue the producers!<br /><br />There is no logic to the plot, which not only telescopes time in the usual manner of historical films (i.e., jamming 20 years into 1, going forward), but even telescopes past into present.  Add to that the dimly lit sets (in which nearly all interiors appear to have been filmed in Durham Cathedral) and the often odd camera angles and any plot rationality is lost, although there was little of it in any case.<br /><br />The overall effect is one of historical gibberish.  About the best thing I can say is that a handful of scenes are at least somewhat evocative and suggest that the costumers did make an effort at doing the historical research which the writers, director and producer clearly did not.  (This is most prominent in the coronation scene in which Elizabeth's costume closely resembles an illumination in, I believe, the charter of the London barber-surgeons.)

B000002AH7|5.0|Writing about &quot;jazz&quot; suffers from the breadth of definition of the word.  Jazz performances  range from the smoke-filled back street bar to vast concert halls.  Those venues offer  opportunity for highly innovative techniques suited to changing audiences through tightly  structured presentations to black-tied audiences.  Miles is nearly unique in his ability to reach  across such varied scenarios, delivering stunning performances of universal appeal.  Sketches  of Spain is &quot;listenable&quot; in nearly any circumstance.  The performance is stunning and almost  unmatched by even the best of his other albums.  Miles Davis brings a level of musical  discipline rarely heard in jazz musicians.  Every note on these pieces is precise, clearly chosen  for its value to the total performance.  Don't confuse precision with sterility, however.  This  music soars far too grandly to be listened to as a clinical exercise.  Davis easily conveys the  listener on tonal flights reflecting the vast scope of his talents.  His range sweeps over us,  making the performance seem extemporaneous, when in fact it resulted from intense effort to  produce exactly the right sequence of phrases.<br />Davis' move into the classical shocked those who believed jazz as a special form of  Americana.  His choice of the Aranjuez, a deeply moving Spanish composition, is particularly  suited to his talents.  Davis performances may be called &quot;brass blues&quot; from his ability to  &quot;swing low&quot; with his cornet.  He achieves a phenomenal range with it, managing the feat  without imparting the metallic overtones a trumpeter often conveys.  He produces sounds  with this instrument that can only be compared with the best of human voices.  For example,  listen to any of Montserrat Figueras' CDs for both the Spanish origins of this music and the  purity of tone matched by Davis.<br />This early collaboration with Gil Evans eventually led Davis down a path some of couldn't  follow.  Sketches of Spain, however, is a masterpiece of Davis' best and under the still gently  guiding hand of Evans.  This is one of Davis monumental efforts, not requiring you to be an  admirer of Davis or a jazz aficionado, but simply someone willing to be enthralled by fine  music.etches of Spain, however, is a masterpiece of Davis' best and under the still gently  guiding hand of Evans.

B00004T37H|5.0|I just starting about a year ago to go into other anime other than DragonBall Z.  I've seen DragonBall, DragonBall Z, DragonBall GT, and some of the new DragonBall episodes just coming out in Japan.  I've also seen Blue Sub 6, Gundam 0080, Gundam Wing, Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz, Tenchi Muyo, Tenchi Universe, Tenchi in Tokyo, (some Sailor Moon to kill time), and Outlaw Star, and am now searching for new anime to watch.  This was my first pick that I found to rent.  This is one of the best anime I have ever seen.  Of course, I'd rather watch it in Japanese with English subtitles than English dubbed.  I would recommend this to all beginner and moderate anime fans out there.  I can't speak for true anime fans since I have not gone as far with it as others have.  In short, this is a must have.
B00003CXE7|5.0|I got my DVD player just to get this film.  A smart move I must say.  I write this 4 days after the Oscar nominations. Great film, the box office hit Russell needed.  Just did not like the story between the brother &amp; sister characters.  Could have done without that.  Excellant extras!!
B00002E23E|5.0|I had never seen a concert film before, but after seeing this one, I feel that no others will ever favorably match up! The live performance is unbelievable, Bonham's hard-hitting drums, Jones' phat bass, Page's GODLIKE guitar playing and Plant's emotion-filled vocals make this the best live performace package I have ever heard/seen. Particularly notable tracks are &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; with its myriad of speeds and styles, let alone Page's intense, scorching solo and of course the guitar/violin bow combination, the classic &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; where Page again blows away everyone in MSG with an outstanding solo and Plant's voice puts the crowd in a angelic state of mind, and of course &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; with its intense sexual overtones and overall quality performance. The fantasy scenes are engaging and lend an insight into the minds of Led Zeppelin. My particular favorite is Plant's Celtic fantasy. This is a film that must be watched in its entirety to get the full effect, no skipping of fantasy scenes. This film is an essential must-have for any Zep fan or fan of classic rock!
B00001QEE5|5.0|One of my favorite Disney films.  Love the music &amp; Tinkerbell is one of my favorite characters.  No extras on the disc though. Disney is famous for that.  Great picture quality &amp; love the music.
B000000OU4|5.0|This is one of my favorite Jazz CD's. If there is one Jazz musician that truly is unique and talented, &quot;Pat Metheny&quot; certainly fits the bill. From the very first song on this CD, Metheny takes us through various complex and emotional compositions that pleases throughout. My personal favorite &quot;To the End of the World.&quot; is haunting but satisfying with fabulous guitar work from Metheny and keyboard compositions from Lyle Mays. You get the impression that Metheny is on a musical level that few will ever achieve in contempory jazz music today.
B00001QEBQ|5.0|I did not think I would like this film.  It turned out great. Not the best, but well done.  Excellant music &amp; I loved Eddie Murphy's character.  Disney did do a good job on this DVD, some extras &amp; great picture quality.
B00004UEDQ|2.0|My actual rating for this film would be 2.5 stars.   <br />  The film was based on a woman who was sentenced to an Addictions Center by the Court. The most talented actor in the film, Steve Buscemi had a comparitively small roll.  You tend to want to compare it to Michael Keaton's 'Clean and Sober', but in reality there is no comparison which is disappointing. All in all a very forgetable film. The Theatrical trailers had little to offer as far as insight.  Just Actors and Directors patting each other on the back.<br />  If you want to see a film that explores this type of content with a little more realism and understanding of a complex subject, purchase Clean &amp; Sober.

0553108034|5.0|A fantastic follow-up to A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings delves even deeper into this densly populated story.  George R. R. Martin set the foundation with the first volume and with the second he has teasingly revealed some of the motivations behind the deeds in the first book.  Readers are given a much closer look at what is driving some of these characters and there is also additional information on the characters that were only mentioned in the first book but seemed to be left out.<br />As I believe Martin himself has stated, the first book, while filled with many characters, did tend to focus on Ned Stark.  A Clash of Kings is where the fans of the series get to find out just how devious Tyrion Lannister can be.  While Tyrion may be shorter than most, his actions make him twice as tall.<br />The chaotic stampede to name kings and sieze thrones created by the characters' actions in the first volume, comes to a titantic confrontation in A Clash of Kings.  And yet, all of the various competitors still have not taken the field, which will keep readers hungry to devour more of the story in the next volumes.<br />Martin is doing a wonderful job with this epic power struggle.
B00004R99J|5.0|I was prepared not to like this film.  I ended up loving it.  It is certainly not the best Disney film but it is great.  Excellant music.  Better than average Disney DVD.  A few extras on it.

B0000041Q3|5.0|Two Prima Donna Assolutas and one Primo Tenore. You will never get a cast like this again. That's why this truely legendary recording has sold more than just about every other operatic set. Joan Sutherland approaching 50 years old with still the most luscious rich spinto soprano sound ever and high notes like a trumpet sings Turandot to conquer all others. Monserrat Caballe, the great Spanish diva will make you melt with her bel canto singing. Luciano Pavorotti, the Primo tenore of the last 30 or so years is ideal as the Prince Calaf, topping all the high C's and B's with his usual sweet ringing tenor. I think this one ranks as one of all time greats in recording history.

B000059T1E|5.0|Whittled down to a trio Traffic solidered on with their finest album. Although not as catchy or commerical as their first two studio albums, JBMD captures the trio at their best. The music smoothly moves from folk to jazzy instrumentals without breaking a sweat. Winwood's vocals are among his best here. His impassioned vocals on Every Mother's Son bring the album to life.<br />Originally intended as a Steve Winwood solo album Capaldi and Wood offered their services during the recording of the album. The songs and playing meshed so well that Winwood, Capaldi and Wood decided to revive the Traffic name.<br />The remastering supervised by Bill Levenson is spectacular. Levenson always makes sure that there is considerable care put into all the projects he supervises. The sound is actually superior to the UK counterpart released last year. Levenson's version of JBMD doesn't sound as overprocessed as the British version of the album.<br />A couple of minor complaints about the UK release are, for the most part, taken care of on the US release. Although the song fragment I Just Want To Know is interesting why was it put in the middle of the UK release? It threw off the flow of the original album and actually detracted from the quality of it as well.<br />The bonus tracks are a fine addition to this already great album. The sound quality is great. The booklet informative but doesn't suffer from overkill.

0944379044|1.0|It is a horrendous mistake to ban Adolph Hitler's evil manifesto -Mein Kampf- written about a decade before the dictator came to power. Well meaning censors are indeed right in prudentially warning immature minds to be cautious.  One most certainly should not offer -Mein  Kampf- to a child.  This book, however, allows us to more fully understand the mindset of the Nazi leader who unleashed pure hell upon the  world.  We must remember that Hitler wrote this work in 1924 during his incarceration in Landberg Am Lech Prison.  Few believed this  minor league figure had a political future.  The Nazis were mostly perceived to be a collection of losers, a fanatical fringe group that need not  be taken seriously.  Hitler and his goons were not feared as much as ridiculed. The American journalist William Shirer, for instance, recalled  the barroom fellowship of colleagues who made fun of the Nazis.  Charlie Chaplin even did a comedy routine imitating the mannerisms of  Hitler.<br />Adolph Hitler was not subtle and discrete.  The charismatic Fuehrer readily indulged in pseudoscientific jargon to convey an intellectual  authority to support his lunatic theories.  Chapter XI of Volume I entitled &quot;Nation and Race&quot; wherein the Nazi leader charged Jews with  &quot;poisoning&quot; the German race alone should have alerted the world.  Democracy was viewed as nothing more than a swindle perpetuated by  the weaker races to defeat the master German elite.  The enemy of my enemy is my friend is how many justified their awkward and uneasy  alliances with the Nazis.  Hitler's contempt for Russian Communism encouraged these people to naively let down their guard.  This was  especially true of those religious adherents of the Roman Catholic and Lutheran Protestant traditions. It was not all that unusual to find individuals who dismissed Hitler's vile utterances as nothing more than exaggerated tongue in cheek rhetoric.  The at least metaphorical reality of  Original Sin guarantees that Adolph Hitler will regrettably not be the last of his kind.  We need to study -Mein Kampf- to guide us concerning  similar dangers that will forevermore threaten humankind.  Should -Mein Kampf- be prominently displayed in one's personal library?  I  will not disparage others of laudable intentions who boldly place this book in public view, but I've long ago personally decided that a more  fitting place is in the back of my garage.  The legitimate study of Nazism does not seem to me to require a constant blatant reminder of  Hitler's diabolical era.  Remembering history so as not to repeat it is one thing.  Nevertheless, allowing it to dominate every waking moment is  also not wise.  A spiritual and psychological balance must be maintained.that Adolph Hitler will regrettably not be the last of his kind.

068485743X|3.0|If you know much about writing at all--if you've taken courses or published anything or read other good books-- this book probably won't be very useful to you.  I was attracted by the title and the fact that it was written by an agent but got very little from it on WRITING--the most interesting aspect was that it was an agent's point of view and it told something about why manuscripts are rejected, but it was mostly obvious stuff I already knew.  The whole first two-thirds of the book has pointers like don't have misspellings or a messy manuscript or use too many adverbs or draw on your manuscript or write grammatically incorrect sentences that are hard to follow. As other reviewers have noted, the examples are often blatant and laughable: they illustrate the obvious about melodrama and boring dialogue, for example--like, who wouldn't know, \\"I can't pay the rent.  You must pay the rent\\" should be avoided?<br /><br />What I, as a writer, need is more specifics and finer distinctions about what distinguishes good writing from poor,--more substance-- and this book taught me very little about that.  Far better is SELF EDITING FOR FICTION WRITERS, by two professional editors who understand good writing and know how to give pointers and lessons on how to achieve it, or HOW TO WRITE A DAMN GOOD NOVEL, for an understanding on structure and drama vs. melodrama, or NARRATIVE FICTION, a classic textbook used in colleges around the country.  I notice most the reviewers here who liked the book seem to be non-writers--i.e. the lawyer fraternity brother--or beginners who need to know to double space, use one-inch margins, and not write dialogue that is hard to follow.  Unless you fall into one of those groups, you might be better off with another text.
6305807043|1.0|Ok.  The premise is interesting.  That's the reason I watched this movie in the first place.  However, the execution leaves a whole lot to be desired.  I don't want to ruin the movie for anyone who still wants to see it, but I will say that I was surprised at how poorly some of the actors acted in this movie, especially Cameron Diaz.  The movie also takes far too long to get anywhere and when it does, you're left wondering how much better this movie could have been with a stronger script.  I know that Roger Ebert said this was the best movie of 1999 (it says so right on the box), but he really missed the boat on this one.
068818071X|3.0|&quot;Rachel's Holiday&quot; was an enjoyable read, but was not at all what I expected.  It certainly lacked the lightheartedness of both &quot;Watermelon&quot; and &quot;Lucy Sullivan&quot;, but I still found Rachel to be a likeable, well-developed character.<br />The most disappointing thing about this book to me was the ending -- I found it contrived and much too cute, considering the gravity of the situation covered throughout the novel.  It was unrealistic and ended the book on a disappointing note.
B000003TAR|5.0|Most people say that 'Nevermind' was the best Nirvana album. I disagree. In Utero has to be one of the most incredible albums of all times. It kicks off with the extremely catchy 'Serve the Servants' with great lyrics like 'if she floats than she is not, a witch like we thought' a great rock slightly pop punk song. Then there is 'Scentless Apprentice' a wailing shreaking metal song, with slow beats, its incredible, very exhilarating. 'Heart Shaped Box' is unlike anything I have ever heard, incredible lyrics and its catchy. 'Rape Me', the track that seemed to cause a lot of contriversy, I especially love him shreaking at the end. 'Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle' has such good lyrics 'i miss the comfort in being sad'. Though 'Dumb' has some of my favourite lyrics of all time, this sweet romantic song about thinking you may be dumb, because you're happy. 'Very Ape' isn't one of my favourites, but its good. 'Milk It' is the perfect grunge song with great lyrics and more whailing and whispering (i love it when he shrieks) 'Pennyroyal Tea', seems to be about wanting to abort oneself of the impurities, a really great song. 'Radio Friendly Unit Shifter' is not exactly radio friendly, but great with lyrics like 'love you for what i am not, did not want what i had got'. 'Tourette's' the whailing punk grunge song is just, so much fun, its great. 'All Apoligies' though has to be my favourite track off the album, and one of my favourite songs ever. It has the most beautiful lyrics and everytime I listen to it, it makes me feel a different way, sometimes it makes me want to break down and cry, other times it shows me how beautiful the world truly can be and i'm smiling away singing. In Utero is an incredible masterpiece with grunge and punk and rock and pop and its all so well rounded and well polished with great lyrics and the band members talent all brought together.

Second, spectators of the duet cheers everytime the gladiator wins his duet, but remain calm after his last duet. I personally prefer sigh after cheer for this scene.
6304826133|4.0|STALLONE is the sheriff of a small town in NEW JERSEY where corruption reigns among the cops who thinks the sheriff is dumb and will let go everything.Having flunked the test to become a cop because of his ear,SYLVESTER finds out by himself with the help of international investigator DE NIRO that GARRISON is actually infested with rats among the force.The film ends up in true western way in a bloody slow mow shoot up that has STALLONE and LIOTTA ,the only non corrupt cop ,winning the battle against the villains.The ending is a beauty since STALLONE who by now knows too much is being shot in his ear and must procedes without hearing anything.Entertaining.
0380730367|5.0|I  read this Lehane book first and went directly to the store and bought his others. Lehane's books show a real darkside of human nature and are a bit disturbing  but the way the main character, Patrick Kenzie fights the depravity makes up for it.  He is tired of his fight against evil and the way it has jaded him. He will continue it though as he feels it is his duty and it is all he knows.  He has many personal demons and his kind of sarcastic take on things is likeable. I enter a whole different world when I pick up a Dennis Lehane book.  Patrick Kenzie is a rough but honorable man on his search for justice- much more than an average private investigator.
B00000JLWW|3.0|'Titanic' was quite the phenomenon when it came out.  There is no movie that I can think of, at least in my lifetime, that became the cultural event that it did.  There were many concerns within the film community that the film was going to be a disaster.  James Cameron had spent a long time finishing the film and it was the most costly film ever made.  Many people thought it was bring an end to his career.  All these concerns and predictions were shattered when 'Titanic' came out; it became the highest grossing movie ever and it won more Academy awards than any other movie.  It skyrocketed the careers of both Kate Winslet and Leo DiCaprio.  I went to the theatres to see it with family and friends.  It was an incredible experience and several people around me were crying.  There were very few movie I had ever seen before that had mesmerized me as much as this movie did.<br /><br />I watched this movie in its entirety for the first time in years.  The reaction is much different now and the film seems much less impressive.  First of all, the graphics in 'Titanic' have not aged well.  When the ship is sinking, the CGIs look really fake and dated.  Also, the model ship they used doesn't look very good either.  It looks cheap and like it was made out of plastic!  This does not surprise me because most film do not age well; a new generation of film lovers will not find certain films as impressive as the last generation.  Putting that aside, the story of 'Titanic' is not that bad.  I think most people know what the story is about so I do not need to explain it.  The acting is slighly above average, but the screenplay is so cliched and corny, I can understand the acting did not need to be that impressive.  The last forty minutes of the film consists of the two main characters shouting, \\"Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack!  Rose, Rose, Rose, Rose!\\"  They must love each other so much that they can't think of anything else to say.<br /><br />I don't think 'Titanic' is destined to become a classic.  Even though it made so much money and won so many awards, I think most people now see the movie as an embarassment.  Now that I am older and wiser, 'Titanic' just seems like a medicore film.  Pretty disappointing considering how much the movie was loved when it first came out.become a classic.

1563896656|5.0|I said in my review of Top 10 volume 1 that that was Alan Moore's first super-hero team since WildCATS.  I was forgetting this, the very wonderful League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.<br />The idea is simple: during the late Victorian and Edwardian periods, tales of heroic fiction were popular.  In this series, characters from those tales are brought together for a shared adventure.  In this volume, you can see Miss Mina Murray (from Bram Stoker's 'Dracula') leading a group consisting of Captain Nemo (&quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot; and &quot;Mysterious Island&quot;, Jules Verne), Allan Quartermain (&quot;King Solomon's Mines&quot; and lots of others, H. Rider Haggard), Dr. Hawley Griffin (&quot;The Invisible Man&quot;, H.G. Wells) and Dr. Henry Jekyll and Mr. Edward Hyde (&quot;The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot;, Robert Louis Stevenson).<br />These characters are such classics that even the most casual of readers will have heard of some of them, and if you are interested in the fiction of that period, it may well be a wonderful treat.  Asd well as these characters, the book is liberally peppered with characters from various Victorian sources, up to and including pornography!  Mr. Moore has certainly researched this one closely before applying his wonderful imagination.<br />Having said that, the art by Kevin O'Neill is certainly not completely in character with the art illustrating stories of the period, but Mr. O'Neill has toned down the style he often uses to better suit the content.<br />But wait, there's more: the volume concludes with a text story of Allan Quartermain, which features him in conjunction with Randolph Carter, John Carter and the Time Traveller (created by H.P. Lovecraft, Edgar Rice Burroughs and H.G. Wells respectively) which ties in, at least in part, with the main story.<br />I'd like to reveal the villains of the piece, but that would be telling given that the revelation is part of the story's plot!  Good choices, though.  And a very enjoyable read.
B00004SCY9|4.0|The number of tracks on this, Moloko's third full-length release, is somewhat false advertising: a handful of the tracks are more like short interludes. But, like the playful title and album cover, Moloko does not fall short of giving you something fresh to listen to. The catchy songs (like &quot;Pure Pleasure Seeker,&quot; &quot;Indigo,&quot; and &quot;The Time is Now&quot;) are rightfully funky; while other tracks have acoustic, almost bluesy tones. Either way, Roisin Murphy's soulful vocals slide over Mark Brydon's intricate programming. The wide range of instruments gives this album its uncomfortableness--but maybe just because the range (Hammond Organ, Strings, Contra Bass Sax and Contra Bassoon mixed with digital drums and loops) is so uncommon. Moby labeled this album as one of his year's Top 5, and I can see why. Although I skip through some of the less melodic tracks, I give Moloko credit for creating an album with such versitality and energy that it is hard to compare this duo to another. And even if you don't enjoy all of the tracks, the album as a whole is fun and funny, with lyrics like the choir-shouting &quot;Rameses! Colossus!&quot; and teasing &quot;You only wanna be in a garage band/You know you wanna give the gong a bang.&quot; Moloko knows how to be goofy and how to make a club hit, and makes it look easy; while there are actually two very bright talents crafting the music.
B00004XOWM|3.0|Well, Fred has outdone himself by thinking of ... lyrics ever.  Take out all the &quot;Check, Check 1,2&quot;, &quot;Limp Bizkit in the house&quot; and &quot;Chocolate starfish&quot; and you've eliminated half of the album's lyrics.  The only thing that keeps this album alive is Wes Borland hard rock rifts that, when played loud enough, can cover up Dursts repetive lyrics.  The simple backbeats laid out by DJ ... are less than exciting and most of the time can hardly be heard.  The bass lines mostly double the guitar lines, which is very dissapointing....
B00003XACV|5.0|This is my favorite cd of my whole collection, it just reaffirms a lust for life every time I listen. Just like the scene at the end of the film when he remembers bits of his life, it makes me appreciate the trees and my family and this beautiful life that we are given to live. Track 8 &quot;American Beauty&quot; is the most beautiful.
B00004X0Q0|4.0|ROC is really a great rock album. I dont know how to explain it, but the mix of Cedric's incredible vocals and the jammin' guitars make up the songs, which are too infectious for their own good. If you're a new ATDI fan, I would recommend this first, the Vaya, then In/Casino/Out, and then Acrobatic Treatment. But this is truly a great album. (PS: Memo to Mikey, the lyrics are &quot;cut away, cut away&quot; not get away, go away. And, Taproot cant compare to these guys)
B000055WIQ|5.0|I watched &quot;The Exorcist&quot; for the first time a few days ago. Until then everyone told me it was the scarriest movie they had ever seen.I'm a scaredy cat,so it took alot of guts to finally sit down and watch it. I'm glad I did,because it truly is a very scary but extrodinary movie. The movie is about a 11-year old girl named Regan who becomes possessed by a demon. There is one  scene in the movie called the &quot;spider walk&quot; you will have to see the movie to know what it is,but it is the best scene in the whole movie. The movie basically is about the fight between good and evil,but if you watch the movie you will find out that it is about so much more. I would not recommend this movie to someone who can't stand the sight of blood.This movie in my opinion is  gory. I would also not recommend this movie to anyone under the age of 18. For the rest of you who are searching for the ultimate horror movie,you can stop looking because you won't find one any scarier than &quot;The Exorcist&quot;.

B000005JA8|4.0|Being a total drooling fan of PJ Harvey, I figure if she waxes poetic about Captain Beefheart, he must be something special, right? So I order this album. I'd heard a few Beefheart clips here and there, but not enough to form an opinion. It arrives, and when I play it I am completely confused. &quot;What is this?! You call this music? Sounds like a bunch of drunks playing instruments and making up songs!&quot;, I think. I play it again the next day, hoping it would be different. It was. What seemed like a bunch of drunks randomly playing notes somehow came together. I promise I'm not on drugs. It's still one of the wierdest albums I've ever come across, but one of the best. I would still like to know what he means by &quot;fast and bulbous&quot;, though.

0679879269|2.0|This is definitely one of the more disappointing books that I have ever read.  I loved both of the first two books in this series, and was excited to discover how Mr. Pullman would answer the intriguing questions that he posed in those earlier works.<br />Unfortunately, in many cases, he does not answer them at all.<br />Unlike many of the other reviewers, I have no problem with Pullman's message about the church.  In fact, I give this book two stars instead of one, because at least it may make some teen-agers think about deeper issues.  However, I felt that after he had created such a marvelous world, he cheated his readers by leaving so many threads hanging loose.<br />As a secondary criticism, I also thought that the writing was not nearly as well done in this book.  I felt jolted by a few awkward changes in the point-of-view.  The dialog seemed much more stilted, and the character motivation far less clear.<br />Overall, I got the feeling that this series should perhaps have stretched into 4 or more books so that Mr. Pullman would have had the time to properly wrap things up.
0553212737|1.0|Having been forced to read &quot;Emma&quot; for an English Literature course, I feel that I know as much about it as anyone else, if not more so.  &quot;Emma&quot; is nothing more than a trashy romance, like the rest of Jane Austen's novels.  We all know more or less what is going to happen at the end of the book - of course the hero and heroine are going to fall in love.  Austen's use of irony is not exemplary either - is there anyone who didn't realise that Frank Churchill was hiding something, if we weren't sure quite what?  Anyone who describes an Austen novel as a &quot;classic&quot;, particualy this one, needs their head examined.  She is an olden days Jackie Collins, whose fancy language seems to have deluded some into believing that she is something which she certianly is not.
B00004Z459|5.0|I first heard with you (track 3) and was immediately hooked on Linkin Park.  As i'm not really into grunge or rock i was sursprised how quickly i found out they were my favourite group. Buy this CD it is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.
6302293553|5.0|Propably the best comedy movie of all time in my opinion,And the budget of this film was 250,000 $! IT was so absurd it was funny. It was Monty Python's greatest movie. An Ingenious creation and the best ever in my opinion.
B00003CXFV|4.0|This movie may have changed my opinion of Julia Roberts.  I have never like her acting, and the media's portrayal of her as some sort of beauty queen in the 80's (and she has never been a very attractive woman) only made it worse.  But she did an excellent job in this story, seemingly portraying the real Erin Brockovich with perfection.<br />Great story, maybe a little hard to believe though if you didn't know it was true.  But everything was very well done.  All the characters were good.  One bad thing is that they seem to have cut some scenes out to speed it up?  Some of the scene transitions were downright bizarre and there was no logic behind.  But other than that, no real complaints.<br />One thing I'd like to point out to people before they watch this is that Erin Brockovich is not a very likable person.  She's profane, crude, obnoxious, rude, and treats everyone around her, especially those who are better educated, like garbage.  She always had trouble finding and keeping a job and she always blamed it on her lack of education and experience.  That wasn't it.  It was her attitude.
B000051VWW|5.0|Heartbreak never sounded so good.  I'm a writer and this CD has inspired some of the best poetry I have ever written.  If you like music that relaxes you and takes you out of this world, then you'll like this CD.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|I watched VH1's Top 100 Rock Albums and was disappointed to see 'London Calling' placed only at number 25.  The Clash were one of the few British punk bands that didn't have to depend on controversy and outrageousness.  They possessed truly great musicianship and great eclectic tastes, and 'London Calling' is direct evidence of this.  The songs on here fall into all sorts of genres; punk (title track, &quot;Koka Kola&quot;), hard rock (&quot;Clampdown&quot;), reggae (&quot;Rudie Can't Fail&quot;, &quot;Revolution Rock&quot;), rockabilly (&quot;Brand New Cadillac&quot;), and the list goes on and on.  For a truly unique listening experience, I would recommend purchasing this album.  I would also highly recommend The Clash's other great albums 'Sandinista!' and their first self titled album.
0440219078|4.0|Before and as I read The Giver, I heard constant compliments and praise on how it is such a fantastic book.  I too agree with most peoples' opinion, for I found it a very well written book along with very interesting; however, I felt the ending to be unsatisfying.  Obviously, the conclusion is meant to be hanging, allowing the reader to use their imagination to predict what could have happened, but it didn't seem to fit the rest of the book.  As I read the book, I enjoyed the great details and could even picture everything as it happened, and to have an ending as it did, I was surprised.   The book shows a glimpse into a world with no memories.  Supposedly this is a `utopia.'  But again, I question this.  Jonas and everyone else live in a world of no memories, knowing nothing of the past, with the exception of Jonas and the giver.  With no memories of the past, the pain and the bad, along with all the good, what leaves them to learn from their mistakes.   Being in a world with no memories to learn from, the world would be chaotic, constantly making the same mistakes over and over again.
0688170528|5.0|Well, I work in a bookshop &amp; have been reading since I was a young little thing, but I must say that of all the books I have read in such a long time none have come close to touching me so deeply as this book. It deals with all the issues; young love, family pressures, friendships, and that all in the first few pages!! Jodi Picoult really knows how to write exactly the right thing at exactly the right time.  None of her books have been a disappointment, &amp; believe me, out of all the booksI recommend to friends, families &amp; customers, this would have to be one of the few which I always get great feedback about. So, If you're thinking about getting this great book, hesitate no longer, do yourself a favour.  Put your feet up, make free a whole afternoon, &amp; get immersed!!
B00003CXE7|3.0|Wish I'd seen it in the theater.  Was farily bored watching it, even in DD.  Cameron Crowe is good, but in the end it doesn't veer much from other Gladiator movies made long ago.  Save your money and wait for Cast Away to come to DVD.

Put on the studio album, turn out the lights, and CRANK IT. This is what true musical experimentation is all about. This album is more influential than you might think - anyone who listens to the current wave of ambient/noise/electronica will recognize it's value. Anything goes, boys and girls. Whoops!

B0000542DJ|4.0|This new DVD Special Edition of Oliver Stone's JFK adds several new features to the classic political thriller.<br />First is commentary by Stone himself, which runs the gamut from fascinating behind the scenes glimpses to self-serving and intentionally misleading propaganda. Stone, to his credit, does correct a few inaccuracies including the \\"three tramps\\" contention which he now admits is bogus. He is occasionally defensive and refers frequently to critics of the film sometimes in a derogatory fashion.<br />A second addition to the disc is the deleted and extended scenes. Three of these stand out-a meeting between Garrison and \\"Mr. Miller\\" (a personification of the military-industrial complex or secret government, which ever you prefer), a scene where the ghost of Oswald speaks, and an alternate ending again featuring \\"Mr. X\\". Most of the other scenes are mere extensions or scenes rightfully deleted.<br />Rounding out the special features are two \\"multimedia essays\\". The first is a segment on documents released by the ARRB presented by Jim DiEugenio. The other is an interview with Fletcher Prouty, the inspiration for the film's \\"Mr. X\\". The essays will probably not enlighten those familiar with either gentleman, but newcomers may find them useful.<br />If you have yet to purchase JFK on DVD now is the time to do so. This new version adds some welcome features that \\"junkies\\" of the subject will certainly enjoy.

6302968143|4.0|Hocus Pocus is one of those films that didn't have much of a life at the box office, but which has become a Halloween staple in video form.  Hocus Pocus' has a lot going for it - including a well developed plot, likable characters, the acting talents of Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy - not to mention Omri Katz and an early appearance by Thora Birch (of American Beauty fame).  It even includes a rather fitting musical rendition of &quot;I Put A Spell On You&quot; by Midler.  But Hocus Pocus' greatest strength is perhaps that it remains a great Halloween flick for younger audiences.  It isn't to terribly scary, and I don't think anyone over the age of 15 will be holding onto their seats too tightly, but it remains a little creepy for the elementary set, who, after all, might want a little scare on Halloween, but aren't ready for the likes of 'Rosemary's Baby'.  <br />The story revolves around Max Dennison(Omri Katz), who, having recently moved to Salem from Southern California, is feeling a little out of place and put off by all of the Halloween celebrations in America's first 'terror town'.  Having few friends, he is resigned to spending Halloween night taking his spunky and well spoken little sister, Dani (Thora Birch), trick-or-treating. They meet up with Max's new found crush, Allison, who tkaes them on a whirlwind tour of Salem's world famous witch museum - legened to be the former residence of the Sanderson Sisters.  To make a long story short, Max lights the black flame candle on All Hallows Eve, thereby bringing Winnie, Mary and Sarah Sanderson back from the dead, who must capture the lifeforces of the town's children before the sun rises or be turned to dust.  A scary, witty, and sometimes funny romp through nighttime Salem ensues.<br />While perhaps not the best film ever made, Hocus Pocus is an entertaining movie that stands as a great family Halloween staple.  For anyone with kids or a Disney video collection, Hocus Pocus is a must.
B00000IAU3|5.0|I previously reviewed this album in a not so complimentary manner, because of my reaction to the hype around it.  Then, I put the album away for a day or two.  I then put it back in the portable CD player and gave it another go around.  The next day I did it again, and again, ....    Since giving this album another chance, I have not been able to keep the CD out of the player for longer than 36 hours!  Ignore the hype when you listen to the album.  It has a very mellow and subtle mood that draws you in to listen to more.  Dido's voice is soothing in a mixture of a jazz and pop kind of way.  The instrumentation is not extravagant, but that just lets you hear her voice all the better.  The lyrics on some songs (Thank You) tell a little story.<br />To cut to the chase, I am not sorry that I bought this album.  And, I am looking forward to her next one (Is she working on a new one yet?).
B00004ZAV3|4.0|OK upon reading other reviews this CD may not be up to par as a selling point but as an album it does rate well. even if it doesn't have all the cuts from all the albums that would have made the top ten.as a former musician I know what sounds good  and what doesn't.This does and also takes us all back to when rock rock n roll was king before rap,newage,ect.every generation has music that represents it.this just happens to be from mine among many others.if you don't like rock then maybe theres another interest for you,maybe it doesn't still rock as well as the stones but I still think its good music like so many others from the era.to each their own.
0782008364|5.0|Well, you've read all reviews and know about the violence and lesbian love scene. Don't let this prompt for easy labeling or fast forwarding. Every moment in the movie is dedicated to something. Or rather some things at once. Character flip-flops and timeframe changes are gorgeous.

6305205639|5.0|i am such a huge metallica fan and they are the greatest band ever. i love all metallica new and old.this concert home vid is a good one. it isnt really the 80s thrashy metallica , it is 90s hard rock/metal. if you are a fan of true main stream arena rock , you'll love cunning stunts. the guitar work is awesome(i espeacialy like kirk's clear guitar with blue liquid inside,that was sharp lookin)..lars was very motivated in this show , you could tell he was just ready to go and same could be said about jason. james was fantastic both singin and guitar playin. he may have been a little vocaly lazy in some parts of the show but hey, he's james hetfield...leave him alone. the song selection is a good one and wait until you hear fuel. it is the origional,unfinnished version , sounds different from the fuel you know from reload but is really cool. wait until you see what happens during enter sandman.. if i were you i would not pass this one up.
B000002J03|1.0|I must say that I don't understand how you reviewers can describe this album as &quot;thunderous&quot;.When I first heard Whole Lotta Love I thought to myself &quot; it sounds like he's playing a toy guitar, a plastic guitar&quot;. I honestly thought it was a quiet intro before the real ,hard song began.The reviewer who said that no albums rocks quite as hard as this one must have a very small record collection. However before you Led Zeppelin fans damn my soul to the fiery pits of hell, I have to say that I do quite like this album because the toy guitar sound and cute songs like Thank you and What Is And what Should Never Be bring back some lovely childhood memories of being taken to Santa's Magic Grotto and seeing the elfs,the first time I saw Bambi in the theatre with my parents , and the nice birthday cake I got for my fourth birhday( it had a lovely little pink sugar mouse on it)
0140186395|4.0|I recently reread East of Eden.  The first time I read it, I thought it was powerful, the second specatcularly powerful.  The timeless issues in this book, Cain v. Abel, father and children, knowledge and its pursuit, and of course the concept of pursuing one's own destiny reverberate through each chapter.  Whether dealing with Charles and Adam, Lee, Kathy, Caleb and Aron or Samuel and the Hamiltons, the book raises so many questions worth pondering and discussing.  I would add this is one of the great book club books.  Anybody with a love of thought should read this.
B00000DRA9|5.0|The Neverending Story is one of those films that has sort of faded away into the depths of the forgotten by this point. This is unfortunatly because it really is quite a good movie, and as with many films, the soundtrack is part of the reason the film is so good.<br /> The soundtrack was cowritten by Klaus Doniger (best known for the score to &quot;Das Boot&quot;), and Giorgio Moroder. Luckily there is no quality loss between the two. The CD opens with the title song, 'The Never Ending Story', which is a wonderful way of getting you into the spirit of fantasy that the movie portrays. 'The Ivory Tower' is a wonderful upbeat track, while 'Ruined Landcape' and 'Theme of Sadness' are wonderful sentimental themes.<br /> The main showpieces of the soundtrack are 'Happy Flight' and 'Bastain's Happy Flight'. Basically the same, the music is the epitome of a flying theme -- a long sweeping melody that you never want to end on top of rolling backround. This melody is also used in the wonderful 'Atreju's Quest' and 'Atreju Meets Falkor'.  <br /> Overall, this soundtrack is a great score that is unfortunatly unknown but is indeed a worthy buy. Every track is good, which is quite rare for any CD.
0792844793|3.0|This movie was very interesting to watch and it had some really good scenes, but it did not flow the way I like a movie to flow. The movie just seemed to have a bunch of really different and unusual scenes put together and called a movie.  The performances the actors did were wonderful and Dennis Hopper did a fantastic job in his role.  David Lynch is a master when it comes to creating weid scenes and interesting charcters.  But when he put everything together the movie did not flow the way a movie should from scene to scene.  I would say you should see this movie just because of the acting.  If you like it buy, most people would not think this is a buy.<br />B
B00003CXAY|5.0|I just found out that this movie is not available for purchase and is hard to find for rent. I bought a copy on VHS over ten years ago and just realized how rare it is today.<br />If you are an environmentally and socially conscious person and feel that you are pro-earth and pro-people then this movie will connect with you. If you aren't, then don't bother.  The message will be lost on you and you'll just fall asleep watching it.<br />However, the images are something else.  I was on a 36 hour fast and put this video on again. I had not watched it in some time.  It was like I had never seen the movie before. <br />The only way that you can get this movie on DVD today is to make a 180 dollar contribution to the makers of this movie who have run short of money and are working on the third part of the trilogy of &quot;Qatsi&quot; movies. They have a website where they will tell you how to make the purchase.  Just enter the title of the movie plus .com<br />It would be well worth the money spent to get this on DVD because of the powerful imagery and the Glass soundtrack.
B0000399WI|5.0|Not many movies will capture your heart and soul like this one.  Wonderful performances, writing, editing and scenery come together to create one of the best dramas ever put on film.  If you see one prison movie in your life make it this one.  <br />For a great true prison story that has all the inspiration of Shawshank read &quot;Against All Hope&quot; by Armando Valladares.
B00004RFFS|3.0|First I'll review the DVD:<br /><br />I don't like that kind if package... it usually gets dirty and the picture fades with time.<BR> The DVD extras are ok, DTS version was a good idea, the menu is well done, the light effect when you navigate the menu is cool.<br /><br />About the movie.... I liked the first part... is really interesting, but I hated the part at the theatre.... I think they should've changed the whole scene for something more interesting.<br /><br />So, if you are not a big fan of this movie... I suggest you to look for something else...
B000050XEI|5.0|I must be Enya's best fan.  Since seeing her video on VH-1's &quot;History of Music Video from A-Z,&quot; I have followed her career.  I just don't understand why people have to complain about Enya's music.  With every piece, she puts all of her being.  Her music brings a sense of purity and creates worlds that have not existed in the minds of those who struggle day to day with the stresses of everyday life.  On this album, she follows the same format, which brings a sense of peace to the minds, hearts and souls of all of her true fans.  I would be very disappointed if I bought an Enya album, and rather chanting out her beautiful voices, she crossed-over into the pop/rock or any other disturbing genre.  I work for a music company, and when I play her album, the people buy it.  They tell me that they have never heard such an angelic voice. She is truly a savior of our souls.
0843176717|5.0|This is a short fabulous story in the powerfully beautiful Hargreaves Mr Men &amp; Little Miss series. What happens to Mr Clever when he passes beyond the boundary of his Cleverland? He finds for all his cleverness, he has little practical knowledge. A friend of mine said to me that this is similar to college graduates who, after leaving university, find little practical application for all their clever thoughts. This is very true and this small book would make a good joke gift for graduates for this reason. You will find many small but profound similarities between the characters in these little books. They are sharp and witty looks at single aspects of people's personalities. No doubt adults as well as children will draw much enjoyment from them.
6302753295|4.0|McLintock is a romantic comedy first, a western second. As a romantic comedy in an old west setting, it works quite well. This is John Wayne at his best, in my opinion. I haven't seen many of the &quot;serious&quot; westerns he made in his younger days, but I did see &quot;True Grit&quot; (the movie they gave him an oscar for). I thought it was awful. Of course, that wasn't necessarily Wayne's fault, but he looked as though it was all he could do to keep from bursting with laughter throughout most of it.  Like a number of other macho actors (Burt Reynolds, for example), Wayne has a certain dry wit that comes across well. Here he is paired with Maureen O'Hara, and they make a good team. There are also lots of other familiar faces in this (Chill Wills, Stephanie Powers, Yvonne deCarlo, Jerry VanDyke, and more) who contribute solid performances.<br />McLintock isn't a great movie. It will not go down in the annals of film classics. Most of the humor isn't terribly original, and the fights in the mud pit are pure slapstick. Then again, there's nothing wrong with that. They work. It is an entertaining, funny movie and most folks will have a good time watching it. Give it a try. I give it a strong 4+ stars. Be careful what edition you get, though. I have no problem with mine (the John Wayne Estate authorized edition), but apparently some editions are of poor quality.

B00004XQ83|5.0|I also grew up in the 60's on the Beatles and Stones. I'm still a classic rock enthusiast. I dislike &quot;country&quot; music. I love this CD. It's a great combination of bluegrass and folk and old southern songs and I can't stop playing it. Just brings a smile to my face as I think about all the parts of the movie. I bought the soundtrack the day after I saw the movie. I've played it so many times, that this weekend, I saw the movie again to see where all the music fit in. The movie was just as good the second time. Buy this CD, you won't be disappointed!
0452282152|4.0|This is a spare, taut novel told with unflinching honesty by the narrator, Griet, the maid and model for Vermeer's singular portrait from which this novel takes its title.  I enjoyed this novel far better than another piece of historical fiction that I recently read, The Dress Lodger.  While both author's do a good job of evoking a bygone time and place, the lack of  sentimentality distinguishes this book from the other. <br />There is a striking parallel between the storyteller's art and Vermeer's exquisitely serene paintings - uncluttered and disarmingly direct but with each object chosen with great care and bursting with iconographic meaning.  The highlight of the book for me was when, at the artist's behest, Griet pierces her second ear, the one that will not be visible in the painting, because in Vermeer's words \\"It is a farce to wear only one.\\"  All of Griet's repressed and smoldering attraction to the painter is expressed in this simple, stinging act of obedience. <br />There are other great moments and characters in the book: the slow unveiling and recognition of Vermeer's actual masterpieces as Griet carefully cleans and resets the props of works in progress  in her master's studio; the pathos of Griet shunning her sister, Agnes, in the marketplace; the darkly ludicrous scene of Vermeer's wealthy patron, van Ruijven, groping Griet as she hangs the wash; the furtiveness of Griet and Pieter, the butcher's son, in the alley after Griet accidentally unfurls her hair in front of Vermeer; the sense of excitement and anticipation as Vermeer and van Leywenhoek struggle up the narrow stairway with the camera obscura; the quiet desperation of Griet's parent's who see in the Pieter a son-in-law and an end to meatless stews; the happy industry of Griet and Vermeer grinding pigment in the attic; Cornelia, a marvelous rendering of 17th century Delft's answer to the \\"Bad Seed\\"; Maria Thins, Vermeer's sharp-eyed, wily mother-in-law, puffing on her pipe; and many, many more. <br />Like the historical Vermeer, this fictive Vermeer remains shadowy and elusive and in the end the author stays true to the essential mystery of Vermeer.  He is an artist first and foremost, with eyes \\"worth a room full of gold...who thinks only of himself and his work.\\"  Ms. Chevalier does a masterful job weaving together the few known facts and people associated with the artist's life and crafting a compelling novel that rings true.
0812589041|5.0|Ender's Game is a masterwork. Not only does it explore the human mind, it tells an exciting story of war and politics. Ender is tricked into killing the Buggers, who turn out to be ramen instead of varlese (see Demosthene's definitions), leaving Ender with an immense amount of guilt, introducing the other works in this series. Read it, you won't regret it.
0451169514|4.0|I liked the book &quot;IT&quot; a lot and their are many good parts. Still, this book is too long and it's not that I can't like long books because I loved &quot;The Stand&quot; complete and uncut. I stopped reading the book halfway through because of boredom. About a year later I picked it up and finished IT. Much of the middle section is boring and pointless. This book could have been much better if a hundred pages smaller. <br />Still, I did finish the book and it was worth it. The end is good and the events leading up to the end are great. Henry Bowers was a very interesting characters, as well as others. The rock fight is the best part of this book and is one of those scenes that keep you reading. All in all a good book, but it could have been great if some of the pointless dribble in parts was eliminated.

B0000029DD|5.0|My brother had music playing before his wedding as everyone sat down, and &quot;Hallelujah&quot; was on the tape he had playing.  I stopped in my tracks and closed my eyes.  It was the most intoxicating song I had ever heard...I felt like falling to my knees and crying.  A week later I ran to the store and bought &quot;Grace.&quot;  I listened to it that night on my head phones and I thought my heart was going to burst out of my chest.  I couldn't contain it.  Music had never, ever moved me so intensly.  Right there in my bed I cried and cried over nothing at all and everything that ever happened to me at the same time.  It was probably the strangest experiences I've ever had.  Buy this CD.  You will never regret it.
B000059XYL|5.0|WHen I first saw the Priviews for this movie I admit it I rolled my eyes a bit. It looked just like a bunch of women table dacing in a bar. And that didn't intrest me at all so I never saw it at the theaters. But when it came out on video all my friends where telling me what a great moive it was and I was shocked. It WAS good. It was a about a girl named Violet who traveled to the city to start a song writign carrer. But the problem is she was onyl getting snubbed. So in an attempt to make some quick cash she becomes a bar tender at a bar called cyote ugly. A place where women call all the shots and looking hot and being gwilling to do pretty much anything is a must. It takes her a while to get used to it but soon she learns that her voice is a powerful tool that could keep her this job, and maybe get her futher. If she could just get rid of her stage fright.<br />THis movie was a great drama and romatic comedy (even though I didn't mention a guy in my summary). I reccomend it to anyone. Don't be fooled by the previews. There is a plot to this movie. ANd it's a good one.
006016848X|5.0|This is a fantastic book which will give you a better understanding of what men and women need in their relationship, and why each responds to situations in a different manner. Why do men need to &quot;withdraw into their cave?&quot;  Bearing the fact men are not mind readers, how do you tell the man in your life what you really need? Encourage your spouse or partner to read this book or better still, share the experience of reading it together. <br />A man who recently separated from his wife, said to me, after reading this book, &quot;Gee, maybe now I know what I was doing wrong.  Why didn't she tell me?&quot;  Well, perhaps she tried but, being a &quot;Martian,&quot; perhaps he did not know how to interpret the message of one from &quot;Venus.&quot; This book provides a straight-forward approach to communication, which as a counsellor, I have found lacking in many relationships.  The book will explain how men and women express themselves in a different manner, how each can interpret the meaning in a different way, and how we can effectively respond.  <br />I highly recommend this plain and simple book. After reading it, you will truly be able to see that while both genders have a different way of expressing themselves, and different quirks that make them tick, we really do not come from different planets;  sometimes it just seems that way. It makes an excellent conversation piece on the bedside table for those late night, intimate little talks.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I received this CD as a Christmas present, and, before I had even listened to the entire CD once, I knew I had become a Beatles fan. Sure, I'd heard the Beatles before, I'm not that removed from society, but this album is what hooked me. Some of the other reviewers don't think that is album has the Beatles best songs, but what their best songs are is really your own opinion. This album shows only a small portion of what the Beatles did to influence music. The lyrics, the music, everything is ingenious and perfect. I will admit, it isn't the style of music I usually listen to, but it is still awesome. My personal favorite on this album is &quot;Come Together,&quot; but every song is great. And although some of the songs are not from the original tapes (some have been remastered), it still manages to show the Beatles genius songwriting. No, it may not have the Beatles &quot;greatest&quot; work, but it is a great sampling of their songs to get new fans interested. It definitely got me interested.
B00004UEDR|3.0|The movie starts out with an interesting setup. Gwen Cummings (Sandra Bullock) is a young woman with an obvious alcohol problem. After a night of drinking, she wakes up late to her sister's wedding. She spends the entire time going to the wedding drinking and ultimate ruins her sisters wedding by falling in the cake and then wrecking the limo going to get another one. For her actions, she is given a choice of rehab or jail. She chooses rehab. <br />Interesting film with some great acting. However, the plot twists are a bit contrived. At first, she is just doing time, but, in a moment of insanity realizes that she needs help and begs to stay.<br />From then on, her turnaround, from doing time to cooperative inmate, is almost on the verge of miraculous. And, this is where certain parts of the plot stop working and break the illusion created by an otherwise excellent film. This is not all that bad, but a bit more work on the script, and this could have been an award winner.<br />If you have ever read Syd Field's book Screenplay, you can see the plot devices coming out. From lifting a horse's hoof to possible rehab romance, this movie is formula all the way.<br />But, it works. Somehow, through all of the veneer created, a touching story shines through. If you decide to see this one, don't expect another Sandra Bullock comedy. While there are some funny moments, the tragedy of the characters' problems overshadows most of the humor.
B000050IMG|1.0|Was A Scary Movie funny? Yes. What was funny was how this noncreative, unimaginative, piece of trash even made it to the screen. You would have had to smoke as much dope as they did in this movie to even find it worth snickering at. They took every nasty, foul, perverted subject, mixed it with the plots of movies that were worth watching, and spewed forth this disgusting concoction. It is no wonder that the Wayans Brother's show was cancelled. And I must shame the people in charge of giving this movie an R rating when it easily could have and should have gotten an X, but I guess money speaks louder than basic rating guidelines. If this movies speaks for what future generations will call funny, then God help us all.
B000002H5I|5.0|Tracy Chapman's first release is one to treasure. There are some really strong lyrics about living in the ghetto, dreaming about a better life, and declarations to her lover and family. Some songs are a little bit short, but they bring a great message. Tracy's voice is a very distinct one, like she is in the middle of the songs she sings about. There are no weak songs on this album but the strongest songs are in my opinion: Talkin'Bout A Revolution, Fast Car (best!), Behind The Wall, and For You!
1563896656|4.0|Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill combine for an exciting ride with Allan Quartermain, Jekyll and Hyde, Mina Murray(Harker), the Invisible man, and Captain Nemo. With guest appearances by Sherlock Holmes, Auguste Dupin, the Artful Dodger and a few of literatures great villains this book is fun journey through &quot;what if?&quot; territory with incredible visuals by O'Neill of an England that never was but might have been. The storyline is a bit predictable but overall Moore makes these characters come alive again in a format that appeals to today's readers. I look forward to a return of this group and maybe a visit with the earlier team that seems to have contained such members as Natty Bumpo and Dr. Syn. The only thing missing as mentioned in another review is the Victorian ads that were in the original comics, some were priceless!
B00003CXDG|1.0|Let me get to the point, this movie is a waste of 2 hours.<BR> Period.<BR> I watched it on DVD along witgh a friend of mine and all we were both yawning about 20 minutes into the movie; this continued until the end.<BR> My biggest compaints:<BR> - John Woo's obsession with slow-motion shots.  I hate them.  And in this movie, they are a dime a dozen.<BR> - The excessive use of the flesh-mask...  Three or four times the darn thing got used; and by the second time you can already tell that they guy is wearing it.<BR> - Story is bland at best.<BR> - Action is so-so at best, only high point was motorcycle chase at the end.<BR> - The end sucks.<BR> Notice how I am not complaining about how &quot;fantastic&quot; or &quot;unbelievable&quot; this movie is...  When I watch something called MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, I expect it to be unbelievable, so that was not a problem for me.<BR> I would also like to state that I liked the first one quite a bit.<BR> Skip this movie if you can.  You have been warned.
0307165485|5.0|Researchers constantly find that reading to children is valuable in a variety of ways, not least of which are instilling a love of reading and improved reading skills. With better parent-child bonding from reading, your child will also be more emotionally secure and able to relate better to others. Intellectual performance will expand as well. Spending time together watching television fails as a substitute.<br />To help other parents apply this advice, as a parent of four I consulted an expert, our youngest child, and asked her to share with me her favorite books that were read to her as a young child. Richard Scarry's Best Story Book Ever was one of her picks.<br />This book was my daughter's choice night after night during the years from ages 3-6.  The stories are all vividly colored, humorous, and reasonably short.  They just suited her perfectly.<br />She would plead after each one, &quot;Just one more story, Dad.&quot;  (This was after her mother had read to her, as well.)  I would read until I had almost no voice left.  Eventually, we negotiated that she could pick two stories from this book, and if I was in the mood (and in good voice) we could go up from there.  Otherwise, bedtime would have been delayed for hours!<br />If you don't know Richard Scarry, he has a wonderful, light sense of humor.  He usually features intelligent animals, but in human-like contexts.  This makes the moral of the story easier for the youngster to swallow, while making the story more interesting.  For example, A Castle in Denmark is about the rules that you should follow in a castle (or a house) such as not leaving things on the floor where people can trip on them.  Who else would have come up with such a wonderful way to help establish household rules?<br />The stories in the book contain all the elements needed in a preschool book, with lots of alphabet, numbers, socialization, and charming stories with important lessons attached.  The book includes one of my daughter's all time favorite stories, I Am a Bunny by Ole Rison.  This story was repeated like a mantra around our house by all four children.  It is a great beginning reader story.<br />The stories vary in sophistication from simple ones to mini-mysteries involving detectives.  My daughter especially loved the mini-mysteries.<br />Here are her favorite stories in the book (in the order they appear):<br />The Rabbit Family's Home<br />I Am a Bunny<br />Work Machines<br />Pip Pip Goes to London<br />A Castle in Denmark<br />Couscous, the Algerian Detective<br />Officer Montey of Monaco<br />Pierre, the Paris Policeman<br />The Country Mouse and the City Mouse by Patricia Scarry<br />Schtoompah, the Funny Austrian<br />From a value perspective, it is much less expensive to buy these stories in this form than to get them in the various Richard Scarry books.  Of all the story books we bought for our children, this one was definitely the best value.  I suspect it only cost about a penny per hour used.  Running the television costs more than that!<br />Some readers have complained about the binding.  Ours is a little loose in back after four years of hard use.  For such a thick book, that's about par for the course.  If your child is a hard user of books, you may want to get a new copy at some point.<br />After you have finished enjoying this book for the 4,317th evening in a row (if you have a large family), I suggest that you think about how these stories could be made even funnier by changing the context.  For example, a castle in Denmark could become Cinderella's castle after she married the prince.  What rules do you suppose Cinderella would have wanted to have?  In this way, you and your child can exercise your imagination to have even more fun.<br />Take great stories and build on them . . . together with your child!time favorite stories, I Am a Bunny by Ole Rison.

B00004TH83|5.0|For those of us who enjoy music with substance, meaning and feeling, Lara Fabian's debut album has all of that and then some.  The range and power of her voice makes you want to cry one minute and shout out for joy in the next.  I hate to do comparisons, but this singer is Celine Dion, and Barbara Streisand all rolled into one marvelous vocalist.  If you don't add Lara Fabian to your collection, you're just missing out!
B000056VIY|5.0|Jennifer Lopez has done a wonderful job at delivering her music to a broad audience. Her album is a mixture of a strong R&amp;B flavor with a Latin brew and some pop. It is not like any albums that are released right now that we all here over and over again. This CD may have some beats that are almost familiar but the songs all have their creative twist. One of my favorite tracks is &quot;It's Not Me.&quot; The hook section of this song has an unique beat. I was surprised to have read that Sean &quot;Puffy&quot; Combs  helped produced this track along with two other tracks. The tracks he helped produce is not like any songs you have ever heard from him. The slow track &quot;Come Over&quot; it is not bad for what Jennifer can do with her vocals. She did not go over her vocal range which makes this track pleasant to listen to. The tracks &quot;I'm Real,&quot; &quot;Walking On Sunshine,&quot; and &quot;Love Don't Cost A Thing&quot; are a few of my favorite tracks that really stand out on this album. There is really no comparison to Ms. Lopez to any other singers that are out because she does not try to sound like them. She has her own sound. Jennifer Lopez has done a wonderful job of blending different types of music to her album.
0060930187|4.0|I'm not one to read poems, and so, I guess because of that reason I stayed away from anything to do with Sylvia Plath.  Until finally I grew tired of colleagues of mine talking about this book, and decided to experience it for myself.<br />I'm still not sure to describe how I feel about the book.  It was easy reading, but at times I did grow bored, particularly the pages that are dedicated to how Esther tries to commit suicide.  And yet it would have been too important to leave out.<br />Overall, the story of Esther saddened me, knowing that Ms. Plath was basically writing about her own life.  I wonder if she had been born much later (when depression wasn't considered taboo), and she would have gotten the proper treatment for her depression, what could have been.  Sadly, we'll never know.  I didn't realize how much of a stigma was attached to depression or &quot;crazy people&quot; back then.  In that way, the book touched me.<br />In a way, the ending wasn't very satisfying, but maybe that's the point.  Nothing everything is as clear-cut as we expect it to be.
B000021Y77|2.0|Wake me up when it's over!  The only reason this movie gets two stars is for it's look and the excellent way the movie was shot.  After that, it's just boring, repetitive dribble.  I like the Hollywood movies better.  &quot;Groundhog's Day&quot; is 15 times better than this unimaginative lump of crap.
B000002GYR|5.0|This is oneof the most fabulous cd's in my collection.  You can almost smell the cigarette smoke... hear the muffled conversation of the lonely people gathering their memories as they begin to leave the bar.  The taste of cheap bourbon and the reality of 4am permeates this record.  Both profoundly sad... and wonderfully celebratory of the denizens of Tom Waits world!!
B000051VWW|4.0|Great CD. I have followed Sade since I first heard Smooth Operator from the Diamond Life CD. Sades smooth style and her very romantic references have always captured my heart. 8 years is way too long for this fan to wait for a new relaese. Lovers rock is definetly not as good as her last one (Love Deluxe), but it is a fresh change and it shows that the lady can do something different without sacrificing the soul we all know and love.

B000056VIY|1.0|Jennifer, honey, I understand you've been trying to establish your role in our society, but you STILL don't have enough vocal talent. And you're STILL showing off your body! I agree with many people who say that she should just stick to acting. She's not good at singing, but you have to appreciate the fact that  she's enjoying success with this album as she did with her &quot;6&quot; album from 1999. After seeing a piece of the new &quot;Love Don't Cost A Thing&quot; music video, however, I was shocked: she took off her shirt and flung it at the screen. LDCAT is one of the selections on the soundtrack to Lopez's new &quot;Wedding Planner&quot; film. But I liked &quot;If You Had My Love&quot; SO MUCH BETTER. Sorry, Jennifer, you still don't work for me. I'm sticking to my usual interests.
B00004XOWN|5.0|This is a must buy cd. It includes Redman, Method Man, Xibit, and DMX. The rap and rock in this cd is awsome. The intro and outro are both cool too. So if you're a Limp Bizkit fan and don't have this cd, then I suggest you go out to Wal-Mart or K-Mart and buy this awsome cd. The unedited version cd is even cooler but I had to get the edited one. My five best rated songs are My Generation, Rollin'(Air Raid Vehicle), Hot Dog, Rollin'(Urban Assault Vehicle), and Take A Look Around.
B00003CX9S|5.0|This film is a classic! It tells the life story of a man who was beautiful on the inside, but ridiculed by society because of what he looked like on the outside. In many ways, the world is still that way today, and that is why this film should be preserved and shown to each new generation so that they can learn compassion and realize that it is what is on the inside of an individual human being that counts, and not just how beautiful they are on the outside. Beauty is indeed only skin deep, and often just a mask. Joseph Merrick was a real person, he really had to live like that, and during a most difficult and judgemental time in history (the Victorian age) when people who thought themselves learned and above that which they did not understand were really just ignorant without cause. John Merrick was a beautiful angel, and this film will leave you feeling as if you knew him. John Hurt's performance as Mr. Merrick is truly remarkable, a masterpiece. Yes, the ending is sad, as was Joseph's life, but if you look at it with open eyes you will learn something from the film; it will teach you something very important about love and compassion, and empathy.
B000003TAR|4.0|From the outset this is a distinctly anti-mainstream about album.  Nirvana recognised their commercialisation, and nobly attacked the values that this had associated them with.  Hence, we get tracks such as cynically titled as 'Radio Friendly Unit Shifter'.  Generally, the album's lyrics harbour something closest to an organic 'perversity': 'throw down your umbilical chord so I can climb right back'.  In short, Nirvana developed more than they were given credit for, and with the devastatingly simple 'All Apologies' matched the very best of their output.  Disturbing and subtly tuneful, 'In Utero' is 'Nevermind's more knowing cousin
6305297525|3.0|I wasn't really looking forward to seeing it, and I'm not sure why.  I suppose the trailers just didn't really appeal to me.  I got that sick sort of feeling one gets after eating too much candy.  I guess I was afraid that I might gag if the sentimentality was overdone, like having to watch a sappy Hallmark commercial on a loop for two hours.  Hork.  I would've skipped it altogether if my movie buddy, Dan, hadn't twisted my arm.<br /><br />Robin Williams was wonderful, as usual, and I've always loved Annabella Sciorra since I saw her in \\"True Love\\".  But parts of the movie seemed to drag on and on and on till I was ready to pluck out my own eyeballs and run screaming up the aisle.<br /><br />I suppose I would recommend it for two things: the special effects, which are unique and extraordinarily well-done for the time, and the interpretation of hell (wasn't that impressed with the interpretation of heaven -- could've been less boring, i.e., is that all there is?)  Hell was vastly interesting -- if people are destined to go to hell, they find not a burning lake of fire, but rather the hell they created for themselves while on earth when they had free choice to make of life whatever they could or would.  Interesting concept based loosely on Dante's \\"Inferno\\" (as opposed the \\"Disco Inferno\\" which was the hell I lived through in college - Ha!).
B000002N3N|5.0|Now I truly know what Angels sound like!  Enya, as always, is beautiful and soul soothing with her melodious poetry. &quot;Hope Has A Place&quot; is the best musical love sonnet I have ever had the pleasure to hear.
0783217048|4.0|It's no &quot;Priscilla, Queen of the Desert,&quot; but this movie is Entertaining and has a bigger budget. It is very, very difficult to buy-into Swayze or Snipes as Transvestites, but Leguziamo comes-across as a fiesty little woman. &quot;To Wong Foo&quot; would-have been more acceptable, if the characters were chosen realistically, instead-of for their Recognition factor.... If real performers in the art would-have been chosen, instead-of Stars-Names, the film would be a classic. However, it flops in comparison with &quot;The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.&quot;
B00005214X|5.0|When the original triple album boxed set first came out, I remember how it shocked so many people.  Lennon &amp; McCartney were supposed to be the Beatles who had all the song writing and singing talent.  We had had clues of Harrison's talent with songs like &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; and &quot;Something&quot;, but this release showed his greatness.  For me, a lifelong Beatles fan, this re-issue was worth the purchase if only for the new verison of &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;.  Of course, like so many re-issues done on CD, the quality is so much greater, I heard instruments and sounds I'd never noticed on the albums or cassettes.  The packaging is great and the photos contained in the booklet are  fabulous.  For Beatles fans, this is a must!
071198042X|2.0|Is this the real life?I think Pheobes writting in fantasy,is my best accolade for this undesireable memoir.Taken as a costume designer by Freddie ,Mr Freestone accounts for very little in this memoir----apart from his memory may not serve him well these days.As to account as a memoir ,I think Pheobe should recite some more opera to fullfill the meaning of memoir. With little regard to scandal or the need of more fact in the late Mercury,I regard this title .....CASHING IN ON A DUE,THAT OBVIOUSLY Mr Freestone thiks he deserves??????.Strange but true what the millions of fans world wide need is?????not this title but an accurate account of Mercurys days as deplicted by his lover Jim Hutton(MERCURY&amp;ME).Surely Mr Freestone could have accounted for missed years ?instead of grinding on what has been. Tomorrows fish &amp; chips is what i accept will end as this title.
B0000214G6|5.0|I have loved this film, since the first time I got my hands on a copy, ten years-ago! Unfortunately, it seems most of the great aspects of this movie have already been covered--&quot;Tony from Down Under&quot; did a fine job of reviewing &amp; commenting about this film--however.... I would like to add that this film is not-only a very well-made, well-casted and classic treasure, but is also a Wonderfully Stimulating movie for Couples! You've probably seen the parody scenes inspired by this film and you may even know they are somehow connected with this movie, yet you may not realize how ...  sensual this movie can be for a relationship.  &quot;9 1/2 Weeks&quot; is a must-see for Couples, married or not, because of the many &quot;Role-Playing&quot; concepts explored and the many sensual explorations of normal, everyday surroundings. A scarf can become a blindfold, food becomes....experimental, Dining becomes Adventure, Life becomes a Game....and you play to live Life to the Fullest.  If the basic concepts of the movie are adapted to a relationship (sans the Ego-Tripping), the relationship becomes stimulating, refreshing and always-evolving, instead-of stagnating or boring. Lovers who explore these techniques will be inspired to recreate their own romantic scenarios....  This is an inexpensive way to add decades of Adventure to your private relationships. Have a blindfold, candlelight and massage oil ready, guys--because, she'll want you to spoil her, after you watch this one together!
B000056H7W|5.0|This album just knocks me off my feet every time I listen to it. I'm not going to compare it to their other albums in quality, you just can't do that, they're all perfection. But musically it's mostly like Still Life. More riff-oriented composition, less clean parts, and separate songs. It still carries a unique feel and has some new styles throughout (such as the overlapping and dual vocals and high steady guitars). <br />It starts off with Leper Affinity, a very heavy and varied track. Bleak has a bit of an Eastern sound and contains some great guest vocals, very pleasing. Harvest is the first acoustic track, mostly strummed guitars with beautiful vocal harmonies. The Drapery Falls starts out with a wonderful 5 minute clean section, then has a powerful section in the middle and comes out like the beginning again for the last minute or so. Dirge of November starts with a beautiful acoustic piece, goes into a steady part with really nice dual vocals, then ends with an another beautiful piece. Funeral Portrait is one of their best heavy songs so far, it just has to be heard. Patterns in the Ivy is the second acoustic, very nice piano, relaxing song. Finally, the title track is just amazing. I just love the feelings that different parts give. I also have to mention the great bass playing on this one.<br />Basically, just buy it. Really. I see no alternative.
6300163431|5.0|This Haunting flick is a Bluesy Classic that never leaves your mind. Scenes remain permanently lodged in your data banks and influence your opinion of other noir films. How could anyone compare to DeNiro, in this role ? Rouke is very convincing as an archetypal &quot;down and out detective&quot; and brings a special feel to the character that only he could deliver. There are many cliche' scenarios in this film, but I can't recall anything that surpasses &quot;Angel Heart's&quot; version of &quot;detective thriller, with a twist.&quot;  I hate when people spoil a movie, so I'll refrain from revealing the plot, yet I encourage everyone to explore this Psychological Detective story for themselves. The characters are superb and Lisa Bonet got in a lot of hot water over the sexual scenes.... Confront your inner demons and explore the human capacity for evil.
B000002I2M|5.0|When I first heard this album, I was absolutely blown away. My previous exposure to The Doors had been limited to a double-CD set with all the hits. I'd heard \\"LA Woman\\", but not \\"The Changeling\\"! What a revelation! This album is especially poignant to me, because it is the final Doors album and the last piece of work produced by that madman Jim Morrison. Listen to him on \\"Hyacinth House\\" singing \\"I need a brand new friend who doesn't bother me, I need a brand new friend who doesn't trouble me, I need someone, yeah, who doesn't need me\\".    What was he talking about? A new girl to replace Pamela? A new drug to replace alcohol? A new muse to replace those he had lost on his haphazard journey through rock stardom? It seems to me that Morrison was tired of the whole \\"rock star\\" schtick and wanted to finally be the artist he had always dreamed he would be : an old bluesman that we could all understand. He, along with the other band members, found that bluesman for this album and forced him to write some great songs.     The album opens with \\"The Changeling\\", and it grabs you by the throat as Jim's howls compete with Ray's dominant keyboards. Robbie's \\"Don't You Love Her Madly\\" pulls us back from the brink with a nice little ditty which Morrison makes his own with his deep, bottom-of-the-well bellows.     Next up is a song that's blues on steroids, \\"Been Down So Long\\". The addition of an in-studio bass player really gives some balls to this song. \\"Cars Hiss By My Window\\" is so mellow it almost puts you to sleep, but it's so spooky, almost as if Morrison's in the room with you, at a cheap motel on a beach, in the early morning darkness. \\"Side One\\", as we used to call it, ends with \\"LA Woman\\" and it's everything the supposed opuses on previous albums, \\"The End\\" and \\"When The Music's Over\\", were supposed to be. \\"LA Woman\\" succeeds because it's a better song straight up than the other two, but also because the lyrics tell a coherent and believable story. We get to ride withMorrison for a night and what a wild ride it is!     Side two opens with an entirely different feel, \\"L'America's\\" military drumbeats marching us along to Jim's vocal cadence. Is he the rainmaker, the widowmaker, or just someone who wants to steal your wife? Who knows?!    \\"Hyacinth House\\" is, in my view, the saddest song Morrison ever wrote (just ahead of \\"Crystal Ship\\"), with Jim's mournful tone and Robbie's tasteful guitar fills dancing together. \\"Crawling King Snake\\" is probably what had been in Jim's head since he was a kid listen' to black radio. It's nice to see him take another legend's material (John Lee Hooker) and make it his own.     \\"The Wasp\\" continues the hard-driving blues train and is Jim's own contribution to the genre. His poetic lyrics drive this one straight into your mind's eye. He could be a good poet, when he took the time to polish his raw product, which he seems to have done with the lyrics for this song. The album ends softly with \\"Riders On The Storm\\", a eulogy for Morrison if there ever was one. Last words, last words... out!    Nobody knows what Morrison and the Doors would have done if he had not died in Paris in '71. We can only speculate. I am just thankful that he lived as long as he did and contributed so much to my life and the lives of countless others through his musical talents. This album is a big part of that gift, so if you do not have it, buy it today. You will not regret it.
B00001NFCY|5.0|I loved this CD!  All of the songs were wonderful..but &quot;Arms wide open&quot; and &quot;Higher&quot; were my favorites.  I play this so frequently in my car that my 4 year old daughter know what song is playing within 5 notes!  She then sings them along w/ me!

0671034065|5.0|I hate romances, and the concept of Romantic Mystery / Thriller is a yuck one. However, I read this one (mistakenly thinking it was just a plain ole Mystery/Thriller) and LOVED IT.<br />If this is ever made into a movie, I bet it gets an 18 certificate.<br />Great, witty dialogue (steamy scenes), coupla murders and a guy to die for... What else can a gal ask for?

B00000IQBM|5.0|This movie is definitely a must-see! Horrific suspense without gratuitous bloodshed. Don't watch this one alone.<br />A young family arrives at the historic Overlook Hotel where they will weather the harsh Colorado winter in isolation as the hotel's caretakers. The hotel has some unsavory history and seems alive with the past. The family begins to succumb to the malevolent forces within but young Danny appears to be the focus of the activity. Was it chance, destiny, or Danny's psychic abilities which brought them to the hotel in the first place? A contest between psychic forces ensues where evil grapples with innocence.<br />Sterling performances by all actors, including Ms. Duvall. <br />One must understand Ms. Duvall's character, Wendy, in order to understand the performance. He, Nicholson, a violent former alcoholic with an explosive temperament; she, a timid housewife who tries to softpedal the relationship to avoid acrimony and temperamental outbursts, has learned that &quot;a soft answer turneth away wrath . . . .&quot; It is, in fact, that very whining timidity which often goads Nicholson's bullying character into taunting her.<br />Yet, while up against the tremendous energy of Nicholson's fine performance, Duvall does not fade into the woodwork. To the contrary, some of the most frightening scenes are those where Wendy's timid, frightened nature are juxtaposed against the violent, menacing actions of her partner; she all but slobbers out of fear! It is that unrelenting fear that heightens audience response. <br />I've seen this film no fewer than 40 times and still hyperventilate along with Wendy in the final bathroom scene--the woman is so terrified she cannot gather sufficient composure to tackle a single door lock or even to coordinate whole limbs, each of which appears to have a life of its own!<br />The bunny/bear-suit scene also heightens the bizarre and surreal context. Here, Duvall, who has just escaped being hacked to death by a husband who has clearly lost his mind, now discovers not only that there are other entities in this huge, isolated, creepy hotel, but some of them are performing what appear to be Soddom-and-Gommorah-like rituals in fuzzy little suits. Something warm and fuzzy which normally endears us now becomes something foul; again, evil juxtaposed against innocence.<br />No matter how many times I've seen it, whenever I feel the need to frighten myself I put this one on and it never fails to produce a rush of adrenaline. I wouldn't change one single thing about this flick.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|If you're tired of all of the confections on the radio that claim to be Rock n' Roll then, this album is for you. It was difficult to find in my area since the local purveyors of musicstuffs needed more room on the racks for commercialized, cookie-cutter products that some people have the audacity to call music. At The Drive In is not a group that is afraid to bring passion back to Rock. Their lyrics seem to be in the vein of William Burrough's &quot;cut-up&quot; style that makes sense in their nonsence. Every note is played with the raw power that has been missing in rock music since 1994. It is great to hear a new group be heavy without resorting to the rap-rock hybrid that has been retread and sold in recent years. If you want music that evokes the spirts of the Pixies and Nirvana then, I suggest you buy this album.
B00003CXBK|5.0|A lot has been written about Princess Mononoke, here, in the press and in other sources all over the world. Pretty much all of it (after the DVD release) has been positive, so I won't waste much time on that aspect in this review. All I can say is that it's an amazing movie, and from such a simple, yet intriguing concept. This, as said in other reviews is not Ghost or Akira, but then it's not trying to be, and doesn't need to be in that genre to succeed. This is a film which at first seems to follow a standard format, good versus bad, but on closer inspection, and through repeated viewing, the characters seem neither good nor bad, but all viewing the world through their own eyes and so justifying their actions according to their own situations and understandings. All trying to prosper and make the best for themselves with their limited view of the world. Truly it is only Ashitaka who can see the whole picture and attempts to unite the factions under this, to truly bring together the civilised world and the forest like in the past. This is the work of Hayao Miyazaki the same artist who gave us Nausicaa, and the quality and depth of the story shows. In fact anyone who is familiar with Nausicaa Of The Valley Of The Wind, will be familiar with this quality of work, and the flow and depth of the story is similar, both in ideas and content. In both stories a lone warrior struggles to better the world for all people. This is not a post-apocalyptic tale, or the story of a civilisation nearing collapse, it's the story of two worlds trying to be reunited through the efforts of the few. This is both an excellent movie and a very good DVD with some worthwhile extras. If you're new to Anime, or if you don't buy another animated titles this year, then please make sure you buy this one. If you think that maybe this is not your thing as it is animated, try to move past that and appreciate the film for what it is. It is not a childs cartoon, it is simply that the Japanese choose toanimate most of their features, as in this format the film can become more expressive than in live action pictures. This is truly a standout Movie and may yet become a modern masterpiece, experience it for yourself.

B00002MZ4W|5.0|Fiona Apple is up for Best Alternative Album and she certainly deserves it. I first stumbled across her music when a friend of mine sang &quot;Paper Bag&quot; in a talent show. I downloaded song after song from napster following, and was humming along to them all day. I got the C.D. for my birthday and it hasn't left my player since. Most albums have those one or two tracks that you skip over, or are impartial to. Not this one. I love every single song. A great investment for anyone. --Rachel
0380730367|4.0|Dennis Lehane has created one of the very best hard boiled-and-hip private investigator series in contemporary literature, the Boston-set adventures of Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro, plus their brutal-but-lovable sidekick, Bubba.  All of the books in the series have been exemplary, and in most ways, *Prayers for Rain* is no exception.  The plot is gripping, the villain is reprehensible, and there are enough twists in the story to keep readers fascinated right up until the slightly ambiguous and discordant ending.  <br />So for those who have followed the series from its beginnings with *A Drink Before the War* (and reading the books in order is definitely the way to go here), I would certainly recommend that they read this book, as surely they will enjoy it.<br />HOWEVER--I did develop some reservations this time around.  There were three aspects of *A Prayer for Rain* that I found annoying.  First, Lehane gives every impression here of having visions that, like Robert Parker's Spenser, Kenzie and Gennaro might someday grace their very own television series.  There is certainly nothing wrong with this, but the increasingly macho behavior of Kenzie, including in-you-face posturing in face-to-face encounters with his villains seems just a tad too similar to scenes from &quot;Nash Bridges.&quot;  I suspect that he would have gone ahead and called his adversary &quot;Bubba,&quot; were it not for the fact that one of the main characters in the novels already has claimed this name.  <br />And Bubba--ah, yes.  He's an interesting and in some ways lovable kind of sidekick character, but when he is brought front and center in the story, as he has this time around, the ridiculous nature of his *persona* becomes uncomfortably clear.  As another reviewer commented, he is a veritable cartoon character, a person who is real life would really be a kind of psychopathic monster.  Yet here he is portrayed not only as a kind of super-male &quot;warrior&quot;-hero, but a kind of warm-and-fuzzy one who engages in completely unlikely romantic conquests (I won't give away the details here), a feature which I would think many women readers would find kind of offensive. <br />The third flaw is a kind of minor thing, but it annoyed me just the same.  Lehane clearly has a strongly male persective in his approach to relationships and to women in general, and this becomes a limitation on the effectiveness of his writing sometimes.  For example, his idealized female protagonist, Angela, comes across as a fairly shallow character much of the time, and on occasion Lehane puts words and sentiments in her mouth which are pretty ridiculous.  For example, Angie postulates that Bubba's magnetism with regard to even the most cool and intellectual of women is attributed in part to the fact that he is &quot;hung,&quot; a fact that women allegedly can always tell, no matter what a man is wearing.  Give me a break, folks.<br />I know, picky, picky.  Overall, this novel stands head and shoulders above most others in this genre, and fans of the previous books certainly should go ahead and read it.  But I think that there is a tiredness to the Kenzie-Gennaro series by this point, and I suspect that Lehane himself agreed, since his newest book, *Mystic River*, has a different set of characters.
B00004XONN|5.0|To echo what Phil Selway, the brilliant drummer from this brilliant band, has said, &quot;don't listen to critics or listen to this album once&quot;, for unlike... that we have processed over the last three years (Backstreet Boys, N Sync, Korn, Limp Biskit) this album demands attention and, for lack of a better word, comprehension.  There is more here than just neat tricks that are made with instruments and Thom's unrecognizable voice, it is simply gorgeous.  If you are a true Radiohead fan and have written this album off as a disappointment, give it another listen, and I'm sure you'll discover something that you hadn't discovered before.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|The Beatles weren't perfect, but they're as close as we've come so far. These songs are utterly timeless. 100 years from now, the vernacular of this music will still be familiar to millions. The same people who find flaws in this collection or in its repackaging are those who look for flaws in everything so that they may feel better about their own shortcomings. Don't be fooled. Buy this CD for a child who has yet to discover the band and see how &quot;tired&quot; the music sounds to them.
B00004WGC4|5.0|Fawlty Towers is certainly one of, if not the best, British comedies ever made.  Written by John Cleese of Monty Python fame, and his wife at the time, Connie Booth, they tell the story of a hapless innkeeper in Torquay &quot;in the English Riviera.&quot;  Every denison of Fawlty Towers is a caricature on a British stereotype, and the guests introduce some Americans, Australians, Greeks, etc., which are also suitable caricatures of their respective countries.  This series was obviously made before the era of political correctness, and is all the better for it.<br />This series is not a repackaged version of Monty Python.  While maintaining the same high energy, it is much more a traditional sitcom.  It's been my experience that Monty Python fans think the series is excellent, and that many people who hate Monty Python also like it - it's much more universal.<br />There are notable quotables too numerous to mention, as well as some very funny physical humour.  The replay value of the episodes is very high - I've had this set a couple of years and have seen every episode numerous times, but I still can pop in a tape and laugh out loud at the antics.  On this version, there are also interviews with John Cleese talking about the origins of the series as well as the inspiration for the specific events and plots of each episode.  While informative once, I always skip over them now.  It would have been nice to have seen some of the other cast members (especially Booth) in these interviews, but it's not to be.<br />Thus, this set is highly recommended for any fan of the show.  If you have never seen it, I recommend waiting for a Fawlty Tower weekend on PBS before purchasing this set - while I think it's hilarious, the humour is probably not for everyone.

B00003CWTI|3.0|Paul Thomas Anderson's sweeping, biblical film is too epic for its own good. Everything is overdone in Magnolia. Too many characters, too many stories, too much emotion. Every scene is overflowing with emotion, and it becomes exhausting to watch after the first two hours. The film is very self-indulgent, and it could win the award for the most hubristic piece of cinema I've ever seen. That's where it's flawed: one gets the sense that Anderson set out to make the &quot;ultimate&quot; movie. It's all in their, every theme you could ever want. It's simply too ambitious a task to pull off.  The film also suffers from definite pretentiousness. From the frogs at the end (The Bible! duh), to certain camera angles that are far too show-offy.  On the better side, the acting is fabulous. And don't let the three hours running time scare you. It found it to move rather fast.
B00004YA66|5.0|This Movie is not just a good action story it has everything.  After seeing all these dumb movies like &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot;  This makes up for it.  Its a great story with 2 great actors.  The way things happen in the end and through the beginning is great.  I think i am the worst in rating movies because some movies the get great reviews i think it ...  but not this movie.  Its like all your favorite movies put together!! BUY THIS!
B0000028M7|5.0|this is an album that,in my opinion,influenced alot of the bands you see today that always seem to be depressed like staind or maybe even type o negative a little.Alice in Chains is most likely the darkest band to come out of seattle.Not only are they my favorite band of all time because there unbelievebly depressing,but also because theres also alot of metal in there.you can tell i like metal from my name.i know that was pointless.if you've never heard alice in chains check them out if you like stone temple pilots and pearl jam.You could say they were the most talented band to come out of Seattle,but thats kind of an opinion.but jerry cantrell's guitar playing is just brilliant and obviously layne stayley's dark,bone chilling vocals could scare the hell out of anyone if they were in a dark room by themselves.SO if your into depressing, grungy, scary, metal, buy this album.

Batman will do anything to stop mob boss &quot;The Roman&quot; and a serial killer killing his henchmen in a corrupt Gotham yet, he has a tender spot for not only &quot;Catwoman&quot; but, for &quot;Solomon Grundy born on a Monday&quot;. It is this dual persona that humanizes our hero and has made him the social icon he has been for over 60 years. You see nobody is all good or all bad and we have all thought of revenge and selfless giving at nearly the same instant. Many novel writers could study the Batman/Bruce Wayne character to learn a thing or two about character development. This is the most impressive graphic novel I have ever seen.
B00004XQP4|4.0|Ok first of all I'm gonna clear some air. Green Day never was or never will be a punk band, these are words from Billie Jo Armstrong himself.Warning is by far the best Green Day c.d. it has lyrics that accualy mean something. The band shows off their talent alot more then any of their other c.d.s.The songs (like Church on Sunday,Jackass, and Deadbeat Holiday..don't forget Warning which is one of the two singles) are better and more catchy than lots of Green Day's past efforts. This is just an overall great piece of work.
B00004Z4WQ|4.0|I, never seeing any of the Scream movies, or I Know What you did Last Summer, actully enjoyed this movie.  The most nastiest part was in the bathroom.  Well, you will have to see it for yourself.  If you dont mind people sliting other peoples necks, and people stabbing eachother, you will like this movie.  Alot of the violence has a funny side to it. Go and try this movie, I liked it and u probably will too.
0743200799|4.0|This book should have been subtitled: &quot;Mission CONTROLLERS from Mercury to Apollo 13 and Beyond&quot; because it's the story of the PEOPLE in mission control, not an explanation of how mission controllers do their jobs.  If you accept that, you won't be disappointed with the book that Mr. Kranz has written.
B00000K19E|5.0|Wow, what a movie.  The effects are unbelieveable, the story is great but a little confusing, but overall it is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  The widescreen isnt that small, so you can actually see the movie.  The special features in the movie are ok which include follow the white rabbit.  Follow the White Rabbit comes up at the bottom of the screen, you press enter, and they will show you how they shot that scene.  I like this special feature the best.  The acting is also great in this movie.  I hope to see more movies like this one in the future.
B00004Z459|5.0|This is the best CD I've heard in years.  I loved every song on this CD.  I've never skipped not one track.  The best part of this CD is that it's not overly long.  The best tracks are Papercut, One Step Closer, Points of Authority, and Pushing Me Away.  Finaly a band that writes and plays their own songs.  I am so tired of those stupid boy bands I just want to lay down and die.  The music is real not some music factory creation.  Linkin Park is a talented group which I hope will go far in this &quot;boy band&quot; society.  The money I spent on this CD was worth every penny.  I listen to this CD three times a day!  Once you purchased this awesome CD, you'll listen to it many times a day yourself.
0811826848|5.0|If a trip to the dentist was able to take George and John on their first &quot;trip&quot; into a more cosmic world, then, I say this book took me on a trip that Jules Verne coulnd't possibly &quot;imagine&quot;. I found that I coulnd't put the book down, for it enabled me to go back to a time when all I had to deal with was where I was going to get the money for the next Beatle's album....and hey, with Anthology, it is right in front of me!
B00004Z459|2.0|I bought this CD two weeks ago, instead of getting Unpluged in NY by Nirvana, thinking that it would be good. All my friends at school had said that it would be good, and I like One Step Closer, but this CD just doesn't live up to its expectations. Don't get me wrong, I like rap and rock and rap/rock, but all the songs on this CD have too much scratching and no bass!! I don't see how there could ever be a band without a bass in it. I've been waiting for this CD to grow on me, like all good CD's do, but it just hasn't. Now when I ask my friends if its good, they all say &quot;its ok, but it gets old after a few listens.&quot; And I agree whole heartedly with them. Its ok, but it gets old after a little while. I wouldn't recomend this to anyone, unless you really like scratching and don't like bass too much. I should have gotten unplugged in NY, like I was going to, and I never should have gotten this not so good CD.
B00003CXP1|5.0|Requiem for a dream is the most amazing film of the year!  I snuck into the theatre to see it.  I loved Pi and I awaited Aronofsky's 2nd film for several years.  I aspire to work with this crew.  I am writing a contraversial screenplay and I would love to have Aronofsky direct it.  The visuals in this film are like nothing I have ever seen.  The humanity of the characters is so moving.  Every parent in America should take their children to go see this movie.  I am sorry this review is so choppy.  It's late and I couldn't sleep.  Buy it, rent it, or see it any way you can.  Thumbs up
B00004Z459|5.0|Best 3 songs are the first 3 songs on the CD. Papercut is about paranoid people. One Step Closer is just cool.Good old-fashioned head-bangin, screamin'hard rock. With You, I can't tell if he likes someone or is sick of someone.This CD is cool because with most rock groups, they scream those 4-letter goodies(ex.Limp Bizkits favorite f-startin' word.).They say nothing offensive. The only thing close is when they scream &quot;Shut up When I'm Talkin' to You!!!!&quot; at the end of One-Step Closer.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|If you can't like the Beatles you need HELP!.<br />For those who don't know how important the Beatles were. Just think of it. This album will go down as the most sold album in history. It did make my &quot;YOU GOT TO HAVE IT ALBUMS&quot;. I have over 600 albums in my collection and this one did not fail to keep the Beatles fresh in my mind.<br />I grew up just outside of New York City and this album brings back the good old days of AM radio and what it took to be number one. You have to remember in those days you could not wait for the next new song by the Fab Four. <br />This is a real fresh way to hear for the first time or to remember THE BEATLES.
B00004XMS0|5.0|First and foremost, I am a huge Batfan. My favorite of the series is Batman Returns because it is the darkest. Alot of you are troubled by it because it's soooo &quot;dark&quot;. Guess what? Batman is a very dark, troubled, guy. He has issues. The first Batman is great too, Jack is the perfect actor to play the Joker. My only problem with the first one is Tim Burton didn't make the Joker darker. Batman Forever is over-the-top, yes, but Jim Carrey is a great Riddler. But, I think when Tommy Lee Jones got the script for Forever he accidently studied up on the Joker as upposed to Two Face. Tommy does a great Joker impression throughout the movie. True Batfans know that Two Face is much more reserved and cold. Finally, Batman &amp; Robin. I will admit that Bane was used and abused in this movie! What were they thinking when they cast Bane as a goofy limmo driver? They could've made a whole Movie out of the Knightfall series, but they blew it! Knightfall would have been perfect, we could've had ALL the former villians back in one giant movie! Nice going guys! But, I accept Batman &amp; Robin because you all don't. I'm waiting for the day when Tim Burton and Michael Keaton return and fulfill every Batfans dream.....a new movie! Come back to us Tim! I'll even write the script, do you want dark? You got it, how about The Scarecrow (played by Gary Oldman) and Manbat (CGI Manbat and The Dr. played by Johnny Depp.) Sound good Tim? Music by Danny Elfman, huh? You all can argue over who will play the roles, but I just want a NEW MOVIE NOW!!!
0811826848|5.0|I hate to read anything that is not real or true. This book I can't stop reading. I have several books on the Beatles and this one is great.<br />What is so good about this is they all talk about the same topic. You feel you get the whole story with no edits from music critics or the such. Just the Fab Four reliving what took place with them.<br />It also has great pictures to keep you up to speed. Easy to understand what was in their minds. If you only get one book on the Beatles THIS IS THE ONE.
0743201140|4.0|As a manager, perhaps one of our greatest challenges is juggling the uniqueness of our employees.  It's not our job to fix them, rather it's our job to facilitate their success.<br />I agree with what &quot;First, Break All the Rules&quot; said, in that, we should seek to build the strengths of our employees rather than fix their weaknesses.  But, I walked away from that book saying &quot;ok, that was great, but how do you determine a strength or talent?&quot;  <br />&quot;Now, Discover your Strengths&quot; gives practical insights on the strengths and inate talents of people.  I was impressed by this and also by the real life examples of people displaying the stregth being discussed.  The disheartening thing about the test is that it only gives your top 5 strengths when it's likely that 8-10 strenths are outwardly shown (in my opinion).<br />Unlike other readers, I DID NOT see this and the online test as meant to be a &quot;personality&quot; test.  Quite the contrary.  I believe it accurately measures what it says it does:  STRENGTHS.  <br />I'm looking forward to applying this information to the organizations I work with.<br />Since my question after reading the first book (how do you determine someone's strenghts?) was answered with &quot;Now Discover your Strenthgs&quot;, I'm guessing that if there is a third book, it will discuss what to do with your strengths now that they're discovered.
B00003Q43A|5.0|I haven't seen the SPECIAL EDITION DVD, but if you want to know if the movie itself is good, trust me, it's good. I've also heard it has a lot of cool extras. If you're a science fiction fan and have a good home theater system with DVD, I highly recommend this one.
B000003TA4|4.0|Before this album, most mainstream music sucked. Nirvana ushered in an era of incorporating the music of miscreant american subcultures into the mainstream.Nirvana brought a certain emotion into the music of the late eighties and early nineties of which most popular music, the products of heartless corporate machines, was completely devoid.Nirvanas genius is in their characteristic free association, which is quite prevalent in Nevermind as well as other albums. The music of Nirvana is not only a scathing intellectual satire of the decadent faults of society, but it is simultaneously an ode to human emotion and turmoil that was slowly destroying Cobain's mind when he wrote the album. Long story short, buy the album, it rules!
0399146253|2.0|While I am not an avid Dr. Scarpetta fan I have enjoyed some of her books. I found this to be a difficult read. I had read the prior story so was familiar with the protagonist. The time spent delving into Dr. Scarpetta's psyche was way too long. The energy spent in self analysis and paranoia was way too much for my taste.
078611262X|5.0|Feynman's thinking style is not \\"linear.\\" This is the reason he was able to break out of the box, and make the profound breakthroughs that were his mark. One anecdote after another illustrates this in a most enjoyable and enlightening way.<br />For example, as a lad he wanted to learn real mathematics. The librarian wouldn't allow him to borrow advanced math books, so he said they were for someone else, someone older. Reading book after book, he taught himself mathematics. He ended up learning some advanced math uniquely his way. Years later, while still in graduate school, he was recruited to work on the Manhattan project (which developed the atom bomb). When other mathematicians who used conventional math treatments were stumped, Feynman was able to make breakthrough using a math style unique to him-non-linear.<br />And, by the way, quantum mechanics is not linear, either. This was one of the most enjoyable reads ever.
6305508550|5.0|This movie made an almost &quot;psychic&quot; connection with me... the first time I saw it, I had just come home from my nightmare job -- many of the same things depicted in the movie had happened to me that very day, including the printer jam with that exact message &quot;Error - PC Load Letter&quot;, while trying to print a report that was already late (what the heck does that message mean, anyway?!).  <br />I related so well to this movie's honest, astute, and technically correct observations of office culture in the 90's, that the brilliantly original bits of commedy were almost incidental to me (I must have annoyed the heck out of my wife with outbursts like &quot;Oh my GOD, that's so TRUE!&quot; every two minutes).  I caught some of the more subtle humor in subsequent viewings.  <br />I'll admit, the movie lost its hold on me about 2/3 in, when the main character (who had by this time become an icon to me with his new found &quot;no fear of consequences&quot; attitude) took a strange criminal direction, and his angst began to return.  This seemed to break the consistancy.  I wan't too thrilled with Jenifer Aniston's performance either, although I suppose that had more to do with her script.  In any case, the second time I watched the move, none of this bothered me as much.<br />I've since purchased the DVD, and have worn this disk out playing it for friends.  I'll never get tired of this movie... even the sound track makes me laugh.  It's a wonder that it didn't get better reviews, although I guess one really would have had to have experienced office politics in the 90's to fully relate (I wonder when was the last time in the 90's that Ebert heard, &quot;Don't forget to fill in your timesheets!&quot;)<br />Some reviewers gave it low ratings claiming that it was &quot;lightweight&quot;... okay, so it's no Citizen Kane, but it certainly doesn't claim to be either!  Give it credit for what it is -- as a lighthearted observational commedy, it's brilliant.  And that's not to say that it was a total no-brainer either... on an intelligence level, I'd rate it much higher than say... any movie ever made by the Fairley Brothers (and certainly much lower on the &quot;obnoxious bathroom humor&quot;-scale).<br />It's a pretty sad testiment to the intelligence of the average North American that movies like &quot;Me, Myself, and Irene&quot; brought in more money than Office Space.  I hope Mike Judge doesn't let this stop him from creating another gem.
B000056WTM|5.0|The Philadelphia Story is an amazing film. It is based on the play by Phillip Barry and chronicles the last couple of days before Tracy Samantha Lord (Katharine Hepburn) is to be married. She had been previously married to C.K. Dexter Haven (Cary Grant) and he is forced into blackmailing Ms. Lord for the purpose of letting two reporters (Ruth Hussey in an excellent supporting role and James Stewart in a flawless, Academy Award winning performance) from the Tabloid &quot;Spy Magazine&quot; into the Lord home to cover the wedding. The reporters do not know that they have been found out for who they are and thus begins a marvelous game involving psychological and class warfare, romance, and even a little drunkedness. Incredible perfomances especially by Hepburn, Grant, and Stewart as well as a terrific screenplay and superb direction from George Cukor make The Philadelphia Story easily one of the best films in American History. If you are a fan of any of the three big stars in this film and have not bought this yet, I enthusiastically recommend that you do so today!
0375500901|5.0|Daniel Silva carefully researched the &quot;annals&quot; of mid-east epionage and came up with a story that captures the machinations and duplicity that are the foundation of Israeli-PLO relations. At the end of this story I was not sure exactly who the &quot;Kill Artist&quot; was, as each side does its best to physically remove anyone who might be a threat to its survival or even to the cause of peace. Peace becomes so far more fragile than we have recognized. Silva makes it clear that in each camp there are those that consider peace negotiations to be a capitulation or a threat rather than the start of a brand new day. In this respect, the author is not one-sided and presents both sides of a very difficult issue. <br />Pertinent to present day politics, one does get to meet certain characters that resemble the controversial Mark Rich. I could not help but think that if this presentation is accurate, it is not hard to understand why Israel was so insistent on a pardon for this man.<br />I recommend The Kill Artist with only one reservation: make sure you have nothing important to tend to when you start this book as you will not be able to put it down!
B000007MVL|5.0|This is a great album, second only to The Kick Inside.  It is Kate at her most endearing.  Bush is an artist whose best work was her earliest, most naive.  Don't pass this one up!
B000053V7O|1.0|Dexter Gordon's voice is terrible to hear all allong this movie. The French actor plays a stupid fanatic who forgets he has a life. This whole story might be true but the voice is terrible and the rythm of the movie is sloooow.  I bought this movie because of your review but after I had seen it I returned it to the store to exchanged it.  Compare this movie to Bird or Mo better blues and you will give those two movies a 10.  With all due respect to Dexter Gordon's musical genius, Tavernier should have chosen an actor with a better voice. Typical french movies, they throw things at you that you must like beacause it is supposed to be deep and intellectual. Wrong. as Serge Dassault inventor of the Mirage jet fighter once said: &quot; a plane can be technically the best, but without beauty it isn't a plane.
0790729628|3.0|I just wanted to say that whoever gave this movie a score of four in the sound category (see above) needs to get with the program.  This is one of the best Sci-Fi movies of all time and all it's given is a lousy Dolby 2.0 track instead of a nice Dolby 5.1.  The picture quality is excellent but they need to release a new disc with an updated audio track in either 5.1 or DTS.

B00003CXAY|5.0|I think the producers of Koyaanisqatsi should clean this movie up using the latest movie technology for the big screen and put it back out in a limited nationwide re-release to movie theaters.<br />Imagine how well the movie would do with today's theater sound systems and improved screen projection quality.<br />I know the movie would cash-in with today's more educated and affluent movie going public.  Then it should go to DVD widescreen and VHS release.<br />I did not know how rare this excellent video has become. Fortunately, I still have my original legit copy on VHS and it is still in great shape.
B000001FRY|5.0|This is an important album. U2 has many great songs, but what is special about this album is the way it ties together. It is best listened to as a whole. To listen to it while driving through a late night rain shower is fantastic! Perhaps it is a bit unpolished, but it is full of raw talent and vision and emotion, and is most significant if one realizes the time in which it came out. This album was done before U2 knew they were U2! Steve Lillywhite, who produced it, also did an amazing job. A must, especially for those who like to evaluate a whole album, instead of the few 'hits' it may produce.
B00004XQ83|5.0|I haven't seen the movie -- YET!  However, I bought this CD because I am a great fan of bluegrass, gospel, old time folk music.  This CD has roots.  I think no matter what your background is, where you come from, the music on this CD brings back memories, or should, anyway.  I especially love Alison Kraus' &quot;Down in the River to Pray&quot;.  I've not heard a more beautiful version of that song ever.  Gillian Welch and Alison do a wonderful job on &quot;I'll Fly Away&quot;.  &quot;Angel Band&quot; needs no reviews; the Stanley brothers do an amazing job on that cut.  The Whites, The Cox Family, Emmylou Harris, Dan Tyminski, Norman Blake, are all superb on this soundtrack.  Bluegrass rules, most of us know that but I believe this CD is going to help those who have not had an appreciation for this music to have a new outlook on the music that really shaped America.  Whether or not you have seen the film, the soundtrack will take you back in time.
B00003CWL6|1.0|I do not own &amp; will never own this film.  I saw it on HBO.  I was not thrilled to see about half the cast drop their clothes.  The Insider should have been best picture over this mess.
630469654X|4.0|I have always loved this movie.  My one complaint is the musical score - what were they thinking?!?  The music is so inappropriate to the genre as to be almost laughable ... if it did not distract so much from the overall quality of the picture.  I would give it five stars if it weren't for the score.  However, the story and the cinematography are quality enough to offset the aural assault (though the special effects are very 1985).  Mathhew Broderick is endearing, Rutger Hauer moody and Michelle Pfieffer is ... well ... Michelle Pfeiffer.  A great film.
0767817710|4.0|I did like the film more than I expected.  Russell did his usual great job.  Was glad to have the film letterboxed.  Wish Sharon could have kept her clothes on.
B00000JPH5|4.0|Okay, people have been telling me to watch this for years.  I must say, it is worth watching.  It's a well done fantasy, as only Jim Henson can do it.  It reminds me a lot of the Alice books.  The music really lends to the atmosphere, although I can't quite make sense of how some of the songs fit into the story line (e.g. the song in the Escher setting).  David Bowie is really freaky, especially with his tight pants and wacky hair.  It's a very eighties movie.
B00005A1PR|5.0|Without india.arie's earthy ballads to goosebump my soul everyday, I go into hysterics! The Bamboozled soundtrack with india.arie's &quot;You're Always In My Head&quot; and enticing snips of sample music from her cd, hooked me enough to hunt for more of her music.  &quot;Brown Skin&quot; curls my toes, rolls my eyes to the back of my head, and makes me sound a lot like I do when I'm with that &quot;special someone&quot; about that &quot;special business&quot;.  Smooth, surprising and never obtuse, ms. india.arie has convinced me to become a lifelong fan of her music.
B000007ODM|5.0|the original cd that made era very well-known in europe.<br />ipicked up the cd in paris in '98, but i encouraged a friend of mine topick it up.. <br />anyhow, this cd is a must-have.  if you're into european-medieval mixed with modern day new age music, this disc is absolutely brilliant.  the choir always sings in latin, though most of the lead vocals are in english.  i really like the way the synths are brought in with the choir, and the guitar playing is also very well done<br />it also includes the mastercard advert theme &quot;ameno&quot; that was aired during france '98 world cup football tournament<br />i must say that unlike other phony new age music, eric levi (who is on both synths and guitar) truly did a magnificant job, you will enjoy every single track on this disc, though 'avemano' sorta put me to sleep!

6304595247|5.0|(The book was better, of course) but this movie is one of my new favourites. The actors are all superb, the music is wonderful, and the scenery is breathtaking. It's true to the book (as true as can be) and the added in stuff is all in character. This one (unlike the 1939 version) actually includes the whole book, and Heathcliff seems real. In the 1939's version, he was too nice. They didn't come close to portraying his demonic nature. In this one, they do. This movie's greatest scene is the scene when Nelly comes to Heathcliff,bringing news of Cathy's death. Heathcliff's voice and expression as he curses cathy-- it's heartwrenching and real. You just have to see it.
0812589041|5.0|This is an awesome book.  Everyone that I have talked to that has read it has really connected with the character Ender.
0767903854|4.0|I have read all of Bryson's books, and admire his work tremendously. He writes with wit and clarity, and I sometimes find it hard to contain my laughter.  \\"In A Sunburned Country\\" is well written, and Bryson obviously spent an extensive amount of time traveling through the country, but it lacked something for me in terms of depth.<br />Perhaps it is because the other places he has written about are countries or areas where he has extensive understanding of the culture and colloquialisms that he is less of a tourist and more of a commentator.  In this book, while he does play the role of commentator, he is also a tourist. <br />If you have not read Bryson before, start with \\"Notes From A Small Island,\\" or \\"A Walk In The Woods.\\" Both of these books in my opinion are better examples of his wonderful style.  If you have read Bryson before and enjoy his writing, you will probably enjoy this book, but will also be anxiously awaiting his next and hoping it is as good as his earlier books.
B00003CXDV|4.0|I really enjoyed this film.  Glad I bought the DVD. Good extras &amp; was glad to get the film letterbox.
B0000524E5|1.0|I'm all for a light entertaining movie but this thing was painful to watch. Mix Piper Perabo as the lead role, a bubble headed blond who couldn't act to save her life, add an old hashed to death storyline embedded with every cliche in the book and you have Coyote Ugly. This thing was horrible, just horrible. After the first five minutes I got sick of watching Perabo's only acting skill making those sad puppy dog faces. But guess what it goes on the rest of the movie, must be a record for that annoying facial expression. It's a good thing this is a rental so I can send it back tomorrow, if I was suckered into buying this disc I would have to drench it with gasoline and set it on fire.
B00004Y6Q5|5.0|I just recieved this disc in the mail. I'm already in love with it! To tell you the truth, I haven't even seen the movie, but if it's half as good as the CD, then I'm in for a treat.<br />My favroite track is #31 &quot;Meltdown&quot;. It shows such raw, emotional power, that you can't help but be stunned. Other highlights are &quot;Lux Aeterna&quot;, &quot;Marion Barfs&quot;, &quot;The Beginning of the End&quot;, and &quot;Summer Overture&quot; to name only a few.<br />I enjoy music that shows emotion. And Clint Mansell's score is powerful, grating, edgy, and nerve-racking. I enjoy it immensely. A very good point of the CD is that it gets progressivly darker as it goes on. &quot;Summer Overture&quot; isn't all too cheery, but it holds a glimmer of hope. And by &quot;Meltdown&quot;, you've been hurled into a world of nervous breakdowns, schizophrnia and catatonia. Or at least that's how I envision it.<br />Definitly worth the money even if you haven't seen the film. It's definitly the most powerful score I've ever listened to. And one of the most beautiful.
B000000OF6|5.0|With out a doupt in my mind, this is one of my favorite bands of all time!! There have been several bands that I have listend to and liked and then got sick of them after a while, but Queen is NOT one of them! They have maid music for almost every kind of taste ,because they have done almost every thing from classical rock to orchestra rock to hard rock! Almost everyone who hears a few Queen songs are moved by its Awsome beat and harmony! I have introduced Queen to all of my freinds, ( even Korn &amp; Metalica fans such as my self) and ALL of them ended up becoming fans! Freddy Murcery is a awsome and VERY uniqe vocalist! And every one of these guys are great musicians! Brian May is a outstanding gutar player with a style that hasn't been adopted by any other gutar player,that I know of! If you lission closley to his sound, it is VERY HARD to imatate! Roger Taylor and John Deacon are also very good! Queen has left a powerfull legacy that will never be forgotten! I must admit, I was pretty disterbed for a while that I got the impression that Queen is a gay band, but who cares??! That dosent bother me anymore! They have rocked us! and without a doupt in my mind if old Freddy didint die, they would still be making music today! Personaly my favorites are Another One Bites The Dust,, I Want To Break Free, Bicycle Race and I Want It All. Tch! It's stupid of me to list all my favorites because I LOVE THEM ALL! This Gratist Hitz set is very good for those wo want a overall sound of the band. Each song is taken out of a differnt album from the first to thelast! However, this Gratist hitz set still misses alot of thier awsome songs, but hey, It's hard to pick out the best ones! I am a heavy metal fan,even though Queen dosn't do any heavy metal music,a few come close and I still love thier music! I enjoy it and I'm sure you will to! ENJOY!

B000002H2H|5.0|Obviously as you know, MetallicA is one of the greatest (I say the greatest), heavy metal band in the world. Or at least they used to be, until the passing away of Cliff Burton. This album being their second but the first to a musical thrash metal extent is the greatest in history. All of the songs are great except with track 5 and 6 being of lesser strength. I really have to hand it to Kirk Hammett on this album though because he does not get the proper attention he deserves. He has the guitaring of a god which can only be compared to Hendrix or Page, and in &quot;Ride The Lightning&quot;, you will be amazed at his 1:30 solo which is played with tremendous speed. I thought it to be a mistake that the singing is done by Dave Mustaine who was booted from the band because Hetfield is a better singer by far. If you do not like this album after your purchase, then all I have to say is you shouldn't have even tried to understand metal in the first place because this album is only for people that love the feeling expressed from a guitar. Most of all MetallicA songs have solos that express a lot of feeling, but I hope you enjoy the guitaring in this album the most, as well as the lyrics. And also be sure to check out &quot;Master Of Puppets&quot; sometime, to find MetallicA at their peak in 1985. Thanks, from another MetallicA fan.
6305537313|5.0|Audrey's grace, style, and beauty on screen is amazing.  She commands a presence and yet a subtle vulnerability that's extremely enamoring.  I love the reckless abandon which comes across in Hepburn's portrayal of Holly.  Holly is so naive, and yet very wise in her own ways.  Her character is what drives this movie.  I love watching her and the way she carries herself.  The movie is pretty good, but it's Audrey Hepburn that you won't be able to take your eyes off of.
B000003TA4|5.0|Yes I'm starting from scratch. My last review of this was controversial &amp; angry, regrettable. But I read thru the reviews again &amp; though I see some intelligent bits of writings, there's still a sea of both lovestruck fans &amp; cynical assholes either from the stadium muso wanker scene or the harder than hardcore punk scene. I consider myself a well rounded listener &amp; Nevermind is an old favourite. I don't consider it to be necessarily the most amazing bit of music ever, but I think it's still interesting enough. It stands @ the crossroads of an extremely commercial product &amp; a deeply smart &amp; worthwhile work of art. On each side [&amp; KC believed in records still having 2 sides] you have 5 electric tunes &amp; 1 acoustic to end it off. I like Nirvana but don't care for Pearl Jam, Smashing Pumpkins, or Led Zeppelin. If you're using the argument that the trio weren't virtuoso musicians, which they never ever claimed to be, I suggest forgeting boring whiteboy rawk &amp; listen to JAZZ where you can have people who can play like hell &amp; have the energy/emotion/depth of a Cobain [i.e. Miles, Ornette etc]. I think the production does work well here although I think using the same team of Butch Vig &amp; Andy Wallace destroyed Sonic Youth's Dirty the next year, their worst sounding album. Nevermind is 'classic' as anything could ever be, naturally if it's the only thing you expose yrself to you'll get bored of it but it's still a fine record indeed. I have never been a casual music listener so I can't look @ things from the same perspective as a lot of you, I just say you should explore further, some albums of similar greatness in modern rock include The Fall's Grotesque, Sonic youth's Sister &amp; Pavement's Slanted and Enchanted. Or you could go on doing whatever, nevermind.
B000002MY3|3.0|This cd honestly grows tiring if listened to regularly.  It is definitely good enough to be pulled off the shelf every couple of months and listened to another time, however.  I love the energy on this album.  I usually listen to it while working out, for the lyrics such as &quot;it's easier not to...so much easier not to...and what goes around never comes around to you&quot; drive me forward.  I suppose my real problem with this cd is that Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie is just so much better.  While this cd has anger and wit, Supposed Former has an introspective quality that makes me think about myself in a new way every time i listen to it.  Jagged Little Pill is a good album, but when picking one over the other, Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie ranks high above this freshman effort.
0395389496|5.0|In my opinion The Polar Express was a wonderful children's book. Children would love the simple story line, the excellent illustrations, and the descriptiveness of the writing. This story is very simple for the young readers short attention span. Although descriptive the author says exactly what he wants. Next, the illustratons are wonderfuly done. Along with the illustrative words the pictures show exactly what the author meant. Lastly, The author uses words that put an excellent picture into your mind, before you even take a glance at the illustrations. In colclusion, with its elaborations and simpleness this book makes a superb story for any young child.
0767817478|3.0|Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich passed on this film the first time they were offered. Why? Why didn't they keep passing?! Contrary to popular belief that the acting or story killed this movie (I've seen great popcorn movies with worse acting and even lamer story), it was the whole idea that this duo based the film around - Godzilla is a fast, hiding smart creature who must defend it's brood of babies and constantly run throughout Manhattan and yes, throughout the whole film. Devlin stated that they wanted to go back to Godzilla's roots...ha! Ha, ha, HA! Did they ever watch the original? Godzilla represents an unstoppable force of nature, a punishment to mankind for his aganizing and terrible rape of mother nature. Godzilla couldn't be stopped by any conventional weapon, couldn't feel pain, sorrow or remourse. He was a 55 meter tall Terminator! Until finally it took one brave, misunderstood mans sacrifice to end the rest of the world's horror (ironically, very similar to The Terminator...). This Godzilla is an allegory for absolutely nothing, just a CGI created wonder without dimension or provocation.  And that's the problem, this Godzilla isn't Godzilla! You might as well call the movie a Superman remake because it makes just as much sense! Godzilla is supposed to stand for something, which is the reason for his popularity in Japan. True G-Fans see this as well, and that's why this...creature(!) is not our Big G.  The whole thing would be solved if this film was a remake of Ray Harryhausen's classic The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms. Beast was a great film, and it stood for something too. Convienently, it stood for what this &quot;Godzilla&quot; stands for: Careful how you treat our planet, it might fight back... Truth be told, most of the movie resmbles scenes from Beast, so why on earth call it Godzilla? Patrick Tatapolous' design for the creature is wonderful! Reptilian, proud, sleek and striking, and if the rest of the movie had been treated so well, I think that fans at least would have been a little more forgiving towards the change.  Not to poor salt on an open wound, but the original director was to be Jan De Bont, who had just come off Speed and Twister. Both of which have the force-of-nature, indestructable-unstoppable rush to them. When I die, I'll ask God to show me what that film would have been like...
0345409671|5.0|I've read every book in the vampire chronicles, and this was defintly one of my favorites. Lestat is back, and charming as ever! He's my favorite, so I'm biased. =)<br />I found the idea that the Devil isn't evil fascinating. Who would have thought? And the true reason that God kicked him out of heaven very thought provoking. <br />The end was just as good as the other books, and kept me wanting to read more in the series. I can't wait to read Merrick. <br />Definetly a must read!!!
B00003CWPR|1.0|Plan 9 From Outer Space had a more comprehensible plot, and held my attention better, too.<br />Tom Cruise seemed very concerned about something through much of the movie -- probably that it took 2 years to shoot this baffling, meandering mess.  Oh, I suppose the intelligentsia can sip double decaf espressos and ponder the deeper meaning of it all, but I'll take a Top Gun over this snoozer any day.
B000059R8Y|5.0|This is an amazing album and a terrific follow up to Riding with the King. This is a must have for any Clapton Fan and it is great to listen to the changes in Clapton's music from Blindfaith, the Yardbirds and Cream, to his brand new music. Clapton still is the best after all these years!
B00003CXC7|5.0|The last few years have seen some classic films that have been given back their old lustre via restoration, including such films as, My Fair Lady, Vertigo, Lawrence Of Arabia to name just a few. These films as well as this film have been restored by the restoration mavericks Robert A. Harris, and James Katz.<br />I must say after seeing an advance copy of this film that Rear Window looks incredible, especially compared to the Laser Disc copy I have as well as the poor copies that have been showing up on television and VHS over the years.<br />The colors are vibrant, in particular the reds which don't give a hint of bleeding into the frame, and the image looks I imagine as close to the original as possible given the fact that this film is almost fifty years old now.<br />The aspect ratio is 1.66:1 which is the proper framing for this film, the sound is the original mono soundtrack and has been scrubbed up to remove any audio imperfections that have built up over the years.<br />Also included on this disc is a 55 minute documentary titled, Rear Window Ethics:Remembering a Hitchock Classic which is quite enjoyable.<br />There is a still frame gallery, a shorter documentary with the screenwriter John Michael Hayes, as well as the standard fare of biographies, filomgraphies etc.<br />All in all a quite impressive package and should be of interest to any Hitchcock fan as well as Cinema fans in general.
6303369170|5.0|It is really wonderful movie and I have seen it about ten times. I never get bored. I can watch it every day of my life...
B000002BPS|5.0|What a good CD this is! This has incredibly clever lyrics, combined with some great guitars and Dexter's &quot;my head is in a toilet&quot; vocals. The best songs are, &quot;Gone Away,&quot; &quot;Amazed,&quot; and, &quot;All I Want.&quot; It has only one bad song, &quot;Don't Pick it Up,&quot; but the rest are awesome. It is too bad that Americana and Conspiracy of One are so bad. The Offspring really were a good Punk band until they had to make up these unintelligent saracastic songs, which sound closer to some crap you would find on TRL.
B000035Z3K|4.0|This disc is the absolute high water mark for this Universal classic. It contains three films: the original 1931 version, the Spanish language production, and an alternate version of the original featuring a score by famed composer Phillip Glass. There is also an excellent documentary by David Skal that examines both the source novel and its movie adaptation and the impact it had on the genre as well as its star creation.<br />The original film itself is a tad creaky, which only strengthens arguments that director Tod Browning really did not care all that much about the project, however Lugosi is nothing but brilliant as the Count. The sauve yet predatory dignity he brought to the part might seem a tad campy if taken out of context, but in the movie as a whole it is simply stunning. Dwight Frye as Renfield and Edward Van Sloan as Van Helsing also contribute incredible performances.  The Glass score did nothing for me and seemed out of place, being far too contemporary in sound to really enhance such an old film.  The spanish language version is, technically speaking, better made than Browning's, but it lacks the powerful presence of an actor like Lugosi and runs a bit long at nearly an hour and forty minutes.<br />Universal as done a superb job with this disc.  The Count could not have gotten better treatment.  It is an essential for any horror fan's, or movie buff's for that matter, film library.  Required.
0790729350|3.0|Woodstock has some very good performances (actually Santana, fairly unknown outside of San Francisco at the time, is arguably the best) interspersed with a lot of very dreary hippie propaganda. One must immediately view Gimme Shelter as an antidote after this film.
B00004U30D|1.0|If you were touched deeply (HA!) by the motif of &quot;beauty in the ordinary&quot;, then go read Joyce's &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot;, which has in it a much deeper, genuine explanation of true beauty. This movie is hyperbole, a  of easy answers that have a much greater assumed context than is developed in the film. By no means is it a masterpiece. The hype about it is just a flock of sheep proving that strength in numbers does, though it shouldn't, work.<br />&quot;And when at times the mob is swayed /  to carry praise or blame too far /  we may choose something like a star /  to keep our minds on and be staid.&quot;<br />Joyce is luminous. Read it and discover REAL beauty.
B000056K04|5.0|When I first listened to the CD, I striked it off as changing too much into a rock and roll style that didn't have any of the calm, beautiful DMB songs that I go for.  Well, I was right; it didn't really.  However, upon a 2nd listen I discovered that it didn't matter; the CD was beautiful anyway.  Though most of the songs do have more of a rock appeal, they still retain many facets that make them Dave.  Many of the songs have generally mellow verses contrasted by rock-ish refrains.  This CD is a lot louder than his previous ones.   A majority of the songs are uplifting and exude a sense of fresh happiness that makes you want to smile.  They really show off Dave's wonderful voice and lyrical ability.  So Right, and When The World Ends, are perfect examples of why I think the CD is so great, even though it is different.
0679731725|5.0|A lot of literary types babble on about levels way too much.  I usually don't buy it, it's just a way to sound smart or justify a career made of criticizing books rather than writing them.  <br />This book has levels!  I'm not talking about the inventions of pseudo-intellectuals, but real levels that I enjoyed discovering as I read.  At it's most basic, it's a very sweet, tender yet tragic love story.  It's also a fascinating character study.  It's an interesting political story.  It's a discussion of a culture, a dying culture.  Finally, and at it's heart, it's about human conformity, philosophically and practically.  What happens to one who's only concern is duty?  <br />That's a pretty important question.  Remains of the Day asks it gently and answers it with open ends.  <br />This was the first book that made me cry.  I recommend this book without qualification
B000002WYT|1.0|I had to invent a new genre of music to describe Dave Matthews Band: I call it progressive pop.  It is boring, over-blown, and pretentious like progressive rock but it is mindless and aimed at the lowest common denominator like 90s pop.  <br />You know, if they played this live just as it appears on the lp it would be okay, i suppose.  Live performances (or better yet, in their own garage) are the RIGHT place to experiment, show-off their musical prowess, and to just relax.  An lp is the place to concentrate and play well-conceived, concise, fully-formed songs.     Dave Matthews Band is the Eagles of this generation.  (Sorry, Eagles).  They're laid back, safe, and boring.  In other words, they're an affront to everything rock'n'roll is supposed to stand for.  <br />Somebody needs to buy these guys a punk album.  Or maybe take away their millions so they have the opportunity to live life so they can experience some real human emotions so they don't just write about uninspired drivel.<br />   Good luck, Dave and the boys.  good luck, Dave Matthews Band fans: please smarten up and try to find something that's more interesting than the crap your parents listen to.
1558908358|3.0|&quot;Tron&quot; is an intriguing glimpse at how futurism, and computers, and technology, were viewed almost 20 years ago.  For me, it captures the romance of the computer age, when people still crowded video arcades to play &quot;Pac Man,&quot; and when the possibilities of the emerging technology seemed limitless.  The film is most interesting from a stylistic standpoint -- the production design amounts to an artful vision of a &quot;virtual&quot; world that predates William Gibson's &quot;Neuromancer&quot; and indeed the whole pop-culture concept of &quot;cyberspace.&quot;<br />Yet there are other layers as well.  Like &quot;The Matrix,&quot; &quot;Tron&quot; has an allegorical dimension -- in this case, it happens to be a Christ allegory.  Flynn, the Jeff Bridges character, comes from the upper world of the Users (gods) to mingle with the lowly Programs (people) and redeem them from the evil Master Control Program.  The most remarkable scene in the film may be the one where Tron goes to the I/O tower and communicates with his User.  It's a moment of religious revelation, like Moses meeting the burning bush atop Mt. Sinai.<br />Unfortunately, in terms of sheer nuts-and-bolts storytelling, as well as dialogue and characterization, &quot;Tron&quot; is not that well executed.  It has neither the pizazz of &quot;Star Wars&quot; nor the gorgeous stylishness of &quot;Blade Runner.&quot;  Still, it's an intriguing and forward-thinking film, and the musical score by Wendy Carlos (of &quot;Switched On Bach&quot; fame) is excellent.
B0000019PA|5.0|I want to tell you: the first time I heard this CD, I was quite disappointed. Why? Exceptionally high expectations. Here's the scoop. I went to see Superchunk in Pittsburgh a few years back and the groop opening for them was Neutral Milk Hotel. Now, I had heard the name and read a few things about them here and there and, while they sounded interesting, they didn't really sound like my kind of thing. So here I am at the show and I'm watching Neutral Milk Hotel and I'm seeing what was and continues to be the best live band I've ever seen and Superchunk, while fun, simply paled in comparison. As soon as I had money, I ran out and bought In The Aeroplane Over The Sea, thoroughly expecting the live Neutral Milk Hotel experience to be magically transported part and parcel into my living room and of COURSE I was disappointed (what did I expect). But I gave it another chance and, ah, there it was, the magic hidden deeper within than it had been when I was ten feet from Jeff Mangum and Co. but still oh so present. To this day, ITAOTS remains one of the very few albums to bring me to tears every time I hear it. Absolutely fantabulous.
B00004RFFU|5.0|&quot;Interview With The Vampire&quot; is an intriguing movie that looks deeper into the vampire than any other film involving these mysterious creatures.  Instead of being portrayed as heartless killers as in most other vampire films, &quot;Interview&quot; shows a new side, a compassionate side capable of feelings, including love.<br />As the plot progresses, the audience becomes connected with the characters it reveals.  Louis, the main character, becomes especially easy to connect with because the audience can easily find parts of themselves within him.  Louis is a very troubled vampire, continually struggling with himself.  On one side, his instincts guide him to survive, but, on the other side, his gentle heart forbids him to partake in the evil deeds necessary to do so.  This internal conflict that Louis eternally faces symbolizes the choices and judgments each human must deal with everyday.<br />Louis, along with vampires Lestat, Claudia, and Armand, also symbolize the outsider, the misunderstood person that lives within every man and woman.  When Louis boldly tells the interviewer, &quot;I'm flesh and blood, but not human,&quot; he is saying that although people are not all alike, they all must face trials in life, and all have the ability to feel the same emotions as each other. This statement represents the theme of the entire movie.<br />Although &quot;Interview&quot; is probably not for everyone, I gave it a five star rating for its unique portrayal of vampires, and of life.  Although the plot might not appeal to everybody, anybody should be able to appreciate depth in the characters, and the film as a whole.
0393317552|2.0|Despite his erudition, Jared fails to support his thesis, which is that technological societies developed opportunistically and that race was not a factor.  It is a thesis that is impossible to prove.<br />If a racial group, given a set of propitious circumstances, develops advanced technology, that does not, and can not, prove that another racial group in the same situation would also advance.<br />It is a well-written book but panders to current ideology.
0060245867|5.0|Hi!  My name is Michelle and I am going to write a review for &quot;If You Give A Mouse A Cookie.&quot;  I thought that this book is a very good book.  Some of the reasons to why I like this book is as follows.  This book is cute.  What I mean by cute is that this book is about a little mouse and a cookie.  Well this whole book is cute because it is a happy kind of book.  Also I like this book because I like the content.  The content of this book is easily understandable and a little kid can read this book very easily.  The last reasons to why I like this book is that the pictures are cool.  The pictures in this book are cool because they are small and cute.  Well thats all the time that I have left.  I hope that whoever reads my review reads this book and then reads the story:)
6305282927|2.0|The music in this is, of course, absolutely wonderful.  But the story and the acting are simply atrocious.  It may just be that it hasn't aged well - and I AM willing to put up with bad acting and scripts to hear good music - hence my love for &quot;The Music Man&quot;, &quot;West Side Story&quot;, &quot;Oliver&quot;, etc.  But this exercise in stereotypes was just painful.  Nice photography, though.

0393317552|2.0|If you are interested in this book, I would strongly urge you to buy his previous book _The Third Chimpanzee_ instead. _Guns, Germs, and Steel_ is merely a book length explication of the ideas contained in one 30 page chapter of that book. Unfortunately, padding them out to 350 pages didn't add much in the way of depth or interest to the ideas. Instead, Diamond goes through and repeats the same basic points 6 or 7 times over the course of this longer work. His writing quickly grew tedious as no new ideas emerged after page 40 or so--merely more repetitive hammering home of the basic points.<br />Not that the core idea--that local biological factors had a decisive influence on the rise of early civiliations--isn't compelling. It is a fascinating perspective. But it's ultimately not enough to carry the entire book, and Diamond really has little else to offer. With _The Third Chimpanzee_ you get the same ideas plus about 15 other ideas almost equally interesting.
B00003CXE6|2.0|One of my favorite movies of all time is Braveheart and I had heard such glowing reviews of Gladiator and often comparisons to Braveheart that I couldn't wait to see it. I found it mostly boring. The storyline never caught me....I never felt for the character Russel Crowe played (though he was GREAT in the Insider). Joaquin Phoenix did make a pretty good &quot;bad guy&quot; but overall I was disappointed.
0671042858|5.0|A great short story from the master of writing.  King does some of his best work when keeping the story short and too the point.  Something for everyone not too scary and not too big just right for a quick 1 to 2 night read.
B00000J7S8|5.0|This is the altimate female jazz vocalist.  If you like jazz at any level, you will fall in love with this album.....trust me
B00003CXDG|4.0|A fast paced movie with more intrigue than most shows would dare to put together.  The twist and turns will keep you on your feet and at times is somewhat confusing.  A good movie, yes, a great movie, No.
B0000027I6|4.0|Amused to Death is Roger Waters' most accomplished and pleasing solo work to date. Surprisingly some material on this album was written and even recorded during breaks from his previous album's (Radio KAOS) tour. In a change for the better, it has little remnants of predecessor. Also it sports a barrage of guest musicians. Most notably guitarist Jeff Beck on a few tracks and Don Henley (Eagles) singing backup on &quot;Watching TV&quot;. <br />As far as the material on this album is concerned, Roger makes a subtle return to the sound of his days in Pink Floyd. Although the full spectrum of those golden days isn't found here, this is a truly touching piece. Without a doubt Roger Waters is one of the greatest lyricist in rock history and his genius is shown in full force here. He brings the social ills of the world to the attention of the listener in this song cycle. In typical Waters fashion a handful of stronger songs hold together a bunch of weaker ones to complete its form. Moments of brilliance include the slowly paced and dark &quot;It's A Miracle&quot;. Personally, I think it's one of Roger's best songs and I still get all shivers down my spine when I listen to it. Other highlights include the two-part &quot;Perfect Sense&quot; and the touching acoustic &quot;Watching TV&quot;. All in all this album is an epic journey somewhat comparable to his earlier works with the Floyd that proves he still can make a fantastic album. Worth a listen, even if you're not a Floyd fan.
B00003CX8J|2.0|I was hoping for something better, after reading and hearing about the movie as much as I did I came away somewhat disappointed.  I guess when we get X-Men 2 thru 10 we can look back and smile.  A great beginning if the series will continue.
B000002U82|5.0|It's just too good!  I've had it for for years, and listen to it all the time, and always, I take something new out of it.  It's so mysterious, like most floyd albums, and if you let your mind wander a bit, you'll come up with things you never dreamed of floating around your imagination.<br />Another thing that I want to bring to light is the DARK SIDE OF OZ thing.  It has been denied by the band, but if you play the album simultaneously with &quot;THE WIZARD OF OZ&quot;, and mute the sound from the movie, the album will coincide perfectly with what's going on in the movie.  I'm not talking about a few small coincidences, I mean that the album was created to be played alongside the movie.  Lyrics, sound effects, the people talking in the background, and the ups and downs of the music itself all work perfectly. <br />You need to start the CD at the third roar of the lion in the MGM Studios lion thing, and just let it play.  Pay attention at the end of the album though to restart the CD THE SECOND IT FINISHES, as the second time is by far the best part of the whole deal (yes it does work a second and third time).  <br />Some really cool parts are when the movie makes the transition from black and white to colour during the intro to 'Money'; the part during the tornado when 'The Great Gig in the Sky' is playing; when the four of them are walking together for the first time, and skipping to We're Off To See The Wizard, and 'Time' is playing on the CD.  They skip together exactly on the baseline at the beginning of the song.  Also, the heartbeat at the beginning and end of the album coincides with Dorothy listening to the Tin Man's heart when she finds him all rusted up by the side of the path.<br />Anyway, I highly recommend buying this album, and indeed the Wizard of Oz.  You won't regret it for a moment.
0833509454|4.0|One of if not the best pure scary books of all times.  Where do you turn and who do you turn to?  Keeps you on your feet and running to check what is under the bed and in the closet.  Not for the faint at heart.
B000002U82|5.0|I just wrote a review for this, and found after that other reviewers say that you should start it on the 2nd roar of the MGM lion. I have always started it on the 3rd one, and I think thats the one Floyd intended on us using.  The reason being is that the more subtle stuff in the movie/album are only picked up if you use the 3rd roar.  <br />Things like the talking in the background (which coincides with certain character's dialogues) will only be seen if you do it this way.  Also during the opening credits, the music has certain big downbeats which work with the appearance of a new name on the screen, which wouldn't work the same on the 2nd.  <br />Many others I know swear that the 2nd roar is the better one, so I would recommend that you try one and then the other.  On the 2nd one, the entry into the colour world with the start of Money is more exact, but I think it was made so you wait a second before it starts.  <br />I've done it at least 15 times on the 3rd roar, and every time it's evident to me that this is the way it was intended to be heard.  <br />Read more on it in one of my previous reviews that I just did 10 minutes ago, which shouldn't be too much below this one (1-5 reviews down). I have a lot more to say an the subject.
0385493800|3.0|A good read but not as great as some of his earlier work.  Some nice research was put into the book so it was not totally out of tune with what happens in society.
0385335482|5.0|This book was absolutely wonderful. I am so picky when it comes to books, but this is a keeper. After reading Bridget Jones I and II, I have looked for similar types of books....light, funny, contemporary, and preferably British. Those British authors are hilarious and they tell it like it is! Many times I  laughed out loud. I can relate to Becky Bloomwood and her shopping obsession...as well as her schemes to get more money. This was a great book to read after a long, stressful day!!
B00003CXE7|5.0|A very educational movie with stunning effects and a great script allow this movie to be one of the best of the year.  Try watching it with you children (teens and above) so that they can learn about the Roman Empire.
0525457585|5.0|I read this book when I was about 10 years old ( In the german version) Now, being 32 I just ordered it for my Goddaughter. Just reading the other reviews made old memories come back to me: Nights spent with the flashlight under the blanket, being up way past bedtime and not being able to stop reading... I would say that besides Tolkiens &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; this book was one of my favorites fantasie books when I grew up. I would definetely reccomend it to anyone.
B000002BYD|5.0|Pearl Jam just hasn't stopped putting out great albums.  Yield is magnificient from start to finish.  Some call it a comeback.....from what No Code was good, whether you'll admit it or not. Gossard is the king of this album with the 3 best songs; No Way, Do the Evolution (I've got a few speeding tickets with that pure adrenaline rush playing), and All Those Yesterdays (He also wrote In Hiding, but its not worth mentioning). McCready also wrote some great ones like Brain of J,(which really kicks off the record great!!)Faithful, and Given to Fly. Ament also puts in his two cents with Pilate,(good song but what is he talking about??)Low Light, and Push me, Pull me (which is kind of a strange one, but I think very catchy).  Vedder also hit right on with Wishlist, (great content, but can get annoying sometimes)and MFC. This record has no weak links. Yield and Vitalogy stand as PJ's brightest stars!! Also buy some ... they are amazing!!!
B000059LGC|4.0|Well, in the movie Murder on the Orient Express the characters seemed a bit out of focus. Unlike that movie, Death on the nile offers many perspectives, and a good hard core story. Though, I do prefer Christie's books this movie made a visual appeal! For mystery diggers, I reccomend this as a personal, or as a family video.
B00005214X|5.0|Not only does the re-issue sound great, but Harrison has added some extra treats to it as well- a new packaging with a timely ecological message...i prefer the original album artwork, but we have that already on the previous CD release and on those records for those of us that were around in the days of vinyl...also added are 5 bonus tracks, which are really nice...&quot;i live for you&quot; is a true gem, a surprisingly exquisite bonus track, which Harrison has completed with his son...then there is a unplugged versions of &quot;beware od darkness&quot; and &quot;Let it down&quot;...the latter with beautiful finishing touches..the most dismissable is the &quot;what is Life&quot; backing track...the new version of &quot;My sweet Lord&quot; has brought about many mixed feelings, but I like it, but I didn't expect much from the start as it was only a bonus track...the opening sitar , and then some new guitar solos sound great...it's nice to hear Harrison again, and I like how he ends it with applause and a brief comeback...however, I'm sure there are many more unreleased tracks from these sessions...maybe he's saving those for a george harrison anthology one day (let's hope so)...as for the album itself, it would be impossible to comment on all the songs here...my favorites are &quot;Isn't It a Pity&quot;, which is haunting Harrison melody among his best, &quot;Art of Dying&quot; which really rocks along with a great heavy sound, and &quot;run of the Mill&quot;..great melody, great lyrics....but I can say that almost of all the other songs on the album except perhaps &quot;I Dig Love&quot; and the Apple Jam...the other minor complaint is that I wish they would have had the inner sleeves of the the original vinyl with poster and all, but that is a minor complaint...the music sounds great and from the look of things we might have a new Harrison album by the end of the year with more re-issues along with bonus tracks, and for me...it couldn't get any better than that..
B0000062Y2|5.0|Loved the movie when it came out, loved the soundtrack since then, appreciate its influence on the general public (Coca-Cola commercial), love the movie and the music, still.  It's a period piece.  How about those hip-huggers and bell-bottoms and Viet-Nam innuendos?
B000001Y79|4.0|I like No Doubt.  Their music is like different than all the other bands out there.  I think their new CD is better, but I still love this CD.  Gwen Stefani is cool.  They have like a punkish band, but with a girl.  I would certainly buy this CD.
0449002632|4.0|I picked this up at the library book sale in HardBack.  It contains more politics than I personally enjoy, but does seem to be a historical summation of things that happened in/around London since the beginning of time.  Quite interesting if you are interested in tidbits of &quot;current events&quot; over the centuries and a bit of human interest as well.  :)
B00004XQP4|5.0|I love Green Day.  There one of my favorite bands.  This CD is sooooo awesome! Its like punk and rock.  <br />Warning: Great song.  Nice beat and lyrics<br />Blood, Sex and Booze: Ummm...not bad.  Its kind of like a sex song.<br />Church On Sunday: Rad Song<br />Fashion Victim: Not one of my favorites.<br />Castaway: My favorite song.  Rad lyrics and a great beat.<br />Misery: Ummm..I like it, but its kinda too slow for me.<br />Deadbeat Holiday: Ok.<br />Hold On: OK<br />Jackass: Ok<br />Minority: Oooo, good song! Love the video, and the meaning<br />Macy's Day Parade: This song bores me.<br />Well, this a rad CD, and you should get it!
6301016289|5.0|This is one of the few films that truly captures the spirit of greed that was rampant on wall street in the 1980's an absolute must see.  Michel Douglas finest performance in my opinion.  It shows how difficult it was to avoid the tempations of insider trading during Wall Streets most scandolous decade.
0446364495|4.0|I resisted this book for a very long time. (Same with the movie, and there, my resistance has held out.) Based on what I had heard, this book was nothing but an overwrought piece of mush. ...<br />Yes, this book is mushy, but not the overwrought, saccherine kind of mush it has been portrayed to be. Francesca is lonely and bored and understandably so. She was, after all, an Italian native raised to be a literature teacher, ending up a farmer's wife in a place where her talents go unrecognized (more on this later). Certainly, someone with an artistic and sensitive temperament that Robert Kincaid posesses would be attractive to her, and vice versa. And while adultery is not something to be celebrated or considered a virtue, I think both of them handled the situation as well as they could have, once they went down the path of loving each other. I do think Richard comes out as more of an oaf than he probably deserved, though. (Again, more on this coming up.) Understand, this is not Shakespeare, this is not Charles Dickens, or George Orwell, or even Anne Rice. This is a light read, meant to appeal to your heart, rather than your mind. I didn't give this book a high rating because it's one of the best I've ever read, but rather because the book was good reading, and it achieved its desired result. Fair enough.<br />The one disappointment is the way the citizens of Winterset, Iowa, are portrayed. I think Waller was very unforgiving. I spent most of my childhood in Iowa -- albeit in the relatively urban area of Dubuque -- and my dad was born and raised on farms in southwestern Iowa. Waller is right on the surface. These rural farming communities tend to be populated by people who are more concerned about weather conditions, the state of the crops, what's happening in so-and-so's lives, than they are in deep philosophical meanings of life. So what? These are people whose lives depend on the whims of Nature, who often can barely eke out a credible existence in years when droughts or floods or ill-timed frost ruin months of hard work. And, the fact that the people of Winterset, Iowa -- in fiction or in real life -- don't talk about taking time to consider the beauty of their bridges, the awesome colors of a sunset, or whatever, doesn't mean those thoughts are never in their heads. Farming is a hard life, however rewarding it may be, and it takes a stronger person than I am to do it. Waller should have respected that in his narration.ghts or floods or ill-timed frost ruin months of hard work.

B000006TRV|5.0|I won't wast anyone's time, so I'll get right to it--The Wall is simply great--the greatest.  Although, I do suggest checking out the movie, which helps explain the story being told on the CD.
B00004X01U|5.0|As I wait for Grammy time on Wednesday night, I cannot wait to see Madonna perform and possibly win a Grammy. In fact, Madonna is probably the only reason I am watching the show this year, I am glad that she has gotten 3 nominations for the album &quot;Music&quot;, and also &quot;Female Vocalist&quot; and &quot;Record Of The Year&quot;, because it just proves that when Madonna releases music it still is getting noticed, some 17 years down the road, with songs like &quot;Music&quot;, &quot;What It Feels Like For A Girl&quot;, and the wonderfully written and my favorite so far on the album &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot;, it's easy to see that she brings out music that people want to hear. I personally would like for her to win Record Of the Year, because I feel that &quot;Music&quot; her song was one of the best songs of last year, I mean it took her back to #1 after a six year absence from the #1 spot, back in 1994. Back in 1999 when she won Grammys for her work on the magnificent &quot;Ray Of Light&quot;, I was also happy to see her win because finally she was getting noticed for her writting of music and the music itself, an that is how I feel now with her being nominated for &quot;Music&quot;, even if she doesn't get Record of the Year and gets Female Vocalist, I won't be disappointed because Madonna for me cannot disappoint me, because she time and time again come out with something new and it sounds like nothing else out there and this for her is 17 years down the road, so many people say that she isn't the best actress and say that she doesn't deserve a Grammy but how can someone that has influence music so much not deserve anything, as she says in the song &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; don't tell her to stop, I don't think anybody is going to and I don't think she will listen, her album &quot;Music&quot; is just as brillant as &quot;Ray Of Light&quot; and all her albums from way back, the &quot;Music&quot; album is just another reminder that Madonna knows what she is doing, and she should she's been doing it for quite some time now. &quot;Music&quot; should make the people come together and cheer for Madonna not route against her. Madonna will be my favorite artist for a lon time and that will not change for a while, as long as she brings out albums, I will buy them and as long as she keeps bringing out quality material, movies or otherwise I will be a fan. Keep on going Madonna.
B000002LQR|5.0|The Chili Peppers are one of my fave bands and this is my fave of all their albums!  It's pure funk from the get go with Flea's bass being the driving force.  Each song has to be a classic in my opinion.  It's practically all rapping tho but if you like rapping, you'll be at home with this.  I love it.  Buy now!  However, if you are new to the Red Hots, I'd recommend you buying Californication first, that's what I did and it worked for me!  I'm now a big fan!
0792151712|5.0|This is a must see, but once or twice only.  Any more than that, you'll become bored, however, if this is the first time you are seeing it, try to get it on DVD, with its 5.1 DD Soundtrack. The Music is more than half the movie, and only a DVD can do true justice to Titanic.  However, it is watchable on VHS, and is simply amazing.  A Must See.
B000002MTR|5.0|Not as good as Cali but OHM still rocks.  Every song is cool on it.  Flea's still as mindblowing on the bass and Dave Navarro was a good choice while John Frusciante was away.  Another Peppers album, another funk filled 60 mins! Best songs: Aeroplane, My Friends, Coffee Shop, Walkabout, Tearjearker, Falling into Grace, Trancending.  The Peppers rule! Make sure you buy Blood Sugar, Cali and OHM everyone!  3 of the best albums ever!
158234082X|4.0|You'll learn some kitchen slang, a lot of new obscenities, a couple of cooking tips. You've already learned all the restaurant survival tips, like &quot;don't order fish on Monday,&quot; from reading the reviews. <br />The main draw here is Anthony Bourdain his own bad, raunchy self. He is Not A Nice Person. I wouldn't want to be him, or even particularly close to him. I'm not sure I even want to eat his food - maybe I know a little too much about his kitchen for comfort. But: man, he tells a good story. Some parts of the story drag, as the various doomed restaurants of his early career start blending together. That costs him a star in my rating. Otherwise, it's an exciting, morbidly fascinating view into Bourdain's life as a sensualist, and the &quot;dysfunctional family&quot; of his kitchen.<br />I &quot;read&quot; this book as an audiobook from audible.com, which I highly recommend. Bourdain himself does the reading, adding life and dimension to this character study. Also, it gets you past the unfortunate editorial flaws mentioned in a previous review.
B00003003R|5.0|Guns N' Roses live!  If you like GN'R you'll love this.  It has all their best tracks on it with the added bonus of Axl's quips!  Slash never plays a note wrong and they all on top form - so if you are up for some balls out rock with the best band ever [in my opinion] you won't go wrong with this.  Even if you have a passing interest in rock buy this.  Buy buy buy, fellow headbangers!
0140185232|5.0|I discovered Maugham last year reading Of Human Bondage for the first time.  Instantly, I became a fan.  Having finished The Razor's Edge, I am on a quest to read everything I can by this wonderous, insightful and witty author. Maugham himself appears in this book and takes quite an actively passive role with his cast of characters.  The lines between reality and fiction are blurred and I agree with another reviewer when you begin to question what is story and what is memoir.<br />I walked away from this book, for the most part, admiring Larry who deliberately chose to follow a different path than his peers.. a path leading towards spritual enlightenment.  Due to an unfortunate encounter with the loss of a comrade during the War, Larry decides that he needs to find out the meaning of life-- much to the dismay of his betrothed.  Isabel just wants to live the &quot;normal&quot; life that every girl of her station (upperclass) has the opportunity to take advantage of. They choose to go their separate ways and the book follows their choices (as well as others in their circle) over the next couple of decades through the roaring 20's and the Great Depression.  While no character actually seems by the end of the novel to be truly happy (except Larry) each achieves exactly what they set out to achieve.  Maugham points this out in the end, and it is a comment that still leaves me questioning. What amazed me most about this novel was that I could recognize people in my own life as fitting some of the roles depicted in it.  The people we learn of are REAL people...their actions, sufferings, and idiosyncracies are recognizable in ourselves and others.  A morality play of sorts, the Razor's Edge offers a look at how individuals choose to fulfill their time here on Earth.. it is both a comment on society and its mores as well as a discourse on personal freedom and spirituality.
B00000J7JO|5.0|This is where the whole Chili Peppers thing began with me.  When When I heard Scar Tissue on the radio, I new the Red Hots were something special.  I was just blown away by how funky it all was.  Every song on this is, in my opinion, a classic.  With laid back tracks like Road Trippin,' Californication, This Velvet Glove, Scar Tissue and funk laden tunes like Around the World, Get on Top, Purple Stain, you'll find that this is one of the most varied albums out there - I did.  This album is a true classic and if you are after something a little different, get this.  Mind-blowing stuff.
6305546789|5.0|I was married the same year this movie came out, to a large degree because my girlfriend wouldn't let go of me after seeing it!  Seriously, this movie contains all the elements of a  very good horror flick with none of the detractors.  The acting is credible, a believable plot and plenty of screams.  There is no gratuitous violence or gore and the characters stayed in character.  The teens were just like those of the day and so were their parents.  Watch this movie on a Holloween night with all the lights turned out through the surround sound...the musical score alone is worth the price.  It sets the moods perfectly without giving away all the screams.
B000002UV1|4.0|Tops Chili Peppers album this, not up to Blood Sugar in my opinion but still mighty fine.  Every song is really good on this album, you won't go far wrong in buying it.  Funk still ruled the Red Hots roost even in their earlier days with Mothers Milk being a good showcase for Flea's bass playing and Anthony's amazing voice.  It's a mix of rapping and er... non rap but it's not as mainstream as Cali etc.  Basically, if you own all their albums in the 90's get this next.  Great stuff.
B00004YM0D|2.0|Don't get me wrong. This is a fine soundtrack. But ANY 60s  compilation CD would suffice. Given the rich orchestral themes which were played at length throughout the film it is a pitty that a film score wasn't released in addition to the soundtrack with the 60s songs (as was done for For the Love of the Game).
0385335482|5.0|Sophie Kinsella's descriptions of the joys of shopping and the terror of creditors hits the nail on the head.  I must admit that even while I was immensely enjoying Becky's exploits, I was fearful that the author would resort to a &quot;white knight&quot; solution for Becky's tough times.  It pleases me to no end that Ms. Kinsella let Becky solve her own dilemmas head on, without losing the same frenetic and hysterical tone that initially drew me into the book. I can't wait for Ms. Kinsellas next offering!
B00004YA66|5.0|There are really two ways you can watch this movie. You can be very analytical and ask who, what, why, where and how, or you can just sit back and enjoy the movie for what it is - a movie. If you are over-analyzing the movie, you will undoubtedly hate it. Yes, there are many plot holes and flaws in the time sequence concept, but nonetheless, it's an enjoyable movie. It was giving me goosebumps throughout the first 30 minutes... it was great.<br />Audio- very nicely done... I could actually hear the dialogue from the center channel without being drowned out by the sub, which seems to be a problem with some of my other dvds.<br />The extras on the DVD are also well done. There's a &quot;science behind frequency&quot; featurette that's really interesting to watch. If you like the scientific side of things, you'll definitely want to check that part out.
0553275976|5.0|I think that one of the most startling things about this novel is that, for everyone who reads it, there is a different pivotal image, a separate moment in the book which forms an axis for the work.  For me, it's Sherman McCoy's phone conversation with his estranged wife, in which he talks about the days when, as he went off to work, he would turn on the street under the window where she was watching, and give the black power sign.  It meant, to this white son-of-a-lawyer, that he wasn't going to get sucked into Wall Street, that he was only using it; that it wouldn't change him.<br />Fast forward a dozen or so years, and Sherman is 38. He's one of New York's leading Bond salesman, a self-titled Master of the Universe who makes a million dollars a year (and that isn't enough), barely sees his wife, and is cheating with another man's gold-digging spouse.  As a matter of fact, when we first meet Sherman, the only redeeming feature he has is that he does seem to really love his five-year-old daughter.<br />Sherman is not the only disgusting character we find as our story opens.  There's the mistress, Maria, who laughs at her husband from the confines of her sublet rent-controlled love-nest.  The wife is bitchy enough to lose sympathy with the reader despite her husband's philandering.  There's the alcoholic tabloid journalist, who is an expert at getting other people to pick up the tab.  And there's a thinly veiled reference to the Rev. Al Sharpton, just to complete the picture.  When the book opens, the only character with whom the reader can sympathize is Larry, a lawyer who chose to work in the Bronx D.A.'s office because he wants to &quot;make a difference&quot;.<br />And yet, the reader is sucked into the lives of these people.  At first it may only be for a tittlating look at how bad bad people can be, but very soon (Wolfe doesn't tease us long) we stay to find out whether our characters will get caught for the crime they have committed; finally, we stay becausewe have come to admire Sherman McCoy.<br />It is a testament to Tom Wolfe's abilities that by the end of the novel, we have come to completely different views of most of the characters in this novel.  The wife isn't bitchy, she's just dissatisfied with a life that she didn't set out to get.  The mistress isn't harmless, she's a viper.  The reporter will print any lie to increase the drama of the crime he's uncovering; the lawyer will justify anything to catch his &quot;Great White Defendant&quot;.<br />Sherman begins the book by telling us that he is entitled to his penthouse, his sports car, his mistress, his Saville Row suits.  He finishes it standing alone, unable to afford a lawyer and &quot;dressed for jail&quot;.  But he's standing, and once again, he's raising a fist in the air, determined to overcome.

B000002H97|5.0|Even after ten years this album still sounds as great today as their first time I listened to it back in mid 1991.  This is easily Metallica's biggest selling album, nearly 13 million copies have already been sold in the United States alone. <br />Enter Sandman the opening track became an instant hit this side of the water, entering the UK charts at number 5, something unheard of for a rock band at that time.  <br />The songs on this album range from very good to utterly brilliant.  My favourites include The Unforgiven a fantastic mix of ballad and hard rock, Nothing Else Matters, probably Metallicas finest ballad, yes that includes both One and Fade to Black, and Through the Never, the last of Metallica's Thrash/Speed songs.<br />Overall this album is nearly faultless, not as heavy as previous efforts sure, but more crisper than &quot;Justice&quot; and every bit as good as &quot;Ride the Lightning and Master of Puppets&quot;.  <br />Metallica have struggled to get anywhere near this quality on recent offerings &quot;Load and Unload&quot; - although both very good albums in their own right.  If you don't already own this album I really have only one piece of advise buy this, along with Ride the Lightning, Master of Puppets and S &amp; M and then you will know how brilliant Metallica actually sound, although you probably know it already
0553573403|4.0|George R.R. Martin's &quot;Song of Ice and Fire&quot; is similar to Robert Jordan's &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; only in the number of characters, depth of back-story, and shear bulk.  With regard to plot and narrative, they take a totally different tack.<br />Jordan pulls in hundreds of deliberately classical elements, and applies his own distinctive twists and turns, but the result still fits solidly within the expected behavior of standard fantasy.  Rand is the protagonist-hero, the Dark One is the archetypical evil presence, and the obvious outcome is that the boy gets the girl(s) and finally defeats the minions of evil in a final climactic battle.<br />That's not really the way SoIaF is working out.  Where Jordan takes standard elements and then customizes them somewhat, Martin sets up all of the standard characters, roles, and props, and then he kills them.  Gruesomely. This leaves the author with a nicely blank canvas on which to develop his own, utterly unpredictable plotlines, and leaves the reader in a state of numbed shock such that any preconceptions and expectations are forcibly suspended.<br />What Martin then chose to populate his tabula rasa would make a Nazi stormtrooper squirm.  Rape, incest, fratricide, pedophilia, rape, infanticide, cannibalism, vivisection, and more rape are bandied about in SoIaF like &quot;channel&quot; and &quot;ta'veren&quot; are in WOT.  In other words, it's a rare chapter that does NOT contain some combination of these and other colorful activities.<br />Had Martin written the Wheel of Time, by the third book, most of the Emond Fielders would be dead, Egwene would be married to Couladin, and the reader would be surprised to find himself in the uncomfortable position of rooting for Eliada in the fight against Shai'tan.<br />I guess I'm suggesting that it's not really a children's fantasy. Structurally, it made me think of Raymond Feist's extended Riftwar series with a strong &quot;R&quot; rating.  With regard to overall tone, it left a bitter aftertaste reminiscent of Stephen R. Donaldson's Chronicles of Thomas Covenant (which was a great and powerful series, mind you).<br />About halfway through the second book, I decided that if something cheerful didn't happen soon, I was just going to quit reading.  Well, a few interesting things did happen, and I suppose I shall pre-order each new volume as well, just to find out where the heck Martin is going with this plot.  But I'm not sure I'll like the answer.it left a bitter aftertaste reminiscent of Stephen R.

B00004TWZF|4.0|The version of this movie on VHS has been my favorite movie for many years. I was recently given this DVD, and they added on about 30 minutes to the old movie. The parts that were added back in change the meaning of the movie for the worse. Rather than enhancing what was in the VHS version, it's like they added on parts from another movie. It's still a good movie, but I recommend the VHS version.
B00000BKE0|1.0|this is there worst album. all the songs sound like they were rushed through, like they didn't think about the material, they just did it. adrian agreed that they didn't work on songs enough. he was right.jannick gers can't hold a candle to adrian smith.&quot;holy smoke&quot; is a lame attempt to trash evangelists. in 1990 that topic was an old hat. slayer did that 2 years ago with the far superior &quot;read between the lies&quot;, as well as countless other bands.&quot;mother russia&quot; is steve's worst epic ever. it sounds like like they just didn't care anymore. they pulled out of this slump after that.fear of the dark was alot better than this crap. lets hope that maiden don't ever sink this far again
0375501851|5.0|In the first chapter, Zadie Smith writes about a character, Clara Bowden, &quot;She wore her sexuality with an older woman's ease, and not like an awkward purse, never knowing how to hold it, where to hang it, or when to just put it down.&quot;    Because this line seemed familiar to me, I e-mailed it to a friend of mine and asked if I was experiencing some genuine deja vu or if he had read something similar somewhere before.  He responded saying that maybe it's just one of those gems that are so good that you think you've heard it before.  Well, White Teeth is filled with many more gems like this.  It's the best novel that I have read in many years.  And, yes, it's all the more remarkable when you consider that Zadie Smith finished it at 24 years of age.
6303394000|5.0|Soon after its 1979 release, curiosity impelled me to see ALL THAT JAZZ. I say curiosity because anything smacking of a film musical didn't then attract my attention much. Not yet an old dog, and apparently still capable of learning a new trick, I remember being impressed. Recently, I saw it presented on the Big Screen once again as part of a classic film revival. I'm reminded what a truly superb production this is.<br /><br />Roy Scheider, in arguably his greatest role ever, portrays Joe Gideon, a work-obsessed Broadway choreographer and director existing on cancer sticks, booze, sex and uppers. Directed by the preeminent choreographer Bob Fosse, ALL THAT JAZZ was purportedly semi-autobiographical.<br /><br />Joe is struggling to put together a new dance production and, simultaneously, edit a behind-schedule film, all the while juggling the three principal women in his life: ex-wife, current significant other, and teenage daughter. Talk about stress! In periodic visual sidebars, we watch as Joe rationalizes his self-destructive behavior to a glamorous Angel of Death, coquettishly played by Jessica Lange.<br /><br />The film's dance sequences, products of Bob Fosse's brilliance, and sets by Phillip Rosenberg and Tony Walton, are visual extravaganzas not to be missed. (Oscars were awarded for Art Direction and Set Decoration.) Perhaps the cleverest is the solo routine performed by the ex-wife character as she rehearses a number to be performed in Gideon's latest production, all the while debating with him the course of their failed relationship. Positively engaging is the \\"impromptu\\" number performed for Joe at his apartment by his current mistress (played by the strikingly long-legged Ann Reinking), along with his daughter. Then there's the sexually suggestive \\"Air Otica/Come Fly With Us\\" ballet sequence, Gideon's attempt to energize an otherwise stodgy production. (\\"Well, we've lost the family audience.\\")<br /><br />Another nice touch for the uninitiated is the revelation that performer selection and training for a polished dance routine is a hard, sweaty, merciless process. The faint-hearted best not show up for the audition.<br /><br />Perhaps the film's only flaw is its length as it unwinds to its foregone conclusion.

B00005614N|5.0|It is difficult to understate the importance of the meeting of these two seminal figures in the history of Amercan music.  It is as if Picasso and Rembrandt collaborated on a painting.  The result is as good as you might expect, with Armstrong and his all-stars coming up with original and compelling arrangements of some of the Duke's great masterpieces, the Duke contributing mightily from the keyboard, and Louis in as fine a voice as he has ever been heard.  Fine sound quality too.  Even if you are not a jazz afficianado, this is one CD worth owning as a historical document.
1558908358|4.0|This movie is classic. The concept was pretty strange, it ain't exactly going to win any &quot;realism&quot; awards... but it was an awesome flick. <br />Everything is done as kind of an electronic world, that looks like a black and neon wonderland. The special effects for the time were pretty impressive, and the light-cycles thing is still cool to watch. <br />The test of time has killed off a lot of it's credibilty (as we all pretty much know their aren't little, electric people inside our computers, waiting for us to tell them what to do), but it was kind of an interesting concept.<br />In it's own way, it hinted about the dangers of thinking computers (A.I.), before movies like &quot;The Terminator&quot; and &quot;The Matrix&quot;.<br />it had several small computer references that are kind of fun to sort out...<br />stuff like Tron (a command in BASIC), RAM (Random Access Memory), Bits, De-rez (which sounds and acts a lot like &quot;defrag&quot;), users, and all a bunch of other small &quot;nerd-terms&quot; for those who follow computer-ese.<br />Fun movie, but you might keep in mind it's gettin' old!
6304806426|3.0|Let's not even get into the &quot;Fargo&quot; vs &quot;English Patient&quot; arguement.  Yeah this movie has flaws...lots of them in fact, but at least it's trying!  While Fargo was a thoroughly nauseating bore, the English Patient was merely an under-realized story with lots of lush cinematography,and some technically masterful direction.   I am a big fan of Minghella!  He is one of the few directors out there that genuinely tries to hit one out of the park each time at bat.  As with all directors however; he could not overcome the essential thinness of his material . In the end there is too large a discrepancy between what the  movie should have been and what it is.  P.T. Anderson &quot;almost&quot; sold me on the plight of his miserable characters in Magnolia (despite also having a weak narrative); a feat Minghella ultimately could not pull off with the &quot;English Patient&quot;.
B000059XUI|4.0|Superman is back in this first (and only quality) sequel to the one that started it all. The man of steel is up against 3 villains from his home world who have been trapped in the &quot;phantom zone&quot;, and all heck breaks loose here on Earth! This movie is packed with great special effects, and one of my most favorite scenes ever in a movie....when the villain Ursul cries out &quot;Superman&quot; and proceeds to throw a bus full of people at him. Great camp, a great cast and a true successor to the original. Buy Superman and Superman II, but don't waste your money on the other 3!
B0000203YT|2.0|Everyone must love the word play, the costumes, the energy, the sets, the feel of this movie.  It is fine entertainment.  The actors are all having a great deal of fun.<br />But it's like watching cotton candy.  It's all sugar and spice, but no substance.  In particular, there is no sense at all that this is a film about *Shakespeare*.  A film about his plays, yes.  But this Shakespeare does not remotely approach the genius we see in the plays.  And that's too bad, really, because any film that could capture *that* would be a film worth watching again and again.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I loved, loved, loved this CD! It's by far the best CD I own, and also the best CD ever. All the Beatles songs that are on this CD are great, and they never get boring. You can listen to this CD over and over because it has 27 tracks, that it never gets old. My favorite song on this CD is &quot;Love Me Do&quot; because I love how they say love me do! It's too cute. :) Sure, if you were a diehard Beatles fan, then this collection might seem &quot;unextrodinary&quot; but to the casual listener, or small fan, this is a great CD! I mean, 27 whole songs on 1 CD? Where can you go wrong? This CD has so many songs packed into it, that it's amazing! &quot;Yesterday&quot; is sad, &quot;Hey Jude&quot; is cool, &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; is funky, &quot;Come Together&quot; is modern, &quot;Lady Madonna&quot; is great, and &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; is a classic. You would have to buy a ton of Beatles CDs just to get all these great songs. You will not be disappointed. Buy this CD!! :)
0393312836|5.0|this book is a celebration of language.  the creativity of slang and youth combine to challenge the reader to decipher and diagram every sentence.  once some repitition has been established, new words are introduced and the adventure continues.  the storyline revolves around violence, both physical and mental.  the 21st chapter of the book is not included in some editions so this is the one to buy.
B00000J2KV|5.0|That particular sly ad campain line heraladed the  summer 62 release of, Kubricks film vision  of author  Nabakovs, tart  writers exercise in memory.The public, teased into  theaters, hoping nudity, and or foul language were to be presented, left befudled. Large lobby posters of a sunglassed Sue Lyons sucking  a heart shaped lollypop didnt untangle this coded classic.The film; full of elegant framing, and brimming with witty, urbane language and action, not only retains its sublime seductiveness, but positively glows in its DVD form. The stark, pristine black and white image,transfered from what appears to be orginal master stock is a delight;  as much a delight as its original &quot;lollypop&quot;promise. The intimacy of the new technology, welds itself to the intimacy of Humbert Humbert's diary, allowing the viewer to enter this made up &quot;writer/filmakers collaborative world , and enjoy this meditative piece,about the impossibility ,though never escapable attempt ,to control an intrusive outside world through  creative invention.
B0000524E5|5.0|Coyote Ugly is a fantastic movie that not only incorporates that typical... guy finds girl, loses girl, gets girl back... chick flick storyline, but also a whole lot of fun and excitement.  It was in my opinion, one of the cutest and funnest movies of 2000.  Piper (Violet-leading actress) played the right role for the part.  She has an innocent face that's hard not to fall in love with.  As for the leading actor, he too shines in his part, with his down to earth personality that depicts the hard-working population of society.  I highly recommend this movie, not only for the so called, &quot;hot babes,&quot; (as many males would describe it) but for the countless breathtaking moments of desire for sweet love.  If you're a romantic, you'll surely LOVE this movie, because I know I did.  Leann Rimes really fit in great in the picture also.  Her songs worked magic upon the atmosphere of the movie.  I even have the soundtrack!  Anyhow, I hope all of you watch this movie because I'm sure both guys and girls will enjoy it, and maybe you'll appreciate your significant other afterwards... or strive to reach your career.
0440234743|3.0|I had never read a Grisham novel before this one. I absolutely loved the legal maneuvering involved -- especially Nate's tearing the greedy wannabe-heirs' testimony apart in the depositions. On the other hand, I'm surprised I got through the monotonous and contrived religious conversion of the main character, as much as I was rolling my eyes.<br />The bottom line is that I found The Testament entertaining enough to want to sample other Grisham works; if, however, the preachiness and prayerfulness become a thread throughout his work, I'll probably never be a fan.
B00003XB8K|5.0|I really enjoyed this CD.  My favoite song is #5.  I am a teenager is college.  When things get really hair as they sometimes do, I listen to that song and it gives me strength to go on.  I also like the very first part.  It has finally changed from an orchestra warming up to something totally different.  I was starting to get sick of the orchestra thing.  I also like the way he expresses himself.  He has turned his art into something totally different.  He is exploring new ideas and new ways of producing music.  I really like that.  I like it when an artist does something that he wouldn't normally do.  If you like music that makes you think, relax or just music that is good to listen to, this is your CD.

6305128952|5.0|An extremely moving blend of visual imagery and a compelling story of strength, love and realizations, &quot;The Horse Whisperer&quot; brings to life one of the bext novels ever written, while also giving the audience a movie that sets a new standard for emotion and feeling. It's a film that makes us laugh and a cry, a movie that depresses us as well as gives us an uplifting sense of wonder and awe. This has got to be one of the best movies ever made. <br />When her daughter Grace is critically injured while riding her horse, her business-oriented parents go through the painful decision of having her legs removed, which comes as a shock to Grace when she awakens from her coma. What's more, the horse is left with severe physical and emotional scars, none of which anyone can or knows how to heal. Even as the horse becomes increasingly distant and violent when approached by a human, Grace's mother, Annie, refuses to allow the animal to be put down, and begins researching methods and techniques of horse recuperation. When she comes across a magazine article about &quot;horse whisperers,&quot; she makes a call to the man interviewed in the article, Tom Booker, who is unable to help her. <br />While shown in theaters, up until this moment of the movie, the film is shown in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio, which is to reflect the cramped, noisy lifestyle that Annie lives in. Determined to find a cure for her daughter's horse as well as to mend their dwindling relationship, she packs the horse and her crippled daughter into their car and takes them on a road trip to Montana, where the film then takes on the aspect ratio of 2.35:1, allowing us to enjoy the full splendor of the surrounding hills and mountains. When they reach their destination, Tom agrees to help her so long as Grace is willing to offer her help. Willing the horse back to its normal attitude proves to be no easy task, though Tom has extreme patience in dealing with the animal. As the progress begins to grow, so does the bond between Annie and Tom, as well as the relationship between mother and daughter. But will Annie's and Tom's differences keep them apart? And what about her husband, who is waiting for results back in the city? <br />The movie takes its time in exploring its plot, giving us nothing but meticulous detail in every nuance of the story. There is never a moment throughout the movie when we do not know what kind of feelings each character is going through, nor are we left in the dark when something intrical to the advancement of the plot occurs. While it may look as simple as the country life it portrays, the story is utterly complex and moving, finely tuned with emotion and themes of love, sadness, and natural beauty. <br />The extensive visual imagery and settings are so gorgeous and so large that some of the shots almost swallow the characters. The beauty of the mountain ranges and low-lying valleys of Montana and the Midwest are so satisfying that they alone are worth going to see the movie if for nothing else. They also act as a symbolization of the characters' feelings, because throughout the movie, most of the characters at some time feel lost and confused, which is underlined by the vast amounts of open space that surrounds them all. I don't think there has ever been a film so far that has been able to give us such a wondrous canvas of natural beauty like this one has done. <br />Character development is done with such terrific clarity that I was able to identify emotionally with different characters on different levels. Tom Booker is played superbly by Robert Redford, and is the embodiment of the simplistic, easy-going rancher who is not satisfied with material possessions, but more with the joy he gets from his family and his work. Annie is played by Kristin Scott Thomas, who delivers a powerful and complex performance in making us believe in her struggles with her daughter and the horse. The love story angle that Annie and Tom share is a moving and brilliant emotional display, and what is even better about it is that it does not become so overly-engrossing that is consumes the main focus of the story, which is the horse's recovery. <br />As &quot;The Horse Whisperer&quot; unfolds, you'll find yourself moved by every waking minute of its complex plot and involving characters. The core of this movie is nothing but heart, and lots of it, which is enough for a tear-jerker as well as a truly uplifting experience.
B000002UA0|5.0|I don't know why people think the wall is such an excellent album compared to what Floyd did before it.  In terms of progression Floyd peaked with this album.  The more I listen to it the more I like it.  Syd was an excellent songwriter and I love the short poppy songs best.  Another thing I love about Syd was his guitar playing.  His playing was unique yes but most importantly to me he wasn't trying to cop american blues like so so so many others in England.  Syd just played his own style which to me shows more depth and talent than others trying to recreate something they admire themselves.  Opinions vary but I know my music and this is the best floyd album without question.  Am I the only one who finds Floyds late 70's output bloated and boring oh yea and oh so depressing/insipid. (animals and the wall)??
B00003CWTI|5.0|I was surprised at the lack of appreciation this movie got, and was actually talked out of seeing it. This movie was quite a surprise, and it scared me on a lot of levels. There were so many hidden ironies that watching it multiple times is almost a must. Contrary to what other people have said, Anderson did a fine job of balancing the multitude of actors, and throughout the whole movie- through every scene that, in any other movie, would come off as funny - these scenes were tense. And after going through the entire 3 hours of the movie, the last 5 minutes dont seem nearly as awkward as everyone describes. Fantastic movie.

Helen Fielding is brilliant. The sequel is even better. I was busting at the seams during both books.
6305358613|4.0|&quot;Elizabeth&quot; is like a dream that will steal your heart away for the duration of its story, and once it is handed back to you, you'll find yourself in utter awe of the events that have taken place before your eyes. It pours on many different elements, those of emotion, intelligence, slight suspense, romance, betrayal, and historical events, all of which combine on a canvas that takes us into the life of a woman who stands out as one of the most successful monarchs in world history. But more importantly, we become so wrapped up in the movie's gossamer feel that we forget everything else and just enjoy it for what it is: pure beauty. <br />As the movie begins, King Henry VIII of England is dead, and his daughter Mary Tudor assumes the throne as queen of England. At this time in society, there are two sides to religion: the Catholics, who are comprised of the monarchy and the citizens considered loyal to the throne, and the Protestants, who are seen as heretics. Mary's half sister, Elizabeth, is of the Protestant faith, so after her father's death, there is fear in the royal court that the Protestants will try to raise her to the throne. Before Mary is able to send Elizabeth to her death, she herself miscarries a child and soon dies of a tumor, leaving the throne, as well as the turmoiled country, to her sister. She is christened queen, only to discover that her country is in shambles, and that her personal relationship with Lord Robert Dudley is looked down upon by the court. As the plots of overthrowing her position of power begin to thicken, Elizabeth is aided by the help of Sir Francis Walsingham in finding out her true adversaries as well as finding the will to lead her country. <br />There are so many positive aspects that the movie has going for it; it takes all of this in stride, however, never thinking too highly of itself, which can lead to failure. The story itself is the most intrical of these aspects, handling the history and events in a straighforward and very effective manner. As soon as we are introduced to the character of Elizabeth, we become entranced by her physical beauty as well as her willingness to do what is right by her country. For the most part, the history involved in the movie is accurate, and while their do remain some minor elements of historical liscense, in the end, it does not have as great an effect as the rest of the movie will. <br />The settings for the movie are absolutely gorgeous, some of the most elaborate ever used in a film. Perhaps this is because they are the real thing, filmed on location in numerous castles throughout England and Scotland, as well as becoming the first film ever to obtain permission to carry out production at the historical York Minster. The intricate sets, combined with the abundant use of dark imagery, all work together in creating the dismal and unforseen atmosphere that is Elizabeth's world. The light and dark imagery is also a key factor, for as the film progresses, there is an obvious transition from the darkness of England to the lighter days of Elizabeth's less-heinous rule than that of earlier monarchs. <br />The aspect of Elizabeth's personal life is a truly magnificent in the way it shifts when she becomes queen. The movie handles this transition greatly, giving actress Cate Blanchett so many avenues to travel down as Elizabeth begins to realize that once she is queen, her personal life will become public and accessible everyone around her. This has a great effect on the romance between Elizabeth and Lord Robert Dudley, whom she loves more than anything in the world. She soon realizes, though, that the love she holds for him is of a higher caliber than that which she holds for England, and her decisions begin to focus more on her concerns for her country's welfare. <br />The music for &quot;Elizabeth&quot; is quite striking, possessing that same gothic/light feel that shifts with the intended mood of each scene. David Hirschfelder, through his powerful use of vocals as well as strings and ensembles, is able to bring to life the many feels of the movie, from the intense and beautiful romance of the two main characters to the patriotic and wartorn England. I found myself most partial to the music of the royal festivities, especially that of the night in which the boats ride the water, where the music could easily be playing from the shore by the queen's royal court. <br />There is a high momentum of star power employed here, bringing diversity and grandeur to the film. Cate Blanchett received a Golden Globe award for her portrayal of Elizabeth, giving the title character fire and passion, wit and sincerity. She plays out all of the queen's ambitions and hopes for her reign with true believability, and by film's end, we are left with a stunning portrayal of the monarch. Geoffrey Rush portrays the sinister though well-meaning Walsingham, whose loyalty to his queen is makes for one of the most excellent performances from Rush since &quot;Shine.&quot; Joseph Fiennes, playing the part of Dudley, is superb as the confused lord who cannot decide what to do about his love for the queen. Richard Attenborough seems the only person fit to play Sir William Cecil, attending to his queen's wishes for her country's rule. And Christopher Eccleston plays the enemy, the Duke of Norfolk, with pomp and piety. <br />There is a lot at work in &quot;Elizabeth,&quot; making it one of the best movies of 1998. We are able to feel sympathy for the historic queen, not only because of the implications of her personal life, but also for the many responsibilities with which she is left to attend to. You'll find yourself moved by the movie's story as well as the character development and interaction, all making the movie rich, deep, and warm as pulsing blood.
6303422020|2.0|While it has its moments, this sequal doesn't even compare to the first one. The cartoons between the stories are embarrassingly lame, and the Indian story is awful. The Raft is pretty creepy, and I think the hitchhiker story is the only one that comes close to anything from the original.
0385493622|4.0|Who would have thought you can enjoy a book about math?  I am a math major, but I still didn't want to read a book that is more like a textbook with some interesting bits squeezed in about Fermat's theorem.  Fortunately I got what I wanted in reading a STORY in the context of a math problem.  The story is real and the people are real and Singh did a great job of capturing the essence of the story and its participants.<br />This mainly reads like a history book for the first half and then becomes a detailed news report in the second half flush with quotes and happenings.  To read about Andrew Wiles' saga is incredible and how long it took him to go through with this.<br />I might be saying this from a non-math enthusiast perspective, but I wanted a little more commentary on what all this means.  How about the fact that most likely Wiles did not use the same tools to solve Fermat's Thm as Fermat himself?  Maybe Fermat didn't solve the theorem?  I always say in my math book in the margins of the page &quot;Oh I have a ingenious proof of this theorem, but I don't feel like writing it now&quot;.  How about the real-world and mathematical impact of this theorem and its proof?<br />It's a fun historical read and the math you need to know for this book is elemental college-level, but don't expect much more than this.
B00003CXFV|3.0|I wasn't expecting alot from this movie, even though it is nominated for Best Picture. I was pleasently suprised. When I rent movies, I tend to watch them while I am doing something else. This movie held my attention the whole time. Of course, I do enjoy real-life dramas. I found this one to be very well done. Stephen Soderbergh is amazing. I found Out of Sight and Traffic to be better, but I was really impressed with this movie. I'll admit Julia Roberts was good, but not great. I prefer actors who make me forget the actor and believe in the character they are playing. I couldn't forget that it was Julia Roberts. So, she played somewhat out of character. But, all she really did was show some skin and swear. Yes, she was good, but Oscar worthy? I don't think so.<br />Good movie and I would definitely recommend it to friends.
B00003CX5A|5.0|When and if I go mad I can only hope the things dancing in front of my unblinking eyes resemble characters from Tim Burton movies. As surreal and nightmarish as 'Batman' and 'Edward Scissorhands' were, they can't hold a candle to 'Sleepy Hollow&quot;. The whole film oozes atmosphere. And the effects are simply amazing. There were times in 'Sleepy Hollow' that made my jaw drop. From the first decapitation to the first appearence of the Headless Horseman, emerging at full gallup from the heart of the Tree of the Dead, I was stunned. The storyline should be familiar to everyone, the only real difference is the change of Ichabod's occupation. No longer a school teacher he is now a Constable, sent to the remote town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate the rash of beheadings that plague the small town. Johnny Depp's portrayal of Ichabod is great, playing him as a frightened little girl trapped inside a man's body. Ichabod is also haunted by nightmares of his childhood which we experience through beautiful flashbacks. Once set upon the case he meets Katrina Van Tassel, played by the impossibly beautiful Christina Ricci, and a whole town of squabbling politicans and doctors. The supporting cast is pure vintage goods, featuring fine performances by Michael Gambon, Jeffery Jones, Miranda Richardson, Christopher Lee, Michael Gough, and Ian McDiarmand - some of which are old veterans of British horror, all of which are great. Given what little screen time these actors are given, it's testimony to their performances that we feel very comfortable with them and actually like them, no matter what dark secrets they might be harboring. The violence in the film is graphic, to say the least, but nonetheless very comic-booky. The blood looks like poster paint and every decapitation and impaling is so deftly shot that one doesn't have time to really dwell on the image, just enough time to be shocked. The film isn't very terrifying, not in the Friday The 13th sense of the word, anyway. What Tim Burton has done here instead is make a perfect fable, a bedtime story told extremely well by a man who has an uncanny knack for creating whole living, breathing worlds whose inhabitants and scenery are not only unforgettable but also wholey original. Burton's best film so far. Note to readers: see this film on DVD. VHS format simply doesn't contain enough clarity to fully appreciate the amazing set pieces and stunning special effects.
B000058983|5.0|Love's Forever Changes is simply one of the best albums of all time.  Standing up better than most psychedelic masterpieces, this is dizzy trip, incorporating pop and rock, loud guitar and orchestra.  This version offers a remastered sound and extra tracks.
0679735909|5.0|Having just finished reading &quot;Possession&quot; by A S Byatt (which I couldn't put down) I consulted my  Oxford Companion to English Literature to find out more about R H Ash and Christabel LaMotte.  I was so convinced that they actually existed.  I am filled with admiration for the author.  I was utterly taken in by her novel which I was convinced was semi-biographical.  I thought the letters and poems were the genuine article.  I don't want to give the impression that this is a 'heavy' text.  I admit I did skip some of the poems to go back and read later because I just had to find out how things turned out in the end.  The best book I have read in a long time.
0679892478|5.0|This book is a tour de force for helping with reading and counting to ten, using a vocabulary of only 75 words!  A lion, dog, and tiger find many interesting ways to balance ten apples vertically on their heads, building up from only one.  Then the birds decide they would like the apples, and the fun really begins.  The conclusion will leave your child giggling happily.<br />Most simple books try to teach only counting or reading.  I found it to be a great idea to combine the two.  It makes the task both easier and more interesting for your child.<br />By using only 75 words, there is much repetition to help your youngster identify words that she or he will reuse throughout life.  Here is an example:<br />\\"One apple up on top!<br />Two apples up on top!\\"<br />The illustrations nicely cue the young person to the words and the numbers involved.  With these words I have quoted, you see the lion with the requisite number of apples balanced on top of the head.<br />The illustrations are also very active, and help draw interest to the story.  Mr. Roy McKie's colorful, dynamic  illustrations bring the story to life.  Otherwise, how interesting can a counting book be?<br />Most children will have no trouble memorizing this story.  Then, they can \\"read\\" along as you read aloud.  Later, you can stop for certain words that they know how to identify, and they can read that word as part of the sentence you are reading aloud.  You can also encourage them to count the number of apples aloud on each creature's head.<br />You can extend the value of this book by adding some pages of your own that involve numbers beyond ten.  Your child will enjoy helping your with the illustrations for those pages.  With the simple text structure, you cannot help but match what Dr. Seuss would have written (writing here under his pen name of Theo. Le Sieg -- the reverse of his real last name).<br />As an adult, I also encourage you to consider creating other books for your children to learn from.  You could take this same structure, and introduce other nouns as well.  Beyond that, you could also use this structure (with tiny amendments) to teach new verbs.  By adding only a few dozen words, you can greatly expand your child's ability to enjoy stories!<br />Keep it simple, and everything can be understood!rom.

6300183971|4.0|I appreciated the angle this version played, granted, the cinimatagraphy isnt the greatest. Its clean for the most part, a little shady at times, but on the whole a great slant on the book. I would recommend seeing before you buy. MOst video stores have both the 1984 and the 2000 version, rent and watch both. Also, reading the book is extremely helpful, the 2000 version doesnt explain much although it does stick closer to the book then the 1984. A word of caution about the 2000: Pink is an evil color. At times this movie is a little risque.

B0000041Z5|5.0|As with most of my reviews, I must comment on the sound.  London/Decca has nearly perfected how to make great sounding recordings.  These discs, recorded in the late 70s are a great demonstration of the &quot;Decca Sound&quot; which I am such an adamant fan of.  For a recording to be great, it has to start off with adequate sound to detail the music.  Here the recorded sound is excellent--has good presence, full detail from highs to lows, and spacious.<br />Two factors go into my rating of 5 stars.  First, the price.  Seeing that this is an affordable box set, it instantly becomes favorable.  Full price box sets of 4 discs are around $60.  The favorable price of the set coupled with the performances make this box set attractive enough to rate it 5 stars.  Solti turns in some great performance of Brahms' symphonies.  Solti favors a full orchestra with thicker textures rather the lighter and thinner orchestras of say a Mackerras recording.  I enjoy the full orchestra with a beefier string section.  The tempos of the symphonies are well within range of most other recordings.  There aren't really any big surprises in these recordings, which can often make them not stand out in a crowded bin of Brahms recordings.  However, that doesn't mean they are bad performances.  Now, if one was to buy individual recordings of each symphony, there are performances which truly stand out, but this set has to be seen as a collective and overall this set is great.  Whether you're a fan of the symphonies of Brahms, or the conducting style of George Solti, you'll find that these are fine recordings with enough flair to keep you interested.  One note for comparison, all 4 Brahms symphonies are available on 2 discs recorded by Herbert von Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic.  They are cheaper and a little bit more spirted than this box set if you're all about price.
B00004T1NA|5.0|Atypicly personal, &quot;Lightbulb Sun&quot; shows a leap of maturity in a  band that's yet to &quot;bust wide open&quot;. There's some gloomy stuff here. &quot;Feel so Low&quot; &quot;Hatesong&quot; and the 13+ minute &quot;Russia on Ice&quot; are emotionally devestateing, albeit brilliant, expressions of anger, loss, self-destruction and abandonment. Yet there's focus on the &quot;other&quot; a well.  The title track is an exquisite lament about a child forced to view the world in a bedridden hell. &quot;Last Chance to Evacuate Earth Before it is Recycled&quot; is a deceptively brillaint little observation of the infamous &quot;Heaven's Gate&quot; cult. &quot;How is Your Life Today&quot;, both creepy and oddly funny, has a vague &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; banality to it. Fans of earlier &quot;Tree&quot; albums might think they're selling out with this, but I'm eager to see what they come up with next.  It's Infinately more interesting and creative than 98% of the barnyard waste that wins grammys.
B000056VIY|5.0|im sorry i have to disagree with alot of these j~lo bashing reviews. it seems like no matter how hard she tries, people always have to hate on her.her lates cd is great, with great catchy lyrics, and a more improved voice, and the people that hate on her are the people that cant be her.!!!!!
B00003CX9Q|5.0|In 1982, I had the privaledge of watching &quot;E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial&quot; as a wide-eyed, innocent, and very imaginative eight-year-old boy.  Little did I know then that that evening's excursion to the cinema would change my life. Henry Thomas gives us the 'everychild' with yearning, lonliness, innocence, kindness, charm, and wit.  His performance ranks as one of the best child performances I have yet seen.  The ending is one of the most emotionally satisfying experiences in film - sentimental or not, it delivers 100%.  John Williams' score is simply dazzling and unforgettable.  I've seen the film more times than I can count-it's a comfortable place to go to from time to time.  The film offers an escape from the adult cynic resting in my grey matter. Getting swept up in the warm embrace of &quot;E.T.&quot; makes me feel kind of like a kid again - it's a familiar journey that I never grow tired of.<br />I must mention the laughable tragedy that was the 1982 Acadamy Awards.  The safe, 'prestige' picture &quot;...quot; won the Best Picture trophy over &quot;E.T.&quot;  I have read from many sources (critics, fans, and otherwise) who have voiced dissatisfaction with this.  I, for one, am glad it happened.  Yes, &quot;...quot; will be forgotten (does anybody really talk about it?) and it was basically a flat historical bioepic.  ....   It's recently been reported that Spielberg plans on reissuing &quot;E.T.&quot; with remastered sound and &lt;gulp&gt; effects sometime in 2002.  Will he give it the &quot;...&quot; treatment (Special Edition of '97), or will he just &quot;clean&quot; it up without changing any shots?  We'll have to wait and see.  Don't expect a DVD anytime soon because of this reason. I'll just watch my beloved widescreen VHS until then.
B00000IB8M|5.0|This cake album is the bets i've heard.  Although their previous works have been very strong, nothing can match the usually mellow and always odd musical and lyric abilities of these boys.  This tape once got stuck in my tape deck for 4 months.  It was possibly the best thing that has ever happened to me.  If you're a fan of music, you need to own this album.  Nothing can match the mellowness of mexico, or the irony of satan is my motor. Cool blue reason is another strong track although somber in lyrics and tone.  But basically, every track is amazing.  The best album ever, without a doubt.
0679879269|5.0|As entertainment, this set of novels is beyond comparison!  (I haven't read Harry Potter...so maybe I'll find something to compare in those if I ever read them...)<br />Here is one great story!  Full of adventure -- nothing short of classical mythology can touch it.<br />And, this book exceeds any expectations the first two novels may have created for the reader.   But these are more than entertaining books.  Mr. Pullman explores a view of formal religion that many would consider heretical.  Yet he should be given a chance to speak without being shouted down.  In proposing a view in which every creature works to make life better for others -- and concentrates on the present issues of existence rather than looking forward to a Heaven beyond one's own world, Mr. Pullman shares something that is more deeply moral and life-affirming than many would believe.<br />Indeed, his view is more truly &quot;Christian&quot; than much which purports to be so.<br />I began my review of the first book in this series by saying that I had given up hope of ever reading anything which inspired a deep sense of wonder in my mind.  And that I looked forward to seeing if the other two novels would be as wonderful.<br />Now, I can say, YES!  These books are amazing!<br />The only thing which would be more wonderful would be to learn what else happens after the conclusion of this trilogy.<br />Perhaps, Mr. Pullman will give us those books one day!
B000002KDG|5.0|I contend that &quot;Comes a Time&quot; from 1978 and &quot;Rust Never Sleeps&quot; from 1979 are one of the best back to back recordings by any rock artist, period! They do everything that rock music was meant to: they make a comment or tell a story, they offer variety in direction and flavor, they create a mood, and they define a period in time, just to name a few of these CDs' qualities. Where &quot;Comes a Time&quot; was more laid back just like the latter mid 70s themselves, &quot;Rust Never Sleeps&quot; keeps one foot on those roots but displays an attitude and relentlessness that accompanied the late 70s/early 80s, not to mention a grungeful flavor of what was too come a bit further down the road. It was Neil at his most playful and most reflective in quite some time. And it was probably Neil's toughest act to follow, as &quot;Reactor&quot; would soon attest. Acoustical gems are &quot;Thrasher&quot; and &quot;Pocohantas&quot;, both showing a hunger for simpler times, drawing strong parallels with times past and soon to come. &quot;Sail Away&quot; is a melodic jewel, shining in so many aspects - the perfect compelmenting of acoustic guitar and harmonica, the gorgeous harmonies in the background. &quot;My,my, Hey, hey&quot; works both acoustically and electrically - another influence Young had on MTV, as their future &quot;unplugged&quot; sessions demonstrated. And &quot;Powderfinger&quot; still gives me goosebumps when I listen to it. It's a beautifully written song and performed to perfection. This is one of those solid listens from start to finish. Only Neil seems capable of delivering one extreme to the other and pulling it off so unpretentiously. That's always been the allure of Neil. This period was the zenith for most Neil Young fans. His songs were still from a time and place much different from today, yet had the foresight of what was too come and dealt with it. This CD is second only to &quot;Comes A Time&quot; on my fave Neil CDs list, if only for what I consider &quot;C.A.T.'s&quot; elegence. But scoring a three-peat would prove more difficult, and the more Neil tried after this CD, the more distant his long time fans became. It was fun while it lasted, as this would be Neil's last great recording, at least for quite some time.
B000021XS0|5.0|I purchased this CD a little over a year ago, and was immediately blown away.  This is Dream Theater's finest work because it achieves a perfect balance between virtuosity and melody, fast hard pieces with softer, quieter movements, and a very mature and precise overall sound.  Moreover, singer James LaBrie is in excellent form; his range isn't what it used to be, but instead of straining he sings within his still fantastic capacities.  The end result is excellent vocals that blend well with the amazing instrumental music.  I must have listened to SFAM nearly a thousand times over the past year, and it truly never gets old.  One of the greatest rock CDs ever.  Buy it, and play it to a few friends...this band deserves to be better known than it is.
B00004XONN|5.0|I just picked up kid a and i am already hooked. Really like kid a, in limbo, and idioteque.  I put it up there with my all time favorite album &quot;mezzanine&quot; by massive attack.
0553260111|5.0|I am currently going thru my 3rd copy of &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot;, having reread this book so often.  Probably my favorite all time book.  If you saw the television mini-series, FORGET IT AND BUY THE BOOK.  This one is full of action, twists, romance, you name it this one has it.
0790743213|4.0|this film is directed by Alfred Hitchcock. the story is about the adventures of Roger Thornhill who is suspected of a murder that he didn't commit. he tries to escape from the police and spies continuously. this movie reminds me of an old 007 movie. there include some violent and romantic scenes... however, the scenes in this film are quite different from ones in today's movies.
0553288105|5.0|I love the Asimov robot novels and also the Foundation series. What Asimov lacks in character development, he makes up for in excellent plots with good surprises throughout. \\"The Gods Themselves\\" is an interesting book--it's later Asimov and it's not a robot novel nor a Foundation novel. It deals with a major discovery, the \\"electron pump\\" which looks to be a source of unlimited, free energy, and two groups of scientists in parallel universes who each have an agenda that threatens to obscure a dangerous truth.<br /><br />In this novel, Asimov creates a totally believable alien race, complete with three sexes (and he deftly handles their mating or lovemaking with amazing sensitivity and creativity.) A bridge between the alien universe and ours offers something for each side, seemingly for free, but scientists on both sides begin to sense that something is evilly wrong. How the wrong is righted is quite surprising and touching. The alien adolescents Odeen, Dua and Tritt are fascinating together. Dua shines as a conflicted, troubled and unusually intelligent person who turns out to be quite the heroine. (Incidentally the names are sorta-kinda \\"one\\", \\"two\\" and \\"three\\" in Russian)<br /><br />The third part of the novel is the weakest (where the people on the Moon figure out what's happening with the Proton Pump.) It has the worst of Asimov's attempts to write romance. And the first section can be a bit slow unless you have worked in academia, in which case, his characterization of professors and their internal wars is spot-on (you wonder, what was life like when Asimov was a professor at Boston University. Probably pretty acrimonious at some point.)<br /><br />I rate this one of my favorite novels of Asimov, along with The Caves of Steel and The Naked Sun--leaving aside the Foundation books, which stand on their own as an achievement in a series form. Asimov deftly creates alternative worlds, and if his characters are sometimes a bit wooden, it's overshadowed by his amazing imagination. This novel may actually be his best, if not his most creative.  I'm not knocking off any stars for the saggy end portion, because the middle of the book in the alternate universe, and the plot is so good.<br /><br />The new audiobook narrated by Scott Brick is excellent. Released January 2014.
B000000I0I|5.0|It is difficult to describe Ommadawn to someone who hasn't heard it.  After having read most of the reviews on this site, you'd think that everyone was insane by saying that it was like &quot;falling in love for the first time.&quot;  However, these reviews are not exaggerating.  It's certainly Oldfield's greatest work (and that's up against some pretty stiff competition), as well as the greatest rock/folk instrumental album ever made.   The album is based around several very simple and elegant folk tunes, but these tunes are accented by swirling electronics, ethereal female vocals, African drums, and just about every other instrument under the sun.  Though the thought of long instrumental rock albums seems to intimidate most people (especially in the States), this album is VERY accessible.  The tunes are instantly singable and you won't even know that you just sat through an 18 minutes song and loved it.  One of it's strengths is it's energy and it's ability to flow effortlessly between sections, causing you to get completely caught up in it's magic.  Though a couple of people have referred to this album as &quot;New Age,&quot; it is ANYTHING but.  It's dark, moody, and has a driving rhythm throughout, and an incredible climax at the end of part one with screaming and anguished guitars. I can't properly describe the rush of emotion and intensity that this album possesses.  And for the reissue price, I think everyone should own this album.
B00004TH7Z|3.0|I have already written one review, where I gave this CD 5 stars. It was when this CD first came out, and I was very excited to say the least....Here is a more realistic view.<br />Now, I've got to be honest with myself. <br />This CD does not deserve 5 stars. It's a bit too drawn-out, and it's full of filler material. To me, Wicker Man, Dream Of Mirrors, and Nomad are the only songs worth listening to....The rest struggle in my opinion. <br />Not that this CD isn't worth buying, it's worth every penny, but I think they could have done a much better job writing material for this release, like where is Adrians' input???<br />I think one of the main ingredients that makes Maiden what it is, is that they are a great song writing band.....I think Adrian needs to get more involved for the next release. <br />If you have heard Dickinsons' &quot;Accident Of Birth&quot;, or &quot;Chemical Wedding&quot;, you hear the Adrian influences, and it makes all the difference. Those two releases were miles ahead of anything Maiden did during that time. To be completely honest, I think Steve Harris' songwriting has become way too drawn-out, I hate to say it, and I never thought I would, but his songs have become boring. <br />Maiden has forever been a GOD to me. I've been a fan since 81', and I was very happy to see Bruce and Adrian come back to Maiden, but something is still a miss. I think they need to get rid of Janick Gerrs, and get back to basics.<br />I do think this release is the strongest they've had since &quot;Seventh Son&quot;, but I also think it could have been much better. <br />Let me say this about &quot;Brave New World&quot;, it's not the best Maiden you can buy, but it's better than anything they did after &quot;Seventh Son&quot;. I'm not complaining, but for someone who grew up watching these guys put out epic releases like &quot;Number&quot;,&quot;Piece&quot;,&quot;Powerslave&quot;,&quot;Somewhere&quot;, and &quot;Seventh Son&quot;, this release falls alittle short.....<br />It's great to have them back, and I can't wait to hear what they do next, but at least we all know one thing........Maiden's Back!!!<br />UP THE IRONS!!!!!!
0790735954|4.0|This movie is worth owning for the first half of the film. Lee Ermy is outstanding as GySgt Hartman, and the boot camp scenes are just like being there (I was). Unfortunately the second half of the movie is a let down. The battle is supposed to portray the 1968 battle for Hue City, the scenery is very good, and reminiscent of the real location but the actors do a terrible job of portraying the combat troops. They seem to be more of an armed mob running around with no direction and expending massive amounts of ammunition for no purpose. Those of you that think this is an accurate portrayal of Vietnam are sadly mistaken.
0792156684|1.0|This is so realistic. An old lady still deeply in love, with some kid she spent one night with more then 70 years ago. Does this not make sense to everyone. I mean she only had a husband and family, 'course she'd still remembers the guy. Let's see other problems? Too many horrid acting for one (Leo's best scene was when he looked like a frog sinking down down down...) The only good actor was the computer generated one who bounced off the propeller. Don't waste you time.
B00004XOWM|3.0|There are a few songs on this album I actually liked: Rollin'(Urban Assult remix), Getcha Groove On, and My Way (without DJ Lethal's annoying record scratch.) Some other songs are OK.<br />Even Limp fans will probabally get dissapointed at this. Buy 311 or (hed) pe if you want rap rock. Also, this is an imitation of rap and rock. And RATM are a nu-metal band, one step ahead of LB. Sometimes I feel like calling them Limp Shitzkit. The Beastie Boys seem to be the only people who can be rap and rock at the same time. <br />On this album it starts of with an NIN tooken song combo. I guess he thought he could do this because &quot;Starf**kers, Inc.&quot; was on part of Carly Simon's Your So Vein. But at least he doesn't go crazy about Carly. Fred says this on it: You wanna f**k me like an animal and you're the perfect drug.... Nine Inch Nails get knocked the f**k out. Also, on My Generation there's a redundant part: So go ahead and talk s**t, and talk s**t about me, so go ahead and talk s**t about a different generation we just don't give a f**k and we won't ever give a f**k until you you give a f**k about me and a different generation. Rollin''s rip off: Breathe in now breathe out (tooken from Bush's Machinehead.) <br />This is almost as annoying as the lyrics on 3 Dollar Bill Yall$, and on that album the best he can do is cover songs from George Michael and Paula Abdul. Also as annoying as the sexistness. I know that since Australia's Big Day Out had the heart attack incident, LB will sell more albums worldwide.
0789723107|4.0|Good Information! This was my first web design or usability book to read, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. I particularly found chapter 6 very informative. I teach computers to grades 1 thru 8 and I really put the info about the parts of a webpage to look for to good use when designing a lesson plan for webpage navigation. This book is very understandable. Also, the chapters on usability testing can be very helpful to any corporate web design teams.

B000002VCQ|5.0|Out of all the Whitney Houston albums, I still keep coming back to this one. It is almost a timeless piece that soothes the soul and senses.From her pop/dance oriented tracks like How Will I Know,Thinking About You, and Someone For Me to her almost jazz like-ballads You Give Good Love and Saving All My Love For You.The production and styles are very coherent along with the sequence of tracks.The more mid tempo styling of Take Good Care of My Heart (duet w/Jermaine Jackson)is classy and reminiscent of a song by another artist named Patti Austin titled Heat of Heat.Both tunes were seductive and moving with rich string and other classical arrangements in the pop, r&amp;b mix.While The Greatest Love of All may be a tear jerker to some and mush muzak to others it still is one of her all time powerful vocal ballads. Too bad I've seen so many talent shows, contests on t.v. over the years where you get that one Whitney Wanna Be beauty contestant who sings this very song and destroys it by going overboard with the emotional/vocal dramatics (the song begins to take on a mediocre flavor).Nobody can sing it like Whitney...
0553106635|5.0|With his epic series &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; Martin has created a truly unique fantasy series that stands apart from the rest of the genre. It is the grimmest series I've ever read but also the most realisitic and hence entertaining.   Sorcery and dragons are used sparingly, increasing the readers suspension of disbelief, and is completely free of elves, fairies, talking trees and other staples found in most fantasy literature. What Martin excels at, besides phenomenal character development, is building up readers expectations and then delivering the exact opposite.  Surprises are sudden and absolute.  Also, he obviously doesn't have a problem with killing off major characters as evidenced in this third installment.
0440219078|4.0|I loved the novel, The Giver.  It exposed the advanced world of utopia and its problems.  Although a utopian world has its benefits such as no poverty, hunger, and racism, it also restricts people from the simple benefits of life, such as being able to see colour, being able to make decisions on your own, and unexpected weather changes.  Although a utopian life may be desirable to many, living life w/out these benefits isn't living life at all.  Having a predictable and controlled environment is not at all satisfactory.  Lois Lowry has shown this to us through the eyes of a 12-year old child, Jonas.  <br />Another reason I like this book was because I had never read a story like it before.  It is very different from the normal books that I have read because it expands on society.  Each time I read it, it makes me think of how corrupt our society and world is.  I want to change our government, not to the point where it's communist or utopian, but enough that we won't have to worry about money, hunger, or devastation.  We would all have jobs and work to better ourselves.  We would be the land of opportunity that we never were.  <br />The book was going along smoothly until the very end.  I believe the end was very abrupt and incomplete.  It would have my final star if the last chapter had some sort of happy, if any, conclusion.
0345423496|2.0|I found the imagery in this book to be extremely awe inspiring.  Clarke's vision of the future is a masterful one.  And I like the quotes about how technology seems magical to those of the past.  Reminds me of my parents.   Overall however, i found the plot lacking.  The explanation of Poole's return is vastly unbelievable.  If you can get past that, the plot is very slow and cursory, and the ending leaves a lot to be desired.  It kind of leaves you hanging out there, wondering if he's going to do another sequel, or did he just run out of ideas?  If you're a fan, it's worth the read though for the imagery alone.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Okay.  I've read all of the reviews for this CD.  I thought about buying this CD.  I went and bought this CD.  I grew up with The Beatles so I have heard these songs approximately ONE BILLION times.  And I am NOT a gullible consumer.  What is amazing about this compilation is how the remastering process actually makes them sound BETTER than I have ever heard them before!  And the transition from MONO to STEREO is not as evident as you might think.  Hats off to the engineers on this one!  If you listen carefully, you can hear the maturity of the music through the years as well as the maturity of the equipment that all this is recorded on.  An amazing trip through time if you ask me.<br />You will NOT be disappointed and may even find yourself singing outloud with the Fab Four.  How can you beat THAT?  :-)
B00003W8NM|5.0|A movie that truly speaks for itself. The great chemistry between Norton and Pitt is explosive. Mix in Helena Bonham-Carter, and it becomes a powerful drink that'll leave you broken, bruised and begging for more.<br />Every frame of this film is a photographic work of art. And the special effects are phenominal, adding to the narritive and not dominating it.<br />Also, the soundtrack is incredible. The atmospheric effect with the Dolby 5.1 system really draws you into the movie. And you have to check out the humourous running commentary.<br />A must have for any collection, the first DVD I bought.
0792153189|5.0|Lots of people compare this movie and Armageddon.  I have to agree to a certain extent.  Armageddon was very much about the technology side by side with the relationships.  This movie was much, much more focused on the people and their relationships.  Starring Elijah Wood, Tea Leoni, Denise Crosby, Morgan Freeman, Maximillan Schell, and Mellisa Redgrave, Deep Impact is an incredibily moving movie that I enjoy watching again and again.
0446677450|3.0|This book is not what I expected. This isn't to say it doesn't have good points, but, it took a couple hundred pages to explain elementary concepts that really could have been summed up in 20 or 30 pages. Many of the financial ideas brought across are very broad in nature. The major concept is to build assets, reduce liabilities, use a corporation to legally reduce taxes, and to never stop trying. There were so many pages of 'fluff' that you could skip four pages and not miss anything that the next page didn't repeat. I felt like every chapter had the same point, but different heading. <br />Overall, it's a good read to get you thinking, but I'd recommend borrowing it rather than owning it.
0452282152|3.0|Read this for information about mid-seventeenth century family life, the business end of art, and for a look at how paintings such as these were seen by everyday citizens and the patrons who commissioned them.  The girl who stares out from the cover will entice many buyers, but once the reader is captured by the cover, the story does not deliver anywhere near the kind of experience the gaze of the young lady seems to promise, and, in all fairness, that is probably asking too much of the best writer.<br />This book has a thin plot which is capped off with a nice little twist at the end.  I went from page to page in search of some episode of substance, which would reveal more than I already knew about the characters.  It is one of those stories in which the reader knows from the get-go what the outcome will be: the young maid, carrying an obsessive crush on her master, does have her picture painted by him.  We also can figure out without too much trouble what will happen after that; so, what really counts in such a story is description, well-crafted sentences and character development.  I found this novel lacking in those respects, but in spite of that criticism, the writing pulled me in enough to want to read to the finish.<br />On the positive side, you will not be wasting your time if you read this with a color plate art book of Vermeer's work.  It will be a reintroduction to the paintings, and you will find that you want to see them again as Chevalier weaves them into her novel.
6304196938|3.0|I'm not American.  My first languege is not English.  So, I couldn't understand everything about this movie.  Their speaking is little bit fast for me.  I think that I couldn't understand what happened actually.  However, I was satisfied with this movie after I finished watching it. There is a love between Roger and Eve.  There is a battle with Van Damme.  While Roger and Eve tring to escape from Van Damme, there are many events which are very exiceting!  The mystery about Eve and the truth about George Kaplan....but the most exciting scene is the last part.  The climax pulls the viewers in.  Therefor, I think that the best part of this movie is the last part.

B00003CXDG|5.0|Let's take this movie into perspective.  It's Mission Impossible 2...not the first...or the last.  They're laying it out like the television series.  Each episode is different.  Each movie will be different and have a different feel to it...a different flavor.  We can't be too critical about how it was compared to the previous film.  The next one will be different still.  Enjoy the movie for what it is.  A journey into a world that most of us can't go.  The cinematography was very Woo.  It was fast paced and blended well with the soundtrack that accompanied it.  The acting was well done and the story may not have been completely original...but it is still fun to see all the action that takes place from beginning to end.  Buy this movie to have a good time and enjoy what these people have worked so hard to create for the audience.  A good cutting-edge cinimatic adventure film with loud music and exciting new stunts never before seen on film.  Enjoy.
6301978587|5.0|Just watched it for the first time.  &quot;Yentl&quot; is a beautiful story, touching and gentle in most places (except the tacked on inspirational ending), with Babs singing almost in a whisper half the time to fit the mood of the scenes.  Patinkin is terrific as the best friend, conflicted by his feelings; Amy Irving's Hadass, silent the first few times we see her, blossoms into a real human being in a world where women are not real.  (compare her reaction to first hearing Talmud to the way she uses it to seduce Anschel!)  <br />And if you -- gay or straight -- ever wondered why gay men love Barbara, this film tells you.  Yentl's alter-ego can easily be seen as a gay man, living in a world in which he so desperately wants to fit and yet cannot be himself.  He desire/struggle to come out of the closet of secrecy and lies mirrors that of so many men like him.  And judging by her portrayal, Babs understands this perfectly .  She's not afraid to be who she is, and neither is Yentl.  <br />See this movie.  Embrace the lush score and songs.  Thrill at the humor and romance -- you won't miss out. . .
0783211856|5.0|I was thinking recently about films that have lingered in the mind and heart.  An avid movie buff for years, there is simply no other film which has had the same impact on me as this utter masterpiece by Spielberg.  I will never forget seeing it the first time in the theater.  I was so stunned that I could not cry during the film itself.  About 20 minutes later, while dropping my girlfriend off  at her house, I simply lost it.  It was as if all the impact of the film hit at once.  I cried for 15 minutes straight.  What a testament to the power of this film.  That feeling has never left me.  I am 30 years old and have no family relation to the horrors of the Holocaust, but Steven Spielberg made me feel, deep inside, the unspeakable anquish of this uniquely evil event in history.  Simply put, every person on earth should see this film to truly understand the evil that is possible on this earth.  &quot;Schindler's List&quot; is a testament of remembrance to the 6 million Jews and others who died.  May there never be the need for such a film as long as life exists on this planet.
B00003CWNR|5.0|The boundaries of our lives sometimes seem self-ordained, while at other times they seem predetermined by a higher power, and life itself often becomes a quest to ascertain which is which.  And so it was with a young man who grew up an orphan in the State of Maine, in the years preceding World War II, in \\"The Cider House Rules,\\" directed by Lasse Hallstrom.  Under the tutelage and watchful eye of Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine), the administrator of the orphanage in which Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire) had lived his whole life, Homer, by 1943, had become quite knowledgeable and adept in the field of medicine.  What he lacked, however, was the formal education that would have enabled him to practice what he had learned, if indeed, he had so desired; which in fact he had not.  The orphanage was a world unto itself, a loving haven for unwanted children, but a place apart; and a larger world loomed just beyond it's perimeter, a world Homer Wells wanted to see.  And when circumstances present Homer with an opportunity to get away, he grabs it, and embarks upon his journey of discovery, much to the consternation of the good Dr. Larch, who fears that he has lost Homer-- whom he loves as a son-- to the world forever.  And forever is a long, long time.  Hallstrom presents the story with acuity and care, drawing upon the innate humanity of the characters--especially Dr. Larch and Homer-- to bring it all to life.  While Dr. Larch epitomizes the benevolent nature of man, one who has known the world and has come into his own, has found the place from which he can do some good, Homer represents the longings of youth; no longer a boy, but a man who must discover on his own what Dr. Larch already knows.  And, as it is in real life, it becomes a matter of experience; and though fate ultimately intervenes with a nudge in the right direction, it is Homer who decides the direction his own life will take-- it is he who finally realizes what is meant to be.  And under Hallstrom's steady and skillful hand, the journey becomes, not only Homer's, but the viewer's as well, as he mines the emotional depths of the characters, making them people with whom the audience will be readily able to identify.  Affecting an American accent for the first time in his career, Michael Caine gives a performance that deservedly earned him the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.  He brings Dr. Larch so vividly to life, capturing the deep concern and humanity of the man, while conveying his sincerity and exposing his vulnerability; it's a complete and real portrayal, enriched with nuance and altogether memorable.  As good as Caine is, however, the film clearly belongs to Maguire, who gives a masterfully understated performance as Homer.  There is such expression in the pacific nature he lends to the character, along with a sense of mature acceptance that serve to accentuate his inner yearnings, that make Homer so believable, a person with whom it is easy to sympathize and relate.  There is something of a wistful poet beneath his stoic, though gentle, outward appearance that makes him endearing.  With a subtle ability, Maguire makes it clear that Homer is a person of intrinsic good, and it gives not only the character, but the performance, a ring of truth and integrity.  It's exceptional work, and taken in conjunction with his turns in \\"The Ice Storm\\" and \\"Wonder Boys,\\" firmly establishes Maguire as one of the best young actors in the business today.  The extraordinary supporting cast includes Delroy Lindo (Mr. Rose), Charlize Theron (Candy), Paul Rudd (Wally), Jane Alexander (Nurse Edna), Kathy Baker (Nurse Angela), Kieran Culkin (Buster), Kate Nelligan (Olive Worthington), K. Todd Freeman (Muddy), Erykah Badu (Rose Rose) and Erik Per Sullivan (Fuzzy).  Highlighted by outstanding performances and the sensitive interpretation and delivery of the story by Hallstrom, \\"The Cider House Rules\\" is a touching excursion into the depths of human emotions, and a taste of what life is allabout.  More than just a film, it's an experience; one that will create a lasting impression on your soul, and one that absolutely must not be missed.

B00004ZAV3|5.0|This is a great compliation of songs, that has been hyped up for awhile. Man, are these guys ever not going to be incredible? Still hit the top of the charts thirty years after their demise. That's what I call some great musicians. Back to the cd, One features the tops songs from the various Beatle albums excluding the White Album. Not one song on the cd is bad, but it's too bad the good songs from the White Album weren't on there. Oh well. I have all the cds, but I still got this. The artwork in the booklet is worth the measly 15 dollars, let alone some of the greatest songs ever made in history.
B00004XQ83|5.0|Since I bought this CD last week I've listened to it again and again and again. Then I got my office mate hooked and she bought two, one for her and one for her parents.  This is one of those albums that you can get lost in. &quot;Down to the River to Pray&quot; and &quot;O Death&quot; send chills down my spine. They haunt me throughout the day even when I'm not playing the album. All of this music will stay with you long after you hit eject (if you ever do).
B000002UAX|5.0|Man, I really don't need to type much on this review. If you are reading this, you are already wasting time not buying or listening to this album. It is great. Not any band can write thirty consecutive good songs. Only the Beatles. and the white album proves it. buy it, period. if you don't, you are an incompetent human, who likes to eat feces for brunch.
0451199871|5.0|Agatha Christie's the Body in the Library is truly a great mystery book. Of course, Agatha Christie does not need any additional praise from humble me to boost her reputation as an unparallelled author of mysteries. In this book, the corpse of a young woman is found in the library of Gossington Hall, the home of a well-to-do colonel and his wife. Miss Marple, in conjunction with the police, sets out to investigate. She comes upon many discoveries, and it can be seen that many parties benefit from the death of the woman in the library and/or have the opportunity to kill her. As the investigations progress, a possibly related incident occurs: a car burned to shrapnel in a neighboring region. Miss Marple, of course, with her impeccable investigative prowess and sharp eye for detail, solves the mystery methodically and impressively. The outcome is dazzling and this book is a great read for all mystery-lovers out there.
B00004X0Q0|4.0|hmmm. i heard a lot of great things about this band before I bought the cd. I had heard most of it in a lot of clubs before, but not really had I took a seat to listen to it deeply. Man, the cd is cool. The good thing about the band is the fact that it is unique, and they stand alone. The recording sounds cool, in that of a Steve Albini-esque sound. The sound is kinda dirty, which is neat in my opinion. The only thing is once the singer starts, he never stops the persistent yell he does. It usually is the same pitch, and after a few songs of listening, it gets really annoying. The second song (Pattern Against User) is probably the best, since he shows that he can sing, and it really gets stuck in your head. Get the cd, but beware of the repetitive monotone of the singing.
0140441409|4.0|Any body that has a desire to learn should read this book. It has a lot of wisdom that can be gained from reading it, although if you really want to gain wisdom, you should read Proverbs from the Bible. The book is very well organized and there are a lot of seperate sections that contain different thoughts Marcus had.<br />Even though a great deal of knowledge can be gained through reading this book, there are some boring parts. However, these are easy to skip over.<br />Over all, I would definately recommend this book.
B000002UB3|5.0|Even though almost every song seems like it is written by a different person, Abbey Road is personally my favorite album by the Fabulous Four. It seems that all the Beatles wanted to do their own thing on this album, but it turned out to be nothing short of amazing. My favorite songs are Here Comes the Sun King, and I Want You (She's So Heavy), but the rest of the album is great. It is good no matter what state of mind you're in, especially good if you're under the influence. Those who don't appreciate the Beatles should buy this album, because it seems to summarize their whole career on one great cd. buy it, if you don't already own it. (shame on you)
0684853523|5.0|What most impressed me about this book was the ease at which it cuts to the point. I think we've all had times in our life where someone else felt that something we did was out of their reach, but we knew that there was nothing mystical about it. I'd almost re-title this book &quot;Demystifying Writing&quot;. He does an amazing job of cutting through the fluf and getting to the heart of it; hard work. Put in your time and follow the rules. And along the way he adds a lot of humor and a bit of insparation. <br />That, along with the short biography makes this a great insight into the person who is Stephen King. I'd highly recomend this to just about anyone..
B0000029GA|5.0|With a style untouchable and rhymes that are no less tnan amazing...Nas shows experience in the game at a mere 20 years old.  Not many people his age can come through with a debut this impacting as it was in 94'.  With the help of Gangstarr's DJ Premier and Q-tip this album is a true hip hop classic and it established Nas as an amazing rapper.
B00004XOWM|1.0|How did people get away with calling this a rock band?  This album shows that Fred Durst is nothing but a rapper, and not that good of one at that.  The talent of the musicians is not all the way their either.  Wes Borland spends too much time putting make-up on to practice and get better, their bassist is slow, and doesn't have what it takes, and the drummer is a geek.  I don't see how this is selling so much, but it just goes to show what kind of music my country is into.  Pure RAP.
6304169558|5.0|There's something that always gets on my nerves: When people rate and review DVDs, they only talk about the DVD itself and not the actual film. I mean, if they think there's nothing extra on the DVD, then they'll give the movie a bad rating. But what about the actual film itself? Have those people even really paid attention to the film or just complained about the DVD? That's why I suggest to people that they watch the films first on video or in the movie theater BEFORE seeing it on DVD so they will actually rate and review the film instead of just the DVD.<br />Anyway, TWISTER is an excellent film. Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton make the perfect leading pair; they have a fantastic, supurb supporting cast as well. The special effects for the film are just amazing and the special effects are what makes the film so interesting. The plot is OK, but it's also kind of predictable. Even before watching this film you can tell that Jo (Helen Hunt) and Bill (Bill Paxton) will not only get their creation, Dorathy, working, but will also get back together again. The film is also kind of long, but I guess there was a lot happening and the producers and director thought that a long movie would be perfect for the film. This film is a must-see for anyone who loves action-packed, adventure films!
0790743213|4.0|Who can forget North by Northwest and Cary Grant running through a cornfield? This movie has a very interesting scenario which is mixing suspense,sophisticated romance and comedy. Grant is Roger Thornill, a New York ad company president  who is the target of complex and sinister events when somebody mistake him for a special undercover agent. Eva Marie Saint brings a good perfomance to her role as a delicate, elegant and mysterious blonde  who wins the heart of Roger. In other words this old school movie is very interesting and still a very good movie almost 50 years later.
B00000K2SC|5.0|I have never been so intrigued by a video, the Matrix is where it's at for today in the movie industry.  I have never been able to watch a video more than twice due to excrutiating boredom,  but i have sat through the matrix 10+ times and find something new everytime.  Not only does the movie have killer fighting scenes, but it's ability to make you look deeper and actually have to think helps make this the movie of the century.    The movie line was believeable, and though it may appear corny at first, after watching several times paying close attention to the action, you'll notice it is superbly done(take for axample Neo in the helicopter rescuing his mentor).  It's almost as if the brothers who wrote this made the video, watched it over and over again finding each little detail that may have appeared unbelievale or corny and fixed it, and then watched it again just to make sure.   In this rather serious and deep movie they add just enough comic relief,  while still maintening(and not detracting from) the theme and story line.  The foreshadowing was excellently done,  partly due to it's subtlety.  It's metehpors and symoblism to the bible was also a nice touch.           I enjoyed the casting, because due to the fact that the cast wasn't very well known so it wasn't easy to confuse the actors roles in this movie with those of past works.    Over all this is the best movie, bar none, that I have ever seen. I cannot wait for the sequals which are in the works as you are reading this.
0446525537|1.0|This, as all of Sparks' books, are just romantic, predictable, sappy drivel.  By page 5, most readers know exactly where this is going.  There's much better stuff out there to be reading than this, folks.

0671027344|5.0|This is my favorite book of all time.  I think most people can relate to different parts of the book.  Like when he first starts high school and all of his friends have changed and he doesn't really know anyone.  Almost everyone I know has had a very similar experience to that.  I read this book over and over again but I never get bored.  I think every teen should read this book.
0790743213|4.0|It was indeed a great movie.You will experience the same confusion which Roger Thornhill did because brilliant Hitchcock shows you just a little bit of information about the mystery he unfolds. This gives the film tension and thrills, fascinating the viewer. This film is famous for some dramatic scenes like the cropduster's attack, the witty escape from the auction house ,the fight on Mt.Rushmore and so on. Hitchcock didn't forget to add some humor with his outstanding suspense and tension and Cary Grant is talented enough to deliver his lines. Eve Kandall is also very  attractive for romance during the danger which makes the film richer.Wonderful~~!!
6304981635|5.0|Bruce Lee was the greatest martial artist ever, and I think this was his best film.  The martial arts action is excellent in this movie.  Bruce Lee's match against Bob Wall is one of the best fight sequences filmed.  The only other fight scene that compares is Bruce Lee's fight against Chuck Norris in Return of the Dragon.  Bob Wall could really take some punishment which makes the fight scene look all the more realistic.<br />Even the other stars, Jim Kelly and John Saxon, are adequate, though we'd much rather see Bruce.  We're cheated of seeing Bruce take on Bolo in one scene so that John Saxon could get some more screen time.  Still, there's plenty of action from Bruce as he takes on teams of palace gaurds who are actual tri-ad members.  John Saxon actually went into the film thinking that he would be the star, and Warner Bros., concerned that Bruce Lee wouldn't be able to carry the film as an asian actor, let Saxon believe this as they filmed it.<br />I think this is better than BL's other films for several reasons.  For one thing, this is the only Lee film with Bruce's actual voice, and not some stupid sounding dubbed voice-over.  Also, the choreography is more realistic than the others, with the possible exception of Return of the Dragon, which was entirely choreographed by Bruce Lee.  Bruce Lee did much of the choregraphy for the Raymond Chow films, Fists of Fury and The Chinese Connection, but not all of it.  Therefore there's a lot of phony looking wire-work in those movies.  Return of the Dragon was the only movie directed by Bruce and is definately worth getting after ETD.  However it sometimes looks a little amateurish and the soundtrack and production's not nearly as good as ETD.  Game of Death is the last Bruce Lee film anyone should get as he only had 28 minutes of it done before he died. A double was used for the rest of the movie.  The movie is notable for Bruce's fight with Kareem Abdul Jabar and also his nunchaku fight with Dan Inosanto, Bruce's training partner.<br />This version of ETD features a cut scene where Bruce discusses eastern philosophy with a monk.  The dialogue is crucial to a later scene where Bruce figures out a way to defeat his adversary.  Warner Bros. originally cut the scene because they thought western audiences wouldn't understand it.  The source print is very good and I didn't see any flaws.  The soundtrack is remastered in DD but still mostly comes out of the center channel. It also has extensive interview with Bruce and original trailors.  If you get only one martial arts movie, get this one!training partner.<br />This version of ETD features a cut scene where Bruce discusses eastern philosophy with a monk.

078401213X|1.0|There are no zeroes in the hebrew numerological system.  It is not possible to create a specific 216 letter word in Hebrew given a 216 digit number with zeroes in it. This movie is a terrible mess all over.
B00004XQP4|5.0|Green Day is my favorite band of all time, and i've loved them since kerplunk, and they have definitely changed from those days. People call them sell outs but true fans stick with them. Personally, i think the new greenday is so much cooler because they change their sound, and unlike most punk rock bands, every song on their cd is unique and different. Billie Joe is an awesome songwriter and can go so far past the normal punk 3 power chord song. This album stretches out and reaches so many types of music, and reaches so many different topics. Its not little love songs like most songs, but it goes about life, and church on sunday shows how the band has matured and talks about the relationships with their wives (all 3 almost 30) and shows the hope they have now, and compromise and how they want to live. Sure dookie was fun, it was loud, crazy and billie screamed about masturbation, growing up, and his clever tunes about how much life sucks and how he's a slacker. It was great to listen to but warning saves that, and adds more, &quot;castaway&quot; goes back to &quot;burnout&quot; days from dookie and &quot;minority&quot; sounds like something from insomniac, while &quot;macys day parade&quot; is an excellent ballad similar to &quot;Time of Your Life.&quot; Here is a rundown of the 12 track record:<br />1. Warning - Lyrics are real cool, simple, catchy, good, not my favorite. 8/10 2. Blood Sex and Booze - Reminds me of &quot;Hitchin a Ride.&quot; Great change of pace, one of the harder songs especially on the chorus. 9/10 3. Church on Sunday - Meaningful, great chorus, definitely on of the best. 10/10 4. Fashion Victim - Nice little storylike song lyrically referring to billie, nice riff, good song. 8.5/10 5. Castaway - One of the punk rocker songs, goes back to the older greenday, nice lyrics. 9/10 6. Misery - Shows the difference in Warning. Definitely doesnt sound like greenday. sounds like a mexican/russian folk song, my least favorite song, but the chorus is cool. 7.5/10 7. Deadbeat Holiday - Really GOOD. The verses are great, and one of the better songs, has a good feeling to it, nice rhymes. 9.5/10 8. Hold On - Definitely a Beatles influenced song. Deep meaning, about hardships in life, and how you have to keep going, nice tunes, great song. 8.5/10 9. Jackass - nice description of somebody, maybe a form of jealousy in it, also deeper, very cool. 8.5/10 10. Waiting - The outro is wonderful, and im wondering where the song leads, once again, not something the older greenday could do, AWESOME. 10/10 11. Minority - The big hit, very catchy, nice little hook on the pledge, chorus is a little shaky, and might get annoying, still great. 9/10 12. Macys Day Parade - Controversial meanings, but great, the chorus is excellent, a nice closer to the cd. <br />LISTEN TO THIS CD LOUD, IT IS SO GOOD.
6304428952|5.0|I recently watched Rain Man, for what was probably at least the tenth time as it is on television alot.  It is one of the best movies of the 1980s', and it has without doubt, one of the best performances ever seen on film.  Dustin Hoffman was amazing as Raymond Babbitt, an autistic man, whose younger brother, Charlie, played quite well by Tom Cruise, abducts him from the institution he is in in order to get his share of inheritance money.  The character of Charlie is very selfish and greedy, but as the film goes on he changes for the better.  He takes Raymond clear across the country by car because Raymond won't fly. Watching this film again made me realize that it is really one of the greatest films I've seen.  It's a bittersweet story of brotherly love, dramatic at times, but has a great deal of comedy blended in.  This is a film to be cherished for generations. I highly recommend Rain Man.  The performances by both Dustin Hoffman, who won the Oscar for best actor(very well deserved!), and Tom Cruise are outstanding.  I believe this to be one of the first films that Cruise had a real substantial character with depth to him.  Watch Rain Man...you won't be disappointed.
B00000IAU3|5.0|Nothing I could describe could do this talented songstress justice.  I havent heard a CD this refreshing and diverse in years.  You can easily close your eyes and get lost in her voice.   The lyrics are interesting and the musical accompaniment is perfectly fitting.  This is definetely one for the collection.  I have one at home and one in my car (good &quot;sing along&quot; cd).  I cant wait for a new release.
B00004TRD8|5.0|This comes in as my second favorite movie of all time.  It's 10 years old, and the special effects still kick serious butt.  The story, while involving some Sci-Fi cliches, is well done.  You grow to really care about the characters.   I haven't even mentioned the action yet - the scenes involving the T-1000 fighting the T-101 are incredible.  The action is intense and never really has the 'been there, done that' feel.   This is easily Arnold's best movie, and among the best Sci-Fi films ever made.

B000058983|5.0|There's nothing quite like this record. The opening tune Alone Again Or is one of my all time favorites--its sweeping grandeur perfectly captures the nervous romanticism of the era. Essential listening.
B000056N8X|1.0|I loved the first and third movie but this one has no spirit at all. This is just one long episode of the TV series (same actors, bad script, ...). Christophe Lamber appears in some few key scenes so the studio can pretend it was a film for movie theaters. If you're not a big fan of the TV series, don't waist your money.
6305073341|5.0|Hailed by Ken Russell as the &quot;greatest science fiction film since 'Metropolis'&quot;, &quot;Robocop&quot;, a modern sci-fi classic, is a tale of a heavily injured cop who is reconstructed into a cyborg by science, and who avenges himself on the criminals who attempted to murder him. The satire of the future is dark and gleeful (with an excellent script by Edward Neumier and Michael Miner) and the film is directed with great ingenuity and flair by Paul Verhoeven (to whose credit are also &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; and &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;). It spawned two inferior sequels (both which lack the wit and flamboyance of the original) and an abysmal TV series aimed at a young audience.
B00004U8H4|5.0|Mesmerizing adaptation of the controversial novel by the same name, American Psycho scores on every conceivable level.  As a psychological thriller there are none better.  As a gere film it's among the best of it's kind.  And as a black comedy it's rivaled only by the 1989 cult classic Vampires Kiss, to which it bears a striking resemblence.  In short it's the best film of the early 21st century and one of my all time favorites.<br />Christian Bale, his name above the title for the first time in his career, stars as Patrick Bateman, a narcissistic Wall Street yuppie who may or may not be a serial killer, depending on your point of view.  By that I mean, second time director Mary Harron (avoiding the sophomore slump) leaves the movie open to interruption.  And if you're looking for easy answers there aren't any here.  The euphoric tone in which the story unfolds seems to suggest, in retrospect, that the movie may actually be the elaborate fantasy of a very deranged individual.  Or maybe it's the setting, Reagan-era New York, that makes it seem so alien.  Either way it's a tremendously thought-provoking film that should have people talking for a long time to come.<br />Just imagine if Leonardo DiCaprio were in the lead?  It'd have been interesting to see if he could have made such sophisticated art house fare fly with mainstream American.  But at the same time he would have deprived us of one of the best performances I can remember, ever!  It's not that Chris Bale looses himself in the character so much as Patrick Bateman has no character, and it's that understanding that he brings to the role.  He's always acting, which is an important component to the performance because Bateman is acting himself, just trying to fit in.  And he does, which is most disturbing of all.  Not the blood or the gore, which is toned down from the book, but the fact that he fits in so well.  Maybe that's the most tellling statement of all, to say that society bears the responsibilty for having created the Patrick Bateman's of the world.<br />His rampage begins by taking the life of a homeless man, to which he feels his financial status entitles him to.  He moves on to supposed &quot;productive&quot; members of society who, despite all their money, never seem to be doing much work.  It's then, after killing Paul Allen (Jared Leto), that he finds himself being questioned by a private investigator (Willem Dafoe), seemingly more interested in flirting with him than interrogating him.  I'm not sure if this was intentional on Dafoe's part but it adds to an already layered cast of characters.<br />Especially interesting of that bunch is Cara Seymour in a performance so drop dead hysterical (excuse the in joke) that she'll have you laughing long after the movie's over.  She plays Christie, a street walker who falls victim to Bateman's most violent fantasy.  This is one of those tongue-in-cheek moments that manages to be both terrifying and funny at the same time.<br />Of course, I don't mean to suggest this for everybody, because as most of the best films usually are, it's of an acquired taste.  Anyone not willing to suspend disbelief and buy into the premise should be advised to stay away.  Especially when you consider you're being asked to invest in a protagonist who has essentially no redeeming qualities except for the fact that he's potrayed by an actor of immeasurable talent, Christian Bale, whose sure to win over more fans (known as Baleheads) with this star-making performance.<br />So for those of you with no qualms over endearing yourself to a really bad guy, you're in for a smart, scary thriller that's one of the most chilling of this or any other year.
0060977493|1.0|I consider this book the written version of modern art's &quot;big yellow dot&quot;.  In any modern art museum you'll find a large black canvas with nothing but a big yellow dot on it.  No matter what obtuse meaning pseudo-intellectuals ascribe to that painting, it remains that it's no more than a big yellow dot.<br />&quot;God of Small Things&quot; is the written equivalent.  It will no doubt continue to be popular in some circles as some readers ascribe deep meaning to its confusing plot lines and verbiage.  But deep in my heart I believe the vast majority of people are saying (if only under their breath), &quot;Why in the world did I read this book?&quot;
0394800389|4.0|I tought hat Fox In Sox was an good book.I didn't give the book five stars because it would be hard for a little kid to say all the tongue twisters. All though the tongue twisters of kind of messed up they are fun to read. Also I thought that the pictures were funny. Also I thought that the made up words were fun to read also. I think the advice on the cover is nice because it is hard to read the book fast the first time because of the choice of words. All in all this was a good book.
B00003CXE7|4.0|I would have probably liked the movie MUCH better if someone (ahem..a reviewer from this site) didn't say what happens at the end (if you've seen the movie, you know what I mean). Overall, a good movie with tight special effects.
B00000J2KT|4.0|If Stanley Kubrick's &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; stopped after its harrowing boot camp sequence, it'd be a 5-star masterpiece.  The problem is the film's two-part structure.  The first story it tells is such a compelling and fresh take on familiar war-movie material, there's no way the second half can live up to it. <br /> Matthew Modine stars as Joker and serves as the narrarator.  The first sequence takes place in boot camp, where Joker and the other recruits learn what it means to be a modern warrior.  R. Lee Ermey, as the DI, completely dominates this half; his character gets almost all the movie's best lines and is such an original and powerful character, the story never quite recovers after his exit.  The boot camp scenes have a nightmarish quality; most effective is the lecture where Ermey praises the sharpshooting skills of former Marines such as Lee Harvey Oswald.  I can't think of another film with such a boot camp setting that matches &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; in intensity- not &quot;Sands of Iwo Jima,&quot; certainly not the otherwise enjoyable comedy &quot;Biloxi Blues.&quot; <br /> Then the movie moves to Vietnam in time for the Tet Offensive and the Marine battle at Hue City, and despite its increasing violence, the story begins to sag and feel a bit repetitive.  Joker, now  a combat reporter, meets up with a rifle squad for the fighting at Hue.  The combat scenes have a grungy veracity, and when the troops finally enter the city and meet a sniper, there's a growing terror and suspense... unfortunately, the payoff scene runs much to long, with a pat and disappointing moral quandary for Joker and his fellow Marines.  It's as if Kubrick wasn't sure his themes of dehumanization and brutality have been slammed home enough.  But believe me, they have. <br /> Still, &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; has to be considered one of the best war movies.  Instead of merely focusing on the action, it examines the psychology of the battlefield mind.  The Marines are close to the edge, and their comaraderie borders on the psychotic.  One in particular laments that back home, he won't have anyone around worthy enough to shoot.  Very eerie and effective. <br /> Standouts besides the amazing Ermey include Vincent D'Onofrio as a dim-witted screw-up nicknamed &quot;Pyle&quot; and Adam Baldwin (from &quot;My Bodyguard&quot; and &quot;Independence Day&quot;) as the ultra-mean Animal Mother.
6305090564|5.0|From the start this movie packs a whallop. The various charecters in this movie, all have their cinematic moments. Even the creature has some great scenes. The music really makes you want to get up and run for your life!! I would really give this film a 10+++++
6304196938|4.0|This movie is one of Hitchcock's masterpieces.  When I watched it, I noticed that there were many differences between 1960s and today, which were about fashions, life styles, romances, technologies, and actions.  While for the time the clothing, scene designs, and special effects must have seemed very modern, today the styles are  hip and retro.  Moreover, when you watch carefully, you can find un-changed scenes such as the pub which is in Plaza Hotel  and Mt. Rushmore.  If you watch this movie, you can find many things about 50s fashions.  I like this movie and you should watch this great masterpiece!

B00000892G|5.0|great job ! mr. dave dionisius de feis, i cant believe that in the world exists such a band, is the best heavy-melodic thrash that i have listened to, there`s a couple of instumental songs,and all the rest of the songs are a great job by dave de feis and ed pursino, i really thank this life to have this cd with me, (i got it at amazon.com!), it`s one of the gratest compacts that virgin steele have created, it`s really worth awarded to purchase this cd, right now at amazon.com!!!

0783116934|5.0|This film is excellent in all point of view, the work of Donald Shuterland and Stephen Rea was suberb!, and also the story is really shocking, mainly because it's a Real Story! I absolutely recommend this DVD for all lovers of thrillers, and specially for serial killer fans
0780631684|5.0|A scary, twisted nail biter.  No plot to figure out just lots of twists and scary momemnts as the Grim Reaper goes after these kids he missed the first time around.  Loved it.
B000002UJQ|2.0|Allow me to be the voice of dissention/reason here. Perhaps my expectations were too high after all the hype about this album, but this is some of the most bland, reconstituted swill I've ever heard. This sounds like watered-down Beatles and Pink Floyd with some U2 thrown in. I don't mind music that is somewhat derivative, but this  music is just nauseatingly formulaic. This album is one of the most glaring musical examples of the mind-boggling 70's retro movement. It's strictly for those who are still pining away for a &quot;lost&quot; Beatles album, or can't get over the old &quot;British invasion&quot; days. I guess it's okay if you want to like this album, but its idle to pretend its some sort of instant classic, or stroke of genius. Blahhh.
B000059MEK|5.0|With the introduction of a new album all the crazy fans around the world hope and yearn for new tracks with the same style as the old ones and i think they will be quite pleased with this cd. It is like being trapped in a video game with a large disco ball chasing you all around. The repetition of synths and the introduction of new ones leave you staring at objects the once seemed so bland but now have an apparent complexity. It is definitely a party cd and one to add to your home collection. Best promo of the month! songs to check out : - harder better faster stronger - one more time - crescendolls
B000003TAW|5.0|Wow...what can I say?  This is definitely one of my favorite CDs of all time.  &quot;Say It Ain't So&quot; is just so packed with emotion that it makes me cry every time I hear it.  I don't know anyone who doesn't like Weezer- Some of my Deadhead friends do, my DMB friends, and my Doors friends...three very different types of music.  I definitely reccomend that you get this CD, you will not regret it!  Also get Pinkerton, it's also a great CD.

B000003BF4|5.0|Sympathy For the Devil has always been a really good Stone's song, but after hearing this version it's now my favorite.  The woo wooos that enter mid-way through the studio version, which sounded alright at first but eventually get annoying, are not in this version.   Instead one of the best guitar jams I've ever heard replaces it.  It's right up there with the Comfortably Numb solo from Pink Floyd's Pulse- which needs to be watched to get the full effect.  Jumpin Jack Flash sounds so good you'll never want the guitar riff to end.  The guitar in this album is so raw and hard it defines rock-n-roll.  The lyrics of Stray Cat Blues are pretty funny too. Listen to them and you'll understand why this song didn't make the pop charts.  Honkey Tonk Women is pretty good but in this case the original is better.  Midnight Gambler is the live one used on Hot Rocks.   The rest of the songs are great too and the quality of sound is excellent- you wouldn't think this was recorded in 69.   This is one of the best live albums ever I only wish it included more songs from the concert.  If you don't like this you don't like the Stones.
6302206294|2.0|...was our name for this movie when it first came out, and it fits. Maid Marian is Ninja Woman the first time we see her, but in the attempted rape scene, all she can do is scream &quot;Robin, Robin!&quot; and throw a candle at the Sheriff. Historical inaccuracies abound. Ditto all that has been said (all true) about Costner's accent. Stick to The Adventures of Robin Hood (Flynn in tights still comes off as far more masculine than Costner every thought of being), or the Disney Version (it has a few fun songs by Roger Miller instead of that abrasive Bryan Adams tune. Beautiful production, lousy script). And why did they have to add a Ceasearean, Celts, and Robin's illegitimate brother? They didn't think the script was convoluted enough?  Brightest moment: Sean Connery's return from captivity. Too bad they didn't rescue Richard a little earlier; maybe he could have saved this film.
B000001G5L|5.0|I wouldn't say that this is my favourite performance of the Beethoven. In fact I have about 10 different performances of this concerto, and if I could morph all 10 into 1 then that would be my ideal. Nevertheless, what I like about this performance is the spaciousness that Mutter gets. Someone once remarked that the first movement of this work is a work of &quot;lofty architecture&quot; and I tend to agree with that description. Mutter's playing is very precise, and wonderful, especially in the high registers. Yes, perhaps there isn't much of her personality in it, but that's the Karjan way IMHO. Nevertheless, it's quite stunning. I often come back to this one, on account of the first movement. It may be slow, but it's quite captivating. Not bad at all for a girl of 16. I certainly recommend it.
0446677450|2.0|I have a different perspective on the value of this book. The two stars are earned because it is a wake up call for the masses. Why is it that in the United States the large majority work for the small minority? This has been a land of opportunity for many, yet most of us do not pursue our own living, we work for others. This book asks us to think along these lines and question that within us that stalls us. I am puzzled as to why exactly this book is a best seller, yet I must refer to the book itself for the largest possible reason; marketing. The book talks about sales and marketing. Perhaps one day we (you and I) will be intellegent enough to purchase merchandise based on VALUE, as opposed to the sellers ability to market a product.  I feel that this book is insulting. The book is written as if &quot;poor dad&quot; has all the dysfunctions, and &quot;rich dad&quot; has all the real important answers. &quot;Rich dad&quot; is somewhat of a hero. My feeling about &quot;rich dad&quot; is that his fervor for wealth influenced his treatment of others (specifically his employees). Even if it may be true that his employees would work for anyone for low wages, that these people had little self-respect--that in no way gives licence to &quot;rich dad&quot; to pay the lowest possible wages for the sake of the highest possible profits.  This is a great psychology book. This book is the psychology of oppression written by the oppressors.  This book is the argument for capitalism. I do not need a book of the argument for capitalism. My country is the result of that argument, and there are many aspects of this countries' capitalism that are far more dysfunctional than the sum of its typical citizens. One day we will learn how poorly we have been as our brothers keeper. Folks, we treat each other like s***. The two stars are because this book points out how we treat ourselves financially. It did not earn the other three because the book itself is the evidence of how we treat each other.other.
B0000042GM|5.0|This box will have the width of a finger on your shelf, but will provide you with endless hours of boundless enjoyment.  Julius Katchen not only showed that he was a master of the Brahms piano repertoire in the 1960s, but London also awarded him amazingly realistic and faithful piano recording.  The transfers to 6 CDs have been totally successful, amongst the very best in London's &quot;Collectors' Edition&quot; series.<br />If you have a chance to sample what's here, try the early Scherzo in Eb, Op 4, a wonderfully robust, powerful work, and the late Op 117 Intermezzi - reflective, reposeful works.  You'll also find some of the brilliant sets of variations - masterpieces that are fiendishly difficult to play - and the complete sets of waltzes and Hungarian dances.<br />Vehemently recommended.
014100018X|5.0|A beutiful, rich, delicious novel that is very hard to put down.  The change between Vianne's point of view and that of the town priest helps to draw you in and generates real emotion for each of the characters.  Sit back with a cup of hot chocolate (because you'll crave one before long), put your feet up and read a very original story that will take you to meet beutiful people in a beutiful town that you'll want to stay a part of.
0451450523|5.0|It's just like Molly said to Cully, &quot;You have it backward. There's no such person as you, or me, or any of us.&quot; Molly Grue and Schmendrick are real, and we are the legends. Thats the way you feel when you're reading this book. I remembered the movie faintly from when I was a child, mainly the nightmares that the Red Bull gave me, and I was wandering through the shelves of the local library and this book jumped out at me. As I looked at its spine I could vaguely remember one line from the movie. &quot;They passed down all the roads long ago, and the Red Bull ran close behind them and covered their footprints.&quot; And so of course I checked it out and preceeded to read what I feel is the second greatest fantasy novel I've ever read (right behind Michael Ende's The Neverending Story which you should also read). The descriptive language Beagle uses in this book is like poetry, and ther is always a slight hint of humor that floats around even when your heart is breaking for the amazing cast of characters. I won't try to describe the Molly or Schmendrick or Lir or the unicorn, for my words pale in comparison to Beagle's who makes it seem that she stands there in front of the reader in all her glory. This book is a must for anyone who calls themselves a fan of literature, and especially those who crave magic in their world. This book is beautiful.
B00004Z4WR|1.0|If you want a cool car chase movie, get the original.  This was the worst movie of the year.  I'd rather watch A Night at the Roxbury than to suffer through this movie again.
B000006TRV|5.0|Not many people would argue that the true test of quality, and especially in music, is time. Considering that The Wall was released in 1979 and is still so popular speaks volumes. That is particularly true for this album, especially since it is not a mainstream commercial pop music and the band was not selected by a marketing guru who knew how to target the right market using the right channels. This is a music written by 4 Cambridge educated talented people whose aim was to write a real music about real feelings. The album is full of originallity which can be matched by few other bands. If you are an educated person who can read-between-the-lines and understand the full complexity of this music, it will touch you. And more you listen to it, more you appreciate it, more you want to know the story behind the album. But if you are looking for an easy music just to have fun, well then this is not for you. Personally I think this is undoubtably the best music album ever written closely followed by 'The Dark Side of the Moon'.
0767903854|5.0|The best thing about Mr. Bryson's stories are the voice in which he tells them.  He is witty, a good researcher, and a lover of travel.  Which is why most readers who loved his 'A Walk In The Woods&quot; book, will love this one as well.<br />The book takes you through Mr. Bryson's journey(s) through Australia (as if you couldn't tell that from the cover).  His description of the country in phenomenal.  Obviously, Sydney and Perth are cities to be visited should I ever choose to go to the 'land down under.'  They are beautiful and unique in their own special ways and this author helps us see them (from multiple standpoints: agricultural, wilderness settings, political, and population).<br />Traveling through the outback seemed a bit dangerous to me.  When Mr. Bryson set out in his four wheel drive (which he explains the function of in hilarious detail), it seems a bit foolish.  But the hijinks are well deserved as the travel continues.<br />Of course swimming takes a certain amount of skill, and bravery, in Australia.  The box jellyfish sounds like a small monster and the number of shark attacks are disquieting to say the least.  Mr. Bryson's experience with boogy boarding is an absolute joy to read and I'm sure that it took him many days to recover from the wounds to his body and pride.<br />All in all, this is a very well written non-fiction novel with just the right amount of information, comedy, and caring that such a country as Australia deserves.
0440219078|4.0|Reading The Giver was a very interesting to me. At first,the thought of living in such a world of perfectness and simplicity was amazing. No worries, no tears, no broken promises, no hate, no pain. Wow, amazing. But then it seemed to be unbalanced because there was no love, no pleasure, no happiness. This is when the story gets confusing and emotions start to rise. Jonas was the main character in the story. He was to be the next upcoming Giver. This seemed to be an exciting job for Jonas. then the training began. Jonas was to be accepting the responsibility of feelings and emotions. Pain, hate, love, anger, sadness, happiness, war, joy and the ability to see colors and lie. This was all new to Jonas. He couldn't fathom how he would accept and carry the responsibility to bear all of these emotions. An incident occurs in which he sees his father murder a baby. This was apparently too much for Jonas to handle. He decides to run away from his community. This was a very dangerous decision for Jonas to make because it was illegal. There were some night watches looking out. Jonas didn't care and decided to go &quot;Elsewhere&quot;. Jonas shows bravery in his choice to leave his community which he realizes is filled with imperfection and ignorance.
B000002579|2.0|Kansas specializes in bland pop hard rock of the arena variety. If that sounds appealing to you or you love REO Speedwagon or Styx you may want this album. If you like hearing the `big' tracks on the radio, stick to a greatest hits package. Stand Out is &quot;Carry On Wayward Son'
0553573403|5.0|After reading the reviews, I picked up a copy of this book and began to read.  Four days later and many sleepless nights I have finished and stand in awe of the author.  Most epic fantasy series (for example Jordan) are so repetitive that while the story is interesting it takes forever to get to the point.  Not so with Martin.  From the very beginning you are in the action and the pacing is superb.  The writing is also exceptional for the fantasy genre.  It was a pleasure to read the descriptions of the places and people.  The characters are multi-dimensional and a fully realized &quot;otherworld&quot; is superbly created and populated.<br />I highly recommend this book to readers of the fantasy genre...Mr. Martin has taken this genre to new heights and readers will not be disappointed.  I can't wait to start the next book and only hope that the fourth book is soon published.
B000002KYR|3.0|I really don't like ZZ Top. I find their brand of hard boogie grating, but gOd knows they are huge in the Midwest. If you're from the Midwest, this is probably the album for you since it features monster hit `Legs' as well as `Sharp Dressed Man'. If you are from a more civilized local I advice you stay away.
B0000027RL|5.0|Pearl Jam's Ten is almost remarkable beyond words. It's hard to believe that this was the band's debut album, for it is such a masterful piece of rock-and-roll art. Each of Ten's 11 songs is great, quite a few, including, &quot;Alive&quot;, &quot;Black&quot;, and &quot;Release&quot;, are truly amazing. There is nothing put in to fill up space, the album just keeps moving from one amazing song to another. If I could keep one album from the '90s as THE album of the decade, this would be it. It is excellent, through and through, not too long, not too short; it is just one of those near perfect albums that come around all too rarely.
B0000524E5|3.0|Could there please be a bar like this one in my town? Great renter or &quot;Date Flick&quot;.
B0000028UK|5.0|Vs. is not quite on the same level as Ten, but it still gets 5 stars, showing just how amazing a band Pearl Jam is. Vs. is certainly different from Ten; it lacks the first album's polished sound and opts for a more raw and moody feel, and it is definitely more varied. The album roars into being with &quot;Go&quot;, a thrashing and energizing speed-rock track which gives way to the hard grunge of &quot;Animal&quot; and 10 other eclectic songs. &quot;Blood&quot; is a thrashing, punk rocker; &quot;Glorified G&quot; is groovy and satirical; &quot;Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town&quot; is a strong, touching acoustic ballad. &quot;Dissident&quot; is an emotional song and possibly the best on the album, though it has some pretty strong competition. All in all, this album further shows Pearl Jam's outstanding talent.
B00003CXE7|3.0|I noticed my Dolby Digital (or DTS) processor indicated that the subwoofer channel signal is there when I'm playing this movie, but the subwoofer is not projecting any of the low frequency rumbles at all. I tried this with DTS as well as Digital Dolby and both behaved the same way. All of my other DVDs behaved fine and subwoofer rumbled fine.<br />Anyone out there experiencing this problem with this particular DVD? Check it out, put your ear next to the sub while while they are fighting at the first few scenes. The sub is totally silent.
1853261459|5.0|When I started to read Pollyanna,I feared it would be a mushy tearjerker. It isn't.Of course it is sentimental and can reduce you to tears, but what is wrong with that. Apart from the tears there is also a grim. almost satyrical sense of humour, considerable depth and a lot of sound psychology. The portrayal of turn-of-the-century philanthropy is scathing. Pollyanna is not naive. She knows there is pain and suffering, in fact she knows all about it. She may be an angel, but she is a very shrewd angel with a real grasp of the power of her own goodness.This makes the book really funny in a way that only a really thoughtfull book can be. If you can take some Victorian semtimentalisms for granted and if you are not a cynic, you should read it, whatever your age. And if you are a cynic you may never know how much you need to read this.
B00005214X|5.0|This is an old treasure I hadn't listed to for years.  Now that I have it on CD I find myself playing it over and over.  As others have commented, this is George's best work.  Indeed, I'd say all of the songs here (excepting the new outtakes and the jams) match anything he's put on a Beatles album.  they certainly would have been worthy as Beatles songs. Unfortunately, it's probably true, as George has said, the band didn't spend has much time on his songs as they did on those of his oh-so-brilliant mates, Lennon and McCartney.  But with All Things Must Pass, considerable effort was spent on making the songs; and it shows.<br />The songs are melodious, sincere and unpretentious. There's a sense of honest expression here but, unlike with Lennon, who's honesty was sometimes bitter and sarcastic, Harrison comes across as heartfelt, human, sometimes profound.  There's an overriding religious theme to this album but it isn't overbearing nor does it interfere with the good music.  Many songs are simply words of wisdom on living, for example: &quot;The love you are blessed with/This world's waiting for/So let out your heart please, please/From behind that locked door.&quot;<br />In my book, Harrison was one of the very few rock guitarists who could play slide and play it well (D. Allman &amp; J. Walsh also come to mind); his pure slide is in abundance on this recording.  How many popular songs do you know where you can whistle or hum the lead guitar part?  &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; is indelibly ingrained in our musical consciousness.  The lead is a pretty melody played elegantly.  Other less known songs, such as &quot;I'd Have you Anytime,&quot; also have this feature.  <br />I'm not a fan of outtakes in general, asking: why weren't they included in the original?  Usually it's rather evident.  My opinion doesn't change here.  With the exception of the previously unreleased, &quot;I Live for You,&quot; the add'l alternate takes don't add anything.  But they don't need to for the original 18 songs (not counting the uninspired jams) are a pleasure to listen to time and time again.  George Harrison's songwriting really hit a peak on All Things Must Pass.  And in every other way, it's one of the finest of the Beatle solos or of all the great recordings that came out in 1970.
0060987464|5.0|I have been a fan of Manson for a while but loved him for his music.  I decided that I wanted to know the man behind the make-up and glitter. I purchased the book and started to read what I think is one of the best books I have ever read.  I saw what the haters and critics refuse to see; a person with real thoughts and beliefs just like anyone else off the street. Some of his stories can turn your stomach but most have you laughing (or maybe that's just me and I'm crazy, I don't know). Every chapter is better than the one before it.  The photos are very creative with a hint of raunch, but what else would you expect?  I carried the book around with me everywhere I went just in case I had a second to read a line here or there.  I even had a woman ask me if it was my bible, I laughed and said no its not the bible.........its better.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This is an excellent movie with great acting, a well thought out plot, and a beautiful score (Hans Zimmer &amp; Lisa Gerrard). Before I saw it, I assumed it would be just another typical 'fighting' movie, but it is actually much more in depth. I was very surprised. This is also an excellent DVD package - there's a whole separate disc just for the bonus materials, which include director commentary, deleted scenes, an interview with the composer, a photo gallery, cast member bios, etc. Considering that you can get other DVDs without any of these extra features for the same price, the $23 price tag is well worth it.

B00003CWTH|1.0|It was pure  agony watching most of this film.I dont even know  why i even finished it,other than  a glimmer of hope that there would be a  good scene.The only thing I liked was the scenes about  that streetcop's relationship.I think that the whole movie  should have been about him.Tom Cruise's character was a real odd one and I think he's  to good of an actor  to waste his talent  on a yawn fest like this one.Don't waste  one red cent  on  this movie,you will thank me later.
B000002J1F|5.0|After hearing \\"Roundabout\\" on the radio while still in elementary school, I borrowed the \\"Fragile\\" LP from my future brother-in-law, and then later bought the cassette, which I wore out, and another cassette, which I again wore out, and now I finally have the CD. After listening to this album so many times over the course of many years, I have to say this is the very best Yes album (not to knock their incomparable works like \\"Close to the Edge,\\" \\"The Yes Album,\\" or \\"Tales of Topographic Oceans\\"). Each individual track is musically powerful, and they function very well together as a whole. Anderson, Squier, Howe, Wakeman and Bruford were at the peak of their ability and talents when they released this album. \\"Fragile\\" is a very carefully crafted and compiled masterpiece, and I really don't think you necessarily have to be a Yes fan or a \\"progressive rock\\" lover to appreciate it. Also, for those who only heard of Yes in the mid-1980s (i.e. the release of 90125 and after) I highly recommend \\"Fragile\\" and other albums from this early 1970s period - it's worlds apart from Yes now and much, much better.
B00003CXE7|3.0|there are many pluses to this 2-disk set. the entire second disk is full of extras, like behind the scenes featurettes, the making of, etc. the sound is crisp as is the movie. i absolutely agree that the recreation of the Coliseum is very impressive and Ridley Scott, as he's done so often, conveys a seemless sense of style and scale. the battle sequence with the volleys of fire arrows was exceptional.<br />i agree with some of the other reviewers that if this were strictly an action flick, i would probably rate it five stars but with the stigma of a picture of the year, i find it overrated; the story is a bit abreviated and disjointed. perhaps it's nitpicking but there is a real lack of motivation in the Russell Crowe's character: why does he fight? in fact, there is more compelling reason for him NOT to go on. <br />'I will always serve Rome' -- well, not really. we're not given any vision of Rome except maybe for Marcus' but that was to give Rome back to the people. well, wasn't Commodus on his way to getting the mob to come around with the games? it is really unclear how badly Commodus would have ruled (there is no benchmark left by Marcus to judge) except for that one insensitive remark about the Greek quarters and that he brought back the games (ok, regicide/patricide is bad). wasn't Marcus worse by his conquests of 'barbarians' and taking over them?! Rome is the light? maybe but i'm sure the 'barbarians' would disagree. only the victors write histories.<br />'Let me go home' -- even more reason for him not to fight. staying alive meant being apart from his family. there is no home for him among the living. sure, revenge is an issue but was that a realistic thought in the beginning?<br />for me what kept him alive was his loyality to Marcus and his need to be able to return home. both were taken early on. he decision not to fight initially as a slave was consistent; the crowd doesn't even motivate him (killing everyone in record time and screaming 'Is this whatyou want?!' and throwing the sword away in disgust.)<br />finally, the duel at the end was trite... Maximus winning despite being injured and drugged. i have a lot of problem with this, as the feeling throughout the movie was that he will never lose a fight and therefore there was no suspense or expectation. Maximus was barely hit by Commodus despite the fact that early on we see Commodus training and being quite good. (a better executed duel was the way Rob Roy ended -- it was in doubt and he won only in a desparate manner).<br />i don't hate this film; it is a good movie but just not exceptional. the extras on the disks and the cinemtagraphy makes it worthwhile but i couldn't seriously give this five stars.
0679879269|5.0|I loved the whole trilogy! I say that the trilogy is a must-read for anyone who needs a break from the tedium of God this, and God that. The books are also great for those who are Christian, but want a taste of a world where the fundamentalists are the villians, and the liberal are the heroes. Great books, I must reiterate. The first volume is appropiate for ages 9 to adult, the second is slightly more adult, and the third is most adult, with some light sexual content, and is appropiate for about 13 and up. Great books to grow up with.
0140288503|5.0|The title of my review is no less graphic than what the reader is about to experience upon reading Bowden's book. But than again, a truly epic account of battle is never meant to be pretty. &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; is just such a book. After reading WWII Epics by Steven Ambrose, I anticipated this book to follow the same guidlines in describing battle in its truest form...that of destruction, death, helplessness and the thresholds of human spirit...<br />Bowden was able to strip battle of all the &quot;glory&quot; it is all too often associated with and instead describe the utter chaos, stench and futility behind what warefare often ends up becoming. We see a bunch of gung-ho, G.I. Joe watching teenagers (no more than in their young 20's) revel about being able to kick some &quot;Somali&quot; A$$ and &quot;jump at the chance to do battle&quot; to sadly realize only a few hours later in the thick of battle with their own comrades being dismembered, disembowled and killed all around them...that instead of wanting to &quot;Wax&quot; as many rebels as possible, they want their mothers...<br />Still, what I found most rivetting about Bowden's book was the reocurring theme of &quot;lost youth&quot;...countless young soldiers who loose their lives becuse of some misguided, pretentious, glory-seeking beurocrats who are out to prove they have a viable reason to send our own to face death for the sake of vindicating their own convictions....History is our benchmark....Troy, the Crusades, the 100 Years War, WWI, WWII, Vietnam and now Somalia.<br />While reiterating the courage of the American soldiers who faced overwhelming odds, he continues to point out that this calamity could have been avoided through various means...negotiations with the Somali Clans before the fighting began, more armor for the troops, better attack plans etc. etc....the list goes on...we can argue &quot;what could have been&quot;, or &quot;what should have been&quot;...but in the end, we lost 18 of our soldiers to a cause that has barely been recognized by the U.S. government. Did these soldiers die in vain?<br />Another aspect I found interesting was Bowden's testimonials from the Somalis who lost far more people in the battle (500 plus dead and thousands injured) than we Americans did. Whilst reading, we understand the mind-set of the Somali people...to them, the Americans were a bitter sweet entity. First arriving out of humanitarian reasons to feed them and end their starvation, then gradually attacking their city and shooting at their civilians..killing children, women, anyone in their way (Bowden does not hide the American soldiers contempt of Somali lives at certain points...but than again, in the heat of battle, military codes of conduct are often overlooked). In the end, we realize the battle in Mogadishu was a &quot;lose-lose&quot; situation for both the Somalis and the Americans. The Somalis are still starving and locked in a bitter, bloody feud with warring clans. The Americans on the flip-side fought a battle that is barely recognized by the world more less the American people.<br />I highly recomend this book to anyone interested in the plain and simple horror of warfare and the death and carnage in brings with it. Bowden has done an excellent job in putting the reader in the city with the trapped American soldiers and having us face the same trial and tribulations they encountered in those few short hours...enough hours to last us a lifetime.
0385334206|4.0|This stands as a classic in contemporary American Fiction. Although I have enjoyed other Vonnegut novels more, none are more cynnical than the timeless BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS. Vonnegut narrates the tale of Dwayne Hoover and Kilgore Trout, two strangers whos paths would cross with devastating consequences. Hoover is a wealthy owner of several business including a car dealership, he is also slowly going mad. Kilogre Trout is a novelist with underappreciated talent.  His works only seem to be  published in porno rags.  While the story of their catastrophic encounter is humurous it serves mainly as a backdrop for Vonnegut's social criticism.<br />Vonnegut uses BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS to not only ridicule obvious  social issues (i.e. racism and pollution to name but a few), He also jabs at those establishments that most Americans would hold sacred. He mocks the founding fathers, explicitly chastising Thomas Jefferson as a man who wrote of the value of freedom while at the same time owning hundreds of slaves.  He christens the military academies as institutions whos sole purpouse is to train mindless homicidal maniacs.  As poignant as his finger pointing is, it remains evident that Vonnegut's purpouse is to educate and not to instigate.<br />Having been written over a quarter of a century ago, it is amazing that BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS remains as relevant and enthralling as it was when first published.  Read this book with an open mind and you will enjoy it. You need not agree with Vonnegut to appreciate his flair.
B000002VSN|5.0|Whitney Houston went back to her roots with this soundtrack, where she started her career, which was singing gospel music. That remarkable voice has never been so strong and focused on its material. The music is featured in the 1996 motion picture The Preachers Wife, in which Whitney starred in alongside Denzel Washington.<br />Most of the songs made an appearance in the movie, from stirring gospel music like Joy, Hold On Help Is On The Way, I Go To The Rock, I Love The Lord, Who Would Imagine A King, Joy To The World and more. There is also some new music from Whitney, which is more radio friendly. I Believe In You And Me appears on the soundtrack in both original version and single version, the original being more traditional in ballad form and the single version a little more radio friendly. Step By Step is also included twice, the original and a remix version. My Heart is Calling is another nice addition, but my favorite has to be You Were Loved, in my opinion one of the best Whitney Houston songs ever, its definately my favorite. This is something to check out for sure.<br />This is a really nice soundtrack if you really liked the movie, or like this type of music. What prompted me to buy this was the fact that it was Whitney, but after seeing the movie, the music put me in such a good frame of mind that I knew I had to have it, this music is special and makes you happy. I highly reccomend it to everyone.
B0000542DJ|5.0|All those op ed writers (George Will; Tom Wicker; Alexander Cockburn et al) who raked Oliver Stone over the coals in 1991 for &quot;JFK's&quot; historical inaccuracies completely missed the point.<br />&quot;JFK&quot; is a motion picture presentation of how many America FEEL about November 22, 1963....they FEEL that something much darker,ominous  and profound happened that day in Dallas than just a man in a window shooting at a man in a car and this FEELING is what Oliver Stone's movie is all about.<br />Even those of us who tend to discount Stone's conspriacy theory and believe Oswald acted alone have to acknowlegde the film's power and sheer technical cinematic brilliance.<br />For years the events in Dealey Plaza cried out for a movie....it was Oliver Stone who had both the courage and the clout to take it on.<br />This new DVD edition is simply stunning: containing 17 minutes of footage not included in the theatrical release; fascinating commentary by Stone himself; almost an hour's worth of deleted/extended scenes;an update on recently released assassination files and an interview with Fletcher Prouty (upon whom Stone based the character of 'X.'<br />To hell with historical accuracy...leave that to the History Channel...Stone turned the assassination of JFK into a beautifully produced and edited political thriler and this new DVD edition with all the special features gives it a whole new life.
B000051VWW|5.0|So full of caring and human depth is this gorgeous album.  The world needs to fall into the perfection of such a stunning musical vibration.  We are all in need of such a profound gift as this soul work.  I am not surprised that this disc is most popular now in San Francisco.  Wake up all.  Sade's lyrics are as whole as her composition.
B00004XQ83|5.0|O Brother Where Art Thou takes me to a place that I've never been before, even musically. I'm brazilian, my musical roots are samba, bossa-nova, maracatu and others but I'm impressed with these old american classics from a distant time.  Beautiful music, gorgeous interpretations and the Coen Bros. personal touch make this albun one of the bests of the year and I'm really sorry about the brazilians whose never will hear it. We just have to buy the imports but the effort is almost a duty for music lovers.
B00000BKDX|5.0|Of the 15 or so live albums I own, Live After Death stands alone at the top.  Awesome energy, great song selection, and all-around sterling production.  Highlights are too many to mention, though the crowd screaming on &quot;Hallowed Be Thy Name&quot; still gives me chills.  This was Maiden on top of their game, when they were the biggest metal band on Earth (Sorry, Priest fans).  <br />As many fans know, the band went slightly more progressive after this, and later stagnated to the point of being more or less inconsequential, losing Adrian Smith and Bruce Dickinson along the way.  As a general metal fan, though, this album qualifies as a  landmark in the genre's development.
B00005A0N5|5.0|I've got 3 of their albums as TERRIFIC KOREAN BONUS TRACK RELEASE, and I think this [Oceanborn] is the best album from them. Cool guitar, cool female operatic vocal, and it's real heavy metal!!! Must have for metalheads like me!!!
B000003TAL|5.0|I love listening to a wide range of different music from rock to hip-hop, Jazz to Punk and many more. I own a couple really great albums, but I'll just talk about the one at the moment that is inspiring me the most, it is Daydream Nation By Sonic Youth. It's quite an old album it was recorded in 1988 and was huge inspiration for many of rocks biggest bands such as Nirvana; it also foretold the grunge movement in the early 90s.<br />   Sonic Youth formed around about 1981 in New York, the band consists of Thurston Moore, (vocal, guitar) Lee Ranaldo, (vocal, guitar) Kim Gordon, (vocal, bass) and Steve Shelly (drums). They were a product of New York's experimental `No-Wave' scene that did not follow the trends or conventional rules of music, their oddly tuned guitars and sudden breaks into distortion and noise   mid-point into song is what makes them Sonic Youth.<br />   Sonic Youth have become one of the most well known underground bands, but have little or no air play and have only enjoyed small spread success, but that's the way they like it.<br />   I like this album because it has a different sound to most pop rock music, I like the way they tune their guitars to very strange tunings, their use of feedback and noise from the guitars and long periods of instrumentation in between vocals, but you really have to listen to this album to really know what's it's like, you have to experience it.  My favorite songs from the album are `Teen Age Riot', `Total Trash', `Silver Rocket', `Hey Joni' and `Cross the breeze'.<br />     In 1990 Sonic Youth left the independent circuit to sign to new label Geffen Records, going on to establish a reputation as the grandparents to the alternative US rock scene with powerful albums such as Goo and Dirty.
0385484518|4.0|Having said goodbye to his beloved professor, Morrie Schwartz, Mitch Albom headed off to the big city of New York.  Mitch took the first job offered as a sports writer and dove into his work without ceasing.  He traveled all over the country writing about other peoples' dreams while ignoring his own.  As he was skimming through channels late one night, Mitch happened to stumble upon a story of a dying man guiding the world through his philosophies.  Mitch's old professor, Morrie, had developed ALS, or Lou Gherig's didease.  But it was Morrie's bare attitude about death a nd his emotional confidence that drew the television commentator, Ted Koppel, towards this wonderous man.  To Morrie &quot;Dying is only one thing to be sad over,....Living unhappiliy is something else.&quot;  Mitch began weekly journeys to Morrie's and began his final class with his professor.  Morrie forced Mitch to contemplate the bigger questions in life.  He made him realize that although his life was full of activity, he was always unsatisfied.  Morrie expressed his feelings on the priciple topics in life; death, fear, aging, family, society, and a meaningful life, these are some ot the themes he deemed necessary for existance.  Mitch prompted Morrie about any regrets he had, and Morrie voiced that our culture does't encourage us to think about death until it is our last day.  Morrie explains how we are so wrapped up with egotistical things; career, family money, nad paying the mortgage that we involve ourselves with these axts to keep us from looking back at our lives and pondering.  He shows the world how beautiful a person can be for simply being human.  All during the expressive sessions with Morrie and Mitch, Morrie is slowly deteiriorating.  Although his body was decaying, his ming was ever increasing and he felt that when it came to aging he embraced it.  He explains that as you age you learn more.  Aging is not just decomposing, its growth.  Its the understanding that you are going todie that will enrich your life.  As Morrie's body was crippling, Mitch reveals a sensitive side to him that longs for touch and sympathy.  They begin to hold hands, hug upon arrival, and an occaional shedding of tears.  Affection was a critical point in the deep connection that the two shared.  On the last Tuesday, Morrie could only speak in spurts and his voice was raspy. Each breath he took was a struggle.  He knew that Morrie was within his final days.  Mitch held his old professor's hand and MOrrie told him that if he were to have another son, he would have wanted it to be Mitch, and that Mitch had touched him deep within his heart.  Mitch confessed his love for Morrie and with a quit strength, Morrie professed he knew he always had.
B000001FXX|5.0|I'll go song by song to give you a full picture of this album. 1. Lively Up Yourself--one of Marley's best, most groovy songs. When the brass comes in at around minute 3, forget it. Just too good. 2. No Woman, No Cry--this is an unfortunate version of a great song. The music sounds computer-generated and bizarre. Much better version on &quot;Live&quot; 3. Them Belly Full--I love it-the beat is fantastic and the lyrics are top-notch. 4. Rebel Music--has a blues-y kind of feel. Great driving music. 5. So Jah Seh--the brass is perfect in this one. 6. Natty Dread--&quot;Dreadlock congo bongo I!&quot;--don't quite know what this means, but the way Bob sings it is amazing. 7. Bend Down Low--sounds like a little kid toy song. I always skip this one. 8. Talkin' Blues--nice slow, mellow tune. 9. Revolution--great closing track. Makes sure we understand Bob's cause and fight for freedom. Well, that's the whole album! The only complaint I have is that it's too short, but that concern just further shows how great the album is--it always leaves you wanting more! Buy it now!
6301797906|3.0|This movie, starring Henry Fonda as Tom Joad, is based on the novel written by John Steinbeck.  It follows the lives of the Joad family, one of hundreds of Oklahoma families that were thrown off their land during the Dust Bowl of the 1930's.  The family joins thousands of other families from around the country on the long journey to California.  Everyone is headed to California because of the promise of work.  The Joads begin their long journey in a single truck that holds all of their possessions, 12 family members and their friend Casey, a former preacher.  Their journey is met with one hardship after another, even after they have entered the \\"promised land\\" of California. The theme of the movie is suffrage.  No matter what jobs the Joads get, or where they end up living, something always happens that makes their lives harder to bare.  All of the employers in California promise one thing and deliver something of much lesser value.  For example:  they say that they will pay 5 cents for a bucket of peaches, and the next day, the employers lower the price to 2.5 cents.  The Joads never knew what was really going to happen, and as Ma Joad put it, the family \\"Got nothing to trust\\".   The movie follows the book fairly closely, but it leaves out many valuable parts.  The movie also ends much sooner than the book.  For those people who have read the book, this movie will probably be a disappointment, especially if they are expecting the movie to follow the book exactly.  The movie was made in the 40's, so it was black and white.  Because of this, this movie will not appeal to those who like fast paced movies with lots of special effects.  However for those who like old movies,  The Grapes of Wrath is a great choice.
B000050XEI|5.0|All human beings suffer.<br />We suffer at different rates. In between moments of suffering there are moments of intense enlightenment, introspection, self-awareness, joy.<br />These are the very moments Enya captures in &quot;A Day Without Rain.&quot;<br />I am not an Enya fan. Never heard of her before the song &quot;Only Time&quot; haunted my life three times in one week. First, I heard her song in a movie preview while waiting to watch &quot;Hanibal&quot; (great soundtrack by the way). Later in the same week I fell asleep with the TV on. I woke thinking for a moment that I had died and crossed over. I heard this angelic music, a prayer in musical form filling the night. It was Enya performing on Leno. Finally in the same week, I watched &quot;Providence&quot; with my wife. This particular show really touched me. Then this same song began invading my soul. The show ended with a powerful intertwining of &quot;Only Time&quot; with the show's suffering characters.<br />The entire CD is a prayer, a Psalm, a hymn. You can't listen to this CD without changing. Enya invades your heart, soul, and mind. She encourages you to believe that you're not just the chance explosion of thinking cells. You are a spiritual being with a hold on eternity. You are forever.<br />I encourage you to listen, learn, grow, love.<br />Love and good journey,<br />Kevin
0553106635|5.0|OK.  Look at all the reviews and they are all 4 or 5 stars.(almost).  We are not kidding.  These books are really great. I've read a lot of fantasy and these books are by far my favorite.  I love all the characters, good and bad. I love the world and feel a part of it. These books become a part of you and the charaters as well. I never cried like a lot of the other reviewers, but I might have come close a time or two. Wait...I did cry once. It was when I was finished. I didn't want it to end. I want the next one now. This book really is superb. Better than Lord of Rings to me, and Wheel of Time put together.  Buy these books now or wait for all of them to come out. Just buy them. You won't be disappointed.(far from it,really)
0738203335|4.0|As someone who has been tracking the progress of Linux since 1992, and has been using it continuously since 1994, I have been looking for some years now - at least since 1998, when Linux hit the mainstream news - who is going be the first to come up with a history of Linux; something among similar lines as Gleick did for chaos theory. Now we have the winner: Glyn Moody, a British IT journalist.<br />Not always organized in a chronological order, Rebel Code follows the progress of Linux and several other open-source projects (XFree86, Sendmail, Perl, Apache, Samba...) from the grandfather of Linux, Unix, in late sixties; then we follow the stories of Andrew Tannenbaum's Minix system and Richard Stallman's project GNU through the eighties, until we finally arrive to the beginnings of Linux in 1991. From then on, we follow it rise and blossom, with its added functionalities, with the first contributors to the kernel starting to appear, and then the first Linux distributions.<br />If the first half of the book deals mostly with technical topics, the second half - following the decision of Netscape Corporation to open the source code of their Web browser - is mostly concerned with the socio-economical issues of the open source model, the differences between it and the idea of free software; the huge initial success of the IPOs of open-source companies (Moody is much less vocal about the fact that they lost most of their values a year later), possible alternative uses of Linux (handheld and internet appliances) and musings on the possible future of the free/open source movement.<br />Speaking of the latter, I miss a more thorough and independent analysis on whether the author sees the free/open source development model as a sustainable strategy or just a part of the dotcom craze. In that aspect, Rebel Code doesn't bring much one would not already know from the writing of Larry McVoy and Eric Raymond. I may not be alone here. Anybody who has already been tracking the progess of Linux - and I believe the majority of readership ought to be sought in this audience - will probably find some 80% of the book already familiar. The rest present the interviews the author conducted with some principal contributors throughout the 2000, and contained many new and interesting facts to me. The whole is packaged in a fairly pleasant and readable form.<br />There is something about Moody that makes me uneasy, though. I cannot quite decide whether it is his intellectual criticism, or is he simply looking for some cheap drama. His best known writing on Linux before this book was his 1997 HotWired article titled &quot;The Greatest OS That (N)ever Was&quot; where he depicts his worrisome views about the future of Linux in dramatic tones (&quot;...But Linux also sits at a critical juncture...&quot;). In Rebel Code, he seems to be especially proud of his description of the schism that was threatening in Linux development in 1998, which &quot;... nobody outside the Linux world noticed.&quot;<br />Finally, there is no apologize for the complete omission of references. Linux is a child of Internet, its development was carried out in the open, and so it is perhaps the best documented OS ever. This book had a wonderful chance to become the authoritative list of resources concerning the Linux history, and flunked it. On the positive side, Rebel Code does have a decent index.
B000003S0P|5.0|Red - 30th anniversary edition. Not that many records have the potential to affect you this deeply and even less can do it this quickly. There are no extracts from this disk as it's the perfect example that &quot;the whole is greater than the sum of its parts&quot;. Just be warned that you may not return from the trip in exactly the same place you left from.
0694524743|5.0|We all know this story, and how exciting and stirring it is. But hearing this dramatic and well-produced reading adds a wholly new dimension to the overall experience. The inspired choice of Michael York allows the story to unfold before your very eyes, as he paces his voice comfortably enough to make you follow along and be excited at the same time. The reading may take a long time, but York never sinks into a monotonous tone, and he also gives each character personality and depth. Particularly tellig is his satanic characterisation of the White Witch. He also avoids the tendency to make the children sound too cue or whiney. To sum everything up, this reading will be sure to capture the hearts and imaginations of anyone who listens to it, and will surely be prized highly in any Narnia lover's collection and also by those who have never heard of the Narnia stories.
0767840135|4.0|I was spell-bound watching this for the first time.  Although there are some not-so-exciting as other sections, the majority of the acts are unbelievable.  What a grand mix of physical beauty, strength, flexibility and art! The best has to be a toss-up between the &quot;scarf dance&quot; by the solo acrobat and the couple doing the most amazing lift moves.  The musical background is so well written in that it matches the visual routines.  <br />If you want visual stimulation with an appreciation for the fine arts, then this is a MUST!  Having a history in gymnastics and music performance, I never tire from seeing this DVD over and over again and again.
014028009X|5.0|Fast read. I couldn't wait to see what crazy shinanigan would happen next.
B00004Y2QS|3.0|To the facts:<br />Low factors:<br />The drummer. In the 90s, Prince had a talented drummer on board by the name of Michael Bland. If you ever had a chance to listen to a bootleg copy of \\" She's Always in My Hair\\" from the Act 2 Tours of 1993, compare it to the one on Rave DVD. Michael Bland's drumming was tight, detailed and innovative...there was incredible coordination and unity with the bass and other progressions through a song. A lot of this attention to detail was missing on the Rave DVD, due to the mediocre drumming of Kirky J. I think that he is the weakest drummer the purple one has ever enlisted. His delivery is dry and very basic...like something from a manual. Not the type of innovative beats delivered by Bland.<br />Larry Graham is a lively old man, with effective bass part, but give him a singing part and you have material to skip pass...this slowed down the momentum of the concert for me in a big way.<br />1999...I've heard better renditions of this song on live bootleg recordings. It was a basic funky delivery, more of a James Brown meets Las Vegas style than a wicked new version. Lacked any element of surprise. It even seemed to drag in places, and seemed to have more to do with balloons and confetti falling than serious music.  More fun to look at that listen_ though the scatter-brain-editing could easily give you a headache.  <br />Prince could've performed other songs. \\"Raspberry Beret\\" and \\"Take me with you\\" had that stinky Las Vegas nostalgia delivery, once again. \\" Baby Knows\\" sounded suprisingly the same as on the CD_ a lil flat. Substitute with tracks like (maybe)strolling, sshhh, scandalous, or even something cool like Crucuial ( which fans have never heard a live version of) would have made this concert a real treat! I even wish he would have openend the concert with a live \\" Rave unto the Joy Fantastic,\\" as the DVD is titled off of. I personally wish he did more sexy jams_ \\"Do Me Baby,\\" \\"Insatiable,\\" heck even \\"Sun Moon and Star\\" would have been super cool_ and a little less of Larry. This concert to me is less of Prince-taking-risks.  I wonder if we'll ever see that Prince again?<br />Highlights:<br />The concert opened with momentum. Let's get Crazy got Crazy quick and flowed nicely into a guitar-driven Always in my hair ( with bumpy, exploding bass). The purple confetti falling on the guitar solo added to the energetic introduction.<br />The Hornz were delicious.  It's nice to see and hear a woman on sax. Prince is good at recruiting talented female musicians.<br />Prince is a great guitarist! I replayed the Blues Guitar solo maybe about 17 times already! It's just amazing! That section alone could justify purchasing this DVD for me! Great part of the show.<br />Kravitz section was cool. It was nice to see them both on stage. Prince added slammin guitar! The two songs sound a lot better on this DVD than they do on Lenny's CDs. I wonder Why...<br />Greatest Romance with the music video intro was cool. That was an unexpected surprise( breaking the live footage) and the live version that completed the song sounded sexy! <br />The version of Purple Rain was absolutely beautiful, and the Christ was just superb ( love the gospel chior addition...added an interesting new layer to the song). <br />The Modern Dancers were fun. I especially enjoyed the female dancer in \\" She's Always in My Hair\\" Very subtle and original movements! Nice moves again on Purple Rain intro.  <br />It's an enjoyable concert. Prince is big fun to look at, and he's can be a hypnotic live presence. As far as live performers go, he's one of the maestros...but still, that doen't mean he can do anything and it'll be great. Rave is a very entertaining DVD that could have been better! However, when it's good , it really shine, and I'd buy it again for those shining moments.
0738203335|5.0|Glyn Moody does an excellent job on showing how the Linux kernel came about as a culminating event of work started years before by other hackers. It explains how, from a humble bedroom and a 386, came the missing piece of the free software movement.<br />The book shows how the free software movement and GNU/Linux are bringing computing back to a state where the users have control over what they are running, after 20 years of proprietary software ruling.<br />I recommend this book for those interested in computing. Every professional would benefit from its reading.
0393312836|5.0|A Clockwork Orange is a conceptually simple but potent allegory bringing up questions of free will and the nature of good and evil. Two things about the book may be stumbling-blocks to some readers: its extensive use of invented slang (based mostly on Russian), and the violent content necessary to portray Alex's depravity. The former actually tends to suppress the latter. Philosophically ACO seems to be a parable praising free will, but the book raises more questions than it answers. So do many great books. This edition fortunately includes the controversial last chapter, which I agree with the author is essential to the work. But whether this is really so, along with the social lessons to be gleaned by this effective story, is for the individual reader to decide. After all, as Burgess said, &quot;you are free&quot;.
B000002J03|5.0|Led Zeppelin II is often cited as the definitive hard rock album, and it is true than within its nine tracks one can discern the origins of all sorts of sacred metal traditions: the sexual frenzy ('Whole Lotta Love'), mystical fantasies ('Ramble On'), breathtaking guitar solos ('Heartbreaker') and just plain heavy riffing all through. This effort actually does feel a bit truncated in comparison to their first album, which sprawled out a bit more. Here they've managed to cut some more succinct, yet just as seminal slices of hard rock. In typical Zeppelin fashion, there is an emphasis on subtlety (such as the jazzy verses on 'What Is and What Should Never Be') as well as on bombast and volume. But probably the main thing that most listeners will remember here is the sheer energy. Highly recommended.
B00004YRQA|5.0|This is one of the most important things for a system. If you don't have one you can't save games. And if you can't save games you'll have to start over from the begining each time! So when your getting your system make sure you get the memory card. It's very important. If you don't, your missing out A LOT!
B000002J1U|5.0|Zeppelin's reputation so far had been built mainly on thunderous heavy rock, so a more laid-back, mellow record such as this was probably bound to receive criticism. The actual songs, however, are close to the level of the first two albums and prove very enjoyable once one gets past the shock of hearing acoustic guitars all the time. Two standouts here are 'Friends', a melodic, droning Celtic piece, and 'Tangerine' a lovely bit of country-folk. Metalheads must listen to 'Immigrant Song' while those who prefer blues should enjoy 'Since I've Been Loving You'. There's no need to quibble with a stompin' good folk song like 'Gallows Pole' either. The only disappointing track here is the closer, the brief and strange 'Hats Off to Roy Harper'. Just a minor flaw. This is an essential CD for a Zep collection.
B00004XQ83|5.0|So I didn't really like this movie (more on that when it comes out on video, I guess), but there were a few moments during it when a song started playing and I was just transported.  Many, many times through the soundtrack later, I can say that it doesn't wear off.  <br />Soundtrack albums often have one really good song on them but are otherwise disappointing.  That's not true here; my feelings about these songs range from like to ecstatic love.  I have about six favorites -- &quot;Down to the River to Pray&quot; &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; &quot;Didn't Leave Nobody But the Baby&quot; &quot;I&quot;ll Fly Away&quot; &quot;I Am Weary (Let Me Rest) &quot;Angel Band&quot; and &quot;O Death&quot; spring to mind, except, oops, that's seven.  The musicians and song styles are diverse, but the quality is consistent.
0871137380|5.0|Blackhawk Down is one of my all-time favorite books.  I haverecommended this book to many people, from friends who are intomilitary history to people who have never had an interest in readingmilitary history books (like my sister who reads &quot;... bookclub&quot; books).  Everyone I have recommended this book to ravedabout it.  Even if you are not a military history buff, you can't helpbut be moved by what these guys go through.  Bowden does a fantasticjob in conveying the tension, frustration, sadness, anger, and tragedyon both the US and the Somali side (more so on the US side).  I haveread a few military books including Charles Beckwith's Delta Force,Andy McNab's Bravo Two Zero and Immediate Action, Marcinko's RogueWarrior, and others (no, I don't limit my reading to military historybooks).  There is no comparison.  This is one of the most engagingbooks I have read, and I finished this book in almost one sitting...Ihad to sleep at 7:30am after staying up all night reading (I'm a slowreader).  Buy this book, especially since it is out in paperback now.I bought the hardcopy and I'm glad I did because I have let manyfriends borrow this book and this is one book I will re-read manytimes.  Just make sure you start reading this book when you dont haveto wake up early the next morning because you won't want to put thisbook down once you start reading it.
076790382X|4.0|So I was reading this book late at night and wound up doubled over with my face in a pillow so I wouldn't wake up the person across the hall with my laughing.  <br />This book is insightful (I'm sure I learned things about being American, despite being American), funny, and well-written.  The one minus, for me, is that the way he talks about his wife eventually got on my nerves.  She comes off as a bit of a 50s-tv-show mom, by turns irrational in her femininity and annoyingly wise.  That he refers to her as &quot;Mrs. Bryson&quot; doesn't help matters.  But that's minor, and maybe if you didn't read it all in one night as I did, it would be less evident.  Mostly, this is just a wicked funny book.
B000053GTF|5.0|This collection of Celine Dion's music videos are priceless gems that are to be seen over and over again! My Heart Will Go On is, ultimately, her greatest song ever....the music video adds even more magic to the song as we see scenes from the 1997 blockbuster film: TITANIC (the greatest film of all time) mixed in with a stunning visual of Celine standing at the bow of the legendary ship....wind blowing through her beautiful long hair, and singing with intense emotion - the song that made the world listen. Awesome!!!!...
0671034065|4.0|This was a good story. For me, different than what I normally read. The characters were very well written. The intense relationship between Jaine and Sam was awesome. Being a woman myself, I know some of the topic's a group of girl's can get on. I loved &quot;The List&quot; these four friends came up with. It happens all the time when you have a group of out spoken girls discussing their relationships and sex lives. This novel added a twisted plot of their conversations, that turned a work environment upside down and made national news, all because 4 ladies decide what their version of Mr. Perfect would be, I loved it. I have to admit, the killer in this story really surprised me. I think Linda Howard did a great job on this one. This novel will keep you turning the pages, and you will never suspect the true killer until the end. Hold onto your seat as you twist and turn with this one, especially with Jaine and Sam. I absoulutely loved Jaine Bright's character.
