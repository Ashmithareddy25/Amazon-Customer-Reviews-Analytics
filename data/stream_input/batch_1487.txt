B006G2ZEV6|5.0|first of all, this game NEVER force closes on my Kindle.<br />second the graphics really shine. third the game starts off easy but gradually becomes quite challenging. the 2 survival modes are too similar to each other to offer much replayability. if you like traditional tower defends games then you will love this version where you get to attack the towers. well done... wishing for a sequel.
B005CRQ4XI|3.0|If I had known that every few pages I would have to see passages underlined by Oprah  I would not have bought this edition. Not only does it bump me out of the narrative, but it deprives me of experiencing the book on my own; instead forcing me to think Oprah's underlines are the important parts. It makes what could otherwise be a beautiful story feel like a cheap used textbook. I should at least be able to hide the obnoxious underlining and get to experience the story on my own.<br /><br />I love the story, and I love Oprah, but I hate having her perspective forced on me as I read. I'll never buy an Oprah digital book again.

B000SLP4SE|2.0|WOW GI JOE TRIUMPHS AGAIN GOSH!!! Sound track was terrible but it matched the inanity of the film. I know, i know i shouldn't complain -  I watched it almost free. Thank goodness.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game I have a highscore of 33333333 so Yahoo its so freaking awesome I have been waiting ever science my tutor had it on her ipad am I right or am I right?!
B007ZKY7XO|3.0|If I had not seen the CD cover and someone played this for me, I would have been about 92 percent certain that I was listening to a \\"Flight of the Conchords\\" soundtrack.  The songs are clever and pithy but lack any substance or memorability - good for a couple listens and a chuckle, but not something I will listen to on a regular basis.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is such an amazing game I bribe my brother with it if he grabs my blanket and stuff he can play 2 rounds proofe of how good it is.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game I have it on my iPod and my Kindle. My dad even got hooked on it. It is a great game. You should totally get this game if you don't have it!!!!!!
B003Z9Q4WG|5.0|I never realized how much I missed the vinyl I discarded in the 80's, now I know.<br />The Nielsen 3rd, Mahler 7th, Franck opened my mind beyond Beethoven, Mozart and the standards I had been listening to for years. The memories of those exact peformances returning were worth the price for the lot. The rest is bonus. I do wish they had stretched the point and included Harold in Italy, however.<br /><br />CUSSED CARDBOARD SLEEVES: Getting past the huge square box with four stacks of sleeves which must be retrieved from four bins, the sleeves are a pain.<br /> The tolerence and fit on my batch varies. Many are the tightest fit of any box collection I have. HINT FOR HANDLING.  I think it will help you to have a clean, soft cotton cloth handy. Flex the sleeve and grip the disc with your thumb and finger on the cloth. While you keep the sleeve flexed open, gently pull the disc out. Voila. No fingerprint, no smudge, no damage to the disc. After playing you may or may not need the cloth. It is much simpler to replace the disc than to extract it.<br /><br />Enjoy the music that much more now that you can handle the discs without smudge. Enjoy.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|John Carter was a great movie that did not deserve the negative press it received when it was released in theatres.  Got the 3-D version and watched it tonight.  The movie had a great story, sound character development, interesting plot, and tied things together with the book it was based on.  It was consistently thrilling to watch.  The action did not let up the entire two hours and kept a steady pace even during the \\"slow\\" scenes.  The only complaint is that the time went by too fast.  I would definitely recommend this one.
B0086700CM|5.0|best game ever in the world I wish the game was real so I can run away from the monkey.

1401937268|5.0|I recently received the Angel Tarot Deck and  I love them, they are beautiful, with very positive and high vibrational pictures, words and meanings.<br />The traditional tarot card has some \\"fear based\\" words / images on them such as \\"death\\" and \\"devil\\" ,which to experienced psychics don't necessary create fear because their meanings are symbolic but they can create a negative vibe around tarot readings, and can also create fear for the clients. It is nice to see a positive loving word instead of a negative one.<br /> These are lovely to work with and easy to use, a great way for beginners to become familiar with angels, tarot and oracle cards, meanings are written on the cards themselves with a longer explanation in the little book.<br /><br />Doreen and Radleigh have stuck to the traditional major and minor arcana but have just used positive and healing words as well as additional loving meanings and insights within the book and on the cards. For instance the Card \\"Ego\\" has replaced the \\"devil\\" card. Each Major arcana card is also aligned with an archangel giving it a further dimension and level of spirituality and meaning.<br /> I am a professional angel psychic and use cards every day in my business and personal life. These cards add an extra dimension to the readings, not only are they highly accurate, and very stunning, there are hidden meanings in the pictures and they seem to come alive in a reading!<br />I have always loved and used Doreen virtue's other 44/ 45 card angel decks and these are just as wonderful and compliment the other decks. They are different from the other decks because there are more of them and they have many subtle and direct meanings, they have the same artist's work through out the deck, they are tarot cards essentially but aligned with the angels- just what I was wishing for and a perfect tool for my business and personal life!<br />thanks to the authors designers, and artist for the angel tarot!<br />I definitely recommend them!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The games are pretty fun. I like the fact that there is so much variety in the games. My favorite is curling, although I am terrible at it xD
B0086700CM|5.0|I have this game on my ipod and I have been waiting for the kindle to get it and they finaly did!!! I am so excited I play it every day!!! everyone should get it!!!!!!!!!!
B0086700CM|4.0|good game but you're a little late.....everyone said it was a good game so I got it and I agree with them but if it would have been availible for the kindle fire a little sooner it would have had a 5 star review
0439023513|2.0|Read the first two books, then skip this one. Make up your own ending unless you like major downers and depression. The first two books were so uplifting and cool. I have no idea why the author decided to make this into such a terrible ending for what was, until the last 1/3 or so, an excellent series.
B007DIQB50|5.0|love it. its a very great cd to listen to. good artist. love rhe differant type of music. rap and pop. nicki minaj is vey talented person.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|The finale is almost twice as long as the others in the series and I was just itching to finish it to answer all of the series' mysteries!  It unravels more towards the end of the book with a good build up.<br /><br />The beginning started out with Mac feeling like it's the end of the world after the cliff hanger ending of Book 4.  And you finally get the clear, no denial, no self-deception view of her feelings for my favourite character.  It's an emotional roller coaster for Mac and the reader.<br /><br />This finale does answer pretty much all the questions raised, except one of the major ones is only partly revealed but as Mac decides, she doesn't really need to know or care to know.<br /><br />There were several false climaxes going towards the final show down.  And I was not expecting the main villain that was finally revealed.  There are several revelations here that took me by surprise.<br /><br />This final book had more romantic elements to it than the other books in the series, and explores Mac's relationship and feelings towards the person that she finally realises and admits she can't live without.  I love the interactions between them and the distinction between the thorough examination of Mac's thoughts/feelings towards this person and the lack of the same from that person (seeing how this is a first person book).  All the same, the subtleties from her observations and spoken/unspoken dialogue with that person creates a deep impact.<br /><br />Really enjoyed this series.  Though truthfully, I am a romance bug, so I'm not sure how much I would have enjoyed this if it wasn't for that element in the series.  Though it's not the main focus, the pivotal player plays a vital role in Mac's growth, while at the same time keeping her grounded to what's important.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|such a fun game. I recommend ppl to play it'll keep you up all night playing! I do thing this is a hard game for toddlers to play:(
B003ITZBVI|5.0|...I just HAVE to write a review about this movie as it is one of the best I have seen in a long time...heck, one of the best movies I've seen, ever.    BACKGROUND--Major Spoilers ahead    I have always enjoyed comic books, the toys that come with them, posters, etc. However, I have never been too big a fan of the cartoons...just never really got into them as I thought (for example) the old 'Superfriends' were silly with the Wonder Twins and their pet monkey, Gleek, ridiculous plot lines, and such like.    'Red Hood,' however, caught my attention as many friends recommended it to me...but mainly that I know 'Red Hood' is the original alias of the Joker.    The name of the movie just sounded ...cool...so I gave it a look.    I. Was. Blown. Away. I had hopes, somewhat high ones, going into this that I would enjoy this cartoon, but I had no idea how much I would enjoy it. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen, period.    There were no pet monkeys in this cartoon, by the way.    WHERE TO BEGIN?    Let's start with the voice cast: I understand most Batman fans were disappointed that the long-time voices of The Batman and The Joker: Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill, respectively, were absent from this film, but I thought their replacements: Bruce Greenwood and John DiMaggio, did a great job. I've always liked Greenwood since seeing his portrayal of President Kennedy in 'Thirteen Days,' and I thought his Batman was spot-on, at least in my mind, of what the character should sound like.    DiMaggio was a good Joker...more Jack Nicholson than Heath Ledger, but Mr. Ledger's performance will never be duplicated so why even bother to try?    Neil Patrick Harris is great as Nightwing (Dick Grayson, the original Robin) as he brought humor to an otherwise very dark movie. However, he didn't have a lot of on-screen time, which is one of the few complaints I have with this film.    Wade Williams is Black Mask, the gang leader who is at war with The Red Hood. Over-the-top and quite funny (think the 1960s TV show), I enjoyed his performance.    Jason Isaacs is Ra's al Ghul. Isaacs gives the character a quiet dignity of a sort, mixed together with an authorative, self-righteous tone. Plus, Isaacs can do creepy quite well. Check out 'The Patriot' or 'Event Horizon' for further proof, if you need it.    Finally, Jensen Ackles is Red Hood/Jason Todd. I felt Ackles stole the show as he brought a dramatic intensity to his character that completely swept me into the story. The raw emotion he conveyed, particularly in a scene with Batman near the end of the movie...I cannot describe it, it was great. No, beyond great.    ANIMATION    I am not qualified to give technical aspects, but I thought this movie looked great. Gotham City visually looks like a mix of the Gotham City(s) from the Christian Bale and Michael Keaton movies--with a little 'Blade Runner' thrown in for good measure. The animation has an elegant flow to it...the heroes glide across the screen...and the only negatives I noticed were a couple of scenes in which characters are running and it (the running) looks kind of 'stop-motion choppy.' However, the visuals are quite stunning.    STORY    The movie opens with the Joker brutally killing Jason Todd, the second 'Robin,' as Batman arrives just seconds late to save him. The violence depicted is brutal, despite being shown off-camera, and definitely not for children.    The movie then jumps ahead five years and there is a new villain/vigilante in Gotham, killing any and all rivals who dare get in his way. He bargains with the Gotham drug dealers, telling them he'll protect them (mainly from himself) as long as he gets a huge cut--and they don't deal to children. This new villain is the Red Hood.    Of course, it is only a matter of time before he crosses paths with Batman, and if not for Nightwing showing up to help out, the Red Hood may very well have defeated Batman in their first encounter...as Red Hood departs, he yells something thatcauses Batman to take pause...playing and sound-editing back a tape of their encounter later, Batman realizes Red Hood called him, 'Bruce.'    Meanwhile, Black Mask is so frustrated with Red Hood's assault on his crime empire, he breaks the Joker out of Arkham Asylum hoping to enlist his help...which, of course, backfires. And, Batman discovers through detective work of his own that Red Hood and Jason Todd are the one and same...he then travels to Ra's al Ghul's lair and gets the details filled in.    Finally, the Joker is now on the loose spreading chaos throughout Gotham City, only to be captured by Batman, but 'stolen,' if you will, from Batman by the Red Hood. All of this leads to the film's climax where Batman and Red Hood debate their different perspectives of morality: Red Hood stating he \\"is the better Batman\\" because he *kills* criminals, thus ridding the streets of them for good. Batman's response is that, as much as he would enjoy killing the Joker, he realizes that if he ever crosses that line...\\"there is no going back.\\" At this point, Red Hood has brutually beaten the Joker and is going to kill him. He tells Batman (GREAT performance here by Jensen Ackles) he needs to make a decision on...    ...well, get the movie and *watch* it to see how it plays out!    COMPLAINTS    They are minor, but...a short run-time, AND DEFINITELY not enough Nightwing/Neil Patrick Harris. As stated, his humor was much-needed in this gritty, violent film. True, Black Mask/Wade Williams was funny as well, but his humor comes while he is beating people up.    FINALLY    I give this movie a 10 out of 10. I really, REALLY enjoyed it. Just hurry up, DC, and release a Red Hood action figure!    BATMAN: UNDER THE RED HOOD    Directed by Brandon Vietti. Produced by Bruce Timm. Written by Judd Winick.    Batman's creators are Bob Kane and Bill Finger.    Run-time is 75 minutes; released on July 27, 2010, by Warner Home Video.    MPAA Rating is PG-13; SPECIAL (blu-ray) FEATURES include: a 'Jonah Hex' short; a look at upcoming Warner Home Video/DCU releases, including interviews with the creators; widescreen format; a 'Robin Origin' featurette; 'Robin episodes' from the 'Batman' animated television series; subtitles.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|For quite some time now, I find it increasingly difficult<br />to find a good book among the growing mass of badly written<br />fantasy stuff. I almost gave up on the genre.<br /><br />But this book I really liked very much. Good writing, great characters,<br />gripping and intelligent story and thankfully, despite that the main characters<br />are members of an order, not to heavy on the religious angle.<br /><br />Can't wait for the next one.
B005HS00V4|5.0|This tour was billed as \\"Orchestra, No Drums. No Guitars\\" - how much clearly could it be stated? If you like Gabriel's songs then I do not understand why you would have a problem with this project. What other artist combines artistic integrity, musical ability & avant garde spirit as well? Who even tries or would have the bonafides?? PG manages to bridge complex ideas & music with enough \\"accessibility\\" to be viable in today's music business. \\"Money grab\\"? To put this together was no cheap endeavor. It is A+ quality in sound, video, & presentation (like everything he has every done). I too was a bit underwhelmed at the \\"sparseness\\" when I first heard one of these shows. Mistakenly thinking, his music is better in it's original form. I do enjoy the originals better I must admit but if you like PG in his \\"purist\\" form: voice, HEART, SOUL, song, message, I don't see how you could dismiss this. I ask anyone unhappy with this release - how would they have done it better? You either like the songs & their intrinsic quality and message or you don't. Otherwise what you receive is a top notch production from a consummate professional the likes of which you rarely see.
B007JWKLMO|3.0|I thought \\"Living In The Material World\\" presented a fairly good portrait of George Harrison's life, music and philosophy.<br /><br />Here's what I would have done differently:<br /><br />-  Less running time devoted to The Beatles and more devoted to George's solo career.  Most of the Beatles stuff was a rehash from \\"Anthology\\".<br /><br />-  More focus on George's guitar playing.  They should have discussed his early country/rockabilly style (influenced by Chet Atkins, Eddie Cochran and others) and his later slide guitar style.  I don't think there was ANY footage of George playing slide!  Some of that should exist in the concert footage; at the very least, they could have shown part of the Dick Cavett clip with George playing slide behind Gary Wright on \\"Two Faced Man\\".<br /><br />-  More video clips.  They should have at least shown a short clip from the Japan tour that George did with Eric and his band in 1991.  An example from that final musical collaboration would have fit in nicely after all the time devoted to the George/Patti/Eric story.<br /><br />-  More discussion of George's solo albums.  I think they only mentioned two or three of them.  There is some great music in those albums!  I would have at least included a discography in the \\"DVD Extras\\", with the track list of each album.<br /><br />-  More generous DVD extras. I felt those were pretty skimpy.  I was hoping for a more goodies like extended interviews, discography, filmography, sessionography, photos, and videos.<br /><br />Well, you can't please everyone, and those are my quibbles.  I did enjoy seeing the film, and it stands as a nice tribute to George.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|\\"Fifty Shades of Grey,\\" by E L James, is one literary forest fire that does the obvious: It sheds both light and heat, burning up pages as it incites and excites. As an author myself, of \\"The Diva Is In The Details\\" (a Kindle eBook in 9 volumes), I can tell you that James' fine book has seized and seared my imagination with what else but the outlandish. The author writes like an \\"agent provocateur\\" deliberately baiting readers, annoying them, humoring them, and regaling them. But not disappointing them. E L James stretches the point to make the point. Ordinary things with ordinary size and shape, can easily be forgotten. Average circumstances recounted in average terms, would fail to occupy memory and be dismissed in an eye blink. The spectacular, the fantastic, the grandiose presents us with the gift of sculpting and shaping and seeing the truth writ large in the mirror that our page-turning is simultaneously revealing. Certainly, a main character's deathless use of the oddly-descriptive \\"fifty shades,\\" as in \\"she turned 50 shades of grey,\\" is atypical speech, even as colloquialism. But that's the point, right? By inciting your attention with this and countless others, you tend to laugh at the gaffes but still get the graphically-ludicrous metaphor, right? Again, that is the point. E L James squeezes us; then she seizes us. Don't think for one second she does not know what she is doing or does not intend to do so. George Orwell, with his enduring, timeless \\"Animal Farm,\\" had barnyard animals talking, fighting, and acting like revolutionaries creating anarchy. The book provoked countless and endless, shameless discussions and carried readers to places of enlightenment that shattered their assumptions...the sacred and the profane. \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" is a wonderful read. It keeps readers awake and alert through numberless devices: skillfully elevating the sublime to the ridiculous; tapping into our psychologies with the skill of a miner panning for gold. By making the small become large; the ordinary, ostentatious; the explainable, inexplicable; and the obvious, obfuscated, she delivers a rollicking story that is moveable feast and mirror. She shows us that we are the ghosts and the flesh of Mother Nature. Bravo, E L James! Write on! As I continue to read your delectable works, I hope you become a Billionaire!<br />[[ASIN:B007VWSYJE The Diva Is In The Details (The Diva Is In The Details Volume 1)]][[ASIN:B007W4G0N8 The Diva Is In The Details (The Diva Is In The Details Volume 2)]][[ASIN:B007W57IU6 The Diva Is In The Details (The Diva Is In The Details Volume 4)]][[ASIN:B007WA36YI The Diva Is In The Details (The Diva Is In The Details Volume 5)]][[ASIN:B007W39OE6 The Diva Is In The Details Volume 3]][[ASIN:B007WI6QBU The Diva Is In The Details Volume 7]][[ASIN:B007WI6QOC The Diva Is In The Details Volume 8]][[ASIN:B007WA54X4 The Diva Is In The Details Volume 6]][[ASIN:B007WI6RS2 The Diva Is In The Details Volume 9]]the small become large; the ordinary, ostentatious; the explainable, inexplicable; and the obvious, obfuscated, she delivers a rollicking story that is moveable feast and mirror.

B0086700CM|4.0|It gets a little boring after you play it for awhile and to buy new characters and upgrade your abilities is expensive. That wouldn't be a problem if it were easy to earn coins!  But its a fun game and I like it. Just ignore the little flaws and you 'll love it!
B003Y5H54W|1.0|An absolutely awful movie.  Waste of time, unbelievable storyline, horrible actors, and strictly for clueless teens.<br /><br />Surprised that it is rated as 3 stars by Amazon reviewers.  Very shocked to see seasoned actors like Julie Christie and Gary Oldman in this mess.  Guess they needed the $$$.
B0086700CM|5.0|I been waiting for this game to come out on kindle and now its here and its so much fun;minus lag spikes that takes you to your doom. Overall best game I've played on Kindle Fire.
0670022705|5.0|Written by the director of the British Museum, the book constitutes a wonderful tour without the aggravation and expense of getting there. This covers the time period from mummies to credit cards and geography from Canterbury to Borneo. Each short text is accompanied by a color picture and an insert by an established expert in the field. There are items as famous as the Elgin Marbles and Rosetta Stone and a very interesting selection of banknotes, maps, cups and various paraphernalia showing life styles and scientific development as well as history.
B0086700CM|4.0|I love this app but the thin is it lags a lot witch normally results in death but other than that I love this app!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game! you can earn coins easily and its such a fun game! I think temple run is a great game!
B005K17RU0|5.0|perfect app and easy to use. I love how easy it is to change your location. nice that its two weeks out also.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Nice book, easy to read... This collection was my first read on my kindle touch...<br />So read It, You will like It!
B00881VLCE|3.0|the app has a weird auto zoom feature where the selected piece gets bigger. This makes it hard sometimes to fit pieces together and there's no reason for it. when scanning through the pieces it is unpredictable when the piece will become selected and drag into the play screen. if a piece is at the very top or bottom of that scroll screen it is nearly impossible to select. the puzzles are always just a little too big for the play area and when you try to center what you have completed it doesn't land where it should. sloppy programming.
B0086700CM|5.0|I play this game all the time and think it so cool. if you don't have this game then you have no life and no friends.... if you do have this app then other people will envy you..... u dicide who do you want to be....the loner with no life. or the person who people envy. get the game...... its free!!!!!!!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was so glad i hadn't read this until all three books were done!! I was hooked, and was surprised.  I never got into the Vampire thing, but for some reason this fantasy world had me reading from book one to three within a week...and knowing Mockingjay was the end of the story, i didn't want it to end.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is a strait simple game. unlike 250+ or spider or any others.it also allows<br />you to change the backs of the cards with your own photos. also the background<br />scene.  d.driskel
B000A0K2JO|1.0|I got the item and tried to use it, it did not work, I contacted the seller who refunded my money, which I guess is good, but I would have preferred a working unit. I would recommend that if you need to free up USB ports just add a USB extension. Save your money
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm a kindle fire User and i am so excited to play I just got the game and cant wait to posy it!!!!!!
B006TQUNX8|4.0|The book is a fairly easy read and there are some clear morals offered from the story and a reflection on our culture's obsession with appearances and such. Some of the characters are interesting, particularly Lord Henry, who really captivates many readers of the book.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|Again, another great read. Can't waitI for the nex John Grisham book. He knows how to keep his reader in suspension. What a great book.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I have never played this type of puzzle before it is very addicting and a great way to pass the time.I would suggest it for anyone.

B006GHA9VQ|2.0|Spoilers ahead.<br /><br />I was so looking forward to the sequel for The Phantom of the Opera - Love Never Dies, which only ran in London and Melbourne for a limited time. I've seen all of the movie productions of The Phantom of the Opera and on Broadway a few times. I preordered the sequel and read the 4-5 star reviews, some proclaiming it to be Andrew Lloyd Webber's best score ever, and I was excited to see the continuation of the story that has enchanted millions. My daughter and I watched it on the heels of The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall (2012) with Ramin Karimloo as the Phantom and Sierra Boggess as Christine, which was a beautiful production.<br /><br />Then we began the highly anticipated sequel. The opening was promising, with the Phantom's belching of \\"Til I Hear You Sing,\\" although even at that point I was not too convinced with the actual performance from Ben Lewis. The rest of the musical was comical, even hilarious at points. The storyline is horrible. There are musical remnants from the original score that remind us it's supposed to be Phantom and Christine Daae, but the casting is all wrong and warps the characters as we knew them. All beautiful technical singers, but they do not embody the spirit of the original story.<br /><br />The setting is in Coney Isle (Island) ten years later. It lends from a \\"Cirque du Soleil\\" feel due to the context. The Phantom (played stiffly by Lewis) is sanitized in this performance, and loses his mysterious and magical appeal. The Phantom, Madame Giry (Maria Mercedes) and Meg Giry (Sharon Millerchip) are established in the freakish heart of the oddities and curiosities of the place. The Phantom laments the decade without his muse, and is able to entice, under guise, Christine (Anna O'Byrne) and her family with an invitation to journey to America to perform at the theater Phantasma.<br /><br />Christine is visually striking enough, but she is a lot more bland and I did not feel her character develop much throughout the story. I could not relate to her at all or felt sorry on her ultimate demise. Raul (Simon Gleeson, whose performance was ok) is a drunk and gambler, losing all his fortunes, and ignores his 10 year old kid, Gustave - a son that is actually fathered by the Phantom with Christine, unbeknownst to Raul. I liked Raul, especially in the 2004 edition of the movie, despite his somewhat selfishness to put Christine at risk in order to draw the Phantom out to capture/kill him, but this story completely destroys it. His gambling is the reason why his wife must now be the breadwinner and conveniently take the assignment in Coney Island. Raul makes a bet with the Phantom on whether Christine will sing, finds out that he has been fathering a bastard child that is not his, loses the bet and is supposed to leave Coney Island broke and without his Christine.<br /><br />Meg Giry looks like Madonna minus her mole from the Material Girl days, and tries too hard vocally to be the \\"Ooh La La\\" girl. She and her mom, Madame Giry (whose voice is dry as sawdust) vie for the Phantom's affections. She becomes deranged when he doesn't show up after one of her best performances on stage, and then kidnaps the Phantom and Christine's love child in a rage against the Phantom for overlooking her talents. Since when did the Phantom care about Meg? She realizes that it's always been about her bff Christine, and ends up \\"accidentally\\" shooting Christine instead of herself or the Phantom, as she threatened.<br />Gustave looks like any ordinary early 1900's young chap, nothing like his true dad, but inheriting his musical abilities and \\"hearing sounds in his head.\\" The kid will grow up messed up - not only does he witness his mother's childhood friend shoot his mother, but his mom reveals that his dad is the Phantom on her last breath. He runs off blindly looking for his fake dad, screaming Nooo!!! for the second time in the musical (first time when he saw the Phantom's face). The ending scene has the two men and the boy surrounding the already dead Christine, some awkward transition from the Phantom holding her to Raul holding her, and then the boy taking off the Phantom's mask, petting the mutated side of the face as the Phantom sings about love never dying.<br /><br />My daughter had to shut it off half way because the singing was literally giving her a huge headache. I forced myself to watch the whole thing. I really tried to like this, but it was huge disappointment. I had very mixed feelings about the Phantom and Christine having a love child in the first place. Maybe it would have been different if Karimloo and Boggess played the parts, or if I did not associate it with the original masterpiece.<br /><br />The production tries too hard to hypnotize through beautiful sets and gorgeous costuming, but fails with annoying and lackluster melodies. The story about the Phantom has always been about love at its core, but this is a tacky rendition of what was a heart-wrenching emotional and captivating storyline.No doubt I may offend hard-core Webber lovers who are able to overlook these glaring failures, but I cannot...<br /><br />Andrew Lloyd Webber, who was your muse for this? You have lost your craft, and no wonder it did not make it to Broadway. New Yorkers would have clamored for their money back.<br /><br />Sad, sad, oh so sad.ng scene has the two men and the boy surrounding the already dead Christine, some awkward transition from the Phantom holding her to Raul holding her, and then the boy taking off the Phantom's mask, petting the mutated side of the face as the Phantom sings about love never dying.<br /><br />My daughter had to shut it off half way because the singing was literally giving her a huge headache.

B000093BDX|5.0|Great titles that took me back, way back to when I was young and life was simple and trouble free.  Just for a short time I was back there with my memories which are all good.
1423101499|5.0|When I need a break from family, job, and school, this series is exactly what I am looking for.  Good characters, smooth story line, humor, hint of romance, and nothing so brain busting as to require me to think.  I just sit back, read the story, and enjoy...thank you.
B00005ASHM|5.0|I love this album and can't understand why I didn't buy it when it was released.  Great tracks which don't dissapoint, and those harmonies.  What a pity we won't get any new ones.

0345803485|1.0|Yes, I know it's \\"Grey\\". But see, here's the important thing to note. Grey with an \\"e\\" is the name, gray with an \\"a\\" is the color. I believe it's not coincidence this author picked the word/color Grey/gray for the title of her book. Gray is a bland color, devoid of much life, much like this book.<br /><br />Anastasia Steele (seriously, really - the puns are endless for this last name) is some twenty-something college chick that goes off to do an interview with a Fortune 500 company because her roommate, who is supposed to do the interview, is sick. I'm not even going to bore you with the faults of this plot line.<br /><br />She enters Grey Enterprises, and has her interview with the marvelous, twenty-seven year old billionaire tycoon with no problems from security, etc. even though she is NOT the name on the interview docket. The number of perfect blondes that work in his office is so cliche, I will again, spare you the agony of this information.<br /><br />From here, she's in love - wants him, needs him, etc... and then the rest of the book is tawdry sex. Spoiler alert: She just looses her virginity to some guy she's doesn't know, that doesn't love her, and has already shown her his \\"room of torture\\". Are girls that naive? Is there so little respect for someone's first time anymore? I could at least respect the character is she'd thought he loved her - give me something to go on here James.<br /><br />I cannot even give this one star. This was, by far, the most mind-numbingly boring book I've ever put my hands on. I would rather read the smut at the grocery store checkout lines. I don't understand what all the hype is about. Yes, there is sex. But not romantic sex, it's abusive sex and maybe that's the problem - I'm just not into and S&D relationship. I believe sex is a partnership. And I'm not preaching to anyone here, I'm not going to expound on the religious context of sex, but I do think that sex is something meant to be shared, not submitted to. That's just my humble opinion.<br /><br />As far as writing and plot goes - we'll just say there is none. I had hoped with all the excitement about the book that an author had finally taken the concept of being racy and combined it poetically with a solid plot and good writing - nope and nope.<br /><br />The vocabulary is truly terrible. It's like she pulled out a thesaurus and just started looking for the biggest words she could find to throw into sentences; a haphazard effort to produce some shred of solid writing. And I will not even begin to dignify the poor sentence structure - was there an editor on this book? Or were they too busy skipping through to the sex scenes to pay attention to the actual writing? I believe that may have been the problem.<br /><br />Everyone I know that has read the books (it's an entire trilogy - three books about sex) and \\"loved\\" them, admitted they just skipped the story and read the sex. That is not what I want when I read a book. When I open to page one, I want to be thoroughly engrossed in that fictional world until I close the book at the end with satisfaction, and a little sadness at saying good-bye to the friends I've made.<br /><br />\\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" was truly unsatisfying. Take that comment however you'd like.<br /><br />I usually try to find something nice to say when I have to write a book review of literature (and I use that word so loosely) that I don't like, so here it is: The roommate, Kate, that suddenly comes down with the flu and sends her \\"bestie\\" off to meet Mr. Grey is the more believable and realistic character in the book. She is smart, witty, and flirtatious in a good way. She's a little loose in the skirt it seems, but it's what you expect from her. She consciously makes these choices and there's a shred of respect for who she is. I also liked Jose, the photographer/best friend. But Anastasia Steele put him in the friend zone, and go figure he's in love with her. I also like the book jacket - it's smart graphics. There - I found three things I liked.<br /><br />I will now return myself to reading real books. I realize I'm the minority on this opinion, and that's okay. I am happily married and my husband is perfectly pleased that a book isn't what swirls around inside my head.re - I found three things I liked.<br /><br />I will now return myself to reading real books.

1466401885|4.0|the book was good.. travis and abby cant they just make up there mind about each other ..... but i could not put it down  and was able to read the all of  book in 4 days
B0029ZA3H4|3.0|Gary is a good writer and easy to read. I did learn some useful tips, but this is mostly a \\"spark dreams\\" book, similar to Rich Dad series. Lots of concepts, without many details, which was Gary's intention I believe.<br /><br />Overall good book and I would recommend to anyone who is not satisfied with their  current job.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|as an avid scifi reader iam not easily impressed. this book has impressed me. with a new take on dystopian future, and the pacing and charactors done to near perfection. i liked this book so much i am compelled to write my first review (using the damned pop up kindle keyboard even because i did not want to wait!)
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Works great and is perfect for spending time during the day.  Use it on my electrify and it works perfect
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I couldn't turn the pages fast enough.  A tale of a beautiful collison of two very different worlds. Exciting, intriguing and billiantly written.
0345803485|3.0|This book was an easy read, I felt like I was reading a book written for teenagers. It is graphic and erotic but that doesn't sway my opinion about its story. Overall it's only OK to me, I recommend reading the first chapter or two before buying.
B0086700CM|4.0|lots of fun to play. sometimes for one hour. very addictive. run run run. faster and faster. however a change in scenic an story would be great.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so addictive. I play over and over again until I beat my highscores. Temple Run&trade; is really a game that occupies you if you're bored. I would recommend this game to anyone. :)
0345803485|2.0|I thought it was entertaining until about halfway through. But by about the middle of the book I became really bored. At the beginning I thought the sex scenes made sense in the context of the story and were entertaining. Then there was really not much happening anymore in the book besides the two main characters having sex. The book seems to have been mainly written for the sex scenes with a little bit of story woven around it. I started skipping over the sex scenes and came to the end pretty fast. I'm really surprised that this is a bestseller. I wouldn't recommend buying it unless you don't have a decent sex life yourself and feel the need to read hundreds of pages about other people doing it.
B0086700CM|5.0|I've been waiting for this game for weeks. and haven't stopped playing it since I downloaded it. Such a great game and thank you for bringing it to the kindle fire.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a great game! It is the perfect time waster and totally addicting. Would recommend the app to anyone!
B004XE0TDW|3.0|First let me start by saying that my review is mostly about the poor quality of the vinyl format.  The music itself is quite good hence the 3 stars.  If i was reviewing strictly the music, i would give 4 stars.  Back to the quality or lack there of.  This was my second attempt in buying a vinyl record from Bon Iver.  My first was For Emma Forever or something like that and i had to return the album after one listen due to the worst quality pressing I've heard.  This copy (although a different album) is not much better.  The music is distorted and muddy.  My suggestion would be to order the CD or MP3 and avoid the vinyl...It's a shame because this kind of music sets up perfectly for vinyl.  Not so much.
B00881VLCE|1.0|Installed and immediately 2 threats were detected by my virus scanner. Uninstalled! Would not get this if I were you. Rated 1 star because 0 not available
0143119680|5.0|I loved this book. I was so sad when I finished it and can't wait for the next book to be released. I listened to it on CD and really connected with the characters and the plot.
B0085157B8|4.0|entertaining and funny, although i did like the first one better,this one did deliver. Now don't go and watch this movie if you are looking for some complex story with surprises around every corner. This movie is \\"B\\" all the way, complete with cheesy over the top acting, nudity, and blood. So if you're looking for a laugh and a couple of \\"please don't show that\\" moments, this is the movie.
B007SGM084|1.0|I have to agree with the others who note that the price is too much. I love my kindle but nearly $30 for an electronic transfer is not justified. In my view the typical e-book should cost no more that about $5. If the publishers would make the price reasonable they would sell many more copies.
B004JUTHVK|4.0|We are big Scorpions fans, Acoustic is a very good concert.  Scorpions tunes set to a different beat.  We purchased the DVD as well.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|The app works very well on my pandigital novel. It really help me read my Bible everyday. I think everyone should download it.
B000HWZ5WE|4.0|Boy does this CD bring back memories.  I originally had this on cassette years and years ago.  I kept talking about \\"Sea of Love\\" and finally purchased this CD. Page/Plant do it again.
B004P1JEWU|4.0|This book is a good example of why e-readers are handy. What would be two thick, heavy and unwieldy books printed have been merged into one. It's cheaper, it's easier and it made me more keen to buy it.
B005LAIGNC|4.0|1st off I would like to say that I really enjoyed this movie.  The graphics are great!  The story itself is good but I liked the HBO movie The Tuskegee Airmen better.  Don't get me wrong Red Tails did not disappoint.
B00881VLCE|4.0|not too bad. plenty of puzzles and like the levels of difficulty. keeps wife entertained. does great on my asus prime tablet.
B004GJDQT8|1.0|Like others I updated the Amazon app and the camera is no longer working to scan barcodes.  I have an Optimus V by LG running Android 2.2.2. My only use for this appp was to scan barcodes to compare prices.  Now the amazon app is useless.  Hard to believe the Amazon developers have not fixed this yet.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|The story is mesmerizing. The acting fantastic. The cimeotography outstanding. It is story about family, integrity, self-respect, self-confidence, the challenges of love and the challenge of living one's personal Christian Faith. And finally you can see the special features that answers that  question \\"how did they do that?\\". And the interviews with the actors and the actual members of the Hamilton Family is as enjoyble and inspiring as the movie. What more needs to be said.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I have gotten many free apps (including this one), but I play this one most of all.  Challenging and fun!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have to say I was originally put off by the unusual title and what sounded like a fairly typical dystopian story, but this is one case where listening to the reviews didn't lead me astray. Wool is a powerful set of interconnected stories, gripping to the end, and a bargain at the price I paid for it. Highly recommended.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I love kittens .  Putting all the pieces together is great.  Taking a blank area and seeing a sweet picture form on a kindle screen is amazing.  I did not know to get other types of the Magic Puzzle you have to come up with some of the green stuff.  I do hope to find some of the puzzles on the free screen.
B0083GPDBO|5.0|Always love movies that give you the sense that you are flying.  I enjoyed the teen male bonding, and sense of indestructibility.  Reminded me of Breaking Away and Carrie.

0765350386|4.0|I AM PICKY. Just wanted to get that out of the way before I start. Mistborn was a thrilling read and a breath of fresh air to someone who loves fantasy but doesn't read a whole lot of it because most of it is garbage. It is easy for me to see how this book and the two that follow got him the incredible job of finishing the Wheel of Time series. This book has a unique magic system which I found fascinating, the characters are well drawn out and the plot flows in a believable manner. This book was well written and as a thrilling ride. Couldn't put it down!
B0086700CM|5.0|best game ever!!!:))so glad it finally games out on the kindle fire! I think you would love this game if u like action!&lt;3
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was one of the best books ive ever read the entire hunger games series was mind boggling!!! I cant wait for the movies!!!! Anyone who wants to slip into another world and become entranced read this¡
B0028IDXDS|2.0|I'm a little jealous that many reviewers say that their kids took to this immediately! not my son. He looked at it with a little bit of interest, put it in his mouth and tossed it on the floor! I tried to leave it his play pen, crib, take it on car rides but he did not show any interest at all and so it went to the 'oh well I tried pile' and that's for that. In all fairness, I would like to add that perhaps it would work if we started our son on this right from the get go instead of introducing it after his regular pacifier because he seems to like one particular brand of pacifiers and the one day I bought a different type that was shaped 'to fit his mouth better' it promptly flew to the floor.

B007G3H8Y0|4.0|Their 2009 release established a significant departure from their usual sound and in 2012, they seem to be driving up that same highway...<br />\\"California 37\\" is fairly similar to it's predecessor: bulky, attention-calling tunes with monster choruses that leave you whistling their melodies (whether you like them or not) just after one superficial listen. There is a clear predominance of radio-ready structured songs (\\"Drive By\\") that showcase, most of the time, \\"pop culture\\" lyrics. These, for the record, name-check several celebrities and, at some points, sound a bit too overstating to be taken seriously. Terms such as \\"birthday suit\\" and \\"crappy purple Scion\\" are used to portray comic situations, but tend to sound a bit juvenile.<br />Though the similarities exist, \\"California 37\\" turns out a bit more eclectic and, might I add, exotic. It's pop rock smashed up against flamenco (\\"50 Ways to Say Goodbye\\"), gospel (\\"You Can Finally Meet my Mom\\") and even country (\\"Bruises\\"). What's impressive is that the songs work well with their different influences and some are highly memorable. But Train has its best moments when they draw out the tropical swagger of \\"Mermaid\\" and the urban beat and guitar distortions on the title track.<br />\\"California 37\\" is not, by any means, a great example of authenticity. It's a solid record from a band who is at the top of their game and wants to stick around a bit longer before reaching to new heights. This leaves us wondering when the \\"train\\" will roll again and, better yet, in what direction.
B0086700CM|5.0|I was so disappointed when I learned that a kindle fire couldn't get this app. now the can! it is the best game ever!!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game.  I am absolutely addicted!  the only problem is that if you play it really long like me it starts to mess up but other than that it is great!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was so captivating, I had to order the next one, and then the one after that. A great thrilling read!

B004EPZ0AC|5.0|Good movie, enjoyed story line, not too short and not too long.  Gave it as a gift, but was also able to view it myself.
B005HSL626|2.0|I downloaded this game for my grandchildren. They played it for about 2 weeks. Then for some reason it stopped working. The title page comes up and then goes back to the main menu. I have no idea what has happened. the children really liked it while it lasted.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Fantastic television!<br />While 'Hound' is the weakest of the series' six installments, the remaining two episodes of Sherlock on this Series 2 set are excellent. Ben and Martin's collective performances are of theatrical release caliber, and the editing in this show is as sharp as a sharp nail, in my humble.<br />While this series 2 is more Sherlock-focused, the dynamics of this investigative duo are still in full effect.<br />And, there's a hat.<br />You'll understand it, upon watching.<br /><br />Enjoyable, to the very end.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|After reading this trilogy three times, I am still enthralled with the characters. Christian is the man every woman dreams about. He is scarred but salvageable, and has qualities that shine over his insecurities. Ana recognizes his goodness and wants to experience some of his wilder side, tone some of it down, but keep the excitement, the Strong, overbearing need for control intact because she is attracted to it Anastasia  learns from him to be a stronger person herself, without having to surrender her soul. There are many rough patches but  he eventually learns to accept her love wholly,without reservation,he learns to accept the love of his family and friends and relinquish the tradgedy of his early life. One of the best love stories I havee read in years. The eroticism  is mind numbing and sure to stimulate YouR lovemaking..Men and woman should read this book. I am seeking my own Christian Grey.[[ASIN:0345803485 Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]
B007HO392S|5.0|The more I listen to \\"Blown Away\\" (and that's quite a bit, because it's so listenable), the more I'm convinced this may be a masterpiece. Underwood has taken nearly every type of country and cross-over song and done each better than anyone else could. In addition, there are a few songs unlike any I've heard recently, including the title track and \\"See You Again,\\" which has more melody in it than the law allows. Underwood's voice is superlative, of course, and her phrasing is excellent. The clarity of her enunciation is superb. Seeing as she co-wrote many of these songs, this album in my mind elevates her another notch or two as an artist -- as if she needed that. But that's what the great ones do -- keep reaching even when they're at the top. Amazing album.

B0088LU3P0|5.0|Matt Weiner, the creator of Mad Men, cites the romanticism of his parents life during the early sixties as inspiration for the setting and tone of Mad Men; the sixties are the edenic time for Weiner and as we approach their end in reality and in the storyline the fall from innocence is inevitable. Our characters and our times are falling in Mad Men and the one criticism to make is that with the heavy thematic emphasis on America's fall from innocence during the sixties and seventies that the characters of Mad Men, once so strong, are becoming place holders for the theme. That said it is very small criticism indeed as Mad Men remains entrancing, must see television.<br /><br />This week we have several surprises, not all of them pleasant. We open with the discovery by Don of Lane's borrowing of money from the company. Don shows us bits of the old Don for better and for worse as does Roger and everybody expresses dissatisfaction with their lot in life and the fatigue that comes with the constant pursuit of happiness. Happiness that seems to be ever receding, a motif in the dialogue this week. Sally does grown-up girl things but then panics when she gets a surprise. Don does give one child their dearest wish. Megan continues to be drain on the narrative, much like many second wives.<br /><br />All in all a strong to excellent episode of Mad Men and one that sets us up nicely for the series finale next week. A.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I really enjoyed the writing in this one. The storyline was intriguing as well. The characters are very well written. In the beginning of the book, I didn't much like Libby Day. For one thing, I am a huge dog lover and whenever someone doesn't like dogs, I'm convinced of their inability to like anything or have emotions. In the book, she \\"accidentally\\" kills her aunt's dog. That didn't sit well with me, but it made me become more emotionally involved with the book. What possesses people to do these things? Libby grew up tough and bitter and mean. Something that stuck with her for over two decades. There are twists and turns and even though her brother Ben was in prison for the murders, you really start believing he was innocent before too long into the book. Which makes the rest of the story all that more intriguing. I recommend this book to people who like a good \\"who done it\\" type of story and people with ties in MO, especially KC, MO might enjoy reading it as well.
B0085157B8|2.0|I knew going into it that it was a mindless gore movie, but with that in mind, this didn't deliver, or at least what it did was over the top ridiculous. The story was choppy, the gore minimal and pretty much consisted of the last 15 minutes. they totally ripped off Teeth at one part. All in all, a total bust compared to the first Piranha. The only thing that has any redeeming value are the hot girls, but even then it doesn't do much. NOT WORTH IT.<br /><br />Terrible. I'd rate this a \\"Instant stream\\" or a \\"torrent\\". Dont waste a lot of money on it.

B000000OPZ|4.0|Most fans of Whitesnake consider this to be the band's best album.  It was certainly their commercial peak and many of the songs are staples of classic rock radio to this day.  I remember when this came out in the late 80's it seemed to be to be a good old fashioned hard rock shot in the arm compared to much of the music that was on the radio at the time.  Since it's formation, other than David Coverdale, the Whitesnake lineup has always been in flux, but this album featured one of the better versions of the band with John Sykes ( Thin Lizzy, Blue Murder) on guitar, Neil Murray (Black Sabbath, Coliseum II, National Health) on bass, and Aynsley Dunbar (Frank Zappa, Journey, Jefferson Starship) on drums.  Instrumentally this band was a force to be reckoned with as all of the member turn in outstanding performances.  Coverdale's voice was never in better shape and soars over the roaring music of his bandmates.  The songwriting is decent enough, pretty much typical late 80's hair metal subject matter, but for the most part it all works.  For me \\"Still Of The Night\\" remains one of the great songs of this era and is the centerpiece of this album.  This line up of Whitesnake would disintegrate shortly after this album was released, which is too bad as it would have been interesting to see where the Sykes / Coverdale partnership could have led them.
B0086700CM|4.0|It's a fairly nice game. repetitive and grows old. itd be nice if there was some relative story or even multiple temples to progress through. but there is one and you repeat it for eternity.

It was nice to see a couple of comments that agree with/validate my thought that the keyboard is the source of that minor problem. I guess I am a creature of habit. I just keep using that old keyboard. That also means that my board has been running pretty much continuously for about 15 months without issue.<br />On a side note, I just built my son a new computer using the newest version of this board the ASUS Z87 LGA 1150 Pro with a new Core i5-4670K processor (also all purchased from Amazon). That is also a very good board and processor combination. It is a really nice motherboard, but I see nothing there that gives me even a little bit of an itch to upgrade. I am still very satisfied with this motherboard in all of my current uses.<br /><br />Original review<br />I purchased this board for my most recent rebuild/ update of my primary gaming/ photo computer. After using it for about three weeks, I am very happy with it.<br /><br />Since I find it useful to see what others have working with a particular mobo, here is what I have installed:<br />P8Z77-Pro Motherboard<br />Intel Core i5 3570K processor mildly overclocked to 4.1 GHz<br />Corsair H100 cooling<br />16 GB G. Skill Ripjaw Z DDR3 2133 RAM<br />EVGA GTX 680 Superclocked<br />128 GB Crucial M4 SATA III (SSD) (OS and BF3 installed here)<br /><br />Reused from previous build<br />Win 7 Home Premium (thought about switching to Professional but no real reason to using 16 GB RAM)<br />Antec 1200 Gaming tower with CP-850 PSU<br />Logitech G9 mouse<br />Logitech G15 (old ancient v1) keyboard<br />Razer Nostromo<br />1 TB WD Caviar Black HA<br />2 ea 1.5 TB WD Green HD's (mostly for multimedia storage/ backup)<br />LG BluRay Rewriter disc drive<br /><br />Installation of the new mobo was very easy. Everything is well labeled. The users guide is a little light, as most are, but very logically laid out for front to back sequential use during initial installation.<br />Once everything was properly assembled, I booted to the BIOS and installed the updated BIOS 1015. I d/l'd the 1015 prior to starting the build to the flash drive. Using the EZ Flash 2 utility it was very easy to update. After a reboot it was off to installing Win7 on the SSD. The rest of the installation went very smoothly.<br /><br />The good:<br />This just blows away my old Core i7 920 on the 1366 mobo with 6 GB of DDR3 RAM. No big surprise there. A lot of the good things for me are related to the SSD and the GTX 680 more than the mobo, but they all have to work together and they do with this board. In BF3 with the video set to ultra or high on all settings, according to FRAPS I am getting about 140-160 fps. Just silly. I could crank everything up until it was stressing the CPU and the GPU, but why? I don't see very much difference with those few other setting moved up on the video.<br />I am also very happy with this set up for Photoshop and Premiere Elements as well as Photomatix. Very noticable improvement over my previous set up even with those applications running off the 1 TB WD Caviar Black drive.<br />The \\"Idiots Overclocking System\\" built into this board is very effective with the combo I have. Getting it to 4.1 GHz using just some of the auto overclock tools was easy. In this configuration, I am seeing a max of 32-33C on the CPU temps while playing BF3. The combo of the cool running ivy bridge processor with the Corsair cooler is very effective. I'll probably venture into higher overclocks when needed, but right now there is no point.<br /><br />The not so good:<br />I find a few issues with my Logitech G15 keyboard losing the LCD apps after the computer has gone to sleep. I considered 4 stars instead of 5 for this, but decided to leave it 5. The reason is that I have seen this before on all of the 4 or so previous motherboards this keyboard has been used with. I am pretty sure it is a Logitech issue rather than an ASUS mobo issue. Frankly I fixed it on my previous board by disabling the sleep mode. I'll probably do the same with this one unless Logitech comes up with a working update. Might be time to dump the G15, but I do actually use the LCD for TS3.<br /><br />Bottom line is that I am very happy with this motherboard. Hope this helps someone.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have to say I usually don't read erotic type books but with all the hype, I had to give it a try. I was actually very surprised that I fell in love with this book as well as the first and second books. I loved the story line. I agree with others that the author over used some \\"phrases\\" and words such as the word \\"mutter\\" and each and every sex encounter ended with that same description of her climax. For me though this wasn't to annoying. In the first book I was honestly SHOCKED at how descriptive the sexual content was but then again like I said I have never read an erotic novel before but by the end of the first book I was over the shock and really enjoyed the books. I read all three very quickly due to the fact the I just couldn't out them down :)
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Rovio should put in a new level called Apollo Birdteen and a new bird that goes under land and isstill visible but whennu click jumps back up anywhere just a suggestion
B001MYIXAW|5.0|What's it about?<br /><br />Oskar, a bullied young boy befriends Eli, a strange perculiar girl who turns out to be vampire. With Eli by his side, Oskar finds love and the courage to stand up to his tormentors. All seems sweet until Eli starts feeding on the locals.<br /><br />Is it any good?<br /><br />Rarely does a horror movie come along that is both beautiful and horrific; `Let the Right One In' is one of those rare gems. Set in Stockholm in the 1980's, most of the action centers around an apartment block during a snowy winter. This dark snowy atmosphere is captured brilliantly by director Tomas Alfredson; mixed with stunning cinematography, the snow brings a sense of confinement which congeals with the children's cold identities. It's in the acting that this movie really shines; leads Hedebrant (Oskar) and Leandersson (Eli) are equally compelling. Oskar is brilliantly vulnerable while Eli is sweet, creepy and terrifying. `Let the Right One In' is a must for any horror fan; it is romantic, disturbing, tender, highly original and chilling; a true masterpiece.<br /><br />Best bit?<br /><br />When Oskar refuses Eli an invitation inside his apartment she enters anyway; the result will leave you haemorrhaging!<br /><br />Did you know?<br /><br />Voted movie of the year by Empire magazine. The last foreign language film to top their list was `City of God' in 2003.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Reminds me of my childhood Oregon Trail game. Super fun! I'd even let my kids play this. Back to playing I go.
B005LAIGPU|4.0|What's it about?<br /><br />A teenager, who decides to film everything in his life, uncovers a mysterious glowing orb with his friends that gives them strange new powers.<br /><br />Is it any good?<br /><br />With great power comes great responsibility! Ok sure, maybe that was Spiderman, but the same can be said for any nerdy kid who suddenly discovers special powers. So, imagine Spiderman got his powers and let them get to his head? The concept of Chronicle is rather simple and not unique, but the character arc had me hooked. Just how bad can this guy get? Ultimately, the film lives and dies by the camera techniques (or gimmick) employed for the entire duration of the film. Every shot in the film is a home video, much in the vein of `Cloverfield'. In some cases it works great, but there are quite a few times throughout the film which took you out of the `movie', as you became more interested in why would he would be filming this, or what camera is getting these shots? Overall, solid performances all around for a relatively unknown cast, great pacing, great action makes for a genially enjoyable film.<br /><br />Best bit?<br /><br />A fight between two friends ends up on top of the Seattle space needle!<br /><br />Did you know?<br /><br />The film was shot for only $15 million and was shot primarily in Cape Town, South Africa.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I couldn't put this book down!!! At first it seems all about sex but as the characters start to reveal who they really are the book has a whole new meaning....a MUST read!!!!!!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|All the hype and not that great. Not as racy as the reviews say. I will probably read the other books but when they become bargain priced. Just when the author had a great section of writing, it then  filled with adolescent musings--\\"my sex\\" and \\"goddess\\".  Yuck! How many times can that be repeated?
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this book because it was required summer reading for my son, who is entering the 9th grade.  It was a delight from beginning to end.  \\"Call it Hunger Games in Space\\".  Having been mostly written around 1985, it was very inciteful, except the author, even then could not foresee the total collapse of the USSR, just 4 years hence, but he did foresee a type of futuristic ipad.  My first experience with OSC, but surely not my last.

B0019N8P2W|5.0|What a steal.  I loved this show growing up and caught a lot of flack for it.  Fortunately for Daria and I, we were both right.  People are stupid, but you do what you can to make it in this crazy world.<br /><br />This 'smart person' cartoon that was way ahead of its time then and today one can still have a blast reliving those high school life lessons from the perspective of someone who didn't belong there.<br /><br />The special features will leave fans wanting but will give a new viewer an important insight about just what this show was about.  The show is very cleaver and writer driven, if you don't already know that :)<br /><br />And for the price you can't go wrong.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|It grasp you right from the beginning and draws you into the lives of the characters.  It can get a little annoying, repetitive through out some parts, but that's where we get the drama.  I thoroughly enjoyed this quick read, wish I had more.

0345803493|1.0|I bought the trilogy.  They were a forth grader level of reading so I finished them all in one day.  I didn't buy them for their intellectual content so I could get past the poor writing, but what I was surprised with is how boring, tame, and childish they were.  I was looking for something new, exciting, something, perhaps, that I had missed out on given my generation (hippy era, free love and all that)...sheez I'm telling you, women these days must be awfully frustrated, naive or infantile if this read turned them on.  I guess we still haven't gotten past the pat on the behind started at birth, this and a pair of handcuffs is all you're going to find in this book.  Save your money...find a cop and ask for a spanking!
B006W0QR1S|4.0|Having been surprised by a very bifurcated sentiment on this movie, and having read  some interesting reviews I was moved to write a short review myself. In the most interesting (3 star) review, echoing many reviewer comments about how the two main characters stared a lot and said little, Ryan Gosling is taken to task for not being accessible. In contrast to this take I found the Gosling character to be very emotionally available, especially in his scenes with Carey Mulligan, I can easily see how it could be seen differently. For me, despite the fact that his expressions are taciturn, it feels to me like he gave a lot of affection to the woman and her son with his eyes. Also, it seems to me that the romance is not consummated because the husband comes back, not because of the character's lack of interest.<br /><br />It could be said (and has been by reviewers as well known as the New Yorker's Anthonly Lane) that the main character is a strong silent type cliché. But I liked the character and Gosling's performance.<br /><br />I was not turned off by the violence as many reviewers were - it seemed like the guy was backed into a corner and had no choice (see History of Violence).<br /><br />I had not picked up on his lack of concern for wearing a blood stained shirt in public.<br /><br />One reviewer called the main character a psychopath. I don't see that.<br /><br />I found Albert Brooks character hysterically funny not because of his lines but because i could not believe that Albert Brooks was playing a mobster.<br /><br />Quibbles:<br /><br />The main character's attitude towards money was mystifying, especially in the ending.<br /><br />As many have noticed there is not that much driving in \\"Drive\\".  Of course the word \\"Drive\\" could be said to have multiple meanings!

B00884GR0W|1.0|don't waste your time even with the free version. very glitchy and has lots of bugs. this game has great potential but was created very poorly. wait for minecraft pocket edition it is much better
0439023521|3.0|This story is great, and the book does captivate you, but there are some things that I don't like: First, she doesn't describe very well some part. Second, the novel is written in first person, as a reader, obviously we miss on a lot of action, and miss a lot of stuff, we're supposed to know... This novel is about a 24 people thrown into an \\"arena\\" until they kill each other off, and only one survive.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The hunger games is about north America being cut into 12 districts and then the Capitol every year 24 contestants go into an arena to fight and die a brutal awful painfull death. This book is one of my favorite books it has so many different genre types.  The gore is a huge part contestants go take knives swords or any other brutal weapon and kill each other one kid gets his neck snapped another kid gets a spear through the heart not going to say who. But it is still a fantastic book and would rate it 5/5 stars.

B0070Z4M4I|4.0|In my opinion watching this movie is like watching the deleted scenes of the 1982 film. Starts and leaves you ready to watch the original again.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Good story(its the same as the original except you are getting the beginning now)<br />Special effects(modern technology is great with the right budget as this film had)<br />Continuity(the story seamlessly flows into the other, and the creature looks the same)<br />Good acting(none of the actors were cheesy or overdone)<br /><br />Cons:<br />Did have a few scenes that were rip offs of the original.<br /><br />Other thoughts:<br />I like this movie, it was enjoyable and entertaining. No its not an oscar winner but who clicked on this thinking it was. Its a pretty descent action thriller. Good suspense throughout.  Basically this movie was like watching star wars episodes 1-3, its the same story as episodes 4-6 but you are getting more details about the overall history of the story. If you like the 82 film you will most likely enjoy this as well, you may find a few annoyances but it is entertaining and nostalgic.
B007SGM084|5.0|This trilogy was the best I've read in a very long time.  I couldn't put it down.  Now that I finished it I'm sad I don't have it to read anymore.  This is one series I will reread over and over again.  Can't wait to read another from this author.

B003YL4LYI|4.0|This book does not stand on its own.<br /><br />If you have not read any of the other books in the series you should read one or more of them before pulling the trigger on buying this one.<br /><br />This series is not for everyone, especially those who want their books to have a single climaxing event. Nor is the series for people who can't stand their favorite characters to abruptly get killed, usually by a character whom the reader is not meant to like. (Of course if you consider that a climaxing event, and you like those, lots of those, this series is a must read!) Nor is this series for people who think every plot element must be explained before the termination of every book.<br /><br />All of that said, I enjoyed reading this book. The characters are enjoyable (just as enjoyable as in the previous books, judge accordingly), usually right up to the moments of their deaths (notice a trend here?). The fantasy world in which the stories are written is for the most part interestingly described and leads to contemplation of how various parts interrelate. And I am enjoying the plot and sub plots (present tense, the series isn't concluded).<br /><br />I think a safe rule of thumb for buying (or not) this book would be, if you really enjoyed the other books (all of the other books) in the series and have no expectations about where things will have to be by the end of this book you are a good candidate for buying this book.<br /><br />If you did not like the earlier books, you really need to move on, find a different author or series to follow. Also if you do not think the author can wrap up the series before his death, do not buy.<br /><br />Kindle eddition note: Several places in the book (about five or so) sentences would be missing words between pages (moving ahead a page would skip parts of sentences) this didn't make the book unreadable, but this is the first book I've encountered this on Kindle (Kindle for Windows Phone).
B0086700CM|5.0|Downloaded this game the other day and can't stop playing it! Love this game - I highly reccomend it to everyone.
B0067R0APK|5.0|A great weather app (no-ad version is worth the money) if you're not looking for a clever weather widget (I wasn't).

B0052VUNHC|5.0|I read this book after reading the Fifty Shades Trilogy twice,  and I wanted to move on to something new.  The same friend that recommended those books suggested this one and I fell for it hook, line and sinker.<br /><br />That isn't to say this book is like the Fifty Shades books at all.  It's a different setting, different age group, different type of story line but I LOVED Travis and Abby.  I found myself not able to put this book down, read it in one day.<br /><br />People complained about the violence and the co-dependency of these characters but I can't say I was one of those people.  If I had been friends with someone like Abby dating a Travis in college, perhaps I would feel differently? But even then, this was a story about two fictional characters, and any characters that got involved in the violence were also not real.  I would say it's all in how you choose to read something.  Some people read the Fifty Shades books and only saw Sex, some of us read a love story.  Some people will read this and only see violence or an \\"unhealthy\\" relationship - again, some of us read a love story.<br /><br />As a side note, my pet peeve in reading reviews (not just of this book) is when people claim the story is unrealistic.  Well, duh! It's fiction.  We are the same little girls that watched Cinderella and The Little Mermaid.  We are champions of Kermit and Miss Piggy (really, a Frog and a Pig).  We wait for the happy ending before the credits role.  We wanted Baby and Johnny to live happily ever after, how old was her character again in that movie? We don't want realism...or at least I can be honest enough to say, I don't.<br /><br />I did find some errors in the book that suggested to me the need for a proofreader, but all in all I loved the story line and the characters (the supporting characters of America and Shepley almost as much as Travis & Pigeon/Abby).<br /><br />I was so sad for it to be over, that I returned right to the beginning and started it again.  Even then I wasn't finished and I'm still left wanting more!then I wasn't finished and I'm still left wanting more!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I should have purchased the trilogy in the beginning instead of one book at a time.  Once you read the first book, the second and third are a must read.  I really enjoyed the pace of the book, and look forward to seeing the second movie.
0345803485|2.0|I'll start with a few confessions: All the hype surrounding E L James' erotic novel Fifty Shades of Grey finally prompted a download to my Kindle. However, a stockpile of Bing Rewards meant I didn't actually have to pay for what may be the most horribly edited book ever to become a bestseller.<br /><br />Simply put, curiosity finally got the better of me after having a few good laughs with my husband over all the delightfully negative reviews already on Amazon. Plus, I wanted a lite read for a long Memorial Day weekend drive. Not to mention, various snippets have shown ladies from the View, Good Morning America, and countless other shows referring to how hot the book got them. What's titillating about this book? Nothing. For supposedly being an S & M novel, the sex is surprisingly bland. And repetitive.<br /><br />What bothered me the most as a reader is how the story is narrated in first-person point of view, and yet the author still uses italics to represent Anastasia's banter with her sub-conscious. Ana's repeated reference to her vagina as being down there creates unintended comical effects. Yes, Ana's head is apparently in her vagina. She is a horribly conceived character devoid of personality, except for the moments when she refers to others by their defining traits, such as Blonde One and Blonde Two.<br /><br />Although unlikely, it's believable that a young woman would remain a virgin throughout four years of college. What is less believable is Ana's never having experienced an orgasm. Specifically, the reader soon sees that almost anything can make Ana climax. Then one must consider she does not have her own lap-top or even an email address! Reasons are never given why she is best friends with a wealthy roommate. Plus she's a decidedly British girl who likes her tea bag out. Yeah, all college students living in the land of Starbucks eschew coffee for tea. The scene where Ana vomits after downing five margaritas was almost good. Throughout the rest of the book she's drinking wine all the time, so as with everything else, she seems to lose her innocent qualms quickly.<br /><br />Then there's Christian Grey. E L James does manage to create a few intriguing motivational points to establish his character, but they fail to coalesce into believable actions. For being such a supposed dominant, he's always giving in to Ana. This young billionaire is on the phone a lot, but it's never clear how he made his fortune. Given his age, the author should have fashioned him after Mark Zuckerburg. The way E L James incorporates the clauses of their contract and emails between Christian and Ana read as filler and the sure mark of an amateur writer. But it's shame on the editors and publishers, not the author.<br /><br />Even if Fifty Shades of Grey did get started as Twilight Fanfiction, there is no excuse for how shoddily it reads. E L James obviously knows little about the geography of North America, and much of the gallivanting about did little to advance the story, particularly the narrator's trip to her mother's in Savannah, GA (My guess is that it might be the one place in America the author has some familiarity with since she was specific put the mother's house near Tybee Beach.) Alas, a re-write could have set the novel in and around the author's London home rather than the far-flung Seattle location. Perhaps then the setting details would have added, rather than, detracted from the story.<br /><br />All novels show promise.

Then there's Christian Grey. E L James does manage to create a few intriguing motivational points to establish his character, but they fail to coalesce into believable actions. For being such a supposed dominant, he's always giving in to Ana. This young billionaire is on the phone a lot, but it's never clear how he made his fortune. Given his age, the author should have fashioned him after Mark Zuckerburg. The way E L James incorporates the clauses of their contract and emails between Christian and Ana read as filler and the sure mark of an amateur writer. But it's shame on the editors and publishers, not the author.    Even if Fifty Shades of Grey did get started as Twilight Fanfiction, there is no excuse for how shoddily it reads. E L James obviously knows little about the geography of North America, and much of the gallivanting about did little to advance the story, particularly the narrator's trip to her mother's in Savannah, GA (My guess is that it might be the one place in America the author has some familiarity with since she was specific put the mother's house near Tybee Beach.)

B007BZM30M|1.0|In the modern music standards she should sing: Hey i just met you and this is crazy, but there's my room so **** me baby. I can't believe someone said this is her favorite song - the lyrics are just so dumb that my IQ decreases 20% each time I hear this pathetic song. The reason it's a call me MAYBE is because no guy in his right mind would call a dumb b**** like her to go on a date like she'd like, but just to get it in and then call a cab for her - jersey shore style. It's not like she's going to have another \\"hit\\" so good riddance once they stop playing this song, I mean piece of crap that a 7 year old on crack wrote. She can't sing either like 80% of the new artists on the top 40 so of course her voice is auto tuned and since people can't play an instrument anymore in the modern music industry they just drop a lame synthetic beat. Oh, and I am no old guy, I'm 22 - I like music that is actually music and I don't mind top 40 songs but crap like this song at #1 just shows that the end of the world is near...
B003U74NQW|2.0|Words really can't describe this movie. Was relatively bored throughout and thought the acting lacked incredibly. At the end I felt like it was just one big waste of time.
0345803485|5.0|I really enjoyed reading all three books!! I fell in love with christain grey and how romantic and thoughtfull he is!! S such wonderful books so sad that I'm done.  I guess ill just have to \\"Stowe my twitchy palm\\" and wait for the next book to come out!!
B004T4LUPW|5.0|This is just what the doctor ordered.  I don't need a lot of complicated features in my calendar.  This, while not bare bones, is a simple and functional calendar.  Easy to figure out, and easy to use.  What more can you ask for?  I am very satisfied.
1455870137|5.0|High School Senior Quentin Jacobsen finally connects with his lifelong crush Margo Roth Spiegelman for one adventurous night only to have her disappear. He becomes obsessed with following the clues he believes she left for him, but soon realizes that friendships and crushes are reflective, each more mirror than window. She was his paper girl, popular with all the right clothes, and he was her paper boy, the hero of her fiction as a 10-year-old. Quentin obsessively researches and visits paper towns in hopes of finding Margo. Reading Whitman's Leaves of Grass all along the way, he unearths a kind of grass roots connection between the popular crowd, jocks, computer nerds, and band geeks. Through searching for Margo, Quentin finds himself. Paper Towns is John Green at his finest, a triumph of literature and life.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was not able to put this series down. I think it was the first time I did not skip any paragraphs reading a book. It was a fun, quick read that left you wanting more. The series is third in my favorite books / series, right behind Ender's Game and Time Enough for Love.

B007549W62|2.0|Let me say that I'm a big fan of post-apocalyptic films. I love witnessing a creative team's vision come to life on the screen as they tackle the complexities of contemporary humans in futuristic, lawless societies.<br /><br />However, The Divide just didn't do it for me. It focuses on what happens when people are locked in a small space together and lacks nuance in that treatment. It reminded me more of a hatchet horror film than the psychological thriller it wants to be. The Divide intentionally feels claustrophobic, but unfortunately it's equally cramped in its ability to challenge the viewer.<br /><br />This movie should have been a short, 30-minute film focusing on fewer, more sympathetic characters. Instead it's a long mess with nothing to grab on to. (Felt like one star, but giving it two for the acting.)
B0086700CM|5.0|I was So excited when this came out for the Fire, as I dont have any Apple products. Happy to say it!
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|We're a long ways from the Young and the Restless, but that would be an equally fitting title because nobody in Westeros can stand still and few live to be old.  The soap opera is alive and well.<br /><br />I've never read a single word from the Martin books but darn it if I'm not packed and ready to move to Westeros.  There's seemingly naked ladies on every street corner and ten blood feuds for every man, woman and child.  Despite it's crass manor, Game of Thrones is the house guest you will likely never ask to leave.  Every week you are treated to an orgy - literally - of drinking, whoring, double-crossing, incest, murder and even the occasional magic among other skullduggery.  Tyrion has got to be the baddest dude since Omar walking the streets in a trench coat.<br /><br />I'm not sure how this all plays in the books, but it makes excellent television.  Game of Thrones is essentially everything missing from almost every other tv show I've seen.  Ever.  Thanks to the wealth of literature to draw from, Game of Thrones is the show every other show wants to be.  LOST wanted to be this show.  Sopranos wanted to be this show.  ROME tried like hell to be this show.  But Game of Thrones succeeds in actually presenting a solid, thoughtful, satisfying and logical story from beginning to end.  There are few random machinations of plot or characterization that do not propel the audience forward.  A ten episode season of Game of Thrones is better than 20 of most other tv shows.  It's not since BBC's Sherlock has a show made an art out of brevity.  There are more than likely throngs of book fans clamoring for clarity when such a large volume is compressed so much, but it's all the better for the tv viewer.  If I wanted everything the book offered - I'd just read the book.<br /><br />Season two is turning out to be a notch or two below the first season, but it was a hard act to follow after all.  Even on it's own as a standalone story - fiery cliffhanger and all - season 1 is aheck of a ride.  Seriously, stop the story right there in the sand with Daenerys and you can infer quite a bit.  Game of Thrones is preachy, over-sexed, bloody and at times, downright esoteric.  But boring?  No.  It took me two full seasons watching episodes multiple times to figure out most of who belongs to what family and all that but it never really mattered.  Dothrakis throw a mean wedding party. A Lannister always pays his debts.  A Stark is always honorable.  And though winter is coming, dragons are too.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This product is a good time killer when flying and having run out of reading material.  The only negative is that there is too much advertising with it.
B007R3AZNK|4.0|This new offering by Joe is heavy on the blues side. Much of it I think highlights his singing, other than his playing. If you want to hear his guitar virtuosity watch/listen to his live show recorded at the Beacon Theater. It's beyond 5 star. One reviewer wondered about a collaboration between Joe & Derek Trucks. I agree, and for some reason I couldn't help but substitute Derek's wife, Susan Tedeschi, singing some of the songs on this cd. I think the three of them on the same stage would be killer.
B005COO1X6|1.0|Come on, folks. A man eating car with no explanation of how or why it has appeared at this particular rest stop?  And the ending---it just seems King got tired of his own story and decided he'd had enough.  Don't get me wrong...I love King's stories, and as a horror writer myself, to me he remains the modern day gold standard.  But when he cops out, it shows...and Mile 81 is a total cop out. (This can be taken literally since a cop IS taken out in this story.)  To be fair,  the plot starts off  well and with promise---but then?  No cigars this time, Steve.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I know most people think sequels are usually not as good as the first book, and most of the time it's true, but I really think this book is as good (or close to it) as 'The Hunger Games'.  It's paced quite similarly to the first book.  I really enjoyed if and read it just as quickly as the first one.
B0086700CM|5.0|The first time i visited the appstore i was like no temple run what a bummer i am so happy they finally got it i thought it would never happen. I love it!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|This is not an easy book to read.  Not because of the writing, but because of the content.  Don't recommend reading before bedtime.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a fun game that is very easy to play. The replay factor is good. Runs great on the Kindle Fire.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is the best game ever and I had it on my ipod put the screen is so much bigger and better.

B007SGM084|5.0|I must have read a 100+ books , but have to say this one really had me hooked . I was a little not wanting to read but finally broke and got it. I took me 4 days to.read the whole trilogy . I think this book was outstanding especially for women who somewhere in their<br />Subconscious have a dirty thought of a intense love like this . I fell in love with the characters and am sad the book is done. You must read the entire trilogy and read between the lines..
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is probably the best one for kindle fire! We need more games this fun! Can't wait for more games from this developer!
B003UESJH4|3.0|Okay I know that everyone loves this movie and I think it might have even won the best picture award. However sitting through every minute of this movie is torture. Honestly I have only seen a few other movies that were not as boring as this one. All these british accents anhd stuffed up stuffy stuffs. This is NOT what I am into. Please can we keep this dry, bland, relying on tons of conversations type of acting back in British Hollywood. I can't seem to taker these actors and actresses seriously, I cannot get into it, seems like they are not so good at pretending to be what they are. Thumbs down... but nice attempt at something serious.
B000TU16GS|5.0|i find this a perfect book for any child under the age of 5. i loved it so read it. its a great book
145162445X|5.0|Caveat #1: If your idea of \\"nothing\\" is \\"that from which only God can create something,\\" then that's all there is to it. There's nothing that anyone could ever say to make you change your mind. Consider revising your definition...<br /><br />Caveat #2: If you take it by decree that \\"out of nothing, nothing comes,\\" then you are merely assuming what is sensible. But, as science teaches us, what is sensible isn't always supported by evidence. Consider applying scepticism to assumptions that are sensible...<br /><br />You will learn something from this book if you meet the following criteria:<br /><br />Criterion #1: You accept that \\"nothing\\" can mean something other than \\"that from which only God can create something.\\"<br /><br />Criterion #2: You acknowledge that sensible statements such as \\"out of nothing, nothing comes\\" are not necessarily true by virtue of being simply sensible.<br /><br />If you meet the above criteria, you will thoroughly enjoy this book. Lawrence Krauss takes us on the scientific roller coaster ride that has led to our current picture of the universe: from Einstein's cosmological term to dark energy, from baryonic matter to dark matter, from the Big Bang to Inflation, from weighing the universe to directly measuring its geometric curvature...you will find it all in this book.<br /><br />Krauss gives us three versions of \\"nothing\\":<br /><br />1- Empty space + laws of physics<br />2- No space + laws of physics<br />3- No space + NO laws of physics<br /><br />and for each of them, he argues how a universe can plausibly emerge from the \\"nothing\\" at hand without any hocus-pocus. \\"Plausibly\\" is the word to remember and as Krauss, himself, has noted, the mere possibility that our universe could have arisen from nothing given what we know about the universe today is, itself, an amazing discovery.<br /><br />Read this book, expect to be disturbed by what you will learn, and remember that the universe is more imaginative than you are!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is soooooo addicting. So glad it is out for kindle fire. On Kindle it doesn't read touch well.
0446343129|5.0|This book came highly recommended byy father in law. We eat a very Paleo diet, and I just wanted to educate myself even further about sugar. As soon as I read it, I will write a thorough review of the book. Fast shipping. Can't wait to read it!
B0086700CM|5.0|love this game...was so happy to see it available for my Kindle Fire!  itsthebest game that's come along in quite some time
B005HSL626|2.0|Extremely glitchy for the KF. Have it on my ipod and love it, but this one keeps cutting me out of my game and going to the main screen. Other annoying glitches, too! Also, really lacking a major update that the iOS app got a while ago and until that update I sure wont be playing this much at all!!
B005LAIGWS|1.0|Ok look when I first saw the trailer for this movie. I was like I want to see this ASAP. So I went to see it and I wanted to get up and leave. My buddy next to me just fell asleep because this movie was so bad. I have seen a lot of movies in my day. By far this is the worst movie I have ever seen. Also Cage sucked in this movie because the writers made him say dumb stuff. So over all do not buy this movie. I repeat DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE. On a side note I did see the first ghost rider and it was ok but this one well it sucks.
0802473156|5.0|This was a great book that really shed some light on what was wrong and needed to be changed in my marriage.  It was an eye opener and I recommend to anyone that may be having troubles in any relationship but both parties need to read it for it to really be useful.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I will agree with A.R. Bovey's review on here. He/She is very spot on about the take away of the last book. Reading that review helped give me a different perspective, despite that I still did not like the conclusion of the Hunger Games series.<br /><br />For me personally, I felt that the last book rushed through to finish, becoming psychologically exhausting and emotionally maddening. It took me a few days to get over the heaviness and slight agitation from finishing the book. It was a different pace from the first two books and much of the soul of those books are lost on the third. The Katniss most of us fell in love with will barely resemble her at the end.<br /><br />The last section of this book is titled \\"Assassination\\". That word alone describes to me what has been done to each of our beloved characters in this book, especially Katniss, even if some remained alive in the end. I guess those are the casualties of war.<br /><br />Yes, I agree that Suzanne is a very talented writer, but I'm just not a fan of how it was rushed to such an ending.<br /><br />This is a book I would never ever read again and the thought of watching it as a movie would probably push me into a depression.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it keeps me entertained and not bored for hours. I love it! I like how some games are challenging and others aren't. it really helps me stay at it instead of quitting like I feel like doing sometimes
B00000JLWW|3.0|although i dont agree that it is the greatest movie ever made,  it wasnt bad either, although decaprio is not my fave , he did an ok job , the reason why i watched it was because i like period dramas, i like kate winslet, and kathy bates, i would say 60% of the movie was good, the only complaints i have are, it was too long,it could have been an hour shorter, and kathy bates could have been given a bigger part ,and i think too much was spent on the film,
B0086700CM|5.0|I was waiting to long to get this game on my kindle fire app store I LOVE THIS GAME !!(:(:*yay*
B007DLPKF4|1.0|i like woody allen movies, but not this one, the lead charcater has the same mannerisms , the same wallk, same hand gestures,as woody in his movies, it seems that woody wanted to be in the movie, but maybe he was too old to be the charcter, he casted an actor to walk talk gesture like himself, i would rather watch annie hall, or hanna and her sisters, than watch this movie ,and also the hands in the pockets like woody, maybe the younger generation didnt notice it while watching because they arent familar with woody allen, but to me i immediatly notice this annoying aspect of the charcter, woody, if you are going to write a movie write one better than this.awful.yuk
B005SZNZAY|5.0|There is no one in the music business today who has a voice like Chris Cornell. I was led to this acoustic album from Pandora where his song \\"Like a stone\\" popped up and I immediately rushed to buy it. Honestly his voice is like soft velvet, smooth as silk, with a rough, tough edge to it. I am transported when I listen to him-I just close my eyes and let his voice envelop me. I was a fan from the Temple of the Dog album, and \\"hunger strike\\" has always been one of my favorite songs, so I was so excited to learn of this album even though I had never listened to Audioslave's songs before. these acoustic versions are easily my favorite versions of his songs. Stripped of all the other instruments the beauty of the music, and power of the words just leap out. Chris is a brilliant musician and prolific songwriter, and the best male voice out there today-honestly, his female equivalent would only be Adele. If you do not have this yet, do yourself a favor and buy it now-it will become an instant favorite. Thank You Chris Cornell for this album.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Even though Amazon already approves PDF..... this app is capable of Flash Player and it provides more capability for Flash applications. In order to have flash player on, you need to go to your Internet settings and enable the flash reader so it is &quot;always on&quot;.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|After reading book one I was immeiately drawn in to the series.  My only wish for Ms.Steele is that she would have had a little more backbone. There were times when Christian definetely deserved to encounter the full wrath of her anger and betrayal. I would have loved to have had the opportunity to hear the story told through the  filter of Christian's mind at times.  He is so tortured and would have been more likeable if the readers could have understood through his mind just what emotions and thoughts were running  through them. (maybe the author should write a version coming from Christian's point of view. Just athought) I definetely recommend searching you  tube for the songs mentioned they do help bring him some civiliaty
0061122416|5.0|This is a must read book.  I read it twice within two weeks and now reading again.  The insite to one's self is unbelievable and the spirit into the heart and soul is awakening.  It opens your heart, mind and soul and even if one does not believe in love and destiny.  It is one that will not be given away but very highly recommended.  I plan on reading more of his writings.  Thank you.
B0086700CM|5.0|its a great game i could not put the game down its so addicting OMGGG OMG OMG OMG BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT!!!!!!!!! im not kiddin u should trust me:))))
B007SGM084|5.0|I had no idea what the books were about, I was just told to read them by a friend.  Well, what a pleasant surprise!  I do not usually enjoy reading romance novels, but let me tell you this is FAR from a typical romance novel of any kind.  This is dramatic, intense, pornographic, educational, indulgent, and wondrous.  I couldn't shut the book from page on through the final page of book three.  I love the characters and how they each evolve too.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|I just finished watching Love Never Dies, and it is a spectacular production. I was excited from the second I heard that it was being shown in theaters (albeit for a limited time), but I was disappointed when I realised I couldn't go see it. So, one of my relatives was kind enough to pre-order it for me on DVD.<br /><br />In spite of what Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber said, I think it's absolutely vital to see The Phantom Of The Opera (the stage show AND the 2004 film version) before viewing Love Never Dies, as the original is referenced several times throughout Love Never Dies, in dialogue, music and song. Some songs even sound like the musical equivalents of several songs from The Phantom Of The Opera (I don't mean that as a put-down in any way; merely an observation on a brilliant choice of music and lyrics by Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber and Glenn Slater).<br /><br />The story is absolutely gripping. Plenty of drama, story, spectacle and show-stopping songs in the vein of The Phantom Of The Opera. A job bloody well-done.<br /><br />My favourite songs from this production are Til I Hear You Sing, Look With Your Heart, Beneath A Moonless Sky, Once Upon Another Time, The Beauty Underneath, Devil Take The Hindmost and Love Never Dies. However, every song is top-notch. Well-written sequel. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Surrender to the pull of The Beauty Underneath, and find that Love Never Dies.
0345803485|4.0|While yes this book is poorly written after you get through the first book the second and third are the best. I bought this book despite all the negative reviews and throughly enjoyed it. The writer does leave a little for us to imagine and make our own assumptions. However I would have used more descriptive verbage for sure. The writer is very repitious with what the charaters do, which for me gets irritating.
B0086700CM|5.0|I was so happy when I downloaded this game nd its very addictive nd super fun ive played it for hours

B0086700CM|4.0|thhis game is ment for two types of people, ones with no lives and ones with waaay yo much time on their hands, if you find that you have beaten this game (unlocked every thing)  then you are both.
B002UM5BXW|3.0|Spending a few hours in this guy's head would be disturbing. His book is scattered, and really quite strange. Delusions of grandeur seem to run rampant through what is really just a kitchen memoir.<br /><br />I am somewhat appalled at the high praise this book has received over the years.
B0086700CM|5.0|I &lt;3 this game! Its so addicting!! I play it all day and night!!! Its a game that captured my heart the first time I played it!
B003LSTK8G|5.0|Reads like a thriller. Brilliantly written. Underscores the meltdown with what actually happened. Takes out all the political BS and just tells the truth about the meltdown, who caused it, who knew what was happening, and the very few who saw the meltdown coming.<br /><br />Explains some very technical stuff in a flowing, casual style that makes it all clear to a lay person (like me). Have recommended it to everyone I know.<br /><br />Great book. Would like to give it six stars.
B0079R8KXG|5.0|The cover works well to protect my Kindle Fire.  I'm so glad I purchased it at the same time as my Kindle so I didn't risk getting scratches on it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I totally agree with other reviewers. This is one of the best Bible app you can get for your tablet or ereader. A must have in your device, for sure.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This book was a pleasant surprise. I found a review of it online and decided to give it a shot and I was not disappointed. The author does a great job of creating a character that you genuinely care about. I had a hard time putting this book down because I just had to know what Kvothe was up to next.<br /><br />The plot moves at a good pace, and you don't need to write a journal to help you keep track of everything. The supporting cast is also good. I enjoyed each and every one of the Masters at the University, and I despised the villain of book one, Ambrose. There is also the underlying story of the Chandrian that I look forward to learning more about.<br /><br />In a nutshell, I am really looking forward to the sequel and I just hope it lives up to its predecessor.
B0086700CM|5.0|I loved it but as previous comments said it does lag so if thy gets fixed I wont have a single problem... how do u to the cheat? I been trying and ant get it
0345803485|1.0|The best thing to come of this book are the multiple cleverly written reviews posted here that describe how repellant this book is much more eloquently than I could ever hope to.  I've read good, steamy romance novels before.  This pales in comparison.  I love a good teeny bopper love story.  This isn't that either.  And now, thanks to this book, I have read trash written at a thrid grade reading level yet trying to appeal to a mature audience with a taste for the taboo. Someone threw money into the publicity for this book, I have no idea why, but I'm annoyed I got pulled into it, because I could've done something else with my time.  Twilight and Hunger Games and Girl with the Dragon Tattoo were all written just as poorly, yet at least they were somewhat intriguing stories.  I'm sure Ms. James is laughing all the way to the bank with this series.  Good for her.  Maybe she'll donate to charity.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is good for when u are board or when angry birds makes u angry or when u just u fell the need to run but ur to lazy to go outside

B005V2EVBQ|3.0|This is a good cover for the Kindle, however it's a poor stand for the Kindle.  The groove in the back isn't large enough to hold the edge of the cover causing it to fall when you try to type.

B002M9WW30|3.0|I bought this collection thinking it was going to really have REAL Blu-Ray video quality....But unfortunately the video quality is terrible!! Watch a movie and it will view completely grainy throughout the entire thing. I felt like I was watching a VHS the whole time. I think there was better quality watching it on DVD if I recall. Either way this Blu-Ray has no video improvements since everything looks grainy on screen with terrible video quality.

B0000CABJ1|4.0|I write this after the unfortunate death of Donna Summer one month ago.  I cannot stress enough the true awesomeness and power of this icon.  She paved the way for other acts such as Madonna (but Donna is far superior to her) and other pop icons.<br /><br />This greatest-hits disc has ALL the hits plus 2 DELICIOUS new tracks -- albeit the hits being radio edits.  Sadly, there are no tracks from her 1974 debut, \\"Lady Of The Night\\", so if you don't have that particular CD, now would be a great time to get it.  It's pretty rare so hopefully you can still find it.<br /><br />This disc is somewhat of a follow-up to her other greatest-hits record, 1994's \\"Endless Summer.\\"  (some tracks are substituted)  Her sex ode, \\"Love To Love You Baby\\" and futuristic dance track, \\"I Feel Love\\" helped catapult Donna into the stratosphere and made people NOTICE her.  I loved her 70's music the most over her later hits, the former being \\"I Love You\\", \\"Could It Be Magic?\\", \\"The Wanderer\\", \\"Spring Affair\\", \\"MacArthur Park Suite\\" (I'm referring to the 17-minute version), plus \\"This Time I Know It's For Real\\", \\"I Don't Wanna Get Hurt\\", \\"Supernatural Love\\", \\"Heaven's Just A Whisper Away\\", \\"Stamp Your Feet\\", and \\"I Will Go With You.\\"  There are many more Donna Summer songs that I am in love with but it's quite numerous to mention.<br /><br />For those of you die-hard fans, Donna Summer also did a lot of non-album tracks but they are very hard to find.  (Two of my personal favorites are 1994's \\"La Vie En Rose\\" and 2005's \\"I Got Your Love\\".) With that being said, Donna, indeed, DID work very hard for her money and truly deserved it.  She will forever be missed by the entire world.  Her music will last for many more generations throughout this century, and then some.

B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Most people aren't paying attention to North Korea.  There is evil in this country.  Any government that would do this to its citizens is capable of unspeakable acts.  We have babies born in prison but we do not keep them there for the rest of thier lives because of who thier parents are.<br /><br />People the world over need to exspress out rage over the treatment of innocents living in these camps.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is very challenging. I play it for hours. Even when i close my eyes i will be playing it in my mind. lol.
0451169514|4.0|************ SPOILER ALERT ****************************<br /><br />I finally got around to reading IT to find out what all the sensation is.<br /><br />To speak in percentages, I loved about 80% of the first 75% of the book.  King is a great writer who really knows how to put words together and gives a lot of attention to character development.  He clearly put some thought into the question of what scares the crap out of people . . . the answer being dark places and spooky clowns.  His problem is that he slows down the action to a crawl at times, and I didn't think that everyone and everything needed a back story.<br /><br />I'm sorry to say that I disliked the last 25% of the novel.  It became a lot more like science fiction than horror.  Maybe it's even religion.  The Turtle and \\"It\\"?  Supposed to be like God and the Devil?  Anyway, it doesn't matter because King made the truly awful decision to have a sex orgy of 11-year-old kids that is so offensive and unrealistic that I can't believe he went with it.<br /><br />ADDENDUM<br /><br />7-6-12:  I've been thinking a lot about this novel since reading it, and, because it has stayed with me, I think it deserves to have its rating bumped from three to four stars.  I've thought about it, and I think that this novel requires thinking beyond the locale of Derry because it's really about an epic battle between Good and Evil that has gone on for eternity but is being waged in Derry.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Lots of fun! My kids enjoy trying to beat my high scores. It is also fun to decide what game to play next.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome what ever you do I recommend this app to every person in the world so get it.
0307887898|5.0|I'm just about done reading it for the first time and very excited to apply these principles to a project I'm currently working on. I imagine I'll end up reading this book many times over.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I love this app. it lets you connect with friends but don't bother with the $1.99 version all you get is a couple hundred coins. I don't like how the color packs cost so many coins. Either the game should change the cost or the amount of the games. everything else I great!
B005ZUR724|3.0|is really worth it to spend all that money on a stupid game like this I mean come on really
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so cool. You should deffinatly get it. It is one of the best free  games I have played. The only problem is that every once in a while it misreads my swipes.  I LOVE TEMPLE RUN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00722ZIBA|5.0|Simply stated, the high quality expected from Incognito does not disappoint with this latest addition to their outstanding collection. If you love them, you must add this to your collection. If you're not familiar with them, try it, I doubt you'll be disappointed that you did - particularly if you're an Earth, Wind & Fire fan since Incognito has a similar vibe.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game temple run is one of the best games that's my opinion I was waiting weeks so the kindle fire would get this app and now that they did I cant stop playing it!! its just so addictive
B005DF2QMC|1.0|I read reviews of this product before I bought it. I have about 100 tapes that I wanted to put on cd's and / or an mp3 player. It comes with minimal written instructions. One reviewer had said as long as you are comfortable playing around on the computer you can manage this product. Well, I can play a little but not nearly enough. I hooked it up to my computer and loaded the first side of a tape onto my computer. Everything went just fine. I turned the tape over to load the second side but it loaded the second side on top of the first side. From the speakers I could hear both sides at the same time. There was no help to tell me what I was doing wrong. For me this was a waste of money.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect and free free free free free free free free free free free free free magic puzzle is the best!!
B0086700CM|5.0|Love this game. Downloaded  it at the suggestion of a friend and have been playing almost non stop since  I got it.
B005DOKM9M|5.0|I received my sleeve today, and I love it.  I read a lot of reviews saying there is a horrible smell coming from the case, but I actually stuck my nose inside it, and could hardly smell anything at all.  Of course, most cases have some sort of a smell that goes away in a few days.  I assure you, this smell is not assaulting at all, like earlier reviews have stated.<br /><br />With this sleeve I am not concerned with putting my Fire into my purse and getting scratched or broken now.  I would recommend it to any of my friends that get or have a Fire.
B006ZCWTXS|5.0|I LOVE THIS ALBUM. Rebecca is definitely starting off strong with \\"Heaven.\\" Perfect soul sound for fans of Adele, Amy Winehouse, Macy Gray, etc. But a lot like Aretha, Patti, Nina Simone, etc. Just stumbled on this clip of her doing \\"Glitter and Gold\\" LIVE. (that's on the album too; track #2). She sounds/looks/is AWESOME. [...]
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great value, great story. The first book is gripping - you can't put it down. The second much less so, but just enough to get you to finish it. The third has twists and turns in it that can 'blow your mind'! Well worth it. However, this book seems to be aimed at teens/tweens and some of the violence, direct and implied, might be too much for some of the younger ones.
0345803485|2.0|Just finished reading this book over the weekend...I wanted to see what everyone was talking about! Now I know.<br /><br />I'm just an ol' bean-counter, and certainly no literary critic. And from what I've read of others' reviews, I guess if you are going to be an author in today's world, you had better have a VERY thick skin, because there are definitely a LOT of literary critics out there. And while I don't know very much about the publishing industry or its inner workings, I have an idea that, while a book may begin with one person--the author--it ultimately becomes the finished product that has been shaped by many people, including editors and proofreaders. Is it not the responsibility of those people, to an extent, to suggest changes that will improve the quality of the author's writing? In other words, if a book is lousy, is it only the fault of the author, or does everyone involved deserve some of the blame as well? If the writing is SO bad that it can't be improved appreciably, then how does the book get published at all? Maybe that's what other reviewers here are really complaining about.<br /><br />Having said that, I do agree with a lot of the reviews I have read. Character development wasn't great; diction wasn't the most sophisticated or lyrical I've ever seen. I don't particularly care for the first-person voice, and I like it even less in the present tense. A lot of the time, I felt like I was reading Ana's diary. It resembles stream-of-consciousness, only is a little better organized.<br /><br />Some lousy editing: \\"sandles?\\" Really??? Even Words with Friends won't accept that word...and that thing accepts a lot of words that I KNOW aren't words! I don't even think it qualifies as a British spelling...my husband was born in England and lived there until he was 5, and he'd never heard of the word. I didn't catch punctuation errors that others mentioned, but I'm lousy at punctuation. I'm sure there are other errors that I glossed over, because in general, editing and proofreading these days is down the toilet, IMHO. It's gotten to the point where a lot of times, I don't even notice it.<br /><br />Some other things that didn't make much sense to me: (1) a college kid today with no laptop and no e-mail address? I work with girls who are in their 20's and who are in college part-time or have just graduated, and according to them, a laptop or computer is a requirement, much like a typewriter was for me in my college days (I'm in my 50's); (2) A multibillionaire who has his Man Friday go out to buy perfectly-fitting underwear and clothing for his sub-in-training, but doesn't have him stop at Walgreen's and pick up an extra toothbrush for her? I told that one to my husband, and he about barfed. We've been married for almost 10 years, and if I even look at his toothbrush, he's grossed out. I'm sure there were other inconsistencies, but those are all I can think of right now.<br /><br />Now, a note to others who think the author got her geography of Washington State wrong: I thought so, too...until I got out my atlas. At first, I thought, \\"Hmm, I didn't know there was a Portland WA.\\" Then something made me realize that no, we were in or near Portland OR. Wait a minute, that's SOUTH of Seattle. But Vancouver is NORTH of Seattle, in Canada. OK, I'm confused. Let's go to the map. Aha! There IS a Vancouver WA; it's across the Columbia River from Portland OR. And there is indeed a branch of Washington State University in Vancouver. I'm a graduate of the University of Arizona, which moved into the PAC-10 the year I graduated (1983), so I know that WSU is located in Pullman, in western Washington, so I thought WSU-Vancouver might be fictionalized. Nope, it really exists. So someone associated with this book did their homework in that regard.<br /><br />After all of that, reading this book was like watching a train wreck: as horrific as it was, I couldn't tear myself away. In spite of the weak character development and banal prose, I was curious to see where the two main characters would end up. If I had read this book when it was originally released last year, I would be thinking, \\"Next installment coming up...\\" Now I just have to decide if I want to wade through the next installment.se, I was curious to see where the two main characters would end up.

B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I kept waiting for them to come out with this on the kindle fire,but by the time it came out,it wasn't as popular and my friends were bored with it.I like it,but it would've been nice if they came out with it a little bit sooner
B0086700CM|5.0|I am so glad they finnaly made it for my kindle fire. this is the best game in the entire world. so fun to play.
B000KLRUJS|5.0|Yes, purchased this recording of Electra at the same time as Salome - with Solti and Nilsson and the Vienna Phil.  My 1st recording was an old 33 LP with conductor and cast long forgotton!<br /><br />Solti as a conductor is unequaled.  Nilsson is unequaled.  It would be interesting to know what these two artists thought of each other.<br /><br />When I listen to this music, another world opens for me.  I am in awe of the sound and what the digital remastering of the original has brought to life.  The vision and execution of it by Solti is the ultimate.  And the voice of Nilsson, she never disappoints or falls short.  What incredible talents and artistry these 2 have as well as the entire cast.  The sound of that Vienna Phil is beyond description.<br /><br />Puts me in another world.
B00884GR0W|1.0|this f$&amp;$ing game sucked the controls are s*** this will never beat minecraft! so don't buy it! if you think this is good your wrong!
B003JTHWJQ|2.0|My athiest friends have talked about<br />Dawkins forever. So I borrowed this to see what the fuss was about.  Couldn't finish it.
B0086700CM|4.0|I have been waiting forever for temple run to come out of the kindle but it's kind of slow and it's way harder than the iphone version.... but I still recommend it because it's still really fun!!!!! :)
B0036S4C6G|5.0|I didn't want to like this book. It's considered 'literary' - it won the Pulitzer, for goodness sake - and anything literary post-1970 (maybe before) usually means incomprehensible. Or insulting.<br /><br />I usually explain this away with the belief that most novels should have been short stories while most short stories should have been poems. maybe it's a market failure (soon I think to be rectified by ereaders) that make writers puff up decent ideas into sellable word count. Or it's ego.<br /><br />Goon Squad isn't incomprehensible or insulting. And it doesn't bog down in a swamp of verbiage and inane plot twists to pad out the word count.<br /><br />It's a relay, really, of short stories threaded together loosly by character names. A prior chapter's mention of a minor character who is now driving the narrative does illuminate that character so it isn't strickly a trick of calling a short story collection a novel. But it's not really more than a bunch of short stories.<br /><br />And I like that. Egan acknowledges that 100,000 words of a interesting record producers life and career that spans forty years of pop music is still going to be long slog.<br /><br />Oh, and another thing I liked about this piece of literature. There are stories here. Real actual stories. I'm not much past the toddler plead of \\"tell me a story\\". When an author gives it with a style (or multiple styles in Goon Squad's case) it's such a joy to read.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it I have been waiting for this game!!!! I recommend it very very very very much!!! I don't like it I LOVE!!!!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Pretty fun. It's the first time I've played a game like this. Not sure how to get acorns other then spending money though.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I thought draw something would be fun but really it wont find me any games and when it does it wont start the game.Hope this gets fixed until then.uninstalled
B003MYYJD0|4.0|The watch in the picture says SWISS on the face, and on the back. (See Product Images)<br /><br />The watch you get says \\"Swiss parts movement\\" NO \\"Swiss\\" on the face or back.<br /><br />Picture probably from original \\"Short\\" SWISS production run.<br /><br />SWISS MADE is 13 jewels gilt,  Swiss parts is 6 jewels nickle coated. Both are Ronda 5040De an excellent Movement.<br /><br />Beautiful Design, Excellent Finish.  Just know that you are buying a cheaper watch made who knows where.<br /><br />Definitly worth the $141.00 I paid for it.  No complaints really, 13 jewels SWISS MADE is worth $100-$150 more.  The difference is going to be longevity. Bushings instead of jewels.<br /><br /> I might add, this is a 2011 collection watch and the production run is undoubly over.  There appears to be only Black and Red left.  There is also Green and Blue in this series,  I haven't seen any availability on those.  That just means I haven't seen any, not that none are available.  I do a wide search before I buy. usually from AMAZON. (IF available)<br /><br />I really like the Red too.  Dated: June 4, 2012.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Addicting and movie accurate. Both me and my son play the game and look forward to getting the kindle first to play.
B0052GVGYG|5.0|This CD is great!  There is just one song that I'm not totally crazy about, and the bluesiness of the third song, Midnight in Harlem, is superb!  I have probably listened to the entire album at least 25 times at this point and don't want to take it out of the CD player.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes this style of music.
B0081OPMAA|5.0|After the first episode I wasn't sure if I would like this show. I really like Zoey D. so I thought I would give it a few more episodes. I am glad I did. This could be my new \\"friends\\", each character has their own quirks and type of humor.<br />Make sure to give it a few episodes and you won't be sorry :)
B0086700CM|5.0|awsome game its so fun love when i accomplish my objectives  ...<br /><br />and i couldnt wait for it @come out  om the kimdle fire but o think i like playing it more on yhe i phone
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a very good app and for one thing it is free. I would have bought this game if it wasn't.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I cant put it down. fun and addicting. heard about it from a friend and now I cant stop playing. I have it downloaded on my galaxy s and my kindle fire!!
1475143389|5.0|This book is great. It has good advice on nutrition and proper training. It is easy to get wrapped up in all the different workouts to do and all the different complicated strategies to gaining muscle. This book uses a simple and effective approach to building muscle, which is important to me because I hate complicated strategies that do not work. Also the author takes time to answer any additional questions you may have, which shows his dedication to helping people.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|why I like this game because. u will have a lot of fun and u are the boss. of the restaurant so that why I love the game!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007R3AZNK|2.0|Joe, I've been a fan for about 6 years and have collected most of your music, but this album is a major disappointment. Too much singing, not enough playing. If I wanted to hear singing i will put on Frank Sinatra. You are one of the best guitar players to come along in a long time just stop singing so much.
0345803485|5.0|I enjoyed the entire trilogy. Its a definite must read. Some are giving negative reviews, but I think those are people with closed minds. Understand the reasoning behind the events.
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm so addicted to this game that I fight with my 10 yr old bout who's gonna play first.  sometimes Im so into the game that I don't realize the time. My son n I like 2 see who can get the furthest n the most coins.  Its just a fun game all around. For free to, cant complain.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a really fun game. I play it all day long. there's a store that you can shop at with money you collected. at the store you can get a wallpaper or upgrades or even change charactors. I recommend this game to anyone ages 4+.
B0086700CM|3.0|Temple Run is a great game, just not for the Kindle Fire. It lags way to much and needs to be fixed by the company.
B00881VLCE|1.0|Using Kindle Fire and cannot get the final piece out of the tray.  Very disappointing as I love jigsaw puzzles.  Uninstalled
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|very interactive! lots to do. graphics are clear, and User interface is an ease.  ive never rated an app before but I harrow for this one. awesome!
0553582038|3.0|I agree with many that this book of the 5 so far was abit of a chore to get though but was interesting read for me to see a few minds that you hadn't before, namely Jaime and Cersei. But like my title said even a epic series like HP had its dull filler books, 3 and 6 if you want my opinion. yet it finished big. While Martin is in my eyes abit more accomplished than Rowling, I am sure he will Not let his fans down with the last two books. Well. I certainly hope not.... >.>
B0086700CM|5.0|kindle finally got this game,  its a very fun game!!!!! :)!!!!<br /><br />&lt;3 I hope you enjoy temple run as much as I did!!!  :p
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Having some problems purchasing extra cash in game.  Other than that love the game.  Re commend it go others.  Can be played by kids or adults. Time runs out to fast though and have to wait go lo g to refill.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|it was worth the download. very entertaining and I can play this all day if I wanted. wish they would give you more coin though
B0079R8KXG|5.0|Wonderful case, very good quality for the money. It fit the fire perfect and looks very nice. It feels very secure and I don't worry at all about it sliding out or dropping it. Try it, you'll love it.
B005PMNBNG|5.0|This album is awesome. I won't even try to get all fancy in order to explain how awesome is. I've been listening to it every day or so since purchasing it and it's still great!<br /><br />Definitely worth buying!
B0086700CM|5.0|at first I thought they didn't have temple run on the kindle but once I checked they had it I bought it and now I cant stop playing!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Amazing in 2D! Spectacular and Stupendous in 3D! All the characters come together marvelously and the interplay between them is well acted and seems genuine! I can't wait to see another!
B002KS1IJC|5.0|I'm a huge Person of Interest fan so since there are no more new episodes I thought I'd watch some movies with James Caviezel in them. Outlander was on the list and after reading many reviews I decided to rent it and although I'm not totally huge on Sci-fi flicks other than Star Wars and a few others I really liked it. There was quite a bit of blood and practically very small amounts of swearing which proves you don't need large amount of profanity to make a movie. It was VERY entertaining. I never would have expected the story line to be good if anyone explained it to me, but this is a result of great acting by the whole cast and a great story plot. Reminded me of predator, planet of the apes, and Jurassic park all wrapped into one. And James Caviezel was awesome, but I have to say he does take some odd roles in some movies. Must love the characters.

B004WKOCP8|5.0|If Not Now When is certainly different from their other albums, however different does not equal bad. If you are a fan of Incubus only for their heavier stuff, then this is probably not an album for you. Conversely, if you are a fan of Incubus for their innovative riffs and instrumentation, and a fan of Brandon's vocals and lyrics, then this is precisely the album for you.<br /><br />Brandon's voice is the cornerstone of this album. The lyrics are well-written and expressive, and his tone is powerful. The vocal harmonies are great. He has come a long way since the screaming days of SCIENCE, and has evolved as a singer (much like Anthony Kiedis, however I feel that Brandon has aged better). If you prefer the vocal style found in songs like New Skin or A Certain Shade of Green then this is probably not an album for you.<br /><br />The music for this album is somewhat minimalistic--you won't find any impressive solos from Mike or crazy bass lines from Ben, however this is not really a bad thing. We know that if they wanted to, they easily could have included both of the above, yet they did not. Instead, they created an album that is expertly orchestrated and engineered. The tones and mixing of the album are perfect, and deserves much more credit than its been given.<br /><br />I must admit, I did not like this album much when I first got it because it did not meet my expectations. Over time, however, the more I listened to it the more intricacies I found. I would hear something and think \\"Hey that was pretty neat\\". I am still finding things out about this album. It is not an album that is easy to appreciate, you really have to listen and know something about music and recording to fully appreciate this album. But if you put in the time, you will find that this album is really quite impressive. I recommend listening when you are in a particularly \\"mellow\\" mood.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app. works well on my kindle fire.  great for kids and terns.  keeps you busy. LOVE IT!!!
B0064NTZJO|5.0|If you are a fan of movies like Fast and The Furious, Drive is not for you.<br /><br />Most action movies these days are all filler and no substance. The viewer is more interested in seeing ACTION! than depth in the characters. This movie is for those of us who like a well told story with a mysterious and flawed hero, about whom we know little but can guess a lot. The interactions of the characters is interesting and tense. The characters are believable and seem real. They are not two dimensional archetypes found in most action movies. The dialogue in the movie is sparse at times, done intentionally for effect. At these times, pay attention to visual cues--the characters' faces, the blocking, etc. Also pay attention to the cinematography and use of mirrors.<br /><br />Ultimately, the negative reviews that you see are solely because people are expecting a typical action movie, which this is not. This movie would be boring to people who do not understand it. If you like the movie I also recommend the book by James Sallis, which provides much more back story than the movie.
0670022950|5.0|I read every word and found this to be one of those rare books that changes the way I think about something -- in this case violence.<br /><br />For anyone considering this book, but being put off by the length and density of satistics, may I suggest that you dip into each chapter to get the gist of Pinkers point, then read the final chapter in its entirety to get the powerful summary.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|This is without a doubt my favorite season of any show, ever! If there is one show to watch it is Dexter.<br /><br />I had heard bits of information about this show before I ever saw it--the premise of a serial killer who targets criminals sounded very intriguing. Then, a friend who had the DVDs invited me to watch the first episode. I was instantly hooked. The storyline is excellent and will draw you in--the worst part of any episode is the end, they leave you wanting more. The best part of any episode is Dexter's narration. His life is very complicated (he is a forensics geek by day and a serial killer by night ) and despite the serious tone of the show, he is comically oblivious to human emotion (because he has none). The characters are perfectly casted, they are all very believable. There could not have been a better Dexter than Michael C. Hall.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the show I also highly recommend the book series by Jeff Lindsay.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite games.  It is wonderful to have on my Kindle.  Nicely done with increasing challenge levels.  I loaded it on my 10 year old's Kindle as well and she was able to understand the concepts after doing the tutorials.  I really like that you can zoom on for the more extensive puzzles it makes the smaller boxes easier to fill accurately
B005LAIGZU|5.0|This is a great movie and a must watch for any war, action movie lover. There are going to be some people who dont like the movie, and say the acting isnt the best...these guys are SEALS not actors you need to understand that. using live amo though was amazing, great sounds.! amazon ships fast...and actually recieved it before it came out!
B005LAIHPE|4.0|I enjoyed this film. Straight off, it was fun. If you liked Transformers, or ID4, you'll like this one. It's fun, and stupid, and full of holes, but that what cheese is all about.<br />It's also a good family film, as there are no real violent deaths, or blood, or nudity, or even swear words.<br />This is not Skyline, or Battlefield LA.<br />That said, here are some spoiler questions:<br />1) How does a guy who just broke into a store, get out the next day and able to enlist in the Navy?<br />2) How does said guy, who has about the intelligence of Homer Simpson, get to lieutenant?<br />3) How can Alien Race who can travel the stars, not have a guided missile, Just mortars?<br />4) Why does a Race that prefers dark, need lights to see in the dark?<br />5) Why can they detect the insides of something, but can not detect that it's the same kind of creature that attacked before. If you killed a roach, then saw a second roach, you would know it was a roach.<br />6) If the guy can break into the satellite station to get a radio, why can he not just turn off the satellites, or redirect them?<br />7) why do the aliens carry no weapons, except a hammer/sword thing?<br />8) In the 1 hour trip to the North side of the Island, The captain on the destroyer could not take the time to lock onto the Radar dishes and destroy them?<br />9) After being fired on twice by the enemy (with major damage), the Navy ships still only fire single shots at them with their main gun. Why not open fire with everything? It is a Destroyer, right? And we see what opening fire, can do to the enemy later. Pretty effective.<br />10) Why are the enemy soldiers bulletproof, but the ships are not?<br />11) How do the aliens fit into their armor? The legs on the unit are thinner then most super models.<br />This list can go on and on.....
B004MC8CA2|5.0|lil love it super cool any time any were bo bo bo ono by ff ts Rev Cd ff ewc
B0086700CM|5.0|amazing game I play it all the time its about time they got this game for the kindle fire.  you should definitely. get this game
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I love it its the app that keeps you on track. I love it I'd give it &infin; stars cool cool cool cool
B007SYWFRM|5.0|After reading the issues some people were having with in app purchases, I simply locked my parental controls so I would know when I was being asked to make a purchase before I even opened the app. I thought the game was fun and addicting and have had no issues other than being glued to my kindle :)
B0086700CM|5.0|Its great, lots of fun.  I totally recommend it to anyone.  The one problem is its very addictive.  But still a great game.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|this app is awesome! If you go to the menu at the bottom, you can go to backup and click on it.  Then, you should have your old notes.  Finally, press for a long time and press restore
0767802519|3.0|proving the test of time I still thrill at the supreme revenge scene with the most loving gesture that confuses the mind experiencing two distinct and seperate emotions simultaneously, rare moment in cinema!  Oldman ingests these blue/yellow capsules (amyl nitrate???) and bends his body in a bizarre prequel to the real monster inside...scary, over the top, extreme, yes but what surprised me was his composure of calm once he sees his future demise and whadya know, no knife so what kind of cleaner intimacy is this??? will contemplate these deep thoughts tamara...  Natalie's portrayal of damaged tween goods is deep, tender, and full of surprises, falling in love with Leon and revenge, again the duality! Just enough insane violence punctuated with much slower relationship recovery scenes is a perfect pace to build to the grand finale... high recommend for Natalie fans (this is her phenom debut) and of course the incomparable Reno, never saw enough of him on the screen, why? Oldman has better roles i.e. Beethoven, etc., and Aiello as the owner of Guido's is a solid third lead.  Also high marks for Luc who favors green methinks and uses it generously in his films, a powerful potent color frequency.
B00846REIS|5.0|If you liked Fifty Shades then you will want to read Bared To You. Great Read. Loved Gideon's character Eva's tended to irritate me some. My only problem is having to wait until October for the next book. First time I have read anything by Sylvia Day but it will not be my last.
0465043577|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book BUT had to reread some of my notes to really get the meaning and depth of the author's point. Yes, this book is creeping up on 8 years old and truly 2008-2009 did no favors to MPT but my concern is I haven't heard anyone talking about \\" fractals\\" and I work on Wall St. My fear is that this book makes investing seem like an equation and we have seen how that works out.. it's doesn't. There are other great reviews about the small details and flaws of this theory but that is exactly the problem, investing cannot be done using formulas or select time frames that support your theory. In summary, not sure how useful this book can be to investors or money managers.
B006WWTKQ0|1.0|My nephew and niece both watched this film with me and they begged me to turned it off 30 mins in to the movie. At first I told them to give it a chance and then after falling asleep twice and having them say things like: \\"please turn it off so we can watch something that isn't so horrible!\\" and \\"this can't get any worse! This is the worst movie ever!\\", I couldn't agree more and I shut it off. I should have rented it instead if buying the 3D version. I thought it would be good because I assumed that the allegedly false negative reviews on this message board were throwing off the stars given to this film.<br /><br />I'm sorry, but it really isn't worth buying and I don't see the appeal. The songs were mediocre and the plot wasn't as \\"stimulating\\" as people are describing it to be.<br /><br />Save yourself the money and rent it first before you decide to buy it, so it doesn't end up collecting dust in your home.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I picked this one up from a book recommendation thread on one of my forums, and started reading it Saturday night - and finished it Sunday afternoon, despite being at a dog show.  The omnibus contains parts 1-5, which were independently published but fit together very nicely as a single cohesive novel.  The setting of the story is a post-apocalyptic world where people live inside an enormous underground silo of 142 levels, comprising everything needed for life - mines, generators, hydroponics, animal farms, schools, and so on.  Those who are caught breaking rules or who go crazy and demand to go out are indeed sent outside, to do a Cleaning of the sensors which show the view of the destroyed, dirty, uninhabitable poisonous outside world.<br /><br />There's not much else I can say about the story without giving away the development and twists that make this such a great read, unfortunately.  Over the course of the novel the questions of who runs the silo, what happened to destroy the outside world, and why it happened are touched upon from time to time, often in small asides that you might miss if you're not careful.  The scariest part to me was realizing the combination of a possible theory of \\"why\\" the world was destroyed combined with exactly where the silo is located - because it feels like it could be true.<br /><br />The writing of this novel is excellent and I found it to be equal to any professionally-published novel that I've read, and superior to some.  If you are at all interested in post-apocalyptic fiction, or even how tight political and sociological control structures work, I highly recommend picking up this story.
0345803493|5.0|This trilogy is AMAZING. An amazing love story that keeps you on the edge. It opens the closed doors in your heart, soul and mind.
B007SGM084|5.0|This is an easy read.  It is not for preteens or even teens.  It is a fun mind candy read to take on vacation.  I hope they make a movie.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Can play for hours,, this game is challenging yet very relaxing! Love the music in the background. Keep em coming please. Thanks
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting forever for this game to come on the kindle fire! this is an awesome game and that is why I rate it 5 stars!
B005HSL626|5.0|you should play this game all the time it is awesome and easy yo play it id a good game for all ages
B002RT69QQ|1.0|could not recommend the purchase of this product.  very cheaply made and difficult to insert card....in fact, i thought i would either break this or damage my card.<br /><br />i have thrown mine away.  i absolutely would not recommend this.  in fact, since this is my first purchase of a kingston product, i don't think i would buy anything this company manufactures.
B0023ZLI42|5.0|While the DVD that you can get to accompany this book is probably the driest, dullest presentation ever, the book is SIMPLY AMAZING! I got it about a year after I started learning guitar. In one day, I'd learned more from this tome than in the previous months combined. The CAGED system is simple to understand and will completely change your approach. After several years now of playing, I still draw on this book and always find a new tidbit that I may have missed before. If you know somebody just picking up the guitar...add this book to the package.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for this game for forever! It's even better on the kindle! The huge screen makes this game better!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Martin does an outstanding job of giving a face-lift to a genre that was once again in danger of falling flat. (I won't debate the pros or cons of the Wheel of Time or Sword of Truth series.) The rotating chapters from the various POVs show so much depth. There is a real sense of the\\"fog of war\\" here.<br /><br />BEWARE OF TINY SPOILER HERE FROM BOOK 1:<br />Also, don't think that a character is safe just because they are \\"important\\". Martin proved in book one with the death of Eddard Stark that he is not afraid to kill of a principle figure.<br /><br />This might be the best fantasy epic of the post-Tolkien era.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|101-in-1 Games is a fun way to kill time and relax. With many games so you never get bored. It keeps you challenged enough to make you want to continue playing!
B005LAIGYQ|4.0|I will be honest and say what others have already said, that the acting wasn't the greatest(though no worse than Steven Siegal, but if you can get over that, then what you have is a well done action movie with a real sense of authenticity, because the SEALS are real, as are their tactics.  It is amazing to think that what they do in the movie is what is done in real life, and it makes you appreciate those like them even more.
B0086700CM|5.0|it is a very good game and any where that I have Internet I will play it that would be my review for Temple Run
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games, a Trilogy<br /><br />This is an easy, very intertaing, read.  It holds your attention through the entire three books.  Once you start it you can't put it down.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is so awesome and u can keep playing and there are a lot of updates that u r always happy 4
0345803507|5.0|This was an amazing read. I was glad I ordered all 3 books at the same time. I finished this one in 2 days and was ready to start the next one right away.
B001676320|5.0|Excellent concert with two of the best bands in their field of music.<br />They compliment each other very well and funk the place up.
0345803493|5.0|I ordered all 3 books together, and was very happy about that decision. These books are completely addicitive. The author knows how to capture you and keep you locked in.
B00543RC0Y|1.0|To me, the price is very acceptable, though the time for shipment is nearly 3 weeks.<br />But even it provides relatively low price, I am still very upset about the damaged disk box.<br />One of the four was completely damaged on the corner. The other two with minor damage inside the boxes where the disk holder can turn.<br />I really think the owner should re-think about how to provide a proper packaging of dvds...
0345803485|5.0|The final book turned out much better than what I was expecting. You could follow the healing process of both main characters, which made these books more about sex.
0345803485|1.0|Please take your money and donate it to a useful cause. Don't buy it.  I am always curious about the best-sellers and bought it just to see what it was about. Well, after skimming the first 50 pages or so, I deleted from the Kindle.  First, it is written terribly.  My elementary school students write better.  Second, the characters are as flat as the paper the paper it was written on.  It's a sad attempt at a twisted Cinderella story.  My major objection is that this is a story about another woman who feels the need to model herself around the desires of what a man wants her to be without one thought. (Althought the author never bothered to give her any.)  There is no sexual tension, only a young woman bending to the desires of a dominate man who treats her like a child. So, there. Please take your money and donate to an animal shelter or homeless shelter. It's more useful there.
B0086700CM|5.0|i really love this app. i have been waiting and waiting for it because my friends are all in lpve with it and now it is here.
0345803493|5.0|love this book, whoever said this is porn doesn't have a sex life. Love the storyline as it continues. On the third one can't wait to see.
B004LLDN3A|4.0|Of course, what do you expect when you watch Mary Poppings.  It was just as it has always been and will always be.
0142407542|5.0|Fabulous story and illustrations!  I an an elementary art teacher and this is one of the books that I purchased for my own son,  I Love it!
B003L77G6A|5.0|The Fourth season is just as, if not more, funny as the previous Three. Great writing and acting for a sit-com. I can't wait till I can order  season Five.
0671646788|3.0|Pros: Its a decent book on positive thinking and self affirmation.<br /><br />Cons: This book does not offer a new perspective on the topic. It simply restates the current notions on positive thinking.<br /><br />Conclusion: This is good first book about positive thinking. If you have read other books on the topic, do not buy this book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like this game Im so addicted best part is it can be played by little kids too.  It keeps my niece and nephew busy when they are bored.
1582701709|5.0|I have read a few books about positive thinking and Secret is amongst the best. It's short, to the point and very motivating. I would love to re read it again every few years.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game.  I've already completed it once now I'm doing it again!! I wish there were no end to the land you can buy or how many different villages you could have, that would be better. I love it anyway the graphics are spectacular.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Good and easy read!!!  Christian Greys' life always had me wanting to read more.  An ADULT read with excitement!!!  The book starts a little slow but soon turns into a story about sex, love, dominance, and jealousy.
B0085Z8F4A|2.0|I don't generally write reviews unless something is incredibly good, or it's incredibly bad.  In this case, it's shockingly bad.  For years I have had a true admiration for Ridley Scott's work, but this is something he simply should not have signed as his.<br /><br />In terms of plot, it's basically all over the place, goes from very good, to hmmmmfff ok, to seriously forgettable.  The initial setup is reasonably good, excepting the whitish alien drinking the black goo.  That whole scene does not make any sense at all, it's irrational, illogical and has no place in the movie, not even from an artistic point of view.  The same process could have been explained or hinted at in countless other more meaningful and rational ways.  From there on, until they hit the planet the movie is quite good and manages to set up a very promising number of possible situations and occurrences (but, none of the better possibilities are used or explored).  The mid part is completely disappointing as the movie does not manage to be coherent and come together, characters are poor to say the least, they don't develop at all(except when they die, they develop into pseudo zombies), and the character set is extremely chliche.  Seriously, no one with half a brain would choose such a crew to go on an interplanetary trip that is of such huge importance.  It simply makes no sense, characters are chosen for cheap effect, and not to help sustain or enhance the movie and underlying plot.<br /><br />The iconic darkness and silence from Alien are gone, and they would have made the movie so much better. Also, the multicultural chaos from Blade Runner is not present here either.  This movie is very clinical, and way too predictable.  The rest of the movie simply unwinds itself into incongruous and irrational scenes mashed together to fill up the allotted time.  An example of some of the grossly irrational parts is : How on earth does a football sized (recently birthed) alien squid come to grow into a 30ft kraken, incredibly, this happens while its's locked inside a sealed medical room.  It logically begs the questions:  what did they feed it, or what did it feed on ???  I can understand and enjoy sci-fi movies bending or even bypassing some of physics basic rules and laws, but this is simply ridiculous.  Most of the crew is just cannon fodder, the death of Weyland is horribly lacking in creativity, the space jockey never speaks or does anything that could be deemed understandable, too many key points are simply inferred by the characters apparently from empty space with no real explanation as to how they came to that conclusion.  The space jockey in general is OK, but most of what happens is so irrational and illogical the movie seems more like a very bad sci-fi channel movie, with a bigger budget, than anything else.<br /><br />If I could I would send Mr. Scott a personal mail letting him know that this movie is simply unwatchable, not when he has Blade Runner and Alien to his credit.<br /><br />For a director that has produced arguably two of the best, if not the best two, science movies to date, this feels like going to a Michelin Star Rated restaurant only to find a Big Mac inside the cloche.  This movie is a high budget poorly thought out film that manages to seal the coffin of the Alien, and Alien related franchise.  I feel cheated and I am honestly very hurt by what has happened here, I was led to see this movie enticed by bits and pieces of clever marketing hinting at something much bigger, better thought out and that promised to the the true heir to the Ridley Scott Sci-fi legacy.  But all this was just a marketing ploy, for my money.<br /><br />I truthfully regret having seen this movie.  If you can, give it a miss, if you don't, you have been warned.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Fun and cute game! Its a plus that its free. My 3 year old daughter loves it.<br />The graphics are awesome! !!!
B005LAIHSG|5.0|Obviously a different kind of Snow White story.  Geared more for adults and teens, rather than young children.  Beautiful special effects, with some twist from the original story.  Well worth two hours of your life. Keeping this short, (I hate long boring reviews. Do people really think we read those things!!!) it was a movie worth seeing.
B0086700CM|4.0|I like it. on&ccedil;e you. get it its fun but it took a long time to download. and it slowed down the process of my entire kildle. but other then that I love it.
B005ZUR724|5.0|I have enjoyed this game from day one. there are plenty of quests to level yours solo and groups. I would suggest this to any mmorpg players.
B007SGM084|5.0|I LOVED this Trilogy. I read all 3 books in 3 days. These books had everything you could want in them. There was love, lust, suspense, heartbreak. The writer made you fall in love with Christian Grey and made you wanna be Anastasia Steele. The kind of love that they had was unbelievable and the passion was to die for.  The books were very well written and made you believe in the characters. This is definitely a set I will reread over and over again in the coming years. This was a home run!!!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|My favorite versions at the touch of a finger. The search and notes work beautifully on the Kindle Fire. A real time saver during Bible study when switching from passage to passage.
B005LAIGWS|5.0|When I first saw the trailer for this movie I really wanted to see it, but after so many bad reviews came out I decided not to see it in theaters, although I had a feeling I personally wouldn't mind what people were complaining about. Now it has shown up on PSN almost 2 weeks early and I still had some money in my account so I bought it for $5 and decided if I didn't like it oh well, it didn't really cost me anything.<br /><br />Now after seeing it I have to admit I personally loved it. It had exactly what I wanted, a lot of action and it was fast paced and to me the Ghost Rider was a lot creepier in this movie than in the first. I get why people complained about the acting, I personally only had a problem with Ciaran Hinds who played the devil. His character was very corny, but Nicolas Cage's acting reminded me a lot of how he performed in Face Off which again did not personally bother me. I also agree the kid he is protecting and his mother were not interesting characters but I was glad not only was she not a love interest but the Ghost Rider wanted to kill her, interesting take on the female character in this movie.<br /><br />I hope as this comes out on video more people see it and enjoy it as much as I did. as I stated I do understand the critisizms but if you just watch it for an enjoyable action movie and some interesting humor it is pretty good. Also I do have to agree if you try to compare this to the first movie you will be very dissappointed..or perhaps relieved that it is different, depending on your opinion of the first Ghost Rider movie.
0345803485|3.0|Everywhere I turned there was talk of this book. I finally broke down and got it, and truth be told it's lame! To sum up, insecure virgin falls hard for a rich S & M playboy who wants to sign her into contract to be his next toy, or \\"submissive\\". Personally I don't like the idea of someone having control of me besides myself, so women swooning over this puzzles me. Past daddy issues perhaps? Whose to know. Sex is everywhere in this book in graphic detail, but the writing is awful and sounds straight out of a cheese erotic novel. The idea is interesting, but overall I don't get the craze.
B000WTZ784|5.0|I think it's very under rated, in fact I think it's the best that came from Genesis I used to be a fan before & i liked we can't dance so much but i enjoyed every track on this one for me it's disappointing that this one didn't do will or else they would have made another
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The option to have the Bible read to you is a great idea! I'm following the chronological plan, which makes it easy to see the stories in a historical context and easy to understand. Definitely worth downloading!
B0061S073A|4.0|love this app. it enables my 2 year old to play my kindle without me having to worry about what she's getting into
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is very fun,awesome,cool,addicting.mathmatical,and the right game to play when you are board ,or when annoying people come over.
B007WZ7ILK|5.0|I am nearly 70 yoa. Have loved the Beachies since I was about 17, about the same time they got going. I go to their concerts when they visit Aus, unfortunetely no all together. But now. BAck as a group, absolutely awesome. I am going to miss their Melbourne concert, but I will catch them somewhere. They are that good.
B0042816YK|1.0|I'm not a prude, a chauvinist, or delusional, as my old reviews will prove. This book is irrelevant because 99.9% of men will never read it.  A 45 year old in rapid succession: divorces against her husband's pleas, rushes into bed with a new guy whom she quickly hates  Then she travels around the world, eating 10,000 calories a day without gaining an ounce, embraced by crowds of loving warm new friends, confided in and mentored by wise old men, and rushed into a 2 week sex marathon by a Brazilian stud with a heart of gold.  Yes ladies, celebrate all your crazy decisions.  A long string of male mentors and lovers will magically fix you.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I don't know what you all are talking about but I updated it a few times now and I still have all my notes nothing was deleted..... any ways this is a great app I reccommend to everyone!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game so much. It is the game I use for the waiting rooms, airports, and those long boring car rides. It really helps pass time and that's one reason why I like it so much.<br /><br />I like being challenged using multiplayer mode. Its hard but very fun. :)<br /><br />Keep making fun apps! :)
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run. I got it the first time on my ipod and then I got a kindle fire and had to wait awhile for it to be available. Then when it wad available I was sooooooo excited! People who make these apps, make apps like this, not those dumb ones about farting and happy meals. :D
B005K0HDGE|3.0|First off, I'd like to say that I love many Stephen King books and have been a fan for about 25 years.  If you enjoy Mr. King's writing style, as I do, there is much to like here.  As always, the character development is excellent and  the descriptions of the past are so rich that it feels as if you are literally transported back in time.  Also, I enjoyed meeting up with Beverly Marsh and Richie Tozier again.  IT was one of my all-time favorite King books. Unlike some, I enjoyed the premise of this story more for the idea of time travel than any great interest in the Kennedy assassination, so I wasn't disappointed that the hero's journey was really the main focus of the story. Those expecting Kennedy to be front and center will be disappointed.<br /><br />That being said, I found hundreds of pages of spying on Oswald to be incredibly boring. I skimmed through at least a third of the book to get back to the real story, which was Jake/George's relationship with Sadie, his life in the PAST, and the consequences of time travel.<br /><br />I love King.  And I love long books - as long as they NEED to be long to tell the story properly.  But King, himself, has admitted to having \\"diarrhea of the word processor.\\"  This book should have lost a few hundred pages on the cutting room floor.  I also agree with those who've complained that $17 is ridiculous for a digital file - especially one that you don't own full rights to.
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|My two year old love this zoo set. It comes with 4 critters and is a great addition to her other duplo sets. Being a durable plastic, she is able to pack them for trips or take the critters in the tub for more imaginative play!
B005HWUBZ0|5.0|I saw Mayer Hawthorne when he opened up for Bruno Mars last year.  And, I developed a bit of a crush on him after I saw him perform.  Also, the more that I listen to this album, the more I like him.  His voice has such soul and a real 50s mowtown feel to it.  This CD is really good.  Awesome, more like.  It always puts a smile on my face whenever I listen to it.  And, I am sure it will yours too.
B007G937CQ|2.0|Been a fan since day/album 1. This latest live release is good but not a necessity. I'd like to see Saxon go back to ROCK&ROLL style songs and stop with the live releases. Call To Arms was blaaahh. My only other grip about this live album: \\"F\\" this, \\"F\\" that. Too much cussing. Biff there's no need to constantly cuss and follow Ozzy's foul tongue. People will still think you're cool.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|starting to enjoy this game.  plan on referring this game to my friends. not really sure about the building's and expanding. still working on it
B004MC8CA2|5.0|One of my favorite apps.  I definitely recommend this above all other Bible apps out there.  I especially like all of the different translations and languages available.  The reading plans and devotional content are an added bonus.  There is something for everyone - whether you are new to reading the Bible or study it daily.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved this book from start to finish.  Had trouble putting I down and find myself wishing it wasn't over!
0345803493|5.0|Very good book.  Couldn't put it down, worth all the hype!  I recommend every woman read the book. Must read!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I dont understand how this has become a bestseller at all.  I hated both the main characters.  They were so stupid (on the girls part) and obviously troubled/psycho (on the guys part) that I wished they would both just run off and that I didnt have to read about what they did sexually AGAIN.  I skipped parts of the first book because I did not care about their stupid contract they were battling over.  In my mind, I just thought 'WHY is she even considering this??' because it was total bull.  Really?  The sex was SO GOOD you think it would be fun to be abused???  Come on, from someone who was a virgin and had 'never even wanted to be with a man' before?  Right.....of course, when push comes to shove (to use a bad pun), she dosnt like it.  Wow, gasp.  Then there is the  dumb ass crazy guy who is obviously obsessive and also probably doing something illegal in his company (which was very clumsily referred to several times).  And the fact that she chooses the least reliable form of birth control...hmmmmmm....could we be setting her up to be pregnant the second book??  This was all sex and no story at all.  I could read Penthouse and it would be better than this dreck.  I left the girl crying on her bed about her 'inner pain' and thought \\"Good, I hope you enjoy it\\" with no desire to read on further.  However, just FYI, I have friends who did read on.  I told them my off the cuff predictions for the next two books and hey---big surprise---I was dead on.  Thats how great these books are, you dont even have to read the second and third ones to know what is going to happen.  So if you want to read 3 books to get 3 'hot' parts per book (my average based on the first one) then go ahead.

B007HO392S|5.0|Carrie Underwood has done it again.  Her newest album, \\"Blown Away\\", hits all the right notes at the right times.  The lead single, \\"Good Girl,\\" ranks with her best songs.  The second song, \\"Blown Away,\\" may be better than the first one on the album and strokes her back to her Oklahoma home.  Having lived in Oklahoma and experienced tornado alley, her interpretations are doubled in the lyrics, meaning the wind and someone else.<br /><br />True fans will totally enjoy the album.

1594202842|3.0|I just finished the audio book and as a new parent had very mixed emotions--admiration for the discipline and work ethic of Mrs. Chua as a working mother (where does she get the time and energy?)--and sadness that so often her words to her two incredibly talented daughters were so harsh throughout the book. I wasn't as offended as others were by the work ethic and discipline that Chua imposed--I actually found her perspective of expecting strength and competency from her daughters was a really empowering perspective. Luckily for her, her daughters actually could perform at the high level their mother expected. It would have been more interesting to know how this story would have turned out if either daughter wasn't so gifted musically. Would the tiger have crumbled or raged on? But since this is a non-fiction tale, I imagine this ending would not have been so interesting for Mrs. Chua as the rather innocuous ending where she somewhat relinquishes control over her youngest daughter's music career to only discover she is a budding tennis star. Which is fine especially now that tennis is respectable Chinese sport thanks to Michael Chang. (Yes, she said this! I hope some of this is tongue-in-cheek (although her reading in the audiobook didn't belie any irony), but the racism and prejudices espoused throughout this book are startling for a well-educated, worldly Yale professor).<br />As a thought provoking book, I give this one high marks. It has clearly sparked a debate. As a book, I'd say it's mediocre--I don't think that the author has enough perspective to provide good insight into the story she tells. It is also rather anecdotal and meandering. I'm glad I read it so I'm more informed on the debate around the book, but this is not a book I'd read again. I have no intentions to wholeheartedly adopt the methods Mrs. Chua used in raising our daughter, but I will keep in mind some aspects of her perspective especially around hard work, discipline and focus--and that instilling these traits is not easy. And that it is important to be a parent--not a friend--which is also not easy.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|While this story is a disturbing one, the author does a masterful job writing in this child's voice.  Readers will be transformed as they see the world through a young boy's eyes.  Hightly recommended read!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read a lot of books, including a lot of science fiction, and this ranks right up among the best I've read. All the extra gushy positive reviews are basically right on the money. I picked this up more or less on a whim (and because of all the gushy reviews), and the characters/story hooked me from the very beginning. I had a hard time putting it down for the next 2 days till it was done.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this game is off the hook u should play it u will love it ;) get it today or when ever
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|(May contain spoilers)<br /><br />My fellow Amazon folks, stop right there.  Stop falling for hype.  Stop thinking Prometheus is related to the Alien franchise.  Stop expecting ANYTHING from this title.  That is the problem we seem to be having:  the hype and expectations.  We've all done it now and then.  You know, get drawn into trailers and think the film will be like that.  You think we would have learned by now, but we never do.  That simple little fact that trailers are rarely, if ever, are what the movie will play out.<br /><br />Blink away trailers, cast/director interviews, and random rumor mills.  Walk into this film with open eyes.  Expect nothing and get your head in the mindset that this is a stand-alone Sci-Fi film, not connected to any other film.  Do that and you will enjoy it more.  Any attempts to connect it to Alien franchise or fall for the trailer hype and the film will be ruined.<br /><br />Now, if you walk into this as a stand-alone film, it isn't that bad.  Yeah, some things don't make sense like why super intelligent being would act so simplistically or how a football sized critter grows to huge proportions without a food source.  But, it is a Sci-Fi film we are talking about.  We have to roll the dice and let some things slide.  No one watched Jaws and got hung up on how the shark got to the island, after all, right?<br /><br />Is it an instant classic?  Nope.  Is it the worse thing ever captured on film?  Of course not.  It is a nice, middle of the road film that is a good way to kill just over 2 hours, with trailers.  Take it for what it is, not what the trailers claimed it would be.<br /><br />Hope this post saves some folks a bit of heartache.  Enjoy.

0345803485|5.0|I cannot even put into words how much I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this series.  I have read all three books and in record time and I even read them over again, I cannot get enough of the series.  I hope the Author is planning on releasing the other books from his point of view soon because I'm dying for my fix of Mr. Grey.  I recommend purchasing all three books in the series at the same time because you will be hooked and waiting for shipping feels like forever even when you get it in two days.  I absolutely loved these books like no other!!!!

B000068G5F|5.0|By the Way has been one of my all-time favorite albums since it was first released. The only concern I ever had with it on other formats was that I could never find a true high quality version. Getting it on vinyl solved that, as this format is extremely high quality and has given By the Way new life in my daily music rotation.

1594201927|1.0|Wow, Mr. Ferguson shows how little he actually does know about financial history. I tried, I really did, but there was so much garbage -- statements based on common misapprehensions originated by ignorant people in the first place -- that I had to just give up. It makes me want to vomit at the number of intelligent people who are actually reading and listening to this (and watching the worthless PBS series). What a joke. I wonder if he only put his name on it and had underlings do the work, or if he really is this ignorant? Any expired economic textbook is more informative and accurate than this.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really like this app. I can choose may translation, select a reading plan, highlight meaningful passages in the color of my choice, journal my reactions, and set a reminder for the next day's reading. This makes my Bible reading the best experience possible. Love this app!

B001AXOFS4|1.0|I purchased this CD via seller Megahit Records, Inc. on Amazon.<br />I was expecting a good quality US print CD, but I when I received it, I realized that the CD was printed in Taiwan.<br /><br />I have nothing against a Taiwanese print CD, but personally I would have preferred and was HOPING to receive a USA print CD since I ordered from Amazon USA.<br /><br />In short, I am quite disappointed with the vendor, which made no attempt to inform the buyer that the item was not manufactured in the US.<br />If you are looking for CDs printed in the USA, you might want to reconsider purchasing from them.

0061692042|3.0|I know Richard Ford is a Pulitzer Prize winner, but to me this novel was just adequate at best. I have to admit that this is the first novel I have read of his, but I expected more after reading the reviews of his 'The Bascombe Novels' . A John Irving he's not. The story was okay, but I don't know if the matter was relevant. And why does Ford tell the reader what's going to happen many chapters before the event actually happens? I like to fall into these unexpected predicaments and marvels without the author providing his own 'spoilers'. I'm not complaining because I did somewhat enjoy the story, I just think it could have been a whole lot more nail-biting. Two positive points relating to the author's style are the disambiguation and resolution of the novel.<br /><br />The narrator and lead character is Dell Parson, the fifteen year old son of bank robbing parents. I'm not giving anything away, since Dell tells the reader on the first page! This is the story of a Montana child and his escapades for the next fifty years of his life till the present year of 2012. Dell has a twin sister that leaves home shortly after the bank heist and is hardly heard from again. Most of the tale involves the Saskatchewan area of Canada, where Dell winds up after also leaving home. He is taken in by a nefarious gentleman named Arthur Remlinger, a former trouble maker from the U.S.A., and supervised by the brackish Charley Quarters. This part of the novel is the most salient section in this humdrum story.<br /><br /> I don't want to give away any of the remainder of the story since the author will do so himself as you read the book. I don't hold this book as an important work, but would recommend it anyway because of the stature of the writer. I know Mr. Ford lives in Maine, does he have three way conferences with John Irving and Stephen King? Can you imagine, wouldn't you want to be a fly on the wall? I opine that reviewers have to realize that Richard Ford is a former sportswriter and not Charles Dickens.not Charles Dickens.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is addictive, and definitely not a waste if time!! I was happy when I found out it was FINALLY on kindle fire, and its FREEE!!!!!
B00634GHJA|2.0|No longer works after ICS update. FC once connected to wifi. Much better options are out there. Dropbox,  and the addition in Bump to transfer pics via a browser works great.

B0042P2VLU|2.0|I felt like the story line was compromised by not have any narraration to explain the storyline which is highlighted by the use of the musical instruments.  I was very disappointed.  The older versions are better.

B0086700CM|5.0|Great game ever.  Who ever is reading this you should get this app.  You won't be disappointed with this choice.
0345803485|5.0|I read all 3 books on a 4 day weekend. Very addicting. Shocking at first, but as the story goes on you get attached to Fifty. This is a book worth keeping and rereading several times.
B000N2HCKQ|4.0|This was an excellent book. If you are in any kind of position where you deal with people I strongly recommend you read this. There are plenty of useful tools that you can apply not only to your professional life, but personal as well.
B005C9YZIW|5.0|Jaw-dropping. Must be seen to be believed. Makes other nature photography pale by comparison. Each episode is of the same level of quality. The making-of features are also pretty interesting.
0345803493|3.0|Ok although I'm only half way through the second book I have to ask, \\"sexwhere are you?\\"<br /><br />Now there are a few scenes all vanilla as far as I'm concerned. YAWN.<br /><br />So far its mostlt about his ex subs and their stalker mentality.. which I actually like! Finally some drama and thrill in this series! Then things take an odd turn..<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT... christians subs all look like his crack whore mother..LOVELY..nothng turns me on more. Thats a joke.. insert sarcasm.<br /><br />I just don't get it.. Christian all of a sudden turns submissive to anna, WHAT? he bows before her? WHAT? ughhhhh I find it unbelieveable that he is soo into this chick. I mean unless she looks like a young angie jolie.. I don't see it. I'm not beliving this story anymore.. she lost me.<br /><br />Now I'm halfway through so I will see what happens.. but if this is what gets off married women in america I really feel bad for you!!!!! Have the sex acts and plain and simple.. most women experimented in their early 20s. I haven't seen anyting new and exciting yet...<br /><br />I will post again once I'm done.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|The end of my cable came apart too.  Unfortunately for me I purchased my Kindle from Amazon.com as they were not available in Australia at that time.  Now, they are telling me that the are unable to send me a replacement as they cannot ship to Australia.  Strange, a cable came with the original order, so how come they could ship it then.  Have offered me a promo to spend on other accessories, but hey I DO NOT WANT any other accessories, just the replacement USB cable.  Not very happy!! Oh, and by the way, it is still under warranty.
0061733199|4.0|This book covers nearly any type of situation that can arise.  It covers how to trap, clean, and cook animals and gives several options to construct a fire.  If you are lost in the wilderness with a knife and this book you will do just fine.  That being said, information is great, but most of the stuff in the book becomes much easier with practice.

B0086700CM|5.0|This is one of the coolest, yet simplest, games I have ever had to play. I think that everyone should try this game at least a few times.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a fabulous book. I loved this story and it was very well written. It kept me engaged until the last page.
1466401885|5.0|After recently finishing the Fifty Shades Trilogy, I was looking for something to take away the sour taste left in my mouth from those books. I just wanted to find a gripping but simple love story and somehow I stumbled across Beautiful Disaster. What this eventually lead to was some major sleep deprivation but a mighty good time! A lot of the previous reviewers covered most of the basics-yes there are some typos, but otherwise I found this to be an excellent read.
B006LRUVUA|5.0|Love it. This app is much better than Show my PC or any other remote access tool that I've used.<br />I have it on iPhone, Kindle Fire, laptop and home PC. Works great on all of them.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|What a series!! This is the 3rd and final book and it did not disappoint. There was more depth of story in this one and the transformation in characters and pleasant surprises made this great. I am sad to see it end, as with any good series. I took my time reading this to savor every bit. All questions from the first 2 are answered. Kudos to Ms. James on an opening to her writing world. *****5stars.
0231161166|5.0|This is one of those books that introduces an entirely new and fascinating topic. A similar work would be [[ASIN:0143113453 Chaos: Making a New Science]] which introduced the concepts of chaotic dynamical systems at a time when even many practitioners of the sciences would not have heard of it.<br /><br />Similarly, this book introduces the discoveries in epigenetics (epi- meaning \\"on\\", or a layer on top of classical genetics) and pretty much all of this will be new information unless you have been actively working in the field of cell biology over the past few years.<br /><br />The book talks about the paradigm shift that is occurring as cell biologists are realizing that this epigenetic information is as complex and important to the correct function of life as the underlying DNA genome, and even allows for Lamarckian inheritance in certain cases where an offspring's own epigenetic information and phenotype can be influenced by that of the parents, meaning that some environmental effects in a parent's life can directly influence future generations.<br /><br />Also much of the non-protein-coding genome that for many years was considered to be unimportant \\"junk\\" is now turning out to be very important as it can be transcribed into functional RNA molecules that perform important functions. The book contains a simple graphic showing that the ratio of the non-protein-coding DNA to that of traditional protein coding genes increases in direct proportion with the complexity of the organism. The fundamental genes and proteins between say a chimpanzee and a human are virtually identical and it now begins to look as though it's that \\"junk\\" DNA that makes all the difference.<br /><br />This is a fascinating look at recent developments in the ever-accelerating biological revolution and I highly recommend it to everyone who yearns to understand how life works.<br /><br />G.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|This is wonderful - I used to have a Sky Caddie, then went to a Callaway uProGo.  This is far superior - no errors in the yardage and get it right to the pin.  Small, convenient to carry and use - Love it!!

B007BVOF8E|1.0|Ok...I don't care about daggers that much, but I was totally lost and the movie ended with me still trying to figure it all out.  If there was a climax I missed it.  I'll take 'The Good Shepherd' any day over this one.  The Good Shepherd had a plot you could follow - connect with, and had no more daggers than this one did.
B0086700CM|5.0|i love this game i give ot three stars cause i just love it i could not live without it

B0000508U6|1.0|I know this group has been around for over a decade, but they are new to me.  I'm exploring their albums and have listened to 4 of their other albums.<br /><br />I really like the others except Parachutes which sounds like Dave Matthews on Valium is doing all of the vocals, and there's not much variety in the songs.  Same thing over and over.  Nothing moves very far.  If you like the first song, you'll like the rest of it.<br /><br />If you're a Dave Matthews fan, you might like this one. If you're not, then skip this record.  The critics and a a big majority of Amazon reviewers liked it.  Listen to it yourself and decide.
B0086700CM|4.0|it would be more fun to play against friends.Like a race against an opponent.(to see who can go longest without dying)  other than that its a five star rating<br />thx again :) :D
B000002KOJ|5.0|This was an \\"Amazon format-update\\" of an old and dear friend: I've enjoyed the vinyl version of this album for longer than I'm about to admit.  (I am old; I have seen.)  If your musical taste favors singer/songwriters with real stories to tell, Joni Mitchell can do that very well!  When she's bright and spunky, she's dynamite; be mindful that many of her lyrics could send you right over the railing on the bridge if you're having a low-down, bluesy-bad day!  (Many of her song titles, or at least packaging for her albums, should be labeled, WARNING: These lyrics can be dangerous to precarious mental health.\\")  It often seems that J. Mitchell rarely knew love and joy, but then here comes \\"Chelsea Morning,\\" and she blows my theories to pieces!  (The song reportedly provided Hillary and Bill Clinton a first name for their daughter!)  The title song, \\"Clouds\\" and the melodic \\"Both Sides Now,\\" complete the \\"greatest hits\\" from this album, and assure me that at least part-time, Ms. Mitchell saw life whole, and well...
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it its awesome I play it in the car and in bed at night I play it everywhere in school during lunch and at the park everyone should get this game
B000002KOQ|5.0|If I had to describe amazon.com in two words, \\"fabulous deals\\" would do it; Joni Mitchell in two words requires hyphenated words count as one word, or I'll take my toys and go home!  \\"Dynamite-lyrics\\" would be one word, and \\"haunting-melodies\\" the other!  (Just don't ask me to rate her paintings -- to each of us his own.)  It's grand to get this long-owned album in \\"new and improved format,\\" and especially with my vinyl in \\"hating-it\\" condition, just \\"played to death.\\"  \\"Greatest hits\\" on this album include \\"Big Yellow Taxi\\" and \\"Woodstock.\\"  (\\"Morning Morgantown,\\" because I said so!  Once you know it, just try to pry this melody out of your head, then you'll know why I do!)
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its ok I have played better. but its good when you are bored and have nothing better to and its really fun
B00783NWB6|3.0|Another blast into the blue tinged Underworld that we've come to know as this franchise is slowly milked to death. Shot for 3D using Red Epic cameras, this is the best looking of the four movies, and script/action wise better than 2 or 3. Kate still looks great in full leather, but don't expect any surprises outside the genre.
B00846REIS|3.0|If you've read Fifty Shades then get ready to read a book that is very familiar.  So familiar it will make you think the author borrowed from Fifty Shades.  Similarities are striking and sometimes irritating.  Easy read that will keep your attention, but nothing original.

B0024FAR5W|5.0|Great action for bikers or for those who just love the lifestyles. Wonderful casting, great directing ...so much packed into this series.  Makes you want to go out and get some wind therapy!
B001RTSPVY|5.0|I like it, especially being able to watch it at my own pace, without commercials.<br />not watching much tv, I cannot compare it to anything else.  It does stand on its own.<br />What's to say that hasn't been said, I like the connection to the real world, as in, this could happen.  it brings out some great points on things to think about, like health insurance in the usa.  One stretch on realism is that everyone I know in teaching has very good health insurance.  Another thought provoking topic is dealing with cancer.  I am learning a few things about it, and dealing with my friend's cancer helps me to consider things that she is going through, and how to accept and respond to her fears and situation.  The entertainment part of it is great, a chemistry high school teacher and his real life application of his knowledge, and how he adapts and handles his problems. Lots of side stories brought in for a well diverse story all around the central story, such as the petty theft by Walt's sister in law, the turtle in the desert,  Walt Jr and his cerebral palsy, even the lawyer,  lots of things for consideration.<br />A what could be look at a real life side of illegal drugs, what it does to a person, family,... especially Jane, Jane's father,  as well as the business side of it, especially Jesse's street friends.  an intelligent main character, Walter, and cast, written by intelligent writers, put together and presented in an entertainingly intelligent way.
B007C4ZJ0S|1.0|A stupid movie with bad dialogue, acting, storyline and music. The start of the of movie was good, it had some good fighting scenes and then our main character Mallory Kane somehow enchants a boy to drive away with her in his car. So the story begins here, the boy asks questions about why she's being attacked. The flashback begins as Mallory Kane explains the story to the boys about her adventures in Europe and how her company double-crossed her. Basically after her story, the boy just leaves the story.  There were a lot of chase scenes which i think were just too long and it doesn't help that it's accompanied by cheesy jazz music. The dialogue between characters were just dry and boring and I'm sorry but the character who play Mallory can't act. The action scenes were cool but executed as if they were still in training. We don't find out who the real bad guys are until near the end of the movie. Mallory has made it her life's mission to hunt down her boss, Kenneth, after she realized he set her up. But instead of telling us, how she tracked him down, they showed a scene of Kenneth on the beach and Mallory on the side of beach just running up to him to beat the crap out of him. I mean what the hell, how did she find him, where was he, and how did she know he was on the beach. The movie included so many detailed chase scenes in the beginning but when it came to the most important one they just skimped out. If your looking for a spy movie skip this one, it's just awful.

0470876417|4.0|Great book. Very easy to read. Clear explanation of each item. Must be read for all entrepreneurs. Teach in a very intuitive way,about how to organize your mind to solve the challenges of innovation,with practical methods and techniques to make it real.
B00447L4JG|5.0|I looked everywhere for this dvd could not find it anywhere except for here on Amazon.com. My son asked me to give this movie to him for his birthday. I ordered it, I recieved in time for his party. It was one of the best presents he opened, he was so excited, it is one of his favorite films. He wants to be Jack for Halloween this year. Thanks Amazon for carrying this hard to find movie.
B000002V1D|5.0|at the time this came out.  my husband died.  i listened to it blasted ordinary life till my 3 room mates told me no dont play it again. i lost it and with that i lost memories.  that is all I had left of him.  found out amazon had it used, that way i saved money and could get next day shipment.  and  the music is bitter sweet but i now hear the sweet.  it helped in a bad time in my life
B0072X2NUS|5.0|If you like Techno, Dance and Electronica music, you will love this album. If you only buy this because you are DM and Erasure fan, maybe this is not for you.
B000ID37RM|5.0|Of course it goes without saying that this is a classic --- one of the best movies of all time!  I teach this book in my reading classes at a community college, and it is very convenient to be able to order the movie as a digital download and bring it right up on the PC in my classroom to show on the projector.  I often misplace things and forget things, so having to remember to bring a DVD to class would just add to my stress.  I might forget it, and then I would end up having to change my lesson plans and disappointing my students.  This is so much easier!
B0086700CM|3.0|title says it all. lags way too much!! it is just way too slow for me and it really annoys me. please fix asap
B00846REIS|5.0|I am a huge Fify Shades of Grey Fan and thought that there is no other book that could compete with the originality of this book, however Bared to you is a keeper and a must read, though there are some similarities to Fifty Shades, this book definitely stands on it's own. Gideon and Eva are my new two favourite characters. I will not divulge a lot of info regarding the book, however I  must say you have to get your copy and it's a definite read again for me.
0345803485|1.0|This was a total waste of money. Worse I knew a little about what it was about and still bought it. I didn't finish it. I am not a prude but I don't find this type of relationship healthy or desirable. No caning for me. Even the initial love making wasn't arousing. It reminds me of the old Anne Rice (she used a pseudonym) erotica. Like this book, they were not erotic. Also it is poorly written and the characters are shallow.<br /><br />I wish I could get my money back. It only has a star because they made me. How do I delete it from my purchases?
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I got this as the free App of the day at a friend's suggestion. It is a fun logic puzzle that I find I can play when I have just 5 or 10 minutes to spare. The problem is that those 10 minutes suddenly become half an hour.<br /><br />I'm glad I got the app for free, but I would pay a couple of bucks for it now.
B00884GR0W|3.0|I might cpnsider getting this game all of my friends play eden and say how good it is is this game more.like eden or the suckish minecraft pe

0345803507|1.0|This trilogy is by far the worst books I have EVER had the misfortune to read. I actually bought into the hype for the first time in my life. what a mistake!!! the characters in this book are the most obnoxious and stupid characters you could imagine. I kept hoping they would all die! Don't waste your time and money, these books suck!!!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|while i think this trilogy is well written, its extremely oversexed. i dont understand the popularity. morely likely its from sparking dormant libdos than literary genius. ive read better, sorry.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Some games i love and others i hate but its a fun game to pass the time. I love it more than hate it lol.
B0081KTI0E|4.0|This was not a perfect movie. The pacing was odd with a very slow drawn out beginning and an all too abbreviated finish. Almost as if the director decided the he needed to wrap the movie up quickly after some point. There was much that could have been done to prolong the suspense and foreshadow the conclusions. The ending had a slight Disneyesque feel to it that I didn't like. I almost expected animated birds to pop out singing.<br />That said this is a movie worth watching (but not alone). I do not get frightened very easily but this movie scared me to pieces. Daniel Radcliffe was very much able to step beyond Harry Potter in this movie and I am impressed by that. His facial expressions, vocal tone, and responses were very unique to the character and allowed him to become immersed in the role. C. Hinds is an outstanding actor and does a fabulous job here too. I would recommend this movie to anyone but it could be too intense for smaller children. Also because children are the victims in this movie it could be traumatizing  to younger viewers.
B0086700CM|4.0|I love this game and I cant stop playing but the lag is getting really bad! please fix because its making me want to play less and less due to the large amount of lag.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book, although, graphic & am looking forward to reading Book Two & Book Three, which I have already purchased.
B0086700CM|5.0|this app is the most fun app ive ever played. you show totally get it since its free. I love it because you can try to beat your own score. get it!
B000U0F7RG|5.0|This is by far my favorite show ever. I have literally watched every single episode at least 5-10 times! I actually ordered this from overstock.com. it was a little cheaper, but I see that since I ordered it the price on amazon has gone down. I received it today, and am not entirely pleased with the condition. The box it came in was in very rough shape. The case with the dvds has a couple small scratches, but it shouldn't interfere with the function so I didn't return it, but I'm babbling, as that is a criticism of usps not the product. The case is a lot more space friendly than the individual seasons, and quite cute in my opinion. I had read reviews on here that the dvd holders are cheap and flimsy, but they aren't as bad as some made it sound. I will be watching each disc to make sure they all work as I have also read that many customers received faulty discs, but as long as they are all in working order, I couldn't be happier with my set! Such a great show and well worth the investment if you are a diehard fan such as I am!
B0086700CM|2.0|u never stop running I cant figure it out. its so darn hard to achieve I don't like playing this game.

B000K8IDF6|4.0|What can ya say about Sticky Fingers that hasn't been said already? It's a great album. They had a little more time to work on this one & they were at their peak, it shows. This original CD mix sounds good in my opinion. That said, I owned all these Stones CDs prior to the 94 Virgin remasters coming out so this is what I'm used to them sounding like. I'd love to hear from people that have compared both remasters (1994 & 2009) to this original CD. I'm wondering if an upgrade is needed or not.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is awesome on Kindle Fire! It's big.. clear.. and great quality! I recommend you to get and play this game if you didn't have a smart phone.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Free and hours of fun! Highly recommended! I have not had any of the freezing problems either and I have played it for a long time.
0525478817|5.0|I loved this book!!  It is a beautiful story of teenagers struggling with cancer and all its side effects while also going through normal ups and downs of growing up and falling in love.  It couldn't put it down and read it in a day.  And of course...there were tears.
0345803485|1.0|I really wish that I could get my $30.00 back after reading these books.  I did finish them, only because I had already paid for them... but I was bored with them.  I kept waiting for something to happen, and it never did.  Like many others, I was very tired of the repetetive nature of the \\"plot\\".  I would not recommend spending money on these books.
B007HO392S|2.0|look i give her the benefit she has gotten married. but besides 2 songs the cd was poor. i would wait till shes settled down and knows that music is her life not marriage
1567184855|3.0|I have to give the book a thumbs-up for the author's approach.  He's probably as close to scientific and investigative as you're going to find in this genre and given the time-sensitive nature of his interviews.<br /><br />However, for someone who does seem to believe in a spiritual world, I found the author suprisingly lackadasical about a few things that would see a bit pressing for one familiar with the literature of quite a few of the major world religions.<br /><br />1. The tone of the interactions: the \\"guides\\" are, in some cases, threatening to leave if he \\"asks too much.\\"  They're stand-offish and secretive. I can find some \\"interactions\\" with the spirit world in exorcism literature that takes that tone.  But I can't find anything in the Bible, Torah, or Q'ran that takes that tone. Messengers from \\"the One\\" don't play coy - they show up, say what they're saying, clarify what they can, and move on.  It doesn't prove anything, but something was off.<br /><br />2. The next sign that something might be a bit off was the approach to evil and hell. Everyone seemed extremely lackadasical about human suffering - it's apparently something we all choose for the purpose of growth - prior to returning to earth. Additionally, rather than providing some measure of explanation for the concept of hell, or attempting to reassure / soothe / remove fear about it, it's simply dismissed.  This does nothing to explain the NDE accounts out there (or the stories one can hear from friends working in hospice for decades) that would seem to point in that direction. Certainly, if its not serving people to believe in hell and if so many souls are laboring under that much fear and terror because of that belief, wouldn't it be one of the first ones to debunk?<br /><br />Also, if there is no real evil in the afterlife, then - as we can all agree that some of the things we see here are quite \\"evil\\" in appearance - either humans are already \\"creators\\", we're just creators of evil.  Which isboth an ability that would seem to exceed our spirit abilities and one that would make us rather unredeemable, as our \\"goodness\\" and other skills/abilities aren't THAT impressive from a spiritual perspective.<br /><br />The alternative view is that we recognize goodness by its comparison to evil.  Where there is no evil, good isn't \\"good\\" - it's just normal, average, typical state of being.  But no one acts as if good is anything but the \\"good\\", better state of being that we see it as today.  Doesn't add up.<br /><br />3. Anyone raised in a religious setting is accustomed to the idea of any \\"messengers\\" from \\"the Source\\" to humans being big name droppers.  They're mentioning God as their source of the info, as the giver of whatever message they're delivering, etc.  There's plenty of God discussion, which makes sense if that is the center of everything, the ultimate goal, etc.  But here, there's distinct reluctance to use the name \\"God\\" - they'll use any other name under the sun, but even come right out and say, \\"We don't like to use that name\\" when he asks why they're calling God something else (props to the author for questioning some of these statements when the vast majority of books in the genre wouldn't).  That's a big red flag.  We're advised to \\"test the spirits\\" within quite a bit of religious literature and none of that's happening here.  If there is an evil or deceptive spirit out there, there's zero protection in terms of determining whether what's \\"coming through\\".<br /><br />4. The spirits explanations of finding the body and their detachment in when to join, how long to stay, etc., roaming the solar system, etc. echoes a lot of the literature of major religions around the behavior of \\"demons\\" or \\"satanic\\" entities.  But since we didn't do a lot of investigation around #2, there didn't seem to be much of a platform to work from here.  And again, given the tone of the communications, perhaps that was the only way to get this much material. I can't say that its untrue - I don't know, and don't think any of us do - but it was edgy and out there and I'd have been interested in a bit more investigation there.<br /><br />I also find it a bit off-setting that, since we don't know a lot of details about his subjects' current lives, we're attributing most tendencies now to past lives.  For example, just because you like to hunt doesn't mean that you were a great member of a hunting tribe in the Amazon around 400 b.c. when a more logical explanation would be that your \\"current\\" father took you hunting every year from the time you were 3 as parent-child bonding time.  It would be interesting to see if there were \\"current\\" life ties to some of these tendencies, and more controls for alternate influcences and explanations.<br /><br />I finished the book convinced that the \\"voices\\" of the spirits were not reincarnations, but deceptive sprits of some sort or another.  Too much that didn't add up.  Still, a fascinating read.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love these books. This is one of the best series I have ever read. A good combination of action and love.

B005I6EU7U|4.0|When I first saw it I felt in love with it. Its a good looking touch for a great piece of technology such as the Kindle Fire.<br />It's like viewing an old book. Feels good when you handle it, just like holding your favourite old book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really enjoy the solitaire app.  it is so much fun.  it has a lot of flexibility.  cant get get enough.
0345803485|1.0|Was this book even edited??? One sentence says, \\"He owns a back\\" don't you mean he owns a BANK? If you can get past the terrible verbs, misused words, and slow pace this book isn't half bad. I just want to know why did it drag out into 3 books? One book could have told the entire story if the author didn't spend 10 pages on one scene. We get it Grey is beautiful, Ana is insecure! Remember this was done before in twilight. Thank God I read a free copy of this book and didn't pay. If it becomes a movie I will pay to see it. Hopefully the movie will make up for what the book lacks.<br /><br />If you are on a tight budget, don't spend your money on this you will be Pissed!
0345803485|3.0|I am getting this for my wife. She says its a good read. Its a great book to have for Summer
B002P79KAC|5.0|This show is so much fun! I started watching it during season 5 and had to go back and buy the previous seasons.
B007C4ZJ3K|3.0|Soderbergh is clearly out of his element with a straight action piece.  While there are some good fight sequences there are plenty of odd and wierd creative choices that kept reducing the tension and took me out of the film.  The biggest one is his score.  Terrible.  It may work when he used the exact same thing in Oceans 11 but it doesn't fit and failed miserably when using during tense chase scenes.<br /><br />The second big fail was his lead choice.  While this girl clearly has the looks and athletics to carry something like this, she didn't quite pull it off.  Carano is nice to look at but she lacked dept during the few chances for her character to show any emotion.  They had to fall back on a flash back to an earlier scene in the movie to give some exposition on what her character is feeling - never a good sign.  With A-List talent in the lead (think Jolie)is could have been top notch.  Seems like a big back-fire for Soderbergh in going with a non-actor to carry this role.<br /><br />Just an ok movie if you happen to catch it on cable during a rainy Sunday....otherwise, pass......
B007VGXS8M|4.0|love it and how it gets harder and harder as you move up in levels... makes you concentrate harder, wonderful game for attention grabbing fun!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I like the way the game plays and the way it makes you think it out it can go any way it keeps you on you toes.

B0034DGPEU|4.0|I think a little more character development would have helped explain the story more, but overall this is a good book to read.  Prose is easy and flowing and very descriptive.  The story moves along well and draws the reader in.

B004J4WQ46|1.0|I consider myself a loyal fan of the Strokes. I enjoyed Is This It, Room on Fire, and First Impressions of Earth and believed that each of these albums were continuously progressing the band to explore a sound that they had carved out for themselves. It seems that, for me, they have managed to abandon their previously perfected musical arrangements for some sort of pop enfused music that just does not fit their talents. I listened to each track and thought worse and worse of the album, until I heard Call Me Back, the only song that is worth listening to twice.<br /><br />Overall I just thought that this effort of theirs did not match up to their original sound and lacked any clear ambition and direction.<br /><br />I am waiting for that New York sound to return. When it does I will be buying.
B004J4WLPU|4.0|Beatrice has done her best to leave her British past behind her as she climbs the corporate ladder in New York City.  But when she gets a devastating phone call that her beloved younger sister, Tess, has gone missing, she doesn't hesitate to pack up and fly home to London.  When her sister's body is discovered, it is ruled a suicide, but Beatrice can't believe it and she is determined to uncover the truth about really happened to Tess.<br /><br />This book has a fascinating premise.  The more Beatrice investigates, the most mystery she uncovers in Tess's life.  I read a lot so I often guess the ending before the actual ending, but that wasn't true in this case as the author establishes several plausible suspects.<br /><br />However, I was really put off by a twist in the end which made me feel . . . SPOILER ALERT . . . very deceived.  While readers do love dramatic twists, it can't come at the expense of essentially \\"misleading\\" the reader throughout the entire book.<br /><br />Still, this was a satisfying read . . . just without a wholly satisfying ending.
0345803485|5.0|Oh my.....what a story.  I was not able to put it down.  This is some steamy reading. My husband is very happy I am reading this book because it has definately made his life more interesting.  Now, he is reading it to get some new ideas too.  I am now on book two & it's even better.  I can't wait to start book three.  I definately suggest you purchase the whole set.  Enjoy!!!

B0086700CM|5.0|fun game, only drawback is the lagging while in the middle of a run. also need to add more things to unlock in the game.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I heard about the series and when it went straight to the top of the best sellers list...I knew I HAD to read it! It started off strong but a bit unrealistic; a mousy girl, not exceptionally cleaver, attractive or smart is persued by a smart, attractive, successful man. Sounds unlikely, but hey, it's a book. I was intrigued but ended up bored with it. I'm not really into the whole BDSM thing, but the book had some fun pages worth reading. According to my Kindle, I am 90% finished with the first book so I gave the book 3 stars for holding my attention...for a while. I just cannot seem to finish it. I'd simply rather read something else..

B0069JBKHI|2.0|Bought one of these a few monthes ago in preparation for baby due this August. . .  The mount did not fit on our crib railing. It seems they did not consider the variety of crib sizes and designs being sold in the US. We bought our crib at Target so it a fairly common crib design.<br /><br />After several e-mail exchanges with the company, they basically said \\"sorry\\" and suggested I mount it on something else.  Now I find myself in the position of having to find or create something custom to work around this basic design flaw.  Really want to like this product, but it's a bit of a damper when it doesn't 'just work' out of the box. Wish they would have made the mount universal and not just for small-rail-sized-style cribs.
B007OAAK0O|5.0|For all of Diana Ross' many fans, this DVD is a MUST HAVE.  Diana Ross in Central park marks a definitive moment in the life of this great superstar.  The production qualities are superb, the director's commentary enlightening.  Well worth buying, you will not be disappointed.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a fast, easy read!  I bought the last two in the trilogy when I was halfway thru the first in the series.  I couldn't put it down as I wanted to keep reading more about the main characters and see where things would lead.  I hope to see more from this author.  This lets women know they must tell men what they want and just be themselves.  Maybe the romance is a bit idealized, but escape is what reading is all about! I was so sad when the trilogy came to an end.  I was left wanting more!

193413712X|5.0|The paperback cover of \\"tinkers\\" by Paul Harding is haunting, lonely, and remote. A lone figure, apparently a man, is in a snowy, wintry scene. He seems not to be out there for play or sport. He has no choice but to be there, and he trudges to reach some destination.<br /><br />Harding knows that all of us are here in the life and times that are given to us and that are not of our own making. We are here, we have no choice but to struggle and trudge toward whatever comes next.<br /><br />Harding has some idiosyncrasies that can be a bit irritating. He does not use quotation marks. And which character Harding is talking about on the next page or even in the next paragraph can be confusing. His descriptions of nature can go on and on. And he seems to be writing \\"backwards,\\" which I'll explain later.<br /><br />Harding's very first sentence on the very first page says, \\"George Washington Crosby began to hallucinate eight days before he died.\\" And Harding goes even farther back than that. He says, \\"Nearly seventy years before George died, his father, Howard Aaron Crosby, drove a wagon for his living.\\" This sort of time referencing goes on unceasingly throughout the book.<br /><br />Quickly we learn that George had been extremely clever with his hands in the larger business of building his own house, and we find that he is also clever and dexterous in the finer detail of his daily business, which is clock repairing. George must examine and fix those mechanical innards of clocks with the help of the magnifying lenses of jeweler's loops. Eventually, Harding will tell you probably much more than you want to know about the complex inner workings of clocks.<br /><br />Back to the somewhat disturbing counting down to George's death. Harding is constantly telling you, reminding you, that George is going to die. We know it. We know exactly to the very hour when George is going to die. Harding seems to be telling the story backwards. How does he manage this trick?<br /><br />How revolting. That's not how life is. In general, we do not know when someone is going to die, when anyone is going to die, or when we are going to die. How can Harding dare to predict a death with such exactitude?<br /><br />Well, the answer is pretty obvious. Harding is not predicting. George, dear reader, is already dead. Harding is simply time-shifting the program. Author Harding has moved the hands of the clock backwards, and moved the days backward, and has started the whole thing over. The way we do with our TV programs. Except Harding is telling us how many hours or days or minutes are left to go. Irritating for sure, to be unendingly reminded, but ultimately and clearly understandable.<br /><br />Harding does not capitalize the book's title. He is hinting, one can surmise, that all of us are tinkers in our own way, whether fixing clocks or doing whatever it is that we do.<br /><br />Harding has a way with words, to put it mildly. With this book, it is no stretch to call him a prose poet. An example: \\"Tinker, tinker. Tin, tin, tin. Tintinnabulation. There was the ring of pots and buckets.\\" Harding is telling about the daily work of George's father, Howard, who traveled the countryside with horse and wagon, dispensing cleaning products and other household items, and soldering leaky pots and pans, among many other rural doings.<br /><br />George's father is a major part of the story. Howard the father had epileptic fits, which his wife, Kathleen, could not bear. \\"He was a birdbrain, a magpie, a loony bird, flapping around with those fits and all,\\" she would say. \\"That man cast a shadow forever over my peace of mind. The damned fool!\\"<br /><br />Harding can be complicated and difficult to follow. Is he talking about George? Or about Howard? Where are we now? What's going on? The reader has got to be as focused as George is focused when working inside his clocks. I admit I had to read the book a couple of times, and parts of it more.<br /><br />When Howard is out on his rural route, he admires the plants, the animals, the wilds. Harding writes:<br />\\"Howard heard the water reverberating through the soil ... Puddles wobbled and the light cast on them through the clouds looked as if they would ring if tapped with a stick. The puddles rang. The water rang. ... The buzzing bees joined into one ringing chord that pulsed. The field rang and spun.\\"<br /><br />Howard's wife had what anyone would consider to be insane practices. If Howard would be late in coming home from his route on the back roads, Kathleen would force the children, including son George, to sit with her at the table, with the dinner fully on plates before them, getting colder and colder.<br /><br />Kathleen's reacts so badly to having to put a stick in Howard's mouth during his fits (to keep him from biting off his tongue) and to cleaning up the blood and clothing mess, that she determines, in unenlightened times, to have him committed to what was originally called the Eastern Maine Insane Hospital. Howard is far from insane.<br /><br />I won't spoil the story, but there are several things you might imagine that Howard could do, when he finds out about the impending commitment. Are all women in the world like Kathleen? To figure out what happens, you have to pay close attention to reading, especially to a very few pages. And there are only 191 pages in the book. Enough said.<br /><br />Harding's writing has its beauty and excitement, as when he's out in nature and periodically meeting with an Indian acquaintance who needs supplies. And when they meet, there is much silence between them. To Harding, words are not always what counts. Silence can mean more.<br /><br />Harding even takes the story back another generation, to Howard's own father, who was a Methodist minister, whom Howard usually saw laboring upstairs at a desk in preparing his sermons. The outcome of that story is quite interesting.<br /><br />I would wish that Harding could keep us better abreast of whether he's writing about George or about Howard or whomever or whatever. Initially I was confused and divided about the book, but on further reflection, I gladly accept Harding's writing. I like the flow and freedom of it, and I think he has a lot more ahead of him.

0316098329|3.0|First, let's get past the horror of the possibility inherent in this book. It can and it does happen! But, as a work of art, of something with which to spend one's time, I've more to say.<br /><br />I came late to this book. Didn't intend to read it, but it is an assigned read; and the only reason I can imagine that it is assigned is to show the perfection with which an author can reveal details. The first third --  yes definite thirds - was dedicated to introducing Ma and Jack and Old Nick and how the three came together. I was truly taken in by the arduous task of living with Jack in one room. There were some red herrings - I thought at first that Ma was a drug addict. At times I thought Nick was a \\"good guy\\" and I thought maybe there was some element of the captor identifying and \\"liking\\" the captor. (Stockholm syndrome?) This weird psychology was later explained (in the third section) by adding a previous dead child, etc. I didn't much care for that. I think the truth would be far more intricate and wouldn't require a previous dead baby.<br /><br />Beyond the first portion, as we learn what \\"get some\\" means, as we learn about the sound of the door code, as we look with great generosity upon Ma (who is never identified), we learn very little. I know the book itself, the structure of the text is intended to resemble a tightly built room - excluding much more than it admits, and that the fresh air that blows in when the door opens is often tainted by things that cause discomfort, but the author left me without relief.<br /><br />The section in the Clinic is useless, as are the silly passages about Jack and his new extended family. Only steppa seemed real and normal and all-accepting of him. But, alas that too is tainted as steppa is disliked by Ma and maybe by grandma. He is an ancillary, not too well loved person in the book; also Grandpa, whose honesty about Jack's origins banish him from the family. His avoidance of the boy is only a weak method for the author to show that Ma is willing to give up her family for her boy. We get it!!<br /><br />About Ma. What's this business of being \\"gone?\\" Why the attempt at suicide? Not enough foundation for that, it felt like filler. Hitting all the notes that the reading public clamors for. Her recovery from said effort was too swift, and leaving Jack alone with her so soon in the Independent Living was dangerous. All that in three weeks? Come on!<br /><br />Jack is what he is. I feel he is drawn perfectly and he grows out of the circumstances dictated by the book.. He has no unreasonable thoughts or activities, though yes, his vocabulary might be too great. I hate that his cousin, Bronwyn, is degraded by being babyish and demanding, as an illustration of Jack's maturity. Too unrealistic.<br /><br />Frustrating for me was the excessive use of the word \\"bit.\\" I wanted to scream. Could there have been no other pronoun or noun used to describe a part of a whole. That was really hard to take.<br /><br />The most frustrating part, though it extends throughout the whole book, is Ma's constant allusions to books, paintings, stories, myths, religious stories, all that over and over and over again. I was already sick of Alice and \\"baby Jesus and St. Paul,\\" but when the Great Escape occurred on Easter Sunday, really I wanted to gag -- but I did read on. It is as if the author needed to trot out all her childhood favs, stories and lessons and show how they influence us. We get it!!!<br /><br />The lack of closure beyond \\"Goodbye Room,\\" was poor. I would rather the author had cut out some of the post-Clinic trips and Grandma's aggravations  and given a little time to the court case, to the sessions between Ma and Dr. Clay and Noreen. Pilar and Officer Oh were fabulous, interesting and important in their ways.<br /><br />I am interested to know the real source of this story. Among the many books mentioned in the story was \\"The Shack,\\" and I am wondering (because I loathed that book), if Donoghue either created something with that same \\"in the news feel\\" because she read The Shack, or if she wrote it from some inside knowledge of some true case. The Shack was a sham of a book, poorly written and a book that relied on sensationalism with a backdrop of Christian redemption earned not by prayer and sacrifice but by convenience. An accident, a hospitalization, probably drug-induced stupor all contributed to the dream of redemption. That is not redemption. Ma and Jack were indeed redeemed, and theirs seemed to me more genuine.<br /><br />We know Ma was no \\"saint\\" when she got picked up, and the book sort of wants us to think her abduction was a punishment for her \\"sin\\" of her prior abortion. The author then adds another baby  who must die before St. Jack is born.<br /><br />Conveniently, Ma dreamed up plans A&B after Jack saw the airplane and she had to begin telling him the real truth about outside and inside. There is something worth investigating in her timing of a plan. I am not \\"blaming\\" her for being incarcerated, nor am I wondering why she didn't make a better or sooner effort to fight to get out. (In fact she put Jack in grave danger - a five year old upon whom their Escape was dependent). I am wondering why the author did not use a more profound moment for Ma to come to a plan. If she wanted to play the Christian theme, the author could have staged a visitation from Baby Jesus or his mother and planted the idea in Ma's head. The airplane was not enough to put in motion the complexities of the Escape.<br /><br />In all it was a good book. It was better than The Shack, (by 10x) and better than some \\"popular\\" books which are promoted as the \\"next great thing.\\"  THis is not literature -- it simply alludes to literature --  but that's okay too.ther created something with that same \\"in the news feel\\" because she read The Shack, or if she wrote it from some inside knowledge of some true case.

B001AGXEA6|4.0|Beetlejuice is a movie I consider to be one of Tim Burton's best movies. I also consider it to be one of those kind of movies that could have come out only in the 80s (much like Labyrinth starring David Bowie and Jennifer Connelly).<br /><br />Beetlejuice deals with a recently deceased married couple, the Maitlands, who finds themselves essentially \\"trapped\\" in their former house for the next century or so. Unfortunately, this means living with the house's new owners, the Deetz. The Maitlands don't mind Deetz daughter Lydia played by Winona Ryder so much but her much more obnoxious parents and want to scare them away from the house. Their case worker tells them only one thing: to NEVER even think about recruiting her former assistant Beetlejuice. Unfortunately, they manage to resist for a while before giving in and Beetlejuice causes nothing but problems.<br /><br />It's definitely a work by Tim Burton. His ever-present \\"uniqueness\\" and charm is there. Beetlejuice is a fun 80s movie and a very fun watch period. the acting by everyone involved in the movie is great (especially Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice). The make-up for the necessary characters were well done and the \\"afterlife\\" set designs and make-up there were great. I loved the make-up and designs in the afterlife scenes.<br /><br />The movie itself is great and I would have given it five stars. The blu-ray as a whole leaves a little to be desired. It's one of those DVDs or blurays that pretty much leaps right into the movie. No title screen, scene selection, anything. This was a bit annoying since I had to manually go skip through the whole movie to get back to where I left off the night before. There's a small handful of special features that you may or may not be interested in. The special features are only three episodes of the cartoon series (of which I watched as a kid) and an audio track. The special features it does have really aren't that bad, I would have just liked to have had more. Like some sortof commentary, deleted scenes, or something.<br /><br />All in all, five stars for movie itself and three for the blu-ray (averaging four stars).
B000002U8G|5.0|This is one of Pink Floyd's greatest albums. Echoes is not only my favorite Pink Floyd song, but my favorite song<br />of all time--from any band. It makes my mind drift off to a wonderful place from the very first notes, no matter how many times I have listened to it-\\"all 24 blissful minutes\\".<br />Beautiful lyrics that evoke such wonderful imagery and such intricate musicianship-who could ask for more!<br /><br />As for the rest of the album: songs like \\"Pillow Of Winds\\" and \\"Fearless\\" ---just as excellent in every way<br />(listen to those lyrics!-purely amazing). \\"One Of These Days\\" is a great opener for the album, more flawless musicianship to carry you away. Yes, the other two songs are not the band's best, but in their own right-very experimental and good songs, I still love to hear them.<br /><br />So if you like superb musicianship form all members of a band and music that you can sit down and listen to that will take you far away from the stress & problems that life sometimes throws at you. You can never go wrong with this band, they are masters of their craft and none other has or ever will compare to this music---NOBODY DOES IT BETTER THAN PINK FLOYD!!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun game. grew up playing original Oregon trail in the 90s and this is a great new twist on a classic
B0054JZC6E|4.0|:)<br />super fun when bored. I really like it. I just wish the games had like &quot;instructions&quot;. Lol. I have nothing else to say. :)

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Incredible story with a unique twist! A true testament to \\"behind every great man, is a great woman\\"! When I began reading, I started to think that this wasn't for me, but as I read on, I couldn't put it down!
0345803485|5.0|I'm going to start by saying that I'm not a good reader myself. A book has to be beyond amazing for me to read beyond 20 pages, at this moment I've read about 500 pages of this story, and everytime I pick it up I read atleast 100 pages. I have to say I can not comprehend how someone can read this book, and not like it. I can not stop reading, and the thought that one day I'm going to read the very last page of book 3 makes me feel beyond sad. Christian Grey, Anastasia Steele, Elena Lincoln, Katherine, all characters are captivating! Out of this world experience to read such book. IF YOU HAVE A CHANCE GRAB IT, AND READ IT. You will not be disappointed.
B0086700CM|5.0|exactly wat the title is.... yaaaaaayyyy!!!! im so excited to play this. i play this on my friends ipod alll the time!!
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is really interesting because get when dead or ghost apes try to attack u its weird because I'm so addicted to this game .
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game don't get me wrong, but it reminds me of pictionary. I mean, People Its Not A New Game!!!!!
B004XUMN6W|2.0|This is the first episode of this terrific series that's a real stinker.It was never broadcast so I hadn't seen it before. I had a tuff time making it thru, tho Frederic Lane(aka US Marshal Edward Mars from Lost)always makes a convincing villain.
0345803485|5.0|Book was amazing. Read all three. I couldn't put the book down. It was just so intense. I did not want to finish it. Sadly I did but I loved every moment I read
B003O86FMW|4.0|Like the first book in this series, I can't believe I liked it.  Usually something that \\"everyone\\" loves, I don't.  But Suzanne Collins is a wicked good story-teller.  Somehow she manages to keep us caring about Katniss, and finds an extremely clever way to get her back in the Hunger Games for a second time.  I couldn't believe it!  Well done.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it. adicting, fun, keeps you wanting more! why could it of not come out sooner?!?! again...LOVE IT!!&lt;3 enjoy!((;
B0036OS3EW|5.0|My wife is happy with his new boots crocs are super soft and very comfortable, she is black and now wants other colors.
B002EWD0I6|5.0|This series is a very accurate look at a dying culture.  Yes, it still exists in my village adn contrary to what people say(who have obviously never lived in the country) the WHEAT REALLY DOES LOOK GOLD at certain times.  I read some reviews saying that it wasn't a realistic view of life.  But really it is, our village centers around the post office, we just had a big fight with a larger city to keep it. Haha, and this series brought that all back.  We have our own sayings...\\"If you wanted a different flavor, then you should have bought a different pie\\"...\\"You can't cross a creek without muddying your shoes\\"....sometimes we make up completely new ones. Everyone knows everyones business and we know who the gossips are and treat them pretty much the same way that Lark Rise treats their gossip.  We have the people who are always in debt.  And while no one really dies to much in Lark Rise, at that time period people died often.  I know of bobbin lace and make tatting myself.  When queenie uses her rather witch-like remedies it reminds me of the old back woods women who held and unusual mix of belief between Christianity and some sort of Voodoo. And at the end when Queenie became sad at the change of time, I cried......because I know that our little corner will not remained unchanged for long.  So far we tend our gardens, go to our church, and gather around to shoot the breeze and have some wurst and beer....but in 50 years, maybe we'll be too busy with our computers and cellphones to notice each other, even when we're in the same room.  I won't let it happen to me, but it may happen to our village
B0052VUNHC|4.0|I read this story a few weeks ago, and it still crosses my mind. There was a lot of emotional angst and ups and downs, but the author shows how insecurities, past personal issues and inner fears can truly affect a relationship. They were not perfect and yes, they were dysfunctional in many ways, but seriously, is any relationship perfect? This is a story about an imperfect relationship. I did not like the conflict with the mob - it seemed out of place and unbelievable. Other than that, this was a very interesting read.
1401937519|5.0|A thoughtful, frank and poised discussion regarding one soul's journey to the original frontier; where everybody comes from and evermore shall return.  This book is an enormous gift as it is an expansion of concepts and principles that are extant in many religions, but that have been buried and or contorted to conform to dogma and doctrine.  It is quite fascinating (for me anyway) not to mention rewarding, to find how well these messages dovetail with the \\"Conversations with God\\" catalogue of work as well as Buddhist and Yogic acumen.  This work flows with joy, is well written & edited, and in the process of divulging it's content does not excoriate, judge or condemn.  What a gem!  5 stars, warmly.
B00884GR0W|1.0|complete ripoff of mindcraft and not even a good one. I guess I don't understand why people try and jump on the bandwagon someone else created.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is a fun game I'm trying to save up for the Chinese lady. the fast power is good for me
B0054JZC6E|5.0|loves it my kids play everyday. they have fun unlocking the new games. this is a good game for parents and kids.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting my whole life for temple run one the kindle fire.I am woo glad they brought it on her.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I've listened to audio instruction from You-Tube, which were all good, but it is nice, especially if you're just getting started, to have an instructional pamphlet on your desk top to review the information straight from the source you are trying to cooperate with.  This little tool is pulled up every time I begin to build my e-book, to ensure I'm putting everything together right.<br /><br />I've published two e-books, www.amazon.com/author/jimmiller232, and this pamphlet has been a good guide for the structure of my front pages, etc.<br /><br />It also just takes a few minutes to read.  Best wishes on your new adventures in e-books.
B00785P2QC|4.0|this game is good. I could be better btly making actual people walk around and if it was quicker to get the invest points
B002ZB26AO|5.0|really great for those who know little about North Korea. I really, really enjoyed this book. I knew very little when I first started reading this compilation of stories, but she really did a great job telling everyones story.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Quick review. Bought this last week when it was on sale for 29.99 (I waited 2 long years!) and very happy that it still came in the original hard cover book packaging. If you don't know what I mean just go to youtube and check out some unboxing done for this US edition. This edition is so much better than the UK edition and feels so sturdy. Ppl might complain about the cardboard used to hold the blu rays and that it might scratch the discs over time but it should be ok if you are careful - be gentle each time and you should be fine.
B007BLUD30|3.0|This comedy was just a fun, easy and light hearted movie to watch. Would I buy it no, but it's was fun for the night.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is is awesome and addictive so if u want to be addicted to a game, play this one. I had a lot of fun playing it and hope others have fun too
B008578PMU|1.0|The trailer duped me into renting this. I just thought the movie was just plain bad: To the visual effects, the bad acting, and the horrible story line. I would not recommend.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|The author builds suspense very effectively. When I thought I had the plot figured out, he introduced a blockbuster surprise. The story is well written, characters are well developed and its one of those books you don't want to put down. I immediately bought another Baldacci book and he's already captured my interest. He really knows how to write a mystery.
B007MAETA8|5.0|I do not consider myself a huge fan of Mayer's music, though I have purchased some of his other releases. I got this one because I figured it would be good background music while I do other things. It's way better than that.  I love this album. It's cleaerly a country-influenced album but it also seems to have a very late 70s pop rock vibe to me. I'm actually listening carefully to each song, something Mayer has not in the past always inspired me to do.  In any case, it's on heavy rotation on my computer, and is my favorite release of 2012 so far.
0785132619|5.0|I read this book after seeing the movie but that shouldn't stop you from really enjoying this book. I found myself trying to read just the first chapter of the book and then I couldn't stop reading! This book is definitely not for everyone but it is a very good read and I would recomend it. I can't wait to read the second book and see the second movie
B001PBEJL4|3.0|The quality of this new blu-ray transfer of \\"Camelot\\" is good, but not great.  It's perhaps the old grainy film stock that was used back in the 60's, but it didn't translate to blu-ray as well as I had hoped.  It certainly is tons better than the \\"My Fair Lady\\" fiasco by CBS (which could have been stunning had they used the 70mm restored print master).  The dark scenes are the worst, but the other, lighter scenes, look very good.  Wish it could have been digitally restored and they had cleaned up some of the annoying artifacts that show up so noticeably on blu-ray.  Still, if you like this movie, you will be happy to have this \\"new\\" blu-ray release in your collection.  The program book included in this release is great.  The soundtrack is a plus, too.  It looks and sounds far better than the DVD.
B0041KW2UQ|1.0|I did NOT read anywhere in your write-up that this DVD was in Italian.  I wrote to the seller and asked if it could be used in the U.S. and he said it could just change the regional or country code.  (But you have to have an \\"all regional\\" player to be able to use it that I did not know at the time.)  So, I opened it and it did not work so now I am stuck with a product that we cannot use.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT UNLESS YOU HAVE AN \\"AND ALL REGIONAL PLAYER\\" so you can change the region.
0345803485|5.0|For myself I thought this book was good. I felt hot and heavy when reading it. It definitely isn't for everyone, especially if sex is awkward to talk about. I just picked up the second one and can't put it down.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I'll preface my review by explaining my review title.  Simply put, unless Miss Moning names the next 2 books about these characters as a new series, leaving out the Dani O'Malley trilogy in this case, which is starting soon, this is not the last book in the Fever series anymore.  Miss Moning's made a post online on her Facebook page saying that there will be 2 more books that she's agreed to write about these charactes, not counting the already mentioned trilogy and a graphic novel.  I was all ready to give this fifth novel one of my standard rave reviews, but that doesn't really fit exactly right this time.  It was amazing, but not quite as easy ot \\"pin down\\".  Yes, it asks some essential questions like the previous books, but there's so much more.  This book's emotional quotient is extremely high.  It will have you feeling as if you are on a roller coaster.  While so much has been answered, there's also a great deal that could be left to be discovered and said and felt.  If you've gotten through book four in this series, you should definitely give this one a shot as you won't be disappointed if you liked the rest preceding it.  I can't recommend this book higher.  That's most of the reason I am glad there will be more novels with this series and its world in the not too distant future.  There are many twists and turns in this one that will keep you guessing and second guessing and going back and forth between opinions and thinking you know something.  It's quite a ride.  Have at it!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Great game - very addicting and the game includes tons of levels!  Clean layout, easy to learn and play.  Highly recommended.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|great game. solid game play. good graphics. fun to play. all in all, I enjoy it a lot. good job to glu mobile games again
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is the most incipid book I have read in sometime.  The book almost seems to a been written by some computer program.  The characters were under developed, sterotypes, the setting was banal.  I would not recommend this read to anyone, it was the biggest dissapointment.  I am so thankful that I didn't purchase the trilogy..it was that bad.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run so glad they came out with it on the kindle fire it is woo addicting but its woo awesome! !! :)
B0086700CM|5.0|YES they finally brought Temple run to kindle fire I played that on my friend's ipod because it wouldn't download on my iphone.
B0086700CM|5.0|this js the best game ever people said omg this is great so i seen it on fire so i was like ill try now this is my free time
B00881VLCE|5.0|I like puzzles and I like the fact that there are easy ones to begin with.  This is a great way to spend a few extra minutes. I'll work my way up to the difficult ones! LOL<br />(
B006ZCWTV0|5.0|Once upon we listed to singles on 78 records, then on 45s with the big hole, then someone came up with the idea of the LP, a big old record spinning at 33 rpm with lots of songs.<br /><br />When an LP of our favorites came out, we would gather our friends together, sit on the floor, and listen straight through several times. An LP became more than a set of singles, it was a unique vision composed of invididual parts like chapters in a book.<br /><br />An example most people can relate to: the Beatle's Yellow Submarine LP or, for a different generation, Michael Jackson's Thriller. Every really fine band or singer spent much time making the LP be something much greater than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />Bruce has always done this, growing up at the same time I did, listening to a lot of the same LPs.<br /><br />With the Wrecking Ball CD, the sum is a transcendent vision.<br /><br />If only Bruce's Appolo Theater concert would be released, freed from the Sirius/XM boot loggers.<br /><br />With the Wrecking Ball CD, we have the equivalent of Beethoven's Ninth, recorded in the studio with all of its subtle artistic passages.<br /><br />Imagine what it  would be like to have along with that a recording of the premier performance of Beethoven's Ninth.<br /><br />For me,  the Wrecking Ball is Bruces's finest CD, sweeping in vision and exhilarating in experience.<br /><br />Bruce's entire Apollo Theater concert would be his second finest CD.<br /><br />But's let's not quibble, I said \\"for me...\\"
B0086700CM|5.0|I love the game because it makes you really wonder about what you do next.  I love the design. the wondering. the funnest
B000GFLKF8|3.0|I would rate the plot five stars: it is clever, it is logical, and it has its twists and turns. The script is also excellent, with sharp dialogue and some wit.<br /><br />On the negative side: First there is the terrible camera work, with the camera unsteady most of the time, and violently shaking during the scene when the police enter the bank.<br /><br />Secondly, there is the hamming of the actress representing Ms White. Her gratuitous cockiness and nastiness and threats make me sick whenever she appears.<br />The same is true, though to a lessor extent, of the gloating of Detective Frazier. (Incidentally, what did he do with the diamond? Did he pocket it?)
B0063GORYU|5.0|If you like Solitaire you'll love Spider solitaire. More challenging and requires strategy.  I spend way too much time on this game as it is addictive.
1439192812|2.0|I promise this is my last comment on Dawkins' books as I am in danger of becoming part of the vast cloud of Dawkins groupies.<br /><br />What a great idea, produce a book with nifty illustrations which will appeal to children and with good, sound explanations of various phenomena which will appeal to scientifically inclined adults who will then buy those books for themselves and as presents for those youngsters in their lives they hope to influence.<br /><br />I give \\"Magic\\" five stars for the illustrations,  five stars for the explanation of scientific facts, and minus five for the myth busting, making an average of one and two-thirds, hence the two stars.<br /><br />In spite of the protestations of Dawkins, this is a book to promote atheism among young people.  His equations are clear:<br />  religion = myth =  false = evil<br />  atheism = science = truth = good<br /><br />Busting myths is easy, understanding the role of myths throughout history isn't.  If one wishes to understand something about myths and their influence I would suggest starting with the well known works of Joseph Campbell.<br /><br />Allow me to select some quotes from a well known great scientist, Richard Feynman:<br /><br />\\"Dear Mrs. Chown, Ignore your son's attempts to teach you physics. Physics isn't the most important thing. Love is. Best wishes, Richard Feynman. \\"<br /><br />\\"Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts.\\"<br /><br />\\"Much more truth can become known than can be proved.\\"<br /><br />I close with one of my favorite myths.  From Genesis, the second story of creation:<br />\\"And God created man from the dust of the earth, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul.\\"<br /><br />Even if you are a devout Bible believer (I of course, being a physicist, am not) this obviously cannot be literally true since it doesn't even agree with the first story of creation in Genesis.  It only has the meaning you invest it with, and its meaning changesas you change.  It is not science, it is beautiful poetry, it strikes a chord within me, and I love it.<br /><br />I ignore the temptation to go on and on.  Adieu kind friends and all best wishes for the success of your personal quest.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I bought the trilogy based on a recommendation by a friend and I have not put down my kindle till the 3 books were done.  They were gripping, thrilling and the characters were larger than life.  It was hard not to love and hate every character in the books. The author does a brilliant job in keeping you hooked and desperate to find out what happens next.  I recommend this book to anyone and everyone!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I should have read the previous reviews...Total waste of money. Sophomore writing and juvenile sex....LOVED THE HUNGER GAMES SERIES though!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been wanting this game to come out on kindle for since i got my kindle. Too bad i cant get it because i dont have a credit card number in. :( :( :( :(
630471193X|5.0|movies don't come along like this often enough. Great story that requires a little imagination and little intelligence. A small town every man meets meteorite or does he? What happens beyond this phenomenon is a story you will remember for a long time if you have a little imagination and truly enjoy an evening of just letting yourself make believe. Isn't that what movies are all about? It's not to far fetched and is whimsical in every aspect. Travolta and Duvall are wonderful as is the rest of the cast. Have an evening of what if.
B0086700CM|5.0|I play all the time I have now gotten my sister addicted to playing the game I freaking love it
B00011CZRE|5.0|I think director David Fincher hit his stride with this movie. You already know or have the storyline so just an opinion, acting great, direction great, story great, cinematography great, atmospher great, dialog great need more? Screenplay great, color tones great this movie is well you know GREAT!!! 5+STARS I will always tell it like I see it.<br />S&S.M
B0086700CM|5.0|I would really reccomend buying this fun FREE app.<br />and its reply entertaining for kids ages 3-any age<br />some people may get frustrated but its realm fun and it keeps you busy while bored or traveling
B005HJU7HA|5.0|If you like Sherlock Holmes, then this is the book for you. Every story in one volume for one dollar is hard to beat. It was a thrill to see some brand new technology--the telephone--suddenly appear in the final stories. There are a few typos from time to time, but mostly it's a quality effort. The \\"Tales of Mystery\\" I didn't care for and only read a couple and then quit. But the Sherlock Holmes stories were great.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|super fun,  addictive game. Fun on break at work or when my husband or child takes over the Tv. very entertaining!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is fun for everyone who plays-from my kindergartener to my husband and me. Some games are simple and others are a challenge. This game is sure to provide hours of fun to anyone who gets it!

B000E6ET1G|4.0|This is seminal psych, more toward garage than psych, but is good garage, fast paced and well composed, not campy. The sound quality is quite good and clear. It's an interesting compilation.
0345803485|5.0|I read a lot, but haven't purchased a book in years. Either I go to the library to check out a book or wait until by Mother passes along one when she finishes. When I heard about the book Fifty Shade of Grey, I just had to have it. However I refuse to pay retail and when I heard that their were 3  books, (Trilogy) I also knew it was time to own a Kindle. Amazon has great prices for books, they had plenty of new and used at a great price! The book was in excellent condition and it was delivered in a timely fashion. I am now on the second book, purchased on my Kindle with one touch shopping! Amazon is my one stop shopping center!<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />CC of Springfield Gardens, NY
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I am amazed at how the buttons are so big! They take full advantage of the big screen and I love how the guide is easy to see and use!
B00881VLCE|1.0|If you love kittens I guess this would be perfect. There are only a few jigsaw pictures (all kittens). You have to pay to get any of the other pictures shown in the preview. The controls don't work well either, in particular the top right puzzle piece is very hard to move. Uninstalling.
B00005OM5I|5.0|Judas Priest was one of my favorite bands in high school.  On of the few groups I was actually \\"into\\" before they hit the big time.  This is one of their best albums.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is was one of the first games I downloaded and its like the only game I play!!!!!!! I love this game!!!!! :-)
B0073LWEXK|5.0|this is the best mystery game I've ever played!!! Awesome graphics!! Game length is right not too short or long.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game! It's fast and easy to play.The picture is clear and easy to see. I highly recommend this app if you are looking for a fast, relaxing, entertaining game!
B001JNND9W|5.0|The film has already been reviewed. It's a classic. It's a muscle car movie. It's a great period piece of the 1970s American Southwest. And the Blu-Ray brings it all to life in stunning detail, vivid color, and visceral sound. It's a beautiful thing.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is for 13 year olds and should be marketed in the same way.  Was way too predictable and boring! Waste of my time!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Okay the book does capture your interest and it is an easy read, but I don't get all the fuss about it.  Libraries pulling it from the shelves...why??  I have free ebook access to my library and downloaded a book called A Hot Mess, that had more sex scenes in it then 50 shades!!!  and I might add, way hotter!!!  lol....I will continue to read the other two 50 shades books because it is an interesting story.
B005K17RU0|5.0|works well on my kindle fire and unlike many apps, works well internationally. App info compared with actual conditions on the ground very accurate. Easy to use.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|The product had great sound quality and was brand new. The full screen and color made it a real joy to watch as if you are really there. I would highly recommend this item.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|there Is bunch of games to get you cant just wait to earn more money to buy the other games<br />if you get this game there is 23 more games so that's even more of a bonus<br /> there is also games like tornado hockey, sudoku and a lot more.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it play it every day. great for playing wherever you go. what a app.best app I ever got.
0307730697|5.0|I just finished this book last night. I literally read 3/4 of it in one day, I simply could not put it down. The struggles that Adam and his family endured were incredible but this mans resolve, his love of his wife, country and God pulled him through to become one of the most elite and respected operators in the US military. Eric Blehm has done a fantastic job of telling Adam's story.... Simply can not recommend it strongly enough!
B004HD61KE|5.0|I have to say that I LOVE that James includes some little known history into his books. Not having known much about Thomas Jefferson, I find it exhilarating that he cared so much about the Indian nation that he was an avid collector of Indian artifacts.  Another thing about Jefferson that many of you may not be aware of is the fact that he was VERY into creating codes and much of his correspondence to friends was done through codes he himself created.<br /><br />James Rollins does an excellent job with his research into the Inca tribe and his research on Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson. Yea, I didn't mention that Franklin was involved in this did I!??  See how I keep you guys guessing!?? Thomas Jefferson was very serious about his collection of Indian artifacts. It was widely believed that Jefferson had a huge collection of Indian artifacts but after his death, a majority of them disappeared from his collection. What happened to his collection?  That is STILL a mystery that has yet to been solved! Anyone out there know the ANSWER??<br /><br />I am trying to figure out how to explain to you guys what is going on in this book! I don't wanna give too much of it away as you guys well know, cause what's my fav saying!!???  READ THE BOOK!!! That being said, Devils colony is about, what happens when a lost Indian tribe is discovered.  It seems on first glance that they are a regular Indian tribe but it is soon discovered that they are not.<br /><br />Without going into too much more detail, this book takes us on a free for all ride from scientific to old school Indian stuff.  Our heroine has to figure out which side of the fence she should be on... Our MANY heroes ride rampant trying to uncover and discover what the TRUE story is. In the end they have to race against the clock to do what!!?? SAVE the world!! Save the world HOW you ask?  Ummm READ THE BOOK! Seriously, you guys should know me by now!<br /><br />As for our Antagonist... this is a guy that makes you want to kill him on site!  Ya know what tho!?? Without HIM our story wouldn't unravel in the manner that it did... and to a certain degree, he is kinda likeable! He is that itchy spot in the middle of your back that you would KILL to get rid of, but once it's gone...  AWW, you MISS it! Anyways, James got me again! I SWEAR one of these days I am gonna get him BACK!! Sooner or later I will figure out what's going on BEFORE he ends up pointing the obvious out to me!!!!t to kill him on site!  Ya know what tho!?? Without HIM our story wouldn't unravel in the manner that it did... and to a certain degree, he is kinda likeable! He is that itchy spot in the middle of your back that you would KILL to get rid of, but once it's gone...  AWW, you MISS it! Anyways, James got me again! I SWEAR one of these days I am gonna get him BACK!! Sooner or later I will figure out what's going on BEFORE he ends up pointing the obvious out to me!!!!
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I wish you didn't have to have wifi to use it. it's  great but I can never get to it on the road. other than that, great app.
B0062LU85S|5.0|Great soundtrack.If this soundtrack had been released before my wedding I would have totally used the instramental of \\"Turning Page\\" as my wedding march. Beautiful.
B005DOKL3E|5.0|I am plesantly surprised at how nice this case is.  I love the color I chose and the feel of the case is nice also.  It seems sturdy and I really like it.
B007LYB0PC|5.0|The songs here are all excellent top-tier cuts from Jack White.  It sounds like a gorgeous, refined blend of the kinds of sounds you might hear on a White Stripes release.  The production is quite organic as with any Jack White release.  Some really cool guitar-driven tracks as well as more rhythmically-driven piano tracks.  There's even a cut that is almost like a rap in the vocal delivery, but don't let that turn you off and trust me when I say it's all great stuff here.<br /><br />So what's different on here than a White Stripes album?  No red, white, and black aesthetic for one thing but more importantly, common White Stripes lyrical themes of childhood innocence are noticeably absent here.<br /><br />For people buying the vinyl, the download card does NOT get you access to lossless quality files. 320kb mp3s only.  Comes with a nice paper sleeve with a plastic lining. Bottom line: another quality release from JW III.
0887307280|5.0|very well write and informative.  interesting explaination about how to work \\"on\\" your business rather that \\"in\\" your business so that you do more than only make yourself a job.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is very entertaining!!!!!! some things I don't like is ybe fact that you have to unlock the games I mean its called 101-in-1 games for a reason....but if you think about it you want new games so you keep playing!
B0025UHKNS|4.0|great watch to control your traning plans,<br />this product help to planing regular runs and do not give up your fitness
B00178JDCK|1.0|This pedal made so much noise in my guitar rigs it was completely unusable.  Was trying for a cheap \\"shimmer\\" effect.  Look elsewhere.  It burned through a new 9 volt battery in about 10 minutes as well.  I see nothing positive to say about this product, and that is just not how I normally am.  I returned it.  Save yourself the hassle and save for a Line6 or better product.
B005ERIRZE|5.0|The book is a real eye-opener - it has explanations for most of the situations when you just don't feel like doing something :)
B004T4LUPW|5.0|This app keeps me on track. The fact that it uses Google calendars as its core means that all my devices are synced at all times as long as they have an internet connection. Some apps need local (server) version running before a sync can take place, but this does not. The Android widgets provide instant access to the calendar and there are many views to choose from. The iPad views scroll very nicely, and reminders appear in the iPad reminder window. Mulitple reminders can be set for all apps, including email, SMS and popup. This app is one of the \\"must-haves\\" for all of your portable devices.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This series could have been a lot weaker and still been a pleasure to watch. It has solid acting, particularly Maggie Smith, who looks like she's never had more fun, and a solid ensemble cast. It has an engaging, soap-y story line, with multidimensional characters. It has solid writing, that both illuminates history and makes it compelling and current. Production values are very high. It shows like an HBO program, only without the swearing. I'm looking forward to whatever direction the program takes next.
B005LB1MY6|5.0|Not sure how else to describe it.  I've been a fan of \\"Cross\\" for a while now, but for some reason I never branched out to Justice's other albums... until now.  First stop: Audio Video Disco.  I've been playing Cross and this album back-to-back for the last few days and it gets better every time I listen through it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Awful writing and ridiculous scenario.  Downoaded quickly and problem free to my Kindle within minutes.  In my opinion this is a complete waste of time.  If people are curious about bondage there are better reads for sure.

B0086700CM|4.0|good game. gets a little &quot;jerky&quot; like cuts in and out. and doesn't sense my swipe occasionaly. overall it is pretty fun. and addictive
B0059XTUVI|3.0|Meryl Streep gives yet another Oscar-worthy performance as Margaret Thatcher in The Iron Lady.  I appreciated the historical biopic of the film, as Thatcher's political persona has always been a bit controversial.  I loved the flashbacks which gave the viewer insight into Thatcher's childhood and early political career.  All in all, a satisfying film with a good supporting cast and Streep's unfailing talent.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|don't listen to the bad reviews this game is super fun and to the guy who downloaded it on ALL of his kindles why do you need more than 1??!!

B0086700CM|5.0|easy to play during boring times<br />and fun and its addicting trying to get the coins to unlock things like fifteenth people
B006T3IVY4|5.0|This has to be considered one of many of Barbra's highest achievements. This is a wonderful musical with a good story and drama. Fanny Brice, who the story is about was a shinning star in her time, followered by Alice Faye who portrayed Fanny, and was a shining star of her time , followered by Barberra Stiesand who portrayed Fanny, and who was the shining star of her time. The story is timeless, girl falls head over heals for a guy, and who stand's by her Man through thick and thin.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|this app is very addicting. it is just like you would expect it,  a pinball game.nothing really special but it is very fun.

B005LAIGZU|5.0|Simply the best movie in it's genre of all time. I'll admit, the acting is not in the class of professional hollywood stars...but these guys are SEAL's, they spend their time training, fighting and occasionally dying to keep all of the hollywood stars free.<br /><br />I love it.  The Seals and Swcc boat crews did an amazing job in this film!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I fell in love with this series in Book 1. I can't wait to read Book 3!! There are a lot of repetitive words/phrases used in the series, but I like the story line. I think the author did a great job, after all she said her goal was to write something her readers would fall in love with. Goal accomplished.
B004XQO90E|2.0|*All of my reviews contain spoilers.*<br /><br />Duncan Jones forever won over my heart with his directorial debut, Moon. As a result, I can forgive and even commend the man for his effort in trying to elevate this banal script. Still, this movie is a failure on nearly every level, save for a couple of flourishes coming specifically from the neophyte director.<br /><br />Army helicopter pilot Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) finds himself part of a mysterious military operation known simply as, \\"Source Code.\\" This program (or something) allows the good Captain's consciousness to inhabit another person's body, as long as that person is of similar body and synapse type (or something.) Captain Stevens is tasked with inhabiting the shell of Sean Fentress, an all-but-anonymous Chicago school teacher who was killed in a bombing of a train on his way to work. Poor bastard. Stevens will live out the last eight minutes of Fentress' life aboard the train, in which he must attempt to find the bomber.<br /><br />Screenwriter Ben Ripley has a decent premise here, with a somewhat interesting sci-fi plot device peppered in, so it's really rather disappointing that he wastes the opportunity with inane plotting, shallow characters, and embarrassing dialogue. Colter Stevens fails to stop the bomb or find the bomber. Numerous times. That's okay, though, because as it's explained to him, the terrorist event he's forced to relive already took place, and he's merely working in a tangential timeline created by the Source Code program (or something) based off of the dying brainwaves of the recently deceased Mr. Fentress. How Mr. Fentress' brain, or its waves survived the bombing is beyond me, but an astute observer will recognize that at this point, there's absolutely no threat whatsoever. Colter Stevens can continue his Wile E. Coyote act Ad infinitum.<br /><br />Ripley tries desperately to remedy this tension killer by shamelessly shoehorning a new plot element in the second act. Apparently, the attack on the train was just the beginning, and Mr. Terrorist plans to blow up other parts of Chicago... at some point. We're never really given even a hint of how much time Colter has to find the terrorist, and Ripley is only interested in using this plot device when it's convenient.<br /><br />In the meantime, we get to explore the creepy burgeoning romance between Stevens/Fentress and his co-worker Christina (Michelle Monaghan.) After spending about ten minutes with her, and witnessing how cool a cucumber she is when somebody spills coffee on her kicks, Stevens inexplicably decides he's in love with her. Why the audience should care is beyond me.<br /><br />Terrible dialogue is exchanged. Nothing is explained. By the fifth or sixth failure to catch the terrorist, I begin to realize how incompetent Colter Stevens is, and how useless his Commanding Officer Captain Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) and the creator of the Source Code... whatever it is, Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright) are. Neither bothers explaining a thing to poor, inept Captain Stevens, who is obviously not qualified for this task. We're told that Captain Stevens is essentially a stump in reality, and his brain is simply hooked up to the Source Code (or something.) Why the audience should care for his plight is once again beyond me. Up to this point, his behavior has been far from endearing. Cap Stevens tells his superiors to unplug him and let him die after his mission is complete. They comply. I yawn and wonder how long it would have taken a Chicago area detective to solve this mystery and catch the terrorist.<br /><br />Fortunately for those watching this tripe, Duncan Jones isn't particularly interested in much of it. He's much more interested in exploring what Source Code is, what the implications are, and of course establishing an overall tone an atmosphere that's altogether quite appealing, which is really no surprise coming off of Moon. Jones all but gives away who the terrorist is in the opening minutes of the film, which allows him to focus the central mystery instead on what exactly is happening with Colter Stevens. Unfortunately, not even Duncan's touches can help the bulk of this train wreck of a screenplay, which simply didn't allow for it. One can see plainly what kind of film Duncan could have made out of this premise, had he written the script himself instead of merely trying to put band-aids on it. What we're left with is a rather boring, run of the mill thriller, with the requisite love story tacked on for good measure, with only mere flashes of an interesting, thought provoking science fiction story telling.<br /><br />Of course, Colter Stevens is able to find the bomber, and convince Captain Goodwin to send him back one more time, so that his consciousness can live on in Sean Fentress' body and continue his flimsy romance with Christina. What's funny is that I've heard over and over again that this is a happy ending, and that the film actually suffers for it. I'm not sure how this is possible.<br /><br />The film establishes that Stevens is living the last eight minutes of Fentress' life in a tangential timeline, which is how he's able to continue existing happily ever after at the end. What this means is that Colter Stevens essentially killed Sean Fentress so that his consciousness could inhabit Fentress' body and continue living as a normal, intact human being. What's more, he manipulates Christina, who explicitly states she had feelings for whoever Fentress was before Colter's invasion. She thinks she's finally gotten her man, but that isn't true at all. So, for those keeping score, this film ends with our hero essentially willingly killing another man in a tangential universe, just so he can continue to live a happy existence with a woman who's really in love with the original Fentress.<br /><br />Oh, and all of those times Colter failed to stop the bomber? Well, all of those tangential timelines had to have continued on, which means thatthe terrorist was most likely allowed to carry out his plot unencumbered numerous times; killing God knows how many people in the process.<br /><br />It's a pretty decidedly dark moral and ethical note to end the film on, and Duncan Jones should be applauded for lending the script the narrative threads needed to get there, and for having the stones to pull it off. The ending of the film, and trying to figure out what the hell Jeffrey Wright was doing with his character, are the only things worth thinking about when the credits begin to roll.<br /><br />The acting in this film is categorically awful across the board. Jake Gyllenhaal is no leading man, and here he seems to be trying to reach Nicholas Cage levels of ridiculous. His facial expressions are hilarious in this picture. I generally like Michelle Monaghan, but she's given absolutely nothing to do here, except spit out pitiful dialogue, stare doe-eyed at Jake, and be the typical female object most films reduce the female lead to. The film would have been better served ditching the love story altogether. I'm fairly certain Vera Farmiga was on some sort of sedative during principal photography. The aforementioned Jeffrey Wright goes completely off the rails here, playing the role of mad scientist at about a 15 when the story really only calls for a level no higher than 7. Wright's performance here is all-time bad. In all honesty, it's probably worth sitting through the entirety of this insipid movie just for the ten minutes or so of screen time Wright gets, that's how preciously crappy it is. We're talking Elizabeth Berkley in Showgirls levels of suck, here.<br /><br />Photographically, the film is beautiful, which is to be expected from Jones. The guy is a gifted craftsman, and shot for shot this film oozes style on a Ridley Scott-esque level. I also can't help but love all of the different small moments he explicitly added to the film, such as the reveal of how Stevens communicates with his commanding officers, and the aforementioned ending. If only there were more of those moments sprinkled throughout.<br /><br />Somehow, this film has been well recieved by both critics and audiences, which means that an incredibly creative Duncan Jones will get to keep making movies with studio money behind them. For that reason alone, I suppose I'm grateful for this films existence.<br /><br />** 1/2 out of *****<br /><br />If you would like to watch some truly good sci-fi, I would recommend any of these over Source Code:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00845MRKE Blade Runner 30th Anniversary Collector's Edition (4-Disc Blu-ray / DVD +UltraViolet Digital Copy Combo Pack)]]<br />[[ASIN:B002T9H2ME Moon [Blu-ray]]]<br />[[ASIN:B004RE29T0 Alien [Blu-ray]]]<br />[[ASIN:B000NOKJF4 A Scanner Darkly [Blu-ray]]]<br />[[ASIN:B002SJIO5E District 9 [Blu-ray]]]<br />[[ASIN:B00005JKEX The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the Eighth Dimension]]

B005LAIHSG|3.0|Considering that this is Rupert Sander's first time directing a movie, I have to applaud his effort. How he landed some big names (Chris Hemsworth, Ian McShane, Kristen Stewart *ahem*) on his first film, I don't know. Something else that brought large attention to this curious collaboration was the good marketing. I didn't expect such a new director to have such a large impact the first time 'round. That was done well.<br /><br />Despite the luring marketing, there were several problems with it once I actually saw the movie. There are various scenes in the trailers that never appeared in the movie (unless they will come in future editions or alternate endings). Also, it was falsely commended for having amazing, cinematic battle scenes. However, the reality is that the battles (save one or two) didn't live up to the cute title acronym (SWATH). They were very mediocre, compared to others from medieval movies.<br /><br />While most battle scenes were not choreographed uniquely enough, the filming angles and cinematography were tasteful. Some scenes went so far as to make me beg for 3D, but there weren't enough to warrant the \\"upgrade.\\" The CGI was amazing with the animals, fairies, troll, and shard soldiers. Now, the costume designers made a name for themselves. From the Huntsman to Gus, each costume was well-thought and gave each character good context.<br /><br />Speaking of character, there were several golden eggs. Hemsworth, for example, proves his worth once again as the Huntsman, layering grief from his wife's death with his tired, unmotivated way of battle, until Snow White rekindles his hope in something beyond the black reign of Ravenna. Kristen Stewart's acting performance, however, closely resembles the previous sentence: long and eventually boring. She seems to tell rather than show, in many circumstances. While she certainly is pale, I believe Sanders would be better off having chosen a different heroine. (Hailee Steinfeld, who's proven wrong those concerned with her age, or, dare I say it, Saiorse Ronan, maybe? She'd look good in black hair)<br /><br />While this is definitely not the style of Tim Burton, I still wouldn't recommend taking children to see this. There are several disturbing scenes near the beginning, regarding the Queen stealing beauty. There is likewise a lot of battle violence throughout the movie, and that is not good for young eyes. The Queen disrobes twice, showing only her upper back, so be warned.<br /><br />Because of the 2D, and Kristen Stewart's performance, I'd say you won't miss much if you wait until it comes to dvd. It's worth it in theaters, but much, much more so at Redbox.ned with her age, or, dare I say it, Saiorse Ronan, maybe?

B004EPYZT4|1.0|I never thought I would say this but this movie makes the original Conan the Barbarian movie look like a major academy awards winner. Once you get past the nice sets, there's no heart or soul. It's like Star Wars, with characters so thin that if they turn sideways, they disappear. Even the music is forgettable. Give us motives, theology and a feeling of popular culture next time. As much as they ripped off from the original flick, you'd think this would be a winner, but except for the born on the battlefield scene, this goes rapidly nowhere much. I always thought I could write and direct a Conan movie and now I know I could do better than this. Crom on his mountain laughs at this movie and so do I.

B0076L9W9Q|2.0|I'm going to start like everyone else by saying.....I love Halestorm! I've seen them in concert and have the debut, the live cd/dvd and even the phsyical copy of the ReAnimate EP. Lzzy is the voice that rock music has been desperately needing, Arejay's drumming blows me away.<br /><br />That being said this is album has been severely dumbed down, lyrically. Don't let Love Bites(So Do I) fool you, and for that matter the three tracks after it. Their first album was strikingly clever with It's not you, I Get Off, and Familiar Taste of Poison. Nowhere on \\"Strange Case of....\\" will you hear anything remotely close to Familiar Taste of Poison.<br /><br />I have tried to listen to this whole album several times and have succeeded. However, the whole thing falls apart after \\"Freak Like me.\\" Once i got to 'Beautiful with You' i thought maybe it was just a fluke, but the song after it is ten times worse. 'In your room' sounds like something a junior high kid or Taylor Swift wrote.<br />I am absolutely amazed at the 5 star reviews here, did anyone else even hear the lyrics on this cd?<br />Perhaps this will grow on me over time, I just really miss the clever song writing of the debut.

0345803485|1.0|... don't read this book.  Instead, read the many witty and clever one-star reviews about this book.  Like all of the other one-star reviewers, I cannot fathom how this idiotic book became a best-seller.  Publishers must have some criteria other than good writing, interesting characters, a plot, etc., to publish a book, hype it beyond all reason and somehow dupe millions of Americans into buying, and presumably reading, this book.  There are lots and lots of better books out there.  Don't waste your time with this one.
0385342063|2.0|I managed to get thru the first 50 pages of drivel and decided it just wasn't going to keep my attention.  Footnotes were annoying and the plot was pretty dull.  If it's not Becky Bloomwood, I'm guessing I'm not going to like it much!

B0085W6II8|5.0|First off, when I heard these two musicians were teaming up...<br />I scratched my head and said: \\"What?\\".<br /><br />This is a GREAT musical collaboration<br />between Steve Hackett (formerly of Genesis) and Chris Squire<br />(from what's left of \\"so-called\\" Yes).<br /><br />Amazing musical textures and soundscapes...and amazing vocals and harmonies.<br /><br />Hoping for more collaborations by these two awesome and legendary MUSICIANS!
B0006419J6|5.0|I Robot is the action-involved mystery based on Issac Asimov's THREE LAWS OF ROBOTICS and the character setting of Dr. Susan Calvin one of the characters often appear in Asimov's novels about robot and robotics. Like many of the Asimov novels, robots which seem to be deviating from the laws is the main theme of the plot. The plot reminds me of one of the Asimov's novels ROBOT AND THE EMPIRE in which the robot acted after all to observe the laws, the way humans have not imagined.<br /><br />Movie plot indeed modernized 62-year-old sci-fi classic. Will Smith plays the role of a cop, who detests robots and acts upon his instincts, who is just like the guy as we have seen in previous signature Will Smith roles such as INDEPENDENCE DAY and MEN IN BLACK series. Robots in this films look so real partly because the robotics today have been developed in the way such robots can be feasible in near future. Nursing robots in particular may soon become like household appliances. What if these robots become defiant and have the mind on their own? So the movie provides us realistic near future scary stories. Much scarier than that of Alien or Predator series. Dr. Alfred Lanning played by James Cromwell gives the story depth and gravity. His character in this film reminds me a bit of late Steve Job of Apple Computer. Overall the film is Will Smith wonderland. The movie makes us think about what is the difference between a robot and a human. If robot has a mind of its own are we prepared to be their friends or enemies?<br /><br />Verdict: Not a straight adaptation of Asimov classic but it has stand-alone appeal.<br />Rating: 92 out of 100<br />Recommended for: Will Smith fans. Action Sci-fi fans such as Blade Runner, Independence Day, and Matrix series.

B007O3QC8K|5.0|For years conductors have celebrated the fact that the truth shouldn't get in the way of a good story.  The story has always been that Bruckner knew he wouldn't live to finish the 4th movement of his symphony and poured everything into his third movement as a moving farewell.  A nice story, but totally untrue.  The ending of the third movement in E minor (for a D minor symphony) clearly shows that he intended more (and without a finale the symphony always feels like a promised unfulfilled).<br />Bruckner worked very hard on his 4th symphony for several years (actually hastening his death) that he had over 500 measures completed of the last movement (whether fully orchestrated or in short score) and left a book of musical sketches related to the movement as well.  The problem was that, after his death, many people were allowed to go through his house and take \\"souvenirs\\", including pages of this last movement (which were thought to never be usable without him alive).  So, much of his fourth movement disappeared, and what was left couldn't convincingly be completed.<br />Over the years, however, those missing pages began to turn up at auction or in private collections, enough so that a finale can now be completed.  And over 500 measures in the 600-measure finished finale are Bruckner's own.  Best of all it is convincing and sounds just like Bruckner.  There is no reason now that the symphony should be performed without it's finale.<br />Rattle has done a wonderful job with this movement and it belongs in any serious Bruckner fan's collection.
0345803485|1.0|I was intrigued by the hype and bought the book. I have a cold, and I thought it would be a diverting read. Oh, was I wrong.<br /><br />This is a ridiculous story. One of the \\"heroine's\\" most annoying phrases is \\"holy hell!\\" She swears like a 10-year-old. This, while she's being serviced by the impossibly fabulous central character. Holy Hell?<br /><br />And the \\"hero\\" is also absurdly wealthy, gorgeous, urbane, accomplished, etc., and yet is fascinated with the heroine, who is an utter mediocrity.<br /><br />This book sucks, and not in the good way: It will neither get you off nor clean your floors. Bypass this dreadful dog! It's a waste of money. Seeing that it has two sequels makes me unutterably weary. I couldn't get past the first quarter of this one. Aaaaaaaaaggggggggghhhhhh!
0345803485|3.0|Ok, They were interesting. I really liked the books, despite the repetitave writing and overused phrases. I have an amazing gift of skimming when I read to bypass some of the unimportant stuff. By the 3rd book though, I found myself skimming over more and more. The author just repeats, and repeats, and repeats the scenes and dialoge throughout the triliogy. I did like the story itself, but not one of the best I have read. This would have been much better without the 3rd book, and because the author dragged on through book 3, it took away from how much I liked the 1st book.

I think someone should buy this writer a Thesaurus.  How many times can she use the same words and phrases? answer: over and over and over and over... (my \\"inner goddess\\" wanted to hurl).  I had a really hard time getting through the book.  I kept hoping it would get better, and was ultimately disappointed.  The whole thing was so very very dull.<br /><br />The characters are completely absurd, and annoying beyond all reason. Even the names are ridiculous. Anastasia? omg.. how much more bad romance novel can you get with that one? And him... the 28 year old emotionally wrecked billionaire? Yeah... uh huh... sure.<br /><br />The \\"story\\" is no better. Wait... was there a story? Let's see... dumb girl meets rich guy.  Dumb girl thinks rich guy is creepy, but hot. Hot hot hot. So dumb girl will do anything he wants, well, because he's just so darn hot. (again... please can we get a few new words?)<br /><br />And the sex scenes. Really... people found this exciting? You have got to be kidding me. I thought it was all pretty vanilla, and incredibly predictable. And again... completely unbelievable.<br /><br />I don't get the hype at all.

B002UZ5JJU|1.0|I love chick lit and was really looking forward to reading this book. I recently read \\"The single girls to do list\\" and thought it was great.  However, \\"I heart new york\\" was just awful.  I could barely finish it. It started out strong, but then just became ridiculous and the main character was not likeable at all.  Also, I'm surprised that the author didn't do more research on American speech (or that the editors didn't catch the mistakes).  How many Americans use words/phrases like \\"queue\\"?  Oversights like that just seemed a bit sloppy to me.

B0084DISCM|5.0|I have been waiting for this movie to come out on Blu Ray forever. The picture and sound quality has REALLY improved. There is nothing extra on the disk compared to the original unrated dvd version but if you like the movie I highly recommend getting the Blu Ray edition. Hopefully the price will come down on this soon but I could not wait ($25 at this time). I am not disappointed at all with my purchase. I hope this review helps you.
B005G4TJI4|1.0|I can't see how anybody who grew up watching the 80's cartoon could like this. Regardless, grading this movie on it's own, it did have a very cool premise. But its execution was painful to sit through. For starters, it focuses on Shia LaBeouf's character way too much. Why do we care about him having job interviews and what his parents think? Did that have to be the focus of half the movie?<br /><br />Beyond that, I wanted to watch this movie with my kids, and there was multiple unnecessary swear words throughout. I'm not being a prude here, it was gratuitous use of \\"holy s h * t\\" and stuff like that. It's one thing if it's necessary for some intense scene, but this was just casual tossing around of swear words. Hey Optimus Prime, how the beep you doing, what a beeping nice day isn't it?<br /><br />As for the transformers themselves, Sentinal Prime, who is activated after (thousands of) years of sleep after crash landing on the moon, wakes up, and is immediately barked orders at and questioned by this human intelligence leader. Instead of his first response being \\"who are you, where am I, what's going on here?\\" he simply very casually answers her like \\"yeah well the reason is blah blah blah\\". It made no sense.<br /><br />As a side note, this summer they're already re-booting other franchises like Batman and Spiderman, can we please fire all the writers/directors for the last 3 transformers movies and start again please!?
0399159029|5.0|Philip Kerr's latest Bernie Gunther novel, Prague Fatale, finds our hero dragooned into the services of the Third Reich by no less that Reinhold Heydrich, allegedly to investigate a murder at Heydrich's Czech home but, in true Kerr fashion, doubles back on itself to service a variety of Reichian purposes.<br /><br />All the Kerr trademarks are here -- the seamless blending of fiction and well-research history, the wise-cracking and humor worthy of Chandler and Hammett, and naturally, a beautiful and doomed female interest.  The thing is a joy to read.<br /><br />According to the back story, Gunther was born about 1898, served in the German army in World War I, became a policeman and detective in Wiemar Germany, was pulled into the service of the Third Reich, serving in the East and performing sundry other services for a series of Nazi unmentionables, before escaping to Argentina and Cuba after World War II, which means Bernie is in his early 60s.  One hopes that Kerr has left unwritten enough Gunther adventures to keep this series going on for a long, long time.  Gunther's life was probably hell for him but it's a positive delight for readers.
B00425S1H8|5.0|Finally a USB to serial that works with Windows 7 64 bit  without any issues. I have tried several from different brand and wasn't successful. This one worked right out of the box. Great buy!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for it to come out on kindle fire for so long I cant believe its finally here.<br />I am so so so happy.<br />yaaaaaaaaay.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Just watched Snow White and the Huntsman and I don't know how Ebert gave that steaming pile 31/2 stars and John Carter 21/2.  I really don't understand how anyone could walk away from the theater not jazzed by this epic.  It was fantastic.  The actors were perfect especially the beautiful princess and the guy who played John Carter was great.  It was fun, fun, fun, fun!  I've read the marketing team or maybe it was the filmmakers arrogance that caused this movie to faulter at the box office but it's a shame.  The title is terrible, everybody knows it.  The name may as well be a brand of toilet paper it has no meaning.  Princess of Mars is perfect and John Carter of Mars is good too.  The movie is a grand adventure and the filmmakers owned a tripod thank God unlike many modern movie makers.  It was well written too.  I just don't get why Disney didn't pull out all the stops on this one.  They easily could have had a great win.  What a wonderful movie.  I hope it someday becomes the classic it deserves to be.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great free game for the whole family.  easy to get more points by downloading other free fun games.  glad we downloaded it.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Great for my daily commute and when I' m sitting around waiting for an appointment.  Like how it marks the counters in the sides and the ease of use.  There are a lot of puzzles included to make it worth the time you will spent sucked into it.
B007C4E1R0|5.0|Sad to know the series is ended by at the same time it's good to see everything resolved. This book isn't as \\"Hype\\" as the others but remember is a a wrap up. It really let's you see who the real victim of this story is.
B0086700CM|5.0|I don't have anything to say just download the graphics are awesome and great for the kindle I would recomend. this game to anyone who loves action
B0086700CM|5.0|thanks for putting temple run on the kindle fire!!!!!!!<br />everyone needs to get this app !!!<br />this is sooo fun i love it
B003O86FMW|5.0|Gripping story of the heroines continued survival.  It is a book that you cannot put down and worth the read, so long as you have read the first book of this series.<br /><br />Beryl Whelan, Medford NJ
B004DARF6A|5.0|The most interesting thing about rewatching this classic is to see how Chaplin invents cinematic technique as he goes.  The selective use of speech and deco-expressionist production design are both striking.
0345803485|2.0|This book has created such a buzz that I thought I'd give it a read. Overall it was disappointing and terribly written. Unless you LOVE cheesy romance novels this book will leave you wanting more.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I actually found the book entertaining and while it wasn't all consuming or the best written novel I've ever read I was able to escape into the world of \\"Grey\\" for a few hours.  I've seen negative comments about the unbelievable characters or a plot copy of Twilight minus the supernatural, however, its a fictional book, I don't need it to be reality or to have realistic characters/events persay to enjoy the read.  Most romance novels don't have very realistic characters to begin with so why would Shades of Grey be different. I somehow doubt if any romance author created realistic characters they sell any books; its the fantasy that draws us to these novels, not the ordinary.  As for mimic reviews related to the Twlight series, I didn't find it as such.  Yes, there is the completely pure shy somewhat awkward girl who falls for the big bad crazy messed up man but I think that's about where the similarities end.<br /><br />On to the erotic nature of the books...upon hearing friends talk about the books underlying eroticism, I actually expected more.  Don't get me wrong, there is sex, alot of it, some of it more than kinky \\"F^%*ery\\" as the characters call it, however, it's nothing more than you'd find in many other romance novels in my opinion (I've read more erotic scenes in Nora Roberts books, just saying).<br /><br />Regardless, I have and would recommend the book to others. I enjoyed the read, am currently almost thru the 2nd novel, and have purchased the third.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is really freaking sweet. awesome game and very very addicting. I cant stop playing it!! really really fun.
B0059XTV4Y|5.0|The 1st time I saw it, I felt that was a movie I'd easily forget. Surprisingly, after a second chance I gave W.E. (DVD), it turned out to be more than a movie. IMO it is a beautifully painted picture.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|When I started this book I couldn't put it down. It read so easily, and the drama kept me wanting more. I then went on to read her Providence Book Serires, which I also breezed through. Waiting for her next release....can't wait!

1439107955|5.0|First the back cover flap summary, where an average reader spends eight seconds to decide if this book is worthy of being read:<br /><br />In 'The Emperor of all Maladies', Siddhartha Mukerjee, physcian, researcher and award-winning science writer, examines cancer with a celular biologist's precision, a historical perspective, and a biographer's passion. the result is an astonishingly lucid and eloquent chronicle of a disease humans have lived with - and perished from - for more than five thousand years.<br /><br />Cool stuff, i am sold! But what is this? This book is the size of a phone book! If cancer is a hurricane, this must be the phone book of all lives devastated and destroyed over the past 5000 years. Sid, in one of his interviews regretted that his entire manuscript that was three times as large was trimmed down by his publishers. Note to self: Thank publisher!<br /><br />Though the book traces cancer's origin to about 5000 years ago (the first known and documented case is of an egyptian princess Altossa who suffers from breast cancer which is eventually excised by her slave), it put's a heavy spotlight on the last 100 years. the advent of modern science, chemistry and radiology pitted against cancer in a race with time.<br /><br />Of fascinating interest are the introduction of palliative care, radiation therapy in chicago, the 'Jimmy Fund' out of Boston - the epicenter of cancer research, the birth of practical chemistry out of the cotton dyeing industry, leukemia in malnourished workers in British India, contributions of Yella Subbarao Pragada to the understanding of energy source for cells and hence their growth, the politics of fund raising and it's direct impact on cancer research, parallels with AIDS research, the exhilarating success in breast cancer screening and treatment and some more! Not to mention 'radical' surgery and high-dose chemotherapy that served as the two most misunderstood sciences of their generation.<br /><br />There is no spoileralert that i can issue. There is no big-bang cure for cancer. But it does end in a remarkable understanding of cancer. The author admits that cancer is the outer boundary of cell division and that it is *required* fecundity for human survival. To control it is to be counter-intuitive to our own survival trajectory through the ages. The cell's ambition to adapt, multiply and survive *sometimes* impinges on life of the organs that nurture it or become new metastasized homes.<br /><br />This does not sound like a cheerful ending but the intensity of ground breaking research will bring relief for many that are living through the nightmare. Of special mention being the latest in genome mapping.<br /><br />The biography of this disease is not *only* made up of biographies of thousands that mostly succumbed and perished, but the same thousands that valiantly fought it along with their trusted physicians and loved ones with an undying hope and the greatest ambition of their lives of simply seeing the light of another day.<br /><br />It is in that break-through of the human spirit, that this book delivers an all-out punch.
B0086700CM|3.0|I searched this app for my Kiele fire a few weeks ago but was disappointed when it wasn't avaliable on amazon yet. (I have an ipod touch 2nd gen. but thought that it would be more fun playing temple run with a bigger screen.) I went on the amazon appstore today and saw that it was number 1 free app! so obviously I got it. I sprang my first two times playing it getting my highscores and accomplishments I have on my ipod. I closed the app to go eat dinner. afterward I came back upstairs to read on my kindle but I love this game and it was just too tempting! so I opened the app to play but soon realized that whenever I tilted my device to pick up coins it would stay in the same spot. I could turn and slide fine but I just couldn't tilt (which gets to be a problem when you get further in the game and there are parts or the temple that are very narrow on the left or right.) I even tried turning the darn thing upsidesown! I checked the apps settings and tried everything I even tried to fix my kindle's settings (assuming that there was anything wrong with it of course.) now the game is no fun which is a shame because I loved this game and wanted it to be better on a larger screen.
0307951529|5.0|I have been following Chris for a long time.  The first information product I ever bought from him was the Unconventional Guide to Working For Yourself. I have been a follower ever since.<br /><br />When I stumbled upon that Unconventional Guide I was unhappy with my work life and needed a change.  Here was a guy that had set a very public goal of visiting every country in the world by the time he was 35 and better yet he was finding an ingenious way of travel hacking his way there.  He isn't the first to come up with the idea of travel hacking but he put it on the map. [Thank Chris for killing the US Mint dollar coin trick].<br /><br />The book has a great flow to it.  Short little stories, advice, application of advice.  The point of the book to me was to affirm to the reader that the most important part of starting a business is making the plunge and just doing it.  Go forth. Do.  There is a lot of tips and tricks along the way, but they don't matter as much as getting out of your seat and going forth.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoy Chris's writing style.  It flows very nicely and you don't have to struggle to get his point.<br /><br />If you are serious about quiting your job and taking control of your life I would read this book and [[ASIN:0982986270 Quitter]].  Then go forth and DO.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Draw Something is just like Pictionary.  We have a word, we draw it.  The person we play with guesses the word.  It's a team effort.<br /><br />I've heard of this game for the longest time, but it wasn't available for the Kindle Fire.  I just noticed it a few days ago and downloaded the free version.  Be forewarned: this game is addictive!<br /><br />We can have lots of games going at the same time.  Invite friends through Facebook or using your email address.  It's either or, we can't play friends we invite through Facebook *and* through our email address at the same time.  I wish we could.  No friends?  No problem.  Invite a random player.<br /><br />If you're worried about being stuck mid-game when real life calls, don't.  It's okay to put down anytime . . . if you have the willpower.  The game will pick up where you started when you come back, which could even be the next day.<br /><br />The biggest drawback?  If we go the email route, it doesn't remember our email address and password when we log out, which isn't a problem if you never log out.  I, on the other hand, play friends through my email account and Facebook.  At least it remembers the Facebook password.<br /><br />Ads take a good while to load.  I decided to actually buy the paid version after only a few days.  It's that good, because I don't usually pay for apps when there are free versions available.  If you've never tried this, it's worth a download.  You've nothing to lose and so much fun to gain.
B007KB15BA|5.0|Get get enough of this one...Blood of nations might be a frog hair better, but as I get to know this one it might get to be as good, or better!
B0074MZSWW|4.0|Pretty good recording. This is their first album, i like it and listen to it in my car. Overall it's pretty good, no surprises if you have been listening to the songs on youtube.
1401302378|5.0|This book gets to the heart of the modern consumer who has been inundated by various selling techniques and is now overloaded.  Many friends of mine, exhibiting this reality, no longer answer their home phone out of certainty that the voice on the other end will be a phone solicitor.  Get this book if you want to take your sales and marketing into the 21st century.
0345803485|5.0|I have never seen an X rated movie, I've never read romance novels, but all the buzz about this book and the blushing faces of those who've read it made me take the leap.....boy am I glad I did!  WARNING:  you may want to buy all three books at once, when you finish the first, you will be \\"hungry\\" for the second and third.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This app is a very good one as a &quot;study on the go&quot; or at home.  Very good choices in translations.

B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app it is always as accurate as our weather will allow. And just so handy to use!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Seriously love this game,  just wish kindle fire would get caught up and update this game. Tired of the game telling me to start over to receive updates and nothing happens. Could we please get this<br /> accomplished.  Desperate to play more. Thank you.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This is a very nice upgrade to my existing 92 mm tower cooler that just was not up to heavy duty use (video encoding) on an older Core 2 Quad Q6600 @ 3.2 GHz (LGA 775).  The older cooler was a giving me idle temps at about 45C and load temps of about 85C at warm ambient temps. This was even with AS5 thermal paste.  The hyper 212+ gives me idle temps at about 37C and load temps at about 57C. This was also with AS5 thermal paste.  For $30, I wish I would have gone with this cpu cooler sooner.  It has only been about 4 years since I built this computer (my workhorse, and war horse). 120mm coolers were really expensive and not that common in the old days.<br /><br />Of course, the hyper 212+ required me to remove the motherboard and the old back plate under the motherboard. I knew this going into this upgrade.  This is not a con and a good thing to have because stock Intel coolers use push pin technology and just clip to the motherboard holes.  My old cooler had a back plate that was stuck on with two sided tape. After careful prying around the perimeter, it came off. The new back plate of the hyper 212+ is a lot sturdier being metal (hence leave the insulation in place on the back plate).  This back plate is needed for tower coolers, and I am glad it came with one. The mounting hardware is good quality, but the instructions are simple and could be better with clearer pictures.  Watch a video from youtube if you need help.<br /><br />For new builds, install this back plate before mounting your motherboard in your case, unless you have a case that sufficiently exposes the under side of the motherboard at the cpu.  I have this in an Antec 900 case with a Gigabyte P35-DS3L motherboard with no clearance issues.
B0086700CM|5.0|Very additing! My only complaint is that sometimes it jumps when I try to turn or slides. Maybe I need to adjust my sensitivity.
B002MT3CIY|1.0|As a die-hard Floyd fan, I couldn't wait for this video to originally come out back in 1989.  What a disappointment is was then, and it still is.  Imagine how great it would be to see Pink Floyd in concert as they appeared live - in real-time motion.  Instead, the producers of this video applied an annoying slow-motion effect to the picture that lasts virtually the entire concert.  Instead of capturing the feel of a real concert performance, this video is like a bad dream where you've been drugged and time is moving by at half-speed.<br /><br />What would be fantastic is if Mr. Gilmour were to revisit the original video masters and create a new version without this lousy slow-motion video effect.  Maybe if enough of us fans demand it and make our voices heard the band will consider this?  In which case, let's also see the original concert in its entirety.  There's nothing worse than giving us the first two minutes of Shine On You Crazy Diamond then cutting it off just as things start to get good.
0698116496|3.0|I ordered this used copy of Goodnight Gorilla and it was supposed to be in Excellent (like new) condition. The book cover was well creased and edges were torn. It is a well used book. Misrepresented the products condition.

B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, very funny. I thought it was great up until a horrible twist that just ruined the story! Which happens to come at the very end. I was upset over it but I will still continue with the series. Hopefully nothing like that happens again.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so awesome that I couldn't stop playing for 3days well you because I just got it but it is a awesome well not awesome extremely awesome.
B0086700CM|5.0|Can't stop playing!  Very addicting and fun! Sometimes I'm tempted to purchase additional money, but I resist the urge and earn it myself!  Nice job with this one developers!
B00756GKBA|3.0|Madonna's stardom ranks among the longest from her peers starting their illustrious careers back in the mid 1980's - just think, where is now Janet Jackson, Duran Duran, Eurythmics, Whitney Houston, or even U2, for that matter? This, of course, does not necessarily mean that Madonna's artistic quality will always be on top. She will just never be satisfied with merging with the average - at least in terms of sales. Maybe that's why she so hard tried to prevent \\"MDNA\\" from leaking to the internet.<br /><br />The long-awaited record came along after a four-year hiatus since the last proper album, \\"Hard Candy\\". As is usually the case with Madge albums, first impressions may be misleading. And as, for example, with Coldplay, there are legions of die-hard fans, who differ considerably in their opinions, often have quite opposite view on many songs or the album as a whole. The debut \\"Madonna\\" (1983), scored no major applause, but is now considered a timeless classic. Albums like \\"Erotica\\", \\"Bedtime Stories\\", \\"American Life\\" and even \\"Hard Candy\\" were not received warmly, but in time, gained recognition and almost cult status among groups of fans. The same can be expected of \\"MDNA\\".<br /><br />Indeed, if \\"Hard Candy\\" seemed too robotic and cold four years ago, now the same can be told of \\"MDNA\\". In the last four years, the world became an even tougher and more selfish place, which, curiously, rendered \\"Hard Candy\\" a more friendly, well-aging record.<br /><br />\\"MDNA\\"'s first singles \\"Give Me All Your Lovin'\\" and \\"Girl Gone Wild\\", though will probably remain also the best songs here - the former a girlish, playful anthem, the latter drawing from previous hits such as \\"Celebration\\" and \\"Hung Up\\". The two singles are also the most exciting tunes. The \\"Gang Bang\\", meeting with considerable raves, does not cut it for melody lovers and the second half of the album is decent, but sometimes getting just too simple, like in \\"Ooh La La You're My Superstar, Ooh La La That's What YouAre\\" - what's that, exactly?<br /><br />Anyway, Madonna's DNA - hinted at MDNA - of 2010's is simple in essence, still drawing attention and at the same time as simplistic as many of today's youths. Suffices to say that it's an album which fits all too well in 2012. And it means that it will not measure up to her best work.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was another person who got sucked into the hype surrounding these books.  Unfortunately, I bought the 3-book bundle instead of just buying the first one to see if it was any good.  These were quite possibly some of the worst books I've ever read!<br />Absolutely nothing likeable or believable about either of the main characters. Ana was a big snore, and Christian....I couldn't find one redeeming quality about this character.  Controlling, selfish, abusive, condescending.....I could go on and on!<br />The sex scenes were repetitious and B-O-R-I-N-G!!!!  I found myself skipping ahead past every sex scene, because basically, if you read one of the sex scenes in these books, they all pretty much play out exactly the same.<br />And yes, since I paid for all 3 books in the Kindle bundle, I went ahead and read all 3...there's 3 days of my life wasted that I'll never get back.<br />Save your money, don't buy these books, they are truly atrocious!!
B00881VLCE|1.0|This app doesn't work well on the Kindle Fire. It's difficult to drag the pieces to the puzzle board and ALL the free puzzzles are kittens. You have to pay to have more interesting or artistic puzzles. I uninstalled it.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Totally enjoyable.  In the days of reality television, it was nice to just kick back and watch the stories unfold.  Sherlock is a bit out there, but the balance of Watson is just genius. The axillary characters are wonderful additions, but the Moriarty character is brilliant.<br />Each episode was interesting but I have to admit the third episode of Season 2 was my favorite.  I actually watched it twice to see if I could figure out what happened.<br />The only drawback to the series is that sometimes the dialogue is softly spoken and quick and you can miss some of the conversation.  Thank goodness for the DVR.<br />Thank you PBS, now I have both seasons in my collection and can't wait for Season 3.  More, please, sir.

B0086700CM|5.0|Temple is an adventure game where your objective is to collect coins and run as far as you can. I find this a very well done game. The powerups and store are organized well. The in-app purchases are tempting, but they do not ruin the game. My only flaw is that it has NO story to it. I'm a guy who likes games with a story. I thought maybe a few cutscenes would be good but that's just me. Overall, it is an excellent game that is fun to kill some time.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|This movie should be required in American High School History Classes. Great Movie, stunning!!!  It clearly is not about the acting although I don't understand previous critical reviews. This movie goes waaay beyong acting!!!

B000001DYA|4.0|This album isn't as good as the other reviewers claim. At this point Blue Cheer sounded like an elite garage band, part of its charm, and I really didn't like most of the chosen covers. However, I was 13 when this album came out, and remember the 60s quite well. I give this album a thumbs up for being an historic musical blast from the past, and another one for simply reminding me why I fell in love with Rock music when I was young. I have a seventeen year old who plays bass, and if he and his friends ever produce an album like this I'll die happy.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I've been waiting for a Gold Box or Lightning Deal on this for a while.  These are what I call \\"black hole\\" movies to me.  I stop and watch them every time they are on TV.  Now I can watch without commercials.  Alien is a classic and simplistic in its horror genre.  Aliens was the followup and of course more impressive but never quite measures up.  Resurrection was Josh Weddon's vision and quite odd if you ask me.  Didn't really enjoy that one but glad to have it on BluRay nonetheless.

B005LAIIRQ|1.0|OK, I'm not going to go into the plot of this piece of crap waste of time movie.  All I gotta say is this piece of crap low life movie was by far the worst movie I've seen since Wrong Turn 4.  And like Wrong Turn 4 guess what everyone dies and the actors in this movie just plain suck.  Serously don't bother wasting your time with this piece of crap movie unless you want to see everyone except 2 people (who I might add die) get eaten by a bunch of wolves.  And on my final note I would like to say that a movie where everyone gets ate by Great White, Tiger, Mako, or some other shark or creature that CANNOT BE kept in captivity would have been a much, much  better idea.  Because at least then the people would be getting ate by something that is declining in population and cannot be re-populated UNLIKE THE GREY WOLF!!!!!!  If your looking for a good movie about a plane crash and a scary wild animal that is mean and eats people SEROUSLY SEE THE EDGE WITH ANTHONY HOPKINS and don't bother wasting your time with this low life piece of crap movie that like Wrong Turn 4 should have never even been created.  Or see Shark Night, that's a good movie where the sharks don't get killed and the hero's survive.  Or see the movie Prey (another movie about survival from wild animals with bad actor's and actress's unlike The Edge) for all I care in NONE OF THOSE MOVIES does everyone die unlike this piece of crap WASTE OF TIME MOVIE.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|I have been a fan of pictocross games for years and this is definitely a nice version. I would like to see the addition of strikes for wrong answers or at the very least an option to tell me how many errors I have at any given time. I hate being 30 minutes into a puzzle only to figure out that I have made a mistake that I cannot find. I play a version on my wife's ipad that gives the option to use strikes or error counts and it really makes a difference.

B005LAIHMW|3.0|There were some funny moments in this film and many women will be able to relate to the scenarios presented.  It was neat how each character's story was interwoven and played out in real-time along with the other characters' stories.<br /><br />The film seems to be an advertisement to have babies, and more babies, and more babies. At least one couple adopts!!!<br /><br />The last half hour of the film consists of the characters swooning over their babies and the comedy went right out the window.

B0000669JL|5.0|This album is the Bob Marley version of The Beatles '1s' CD. It doesn't by any means represent the whole of his output or his musical and ideological viewpoint, just as The Beatles '1s' CD, with nothing from 'Sergeant Pepper' or the second side of 'Abbey Road', by no means gives an overview of The Beatles career. Marley had much to say in his music and only a small fraction of it is here.<br /><br />Nevertheless, just as '1s' is a wonderful set of Beatles' songs, so 'Legend' is an amazing collection of Marley's most commercial work. He had a gift of writing tuneful, entertaining reggae that no-one else has come close to matching. Even those who are not already fans will find that they know many of these tunes, so often have they been played on the radio or at parties, not to mention been covered by other (lesser) artists. They're lightweight but brilliant popular music from a man bursting with talent.<br /><br />If you use this CD to launch yourself into an examination of Marley's other work, and the social and political messages he imparted, then great. I have many CDs of Marley showing his complex and introspective side, his anger and frustration and compassion. They are all terrific and well worth the effort of getting to know, even if not as accessible as this CD.<br /><br />If this turns out to be the only CD of Bob's that you buy, then you have still got some fantastic music from a man who was one of the greatest ever popular musicians not only of the Caribbean but of the world.
0345803485|2.0|All the hype and like many I HAD to find out what it was all about.<br /><br />I am 45. I come from the generation that REALLY read some basic Harlequin Romances or Silhoette Romances and as innocent as I was, always wished they would go farther to dust off my inexperience.  Fast forward 25 years and here it is. Is this the kind of thing \\"mommy's\\" want to read?

So how could it fail?<br /><br />It's the tired tale of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves and nothing was done to make it really interesting or fresh.<br /><br />The actress who played Snow White just didn't do a convincing job.<br /><br />The evil queen is barely in the movie, maybe less than ten minutes.  Snow White and the Huntsman?  The Huntsman didn't have a decent role in the movie.  There was just no magic to this one.  Bland, very bland.

B0053O8AQE|5.0|This is not only my favorite new comedy of the season; it is the best sitcom currently on. I have to add something to the previous comment about the characters and message of the show. Max has always been working class and was resigned to her fate. To make extra money she took a second service job as a baby sitter. Caroline knows there is a better life out there, and is determined to recover it. She sees Max has a talent for baking cupcakes. Caroline has the spirit of enterprise and is taking Max upward; from working for others to starting their own business. That is the positive message of the show. At the end of each episode there is an accounting of where the girls are in their quest to raise the capital needed to get their enterprise launched. Still, I watch the show for Kat Dennings and her provocative dialog. The show is a success. I hope the writers understand why and don't change course.

B00005JKLZ|4.0|THE TIME MACHINE by H.G. Wells really doesn't make that great of a movie if one stays true to the text. After all, H.G. Wells' book was more a commentary on society than a science fiction novel. With that said, THE TIME MACHINE movie directed by Simon Wells is a rocking adventure, full of excitement.<br /><br />The movie stars Guy Pierce (L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, MEMENTO) as Alexander Hartdegen. Hartdegen is a professor at Columbia University and among several eccentricies contains a correspondence with German clerk, Albert Einstein. Hartdegen has an interest in all things mechanical and a strange fascination with time. However, it takes an overwhelming tragedy to focus Hartdegen's energies into building a time machine. He travels into the past and future, but a knock on the head causes him to travel 800,000 years farther into the future than he planned. There he discovers two races of men: the peaceful Eloi and the cannabilistic Morlocks. Alex is faced with a choice and his decision will affect all of time.<br /><br />Simon Wells has done a good job of putting together an action packed science fiction adventure. It is true that the movie does not much resemble his great-grandfather's novel. However, Simon Wells did not write the script. He just had an opportunity to work on something and have a family connection.<br /><br />Anyway, the movie is fairly fast paced and though it does not try to explain time travel (such as the great BACK TO THE FUTURE) and has a few plot holes, the movie is still enjoyable. It's not as good as the 1960 movie starring Rod Taylor, but it's still a nice piece of mind candy.

145210655X|5.0|When we decided on a Star Wars themed nursery, the search for creative and unique items began. The \\"Darth Vader and Son\\" pictorial book has been a perfect addition. Star Wars geeks will love the plays on various scenes while the grandmothers will cry at the more touching pages.
0618526412|4.0|The theme of isolation is at the forefront in McCullers' novel The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, which is set in a rural Southern community in the 1930s. The plot revolves around the stories of several central characters who all gravitate towards the main character, mute John Singer, who has an aura of spirituality and wisdom about him that make others turn to him.  Each has their own sense of longing and emptiness within their soul, and Singer represents the link that gives them spiritual comfort. Despite their differences of each (Mick, Dr. Copeland, Jake Blount, Biff Brannon), all are connected and linked by their need for comfort. Even Singer shares this common feeling of loneliness, as he sees his best friend, Spiros, sent to an asylum within the book's first chapters.<br /><br />The question that The Heart is a Lonely Hunter seems to address is: How do we deal with isolation or sense of loss when we experience it?  Mick, for instance, seems to find peace in music, but comes to trust in Singer as well. Doctor Copeland feels anger and injustice in the world and seeks answers. Others, Jake and Biff, both trust in Singer as a means of expressing their frustrations. Although Singer cannot speak to them, they build a bond, a connection. The book's title is fitting because it is symbolic of each person's search for a connection to share life's experiences--goals, hopes, aspirations, frustrations. Singer is the catalyst for hope.<br /><br />I think many people read The Heart is a Lonely Hunter and see it as \\"depressing\\", but the book is also hopeful at points. Certain tragedies arise that like a punch to the gut, a major letdown, but there is also a sense of hope and resolve within the novel. The author leaves some ambiguity for us to decide how things will go on.<br /><br />McCullers writes with such a descript prose that isn't too flowery, but is poetic and illustrative of the human condition. She takes you right into this small town community. She has such a command for description and transition from one tale to the next that it is an easy and smooth, yet powerful Southern read. Another great read from McCullers is her short story collection that features \\"The Ballad of the Sad Café.\\"

B000FVQLQQ|5.0|Schizophrenia is a mental illness that most Americans know very little about. Schizophrenia is such a complex mental illness that it is quite difficult even to explain and discuss with those who are uneducated about it. Symptons are varied and each person is affected differently. In A BEAUTIFUL MIND, Ron Howard has pulled off an Oscar-worthy job of exploring one man's struggle with the illness through the life of Nobel Prize winner, John Nash. The film skips a great deal of Nash's life. However, in the two and a half hours that the movie runs, the audience is caught up in the life and mentality of Nash. No film can truly do justice to a person's life and achievements. However, movies can educate and inform us of greatness within our midst that would go otherwise unnoticed. A BEAUTIFUL MIND is such a film. Contrary to what some have suggested, the film deals with schizophrenia in a tasteful and thoughtful manner, illumining the audience to the false reality that schizophrenics exist within.<br />Russell Crowe is once again superb and earned another Oscar nomination with his performance of Nash. Though he is often cast as a matinee-idol-type star, films like this illustrate his skill and display that he has become one of Hollywood's elite not solely because of his looks (aka Tom Cruise), but because of his talent.<br /><br />Jennifer Connelly also pulls of an Oscar-worthy performance as Nash's wife. I've been a fan of Connelly since her early days starring in LABYRINTH and it's great to finally see her beginning to receive the recognition she deserves. She more than holds her own against the strong charisma of Russell Crowe.<br /><br />The movie does not have a great deal of time to deal with the relationship between Nash and his wife. Nevertheless, the film briefly touches upon their relationship without becoming sappy.<br /><br />Overall, a wonderful movie with great acting, exploring the horror of schizophrenia and the power of love.

B000W74EQC|5.0|The following behind J.K. Rowling and Harry Potter is tremendous. However, just because a popular and world-famous book is turned into a movie, doesn't mean that the movie will be a success. Nor does it mean the movie will be any good. Often, movies based upon novels are terrible (look at the many bad movies based upon Stephen King stories, for instance). Sometimes, a movie based upon a novel ends up better than the original work (FIELD OF DREAMS or JURASSIC PARK for instance). However, it is a very rare case when a movie based upon a novel succeeds as a piece of cinema and stays true to the original work. HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE is such a film. The film stays true to the novel on which is based and leaves very few details out. It also works quite well as a movie. Even more surprising is that the film successfully introduces the world of Harry Potter to the uninitiated without becoming bogged down in details. The actors do a brilliant job, the special effects are fairly believable, and the cinematography is picturesque. The only major drawback to the film is that the characters aren't completely fleshed out. Of course, complexity of character perhaps is best left out of the first of what will be many films in a series. A delightful film that most are sure to at least half-way enjoy.
B0000AUHOH|1.0|I have been a devoted Trekkie ever since the very first show was broadcast in 1966 and even I despise this film!  I wish I could burn out the memory circuits in my brain which remember it!  Aarghh!  Ack!  Ptui!!
B0085Z8F4A|2.0|Spoilers thar be, Maytees.<br /><br />Is a man created by man still a creature of God or is it a monster? Do we have the right to create meta-human life? What if we are the children of unknown fathers? For answers please consult Frankenstein. For self-important, barely comprehensible drivel please consult Prometheus.<br /><br />Great direction can save poor scripts. A director seduced by CGI shooting an incredibly weak screenplay by an overrated pair of writers will not. How on Earth Lindelof and Spaihts got the gig is beyond me. There are strong writers in Hollywood and others trying to get a break that could have done a better job, a MUCH better job.<br /><br />Ridley Scott, like Spielberg, has forgotten what making a raw, honest movie is like and is far too distracted with how excessive CGI can make it look pretty. Alien was a dark, cold, spartan film set in a bleak, merciless universe. The budget and effects limitations at the time meant that Scott had to use his imagination to create dread. Here he has all the money and effects he can ask for and the resulting film is the polar opposite. Less is more. A filmmaker like Scott should know that. All 4 Alien movies were filmed on a soundstage (save for one 'beach' shot in Alien 3). They were confined and claustrophobic. Prometheus is set in massive, wide-open spaces, which I assume is supposed to make us feel desolate and isolated. But when it cuts back and forth between interior and exterior so much the opposites negate each other, meaning we feel neither confined nor abandoned.<br /><br />The story is set a number of years before Alien in which a bunch of expendable characters (including a lot of nobodies) travel to a distant planet (a 4-year round trip) to find the beings that created life on Earth. When they get there they discover...a load of confusing, muddled nonsense that is far from frightening and is only just barely above mildly interesting.<br /><br />Alien was populated with 7 single or double-syllabled characters that felt real and authentic thanks to their quiet interactions and dialogue. We learned their names and positions quickly. Prometheus has more characters than I can count (some appear out of nowhere and quickly disappear as fast) with some of them not even being coherently named. Not that coherence is this film's strong point.<br /><br />Noomi Rapace is cute as Elizabeth Shaw, the lead scientist who believes in 'The Creators' (the Space Jockey creatures), but she's very miscast. Michael Fassbender as android David is the only other character who gets a notable amount of screen time. You'll care about none of them.<br /><br />Scott once said that the film wasn't a prequel to Alien (after originally announcing that it was) then changed his mind a short while later. If this was supposed to keep us intrigued it didn't work. If anything it only got the confusion going before anyone even saw the movie.<br /><br />It has some lofty ambitions, and succeeds at neither of them. The opening scene of a Creator sacrificing himself at an indefinite point in history to create mankind by putting his DNA into our water is nonsense. Was disintegrating himself the only way of doing this? Could he not have just bled into the primordial soup? Did he create the dinosaurs too? Was it a scene set just after the last ice age? Did they accidentally create primates in the process? Why did they create us in the first place? How did the early civilizations learn of the Creators? Did they visit? Why did they have a star map that led to a planet that was just a testing field?<br /><br />The creation of the famous Xenomorph Alien is so convoluted and preposterous. Let's see if you can follow this:<br /><br />Android David finds a vase of goo in the pyramid/mountain place. He touches it to his finger. He deliberately puts his finger into Holloway's champagne, infecting him as he ingests. Holloway gets sick. Before the symptoms become obvious he mates with his infertile lover Elizabeth.She becomes pregnant and quickly goes into labor. She aborts her 'hell baby' by caesarian section but just leaves it there in the operation room. Some time later the angry Creator is attacked by the full grown hell baby and is consumed by it, to a degree, for unknown reasons. That dead Creator then births a primitive Xenomorph.<br /><br />Pardon me, but that is a load of garbage. I honestly cannot believe something that ludicrous made its way into, what is essentially, an Alien movie. The original had so much purity and mythos. Did Ridley Scott not even watch his own movie for pointers? Lindelof and Spaihts have really painted themselves into a corner with that dumb ending too. When Shaw gets to the real Creator planet she will be the only human being in the film, if that is the way the speculative sequel will go.<br /><br />The mystery of the Space Jockey has been completely ruined. It could have been so much better. But Scott needs to be brought back down to Earth (pun intended) and he should have chosen his writing team more wisely. Still, it was nice to hear Jerry Goldsmith's Alien theme, albeit briefly.She becomes pregnant and quickly goes into labor.

B004SIP9RO|4.0|This movie is pretty much a typical Hollywood forumla romance flick. However, there are a few differences. First, there's John Cusack, a character actor/leading man whose mere presence tends to make even the most meaningless drivel watchable. Thankfully, SERENDIPITY is not a bad movie and Cusack's presence just makes it a little better. What really captured my attention in the film was the question of fate and destiny. Is there a grand scheme to life? The question is answered with a verifying yes, but not after forcing the viewer to analyze the question. Overall, not too bad of a movie. It has a happy ending and is worth viewing to see Cusack and Kate Beckinsale.

0393088774|3.0|I've only read the first two chapters and Dr. Krugman's book \\"End This Depression Now\\" is easy reading and thought provoking.  He first explains the cause of the current economic crisis in the USA (high unemployment) which he concludes is insufficient demand for goods and services and liquidity.  He uses an interesting analogy of a babysitters Coop, where 150 parents are given 20 vouchers for babysitting services which they have to return at the end of the year.  He shows that when the demand for babysitting services is down and the parents hoard their vouchers, the exchange of services stops.  He says that's where we are in our economy.  And then Dr. Krugman says that the solution is for the U.S. Federal Gov't to step in and just spend money hiring people.  So his cause of the economic crisis makes sense, but his solution misses the point.  What solves the problem is not the government, but new goods and services that people want and need.  To solve his \\"babysitter cooperative\\" problem, we don't need the board to give more vouchers to the people, but for the society to create more reasons for the parents to need babysitters.  For example, if there were some great new places to see, great new restaurants to try, new shows to watch, events to attend, then the problem is solved.  Similarly, we don't need government to hire workser and spend money to solve the current economic crisis.  What we need are new products and services to make people and corporations want to buy things.  The reason the 90's and early 2000's were such good times economically, was that we had so many great advances in technology, computers, the internet, on-line shopping, safer and more sophisticated cars with air bags and anti-lock breaks, etc. There were so many new advances such as cell phones and EMAIL and LCD Televisions that people were compelled to buy things which created jobs.  What we need in our economy are new inventions to stimulate demand for products and services.  Then the peoplewill buy things and put people to work.  Dr. Krugman misses this basic concept.  He wants to find a simple solution to economic problems when in fact the solution is not simple at all.  How can we invent the new, new things of today?  Who will do that?  Perhaps if the govennment would spend it's time investing in University and Medical Research, then we can hope for new products and services to be developed.  Imagine if the cure for cancer were found what that would do to our economy!  But overall, from the first two chapters, the book is interesting and well written.

B006GHA9QQ|1.0|Where to start, where to start? OK, the beginning.<br /><br />Like a lot of Phantom fans, I was nervously expectant when I heard that ALW was fashioning a sequal to Phantom of the Opera. Now let me say that I am not a fan of musicals per se. The ONE exception was Phantom, which I fell in love with and saw several times. From the special effects, to the performances of Michael Crawford and his successors, to the wonderfully realized re-telling of the compelling tale, I thought it was a flawless theatrical experience. A good sequal would have been wonderful, but outside of The Godfather, sequals have a spotty history at best. Still...one could hope.<br /><br />My first red flag came when I heard that Love Never Dies was to be set in Coney Island. Coney Island? Novelty acts and roller coasters? For my Phantom? WHAT??? How does one go from the Paris Opera House to Coney freakin' Island? OK, deep breath. It can still work, right?<br /><br />Wrong.<br /><br />Almost everything about Love Never Dies falls flat. First fatal flaw; the Phantom has a pedestrian entrance. Its so pedestrian its basically a non-entrance. Using suspenseful anticipation is a key to great art; Hitchcock was the master, and ALW used it beauitifully in Phantom. Where was the Phantom? Is he watching us now? When will he return? No such element in LND. Although disappointed by this beginning, the opening number itself is wonderful and Phantom-worthy.<br /><br />Second red flag however, occurs during the Phantom's first number and is the Phantom himself. If \\"story\\" is primary, as ALW contends in interviews, how did the Phantom get younger in the intervening 10 years? Indeed, age is a problem with the entire cast. As the story unfolds, Madam Geary is the same age as when we last saw her in Paris, Meg is the same age without having matured emotionally at all, Raoul is the same age, Christine is the same age.<br /><br />As for Raoul, he has been reduced to having become a degenerate gambler and drinker. Theonly interesting thing about him is that he and Christine have managed to have a son, Gustav. Gustav is...wait...wait...10 YEARS OLD. Of course, story being everything for ALW, Gustav COULDN'T be the Phantom's son because we learned in the original that his disfigurement also prevented him from partaking in the \\"Joys of the flesh.\\" That little detail apparently has been forgotten/tossed aside/ignored so that we now understand who little Gustav's real father is. This is not so much a red flag as it is a king sized red sheet.<br /><br />The rest of the play's progression reads like a Lifetime Movie. Like mother like son, son is revolted by the Phantom's appearance, but learns to look beyond it. Raoul and the Phantom have a confrontation in a seedy bar. ( This was the funniest scene in the play. I half expected Raoul to break a beer bottle in half and tell the Phantom he was gonna cut him.) Christine's fate is sealed by an errant gunshot.<br /><br />The opening number and The Beauty Underneath are wonderful. Outside of those, the music is utterly forgettable. The sets pale in comparison, magic and execution to the original. The voices of the players are all quite wonderful and appropriate. The acting is well, um, acting. The Phantom here does not have enough nuance and is far too broad. Raoul is cartoonish, but that may owe as much to the book as to the actor. Christine is portrayed ably, but just so. Gustav's sense of wonderment is a little too much, Madam G has become Norma Desmond and Meg needs lithium more than any character who's trod the boards.<br /><br />As for the other reviews on Amazon, I have to say I was totally shocked to see the number of 5 star reviews. Either ALW has a lot of relatives working the site, or there are a lot of people out there with very low standards who had a poor grasp of the original Phantom plotline and production.<br /><br />The biggest challenge after watching this poorly fleshed out affair will come when The Phantom next comes totown. When I attend a performance, I'll have to pretend the sequal never happened.

B006XF5BTG|5.0|This book was exactly what I was looking for.  I wanted a simple, no nonsense approach to fitness and health, and I wanted to get leaner, stronger, and healthier using a simple routine and diet.  There is nothing revolutionary in this book.  No miracle exercises or foods that will amaze you. Mr. Matthews just delivers practical and thorough advice.  He breaks down so many myths and common misconceptions regarding diet and exercise.<br /><br />It is by far the best 5 bucks I have spent on any health or fitness related item.  I am only a couple of weeks into my program using the Bigger, Leaner, Stronger approach, but I am already beginning  to see and feel the results. I can't say enough good things about this book.  It has become my fitness bible.  I carry it on all my mobile devices, and refer to it constantly.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for someone who is just trying to get into shape or who wants to take their workouts to another level.  You won't find a better $5 investment in your health.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved these books. It was a great escape and a great read...<br />I don't know how she can top these stories but I will be looking forward to her next novels..
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The author has created a world that is so foreign, yet becomes so familiar and believable you'll feel like you're standing beside the characters. One of the better and more interesting series I've read...ever. I was sad when it was over, I really wanted to reside there with his characters (even in the inhospitable environment) a bit more. I was very happy to see the sixth book in the series, [[ASIN:1475154771 First Shift - Legacy (Part 6 of the Silo Series)]] and bought it immediately. I was initially not happy it was a prequel, but immediately forgot that when I started reading.<br /><br />Honestly this is, without a doubt, the best value I have EVER encountered on Amazon. The price for this series is ridiculously low compared with the enjoyment you'll get out of it.<br /><br />Buy. Read. Enjoy. You won't be disappointed.

B0086700CM|5.0|this game is easy enough, you don't give up on it. but is challenging enough it focuses your attention on only the game, plus is slightly addicting.
0670023329|5.0|I read this book a few days ago and now its being passed around to friends and family.  This book stays with you, its very hard for me to realize that people are being treated this horrifically right now, this very hour on this planet, with no hope in sight. Coming to terms with this is painful while understanding Shin's difficulty in adjusting to a kinder, more caring world.  I highly recommend this book.  My worse day ever was a walk in the park compared to Shin's previous world.
B0056AFBB2|4.0|This is a perfect example of a well made simplistic case. The Removable side panels have almost no wobble at all, which you usually get in other metal cases. The 4 bay hard drive rack that can be removed is very simple. I like that the case came with a fan controller for 3 fans which fits perfectly in the vertical expansion slot. The only reason this case did not get 5 stars is that all the thumb screws were way too tight. It took the supplied allen tool with philips to loosen all the internal thumb screws. The case thumb screws I had to loosen with my own screw driver. The hard drive bays are not a tool free design, but you can remove the thumb screw that holds it into place. The side latches hold the drives very securely with out them. I am glad that I did not have to buy a 2.5 to 3.25 holder for any of the smaller drives I have installed in my computer. I would recommend this case to any one, from the novice builder to the extreme builder. This case will handle that, and every thing in between.

B003U4ZU7Q|5.0|**Spoilers of the final scene**<br />This finale was amazing. It tied up the loose ends that were the most important, and let others to the imagination. I honestly can't think a satisfactory explanation for many of the questions brought up throughout the six seasons, and no answer is better than a crappy one. As for the ending itself I've run into so many people saying, \\"I called it all along, the island was purgatory\\"...NO IT WAS NOT. The sideways flashes are purgatory, but I repeat the island and everything that happened on it was NOT. If that's what you thought about the finale then you clearly didn't understand it, and I implore you to watch season 6 again (or at least just the finale). Christian Shepard says during the finale, \\"'Yea I'm real. You're real, everything that's every happened to you is real. All those people in the church, they're all real too' and 'There is no now in this place. Some of them died before you and others long after you.'\\"<br /><br />Lost, as much as people may think otherwise, was 100% about character development. Yes at the end of each week we had new questions and were intrigued by the lore of the island, but in the end it was all about how the characters effected each others lives and how they were intertwined with each other. This was the perfect ending, and it was epitomized by what Christian Shepard says, \\"This is a place that you all made together so that you could find one another...The most important part of your life was the time that you spend with these people. That's why all of you are here. Nobody does it alone Jack. You needed all of them, and they needed you.\\"

B002RBZ13Q|5.0|One of the best if not THE best music videos I have purchased. The cinematography is incredible. The performances are superb in the Royal Albert Hall. The approach to the music video is trend setting. Camera zooming in from above, camera following the band down the hallway. The behind the scenes footage along with the camera angles and superior performance by Brandon and The Killers. I would purchase this Blu Ray again in a heartbeat. You will not be disappointed with your purchase. The opening is great. All of The Killers hits are performed.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I love this game.  right now it is the best HANDS DOWN!!!' Never knew a fruit game would be this addicting lOll
B0052VUNHC|4.0|This was a great story!  The drama was just right and this was an excellent read after the 50 Shades seris.  Not as hot, but still good.<br /><br />It was a book about two very complicated people.  We are all f'ed up an I appreciate books that deal with it.<br /><br />Remember it is fiction, and even though these things would probably not end up completely the same way in real life, who really cares?  Loose yourself in the story!<br /><br />I would heartily recommend to the author that she find a good editor.  Some of the glaring mistakes made the story harder to read.  In fact if the editing had been done I would have rated this book 5 stars.  It was that good and that hard to put down.

B004LWZW6U|2.0|Try as I might, I couldn't find a 3DD showing of this film, but did find it locally in just plain old 3D (which by the way, stinks).  The movie is a sequel to the fun Piranha 3D from 2010 which I thoroughly enjoyed.  It wasn't Oscar worthy but it was acted well, had some scary moments, plenty of over-the-toplessness and was pretty funny.  Not to be confused with filet mignon, it was still a darn good cheeseburger.<br /><br />3DD opens with grad student Maddy (Danielle Panabaker, \\"The Crazies\\") arguing with her now widowed step-father (David Koechner, who seemingly tries to play his role dramatically) about the future of their inherited water park.  Mandy, a 49% owner wants it to continue to be family friendly.  Chet (Koechner) has the great idea to make it an adult strip club located within the water park.  Chet wins the battle.<br /><br />The film is set in the progressive state of Arizona so we are easily convinced that it was no problem getting approval for families with young kids to come in the same gates as horny voyeurs.  Not to worry however as there is a fence that apparently separates the family friendly environment from full frontal nudity and pole dancing.  The 48\\" rule applies.  That's how tall you must be to see over the fence and the pre-adolescent boys take advantage.  Those boys also have an advantage over the audience however as director John Gulager only lingers a couple nano-seconds when it comes to bare skin before moving on to the next shot.  Hey, the movie's only 82 minutes.  Gotta hurry.<br /><br />But, this is a movie about deadly fish right?  This particular water park would seem to be isolated from the now abandon lake nearby where all the piranha did their dirty work.  Thanks to good old Chet who had sunk a deep water well near the park (where's that regulation Arizona?), the still viable fish eggs have their chance to hatch...and of course they do (thanks to Gary Busey).  The well gives the quick growing meat eaters direct entry to the fresh water pools.<br /><br />Piranha 3DD also teaches us a lesson about anatomy.  I didn't know that a small fish could enter a woman's naughty parts (in this case, nubile virgin Katrina Bowden), then grow a bit with nothing more than the woman having a stomach ache.  But wait.  Shelby the virgin (Bowden) decides that it must be time for her to abandon her \\"V\\" status with her boyfriend.  He of course is game but gets a climax he wasn't expecting!  I know this all sounds fun but it actually is very boring and uneven.  3DD is missing all those things its predecessor had going for it.resh water pools.<br /><br />Piranha 3DD also teaches us a lesson about anatomy.

0307951529|5.0|The $100 Startup is the latest offering from the amazing Chris Guillebeau, who runs a fun blog at The Art of Non-conformity, where he writes great manifestos, updates readers on his mission to visit every single country by the time he turns 35 (he has about 10 months to visit the last 10 countries on his list), and sells some nifty e-books to aspiring travel hackers and creative entrepreneurs.<br /><br />This book is Guillebeau's second and is a bit more polished than his first, while being equally charming. As expected from the title, the $100 Startup focuses on people who built profitable business with small amounts of startup capital, and now earn at least $50,000 a year. Guillebeau definitely did his research for this one, with detailed anecdotes from successful entrepreneurs were woven seamlessly into key points he was trying to make.<br /><br />If you have a vague idea and are looking to quit your job and start anew, but really have no idea where to start or what to consider, the book provides a very good primer. You'll have all sorts of checklists and guidelines to consider (some of which are available for free on 100startup.com), and all sorts of information you likely hadn't even considered.<br /><br />The book is a quick and fun read, and covers an incredibly wide range of topics, ranging from location independence to health insurance, from an info product launch to making decisions about everything from outsourcing to choosing between ideas for projects.<br /><br />The only place where I felt the $100 Startup fell short is that it was so heavy on success stories by successful small businesses where almost identical ideas by equally eager and skilled individuals have fallen flat. Although Guillebeau touches on areas that could lead to less-than-stellar results, and even focused on specific missteps of the successful entrepreneurs he profiled, this may not be the best book for people who make a passable living from their business but want to get to that $50,000+/year level.<br />On the plus side, Chris Guillebeau's integrity and generosity really shines through in the book. The $100 Startup is a breath of fresh air if you're used to reading ones fixated on marketing gimicks; he asks the reader to focus on how you can actually improve people's lives-not how you can convince them that you are. It is always refreshing to get business advice from someone who actually wants to help people.
B006VREOOY|4.0|I see the bad reviews and not everyone is going to like every movie but I don't understand a bad review.  One thing saving this from being a 4 star to 5 star movie for me are some inconsistancies with some of the clothing and props and the story started in 1980 then jumped one year later then there was another mention of date being 1980.  You could take the action out of this movie and you have a great story.  The action was incredible as Statham usually is and it was interesting how Deniro's character fleshed out in the end of the movie.  There is a lot of story and action crammed into a 2 hour movie with it feeling rushed at all, it felt like a much longer movie.  I highly recommend this movie for anyone that likes some spy, intrigue, action films as well as someone that likes a little historical fiction.  As for the historical ficiton the story reminds me of Charlie Wilson's War and Green Zone.
B0052VUNHC|1.0|C'mon, ladies. Let us be frank here: we are all adults and bought this \\"YA book\\" because of the hundreds of reviews, mostly positive. We're addicted to teenage romance. Damn you, Twilight Series! For our poor judgement, the gods of good fiction finally had it and punished us with Disaster. They are now surely having a good laugh at our expense, all grown women who endured this alarming atrocity till the end. Truth is we do not have the right to all this outrage. We brought this upon ourselves.<br />This book is a triumph: bad writing, horrible moral examples, a staggering (and unashamed) propaganda for the double-standard, and enough melodrama to make any Mexican soap sound like Kafka by comparison. It has it all.<br />Why isn't anyone saying the most obvious? The young people portrayed in this book are TRASH. Scene-making, over drinking, unaddressed mental problems, pit-boy girlfriend tattooed teenage wedding TRASH. Bring it on, Jersey Shore!

B004LOMB2Q|1.0|I was confused about an advertised feature, so I went to the forum to look for answers. The first post I read was aggressive, at best. It was mean, judgmental and frankly, vicious. The most aggressive responder didn't work for EverNote. She even told people to leave if they don't like it. And EverNote staff didn't do anything about her flaming.  That was enough for me. There's no way I would consider using an app that fails to stop that behavior. And there's zero chance of me supporting the app company with my hard earned dollars. Customer service is paramount, or you don't have a company.

0307472841|3.0|This book opens like gangbusters, as you can read from other reviews.  I was hooked immediately. The mysterious murders, the lack of clues, the eerie silence, the strange journal -- these all had me eagerly turning the pages. But then, the heroine, Judge Roslin, does some of the most idiotic things you can imagine.<br /><br />For instance, in China, she wanders around unaccompanied and then is surprised when something bad happens to her.  Really?  The most naive person in the world would know that going into strange neighborhoods in a country where you do not know the language is just asking for trouble.<br /><br />Even worse, once she returns home, she fears that she is targeted for assassination.  So what does she do?  Stay indoors, avoiding the windows?  Ask for police protection?  Buy a gun, a Kevlar vest, and a large dog?  No, she goes outside and sits alone in a large deserted park for hours while she ponders the details of the mystery.  I was exasperated with this ridiculous behavior and wondered why she didn't just paint a target on her back, or kill herself and save the bad guy the trouble.<br /><br />I finished the book, but was greatly dissatisfied with the last third or so.  If you really want to read this book, check it out of a library -- don't waste your money.

0307730697|4.0|Recently, I had an opportunity to read Fearless. Normally, I am not one for war stories or manly type tails but Fearless was different.<br /><br />Fearless chronicles the life of Adam Brown. It starts at the beginning of Adam's life. His caring up bring as a child, his daredevil teen years, his turn down a bad road in his early twenties and finally his  ambition to move up the ranks in the Navy, do better for his young family and become a Navy Seal. While normally, I would be turned away from this type of book. I kept pulling for Adam. I wanted him to succeed. To prove he was greater than his demons.<br /><br />Eric Blehm does an excellent job capturing Adam's personality. Reading the book made me feel as if, I actually knew Adam.  It does some have some Christian references but I don't feel that it really forces it down your throat. Mr. Blehm mentions that Adam finds God. Becomes saved and his committed to his faith. Christian or not I highly recommend this book to anybody, especially those who maybe struggling with something. Adam proves that with the right amount of determination. You can do anything. You can be amazing. You can do it all.<br /><br />I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review

B0024FAR5M|3.0|This is an ok show, a bit too much Sopranos lite biker edition without the strong lead(s). Just because a guy looks menacing doesn't mean he doesn't have to be that way.I thought the female lead was pretty good, probably the most believable part of this show.<br /><br />I like the way it depicts how mc's are in fact OC, just more adapted to the modern world than the cosa nostra is. So RICOH makes sense, I'm not sure if that's been tried against them in the real world. They have the obvious advantage of fixing/building motorcycles. It does a good job depicting how a lot of people leave their hometowns to get away from things, etc.<br /><br />I don't get the whole theme of Jacks' fathers manuscript, there are no specifics and it is never realized how it makes a difference in the plot. I'm watching season 2 and it still seems to have no relevance. The way they set it up it seemed like every episode was going to be an object lesson in Jacks' rebellion, never happened.<br /><br />Season 2 is just more of the same, I usually like shows more as they go along or they get better, it's the opposite with this show. I don't think I'll make it past season 2, like LOST, unless it gets better.<br /><br />-It's way too unrealistic depicting hardened criminals. These are not family men or honor bound people they are criminals. This whole family of outlaws is so naive and silly. Boyscouts these are not. THERE\\"S NO CODE FOR CRIMINALS PERIOD<br /><br />-Please stop the musical montages, they are so shrill and overdone. I cringe and hit fast forward.<br /><br />-It's really silly the way the Police chief goes over and above just doing business with his business partners, the Sons.<br /><br />-Neither of the 2 male lead characters are that strong or believable. Jacks is usually the smallest guy in the room and dresses like a teenager. Usually the smallest guys in that situation are the most extreme or smartest, he's neither. Clay is smug and seems like a grandpa more than anything.

B002OSY2T6|4.0|This snail toy is my baby's favorite toy since she's 3 months old..<br /><br />My baby responds well to toys that light up and emits sounds or music and that's one of the main reason why she loves this snail so much. just a gentle touch and the head of the snail lights up with varying music each time. She has not learnt to crawl yet so we lock the \\"wheel\\" of the snail so that it stays put and not crawl away.. but even if it does, it is able to \\"crawl\\" back after a certain distance.. so it is still a joy to watch the snail \\"crawl\\" back and forth.<br />this toy helped my baby in her tummy time, and helped her to roll over!! she loves this toy so much that she was trying her best to roll over so that she could get to it.<br /><br />This is the best toy for a baby's development all in all, but one flaw it has is that the \\"feelers\\" of the snail is made of hard plastic and is protuding out, many times my girl will stick the feelers into her mouth and it hit her gum and she would cry out in pain.. also i think it is a threat for baby's eyes too.. So just a word of caution for mums out there.. watch them well when they are playing with this toy..

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I bought the Hunger Games Trilogy because of all of the hoopla I was hearing about the movie \\"Hunger Games\\". The movie previews did not tell you much about the movie and it sounded like a remake of \\"The Running Man\\".  Of course the book is always better than any movie because it makes you use your own imagination.  I don't want to give away the ending so I won't. Katniss is portrayed as a very intelligent and resourceful young lady.  This clearly shows in book one and is ultimately revealed in how she changed the ending of her first Hunger Game challenge.  This book was hard to put down.<br /><br />Knowing how much she angered President Snow, she and Peeta are twice as wary when they once again enter the Hunger Game arena in the second book \\"Catching Fire\\".  During the game, Katniss and others are captured by the rebel forces, the rest are not so fortunate and are imprisoned by President Snow.  Katniss uses the fame she earned as a survivor of the Hunger Games to encourage the rebel forces to fight for their freedom.<br /><br />Book three - Mockingjay, Katniss and Peta are again united in their fight against President Snow.  This book tends to get a little slow, but has enough suspense to keep you reading to the end.  When the rebels win and Katniss is given her wish to be the one to kill President Snow there is another unexpected twist.  I thought that the series ended very well and was well worth the price and time to read it.  Thank you for a great read.

B005L38QHA|2.0|I bought this mouse mainly for the four thumb buttons. I figured it may work for mapping them to WASD for movement. The problem is, you can't map most keys on the mouse to a keystroke, so I actually had to create a macro to do a single key press for each one. It took a while to get it all working just right. I also had trouble with macros working in different games (SWTOR, GW2 beta, and Rift). Finally I gave up, and went with a Logitech G700, which so far, I'm very happy with.<br /><br />This mouse is made to mesh with World of Warcraft, even with the ability to assign key maps to the various buttons from inside the game. While I'm sure it does great at that (I don't play WoW anymore, so no first hand experience), it's just not very good for any other games.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you are buying this mouse for World of Warcraft, you'll probably be happy. If you're buying it for other games, look for something else.

1401233791|4.0|Great read, classic! Only regret is the lack of glossy pages, gotta read the next one!<br />should be apart of everyone's collection.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome so if u need a game get this one.<br />:) the first day I got it I was into it
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love this game. I just wish I could play it without an internet connection like I can read my books without. Still fun to play though.
B0015HOFZI|1.0|The built in RCA cables are short. Actually they are too short to be used in a stereo cabinet. I never did get to use the turntable, as I could not plug it up to my receiver. This item needs detachable cables. That way I could use the long ones I already own.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had heard so much about this book that I was a little nervous about reading it due to the content. The story line was wonderful. The book was mezmorizing and well worth reading. I cannot wait to read the next one....

0307716546|4.0|I really liked this. I don't love scary books but I love suspense. The \\"scary\\" part was the beginning...the interesting thing was seeing life as not a player but as an observer and realizing things aren't always what they seem.
B0086700CM|5.0|at first when I got my kindle fire I was frantically looking for this game. I love it. but they should really get their games uploaded to the store faster.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I read all three books in a very short time frame and can not wait for the movies to come out for books two and three.  Love the series!  But of the three books - this is my least favorite.<br /><br />I won't spoil it for anyone... but I do have to say I did get a little annoyed with how the author would sometimes jump ahead and skip a whole event by having a character \\"black out\\" only to have the information filled in by a brief re-account from another character.  Seemed like a lazy way to get through the story.<br /><br />And I wonder if by book three if the author wasn't just trying to close up some loose ends anyway... because the ending really, really seemed a bit... weak.<br /><br />But if you have been reading the series you do have to read the final book to have closure...  Otherwise - you never know what happens.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I wasn't going to read the rest of the series after reading book 1 the Hunger Games, my Daughter in law talked me into it. I am so glad that she did. I found book 1 very predictable with no surprises,not so with book 2 every page turn brought a new and unexpected twist.The very day I finished Catching Fire I had to purchase book 3 I was totally hooked and had to know what happened next.
B003O86FMW|1.0|I'm reviewing book two and three the same way because neither were very impressive. Stop at Hunger Games. These books won't make you feel any better about the characters or the world as a whole. Katniss has severely changed and it isn't for the better. Remember her as she was in Hunger Games. You will be disappointed.
0345803485|5.0|These books were a great read!! Fell in love with Christian Grey!! :) Once I started reading I could not put it down!
B0086700CM|5.0|Glad I got a chance to play this game on my kindle fire very fun. Have game on ipod as well.

B0063IH60K|5.0|I've always been a fan of solitaire for years, and I'm still a fan now... This Kindle fire version is real good.. besides the dumb pop-ups before the game, I have no other complaints about the app :)
B0086700CM|5.0|was waiting 4 it for kindle fire and it was SOOOOOOOOO worth the wait!!! love it solo much everyone should get it!<br />my high score is 2.2 million ;)
B007V2UGPE|5.0|so much fun omg!! but they totally want you to purchase coins which gets kinda old... but other than that its great!
B005HYNCTK|5.0|Although I know little about Bruckner and Celibidache, I think it is utterly fair commentary to say that Celibidache completely opened up the God-music of Bruckner.<br /><br />I said I don't know much about Bruckner, but he has been a constant musical companion throughout my life.  Only lately have I been realizing just how overwhelming his bond with the Christian God was, and that he constantly tried to capture in music the experience of being rapt into the world of God.<br /><br />Celibidache was a man whose philosophy was Zen Buddhism, but what a match these two titans made!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I purchased all three books - Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed.  All three books were Excellent!  I loved the story line and in fact I made a comment that this will be my all time favorite love story!  Very well written.  I would, however, be caution to the age group of this series, as there is alot of sexual content in the books.
B0086700CM|5.0|its finally on the kindle fire<br />I'm so excited about this :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D
B0086700CM|5.0|Love it! The quality is excellent and it is very responsive! Just like playing on the ipad! I really enjoy this version.
B0053O8ARI|5.0|I hope there are great extra features on the discs, but this show will certainly sell without them.<br />From episode 1 they had me. I absolutely love Kat Dennings and scene-stealer Jonathan Kite as Oleg. The whole cast is strong, and it's refreshing to find a sitcom so funny and well-written in these days of reality tv.<br />My only question is when is the release date for these discs? Please include that bit of info on the merchandise page, please, Amazon.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|it just tells me that its loading and wont let me on... same with my friends playing. on other devices... love the game.. wish it would work right!!
B007V5CF5K|5.0|I really enjoyed this game that I didn't want to stop playing it. It was not too hard but still challenging enough to be fun. I purchased both Snark Busters and I hope there is a third. Thanks!
B0086700CM|4.0|this game is fantastic and addictive. But there are a few gitchs in this game but still once you start playing this game you can't stop.
B0071MV540|3.0|If you can shut your brain down for a while, this is an entertaining movie. However, you really can't begin to think much at all because of the huge plot holes throughout. It is barely worth a rental and certainly not a buy. If you have a little time to kill and try not to think too hard, it can be enjoyable. They just could have done so much more with the plot and especially the cast.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|It was a wonderful experience to see the vocal power of Adele and great to hear the stories about her own songs. Great music, and a very cute show. I would only say, I did not like the production. The video direction was bland and lacking of interest. The video on the DVD is not even HD, so that I did not like either. But if you like Adele, you will get tons of her with this DVD.
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm not surprised that this is like one of the most wanted app by all my friends. Its so addictive ; you cant put it down once you've started. Its like an adrenalin rush that just wont stop and its free(and probably the best free game you'll ever get)!
B00881VLCE|4.0|I read some negative reviews for this app regarding the Fire. I tried several puzzles to see if it would give me problems. I found the controls to be fairly smooth. At first there was an issue or two moving the pieces but when I tried being easy and just flicked them onto the workspace each piece moved without issue. I completed multiple puzzles without any trouble. I downloaded a free puzzle pack and they worked well also. There seemed to be a good number of free puzzle packs available. My only issue is that the pieces don't rotate making the puzzles a bit easier than they could be. Real puzzles require a bit more mental work. But then again it is on a tablet. You could always go to a store and buy a real puzzle if you want something more challenging. All in all I find this a fun time waster.
B005LAIHSG|3.0|In \\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\", first-time director Rupert Sanders offers a new, less than successful interpretation of the Brothers Grimm's timeless fairy tale. There are some things I enjoyed in the movie. The scenery in Pembrokshire and Marloes Sands, Wales, is lonely, rugged and spectacular. Much of the film takes place in a frightening place called the Dark Forest replete with snakes, gnarled trees, out of the way paths and strange creatures. It is a good setting in its own right as the huntsman leads Snow White through its treacherous maze. And the movie offers long scenes of crystalline yet forbidding lakes.<br /><br />Kristen Stewart stars as the heroine while Charlize Theron overacts as the extrarordinarily wicked Queen Ravenna. In this version of the story, Snow White has two suitors: Eric,portrayed by Chris Hemsworth, a rugged huntsman grieving over the death of his wife, and the aristocrat William, Snow White's childhood friend, played by Sam Claffin, who is in rebellion against the wicked, usurping queen. The acting is acceptable if sometimes stilted. The dialogue frequently is commonplace.<br /><br />The movie changes the usual telling by deemphasizing love and romance and making Snow White a active independent person in her own right. In the traditional tale, Snow White sleeps and much of the action focuses on the eccentric, affectionate Seven Dwarfs.  In this story the Dwarfs are eccentric indeed but they are a mean group, won over to the princess with difficulty.  There is an apple and an awakening kiss but little is made of it. Instead, Snow White becomes a Joan of Arc figure and leads an attack, shown in great detail, on Queen Ravenna and her well-fortified and defended castle. Love and romance get downplayed, as Snow White becomes an independent, strong willed, benevolent, and self-sufficient ruler without a man at her side.<br /><br />Plotting and pacing are major issues with \\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\". At over two hours in length the movie drags.  There are too many characters and special effects which, while frequently interesting in themselves, take away from the story. The story line is unduly tangled and difficult to follow with its many distractions. Romance is pushed aside in a way that does not improve or modernize the old tale.  There are magic mirrors, attack birds, shards of glass, strange creatures, lots of violence and a coming of age for the heroine. But the movie is gimmicky and lacks cohesion, timing, and tension.<br /><br />There are some interesting things in this movie, but it fails to enhance its classic story.<br /><br />Total Time: 126 minutes<br /><br />Robin Friedmandrags.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|After reading so many reviews on this book both good and bad, I finally caved in and purchased it. It was easy to read, entertaining, and overall a good buy.  I recommended the books to several friends and they too are hooked. After reading so many comments on women who would never read this book because of its contents made me laugh at how immature some women can be.  It's fictional, and just a book, pick it up or don't. I particularly didn't care to read how they felt this book was a sin which is why I chose to read it for myself and decide if I liked it or not. I did =)
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Very satisfied with the Samsung Infuse G4 Smartphones I purchased through Amazon. My only complaint stems from the AT&T side. A visit to a local AT&T store for assistance in correcting some of the pre-loaded info in the phone resulted in not only loosing all my contacts, but the ability to use my old cell phone at all, even though it was not terminated. There seems to be some animosity about purchasing products other than at the box store. No complaints at all about Amazon service, same as always, very satisfactory. Love the Samsung Infuse, it's an awesome phone, terrific deal from Amazon

044042321X|3.0|This graphic novel was read after meeting George R R Martin at the 50th Anniversary of Comics Fandom special party at the Comic-Con International: San Diego of 2011.<br /><br />So what is the publisher's promo blurb for this trade paperback compilation (graphic novel)? Here it is:<br /><br />\\"You've read the books. You've watched the hit series on HBO. Now acclaimed novelist Daniel Abraham and illustrator Tommy Patterson bring George R. R. Martin's epic fantasy masterwork A Game of Thrones to majestic new life in the pages of this full-color graphic novel. Comprised of the initial six issues of the graphic series, this is the first volume in what is sure to be one of the most coveted collaborations of the year.<br /><br />Winter is coming. Such is the stern motto of House Stark, the northernmost of the fiefdoms that owe allegiance to King Robert Baratheon in far-off King's Landing. There Eddard Stark of Winterfell rules in Robert's name. There his family dwells in peace and comfort: his proud wife, Catelyn; his sons Robb, Brandon, and Rickon; his daughters Sansa and Arya; and his bastard son, Jon Snow. Far to the north, behind the towering Wall, lie savage Wildings and worse--unnatural things relegated to myth during the centuries-long summer, but proving all too real and all too deadly in the turning of the season.\\"<br /><br />Okay... Here's My Take on this issue:<br /><br />First of all, as stated above... I met George at the party, but had not read the books he had written, nor seen the HBO series on TV.<br /><br />So this book was my first introduction to 'A Game of Thrones'.<br /><br />The storyline was pretty well written, except that it was a little 'choppy' in the comic book version of the books.  Too many characters for this format, and it took me a while to settle in to read the whole book.<br /><br />The artwork was pretty good, and carried my interest in the series until I was up to speed on the series.  There was some confusion on my part as to who was whom, but I'm not for sure if that was the artist's doing or my own fault.<br /><br />The lettering and coloring was done well, and the whole production was very fine.<br /><br />Not a bad start for this series of books, of which the 2nd volume is scheduled for December of 2012 release!<br /><br />My comic book grade for this first issue is a Very Fine / Very Fine Plus (VF/VF+) 8.25 out of a possible 10.0 comic book grading scale.whom, but I'm not for sure if that was the artist's doing or my own fault.<br /><br />The lettering and coloring was done well, and the whole production was very fine.<br /><br />Not a bad start for this series of books, of which the 2nd volume is scheduled for December of 2012 release!<br /><br />My comic book grade for this first issue is a Very Fine / Very Fine Plus (VF/VF+) 8.25 out of a possible 10.0 comic book grading scale.
B0042P2VLU|5.0|I like the animation and the extention of the story before the music begins. As a music teacher, I actually like the fact that there is no naration in this version. I think it allows the solo instruments to be fully heard. For very young childen I'd stick with the standard Disney or other cartoon versions, but if you are looking for something more sophisticated, this is a well done option.
B0086700CM|5.0|so glad that this finally came to kindle fire! I love it! it's definitely one of the most addicting games I've played as well!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This game is very fun. Good timing for food and a great game; it is worth it. add me JJLEHO99@
B007SGM084|4.0|The books are pretty good but I don't like how the Kindle bundle is set up. It comes together and once you open the book from your home screen you can choose which book you want to read. This was annoying at times but I did like the fact that all 3 books were purchased at once. I wish there was a price incentive for buying all 3 at once. Enjoy
B0086700CM|5.0|I haven't been able to find anything wrong with it so far,and I've had it for quite about 3 weeks.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Great job on making a game that helps me waste more of my time. I was running out of levels on Cut the Rope. This is better than sudoku.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great for any age. cute animals and fun setting for a animal village. I love it.  wish I would have found it sooner.

B001U7FWM8|5.0|Grizzly Bear are set to release their fourth studio album later this year and even in this era where new music is constantly in circulation (quite often before it's actual release date) i'd be suprised if it's not being eagerly awaited by even the most highly saturated of music listeners. The reason i assert this is almost entirely based on the glowing reviews this album received upon it's 2009 release, attracting a mass of new fans and turning the band into one of indie rocks hottest properties. So three years on, having personally been re-introduced to Grizzly Bear by listening to Daniel Roseens excellent Silent Hour/Golden mile EP a couple of months ago, i thought i'd give my thoughts on this beaut of an album.<br /><br />\\"Southern Point\\" opens the record with an intriguiging flutter, it rises with a cascade of instrumentation that's played with equals parts intensity and poise. \\"Two Weeks\\" the albums most successful single follows and even with it's endless appearance on TV and Radio it's not lost an iota of magic. I'm not one for hyperbole but i think it's one of greatest pop songs of the century! the simplicity of the staccato piano chords, the syncopated drumming and the stunning singing of Ed Droste with the sumptuous vocal harmonies (featuring Victoria Legrand of Beach House) makes the song feel utterly transcendent.<br /><br />Nico Muhly the clasical protege makes a welcome addition here too, providing some delightful choral arrangements to \\"Cheerleader\\" and \\"Foreground\\" two of the songs that captured peoples attention when the album unfotunately leaked prior to it's release date. \\"Cheerleader\\" is a seductive wonder and is one of the most accesible tracks here too, even if it still features the wide open spaces the rest of the songs have on this album. \\"Foreground\\" is awe inspiringly gorgeous, showing an obvious Radiohead influence with it's sombre melody, which isn't suprising considering they opened for them around the making of this album in 2008.<br /><br />\\"Fine For Now\\", \\"While You Wait For The Others\\" and \\"I Live With You\\" show the band at their most visceral. Each have powerfully cathartic moments, whether it's the post rock hurricane of guitars in \\"Fine For Now\\" or the completely unexpected synthesizer explosions in \\"I Live with you\\" or how about the sheer stomping force of the vocal harmonies of \\"WYWFTO\\". They provide the album with real bite and counter balance the more elegantly subtle yet somewhat meandering songs like \\"Hold Still\\" and \\"Ready, Able\\" the latter sounding almost disturbingly carnivalesque.<br /><br />I wouldn't expect listeners to fall in love with this album on first listen it's layered, nuanced, arrangements don't immediately jump out at you but once they ingratiate themselves into your mind they're unlikely to ever leave there again. Atleast it's been that way for me anyway I love this record and i can't wait to hear what they come up with for the next album thats hopefully just around the corner from being released. If it's able to continue the brilliance of what began on \\"Yellow House\\" and matured on \\"Veckatimest\\" it's easily going to be frontrunner for best of the year.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love my games with a good challenge. I have a Kindle Fire so the game has great graphics and is easy to control. I love the fact that its free haha.
B000UVLK1M|5.0|This is a beautiful album.  Even though it was made in 2007, I love it more everytime I listen.  Joni Mitchell is an icon and those of us who are of a \\"certain generation\\" strongly identify with her music.  Herbie Hancock has captured the essence of who she is in his interpretations of her songs.  I love the vocalists he selected and that he included Joni Mitchell herself.  He is a master composer at these types of creative arrangements, remixing each song with his type of cool jazz. My favorite is the last song - The Jungle Line with Leonard Cohen and his haunting voice. If you love Hancock and appreciate his music, this CD is a must have.
0345803485|5.0|It was hard to put any of the books down. If you haven't already, order books 2 & 3.  Was a little sad that it was ending when I finished book three.  Hope she writes more books!
B007N0REX6|5.0|I'm surprised at how many negative reviews there are here...they are more than welcome, of course, since everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion, but this album sounds so killer that I was sure it would receive more universal acclaim. Well, to me it's an absolute stunner! \\"All killer, no filler\\"...that phrase can be applied to this album more than any new album I've bought in some time! While offering some variety in musical styles here...songs with a touch of punk, some with a touch of melodic pop metal...ALL with a basis in good ol' hard rock...this album is a musically cohesive and well produced body of work, and I daresay is Slash's best effort since GNR's Appetite for Destruction!! The songs here sound fresh and new without ripping off other songs, yet retain that hard rock edge of GNR. Slash dishes out plenty of incendiary solos, and Myles Kennedy has REALLY come into his own as Slash's vocalist! What a range that guy has...I am NOT missing Axl at all here! Some say Slash just isn't Slash without Axl, but Myles is his own man, and fits into Slash's music as well as Axl did, IMO. I really liked Slash's last CD, and while having all the guest vocalists on that one was an interesting move, I thought the cohesiveness suffered a bit as a result. Needless to say, for me Apocalyptic Love is a little better than his last album, and that's saying something!<br /><br />And not just because it's more cohesive, it's the songs themselves! The songs on this CD are so good, I thought, \\"OK, what outside writers did Slash utilize for his material here?\\" I looked on the CD notes, and nope, NONE...all written by Slash and Myles, with the partial exception of one tune contributed to by the producer Eric Valentine, who btw did a GREAT job of producing and mixing this album! Amazing...Slash and Myles just knocked it out of the park here!!<br /><br />I know I sound like a fan boy here, but I have listened to this CD multiple times to make sure it really is as good as I thought it was after the first listen--lol. As far as I'm concerned, this is the album that picks up where Appetite left off! Anyone who thinks Slash's creative juices dried up long ago is sorely mistaken! INDISPENSABLE for all Slash, Velvet Revolver, and GNR fans!!!
B005URRCUY|5.0|This is an excellent CD! All the tracks are great especially Track #1-Lonely Boy and #2-Gold on the ceiling1 I also like the old time R&R approach to the music but,with The Black Keys own stamp! Thumbs up to the Black Keys!!

B004LROMQG|5.0|I think NBC missed a chance at a great show in its line up when it decided not to renew Merlin! I love this show and am so glad I can at least get it on DVD thanks to the BBC. It has action, romance, and magic. I love the characters and the point of view from the beginning of the relationship between Merlin and Arthur.
B007V5CF5K|1.0|that is the only thing I can ask for... will NOT download .Have BEEN TRYING FOR DAYS... ITS REDICULOUS<br />..
0143119680|1.0|The characters are one sided and the main characters are too perfect.<br /><br />The story is completely undeveloped and the writer relies that the reader will purchase book 2 to resolve issues brought up in book one.  Book one is in desperate need of a competent EDITOR.  So much should have been deleted.  This was just plain tedious and boring.  I'm downright irritated that I was \\"tricked\\" into reading it based on the good reviews.<br /><br />Wasted money and Wasted time.<br />Save yours!

B0085157B8|3.0|Piranha 3DD is the sequel to 2010's Piranha 3D, which was a remake of 70's Roger Corman classic. I was looking forward to this movie since I liked the goretastic Piranha 3D. However, after watching this I have no idea why it was made. Sure it's okay, but okay isn't good enough. Piranha 3D was a monster movie that was like a masterpiece compared to a Syfy original movie. However, Piranha 3DD really isn't any better than a lot of those Syfy original movies. I swear, it isn't much better than Mega Piranha and Dinocroc. There doesn't seem to be near as much gore as in Piranha 3D, which was that movie's selling point. This ones selling points seems to be boobs, but you can see those anywhere. I really wanted a lot of gore and action, and it just didn't happen much. And David Hasselhoff appears as himself, and it's pretty lame. Also, the movie is only 72 minutes not counting closing credits. The closing credits contain bloopers. So after all the bashing, you might be wondering why I'm giving Piranha 3DD 3 stars out of 5. Well, it was pretty entertaining. I mean, I was never too bored. And it's mercifully short. But I highly doubt there will be a Piranha 3DDD.

B005LAIGWS|1.0|Just when I thought that the Green Lantern movie was the worst Comic Book Adaptation ever......along comes Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance. Now I'll be the first to admit that I'm not well versed in the Ghost Rider mythos, but I do know a good movie when I see one and Spirit of Vengeance is NOT a good movie.....at all. The first 5-10 minutes of the movie started out strong and then did a 180 and went downhill fast. Bad acting, bad writing.....pretty much bad everything. The special effects for Ghost Rider were decent, but that's about it. I was really looking forward to this movie and I was let down by how bad it was. Seriously, don't waste your money. Wait for it to hit STARZ or HBO if you really want to see it. There's always Redbox, but I wouldn't waste the $1.20.
B003BW0CB6|3.0|I've read the first 2 so far and loved them both. This was by far my least favorite. Not much suspence and moves a lot slower.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|This book was a guilty pleasure. I kept thinking I was breaching someone's privacy, which is a testament to well-drawn characters and a great storyline. Much has been said in reviews about the characters and their behavior, enough to spoil the entire experience of the book if you read them all. I am one who prefers to come to my own conclusions but these reviews have been as compelling as the book itself, which says a lot about the author's ability to draw a reader in, for better or worse.<br /><br />The same thing happened with Twilight (and Twilight fans are much maligned in some Beautiful Disaster reviews). I almost didn't read the Twilight series because of other peoples' judgements. When I finally did read it, I had some gut reactions that matched other criticisms, and yet did not feel it needed to be changed to meet my political standards. I LIKE a book that makes my gut react! For me, if a character is reacting to circumstances and plot twists in fairly consistent ways, which match their background and context AND the storyline is interesting, I suspend my politics for the sake of entertainment. (Arrest me for believing in freedom of artistic expression but please make sure I have a lot of books like this in the prison library!) Abby is presented in some of these reviews as a victim, however she reminded me frequently of Katherine in Taming of the Shrew (who, similarily to Abby, is initially courted via a bet and won over through a what could be viewed as a rape.)<br /><br />By the way, other than the dicey moments of consent vs nonconsent (where games are played on both sides), the sex is not that adult graphic and could have been more detailed for my taste. Travis does not come across as a great lover and I want him to be but then again, why would he be? It is more consistent with his character to be pleasure oriented and Abby comes to him as a virgin, not knowing she can expect more.<br /><br />I also would have appreciated more detailed physical descriptions of the main characters. I know Abby has caramel hair, Travis has 6-pack abs and tattoos and America has blonde hair but their faces and body language remained a blur.<br /><br />I found Abby's failure to return the Tennis bracelet to another love interest, whom she spurned, to be consistent with her self-absorbed character but incredibly anxiety producing. I wanted to shake Abby and tell her to give the shiny bracelet back! I had a hard time believing that her love interest would not object; although at that age, people can be very idealistic about no-strings love and regret such a thing only years later. (I am well past \\"that age\\" and have many regrets of my own.)<br /><br />The Vegas sequences could have been more detailed and stretched out, and the build up toward first sex could have been less so. I suspect that if this book becomes a movie, which is highly likely due to its popularity and larger-than-life characters, a lot of the pacing problems will be smoothed out. I would love to see this story unfold in 3-D.ons of the main characters.

B004J4WLB4|5.0|I found this to be a delightful read.<br />The characters are well developed, and the plot is intriguing.  I enjoyed the author's descriptions of place and circumstance.<br />Interspersed throughout the novel, as the title suggests, are uses of the old Victorian meanings of various flowering and non-flowering plants.  I have always been fascinated by this means of communication, so this was particularly enjoyable to read in a fictional work.<br />I will recommend this book to my friends, and will read it again in the future.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I REALLY like this game...tons of levels varying in difficulty from simple to quite difficult. Highly recommended if you like puzzle games!
