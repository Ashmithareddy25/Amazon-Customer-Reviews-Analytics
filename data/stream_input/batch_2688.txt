B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This is a great game.  It is not hard to get up to speed on how to use it, there is a great tutorial at the beginning, and it's engaging.  My only issue is it takes up a bit of storage/RAM/Disk space.  Not a negative, but an observation.

B001L83PLQ|5.0|I have been spending part of my summer reading Adichie books, and Half a Yellow Sun is one of them.  Why I am reading Adichie?  Because I like her writing style, I enjoy the stories she tells, and I think it is fascinating to read about a country from the perspective of a native of that country.  Surely anyone can write about Nigeria, but having a Nigerian writer do so seems to add even more credibility.<br />I enjoyed Half of a Yellow Sun because it talks about the Biafrian war from the insider perspective.  Adichie had me feeling I was actually there as the war unfolded facing the difficult choices people in war torn countries must make.  First, Adichie lets us know what life is like for academics living in a college town.  There are days and nights of endless academic discussions, in homes with ‘help’ in the form on house boys from the bush with menus that are almost improbable.  This life style is contrasted with Nigeria’s wealthy ‘Big Men’ and their families who have almost everything they desire: money, homes, food, the luxuries of travel; really all that money can bring. Will they stay in Nigeria, or will they flee the county until the unrest is over?<br /> More than about War, Half of a Yellow Sun is about people, and the choices they make or are forced to make.  Standing up for your principles is not always easy and Half  Yellow Sun brings this concept firmly into focus.<br />Hal of a Yellow Sun is not easy beach reading.  Rather it is food for the mind and soul.  It is an exploration of values and an exploration of what true nationalism is about from several perspectives.  I highly recommend it.<br />When you finish reading, you will be enlightened.  You will walk away with a great understanding of Nigeria, their civil war and the people who populate this fascinating country.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Game is just like Templeton except with minions. To be honest this game is so much better. Highly recommend it and if you don't like it something's wrong.

B00000F14B|5.0|This wonderfully engaging film offers a double shot of nostalgia, first for its setting in 1912 \\"River City,\\" Iowa (a genial caricature of Mason City, the composer's home town); and second for the production itself, now more than 50 years out of the gate and still going strong.  The film is a knockout, crammed to the rafters with wonderful actors--Robert Preston, who was born to portray Professor Harold Hill; Shirley Jones, ever the radiant ingenue; and a host of irreplaceable character actors--Paul Ford, Hermione Gingold, Pert Kelton, Mary Wickes,and Buddy Hackett among them.  You'll even see an eight-year-old Ron Howard in his pre-Opie days, lending a certain poignancy to the story.  \\"The Music Man\\" concerns \\"Professor\\" Harold Hill, a slick charlatan who falls unexpectedly for Marian, the strait-laced but ultimately enchanting town librarian.  Along the way Composer/Author Willson pokes affectionate fun at the Iowans of his boyhood, and also offers some wickedly clever numbers--notably a rap-like opener--and such lovely standards as \\"Goodnight, My Someone\\" and \\"Till There Was You.\\"  There's also a terrific dance number, \\"Shipoopi,\\" which, though it  adds nothing to the story, is nevertheless an eye-popping delight.  The number took several weeks to film, and parts of it were shot from a height of 76 feet above the sound stage (in sly tribute to the trombones of the movie's grand finale).  I suspect that even the cynics who profess to hate musicals will fall for this one just as I did when, as a 17-year-old, I saw \\"The Music Man\\" in its first run.  It bowled me over then, and it does so every time I watch it.  I bet it'll do the same for you.
B00DW2PDH8|5.0|An elegant, terrifying, seductive story is brought to life by the highly skillful pen of Simon O'Kill. From the stunning beginning to the shocking end, it is impossible to put the book down. Sometimes you want to stop reading, you want to escape from the relentless horror of the situations described, but you soon return because you simply have to know what happens next.<br /><br />Luna Sanguis is hard to categorize. It is, of course, a vampire story, but it transcends the usual genre by its delicate psychological drama. The secondary personalities of the protagonists, the amnesia, the merging of time, space, dream and reality, are profoundly complex. However, there is no need to keep track of what is real and what is imaginary - it does not matter - and the way to get the most from the book is to let go and allow the dark waves carry you to the conclusion. The quest for eternal life, such as it is for a vampire, is not limited by the here and now, and the leaps across several time periods, back and forth, emphasize this obsession so closely tied with blood, sexuality, and existence.<br /><br />Be warned; this book is not for the faint of heart. Expect to be gasping with surprise and shock at several of the brutal, cruel, distressing scenes of blood, torture, sex, and extreme violence. And yet, the language is poetic and polished, even when the subject matter is highly disturbing - or perhaps particularly at these moments. Above all, try not to read it before you go to sleep; nightmares are guaranteed. I highly recommend this book to the discerning reader, but please read it when the sun is shining, not the moon...
B001MW0J2Y|5.0|This is a gem of an album, and an example of a mature artist making something wholly his own, unaffected by popular demands. Most of John's lyrics are of a fairly spiritual nature here, as he muses on the nature of God, suffering, life, and death. Both dark and uplifting, there's no shortage of shiver-producing moments on this album. Currently, my favorite thing from John.
B00BS3EMNY|5.0|Discovered Caro Emerald recently on an episode of &#34;Later with Jools Holland&#34;. Her performance of &#34;Liquid Lunch&#34; and &#34;Completely&#34; were enough incentive for me to order this CD, even as a slightly pricey import. Her voice is amazing and her style is fresh and fun. Aside from the previously mentioned songs, my favorites on this CD are &#34;Tangled Up&#34;, &#34;The Maestro&#34; and &#34;My Two Cents&#34;. If you enjoy Big Band and swing music and are looking for something new and different, this is well worth purchasing. You won't be disappointed.

B00BEZTMWW|3.0|I bought this mainly to show off the 3D effects of my new 3D Samsung TV.  Since it was shot fully with very high resolution HD 3D cameras, I expected it to be great.

It just wasn't as amazing as the original Lord of the Rings trilogy, sorry to say

B004GHNIRK|3.0|This book was written several, several years ago and is very difficult to read.  It is interwoven with words that are not in my vocabulary and are not modern words, especially in their usage.  Luckily I have a Kindle which allows me to look up definitions as I go.  The reading is very slow.  I have been reading an hour or so at night for 2 months or more and am only 11% finished with the book.  However, it is beginning to become interesting so maybe the reading will go faster now!!!  It became tiresome a couple of weeks ago though, so I put it down for a week while I read a 'modern' drama.

B00BVMXBVG|5.0|I've seen a lot of Sci Fis where half the energy goes into effects and so matter how cool it looks the show still sucks.  This show has next to no special effects but is my favorite Sci Fi on TV right now.  It has an amazing script and a cast that can do it justice.  No one is super famous as far as I know save Matt Frewer who is not super famous but a badass.  Anyway it's a great Sci Fi with a tight scripts executed really really really well and I won't spoil it but if you liked x files before it went to hell you will like this..

B007G51UV0|5.0|Pros: After reading reviews of this board for a while I had some doubts about it. But then I realized every board in every brand I checked out had some of the same issues: DOA, slots not working, etc. Two major concerns for me were DOA (I ended up buying it while out of state) and RAM not working (almost everything on the Asus QVL is discontinued). I may be daft, but I finally figured out it is easier to go to the RAM manufacturer's site and check for compatibility.<br /><br />I'm definitely glad I chose this board. I've had zero issues.<br /><br />The AI Suite is...um...sweet. :)<br />It gives you a lot of control from within Windows instead of having to reboot and work in the BIOS. You can monitor and control clock speeds, fans, power, RAM, temps, just about everything except the wife.<br /><br />My BIOS didn't need any flashing.<br /><br />My RAM was instantly recognized and set at proper values (1600, not default to 1333). I ran Memtest for each stick and on each slot. No probs.<br /><br />More USB 3.0 available than I currently need.<br /><br />The layout is nice. No probs getting RAM in with stock cooler. The right angle SATA ports aren't an issue for me either. Yes, they are a little awkward, but not troublesome.<br /><br />Expandable to 32GB RAM<br /><br />Wifi... many thanks to all the reviewers who mentioned installing it BEFORE putting the board in the case.<br /><br />Cons: The LED lights are nice for indicators, but I wish this board showed post codes like my old AB9-Pro.<br /><br />This BIOS is set to AHCI mode by default. Since I reused a hard drive that was set to IDE mode, it wouldn't boot at first. I found the solution online and fixed it... then I noticed the slip of paper Asus included in the box warning me of that issue and explaining how to fix it (oops).<br /><br />Video card renders neighboring slots unusable. I guess this is the case for every manufacturer now that cards are thicker, but you'd think someone would start figuring out how to accomodate that issue.<br /><br />I have my computer hardwired, so wifi really isn't an issue, but I expected if I disconnected the ethernet cable (or it failed for some reason) the wifi would automatically kick in. This isn't the case. No biggie.<br /><br />Other Thoughts: I bought one of these a few weeks ago from a chain store while in another state because NewEgg raised the price on the day I was going to order it & it ended up being cheaper to pay taxes and all. Bad Newegg. :p<br /><br />i7-3770k with stock cooler<br />P8Z77-V Pro<br />Patriot Viper 3 DDR3-1600 16GB (2x8GB)<br />PNY GTX 560ti (yep, need a new card, but BF3 still looks and runs great)<br />WD Black 1TB 7200rpm<br />Mushkin Enhanced 800W power supplycomodate that issue.<br /><br />I have my computer hardwired, so wifi really isn't an issue, but I expected if I disconnected the ethernet cable (or it failed for some reason) the wifi would automatically kick in.

Saying that, I found them completely different but was very pleased with the movie anyway.Super exciting and entertaining. I'm definitely looking forward to adding it to my blu-ray collection. Aside from that I love Brad Pitt and have liked Mireille Enos since season one of The Killing. Love that show!

B00CH26TL8|1.0|Barely got started when the game started asking for money. I did read when I bought it that it would be asking for money but didn't expect it so soon. And was very annoyed that it keeps asking me to \\"like\\" it on face book and then it did inform me that if I liked it it would then annoy everyone in my face book. So no......a fun game but so very annoying and pushy and I won't be playing it anymore b/c it won't let me unless I give it MORE money and allow it to annoy everyone in my face book......geesh. A waste of money. I'm even angry over it....

0425263924|3.0|Third in the Crossfire erotic romance series revolving around Gideon Cross and Eva Tramell.<br /><br />My Take<br />Okay, compared to the previous two books, this merits a \\"4\\", however, compared to most books, it drops to a \\"3\\". Why you may ask? Well, it is my favorite of the three in this series (so far): Eva isn't going for the gold in Whining nor is she being as dumb a twit as in the previous two stories. I also like the psychological exploration that's happening in this. Yes, the interaction is tamer and with less of the BDSM than the previous two as well, mostly because Day has toned down some of the excessive melodrama, thank you, God. It's not to say there isn't any conflict, however. Eva still has her past and present problems while Gideon has his own nightmares. And I am just so grateful to be free of the mass blocks of whining!<br /><br />Eva keeps almost dropping into stupidhood, but then she recovers, most of the time. At times, it's Gideon's turn to push back at her, to force her to continue what she starts. She also looks back at past events and realizes that her original interpretation was so wrong. The story is a great example of how couples could (or should) be talking to each other.<br /><br />The trauma and nightmares that Gideon suffers makes him an Everyman. However successful, however gorgeous, the man is suffering, and yet he continues to work and live his life.<br /><br />I love the lengths to which Gideon goes to try and make Eva comfortable.<br /><br />Nice bit of insight from Eva about Gideon's torment: \\"You didn't enjoy it. You felt pleasure and that's not the same thing.\\" It goes with so many of the rape-type romances in which the man forces a reaction from the woman's body, but her mind keep saying no.<br /><br />Naturally, there has to be conflict, and Gideon pushes Eva about coming to work for him. A natural no-go for Eva, a woman who wants to make it on her own merit and have no one dispute her skill or ability. There's also the question of Nathan's murder and Gideon's culpability that hangs over the couple.<br /><br />Okay, if Cary's normal reaction is to be affectionate when he's pulling away and wanting to distance himself, why would Eva interpret Cary being openly affectionate with Trey as wanting to pull him closer? I mean, it's what I'd like to see happen, but Eva has too much history with Cary and his reactions to actually believe this.<br /><br />Oh, brother, I see it as a misstep, that scene on the plane where Eva pushes too hard. And the whole scene feels manufactured by Day as she struggled to get one last major conflict in, although I did like the prenup.<br /><br />Oh, wow, I feel so sorry for Jean-François. To be hit over the head like this.<br /><br />I can see why Day needs to take this further than a trilogy. It's like they say in writing school, ya gotta listen to the characters and just follow the story where it goes. And it is a reasonable continuance. Sure, the idea probably occurred to Day, and she took a look at the book sales and thought oh, mama, how can I resist stretching this trilogy for a couple more books, and why not?<br /><br />The Story<br />After events in [[ASIN:0425263916 Reflected in You (Crossfire, #2)]], Eva must stay away from Gideon. It's essential to his freedom and her happiness. Her eventual happiness anyway.<br /><br />As far as the public knows, Gideon used Eva to make his former mistress jealous. A necessary deception if Gideon is to stay out of jail. There are, however, unfortunate side effects, namely friends encouraging her to find a rebound guy. And Brett insisting she be his date for Golden's debut. A video with too many repercusions.<br /><br />Then everything truly falls apart when Eva's dad finds out about Nathan, with her dad about to fall even further.<br /><br />The Characters<br />An advertising assistant at Waters Field & Leaman, Eva Tramell works in the Crossfire Building within arm's reach of Gideon Cross, an incredibly gorgeous billionaire running Cross Industries with his own traumas to cope with. He's also obsessed with Eva, her safety, her existence, her loving him back. Angus McLeod is Gideon's driver and a witness. Ireland is Gideon's half-sister, and she worships him.<br /><br />Cary Taylor is Eva's best non-sexual friend. He's gorgeous, a model, bisexual with a very wandering eye, and lousy impulse control. He and Trey, a part-time photographer's assistant pursuing a degree as a veterinarian, are trying to make it work. As long as Trey doesn't mind an opportunistic Tatiana Cherlin in bed as well. Ian was part of an orgy in [[ASIN:0425263916 Reflected in You]], and Gideon \\"explained\\" to him what Eva's no meant.<br /><br />Gideon's family includes:<br />Chris Vidal, Jr., is Gideon's nasty half-brother. His dad, Christopher Vidal, Sr., is Gideon's mother's husband, and he runs Vidal Records in which Gideon has a majority share. Elizabeth, both boys' mother, is determined that Eva won't take her son from him. Why this concerns her has me clueless...<br /><br />Arnoldo Ricci owns Tableau One, a restaurant, in partnership with Gideon. Dr. Terry Lucas and his wife, Anne, are Gideon's enemies. Magdalene, a former hopeful of Gideon's, has a new man in her life, Gage. Corinne Giroux is an old flame of Gideon's: his former ideal, only she just hasn't gotten the message. And Corinne will do anything to get him back. Jean-François Giroux, Corinne's husband, loves her, but he only seems to understand being rude.<br /><br />Eva's Co-Workers at Waters Field & Leaman<br />Megumi is the receptionist and one of Eva's friends. She's falling for her blind date, Michael, a commitment-phobic guy. Mark Garrity is her boss, a junior account manager, and he's facing karma over his no to his life partner, Steven Ellison, a contractor. Shawna Ellison is Steve's sister. Will Granger is a new hire whom Eva is helping with lunch. Lacey goes along with the girls on their girls' night out and whom Eva hooks up with Martin. Christine Field and Walter Leaman are the principals.<br /><br />Eva's Family<br />Victor Reyes is an Oceanside, California, street cop, Eva's dad, poor, and still in love with Eva's mother, Monica. Monica Tramell Barker Mitchell Stanton, however, refuses to live without money; love just won't keep them together. The money helps her to set all sorts of seriously intrusive security on her daughter. Richard Stanton is her third---and very wealthy---husband. Martin is Richard's son, and he goes clubbing with his friends: Kurt and Andre. Benjamin Clancy is her stepfather's personal bodyguard, and Eva finds out just how concerned the married Clancy is. Nathan Barker is a former stepbrother who molested Eva and was murdered in [[ASIN:0425263916 Reflected in You]].<br /><br />Dr. Lyle Petersen is Eva's mother's therapist and now hers and Gideon's. Parker Smith is a Krav Maga instructor with whom Eva trains.<br /><br />Brett Kline, the lead singer for Six-Ninths, is an old boyfriend of Eva's, and he wants her back. I love how Day describes his voice: S-E-X rolled in chocolate...yummy... He and his band are signed with Vidal Records and have a video coming out. Darrin is part of the band. Sam Yimara was the band's videographer; seems he's been a naughty boy.<br /><br />Detectives Shelly Graves and Richard Michna of the NYPD may well be setting traps. Andrei Ydemsky is a Russian mobster wearing incriminating evidence.<br /><br />Deanna Johnson is a freelance reporter much too interested in anything Gideon, especially if Eva will dish the dirt on the guy who dumped her.<br /><br />The Cover<br />The cover is black and muted greens with a pair of patent leather luggage tags and Gideon's name.<br /><br />I suspect the title is a reference to the ending in this story, one in which each of them is Entwined with You.lionaire running Cross Industries with his own traumas to cope with.

Ian was part of an orgy in [[ASIN:0425263916 Reflected in You]], and Gideon \\"explained\\" to him what Eva's no meant.<br /><br />Gideon's family includes:<br />Chris Vidal, Jr., is Gideon's nasty half-brother. His dad, Christopher Vidal, Sr., is Gideon's mother's husband, and he runs Vidal Records in which Gideon has a majority share. Elizabeth, both boys' mother, is determined that Eva won't take her son from him. Why this concerns her has me clueless...<br /><br />Arnoldo Ricci owns Tableau One, a restaurant, in partnership with Gideon. Dr. Terry Lucas and his wife, Anne, are Gideon's enemies. Magdalene, a former hopeful of Gideon's, has a new man in her life, Gage. Corinne Giroux is an old flame of Gideon's: his former ideal, only she just hasn't gotten the message. And Corinne will do anything to get him back. Jean-François Giroux, Corinne's husband, loves her, but he only seems to understand being rude.<br /><br />Eva's Co-Workers at Waters Field & Leaman<br />Megumi is the receptionist and one of Eva's friends. She's falling for her blind date, Michael, a commitment-phobic guy. Mark Garrity is her boss, a junior account manager, and he's facing karma over his no to his life partner, Steven Ellison, a contractor. Shawna Ellison is Steve's sister. Will Granger is a new hire whom Eva is helping with lunch. Lacey goes along with the girls on their girls' night out and whom Eva hooks up with Martin. Christine Field and Walter Leaman are the principals.<br /><br />Eva's Family<br />Victor Reyes is an Oceanside, California, street cop, Eva's dad, poor, and still in love with Eva's mother, Monica. Monica Tramell Barker Mitchell Stanton, however, refuses to live without money; love just won't keep them together. The money helps her to set all sorts of seriously intrusive security on her daughter. Richard Stanton is her third---and very wealthy---husband. Martin is Richard's son, and he goes clubbing with his friends: Kurt and Andre. Benjamin Clancy is her stepfather's personal bodyguard, and Eva finds out just how concerned the married Clancy is. Nathan Barker is a former stepbrother who molested Eva and was murdered in [[ASIN:0425263916 Reflected in You]].<br /><br />Dr. Lyle Petersen is Eva's mother's therapist and now hers and Gideon's. Parker Smith is a Krav Maga instructor with whom Eva trains.<br /><br />Brett Kline, the lead singer for Six-Ninths, is an old boyfriend of Eva's, and he wants her back. I love how Day describes his voice: S-E-X rolled in chocolate...yummy... He and his band are signed with Vidal Records and have a video coming out. Darrin is part of the band. Sam Yimara was the band's videographer; seems he's been a naughty boy.<br /><br />Detectives Shelly Graves and Richard Michna of the NYPD may well be setting traps. Andrei Ydemsky is a Russian mobster wearing incriminating evidence.<br /><br />Deanna Johnson is a freelance reporter much too interested in anything Gideon, especially if Eva will dish the dirt on the guy who dumped her.<br /><br />The Cover<br />The cover is black and muted greens with a pair of patent leather luggage tags and Gideon's name.<br /><br />I suspect the title is a reference to the ending in this story, one in which each of them is Entwined with You.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i love it its like taking care of a real horsey awww and my kids love it thanks a whole bunch
B00BQ1D7X4|3.0|I have been an AIC fan since \\"Dirt\\", which is still one of my favorite albums of all time, from any band.  I have absolutely nothing against the new \\"relaunch\\" of the band with \\"Black Gives way to Blue\\", it was an enjoyable album,  dark and morose, the way I like it!<br /><br />Now, this album on the other hand, falls flat.  I get kind if bored with it, and it just seems to lack *depth and character* I have come to expect from AIC, it is dull and lifeless.<br /><br />Other people have compared it to Cantrell's solo stuff, and I will agree, because IMHO, Cantrell's solo stuff was dull.  Layne really contributed the \\"life\\" or \\"feeling\\" to the AIC music, which although talented, Cantrell lacks. After BGWTB I was very impressed with Duvall's ability to breath a different life into the songs, not the same (which is good), and at the same time kind of \\"cloning\\" Layne's lyrical styling. I have to admit that I was happy Duvall has changed it up a bit with this newest album and explored a different lyrical style. There is a *whole LOT* of potential here, that is just not hitting the mark. To sum it up, very mediocre, and a bit disappointing. Maybe next time guys, I hope.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fantastic game. The game helps  strengthen your memory and deductive skills.  I enjoyed how the levels became progressively more difficult.  The only drawback is that it nees more levels.
6305922756|5.0|I can't believe how many people have still not seen this movie!  Everytime I reference it and get a blank stare, I order it and insist that person watch for themselves.  It is still incredible relevant and hilarious!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Love the game but it is a bit hard for kids. I wish you could buy different minions with bananas
B0055PMJMW|5.0|I have read every full length Harry Bosch novel and found it was refreshing to read a few short stories. Michael Connelly has once again shown his talent for writing
B00DMM3WVM|1.0|Needs more Facebook and posts about irrelevant crap that n o e needs! Go create an account on my site!
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|This book will inspire you with new ideas and help you look at your life with a new eyes. It confirmed many things I have always believed as a self produced musician. You can have the life you want if you are ready to step out and give it your all
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is the best i Am going 2 See the 2nd one today it going to be great this game is just like temple
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I thought this game was going to be similar to the '100 Floors' game but this is much better &amp; it's not as easy as it looks! Definitely a good game to occupy your time.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app.  It has replaced both my hand-held and my desk top calculators.  It is easy to use and extremely accurate.  The ads are small and way up above the calculator.  I never even notice they are there.  I would highly recommend this app to anyone.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Another great of example of Joss' amazing story telling.  Fun story and great cast.  Highly recommend it!  PS - Really disappointed in you FOX for cancelling this series so quickly.  Epic fail IMHO.
B000JCSBU0|1.0|Ridiculous movie.  Don't know how it got so many good reviews.  Don't waste your time.  If you fancy the perspective of a drug addict loser, then maybe this is for you.
B00000J2PH|5.0|Great Music - reminds me of my college years......lots of good tunes and she is awesome.<br />Takes me back to great memories.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Exciting continuance of the action n the first book. Katnis bravely fights the Capitol for the freedom of the people. Lots of action required to complete the revolution. Looking forward to Mockingjay.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This is a great love story I think better than Fifty Shades and can't wait for the Fourth Book. The Love between these two are what we all hope to have in our life.
B00C2U6G7C|1.0|I watched because I was told that this was a good movie!!! ROTFL !!!<br /><br />This sorrowful, dark and brooding excuse for a  movie had the children frightened through half of it and with the cursing, I winced at a Superman movie where I felt ashamed to have my children watch.<br /><br />I disliked this movie with a vengeance. Superman is not a maladjusted character. He is the ultimate do gooder, a good guy, well balance brought up with good values on a farm with decent, simple folk whom he loved and who loved him. he was not disrespectful and rude. He was a do gooder from teenage days when he was Superboy! He was  not off on at sea brooding, solitary and morose!<br /><br />In a crowd he was not noticed except when he puts on his costume. This reminds me of the disaster of the reimagined Star Trek.  We have superman in a costume that is a combination of Spiderman 3 and Batman. Dark, brooding and depressing! pathetic.<br /><br />This modern trend of having these maladjusted, angry, brooding heroes with neuroses to identify with the new 21ts century movie goer who has ADD and cannot follow a movie unless something is exploding is a sad reflection of what producers, directors and movie companies think they must do to make a buck.<br /><br />There was no logical storyline, no character development, in a fact I cared more for the soldiers than for the main actors! I felt no connection with this superman or Lois Lane whatsoever. The children were not flying with him. In fact one 9 year old asked which one was superman?  Even the children did not know who the good guy was!<br /><br />I will definitely NOT by buying or recommending this piece of trash to anyone.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I like the colors of the tiles but I dont like that they fly in the path of the playing field. Kind of a distraction. Better if they moved away from the<br />remaining tiles.
0670026638|5.0|Ozeki's style is filled with what seem like off-handed metaphors whose meanings are both subtle and vivid, that you might think you're watching this on film. The rice-paper thinness of the prose belies its hidden depths, and makes reading this into something totally experiential. It's as if the story washes over you like a lightly perfumed mist or dances on your thoughts like the whisper of a sweet, fresh breeze of spring on the air. In short, \\"A Tale for the Time Being\\" is a totally unique novel and one that will probably create its own sort of earthquake and tsunami - and rightly so, because it is just that marvelous.<br /><br />Ruth Ozeki's novel \\"A Tale for the Time Being\\" deserves far more than only five stars out of five, and isn't just highly recommended, it should be mandatory reading! If you read only one book this year, make it this one.
B008OD38JK|4.0|Would love to purchase the original Batman Trilogy soundtracks directly from movies (I have all three separately) but this is a nice fill in and isn't made cheap.
B008220BLG|4.0|MINI REVIEW: the humor in this picture echoes the superior \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" yet this is still a fun flick. A zombie man narrates the tale, realizing that his life sucks and he misses being a human. It isn't until an attack on humans that said man sees a girl and falls in love and wouldn't you know it but love starts to bring the zombies back. But don't worry. There is another group of undead nicknamed \\"Boneys\\" who are beyond being cured and don't want anybody else happy. Good romance tale in the post apocalypse tale with a soundtrack using 70s and 80s music. A few scenes are surprisingly funny and then a lot get a chuckle. Based on Isaac Marion's novel by the same name and starring John Malkovich, Nicholas Hoult and a host of others. OVERALL GRADE ON THE SHANNON SCALE: B to B plus.
B003WE9TU8|4.0|Havent seen the movie, not sure that I will. loved the book, the different stories from around the world, how different cultures saw the 'crisis' and how they fixed the 'problems'
B00CDV6WDS|3.0|Its ok, nothing special. Just Mahjong, nothing more with no special anything. If you're a Mahjong fan you won't be let down
B007F8META|4.0|I was an always have been a huge Mission Impossible fan. Loved the series and have really liked the movies. Although some of the things they do with special effects are a little other worldly........the movie is fast paced and fun
B004P1JDJO|5.0|Resisting the temptation to highlight every page is hard. This will be a reread for me. Business leaders will want to find ways to apply these lessons.
B001GKJ2FC|5.0|Special effects, a great cast and story make this must see. Jolie is sexy and deadly at the same time, and Morgan Freeman is one of those actors you just love to see in a film
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't have much to add to all of the great things other have already said about this book.  It's a fantastically entertaining  read that takes place in a lucid and horrifying world.  An edge-of-your-seat page turner of the likes I haven't experienced in a long time.  This is sure to be a classic.
B001KS0THU|5.0|This is a classic with two top billings and a supportive cast. John Wayne (who I met) is just as you would expect. There are some classics across the spectrum of all movies. This and a few other JW movies are just that.
B001NP8PQW|4.0|I really only bought this tho see disintegration live on Bluray.  The sound is superb but the stage show s minimal...however I didn't expect much from the kings of Goth.  Really was never into Bloodflowers and Porography...would rather have seen Head on the door, Kiss Me kiss me, and disintegration...now that would have been an epic trilogy!
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|The movie was a bit predictive because of it being such an old story, almost an easy plot to figure out--but the makers did create some gruesome characters that even as an adult I thought they were a bit creepy. Not bad for an evening's chiller. I give it 3 1/2 bowls of popcorn
B002RBZ13Q|5.0|Was never a big fan of this band but oddly enough I knew most if the songs. Great sound and picture on Bluray, one must have disk...I play it often. A few songs in the middle are a little weaker but still good overall. Long concert and great stage presence...these guys are a great rock band.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|I really didn't realize how slow this movie was going to be. I mean there were some decent flight scenes, but overall it really didn't flow well. Obv Denzel was great in it, as he always is, but it just came off weird to me. I give it three stars.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I enjoy fiction and especially King novels. This was thought provoking and interesting to address what can happen if you could go back and change time.  Along with a love story that takes its toll on your psyche.
B00003CXXP|5.0|Came on time and played perfectly. Absolutely loved this movie years ago and I think with every time I watch it I love it even more!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|New version has way to much going on; no hourly details. Background too bright &amp; glaring; unable to read.the screen. Very disappointed miss the old version. Have uninstalled the new version.
B00881VLCE|2.0|UPDATE:  I wanted to update my last response because it appears the program has calmed down and behaving normally again.  I am not sure how or what happened but I am thrilled to once again enjoy this program.  However, there are some new features that I still don't like with the most annoying one being the different size options for the number of puzzle pieces.  If I choose the smallest number, the puzzle is too easy.  If I choose the one I would like to work on, the puzzle pieces are so small, I simply cannot see them on my Kindle Fire.  So, my only option is to choose the next size up from the easiest number of pieces which is not really much of a challenge, but at least the pieces can be identified.  I realize this may not be an \\"application\\" issue but a Kindle issue, but I would like to point out that I did not have any trouble viewing ANY of the size pieces prior to this last update.  Summary:  There is still room for improvement.<br /><br />This app WAS one of my favorites untill a recent update that I wish I had not DONE!  Now. when trying to do any puzzle. the pieces are \\"jerky\\" and extremely difficult to move across the screen.  Also. the size options are different.  Such a dissapointment.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I unlocked all the characters on my I pod ithink I can do it again on this one but overall its cool.<br /><br />sincerely theshmiz
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is an excellent app, my daughter (5) and I love to sit and play together. It is sometimes frustrating but good mental exercise can't beat it for free!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is lots of fun. I like it very much. Yell if you smell that honky tonk man. I like turtles t oo
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A good read for women and men. This book gives insight to what goes on from a woman's perspective. I can honestly say I learned a little more about the opposite sex.
B00DBSZJRM|1.0|This is so bad it will become a cult film ... in about 20 years.  Don't bother till then.  (Even then, not till after consuming lots of mind alternating chemicals.)<br /><br />ADDED 15 August:  There must an internet campaign to post such high ratings.  The movie only grossed $55 mil at the box office, far less than it cost to produce.  And it scores only 15% at rottentomatoes.com (107 bad reviews; 19 good).
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|It's a good game but you have to have a internet connection to do ANYthing.But it is a pretty good game.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|Hugh Weaving (Agent Smith from the Matrix) does a great job as the mysterious V.  I'm not a big Natalie Portman fan, but even she is OK.  Will watch again !!
B00CFO7PK2|5.0|oh my god.... its one of the most greates álbum ever and buika voice is wonderfull i love it totally unexpected
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|And excellent story. Non-stop laughs, mixed with stress and tension.  Cooper and Lawrence are fantastic.  Well deserving of the Oscar nod.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I really like this game,  I love the seek n ' find/hidden object games. I really enjoy this game except that its Sucks when my energy runs out.
1781162646|4.0|What is Joyland? A summer of firsts. First love. Summer job. First broken heart. Summer friends. First s*x affair. Joyland is pure nostalgia and a look back at a long passed (lost?) youth by a man in his sixties. Joyland is pure nostalgia and the remembrance of a time in one's life where even if tragic things were happening -- the future was laid out in front of you like a map and it seemed like an adventure.<br /><br />Joyland is told from the point of view of an older man remembering a summer from his college years in the early 1970s -- Devin. For summer break, Devin applies to work at an amusement park in the south along the Atlantic coast -- Joyland. Joyland is an amusement park of America's past, just like Devin's youth. The park is not Disney, it is not big and shiny, but owned by one man and held together with hope and the desire to provide fun.<br /><br />Joyland is not just a nostalgic stroll down the memory of someone long past youth - this is a Stephen King novel! And because it is a Stephen King novel it involves murder, death, pain, mystery and ghosts interwoven with a story of the past. Or maybe, is the murder, mystery and ghost a way to tell a nostalgic story? Maybe that is what King is doing here. The story is youth. The story is remembering. And the story is nostalgia. The setting is the summer of 1973 and a southern amusement park and this provides King with an opportunity to create a unique world that almost seems fantastical and is populated by a cast of interesting characters. Life long carnies, a widowed homeowner who rents out rooms and serves to tell the history of the murder, a disgraced single mom of a dying boy, a ghost of a murdered woman, and idealistic college kids working for the summer -- these are the characters of Joyland.<br /><br />The murder is not shocking, not for 2013 sensibilities and not for readers who have seen even just one episode of CSI or Law and Order, but the story is not centered on the shock or the gore of the murder but the mystery of who did it, who was murdered and why. Joyland won't keep you up at night from fear and you likely won't remember the details of the story a few days or weeks after you put it down, but while you are immersed in the story you will experience the summer of 1973. And that is the beauty of this story, the re-living of youth, the experiencing a different time in a special place -- and the carny talk.<br /><br />Joyland is short, less than 9 narrated hours and about 283 pages. It is a quick read and one you can immerse yourself in immediately. Like Joyland and amusement parks like it, once I finished reading Joyland the story slipped through the cracks in my memory. This story is good entertainment; it is a fast ride that involves some quick turns and ups and downs; it is fun but it is not long lasting.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like by th this game<br />It is one th hat can be played over and over again<br />Th her e are to many quests to complete for me
0385341008|4.0|This book is great as an intro to literary device and education but re the story of the Channel occupation ..well...please read the memoir by John Lewis which should be republished so it too can hit No 1 on the NY Times list...A DOCTOR'S OCCUPATION ...surely the authoresses could have saved themselves lots of research time by reading this record of the Jersey occupation...much richer in historical detail and anecdote and at least as good a book.  It'll need a new cover though...less warlike for today's tastes...I read Occupation before Guernsey...and saw the excellent BBC series Island at War previously as well...<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0082R0062 Shub Down & Small-up Yuself!

B009XIXVU6|5.0|I have read TKR and ATSS's and found this just as bit as good.  The author showing growth as a writer.  An exceptional read.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|After just coming from seeing the new movie this game is saying my desire for more minion antics. I love these guys and this Temple Run style game is well done.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I can not believe the popularity of this book. I did not find it erotic at all and has resulted in a higher birth rate as a result. I.  Did not find it entertaining almost immediately but was. Determined to read the entire book and reserve judgement.  It was a silly premise with a huge let-down ending.<br /><br />Another person making tons of undeserved wealth.
B005F9TQ0Q|5.0|I've heard bad reviews of this album and I am going to have to strongly disagree with them all. Anyone who doesn't like this album is a complete idiot. This is one of my favorite Dylan albums. The songs give a great variety from upbeat to just plain sad. There are no bad songs on this album. I listen to it from front to back probably 3 or 4 times per week. The effect of the two versions of &#34;Forever Young&#34; is not the same on cd as is on tape or vinyl but if you remember that after the slow, first version, you'd be flippin' it over to side two you can see the effect it had better. Some great songs on this album. &#34;Going, going, gone&#34;, &#34;Hazel&#34;, &#34;Dirge&#34;, &#34;Wedding Song&#34;. All great songs. &#34;On a Night Like This&#34; is a great way to start things off. Buy this album. Well worth the money.
B005LAIII0|5.0|This was a fantastic movie and everything I was expecting when I ordered it.  The movie, sound, color was all fantastic.<br />I would recommend this movie to all movie buffs!!!!!
B00000255X|5.0|If you like &#34;Blood on the Tracks&#34; then this album is the next obvious step to take. &#34;Planet Waves&#34; and &#34;Desire&#34; make up the 3 parts of Dylan's mid-70's high point. Great blend of music. More upbeat than &#34;Blood on the Tracks&#34;. Some beautiful songs here such as &#34;One More Cup of Coffee&#34; and &#34;Sara&#34;. &#34;Oh, Sister&#34; is also one that I like quite a bit. The violin and female backing vocals give this album a unique sound that works very well. I am a big Dylan fan and these mid-70's albums &#34;Planet Waves&#34;, &#34;Blood on the Tracks&#34; and &#34;Desire&#34; are some of his best work ever, topped (in my opinion) only by his work in the 60's. Check this album out. &#34;Desire&#34; is a must for Dylan fans.
B0014DQSGW|5.0|Sandra Bullock is great at comedy and the pairing in this romantic comedy is just spot on.  A great chick flick,
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is the best game ever. You have all these different type of dragons and you can get special ones too. I couldn't put this game down. I really enjoyed this game.
B006M7JCC2|4.0|Gracefully written, easy to read and understand Anita Moorjani describes her remarkable journey that clearly demarcates a 'before and after' she almost died. Her NDE helped her understand the purpose of her life today which includes encouraging people to 'be their magnificent selves', to appreciate and love ourselves rather than submit to a fear-based existence that suggests a disowning of our selves and this state may result in crime, illness and negativity. Her message corroborates the importance of living joyfully in the present, remembering our connection to everyone and everything.
B00005N6KG|5.0|do not have the time for your survey. love your service otherwise. do not bother me again with this sort of survey.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Yes I know folks. this is a cheat app ..but why is Amazon so backwards!! offering a cheat app but doesn't have the game?? makes absolutely no sense. you'd think with all the bad reviews out about this same nonsense, they'd get it together.
B00AQ71FLK|3.0|great game on the go; servers need to be fixed too much lag great game. the lag keeps me from giving this game a 5 star
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway suffers is a fun game that update every two weeks so its always fun and awesome and just plain cool
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Like all the different rooms u enter. It would be helpful if it a map of rooms to refer to though.
B004XZR63M|5.0|this is a must read for every working american that wants more out of life. i read it on my kindle and now am going to buy one for each of my kids that are young adults and only a few years into the working world. i wish i had this enformation when i was still in high school.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|one of my friends had a Weaphones app, but it had some glitches. This game has none!!!! I love it and rate it 999999999 $tars!!!!!!!<br />:)
0062280228|5.0|I was never compelled to write a review until now. The author has a way of pulling you in with the first paragraph. I, too, could not put the book down. The author has such a way with words that you are transfixed on the story line and transported to another world. As noted by another reviewer, you become involved with the characters and care about them. You are also very disappointed that the story ends, despite one that is most fitting. If you have not been impressed with any book lately, try this one for something unique and enjoyable.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Very easy to use, display is easy on the eyes and the alarm settings accomplish their tasks effortless. A very strong recommendation.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|this game is definitely worth it! its so much fun and it has a variety of different patterns. I love this app!! I recommend it to everybody.
B0095MVOMC|4.0|Although this is not the type of game I generally play it was a FAOTD and so I checked it out. The graphics are nice, the background music pleasant, and some of the hidden numbers are quite clever. I see that some people have complained about the timer in the game for each level. Fortunately there's a setting in &#34;options&#34; that allows you to turn-on or turn-off the timer.<br /><br />If you're a fan of searching for hidden objects then this is a game worth checking out.
0553801546|5.0|I was truly sorry to read the end of this series because I didn't want it to end. Perhaps more will be written about the children in single books later. I definitely want to know more about the Fool's actions after this as he will live a very long time. I read the Liveship trader's trilogy just to read about the Fool's journey there. (A character in the first book presents herself and interludes that part in Fool's Errand.) Perhaps some books about the children, or King Shrewd's tale. How is &#34; Shrewd is as Shrewd does'?
B0068LYEHA|5.0|I just turned 35 and I found this book to be completely relevant and hilariously accurate.  My 62 year old mother found some humor in it too, but most of it went over her head.  The way Moran borders inappropriateness is fascinating to me.  Highly recommend this one to my fellow thirty something gals.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|This is a wonderful film.  Mr. Spielberg has taken the historical figure of Lincoln and made him into the actual man he was.  He's seen not only as a man trying to keep a country from destroying itself; but also as a husband and loving father.  Only Daniel Day-Lewis could have brought the heart and soul to this character.  This film is a &#34;must have&#34; for all fans of President Lincoln and historical stories.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This was a great series.  Never knew what was coming next in any of the books.  Great way to wrap it up.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Best game ever!! Fun and challenging!!! Its very addictive!!! We all play it!! Unicorns I love them, unicorns I love :)
0316182060|5.0|Read all her books including her new series - Etiquette & Espionage, so went on to read the Manga versions. - LOVE!
B00BC5AWNM|5.0|I greatly admire this book. However, not when I first read it (which was many years ago when I was a school kid). And even the second time I read it (aged 21), I was dubious as to my thoughts regarding its merits. I felt that it was very witty, eloquent prose and rather challenging, but I found myself skipping pages to get to the crucial bits of the plot. It was my third attempt that transformed my opinion of this novel. I was rendered fascinated, repulsed and horrified. I became obsessed with reading about those who live sordid, self-indulgent debauchery such as heroin addicts (while i listened to Requiem for Dream - composed by Clint Mansell)<br /><br />I ventured to read it a third time because I'd had just watched a brilliant ballet production (based on the book) at Saddlers Wells theatre (Angel, London) and I suppose I was in a morbid frame of mind. I decided another perusal of this book was necessary and that's when I appreciated it. It was morbid, gothic, and left me haunted. I began in fact researching the effects of opium and started paying more attention to the heroin addicts at the homeless shelter (as well as donating to charities which dealt with education and prevention).<br /><br />This book \\"touched\\" me in a way that left me haunted with its affect for some time. Its well worth reading. But don't expect a happy ending
B00068S41I|4.0|My late mother-in-law loved this movie & watched it repeatedly -- it stood up well, largely because of the fine actors on both ends of the age spectrum: Gena Rowlands & James Garner vs. Rachel McAdams & Ryan Gosling.  Your heart must be made of lead if this doesn't touch you.
0486278077|5.0|“I have grown to love secrecy. It seems to be the one thing that can make modern life mysterious or marvellous to us. The commonest thing is delightful if only one hides it.”<br /><br />“You will always be fond of me.

However, not when I first read it (which was many years ago when I was a school kid). And even the second time I read it (aged 21), I was dubious as to my thoughts regarding its merits.

159463176X|5.0|Hosseini is truly gifted storyteller.  It is a multigenerational story of compassion, love and a deep bond between to siblings that survive through adverse times of poverty and betrayal of everything that they believe in as a family.  A very passionate story.
0060786523|4.0|This book brings India to life. I read this in my mid-teens. I was utterly surprised by it. I didn't realise middle class India was very similar to Middle Class England. India is vast and this book will not be able to encompass it all, however, it provides a beautiful glimpse of India post-Independence. An India that is forming its identity.<br /><br />The writing style is excellent (although a tad dramatic at times). For some the book may drag, but for those who enjoy details this is the book for you.<br /><br />The author is excellent in depicting the characters' political and personal struggles, the many different faces of India from the modern Western to the traditional, the educated intellects to the superficial socialites. Its an engrossing fascinating study and well worth the time invested in reading it.
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|My son and me watched this movie several times. It feels we have never seen this before.  We like to watch it over and over.
0399162097|5.0|Wow.  What an amazingly unique novel.  WE ARE ALL COMPLETELY BESIDE OURSELVES is so eloquently written with a wide range of vocabulary and a unique telling of the narrator's story.  It was especially interesting to me, because I am a young psychology major and there were many elements of the book I could relate to and learn from.<br /><br />I will admit that, in the beginning, it was hard to keep reading because I am a teen and it is summer and I like to have nice, easy, romantic books to read poolside.  This book is not a nice and easy teen romance book.  This book is a psychological glimpse into the mind of a young girl who grew up with a chimp and loved her as her own sister.  This book is about remembering, not suppressing, painful events that have happened in your life, because although it would be easy to compartmentalize and forget, those events shaped who you are today and who you will be tomorrow.  If you want to move forward in your life, first you must understand who you are and why you are that way.<br /><br />I was completely entranced by every aspect of this novel: syntax, diction, plot, chronology.  I gained some good life lessons (and unique vocabulary) from the amazing novel that is WE ARE ALL COMPLETELY BESIDE OURSELVES. I would definitely recommend it to anyone of any age.  There is something to be learned for everyone.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|It is good they broke this up into more than one movie. Glad I was able to see both at once.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really think it is a great game with the minions<br />I love it. Super good and the kids will laugh with greatness
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|love how it all happens in 24 hours. Dan Brown keeps you wanting to turn the next page. Always good stuff.
B005FISBTO|3.0|I have become a huge fan of Dexter. That having been said, this was an extremely disappointing season. The kills were. . . well, just too preposterous to be honest. I keep asking my wife \\"HOW DOES HE NOT GET CAUGHT?\\" Then there is the whole ****SPoiler alert**** Debra in love with Dexter thing, that is just too weird. Then the preposterous way in which she catches him making the kill of DDK. Come on, the writers of an excellent series like this could have been more inventive about it. Ever since the death of Rita, this show has gone down hill in my opinion. Just my opinion\\" I own all of the first 7 seasons\\" and I will buy the 8th when it becomes available. But, I honestly hope 7 and 8 get better. ****Spoiler alert over***** Should you buy it, I did. Not that, I am saying run out and get it, but if you don't then the franchise will become a MOD (Made on Demand) and they will be produced on DVD-R dvd's with BS quality and artwork. No one wants that, so support the poor starving folks at the studios and buy this one. But, don't be disappointed with the storyline, and don't say Ralphie didn't warn ya.<br /><br />But, tell em' you read another review by. . . Wait for it. . .<br /><br />Ralph J. Fitcher
B00BSBUZPK|3.0|Somebody needs to make a history of the Eagles that isn't an Eagles product.  This was OK, but knowing how it must have been tailored to make the Eagles comfortable with it makes it suspect to me.  I'd like to see a little more of the unvarnished truth.  I can't find anything really critical to say of this production, but I can't find anything exceptionally good that would make me rave about it either.  I guess I can say I was mildly interested as it took me back my youth.  Wow, I can say I saw the Eagles at the Des Moines State Fair ground in 1975 (along with Dan Folgelberg and the Ozark Mountain Daredevils), so they weren't real popular yet.  I was enamoured with One of the These Nights that summer.  Don't remember the concert at all.<br /><br />BTW, I really didn't like Glenn Frey when I was done watching this, and for him to call himself an actor made me laugh.  I don't honestly believe either Frey or Henley were the great musicians in this band, just the good song writers.  This band really did need Felder and Walsh, and yet they were treated rather badly by the Big Two from my point of view.
B00C061HZY|5.0|Yes yes yay hurray.  Came fast! And even if it didn't you have a download code and it is a well worth tge wait album
B004TUKNX6|5.0|What can you say - this was the Rush golden period - everything was great.<br />This, plus Hemispheres, Permanent Waves and Farewell to Kings is that period
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|game was great and fun unroll new updates now I can't. even open the game. What is going on? I love playing when I can but I am ready to uninstall now that it tells me there is no Internet connection when all my other Internet games work except this one.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I liked this game, I like that it made me have to remember patterns and numbers and where I found clues.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved all three books.  This one was just as good as the other two and wrapped things up, but yet I would still read more.  Looking forward to seeing more from Sylvia.

B009ZZDNT6|1.0|Because I got it yesterday thinking it would be good for school nights  but no I had not even gotten on the app and it went off the next morning at 8:OO when I wanted to sleep till 10 then I couldn't go back to sleep...<br />CRAP THESE HUMAN EARS OF MINE!<br />LOL
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Works great with my galaxy III, can take my books anywhere without carrying all that papaer and weight. Works great
B004QX07G4|3.0|I WAS LOOKING FOR MORE OF AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY BOOK.  THIS IS NOT WHAT I expected.<br />It would be. SO DISAPPOINTED.......
B003G4W49C|5.0|Its a book that gets you wrapped up in its story. I have read and re-read Ender's Game several times now, and still I have a hard time putting it down. I would recommend it to anyone. I read it for the first time in 4th grade.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I found the book very honest & funny.  The characters were fun to get to know, and I think we all know some of them
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This has been one of the best games I have ever played.  I have played games on Pogo and Facebook, I have not found a better game to play. There are hours of fun and now with the stationary set it is even better. The game is worth the price and I have not found any problems at all. It would be a game that can be enjoyed by both adults and children. The updates come in regularly  and keeps the game exciting.  Take the chance, buy the game at $.99 and you are guaranteed hours of fun.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is great!<br />I love playing it. Whenever I have nothing to do I go on my tablet and start taking care of my horse.
B004SIP9VA|5.0|Saw the movie when it first came out and liked it then.  My original DVD disappeared and had to replace it.
0061537969|5.0|We all have metaphors that we live by and our own ways of finding our interconnectedness. This is an excellent representation of those two and, for those who have a strong respect for the animals in your life, this is a wonderful lens.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I LOVE THIS!!!! game its the most awesome game ever<br />I could play THIS for ever and ever I love it
B00CHIY5OK|5.0|This album is outstading! Latch is one of the best songs i've heard this year, luckily the rest of the album is excellent as well.
B0069UP2PI|5.0|Viewed the video and used it for a classroom experience related to epidemiology<br />The producers did their home work.<br />Students felt it was a great learning experience.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Easy game at first but gets progressively harder &agrave;s the game continues. It is a good way to keep the mind sharp occasionally. The timed game is much more challenging.  I would reccomend this one.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I'm impressed by this charger. With the ones I had so far, my HTC Rezound would drain the battery when I was using the phone as a GPS in the car.<br />Not with this Anker! It charges it to full even having the GPS on, Bluetooth on for the headset and 4G running.<br />And I can use the second port to charge my external battery pack.<br /><br />Also like that it fits very tight into the 12V outlet.
B0092S4WLY|1.0|Not as fun as others like it.  Seems short and clunky.  Better ones out there to play.  Not much replay value.
B008KH8XRC|5.0|Photo Finish is a great example of some of Rory Gallagher's finest work.  The sweetest leads, over the fantastic rhythms surrounded by some of the greatest lyrics sung by the deeply sincere and real person Rory Gallagher was. We miss you Rory!!! RIP
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is tight. I play it at both my jobs. At home. Everywhere I'm bored at. Get high scores, unlock armored and play multiple bosses and missions.
B004F4HWPS|5.0|Greatness all over the place.  Coming In From The Cold....  itself is worth the price of admission.  One Love One Heart
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|Entertaining. This is not just a sci-fi show. There are plenty of other things going on. I got so attached to the characters.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|I wish it had a multi player function.  But the game is well worth 9.99. I also wish it gave more deck options.
B000002IRL|5.0|I've been a Metal Head for 35 years and this is one of the best metal albums I have ever heard. This is a must have for any metal collection. Killer riffs, lead solos, and vocals.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|I like the game as there is no such a complex game as harmful as this one. The hero in the game play an important role. You should pay more attention to it or he dead soon.
0375842209|4.0|I would certainly recommend this book to any teenager and adults alike. I was used to reading stories about the Third Reich from the view of a Jewish person, so this book drew me in by having another point of view, from the other side of it all. There was a poetic tone to the book and it left me thinking, exactly what a book should do. I was a little put off by death's narration. I just wasn't sure what ot make of it. Was it cliche, or an author's genius? It did seem more cliche, though. But all-in-all, a fantastic novel filled with bold writing choices.
B00785P2QC|4.0|The game is pretty good. It sometimes messes up but other than that is is a good game and i would recommend it.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Objects are not that easy to find, even in HD. Good story line keeps you coming back for more. Would give 5stars if it didn't require you to pay for the full version.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Very fun and addictive. Will recommend to all my friends and family. Graphics remind me of the Moon Patrol on Atari 2600
B008BU75IQ|4.0|It's an easy book to read, and has some good descriptions of surroundings. But the dilemmas were easily solved..... and weren't surprising. Good book for anyone who likes everything to work out perfectly. Even the ending cliffhanger is so predictable.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A great way to exercise your brain and test your intellect. If you like a challenge, then you will love this game.
0765325950|5.0|fantastic, i reread the whole series over again and this book was one of the best.  when i finished i just wanted to reread the whole series over again
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Really enjoy this game. I like how there are many activities to go with it. My son helps me with the feeding, treating, and stall cleanup.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Holy cow! If George Martin had written the Wizard of oz Scarecrow would have been burned, the lion butchered, the tin man melted down for scrap and when Dorothy finally got home, Auntie Em would be dead on the floor.  BUT I love the story -certainly not predictable - intricate interwoven plot lines, fantastic and real characters --none perfect --some far too real --so real their deaths in the story left me grieving-- and rushing to download the next in the series---surely at least one of my Stark family will survive---Winter is here!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. it's fun when you have to defeat everybody. My family all have it. We love this game I recommending it to anybody
B00DW2PDH8|5.0|Luna Sanguis is sumptuous.  Erotic.  Cultured.  Like a ten-course meal cooked by a naked lover.  Set in the artistic and intellectual soup that was Paris in the 20s - Picasso, Max von Schreck, Coco Chanel; the story also dips and weaves with history - Elizabeth Tudor, the Emperor Nero - as it blurs the lines between Gothic nightmare and great party.  Have I mentioned this is a vampire novel?<br />The story begins with a horrific murder and subsequent chase through the countryside on the outskirts of Paris.  A young woman, known as Eternal to herself and Delicate Rose to her tormentor and former lover, is found traumatized and suffering from amnesia by a passing farmer.  Hoping to help her, the farmer drops her off at a progressive Parisian psychiatric hospital where the very latest therapies are being given a go.<br />But not everything is as it seems.  Eternal cannot discern between reality, fantasy and memory.  She suffers great longing for the love of her life, but is at a loss as to whom that love might be.  To her revulsion, she also suffers from a debilitating hunger for something other than food.  And no, despite the erotic elements in this story, I'm not talking about sex.  It would appear Eternal is also, like her tormentor, a vampire.<br />What struck me most about Luna Sanguis was its celebration of beauty.  Even during the most graphic and violent scenes, an appreciation for the soft line of an exquisite profile, the lament of a woman's sob, the color of fresh blood, held the story together.  This is vampire legend in the vein of Anne Rice, not Twilight, and as an adult reader, I was delighted.
B006JD48NM|4.0|Great story! Very well done, Lots of information that I didn't know.Being an F1 fan this was well worth it.
B00CH26TL8|2.0|I played through the first 6 stages but was unable to get any potions, even when I scored three stars on each stage.  I have uninstalled the game.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Best game ever. Keeps my 8 year old busy...love it.<br /><br />Fun and very affordable. We have a good time building together.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book easy read<br />Loved it can't wait to read the last in the series. Will also look forward to the movies
630542828X|5.0|This movie is a little long but for those who enjoy legal drama, its wonderful. Travolta and actors do a wonderful job personifying the book characters. I would read the book also- it has more fascinating medical details!
B000067NY0|5.0|I am extremely pleased with this collectible!! It is an awesome addition to my collection!! Anyone who loves Iron Maiden should definitely add this to their collection!! Completely worth it!!
B00BEOYPKW|5.0|This cd is a great combination of real rocking music and also a nice dreamy vibe. It'll remind you of some great stuff you heard in the REM days but the sound is all his own. I'm playing it a lot
B007L3BMGA|2.0|The story was difficult to grasp initially then it just got out of hand.  I could see where it was leading and soon lost interest.  I didn't read all of it.  Perhaps for younger people.
B00BTHWFBK|3.0|I didn't expect much so I was surprised at how much they( and Rick Ruben) were trying to get that early sound back...and, it kinda' worked. I think that the bonus tracks are great songs...and, the best songs on the album. BTW, I am someone that thinks Sabbath w/Dio is the greatest band/music in the world.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|Good game to follow Rio.  Levels are challenging, and sometimes seem impossible (like the Danger Zone)  I recommend this game for the patient few.
B00946ZOT8|5.0|This doll is absolutely beautiful! She looks as much like Rosalie as a doll could look. I am very glad to have it and am plenning on getting the whole Cullen family
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Absolutely LOVE this game..The lil minions are so cute...Its fastly becoming my favorite game....It makes me feel better when I'm feeling down....
B009K0P10K|5.0|Greatest series ever, I order this for my kindle app on iPad. Can't wait for next season. If you don't watch it, the you should
B009TSA6YE|5.0|What a concert! I almost gave it 4 stars because of Doogie.  Either the songs are out of his range or he is lazy.  I suspect it is a little of both, as sometimes he is spot on, with higher notes, then botches the words.  How do you screw up the lyrics to On and On? Or course he messed up the words to a few others, and on all of the songs, he just slurred the words to the point of not being able to clearly understand them.  Gah! It was painful to watch him reach for high notes, and even more painful that he came up singing flat a lot.  A few spots were wince worthy.  Now that I have Doogie out of the way, let me just say that everything else MORE than makes up for him.  The older Michael gets, the better he plays. He has such a clear and pure tone. It is wonderful to see him back in top form, clean, healthy, and enjoying being on stage.  And although, a lot of Scorpions fans hate Francis Buchholz, I loved seeing him back on stage, and having fun.  He was always my favorite Scorpion, and since it has been over 20 years, and nothing has been proven in court, perhaps there is no there, there. At any rate, this was a top notch concert and a top notch DVD.  The camera work was great.  Now everyone can see Michael's solos, up close and personal.  He is phenomenal.  And he plays 99.99% using only 3 fingers. He can do more with 3 fingers than other guitarists will ever do with 4.  The solo for Rock Bottom, as always, was jaw dropping.  The camera work made me feel like I had a front row seat.  And of course, they even took a shot of the obligatory upside down Marshall amp. :-) Gotta love Michael's sense of humor.  If you are a Michael Schenker fan, or just a fan of hard rock, I highly recommend this DVD.  It is AMAZING!
B00CDV6WDS|1.0|I do not like how the game shows which tiles are free to be chosen (they are brighter), as it defeats the challenge of the game. Boring.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is a great game for all ages! It's a nice game to have just to pass the time and breed your own diverse group of dragons! Come and join the fun! XOXOXOXOXOXOXO
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I am a big bingo fan and I have to admit this has got to be my favorite one! The only thing is I wish it was easier to earn the credits, but then I would never stop playing! Beware of the beggars! Every room has people begging for items, I don't think they even play the game.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|I don't think facebook should be forced upon players in order to enjoy this game. I don't have a facebook account and I don't play games that will only connect through facebook. XOXOXO
B009NY43NY|4.0|I don't see what so many people have against this book.  I honestly believe it much better than the last two in the series. I am satisfied with the ending and would definitely recommend it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I I just finished rereading this book, and I still ended up crying at the end of it, honestly this book is my favorite out of the whole trilogy.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Good graphics and easy learning curve. Gets a little hard in the later levels but you just have to keep playing for points to get upgrades, unless you of coarse pay for them.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|As always Nicholas Sparks captures your full attention to the end. I highly recommend this book. Great vacation book to purchase.
B008B8AOQI|5.0|Purchased this for my daughters birthday as she requested it , and could only find it on AMOZON. She saw passenger at a ED SHEERAN concert and was a fan immediately , loves the cd x
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I love this app! It is a must have for any MTG fan. It has a lot of content stuff to unlock and then there is the multiplayer ALL on the go!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I am addicted to moving through quickly and hate it when I can't buy a treasure chest.  I have spent myself into a hole with this app for sure.  I play at least twice a day if not more.  I love the graphics and my grandson loves seeing the fish and poking old bloaty and I got it for him but he can't poke the things fast enoiugh to collect for me , so I collect and then turn him loose.  He is not quite 2 but loves Nemo so he finds the animations and graphics fascinating.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Good read but maybe a little too feministic at the end.  Definitely taught me the value of turning the blackberry and computer off every now and then to gain the respect of the people you work with (if in the right setting).
B000YJ54DU|5.0|I really do not understand why so many people did not like this book.  This was the sixteenth book of the Reacher series that I have read and I thought it was one of his best.  The plot was complex, kept me guessing, and the ending was a shocker.
0812973992|5.0|Everyone must read this book as it is tied to a great historical event and the characters interweave together in a great manner.
0345803485|1.0|I happen to enjoy erotic novels, and I am a BDSM fan. This book is TRASH. No character development whatsoever, this book is literally exactly like a porn movie, where you meet the characters, and just as you get their names down they are having sex. The only people I have seen enjoy this book are vanilla women/couples and girls with no sex life. Allow me to break it down:<br />-This sounds like it is written by high school girls. Very very boring and repetitive language, awful sex that is very comparable to \\"amateur porn\\". No really, who orgasms 3 times just by touching?<br />- You hear about lip biting, blushing, \\"7338 shades of this and that\\", \\"holy cow/crap/f****/etc.\\" and \\"jeez\\" more than absolutely anything. Remove every one of these phrases and words, and you have a bunch of linking verbs with a few names mixed in. Extra boring and beyond repetitive.<br />- The lack in character development is dreadful. We have no idea who Ana is or what she is doing in life, it is literally \\"here is a college girl who happens to be a virgin and gets her brains screwed out by a billionaire whose very personality makes no sense and the author failed to make this guy mysterious or sexy and he is 26 and never works but is somehow magically a billionaire.\\" This book never really goes into the characters, so they feel very two dimensional, boring, and- just like a crappy porn video- just hanging around for sex.<br />- I am sure a lot of people read this for the sex. Let me tell you, unless you are a virgin or have never ventured outside of Missionary, the sex in this is laughable, unbelievably corny, totally stupid. This girl creams when Grey looks at her, orgasms from a touch, and then orgasms four more times when they go beyond touching. Oh yes, let's not forget Grey's multiple orgasms as well, you would think the guy was also a virgin. There is no real storyline, random events, very jumpy, as if the author just wanted to get the characters into a good setting to have their embarrassing sex.<br /> I got to chapter 5 and was already complaining and hating it, but I pressed on. I refuse to read the other books, this was a complete waste of time and I have never felt so annoyed with something I have read before. I was hoping for a well written book that included various degrees of the BDSM lifestyle, along with a captivating story, and what I got was the stereotypical views on BDSM mixed in with cardboard people and a low quality amateur porn. Trash. Trash. Trash. Embarrassed for anyone who has read this book many times or thinks this is an excellent book.
B00CUWWLWG|1.0|The game was so fun!!! I played whenever I could and when I had Wi-Fi and it was one of the best apps I had ever gotten and I had gotten all the warrior clans you could and my kingdom was huge and one day I exited the game like any other time I had and tried to log back in later and it didn't load. I tried every thing to get it to work again and even risked losing all my stuff by delegating it and reloading it but it still didn't work after that either. I'M SO SAD!!!!!!!!!!! I MISS MY GAME!!!!!!! I wish I knew what was wrong or that someone would tell me so at least I knew why it wasn't working.
B00D56GCNU|5.0|Smart, tight, fast, unpredictable, intense - there are simply too many descriptives that apply. Orphan Black is a timely science fiction series that is a \\"need to watch\\" for everyone interested in the questions that arise about cloning and modern practice of corporate science -- or if you like twisty dramas. The cast is outstanding, but Tatiana Maslany really shines; I predict she will go far. Watch this!
B0040YFR1Y|5.0|Love this movie and on blue ray it is even better, They didn't do a great job with the blue ray conversion, but it works.
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|Cole never fails to surprise me with his work ethic, which is reflected in each song in this album. Cole World...
B009VA1FN6|5.0|I really loved this story and the way it was written. I followed the characters with interest and could picture the story unfolding in my mind as I read. Great description of the characters I felt they were real and I was drawn into the plot.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I would recommend this to any 50 Shades fans.  A quick read with juicy plot lines that keep you engaged and wanting a lover like Cross!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Great game, to play an I looooovvvve it. I hope that others would love it too. Have lots of fun .....
B007FG9LIE|4.0|This was my first Blake Crouch book.  It started out really good and I just wanted to keep reading and reading to try and figure out what the heck was going on.  It was strange and good indeed.<br /><br />A little over half way through the book, it started to get a little tedious and I just wanted to find out what was going on and why and get it finished.  I wasn't pleased with the ending.  I was expecting something more but it was good.  I will read more by this author because the beginning was just so good.  I just wish it had held up through out the whole book.  I am giving it 4 stars even though I didn't like the end.
B0087HT36U|4.0|awesome game! thx! always great to find a game that both parent and child approve of! thank you! that is a compliment for sure! love! love!
B002BU0DPE|4.0|This was my first gaming headset.  Overall I was pleased by the quality.  The 12ft of cable is very nice for sitting where you want with a console, but becomes quite a mess when using them with a pc.  The sliders allow for the perfect setting of chat and game volume, but the chat boast can occasionally make it sound like everyone in your party or game is yelling as load as they can.  It lasted well for a year of fairly heavy use before the sound cut out in the right ear phone and then a month or two later the left ear phone started to cut out.  So for 60 dollars I got many many hours of high quality game and chat sound and can still use it as a mic somehow.
B00B8PRDHE|4.0|Good keepsake if you attended this concert.  Very good all-starr band choices.  Steve Lukather is awesome as always.  Group really jels together.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|Most of the time you play with others... Ok. Correction ALL the TIME you PLAY with OTHERS! AH! I don't like this ... I don't like this at all I want solo game options in my games at least... Or just one-player ... that's A-OK... Not everything HASTOBE MMO!!! No, it doesn't hastobe. Ok!?!?!?!? OKAY!?!?!?!?
B0095MVOMC|1.0|I really enjoy strategy type games, and that includes puzzle games as well. Unfortunately, there is something present in the script that is setting off the alarms that there is a virus associated with this game. So this is not something that I care to play on my phone or KF, just as a precaution even though I do not keep sensitive info on it. Also, space is an issue and at almost 27 mb, that is quite a lot.
B00992CF6W|2.0|It's like digital lego-mimicing building blocks. I am not three years old. And well if I was I am not sure I would like this game ... It is weird. If I wanted to build with building blocks...<br /><br />Why is it called Minecraft.... Is it to capitalize off of the World of WarCRAFT and StarCraft and KRAFTcheese ... ok... :) That was lame... I know.<br /><br />So, for now... I am anti-MineCraft... but that could change I suppose within the next month or so, depending on how my life-events go and my puzzle/gaming needs turn. I don't know though.<br /><br />This one confuses me and puzzles me... So I guess it does it's job but not in a me-likey, enjoyable kind of way... if you know what I mean....

B0055SWM08|5.0|THIS GAME ROCKS!!!!<br />I am so impressed... it's like braid meets PORTAL. It's amazing... It's so simple yet BOGGLES my mind. IT's Everything I could EVEr ask for in a GAMe!!!!! I love it. I absolutely love this game.<br /><br />And well I haven't gone back to play it in a while but when I do.. I am so going to beat the level that i'm stumped on. :)
B00846REIS|4.0|Thought this was a good book. I am very glad that it was not just like 50 Shades. Eva is a strong character. I'd recommend this book.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Mahjong is Mahjong ... Though the Live Action Table Version is SOOOO VERY DIFFERENT, don't you know? Huh? You don't... Oh, Well you see... It is. Picture Rummy with Tiles and MahJong pictures on them and you need to get matches and you play with other people and it's like not matching tiles like this game or other digital versions of the game. So, yeah.<br />This isn't that good of a review... yet.<br />Well it's pretty the game design, the graphics... Nice....:)
B008XG1X18|5.0|I enjoy being able to grab and save all in one place and then to have to handy at whim.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|I've been a Final Fantasy fan since I bought the first game cartridge for my Nintendo when I was a teenager.  Getting this for my Kindle Fire was fantastic!  The gameplay is very smooth on my device and I've been having a blast.  Once it's downloaded, you don't need an internet connection to play so it's been a great filler when I'm away from any wi-fi connections.
1400064287|3.0|+<br />I really enjoyed the main points of the book - easy to remember principles, combined into the SUCCES acronym. I also enjoyed the stories supporting the points the authors were trying to make.<br />-<br />However, reading the book made me feel as if I was a kid and things had to be repeated for me, because I couldn't possibly get it the first time, could I? The clinics, written to demonstrate how to make messages stickier, felt a bit forced to me, but I guess they at least made me think. The book could be easily 100 pages thinner, which would make each word count.<br />=<br />Anyway, it's a fast read, pretty entertaining and I'm sure I'll get back to the principles in the future when I'm putting together something I would like people to notice and remember.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I started out reading the books alongside watching the show on HBO but that's been broken a bit now with this one.  If you're also trying to do this, I want to warn you that season 3 of the show only covers about half of this book.  You'll have a lot of spoilers about season 4 if you read this one through but it's definitely worth it!  If you're a fan of both, I don't think you'll be disappointed at all by just going right through to the end.  In fact, I seriously doubt that I'm going to wait long before buying the next book.<br /><br />I've read a lot of fantasy novels and I find that most follow a pretty predictable formula.  George R.R. Martin definitely doesn't follow the usual formulas with his books.  Expect to be surprised frequently!  This isn't your typical fantasy novel but it's well worth it.  I'm a self-professed geek and love all things swords and sorcery.  These are just plain epic.  I expect that I'll keep reading as long as he keeps writing!
B00004R99F|5.0|This movie is a good one.  People my age who had younger siblings like I did all know the characters, the themes, and especially the songs of those venerable Disney animated films from the mid-80s (and before) through the mid-90s.  This one doesn't get it's due, though.  I think it's a little bit lighter and a little bit more &#34;fun&#34; than those other ones.  So maybe it doesn't invoke the same emotional response of those ones.  But for me, half of the appreciation of Disney movies was the music.  This one has a couple of songs by a sort of Michael Jackson-cum-boy band [review author winces at word choice] character &#34;Powerline&#34; (Tevin Campbell) that I can still sing word-for-word to this day.
B0095MVOMC|5.0|After finding out from Avast! that the ping was a false positive, I gave the app a try and am glad that I did.<br /><br />It was pleasant play on my Samsung Galaxy S4 and I'm sure it will be even better on my Fire HD.<br />Pictures are clear with numbers hidden various ways, shapes, and forms....some are hard enough to be challenging, but not to the point of frustrating and giving up.<br />NO ADS.....ADMOB OR ANY OTHERS SHOWED UP DURING THE 5 LEVELS I TESTED IT ON.<br /><br />The only thing that I would fix is the penalty that you get for random tapping. Most HOG will penalize you after 2 or 3 false hits....just in case you think that something IS a number. This game penalizes you 10 seconds on the FIRST TAP. So if you think something is a number, it had better be.....or you take a hit for it. What's even worse, is that I was penalized numerous times while moving the screen around and zooming in and out and that's really not a great thing. I was finally able to zoom and pan without activating a penalty, but a child might not have the dexterity to do this.<br />I found this to be the most frustrating part of the game and ended up closing the game because of the false penalties. I should be able to touch something at least ONCE that looks like a number without being penalized for random tapping.<br /><br />DEVS: PLEASE CONSIDER CHANGING THE PENALTY TO 1 OR 2 'GRACE TAPS' BEFORE THE PENALTY TAP!<br /><br />The ability to zoom and move the screen around is a huge plus....especially when using a smaller device such as a phone.<br /><br />Bottom line: Enjoyable play + the ability to zoom and pan = 5 stars. Over zealous penalties = -1 star, so it comes out to a solid 4<br />If the devs give a change the 'random tap' penalty, I would definitely rate this a full 5 stars.

B004VMUS9G|5.0|re:title has never failed for me yet - I think the options are great and the snooze feature comes in handy (you have to really be awake to find the dismiss {off} feature also my only suggestion I would make this round - for ex. in the corner so you still have ti be awake - instead of a tiny bar which is so difficult for fatter fingers to accommodate). A suggestion but not enough. to take a whole star off, maybe 1/2!  :)
1118109791|5.0|solid in-depth review book.  if you have the discipline to study on your own (you better if you plan to go to business school!) this book is all you need.  don't spend the hundreds or thousands on review courses.  I would recommend this to people confident in their test-taking abilities, if that is a weak-spot for you, then maybe a course is better.

B0010SKUYM|5.0|I hadn't read a fantasy book in years when I picked this one up. The characters, story, and writing style were all so good that I finished this book and began searching for more great fantasy books. Having read a lot of them this series is still my favorite.
0544139453|3.0|This misnamed book (the ideology espoused by the protagonist has nothing to do with Islam but rather appears to be a moderate form of socialism)  purports to describe the protagonist's gradual disillusionment with his lucrative job with an American business evaluation company and Western imperialism/capitalism in general. Unfortunately, someone looking for an understanding of Muslim or Pakistani antagonism to the United States will  find little guidance in this highly personalized account. The book mainly centers around the protagonist's relationship with a wealthy young American woman  who gives him no reason to resent the United States as the problems in their relationship seem driven mainly by her growing mental illness. In fact, his main gripe seems to be that his job involves facilitating the takeover of companies for the purpose of making them more profitable even at some personal cost to the employees of the companies. I have never heard such a complaint against the U.S. from any Muslim source outside of this book. Even his attacks on U.S. foreign policy seem rather pale. The book makes no mention of Israel and barely a passing reference to the invasion Afghanistan. The protagonist's only real foreign policy complaint is that the US seemed to be favoring India  in a threatened showdown with Pakistan  shortly after Pakistani terrorists attacked the Indian Parliament in 2001.  I suppose therefore the book has some value in highlighting the strong impact on Pakistani sentiments of this largely forgotten (in the U.S. at least) incident.<br /><br />Because I am personally acquainted with many Pakistani professionals in the United States and find them as a group to be as 100% committed to the free enterprise system as anyone I've met, I found the protagonist's willingness to give up a lucrative career simply because of the qualms that his work might lead to some layoffs or restructuring of the target companies to make them more narrowly focused on profit-making activities most implausible. Many of the Pakistanis that I know are indeed unhappy with and even angry at the United States . But the reasons primarily center around the US invasion of Afghanistan, Iraq, its support of Israel and ongoing drone warfare in northwest Pakistan. On the other hand, I've never met a Pakistani who didn't think making as much money as possible in any way possible wasn't a very good thing indeed. Therefore I found the Reluctant Fundamentalist misnamed, implausible, and unhelpful in understanding the source of Pakistani and/or Muslim resentment towards the United States.ivities most implausible.

B005ZHB84U|5.0|For reasons that I really do not recall I did not review Hans Zimmer's score for Guy Ritchie's wonderful \\"Sherlock Holmes:  A Game of Shadows.\\"  It was an unfortunate oversight that should be remedied especially in the wake of two lesser scores this summer.  The first, and obvious, point should be that this was a better film than those suggested here and that makes the work for a composer all the easier (although there have been many great scores for poor movies).  The second point is that doing sequels is always dangerous business, particularly when the original was very good, and that is clearly the case here.  Zimmer surprised (an understatement) with his music for \\"Sherlock Holmes,\\" in what was easily one of the two or three best scores of that year.  The follow-up did not disappoint; it proved again to be very original (save for the main Holmes/Watson theme, still used in resourceful ways), and extremely good both on the screen and on the soundtrack album.  Now to a couple of sticky points involving the use of classic material and musical homages:  this is how it should be done!!!  The use of Shubert and Mozart were integral parts of the film and Zimmer made sound use of them.  His tributes to Ennio Morricone were equally significant and just plain brilliant especially the extended use of \\"Two Mules for Sister Sarah.\\"  The Romani \\"variations\\" are fun and again are vital to the film.  The central theme is solid; it is foreboding, sinister and dramatic and works as the musical backbone of what is simply one of Zimmer's best scores, indeed it drives the action as well as the music.  There are also two sinister motifs often associated with  Professor James Moriarty and Moran that are quite striking at various moments  Both the film and the score exceeded expectations, and we hope that a third Holmes/Watson outing is afoot.  Nicely produced and packaged by WaterTower Music.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|I had a blast watching this again. I saw it the year it debuted, and like it a lot. All these years later, the movie not only holds up well, but I think I got even more entertainment from it. I saw more of the set and location details, and I knew more about the actors. Great movie.

1433288796|4.0|With the movie coming out in November, I wanted to find out more about Jordon's life and what lead him to become a crook. What I like about the book is that it is his voice, and he lays it out step by step. This is a long disc series, but you get to understand all the things that leads a smart young boy into becoming a con artist. There are parts that get a bit long, so you have to skip ahead, but his nicknames for the people involved and his emotional reaction to each event are pretty funny. I can't give it 5 stars, but if you want to feel what it's like to be in someone else's &#34;indicted&#34; shoes, this is pretty good.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I enjoy this game. especially when I breed a new dragon for my island. I have limited income though and am unable to expand my space anymore with out buying more gold. other wise it is fun. also when I updated I now have to feed my dragons a huge amount in order for them to grow.
B008JFUR10|5.0|The Short: Guillermo Del Toro directs the most entertaining big summer blockbuster in years, proving him further as a master of multiple genres. It's equal parts smart, well directed, unbelievably entertaining and incredibly gorgeous; all coming together to be a heart pounding intense thrill ride that is both vividly original and starkly refreshing as compared to the reboots, sequels and other big budget films of the summer. Pacific Rim proves that there is still plenty of fun to be had at the movies.<br /><br />9/10<br /><br />As far as big, dumb, loud summer blockbusters go there hasn't been a solid entry for a long, long time. \\"Transformers\\" is the obvious comparison here to Pacific Rim, so let's get this out of the way right quick. Transformers, while pretty, is often times a clunky, poorly paced, horribly written, and immature big summer blockbuster film. Characters were weak and laughable, action was cool but often times hard to follow and the inconsistent tone would have driven any film-goer for a loop.<br /><br />Now enter Pacific Rim, a bold and fresh big summer blockbuster with completely original ideas and technologies, a unique and beautiful visual style, all featuring a time tested conflict and original characters. A bold promise, for sure. But Del Toro and the team have strung together what is quite possibly the best summer blockbuster in years, hands down without question.<br /><br />What better aspect to talk about first than special effects? Oh man, are they absolutely splendid. The special effects are incredible, unreal at times. Jaegers are designed with intricate detail, glistening in the rain and snow and sleet that they fight in and are brought to life with incredible realism. Moments outside of the action are fantastic too, combining amazing sets and gorgeous backdrops to carry the neo-sci fi style throughout the film. The Kaiju are brought to life with ferocity and gruesome majesty; these big hulking meanies are awesome, ridiculously cool and fun to watch completely obliterate cities. Del Toro is known for his monsters, and Pacific Rim doesn't disappoint.  I especially love the Godzilla vibes I get from Pacific Rim.  The original, directed by Ishiro Honda, would be proud.<br /><br />One of the other high points is the incredible level of detail seen throughout the film. Every fight scene is sensory overload, with a huge amount of detail from realistic physics applied to building chunks, cars, and other structures that give a sort of tangible weight that is missing from most films of the same genre. The remarkable visuals, produced by Industrial Light and Magic (a sub-division of LucasFilm) has done the impossible: they have brought movie magic to the screen, drenched in class and style unseen in just about every single summer blockbuster for the past few years.<br /><br />And then there is the earth shattering, bone crushing, kaiju smashing action fight scenes. Multiple times did I yearn to jovially jump up and cheer during the fight scenes like a kid on Saturday morning watching goons getting beat up in a Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers episode (and that's the truth). It's like Rock'em Sock'em robots on an unheard of scale, and it's perfectly balanced and respectively exciting to watch.  I don't want to spoil anything, but the action scenes are just an absolute joy. An absolute, unadulterated, bring-out-your-inner-12-year-old JOY. And it proves that there can still be plenty of fun to be had in a gigantic summer blockbuster. And it simply never stops being a blast. Brining gigantic scale ideas to life is one thing, but putting that into motion, directing the action, the pacing, the character interaction so that it all combines into one incredible experience; Well, very rarely is that ever done well...and here Guillermo struts his expertise and brings the fictional world of Pacific Rim to life.<br /><br />But the action would fall flat and the pretty images would be filler if it weren't for a convincing human component and a little smarts, which Pacific Rim succeeds mostly to bring that dynamic to the screen. Is it convincing, well written, and well directed? I thought so, in that lovable cheesy summer B movie kind-of way.<br /><br />The story follows Raleigh Beckett, a former Jaeger pilot out of luck after a major accident involving the kaiju. After some time to see how the other side works and lives, he's brought back to the jaeger team Gypsy Danger for one last crack attempt at stopping the Kaiju. The leading performances here are pretty good, most notably Idris Elba. His performance is strong, one that you can care for and is well written and acted. The rest of the cast, while there aren't any big name stars, is commendable on its diversity (one message that drives forward Pacific Rim), lovable cheesiness and well-acted script. You can feel Guillermo's signature character writing style in every one. Despite how minor, they have a shining moment or two (and a laugh here and there!) Charlie Day (It's Always Sunny in Philly) plays a hilarious comedic relief role but ends up being very important to the crux of the conflict. Charlie Hunnam (Sons of Anarchy) does a swell job as the hero and Rinko Kikuichi (Babel, Sideways) is surprisingly strong and well acted as the heroine of the story. Plus, Ron Perlman plays a kaiju black market dealer and is hilarious; a caricature of modern businessmen. And Ellen McLain (Glados of the Portal Series) acts as the Jaeger AI and has a few portal jokes for fans.<br /><br />The characters are written fairly broadly with a slightly cheesy edge, and are probably introduced too quickly. But that's just the fun of Pacific Rim. It's a well-paced film that never slows down, so the multiple characters keep you on your toes instead of simply just letting your brain go on cruise. There really isn't any baggage or extra fat; the film is trimmed fairly close to perfection so that every scene is important to the story and character growth.<br /><br />The rest of the elements that make up Pacific Rim are strong too. Ramin Djawadi's epic score is equal parts bombastic and musically memorable. What's cool is that Ramin's score matches up with the action at most points, so major brass drops and orchestra hits line up with the massive smashing punches of the Jaeger vs. Kaiju fights, further producing a cool and very Hanz- Zimmer-y effect. The sound design for the film is top notch too. Sure, it's loud, but there is a method to the madness. Every smash, crash, and subtle movement is in the mix. Dialogue is strong too, and you never have to strain to hear the humans inside the Jaegers. It's a subtle layer that most moviegoers don't even notice, but I greatly appreciate...because it's kind of hard to care about your characters when you can't hear them!<br /><br />Oh, and a side note. You have to experience this film at least once in IMAX 3D. The sound is incredible, and the bigger screen really brings the conflict to life. But the major attraction, and one of Pacific Rim's biggest accomplishments, is the incredible 3D. This just isn't a foreground and background effect, post processing 3D aftermarket scam. Next to James Cameron's Avatar, Pacific Rim is the best use of 3D I've seen yet. There is a huge amount of depth, and the level of detail is only more apparent when viewing in 3D. I'm sure that most who've seen it will agree, the IMAX 3D experience is a must see!<br /><br />Is there anything inherently wrong with Pacific Rim? Well, personally, I would've loved to have seen just one more epic fight scene stuck somewhere in the film. But that extra baggage could've pushed the film to the near 3 hour mark. Beggars can't be choosers, I guess! Like I stated before, the characters are a little broadly drawn but it's a more than excusable flaw when the special effects start flooding in.<br /><br />As I'm flipping through notes and playing the movie back in my head, I can't say that there wasn't a moment where I wasn't entertained. Sure, it's a relatively simple plot, but the level of fun I had in this big monster smash-hit overshadowed any nit-picks I had with the film. It's pure unadulterated entertainment from start to finish, and I wouldn't have Pacific Rim any other way.<br /><br />9/10 - Golden Summer Awardbr />The rest of the elements that make up Pacific Rim are strong too.

B00AKKTDJY|3.0|I loved the wide variety of menu options this offered but was unfortunately too slow much of the time because of not having figured out how to cook/process the options. It will take me some time to get up to speed on this one.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its the second best thing to owning your own horse or horses you can do everything in this game that you can do at a actual stable.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Loved it. My only regret was that I did not get it in DVD form so that I could look at it on a big screen. I guess I could have, if I had the proper connections. Anyway, I totally liked the story line, with the predictably adorable orphans, and the one and two-eyed minions. What a delightful experience!
0060930349|5.0|Paul Johnson looks at both the good and the bad and leaves it up to the reader to decide which outweighs the other.  He has not selected bits and pieces to fit a preconceived agenda.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I won't bother with the details of what they got right,  plenty others have done that quite well.<br />Editing to remove issue I thought existed in not being able to turn off highlighting.. it can be turned off. However *off* should be the default ... not the other way around. I am enjoying the game and it's better than many others of this style.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|Best show out now.. Surprisingly graphic for network.. Hannibal is great and all characters are upper echelon..  Best out to take over where dexter will be finishing off...
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|this is a really cute game I cant get over it.Now its like my 100th time on this game.I'm never gonna delete this game!Tots cute and fun.Those are 2 words 2 describe this game!!! :)
B00B9HTK1S|5.0|This book was a fantastic read. It kept me page-turning and was exciting at the same time! Great mystery story which kept you thinking about the conclusion. 5/5
B00969PR18|2.0|Clemson, SC.  Not located properly in relation to Lake Hartley.  Got the geography all out of wack.<br />Would get lost if I depended on this.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Great, high-budget twenty-five year anniversary production, if you like this musical. Includes a reunion of sorts at the end of the show with previous cast members singing parts of songs along with current ones, and some short speeches by writers, etc. after.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I've been hoping each book will be better but sadly not. All these books are is sex and screwed up people. There is no relationship between Eva and Gideon is sex. And honestly the author needs to find a better vocabulary because count and cleft got real old reading on every other page
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Why would you fix something that is not broken?  This app is awful. A jumbled mess. Huge battery sucker. No thank you. Going to weather bug. Fire this development team, they blew it.
0345529057|5.0|This is by far one of the most entertaining stories I have read in years! George R.R. Martin has done a fantastic job making his fantasy come to life for the reader. The characters are beautifully written and the book has a great plot line. These books do contain sex and violence so they aren't for everyone! If you are a fan, I would recommend reading the series before watching the show! Both are awesome!
B000AY74OG|5.0|good movie
B000JMKQX0|2.0|I'm a huge zombie fan! And as a zombie fan i was expecting to read an actual story and not a bunch of inter related short excerts.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is so intense and so much fun!  I let my kids help me with this game!  Tricky! It's Hard to put down!
B0063IH60K|5.0|The game is pretty good. I haven't had any problems with it at all. Well worth the download I think you will enjoy it also.
B0053O89U6|5.0|Loved everything about this season! I basically watched seasons 1-3 in about a week!!! I can't even say this one is better that all the rest because all the seasons are hysterical!
B00AMBK6J2|2.0|I kind of expected Ted to be crude, but it surprised even me.  There were a couple of chuckles, but the novelty of the talking teddy bear wore off quickly and the humor was too shallow to sustain my interest so I didn't even finish the film.  Ted's voice is *exactly* the voice of Peter Griffin, too, which was more distracting and annoying than comical.
B0058RN85O|5.0|Loved everything about this season! I basically watched seasons 1-3 in about a week!!! I can't even say this one is better that all the rest because all the seasons are hysterical!
B002G1YPH0|4.0|The installation instructions are not very detailed so it takes a little creative thinking to get past a couple of parts.  I had no idea how much tension to put on the screws, either, but it seems like I guess right!<br /><br />This was not a new build but a replacement for a noisy/sub-par stock cooling system from AMD.  I had to remove my MB to attach the mounting plate, and that part wasn't a lot of fun.  It is also a VERY tight fit in my mid-tower case - i definitely suggest measuring your case before committing to this project.<br /><br />Two weeks later, I'm happy with it.  It's quiet and vastly superior to the old, stock cooling system that I replaced with it.  Phenom X6 is stable at 47c with full CPU load (via prime95) and there is no increase in fan noise at all.  Works great!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Tragic and extremely interesting about how slaves and wives where treated.  Shocking what men could inflict upon their wives and slaves. Very well written
B0095MVOMC|1.0|Avast also complains about a virus in the package.  I would recommend not to install this.<br />Please keep your appstore clean Amazon!!
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is great and is completely additive a must play game. Its worth your free time maybe not your money but time.
B00AWJYJVA|5.0|A good portrayal of British administration at work, LeCarre is a master at this.He manages to capture all the nuances in detail.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|Comparing is unnecessary, specially when you are talking about a diverse and surprising band as QOTSA. There is no need to mention \\"songs for the deaf\\" or any previous album, because this album is definitely somewhere else in the universe of music. Homme and friends might recreate old places from past records, but from the very first song you get the feeling that Homme wants you to be surprised.<br /><br />If you know what QOTSA are all about, then you shouldn't be worried about their 6th studio album; its already a classic. Homme continues to deliver growth and sense every album, and its even better if you allow friends like Grohl and Reznor to join you, among classic Mark lanegan voices and Elton John.<br /><br />Key easy tracks that can guide you into better surprises:<br /><br />i sat by the ocean, if i had a tail, smooth sailing
B000002VRZ|5.0|Fell in love with their music with the first few notes of \\"There Goes Another Love Song\\" and had to agree 100 % with a major review of the time that said The Outlaws sounded like the Eagles (also new at the time) wished they sounded. I feel the first two albums were their best, and those albums are well represented here. Lost track of them in the mire of crappy '70's music for awhile, then bought the \\"Ghost Rider\\" album. This CD has the songs I missed, as well as the album favorites I've missed by not buying the individual CD's to replace my LP's. Great transfer to disc as far as I'm concerned. If you get only  one CD by The Outlaws, buy this one, for sure. Green Grass and High Tides, forever!
B0091WNK8M|5.0|It never gets old.  I have always loved this movie and have seen it several times.  It does stand the test of time.  Once a goonie always a goonie. Yes.
B0090SI4LU|3.0|Maybe I had high expectations after reading the novel, so the movie was just ok. It was enjoyable to watch but I don't think I'll be watching it again for awhile.
B004SEUJK0|5.0|Quick transaction. Love this movie! So happy with all the special features. I thought the price was right as well.
B00A7YZ1KI|1.0|I feel so sad and angry that a series of books that I truly loved finished up this way!<br />To me it felt like the author got tired, lazy and bored and she transferred her tired old muted feelings to poor Sookie...as well as giving a HUGE middle finger and great big EffYou to all the readers who loved these books!<br /><br />The earlier books were such a joy...I would read them with a smile and a laugh and they were delightful. The last few books started to go down hill, but this final one was just truly appalling.<br />I'm really shocked that the publishers and editors allowed this drivel to be published.<br /><br />Instead of joy and pleasure, I found myself rolling my eyes and scoffing out loud and saying `What???` !<br />I started to write a great long list of things I found glaringly ridiculous and inconsistent about this last book, but have deleted the lot....just like I shall now sadly delete Sookie from my life.<br /><br />I have all the books and also audio versions of every book, and I have read and listened too them several times in the past. But unfortunately this last pitiful offering has tainted all that's gone before.<br />And I also, like a lot of others, will never ever again read another Charlaine Harris book.<br />Such a shame...
B009NY43NY|2.0|Technically, this is a good ending to a successful series. It was well written and covered the essentials.<br />That being said, I am terribly disappointed. Unlike others, I am not surprised. The light, delightful tales have grown steadily darker as the HBO series debuted and grew more and more successful. I am very happy for Ms. Harris' success and disappointed in her inability to stand her ground in defense of the nature of her characters we all grew to love.<br />The total change of a wonderful series fans love is nothing new for some authors. Charlaine Harris has joined Robert Jordan and Laurell K Hamilton as example of success changing the author's view of well established characters drastically.<br />I realize the characters are the creation of the author's imagination. I just hate to see the characters changed based on outside influences, i.e. the HBO writers, producers, and directors; the development of another series; or the rerelease of quasi-successful paperback books in hardback. Sookie and Anita didn't just change. They went in totally opposite directions.<br />This book is satisfying to those that found Sookie as a result of the HBO series. It is traumatically unsettling to those that followed the books from the first, falling in love with the characters as initially established. I hope Ms. Harris starts a new series soon. Her unguided imagination makes for delightful reading in her lighter series. I delayed reading this book because I knew where it was going.
B00AVFO41K|5.0|Enjoyable.  Lots of fun! Recommend.  I have been unable to get past level one of the easy aspect of the game.<br /><br />Would DL again and recommend to my friends!
0345529057|5.0|I got hooked on the Game of Thrones series due to the HBO series. Following the end of season 3 I decided I couldn't wait until next year to see what happens so I bought the books. They were in absolutely great condition and received them quickly.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I love this product. Great for reading or watching a movie. The rotating case is what makes the case so useful.
0385344228|4.0|It's kind of quirky and it moves with out being boring like so many other first person novels. It has some personal touches that make it humanly warm.
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|This movie is like a walk down memory lane. Seeing the images of the Iranian Embassy -as well as everything else associated with that time period - amazing.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|I love this game so much  that I want to die from it<br /><br />Pewnpie the Orange box toy<br /><br />Wwe the Orange box toy story<br />Pewnpie the rate at which<br />Wwe the Orange box toy<br />The only way to die
B00ABO573A|1.0|Keep the Lights On is an accurate portrayal of the sad state of relationships within the gay community. In addition, the movie highlights a number themes that many gay men in America can easily relate to: immediate gratification, infidelity, casual/anonymous sex, substance dependency, and emotional instability. The movie itself is an hour and 25 minutes longer than it should have been.  You learn nothing knew about Paul and Erik beyond the first 15 minutes of the film:  Erik loves Paul and Paul loves only himself, Paul and Erik both need therapy, though for different reasons, and no one but the audience seems to tire of Paul's histrionics and selfishness. The movie's central message? Love hurts. A perhaps unintended message of this movie? The gay community in America is an embarrassment and it  still has a great deal of maturing.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|It has a good story line.  It has different story lines all rolled in one.  The costumes and music are great.  &#34;A&#34; one mini series
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This game is awesome,spectacular and perfect. The first day I got it I was already on level 8<br /><br />-Julianna Rochelin
B0015DROBO|3.0|I liked this book. The only reason I do not rate it higher is because:<br />The name of the book does not lend to how graphic and disturbing parts of it are. And furthermore the violent and graphic portions start halfway through the book and then instead of going away (which briefly you believe it does), it increases and gets much more severe.<br /><br />The second star is for two parts: 1. many Swedish words without explanation or difficulty to understand. I've never had a problem with this in a book before, but the cultural and geographical references were regional specific it was difficult to follow as I have never been to Sweden. 2. I still don't understand much of the main characters' thoughts or feelings in regards to their personal lives.<br /><br />The main characters are likable and the mystery unfolding makes it a real guessing who did it (and what). Because of this, and the flowing writing style, I have not made up my mi d whether to read the next book.
B00CFA222M|5.0|Received it quick, quality dvd & convenient loved the movie. My son & I love & collect the movies with the twist on fairy tales. This one did a great job without going overboard so the whole family can enjoy. Thats nice to find these days
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have really enjoyed Flynn's books.  I purchased this one with a touch of sadness, knowing it would be the last book I would read that Flynn gave a life to.  I dived in and was not disappointed.  Flynn cut a book that could have happened for real.  The characters and story line were top notch.  As I came to the last 25 pages of the book, I had to know how it ended, however, my heart did not want to turn each page, knowing it was a final ending to many hours enjoying the works of Flynn.  It is hard to accept that this is the end.  The book ended as it should, but the life of Vince Flynn was cut far too short.
B005LAIH2M|5.0|Really happy w/ dvd's. Blue ray & dvd plus downloadable to stream! For price its a steal. Fast service. Watched it 2 days after it was on sale in stores got it so quick
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Love how he takes our world and shifts it a little bit to create something unique. Plus I always enjoy a story thru a child's eyes.
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|I had heard a lot of great things about it and it seemed like something I might enjoy but im really picky. This did not disappoint
B007ZGO7EM|1.0|this app is very hard to use and very stupid I do not like it all because it is very stupid
B00COHAUD4|5.0|Couldnt wait to see it and when I finally did I was so not disappointed at all with this movie
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved all 10 levels and can't wait for more!  Challenging enough to make you think, but not so difficult that you feel stupid.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Like this game. Founded my grandson playing this game and had to it.  I am in Paris now and looking forward to other cities.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|What a fun creative game!  It kept me entertained for hours and found myself waking up and couldn't wait to continue. Love it!  Worth the cost!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved it! It warmed my heart to see Charlie \\"participate\\" . Personally I think I've grown from reading this it was that amazing
B00D37UQ1K|5.0|This was a great movie.  I thought at first it would be as corny as Twilight.  I was wrong.  Very good story and great acting.
B000IZA9NU|4.0|I liked the movie. It wasn't my favorite Star Trek film but it contained enough imaginative elements to keep me watching.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I liked the movie although i watch all cruise movies because the man can act action, the story is good and fast and well rounded..
0307476073|3.0|I am late to this \\"party\\", but I just finished reading \\"Wild\\" for a book club. It would not, otherwise, have been a book I would've picked up to read. Before reading a book, I like to read reviews of it to decide whether or not I would be wasting my money. I thought I would be with this one. At the beginning of the book, I did not care for Cheryl. I thought she was self-absorbed, immature, and selfish. It bothered me that she threw Paul, her loving husband, away. She was promiscuous, an adulteress and quite frankly, I thought she wrote TMI at times. I, too, lost my mom when I was a young adult, but her death did not have the same impact. I could not relate to some of Cheryl's self-destructive responses to grief. I found myself cringing at the details of parts of the book, especially when I read about the horse. It bothered me that Cheryl glossed over her abortion--included the statement with the things that she had packed in her backpack. Somehow, that did not seem \\"real\\" to me--as if that \\"little thing\\" for which she was not ready was that insignificant. However, as I began to read more, Cheryl grew on me. I have done some hiking and backpacking myself and could relate to some of the novice experiences. I love hiking the mountains and really connected when reading those portions of the book. Cheryl did seem a changed person by the end. She did not seem to judge others as some extreme feminists do. Cheryl seemed to be a genuinely nice person. I found myself wanting to know more about when/how she decided to settle down and if she ever went hiking w/ her family on parts of the PCT.
B00C1GBOU6|5.0|This is slightly different to what I was expecting. I can go days and play nothing but Sigur Ros, so I am well defined as a big fan.<br />Mostly, I favor the achingly beautiful, almost dirge like songs (Andvari, Refur, Von, All Alright, Glosoli, Festival), but this CD surprised me.<br />It does have more of an edge, perhaps a bit more &#34;bite&#34; than most of their recent work.<br />Nevertheless, it only took me one listen to want to go back and play all the songs again.<br />Of course I would listen to this band if they put Wikipedia pages to music, so I may not be the most reliable source.<br />To me, Sigur Ros is a conduit to something much bigger than themselves.<br />I often feel their music was there when the Universe was created.<br />All fans: Buy this CD. New fans: explore the catalog. This is greatness.
B00000ITOY|5.0|We use this to help out toddler with fine motor skills.  Lightweight smaller pieces make gripping holding them easier so that he can concentrate on wrist rotation and hand eye coordination.  Unlike some sorting toys, this one is shorter so you do not have to feel as worried that the child may impale themselves like a kebab.
B00138F4OK|5.0|A good product I wouldn't be surprised if you got this album and wanted to go scream DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGOOOOOOOOOOOOO this album includes burning heart heart's on fire no easy way out training montage sweetest victory and more
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game and everything about it. you can groom your horse and clean it and it is just great. I wish you could do muck out and the other things with out having to be a certain level......
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is amazing game for kindle fire and the iPhone and iPod touch with an extra day of the minions and gru
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I finally downloaded this game and glad that I did. Relaxing yet challenging way to pass the time. It's like owning your own horse!
B005ZUR724|5.0|I love the game enough said. but GL has already given the new update to the apple users an nt android.  Also GL just is in it to make money nt to create a game with the all the all tht it can. e like we players know it can. PLZ GL GET OFF YOUR BUTTS AN DO SOMETHING RITE FOR A CHANGE.
B00280LYIC|5.0|You should read this book it's really good trust me I couldn't stop  reading it finished it in one day no joke
B009NQZVKG|5.0|For me, this book opened an incredible universe of scientific possibilities yet to be discovered. We here on earth are such a small part of a much, much greater creation that it's difficult but inexplicably exciting to imagine. I loved this book!!! If this author's books are all this imaginative in combination with historical facts, then I'm going to be reading all of his books!!
0307271080|5.0|I love this book, I finished reading it in a week despite my hectic schedule, I highly recommend especially for any immigrant, you will really relate to this book.
B008B4KVS8|4.0|Just watched last night and it reminded me why I like these old moves.  Good dialogue and chemistry between the actors.  Enough action without being over the top.
B001QW8QYS|5.0|great story, excellent action!!! It just was an all around excellent movie!  I just can't say enough  about it. and to top it off,  the actors  and actresses were top notch!  I'll watch it again and again, I'm sure!
B0081336FO|5.0|An exceptional modern interpretation of the classic novels. Just the right length. Wish there were more than 3 episodes per season but it works.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|love the game. My friends have a Kindle and a tablet and they always are looking for a app. The first thing I say is Temple run 2!
B002DOSBMK|5.0|I have had my go to worlds as an escape from reality for many years. I am so excited to have this now to add to the list. Thanks to my husband, a dedicated Salvatore fan, for introducing me to these amazing books.
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|Have been unable to download this game to my Droid Razor M.  Good thing it was a free one!!!  Have been unable to download.  What more do you want?
159463176X|5.0|From the author of &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns&#34; and &#34;The Kite Runner&#34;, Khaled Hosseini again produces a wonderful book that you won't want to put down.  This author's words paint another story that will stay with you long after you have finished the book. Definitely recommend this book.  Enjoy!
B00A3NQNUU|2.0|Tried to open the game but it says &quot;An error occured while downloading a required file&quot;. Happened before and I lost my game completely and had to start all over again.Please fix and I will rate 5 stars.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|Bruce Willis and another Die Hard movie?  Heck yes!  Like the previous Die Hard movies there is plenty of action and explosions, and is definitely not a disappointment.  I am so glad that we've added this movie to our collection, for we will certainly watch it again and again.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I love the music. I love the magical quality of Gregory Maguire in telling the &#34;back stories&#34; to classics. Go to the play. Listen to the music. Ponder the issues. Read Gregory Maguire's other books, including the four-part series, &#34;The Wicked Years.&#34; Get hooked and enjoy!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love playing this! Especially like the winning animation! I would recommend this game to anyone who likes a reliable winning card game!
B009O07NMA|5.0|I don't really listen to country, but after hearing the remix 'cruise' I had to hear the rest of the cd. It is great, perfect cd for the summer time.
B006IGZWB2|4.0|I read this book and loved it and was so happy to see how great the movie was as well!
0345533054|4.0|This is the first Harlan Coben book I've read & it has definitely encouraged me to keep reading his stuff. A great murder mystery/thriller.<br /><br />Will Klein's ex girlfriend Julie was killed 11 years ago. The accused was his brother Ken, who disappeared the same night as Julie's murder... Is his brother in fact the killer? Dead himself? Now Will's current girlfriend Sheila has gone missing. What's the connection?<br /><br />There's a lot going on but in a good way. I will be buying Coben's other books when I see them. His writing was a pleasure to read.
B00881VLCE|5.0|don't. no yet. just got the. update but so far it seems to. ok I will do another update later
B000TU16GS|5.0|So good it was so exciting and interesting I couldn't stop reading I think I'll read the rest of the series!!!!
B0054SMID0|5.0|Great movie!  My husband and I both enjoyed it.  It really kept you guessing.  Great cast too.  Hope there is a sequel!
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|A surprisingly good movie. Would recommend this movie -- good adventure while Cruise and Duvall do a great job, as usual acting and providing great entertainment.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Brilliant couldn't leave it down. Would recommend to friends. Would read another of Suzanne collins books in the future after I've finished with the one I've started.
B00006674X|5.0|it was one of the last elvis movies for my collection. have also collected various elvis products from bying newspapers.
B00BC5FN2C|5.0|Creative writing that keeps you wanting more. Incredibly accurate as to how politics work in Washington!  The best show NOT on television!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Well not sure of a but so 5 stars it is.  Only slight downfall is having to wait for more lives.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great fun for hours! Thanks for making it so life like. She loves having her very own horse! Great fun...no real mess.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Once the reader commits to the characters there is no turning back. You are carried on a wave that draws you in and consumes the senses. Great read.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|Red was a whole lotta mindless fun for me.  I could have enjoyed it on the basis of John Malkovich's performance alone but the beautiful Mary Louise-Parker was certainly no slouch, either.  She shows off her hilarious comedic skills as well.  Of course, Bruce Willis plays Bruce Willis to a tee as usual and that always works for me.  Thoroughly enjoyable, funny action film.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|If you like suspense, shocking events, and real characters this book is for you. The second I started reading the book I couldn't put it down. The author writes with an evident consideration of making a romance novel feel as though it's not another fluffy love story. This novel has depth to it unlike others who mainly focus on the physical nature of love, but Colleen presents how love can transcend the physical into something more. I highly recommended stocking up on snacks before you read because you won't ever want to stop reading:)
B00CDV6WDS|3.0|The free app of the day from the Amazon App Store for July 12, 2013 is All-in-One Mahjong from Pozirk Games.<br /><br />Mahjong games have been featured like at least a dozen times in the past as free apps of the day from Amazon since they started this free app of the day program back in the Spring of 2011.  Some were designed for a special occasion such as a certain holiday and one was even a kids version of the popular game.<br /><br />Before I decided to write this review, I had made up my mind that this is either a 3 or 4 star app, but definitely not a 5 star app.<br /><br />I decided to go with the 3 star rating because it just feels like it comes up a bit short as a 4 star app.<br /><br />Here is my explanation for the lower 3 star rating over the 4 star rating:<br /><br />The title of this app is rather misleading.  You cannot call something All-in-One Mahjong with absolutely no explanation to what the All-in-One refers to.  The only meaning of the \\"All-in-One\\" title that would seem to make sense is that every scoring system and geographical variation of this worldwide game is represented here which is clearly not the case at all.<br /><br />In fact, the same publisher has another paid app called All-in-One Solitaire which has a much more logical reason to be called All-in-One since it has several variations of Solitaire represented in their app.<br /><br />If it weren't for the rather misleading title, this game would have gotten a 4 star rating most likely.  It seems to be made for people used to the typical variation of Mahjong that you find in other US Mahjong video games.  I would have only deducted one star for the cluttered appearance of the main menu and the clutter of icons at the bottom of the screen when playing the game.  And a zooming feature found in some other Mahjong games would have been a nice addition too.<br /><br />So I am giving this 3 stars out of a possible 5 star rating.  I am almost certain this is not quite the best designed Mahjonggame app out there but is still almost 4 stars worthy.  If the title confusion, cluttered menu screen, and a lack of a zoom feature doesn't bother you like it did me, then this might be a worthy app to get.
159463176X|5.0|Having read his previous two books, I was extremely eager to get my hands on this one- and it certainly delivers. I love the way this one is structured- it seems to be a splintered story, but there is no doubt that each of those splinters come from the same tree.<br /><br />I like that Hosseini is challenging himself as a writer more and more with each subsequent novel. The narrative has the familiar poetic tone of his previous successes, but manages to convey nine especially unique new voices and characters.<br /><br />Although some voices seem to come more naturally for Hosseini than others, I think he's done a superb job with each of the pieces of this puzzle, creating a vivid and deep circumstance in each case. He's illustrated well the various different courses a life can take based on a choice which seems so indirect to it.
B0000024YL|5.0|What's not to like with this classic? Was great back then and is still a great cd. Yes, go ahead and add this to your music collection.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is a really good book. You should totally get this book. This series is awesome I can't wait to read more! :)
B00914JWSW|5.0|I bought this as a gift and the recipient loves this CD. Guess you can say it's another winner from Barbra.
B007ZRZF8I|3.0|Great little casual live action puzzle game.  Not something that would make it big as a competitive game, of course, but what do you expect from a single player side scroller?
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Battery HD is one of the best apps I have downloaded! I have it on my iPhone & now on my Kindle Fire HD!<br /><br />There's not a lot more that I can say about it to be honest. A simple app operating almost without notice.<br /><br />Thank you very much!!
B000YDAYK4|5.0|对于我的来说不大不小，价格合适，科技含量十足，真的很喜欢啊,  fit my size<br />and the price is reasonable so i am so happy to have it .i wll buy this brand again
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|would recommend for a time killer. it is fun to play. would be more fun if the controls worked a. bit better.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|It's so much fun, but depending  the difficulty you have it set at it can be pretty difficult to beat the computer.
B005BZQS1E|1.0|what is it with the penis jokes and the whole sucking thing... I guess if your immature it might be funny(by the way immaturity isn't defined by how old you are). If the jokes would have been funny it would have been a good movie.Ok not sure if that was helpful but it needed saying.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This app is fantastic for a lot of things. It's a calender, it's a checklist, and best of all a note pad. It can do other things to but these are the most useful. I use it all the time.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|although for me it is getting a little bit old at this point, it is still a excellently written show with great character building and a bit of uniqueness to each character... a show that still believes in right and wrong. could use a new character or two...somehting new to explore.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very fun if your a despicable me fan it's really addicting and one of the best games ever and awesome
B00CRMWMZ0|4.0|Cool techno-ish album by Daft Punk.  Sounds like they used a lot of disco beats for most of the songs, in most cases they're quite catchy and fun to listen to.  Like most techno music though there are one or two songs where they repeat the same line over and over and not in a good way, it's just annoying. All in all quite good though.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I like how it is fun and it doesn't get boring. And it's cute cause of the minions :) there's only a couple flaws but other than that it's great so I advise you to play.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I wish it was longer but other then that It was a great game! I completed it in like an hour I think..
B006C5FWH8|5.0|I have had the game less than a month and the developers have posted two updates.  These have improved playability, fixed minor problems, and incorporated player suggestions. Well worth the price as the game continues to improve.
B0001932ZA|5.0|arnold schwarzenegger is wrongly convicted of a crime & forced to partake in the running man game. he and his two friends fight off the warriors. maria conchita alonso is a wonderful addition to the story.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This book is a fun read for just about all ages. Gaiman is his usual creative genius. His imagination is what makes this such fun to read.
1400052181|4.0|Great book.  Lots of information I never knew.  Very well put together.  It kept me interested till the end.  Good summer read.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|I found this book to be great adventurous reading. The author kept you guessing through out the entire book. I highly recommend it.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Seems ok so far. It wants a rating I hope there are more levels, if there are it gets 4 stars. If there aren't a 2 star rating.
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|Those of us who grew up looking forward toand watching Wizard of Oz every time it aired can appreciate this movie and see the references to the original.<br />This movie explains how the wizard turned &#34;Great and Powerful&#34;<br />I appreciated that they showed how the witch of the west, who was a normal human innocent naive girl turned wicked.<br />The only thing that disappointed me was that I wanted to see the sisters striped white and red stockings and that was not shown here.<br />Nor was the tin man though they did give you the impression of where his origins came from.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|No comment at this time. Lets just say I like it.  I don't have any thing else to say about the book.
B003UYV08E|5.0|Grandkids favorite.  Good sequel to Iron Man I.  Good for all ages for action and adventure and good clean fun.
B001NHNG64|3.0|I have no comment at this time.  I will say that it was OK.  Nothing else to say at thi time.
B001KZG99A|5.0|Grandson's pick.  His favorite of Marvel comics.  Good for all ages  and genders for action and adventure and good clean fun.
B000GCFG7E|4.0|I am still reading this book.  At this time I have no comment to say. No comment at this time
B0033807E0|5.0|if you enjoyed the others in the series this is a must. Rick keeps the audience entranced and wanting more.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|MUCH more interesting and less frustrating than the usual escape games.<br />Kept me coming back for another look. More levels, please.
B0033806MI|3.0|not as good as the other books in the series , but interesting anecdotes and fun quotes re. Gods past and present
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|this was a wonderful film. maggie smith was  great as usual as well as the whole cast.  the story was perfect,and the egos of the once famous opera stars were amusing in their individual ways.
B0033807C2|5.0|if you enjoyed the others in the series this is a must. Rick keeps the audience entranced and wanting more.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A must read. Great from the start to the finish. I can't wait to reach the rest of the books that follow.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Well conceived story line with a surprise twist about midway through the book. The action really picks up and I couldn't help but keep turning the pages well into the night.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I love this app!!!!! It's super fun and its educational too. I did a project on deadly diseases. It gave me a chance to show how it spreads and everything. My friend and I love giving it funny names. and to all the people complaining about having to purchase other stuff you can unlock everything by playing it for a while. Overall a great app and complete AWESOMENINJANESS!!!!!!!!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I normally don't pay for an app, but after the trial period, I felt this was well worth the money.  I tried several to get the swipe feature and liked this the best.  Probably the accuracy of the word prediction, and its ability to learn, was what sold me.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|ilike it its really fun to play when i am board and on long car rides to some place far away
B004BLJQOK|5.0|I love the contrast between the lonely vampire girl looking for a companion and her vicious vampire attacks. ..The young actress (Chloe Grace Moretz) plays the part to perfection. ..This contrast is not highlited in the original (Let The Right One In).<br /><br />This is not another Twilight movie. ...This movie is SERIOUS and this vampire has been 12 years old for many years.  ..Not a mega budget hollywood production, but there is enough suspense, drama, violence, and special effects to keep you hooked. ..If you remember your first \\"crush\\", this movie will push your buttons.<br /><br />This movie improves on the original (\\"Let The Right One In\\"), primarily because Chloe Moretz is a more talented actress. ..Otherwise, there are only slight differences between the two movies.  ..The most unique and entertaining vampire movie I've seen.<br /><br />Minor Point: The only thing I didn't care for was when Chloe went into \\"vampire mode\\" she looked very much like Linda Blair in the Exorcist (really over the top). ..Blood shot eyes, pale white complexion, and fangs would have been more inline with the rest of this movie.
B004DK5CYM|5.0|Don't know if it is entirely historically accurate but very enjoyable. It is really nice because I was alive during the events depicted and can remember them as they happened. I even still have one of the original Newsweek magazines with Secretariat on the cover. So it was a pretty cool movie for me to watch,.
B0095MVOMC|1.0|After install my trust and go software scanner notified me that there was a risk to this program and recommended that I uninstall it imeadiatly. So I did. What I don't understand is how it was allowed to be on Amazon at all especially as faotd! Wow!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so awesome I wish there werebmore games like this one it is just like temple run and subway suffers and I give it a 5 star rating.
B003YNFYCO|4.0|I guess I just like older music. I AM 56 years old.  I don't consider rap to be music.  I hate it.
B00BYISQTO|5.0|When you get home and you feel like you are as tight as a drumhead emotionally......just play- what I call #mindpharma music from so many great indie bands! There has been a tremendous resurgence in what was once known as the 90's shoe gazer genre. It has evolved to the point where you can easily lose an hour or two IF you just close your eyes ....and relax your mind and body. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths.....then listen! And RELAX!  On twitter follow me and I will follow back ( @CU2MRO) as I and a bunch of others are all discovering new bands, s/s'rs, etc. ENJOY!!
B0091REZMW|5.0|This is a terrific hidden object game.  There are so many rooms to explore.  This is a thriller for sure!
0440246318|5.0|Jack Reacher is described by Lee Child as being like 6'4&#34;, 240lbs and a bruiser of a former military dude.....no offense but Cruise is like 5'8&#34; and soaking wet....maybe 160 to 170 lbs.......I do not think Lee Child 'greenlit' Mr. Cruise as his ideal role model of Jack Reacher....but hey, if they can make big guys look small in movies then I am sure they made Cruise 'look' the part and he is a good actor; let you know when I see it as I will wait til it hits the DirecTV dish as i haven't been to a movie theater since 1989-Glory!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really love this app!<br />I recommend it highly and the best part is - the app is FREE!<br />Great for two players!
B005O64VH8|5.0|I think I have every LP they ever did along with a boatload of Enya, David Lanz, etc., like I said, some days you just want a change and it is a sweet playlist!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I freaking love this and the minions and the movie this is the best I mean who doesn't love them the minions are so freaking cute
B00007FOMP|5.0|I bought the greatest hits CD and stumbled onto this CD of songs I had mostly not heard before......and listening to Marvin brings me back to the old days but this LP is unique.....a very pleasant surprise!!
B00BUADSMQ|4.0|It has a nice twist , good action what else would you expect from a die hard movie .  enjoy
B00CS7Z1W0|5.0|This is a driving LP.....it does have some nice songs inter-mixed w/ Leto's rock preferences. I have his other LP as well- both are nice in the rock play list!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Wonderful app. Does what it is supposed to do. Very easy to use and it's free. Who dosent like free
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|We just updated to the ice age park and have lost all park progress!  We were up to level 37.  The coins, food and money is still there but all dinos are gone :(  What a waste of time!!!!! Ugh!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|loved the app I wish I could play more levels<br />it looked kind of haunted but it was very easy
B00BGV0Y26|5.0|Grammy award winner Halestorm plays pure Hard Rock music that any Hard Rock fan will love! In this album they have the song Love Bites (But SO Do I) which one a Grammy for best Hard Rock / Metal performance song in 2013. This album is filled with great songs that Rock like I Miss The Misery which also top the music charts but also has some amazing Ballads like Here's To Us which was featured in an episode of Glee. Female front woman Lzzy Hale has an amazing, very powerful voice with a wide vocal range and her brother Arejay Hale is an amazing drummer that fills the songs with very good and unique beats and drum fills with a very intense kind of playing that's very evident when playing live. This is a very good record.
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|not a quick easy to follow flick. Strap on your thinking cap, be patient and pay attention. If you can do that, its a good movie with many interwoven stories stretching across vast amounts of time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My granddaughter and I both enjoy this game. I know you will too! It really helps with hand eye coordination.
B00C7DGRL4|5.0|Great cast, Great Plot and well put together. Will definitely be a new Halloween favorite. a bit edgy for the kiddies but the wife and I thoroughly enjoyed it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|wonderful game. I love it! very addicting and adorable. I can spend hours on this game without getting bored. great!
B00CL50KDY|2.0|Previews painted a different picture than the actual movie. Trailers made this out to be much funnier than it actually was. Would not recomend
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|In think it's dangerous because a boy asked if I wanted to join him in Facebook with him but I don't know him
B00CX1TPF0|4.0|Not to scary, and easy to follow. The CGI was enjoyable and the story was intriguing. Have already watched twice with the entire family.
0847830942|5.0|If you are familiar with Jan Heine's magazine, Bicycle Quarterly, you know what you are getting. This beautiful book showcases the best of the French Constructeurs and their most exemplary bicycles. Lots of surprising innovations, as well as a look into the history of cuclotouring and randonneuring. Be aware it only covers this range, and as such, the title may be a little misleading. It's the Golden Age of FRENCH bicycles.
B0065FIHYA|5.0|If you haven't seen it this movie but love comic books or like old narrated black and white classics, do yourself a long over due favor... BUY this movie. Don't rent.. BUY!!
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|I like how it teaches you bout the fish and their environment really wish they would give you more algae
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I enjoy this game. Instead of downloading a whole bunch of games, you can get it all in one for free!! There's nothing as great as this app.
B009MYARIK|4.0|What a fun and lighthearted summer read. I thoroughly enjoyed and it and am reading Remember Me now. I love the style and quick pace of Sophie's writing, which is perfect for me since I hate stories that drag on. I also absolutely adore all the British terms and slang too!  Kudos for Sophie Kinsella!!
B004SEUJ82|5.0|I could hardly put the book down, though it was so very sad.  Yet, history is history and we need to be sure it never happens again.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I hope there's more levels soon it was challenging and fun. Yahoo and fun for kindle fire and the rest of the world
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app it always works. It also is usually correct. This weather app also is so much better than some of the paid apps I have tried on my Kindle Fire HD. The weather channel app and the weather bug apps suck. They were always wrong and I had trouble getting them to update. Give this one a try IT WORKS.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A great story that keeps you guessing right up to the end.  It was very difficult to put down. Very well written.
0345803493|4.0|Interesting reading
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I recommend this fame for all ages its so cute I love the minions. I LOVE GAME!!! its awesome you will love it to.
0345803485|4.0|Good story for down time
B000E33W1W|4.0|My daughter was born in 1992. She likes a lot of &#34;nerdy&#34; things that happened before her time and really wanted this. It made her very happy to own it. We just watched it a couple of days ago and it was funnier than I remember.
0345803507|4.0|Good book
B006OE7XM4|5.0|Wow!  What a vocalist.  Every track is wonderful.  The actual casing is beautiful. Glad to have have such a strong but soft soulful sound from an up and coming artist.  excellent cd.  worth the price
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This is the best game I love it you would regret downloading it!!!!!!! DOWNLOAD NOW  love the game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Love it!!!
B008Y5OWO8|5.0|What is a masterpiece?<br /><br />That word gets used a lot to describe all kinds of things. Most of the claims for masterpieces are dubious at best. In my opinion, and the opinion of thousands of people who have watched Rashomon over the years, this film is a bona fide masterpiece. But even though thousands of people agree that this film is one of the very best ever made, does that mean that my opinion and the opinions of those thousands are true? No, it doesn't. We all are subjective humans prone to errors and biases, and \\"truth\\" is something that may be completely out of our grasp. Are we viewing truth or just a convincing illusion that everyone agrees on? This is one of the many questions that Rashomon poses.<br /><br />If we try to be as objective as we can and at least form criteria to judge this film a masterpiece, we could check off some of these questions as yes or no.<br /><br />Does this film really make you think? Yes. In fact, it forces you to think. After all, as the viewer, you're trying to figure out who murdered and raped somebody.<br /><br />Does this film have truly stunning cinematography and camerawork? Yes, some of the best ever. Especially for a film released in 1950.<br /><br />Does this film have incredible actors in it? Yes, Toshiro Mifune and Takashi Shimura are both in this film, two of the very best actors you'll come across.<br /><br />Is this film directed exceptionably? Yes, Akira Kurosawa. Enough said. This artist directed superb films like bees make honey.<br /><br />Does this film actually have an \\"Effect\\" named after it? Yes, it does. Not many movies can say that.<br /><br />Does this film continue to influence TV, movies, books, and even scientific research to this day? Yes, without a doubt. You've probably seen something or read something using Rashomon in some way, and you didn't know it.<br /><br />I'll give a brief synopsis. A murder and rape occur out in the woods. Someone is accused of committing both crimes, and a trial isheld. There are four \\"witnesses\\" who give their own accounts of what happened that day. The problem is that all of the accounts contradict each other in some way. Even after hearing the rape victim testify, you are not even convinced that a rape occurred because she says a lot of things that are self-serving and things already demonstrated to be false. What in the name of the Rashomon gate really happened? Which story is correct?<br /><br />The unreliability of eyewitness testimony is now something firmly documented by science, but at the time Kurosawa made this film, it wasn't. In fact, eyewitness testimony was once considered the bedrock of the justice system, something unassailable and key to proving or disproving a case. Now, of course, we know that an eyewitness account is vulnerable to all sorts of things, most of which can't be avoided. People can view the same event happen, and not one person's account of what happened will completely match another. And people can be made to \\"see\\" things happen that they didn't actually witness, a fact born out by current research as well. The fallibility of human perception is now beyond dispute. So how can we know the \\"truth\\"?<br /><br />As with all great art, this movie poses great questions that don't have easy answers, if there are any answers at all.<br /><br />Did you see what you think you saw? Is your memory of an event accurate? We'd like to think so, but it is itself a human bias to fool ourselves with comforting illusions to protect our own egos. At least being aware that our brains aren't all they are made out to be can at least help us on the road to truth.<br /><br />The Criterion Collection edition is great, lots of extras, interviews, etc. It's well worth the extra money.<br /><br />If \\"Ikiru\\" is Kurosawa's heart, then \\"Rashomon\\" is Kurosawa's brain. Both are must-sees. Don't miss either.
B004GYY714|5.0|Getting and using this is like taking a world wide tour.  I just love it.  When I feel sad and down, I simply tune in music from all over the world.<br /><br />In fact in my travels in the US and around the world I always try to purchase local music.  Then later I can recapture many happy memories from all over by simply listening.<br /><br />I truly recommend this to everyone even children.  As I sit here right now, I am listening to some lovely polka music on a channel broadcating from Germany. While I seat here in Glendale, California....dreaming of beer and suages.  I think I can almost taste the beer, and see the people dancing and having fun.<br /><br />Wundebar!  Just so wonderful!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|This is a great game but it is addictive. The one problem is it freezes up in the middle of the game. They will credit you back if you tell them. The game is like the real bingo.
B001F290E4|5.0|Soulful, moving, inspirational blast from the past. Play it often! recommend to anyone who appreciates lyrics and music with purpose and heartfelt messages.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Hours of fun but after update I experience a lot of lag and puzzle pieces aren't as responsive. Anyone else have this problem.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game so much! I am eleven and I like to sneak my kindle fire to bed and what game do I play the most? This game! I love it so much! Recommended for anybody that's bored most of the time.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|AWESOME!!  I used to play this game as a child and would play for hours...I just think we should have unlimited games...
B00BC24NT4|4.0|Usual stellar performance by Le Carre. Since the cold war he's had to select other targets. In this case its the incestuous relationship between private security contractors and the higher echelons of the British government.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is worth paying for but its free!!  A must for anyone who needs ideas and/or wants to share their creativey with others.  Great collaboration tool too!
B009Z59ZNE|5.0|This is one of the best political TV series ever -- maybe even better than the West Wing.  It is a darker story but it reveals some truths about politics.  Ian Richardson is brilliant in the leading role.  This version of House of Cards clearly outclasses the American one so don't miss it.
B000002AHM|5.0|I first heard this album in college and was hooked.  I wanted to preserve my vinyl copy, so I bought the CD for regular playing.  If you want to hear some of the best jazz/flamenco guitar performances by three of the masters, you will not be disappointed.  This is by far, one of the great classic albums of its genre.
B00CWV8TIU|2.0|I got a notice to rate this movie, and I almost didn't even remember watching it.  Maybe it's because I was tired or something, but I thought it was lame and boring and convoluted. (About as lame & boring as this review...)
B001EOOQEM|5.0|The first album with Dio as the lead singer replacing Ozzy was one of Sabbath's best albums to that point.  The title track is one of the best hard rocking songs of all time and the rest of the songs are not far behind.  Purists may not like it because it isn't Ozzy singing and doesn't really sound like Sabbath but in my humble opinion it achieves greatness because it wasn't Ozzy.  Sabbath went through a few line-up changes after parting with Ozzy and this is the best of all of them.  This wasn't that line-up's best offering but it's very close!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game. Not too hard but made you think. I would like to see an update.  For a free game it was pretty entertaining.
B006N0YWGY|5.0|I got this game on a lark because it was free, but it had become s favorite! I like that it I'd not just a race or driving game, but involves trading good as well. While luck plays a role, the is also am element of thought that goes into doing well. I highly recommend this game.
0061733199|4.0|Haven't had the time to read it through yet, but the few chapters I did read were quite informative. Mr Wiseman, (is that his real name or just a very good description of him?), not only guides you through the survival steps but helps you understand why you are doing what you are doing, if that makes any sence.<br /><br />I will update this handbook review when I am done, thats the reason for the 4 stars. Yes I am taking notes.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think I am going to have problems putting his down.  lots of fin even for someone who is not good at these type of games.  love these minions!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Hugh Jackman is the quintessential Jean Valjean.  I highly recommend this film for your personal library. You will cherish it forever!
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|I found this book to be very helpful in tipping me over the edge to being a believer. The experiments were fun and easy and sometimes shocking in a good way . I would recommend this book to anyone who has thought there has to be more to life than what we've been taught.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Fast paced, very entertaining, a new hero is born with Will Robie. I love David Baldacci's novels and this one does not disappoint.
B00AGOGOLE|2.0|It was good in the beginning then all of the sudden it just started to shut off whenever I pressed on camcorder
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|Love this album, not much more I can say. I still have a required eight more words - no, wait, make that none.
B00DU74U74|1.0|I didn't read the book, nor a fan of Stephanie Myers, but figured with all these great reviews, and with William Hurt in the cast, the movie would be at least ok. Wrong. It was one of the most stupid, sappiest movies I've ever seen. I suppose if you like dumb juvenile love stories with contradictions throughout the storyline, you might like it, because I can't imagine where these favorable reviews are coming from. I can't figure out why William Hurt agreed to play in it. I will say his character was the only decent acting/character in it, but then again, he didn't have to play a sappy, lovesick teen.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I can't even tell you how wonderful this show is--the storyline, the depth of the characters, the dry humor, and the twists and turns of the plot.  I watch it over and over and never tire of any of it.  I've even got my parents watching it!
B005LAII3A|5.0|ALLSOME MOVIE, LOVE THE ACTION AND THE SFY OF THE WHOLE MOVIE, MUCH BETTER THAN THE PAST ONE!! TWO THUMBS UP MY BEST MOVIE EVER BOUGHT!
B004LQI0HE|2.0|The plot was too clearly foreshadowed and unsurprising. Perhaps the source material was written well before the practice of black market organs became commonplace; now it comes as no shock.
B003PPDBQ2|2.0|Frustrating and contrived, the method the author used of telling this tale to the absent sister, the tale of recounting the story of the sister's absence to a lawyer was the most convoluted methodology. This meant the reader was required to think who is the 'you' mentioned in the text?  Is it the sister or is it the lawyer or is it you the reader?  Infuriating! Having endured this confusion, the plot was mediocre.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I recommend this app for all people who like games that sets a goal and is a never ending fun game!
B001GUXJQA|5.0|Bosch is not just an exciting character, he brings it constantly and is way beyond easy getting it...buy this now you will be thrilled that you have.
0525953728|5.0|What can I say, my husband read this book in two days. He really enjoyed. We usually donate our books, but this one is a keeper.
B00594XOZU|4.0|I really do love this app and use it 24/7 but all my friends with i phones and ipods have the new update and i keep waiting for it on my kindle but it wont come. Otherwise this is AMAZING:)
B004HD61KE|4.0|I found this book to be very exciting because of the way it brought past and present together and made you question everything you thought you knew about some of our nation's most beloved historic figures.  I would highly recommend this to anyone with a sense of adventure and a need to dig deeper into our nations early history. History is most often written by those who were victorious in the final outcome.
B001R60ESE|5.0|I chose it because Katharine  Mcphee was featured and I am a great fan of Chris Botti and his band
B006YC74E8|5.0|This app is working, doesn't freeze, awesome for cropping, has it's own folder for Kindle Fire, has undo, color, drawing, doodling, and probably even typing on pictures. If I could give this 10 stars if I could. If anyone out there ever does read this, I highly recommend you get it. You can crop out the main point of your screenshots, too. Generally awesome.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|FANTASTIC game, especially challenging and keeps you engaged. I would recommend this to friends. I can't believe it's free. Next I'll challenge friends.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book will raise awareness around the issue of inequality for women.  Before people misjudge this book, they should read it in its entirety.  Well done!  IT's time for women and men to have full choice!  A significant contribution to our democracy.
B002ZGW9GU|5.0|Fast shipment. As described...Thank you
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Soo much better than the movie!  I had a hard time putting it down!! Definitely answers a lot of questions the movie did not which helped it to make a lot more sense!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is fun so far. I love the graphics and sound effects and it keeps you engaged the whole time.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|The game was fun but too short. the graphics were well done. would be better at $.99 the initial download took a long time.
B001M4YZ90|2.0|I have not been able to watch the last half hour of this movie as something is wrong with the disc and won't play until the end.
B00C7O8MJ8|5.0|The soundtrack completely takes you through the emotional highs and lows, starting with the light-hearted Pranking the Natives- to the extremely sad Mind Meld. The entire film gets replayed in your mind listening to this, which I think is just great. The individual pieces of music stand quite well on their own: London Calling, Kronos Wortet (the percussive banging of metal is a great touch), Brigadoom, and the edit from the closing credits. The Mp3 album is good for the Conway dance track (not a fan of that genre of music-but it is really good). Sonically, the cd is much better- but I'm glad I have both.<br />Only complaint....give us a deluxe version to hear more--too short!!!
B00C061I3K|4.0|I enjoy listing to this, it reminds me of older music.  Get lucky is my fav track  I would buy again.
147674355X|5.0|\\"Life can't be divided into chapters...only minutes. The events of your life are all crammed together one minute right after the other without any time lapses or blank pages or chapter breaks...\\"<br /><br />Sky is a home-schooled teen who has been sheltered nearly her entire life. She knows she was adopted at a young age when her father gave her up after her mother died. Sky blames herself for this, even though she can't remember much before going to live with Karen.<br /><br />Sky still meets boys because of her best friend Six. She fools around in secret with her boy toy Grayson when he sneaks in through her bedroom window. The problem is, Sky feels nothing. No passion, no desire, no emotion...nothing. As a matter of fact, she stares at the ceiling waiting for him to be done handling her. She only stops him when he tries to go too far south on her body. She'd done the same with a few other boys, earning her a loose reputation in town.<br /><br />When she finally goes to public school for her senior year of high school, she's hoping to experience a new kind of life before she heads out into the wide world. After her first day, she stops for some groceries at the local store and meets the town bad boy, Holder. Holder has attitude, a temper, and will not stop looking at her.<br /><br />The relationship is hot and cold, depending on how Holder seems to feel for the day. Just when Sky FEELS, Holder gets cold again. For a long time. He seems to recover and can't stay away from her again. Sky is all too happy to have him.<br /><br />Their world comes crashing down when all is revealed and you don't know if they'll survive it. Karen's story holds zero truth. Holder was right all along and it explains his coldness in the beginning. What happens next is heart-wrenching and earth-shattering. Who survives is anyone's guess but no one will be immune to the impact of the devastation.<br /><br />Now go read it and then pick up \\"Losing Hope\\". I know I will!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very impressed with this well imagined new series. I've just finished Wool and have begun reading the shift omnibus which promises to answer some questions about the evolution leading to the silos. To Hugh Howey, fine work, keep it up. The silo series will become a classic.
0345803493|5.0|the first book was great and this was just as good, now i can't wait to get my hands on number three
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|Nesbo keeps you bouncing. One minute you can't help but like Harry. The next minute you want to write the bum off. This is good mystery fiction!
0345803507|5.0|well after reading the first two books you have to see what happens next and this was no letdown you have to read this one as well
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This used to be my go-to app. No longer. The latest update took away all radar functionality and I have to reboot my kindle nearly every time I open the app. I'm going to find something else.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Dull at times, but an interesting perspective. Not a great read but worth the one time if you can't find anything else
B000ID37RM|5.0|I am identified as an African American but I am way beyond that scope, attachment and lable. What struct me so profoundly was the raw footage in the film, the not so nice and quite Actors on the scence, The Hatered, The Ignorance, The Innocence,  The realities of Life and the Sutility and blantness of death.Very graping and powerful, well made in so many ways. The family unit, the extended family, the dysfunctional family, the good and bad neighbor mix and the pressing points of idealism and the path of doing what's in your power to do.That Scout burst on almsot every scence, in her wonder and take on the world and good ole Jem, following in  the shadow of Actticu, courageous, bold, pushing the edge, defining acts and choices, a Mavrick of sorts. The film is a classic and stirs the emotional and deeper side of where where we are as nation still fall short, things can be much better, if we view things like a child with guidance, we won't continue killing mocking birds.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|this game is soo addicting! (: ive only had it for an hr. but sometimes the tutorial will freeze my kindle :-/ but all in all-Amazing!!!
B009NOVCTM|5.0|In 1964 I was a sophomore in high school, my 1st Stones album was \\"High Tides and Green Grass\\", which had \\"Satisfaction\\" on it. Then in 1966, I pledge ATO fraternity and \\"Satisfaction\\" was playing on the juke box. You younger folks might not remember the juke box, it was the way we got to be our own disc jockey. This three CD set gives you the best of the years from 1962 until today. But, I still love those old tunes the most, well up until the '80's. I stopped listening and this album has caught me up on what I was missing, \\"The Greatest Rock n Roll Band in the World\\".  If you're a Stones fan this is a 'must have' set.
B00A77II0U|5.0|the game was really cool maybe that's why it seemed so short to me. other than that a really good pick for the price.
B000002LFZ|5.0|This is the 2nd time I've bought this CD :) First one stayed at my EX's. Love Fleetwood Mac and had to have it again. Great to have for the vehicles as well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was really good better than the movie and I loved it so much! It was better than any other no book
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love this minion game!! its a big game to download so expect a second one after the first initial one. and its worth it!!
B0093Q8W0C|5.0|With brilliant music, acting, cinematography and suspense built into a first-rate screenplay, this movie never fails to please. I've seen it six times and counting.
0345529057|5.0|I was thrilled when I found that I could order the first 4 volumes together. I was not disappointed and have been reading for 2 weeks straight!  What entertainment!
141659521X|5.0|Vince is amazing!! One of my friends is a retired assistant director of the CIA....he says he doesn't understand how Vince can get these books passed by the censor because they are so accurate!! Just telling it like it is!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|the book was slow at first then I really was curious to know what happened to the girl. then I was hooked to find out what actually happened.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Its way better than the movie. I like how well written this book is and that it mainly focuses on Katness. But I don't like this perspective for the future. The capitol is full of idiots who enjoy watching gory deaths. I didn't absolutely hate this book, but I definitely disliked it.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I was drawn in the this new world. Loved the characters and plot twists. Can't wait to jump in to the third book!
030796664X|5.0|This was great insight into why we do some of the things we do, why it is difficult at times to change and how we can recognize why that is. It discusses the mindset to go forward and change our ways of thinking and our habits.  The stories of how the commercial market manipulates us by trending our habits and desires are well written and most all can identify with them.  The insight transcends across many planes.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I too have not paid a dime of &quot;real&quot; money. As of yet I have not needed &quot;friends&quot; but I will soon. Like the previous reviewer, I play until I run out of energy, sometimes only 5 minutes several times a day.  For me, this is not a game to get sucked into for hours. I didn't give 5 stars because it has a tendency to &quot;hang up&quot; and/or not load.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Boring, crude, depressing and totally uninteresting.  I can't believe people actually gave this piece of trash 5 stars.  Won't read any more of her novels.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Not too bad for a free game.  The levels start to make more sense the longer you play. I just wish there were more levels in the game.
159463176X|3.0|I am a huge fan of Hosseini's first two books, which stirred my emotions to no end.  So, when my wife gave me this book as a birthday present, I could not wait to read it.  Sadly this book did not measure up to my expectations.  The strong character development and the huge pull to turn the next page just wasn't there once I got through the beginning of the book.  I am disappointed, but it is my own fault.  My expectations were very high after reading \\"The Kite Runner\\" and \\"A Thousand Spendid Suns\\".  It seemed this novel was a rush job just to get it to market while the fans are thirsty for more.
B0050DZN4K|3.0|i really like this app as essentially a cross between flipboard and google reader.  i just hope the developers can work on stopping the app from crashing so much especially when it transitions between articles.  this may just be a kindle fire hd issue.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. The tiles are easy to see and there a lot of choices. I would recommend this app for anyone who likes strategy games.
B00BY7NK96|5.0|Sherpa Sandberg's TED talk and book have received a lot of attention, and this almost made me wary of reading it. I assumed it would be either trite or banal. I'm pleased to say I was utterly wrong. This is an insightful, data driven and impassioned manifesto for the woman in leadership, the working woman, the woman living to her fullest potential and ambition. I would not only recommend buying this book, I'd recommend buying a copy for the women in your life who need the encouragement to Lean In.
1582701709|5.0|I could not put it down, I read it twice. Will read again. The most interested reading in a long time
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Delightful thoughtful, Thought provoking book. Through the use of a very easy to read story we should all take the opportunity to look at ourselves in the big mirror that is our life's reflection and take time to absorb and evaluate where we are and why we are there. have a read and reflect. AND LIVE .
B004UQ03P2|5.0|How could anyway say anything bad about this. This thing is washable, bubble free and I can finally enjoy my laptop in the summer days. But before even going outside people, coming from a personal trainer you should really be careful with the glare on all high resolution products because it is truly putting a strain on your eyes. I hear someone say that this thing distorts the images lol, and I am sure they are the people with glasses looking for a screen protector. This thing will protect your eyes which is the most important effect of the matte finish. Which coming from someone who worked for apple from 2003-2006 we used to have way more option to taking custom orders to matte, now only a few. This is an eye thing, a health thing and longevity. I actually think the picture looks BETTER because I can really use the retina in my own eyes to focus on what I am doing. needless to say, typing this review :) I would never waist my time doing these things before. But Thanks to this Moshi iVisor Pro.....AWESOME,
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this game was fun and challenging. looking forward to new levels. didn't take too long to complete the levels. I like it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book has me hooked from the beginning. It made me laugh. It made me cry. It gave me how and totally ruined my night. This is what all books should do. I left my world for a few hundred pages and I entered the world of Charlie, an incredibly damaged teenager. His struggles with fitting in really take you back to highschool.
B00D37UQ1K|5.0|Not being a big fan of Stephanie Meyers Twilight saga I was a little hesitant at first to even read The Host. But I found the book to be really good and well written which was a surprise as Twilight was awful. When I heard they were making it into a movie I was excited and worried at the same time. Mainly because of the horrible job they did with Twilight. Again when I saw the preview I was even more concerned. I thought at first the actors they chose were not what I had pictured in my mind when reading the book especially the actor who was going to be playing Ian ( as he is my favorite character of course). But I can say that my concerns were not necessary. I really enjoyed this film. I thought all the acting was really good. They stuck as close to the book as possible for a movie. The book is rather long and for them to have everything from the book the movie would need to be at least 4 hours. But I think for a 2 hour movie they did really really well. This is definitely a movie I would recommend, buy and watch again. 2 thumbs up!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|this game is really good but it is also very slow when you wait to start your next run and it is a time killer
B007Y36K46|5.0|This movie was killed even before it was released. I remember waiting for it to be released and all the bed press about how horrible it was began to be splashed all over the news sites. The movie trailers and previews looked pretty good, but the professional reviewers and movie press killed it before it was even released. There was never even any advertising of this movie until just before its release, after that, all bad press. I decided to watch it after it came to video, but it has never been released to Amazon Prime, so I ended up having to buy it to watch it. I have been pleasantly surprised. The movie stays pretty close to Edgar Rice Burrows original story and flows pretty well. It is not disjointed or hard to follow a has been stated in the movie press. It's not constant excitement like \\"The Avengers\\" but it was not written that way, like a comic book. It is more like a short story in classic Edgar Rice Burroughs style. I have seen a couple of other tv movies that were based on this same story. This version is better than those. If you like Edgar Rice Burroughs style of story telling, you won't want to miss this one.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|The movie is set about sixty to seventy years in the future. The earth was attack. Those humanity survived. But the humanity and earth paid a heavy cost. The earth was damaged. And humanity had to leave earth for a colony on Titan. Only a handful people stayed to maintain the fusion machines to help there colony to survive. And a enmity which mystery wants to destroy the fusion machines. The movie as twists and turns in the film. Once you think you know what's happening. You known something wrong but you don't what until the end of the movie. To tell you too much. Will spoil the movie. Because it will keep you guessing!
B003Y5HWGI|5.0|i love this show its the best to bad it ended but it can never get old seeing it over and over
B001NKI60W|1.0|I like musicals, but I couldn't even finish watching this. Songs were catchy, but I couldn't wait for the movie to be over. I finally decided to stop making myself watch it and just stopped. Awful!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is the best game ever. I love the Meena battle and Vector battle. This game is full of Minion packed fun.<br />Go Minions
B0041KXA1Q|3.0|I love the movie, but I didn/t know it would be in Italian format. I can/t play it at all.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I was disappointed to learn that i couldnt acess without wifi, theirs no need for a bible if I cant read it when i want if i cant carry my bible with me, like work or just when i dont want to carry bulk. I will be removing
B005PR2FD8|5.0|This movie is the most best fighting movie I have seen in entire life. The other Tekken movie before this sucks. This Tekken blood vengeance meets my expectations. It was so great that I watched it twice.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Good puzzles, slightly challenging but not frustrating. I would greatly enjoy a sequel or an expansion of more rooms. Cheers on a job well done.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Good fast read.. love the telling of the story by a child.. gives it a different feel than other similar books
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Some of my other favorite shows:<br /><br />Doctor Who, Fringe, Star Trek, Burn Notice, NCIS, Mythbusters, & Lie to Me.<br /><br />I don't want to set your expectations too high, but I was hooked after one episode!
B00881VLCE|1.0|I loved this app until they recently updated it.  Now I can barely play the puzzles on my kindle fire because it is now so hard to move the pieces: the lag time for moving pieces is so great it is too irritating and awkward.  Too bad.  I guess I have to delete it.
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|This is a fun game. I would like to see an easier way to get money but it is pretty awesome especially the graphics.
B00DNO2LFC|5.0|It was outstanding in 93 and it is still a moving film. and you get to seeanna when she was 10 and starting out.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Just finished reading \\"Losing Hope\\" and realized that I never left a review for \\"Hopeless\\". So I really enjoyed reading this story. It was riveting. Sky endured so much as a young child but was unable to remember as a young adult until her childhood friend finds her. It's a great love story with a happy ending.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I have been playing this non stop since I downloaded it great fun game I recommend it for everyone even if you are not a fan of the movie
B00887490Y|2.0|To be honest I really didn't like this movie. I mean there was some twists but really it just confused me. There were things that I didn't even understand and I'm a big horror fanatic and usually understand things. I thought this movie had promising and look promising as well. I read that this movie was suppose to be based off of the Slenderman myth but when I watched it, it was nothing like Slenderman. The ending was what also confused me too. It didn't really tell why The Tall Man took the kids or what the purpose was of it. Overall I give this movie 3 stars. Directors should really plan on how they make movies and make sure that if they make a movie based a movie off of a myth, they should do it right and maybe get a bit of background history before they start filming.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I am choosing this rating because it was written in a language even I could understand, and considering the subject matter I felt a person would need a lot more education than I have and I have at least some college.<br /><br />I can't think of anything about this book that I did not like!<br /><br />I would recommend this or any book by Dan Brown, as I  am amazed by his mind and his writing abilities.  I really think this man has a fantastic mind.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I wish I could make my own person! Also it is sooooooo expensive! ! Everything costs gems!  Grr!! Other than that its fun!!:)
B005LAIHQS|5.0|I really like this movie and as it was the 3rd one you would think that the story line would drag but not in this case. Great job on this movie!
B005544TRQ|5.0|A terrific show detailing lives of workaholic lawyers winning cases and coping with different points of view. This show is full of lies, untold feelings and everyone trying to keep their own secrets under rapes.
B000Q67876|5.0|I love this movie and the book cover its so great! This was another of my gift and he is so please!<br />He already had the regulat version, so this is for a special collection!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I ordered this with my points and got it for free and the shipping was free and I got $2 worth of free movie credit!! How can you go wrong??
B007URVZJ6|5.0|The book is a concise how to get started in writing and formatting the manuscript.  Especially helpful are the precise steps to formatting your book in Word.<br /><br />This is a \\"must read\\" for first-time authors.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was fun to play and really made you think. However, the puzzles weren't so challenging that you couldn't figure them out with a bit of thinking. The biggest drawback was the lack of instructions about how to play. I basically just kept clicking around on the first level until things started making sense. So I was a bit frustrated to start but once I got the hang of it, it was super fun!
6305263248|5.0|I've seen the movie before so I bought a copy for my dad for his birthday .. he loved it !
B006KX3GXO|5.0|Love editing my pics with all the creative tools in this app!  Updates are great, never had a problem!  Thank you.
B00000JGHM|5.0|Another awesome movie I've seen before so I bought a copy for my dad for his birthday .. He loved it !!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved this game!  It's not like the other floor games that are impossible. You still get a challenge but know you will get to the next floor.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I tried to use this app and it took a half an hour to download! It is also very slow! You shouldn't get this it stinks!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I'm not much of a bookstore, but decided I wanted to read this book before I saw the movie. Although I was tempted many times to go ahead and rent the movie I'm glad I resisted! I loved the suspense and surprise ending. I've always loved the movies made about his books but now I'm a book lover too. Already bought my next Sparks novel.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses and I really enjoy this game. Can't wait to own a horse for real!<br />All ages will love it.
088708155X|2.0|Read the entire description before buying.  This hardcover is a mini book, but it is not clearly described as such.  The only well to tell (other than reading reviews) is to scroll down to find the product dimensions.  Most people probably will not notice.  We were very disappointed after receiving the book.  It is not an appropriate size for a 4 year old.
0312323867|4.0|I loved the first book in this duet, Something Borrowed (read my review here), and spent weeks on the library's waiting list for Something Blue.  I confess that the only reason I decided to read Something Blue was that I wanted more of Dex and Rachel, even if it was just a glimpse through Darcy's perspective.  I did not like Darcy in the first book and found myself rejoicing in her bad fortune.  I thought Darcy was a spoiled, selfish brat who deserved everything she got.  I know that's mean of me, but it's true.<br /><br />Because of these feelings, I did not have high expectations for Something Blue.  I read it only to get a sort of epilogue to Dex and Rachel's happily ever after.  And for the first hundred or so pages, seeing Dex and Rachel together was the only thing I liked about the book.  Darcy was being her usual spoiled self, and I was feeling absolutely no empathy for her.  But, then, something changed.  Darcy had an awakening of sorts, and started to grow up.  You know how much I like character growth, and Something Blue had it in spades.<br /><br />One thing I really liked about Something Borrowed was the way Giffin writes the dialogue, and Something Blue employed the same principle of not writing all of the dialogue out verbatim.  (Does someone know the technical term for this?)  This kind of writing made the book read quickly, and I just could not put either of these books down.  Something Blue has a very concrete ending, which I love, along with an epilogue where we get to see all of the characters one last time.  I loved the resolution to the story and was left feeling very satisfied with this two-book series.<br /><br />I would recommend Something Borrowed and Something Blue to fans of contemporary fiction and women's fiction.  They really were great reads!
006135323X|4.0|Dan Ariely takes the reader through a web of action and irrational reaction in this well written and easy to read work on why we behave irrationally in many of our actions.  He explores such topics as:<br /><br />* The value of free choice and volunteerism<br />* Procrastination<br />* Overvaluing our possessions<br />* Expectations effects<br />* Psychology of price<br />* Honesty in the workplace<br /><br />In all cases, Ariely is able to point out circumstances where irrational behavior is not only observed, but can be expected across a wide range of the (admittedly US centric) population.  The fascinating components of the studies provide us with insights into our own psychology and behavior.  Perhaps, even more importantly, it provides the reader with some semblance of understanding into the behavior of others as well as being able to modify their own behaviors and be aware of these largely self-defeating behaviors.<br /><br />The book is well read and researched, and anything that is readable and lifts the veil a bit on human behavior is worth reading.  This book fits that bill.
B0010SEMP0|4.0|I've seen plenty of people around the blogosphere talking about Bones and Chapter 32 but I didn't know what all that was about until I read One Foot in the Grave.  Now I get it...while I was prepared for the heavy-handedness of that particular bedroom scene I was not prepared for it to be enmeshed in such a good story.<br /><br />The Night Huntress series is toeing the line of  way too much  sexuality for me personally, but I think the plots are great and will keep reading for the cleverness of the writing.  Much like the Black Dagger Brotherhood, these books are not for the easily offended.<br /><br />Chapter 32 went too far.  I know I'm probably all alone in that thinking, but that's how I feel.  There was more emotion for me in the tenderness of Francine Rivers' Redeeming Love (some of the best Christian fiction ever written, in my opinion) than the extremely descriptive scene in chapter 32.<br /><br />It's funny that earlier today I was thinking of going back to the Anita Blake series---I stopped after Guilty Pleasures due to ghosts and zombie/corpse reanimating squeamishness---when at the end of this book we witness a corpse three months dead transformed into a ghoul (which seems awfully similar to a zombie to me).  If this continues I may be done in...<br /><br />Just One Gripe:<br />Besides my embarrassment over chapter 32, my main gripe is the continued use of &#34;plasma bags&#34; to nourish vampires.  Plamsa is not the same as blood---it is the yellow liquid component of blood (it looks like cream soda) in which red blood cells are suspended.  So, if a vampire needs blood to survive, plasma alone would not be enough.  I believe Frost should call them &#34;blood bags&#34; or even &#34;packed red blood cell bags.&#34;  Look it up on Wikipedia if you don't believe me.  FYI, I know this from working in a hospital.<br /><br />The Best Thing About This Book:<br />I like the plot and the fast pace of this series.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I bought this for my son-in-law who had never seen the complete series of Alien moves and he loves it. All we need now is Prometheus to complete the cycle.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really gave my brain a workout! So addicting that I finished it in one sitting. Can't wait for new levels!!
B001NHNG64|5.0|This novel was one of those that you look forward to a few spare minutes so you can<br />sneak a few pages. It kept me in suspense the entire time and with a lot of twists and<br />turns.
0345803485|1.0|As anyone who lives on the internet knows, there is much better fanfiction with more plot, depth, and better sex scenes. This is absolutely awful and only ignorant people could possibly enjoy it.
0425263924|5.0|Well what can I say,  This was as good as the first book.  Sylvia Day will have to write a fourth book.
0143143492|5.0|I was awakened by this book. I have come to understand and subdue my ego and my pain body. I wish to learn more about how i can help others. I wish there was a work book. I wish I could meet Tolle. I am a teacher in two prisons. I want so much to help the women and men I work with. Eckhart Tolle is a God sent!!!!!<br />excellent book.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Like zoo tycoon but with dinosaurs! Get your friends hooked so you can play together! I wish there was a better zoom out though
B004WR125O|5.0|Works exactly as expected.  No glitches so far. Freaked out for a minute when I thought I was going to have to plug this into the usb on the front panel of my receiver - until I realized how to navigate the setup menu of the receiver for the rear usb port.  If you're gonna get an Onkyo network receiver without integrated wifi, don't hesitate to add this one.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Fun for my kid 8 &amp; 10, but I've been known to play myself. Keeps the whole family entertained. Just hope it stays glitch free.
B001G8XON0|5.0|Beautiful and emotionally-attaching.  An even better love story than Romeo & Juliet.  The only musical I've ever liked besides South Park.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|super fun love to play the minions are uber cute and vector ducks it looks just like the real movie awesome
B000GCFO0S|5.0|I have only ever paid for two movies, this and Moulin Rouge.  They are both emotionally-attaching masterpieces.<br /><br />Spoiler alert:<br />I didn't understand the end until a friend explained to me that the characters died in the car crash at the beginning of the movie
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Other &quot;escape the room&quot; games I have played don't keep my interest for that long. Or they are too difficult that I just un install it. Can You Escape is nothing like those games.  It keeps me entertained all the time!! Keep it up!
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|This is the best games presently on the market for tablets and smart phones. I would strongly recommend it to any turn-based RPG fan.
B00CL1SR7O|5.0|My daughter is a real &#34;Rusher&#34; and was really looking forward to the release of this album. Personally I'm not a fan but I can attest that BTR fans will think that this is the greatest album ever. Most of the music resembles the hits from the previous albums so the kids will like that. There are some more sophisticated productions and arrangements compared to the previous work (which my girls made sure was playing in the house incessantly :-) ). If you or your child is a BTR fan, this new album would be loved.
B00D37UQ1K|5.0|I was so excited to get this movie through Amazon Instant, but also apprehensive. To my delight, this movie exceeded my expectations. I'm one of the many who fell in love with The Host and have read it many times. The emotional roller coaster, the philosophical questions about the body and soul and the different perspective on aliens were some of the things I loved about it. I was worried that my hopes would fall short for the film. Overall, I think it did great!<br /><br />There's only so much you can fit into a 2-hour long movie and the film added more \\"action\\" scenes than the book. This left me surprised but happy too. If the movie followed the book so closely, it would have turned into a 3 1/2 hour long affair, and would have dragged on even more. In this way, it can stand on it's own.<br /><br />I've watched it twice already since buying it and it still makes me tear up in many different scenes. This may be because I remember these scenes in the book and remembered how painful it was to read them and why those scenes were important. I wonder if people who haven't read the book would pick up on the emotional scenes like how my sister and I did. The one thing that would have made it 4 and 1/2 stars was that I couldn't always feel that emotion in any of the actors at certain times. Jared wasn't angry enough and Wanda didn't act as frightened or sad as the book portrays. The actor who played Ian, Jake Abel, pretty much was the best along side William Hurt. So yeah - basically missed the emotion and conflict that the book so well described. This might be the divide between the capabilities in writing a book and a script. Even so - it still makes me cry!<br /><br />Regardless, if you are or are not a Host fan try it out and see! It may surprise you.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I really liked reading this book.  Even when I was really sleepy I wasn't able to put it down because it really holds your interest.
B00ABKGG0C|4.0|Just one storyline (kind off) but well written and a page turner.<br />The main character always succeds, a bit to easely sometimes, but I find I just have to see what happens next.
B00DHRLK84|5.0|Long story short I saw it with the wife and we loved it! For not having much blood or cursing in a Z movie this was pretty great! I never read the book so it's probably a good thing.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it, it's very addicting game ,plus its very safe for kids too. It's not easy at all such makes the game very entertaining thanks.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|My favorite quick game to play. Colors are vibrant. Better than other similar games. Try it u will love it!!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I love puzzles like this. It keeps my brain active. But I thought it went too fast. I would like to have more puzzles. Oh the bonus game...love! Graphics are good.
B003F44QRQ|5.0|I had this movie on VHS but I don't have a functioning vcr anymore.  I will eventually get it on dvd or bluray but for now I was happy to stream it from amazon.  Awesome movie, lots of vampire action and the story is good.
B00CL1SR7O|5.0|love the new style - more mature - best album so far - suitable for their young as well as older fans
B00D6BQG1W|3.0|I did enjoy this movie, but not too much.  Although it seems like a fresh idea, I have seen a couple comedy type zombie movies way before this one that included a &#34;good&#34; zombie or two.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I saw on the weather channel weather it said I was going to rain all day but I looked on my phone and it said it was going to rain at night not all day. This app does not have an accurate weather information
B00B2G2RG6|3.0|...but I couldn't. The story was fairly good, but the shows were so dark I couldn't tell what was going on half the time. Also, the police work was stupid in some places - we were yelling at the TV at the bad choices. I had high hopes, but no. I won't be watching a second season.
B00DI75SWM|5.0|It is so worth the $0.99. You will be pleased with it. You can share your posters with your friends and using different types of social media.;)
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Great book, moving, filled with emotion and you get wrapped<br />Up in the characters.  Loved how Laila went back to where Miriam was from at the end.
B0096DZKZC|5.0|this game is so awesome that I compleated all the levels in this game that I got  6 chaos emerlds. I still need to get the last one
B00CM9JKQM|3.0|Ill try not overly nit pick this cd and just stick  to my biggest problem with it which boil down to two things.<br /><br /> I do not care for Todds singing and bare and mind before i go any further its not because i bare any grudge against him for replacing the almighty,does nothing wrong poops rainbows and bunny rabbits Geoff Tate. ( please note sarcasm). Tate is both replaceable in his current state and  todd seems like a real classy  guy  so my criticisms fall entirely on his singing abilities and nothing more. The first problem to my ears with his vocals is the same thing i see with many who sing in the operatic metal genre. They tend to overshoot their range and thus force out high notes  or their attempts to sing in a lower register. This tends to get very cringe worthy for me particularly in what would otherwise be good songs.<br /><br /> Further to my ears it sounds like they reaaaaallly over processed his singing in the studio. Many of the songs sound like they over layered the  vocals far too much and at other times it sounds like they have him  singing through a tin can.<br /><br /> Now onto my second problem at  some times this record especially musically  can feel too safe and by that i mean alot of parts of it feel like the guys just  went back and listened to their old records and then  when it came time to write new material they were just saying something like \\" Okay now lets put that Rage For order Drum  style here\\" and then \\"Maybe a brief flash of empire guitar lick here\\" While that may be fine for some if i want to hear  that ill just go back and listen to those specific old records and it will sound a zillion times better. When they step out of the comfort zone however  i feel like im confronted with extra songs that werent released from a kamelot album<br /><br /> Overall this is a decent record but underwhelming considering all the talk about being free to  write they type of music they wanted and supposedly having all kinds of ideas they were sitting on for quite some time. Given that it doesnt live up the hype for me and if were just to hear this record with out knowing who it was i would just assume its a  decent effort from some  power metal band that has some old qr influences here and there.<br /><br /> As ive  theorized previously  The old qr magic isnt there anymore for the guys (yes tate as well) they can write good songs that are fun to pop in  every once and a while but their song writing capabilities are no where  near where they once were.So i would say if someones expecting material to match the old stuff say the ep to empire or promise land then they like me will be let down quite a bit. If they however can just  view on the record on its own with out comparison they will likely find this to be a good addition to their collection.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I have been listening to this over and over. A real 70's vibe combined with a great variety of music. The lyrics are poetic.

B003G4W49C|5.0|Awesome book. Looking forward to the movie. I am sure it will be great. This little guy is tough and is a good person.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Such a fun game. I just want to keep going and going. I keep hearing... &quot;honey...put down the kindle and back away slowly.&quot;  LOL
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Fun and addicting. I usually don't stick with games long but I've been playing this for a while..I recommend this game all the time to my friends
B003B02O7I|3.0|It's good, but it seems like there's plenty of fluff to get you to the finish line and when it's all said and done there's something left to be desired.  It's worth reading, but it's far from a classic or must read recommendation to others.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I loved the book! And highly suggest it to anyone looking for a good science fiction read. This is coming from a halo series reader
B00632HWOG|2.0|I have difficulty accessing my emails. If I ever succeed in connecting, it shows very old messages and refuses to update. So I have stopped using it.
0060254920|3.0|Bought this to read to my grandkids. Story is simple, wording is also very simple. Leaves a lot to the imagination. Animal characters might be a little scary for preschoolers.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I love it. It entertains me without frustrating me or being silly. Needs full attention and good planning. It is really a good game
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the game its so fun I think every one should get the game it rocks love it whooo
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I love it when I decide to randomly buy a book and it turns out to be a great one! This is a wonderful story and is definitely worth reading!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Everything aboutthe game blew me away. I just started playing mtg about a year ago and I barely have friends that want to play with. Then I just got this game to maybe play a few games here and there. However the graphics music and gameplay blew me away. I get to see so many different decks and strategies. My friends use the same couple decks over and over as do I. But here I go against a different deck each time. I already knew how to play but I sure do wish I had this game for the tutorial when I first started. So in that I recommend this to anyone knew to magic or anyone who loves magic but doesn't get enough play in life. I figure that people who take it more serious and compete won't find it as fun as you are only paying against starter decks and they probably play every day with friends clubs and at tournaments. Anyway for me it's a solid five stars.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this app but I think they should make an ad free version<br /><br />u should get it just beware of ads
B001JNNDBA|5.0|A true cult classic that has additional scenes that were not included in the original release, a must for your collection.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a great game, keeps you guessing makes you think. I wish there was more levels it is so worth it!
0684135051|4.0|It is an OK book if you like that kind of reading, it is different than other knitting books I have read. This one is more like a &#34;Novel&#34;
B00ANA27IU|3.0|But the book makes a bit more sense than the movie so it's worth the read just to try and understand what the heck happened in the movie and why.  Technical and complicated.
0894803123|4.0|Got a lot of good looking receips inside, have been on the go so have not had time to make any yet. The book arrive in speedy time and in good conditon.

B008OJ291W|3.0|All songs written, produced and performed by Jeff Lynne.  Not ELO!  So disappointed.  The songs are still good, but not the &#34;old&#34; sound.  Miss that &#34;old&#34; sound.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|I have read all of the Reacher books, and I along with alot of people thought Tom Cruise was awful casting and I have only just gotten around to watching the movie.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed it and smiled along with the many times I saw the subtle \\"Reacherisms\\" translated to the screen...... when he first meets the DA's daughter and just walks off, the banter before the brawl, when he explains at the end of the movie to one of the bad guys how he figured it out...... \\"Not even I would have checked the M**er\\" as well as many others...Its a credit to Tom Cruise, that he made me forget the obvious physical differences.<br /><br />From the disturbing opening credits, it rips along at a cracking pace and I was surprised how the time went so quickly considering its longer than average 2hrs 12min running time.<br /><br />The look was sharp and Mr McQuarrie has given the movie a neo noir,  hard boiled quality to it, which fits with the character.....it would have been ruined with an expansive \\"Die Hard\\" approach<br /><br />Having now seen it twice, this will be added to my BD collection
B007REV4YI|5.0|Great movie and great item. Included Bluray, DVD and code to watch it on Flixster in HD. Not sure if it supports iTunes movies or the ability to download it from iTunes.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|some was easy some was not and when I finished it I was glad now all I want to do is to play the coming soon levels it so hard to wait
0545425115|5.0|Excellent novel for all ages! I highly recommend this for a great read. Engaging, well written, and entertaining. Clean and appropriate for all audience. Even my husband enjoyed it! This book will suck you in and let you get lost in a great story!

B008BGNMZU|5.0|This group has drawn me in for the past 10+ years. Back in the middle 1990's, I had a chance to see them live in Phoenix, Arizona and they were just as awesome then as they are now! If you need some tunes to mellow out to after a hard day, as I do so often, you will definitely enjoy this new project from Fourplay.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|If u have nothing to do this is a really time consuming game and it teaches u the responsibilities of owning a horse
B0095MVOMC|5.0|Great game for killing time. There is a challenge mode which is default and timed,  but you can turn that off in the settings. There is a zoom mode also.  Just two finger zoom like you would any picture,  be careful to keep your finger touching when you scroll because quick touches, as I found out,  register as a bad guess. numbers are beautifully hidden not just placed in the scene.  Excellent game.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|This movie came super fast. I've been a fan of the Final Fantasy series for quite a long time. I've watched the normal version of this 25 times, but I really loved the complete version. I watch this on my PS3 and the audio and picture quality are fantastic. I recommend this to any Final Fantasy lover.

0345803450|3.0|Starting out like a classic spy novel, protagonist Serena Frome tells us that many years ago, in the 1970s, when she was in her 20s, she was sent on a secret mission for Britain's MI-5. Rather than skullduggery in some darkened Cold War Eastern European city, though, Serena's mission is to pretend to represent an arts council and offer funding to a fledgling author, Tom Haley, who shows promise as someone whose writings will support the interests of British intelligence.<br /><br />But before telling us the story of Serena and Tom, Serena fills us in on her unconventional path to MI-5. The beautiful, clever daughter of a country Church of England Bishop, she goes off to Cambridge University, where she--following time-honored espionage fiction tradition--is recruited by an older don, Tony Canning, who prepares her to enter the intelligence service. Though this is a well-worn path to spydom in Britain, Serena is unusual because, first of all, she's a woman at a time when there were very few in British intelligence, and second, because her academic record is not at all impressive.<br /><br />MI-5 is no place for someone as naive and malleable as Serena.  Deceit and betrayal have been the moons that circle Serena, and she is under their tidal influence from the time she goes off to Cambridge, succumbing to her mother's insistence that she present herself as a mathematics student rather than the English student she wants to be. Reeling from another betrayal by Tony Canning, she is powerless to resist the gravitational pull of deceit in MI-5, and the place they offer her within that world.<br /><br />But the worst deceiver of all is Serena herself, as she so readily allows herself to take on a role in this squalid little Operation Sweet Tooth, and to continue the masquerade far beyond the point of no return.  She is weak and doesn't seem to know herself well enough to be true to her own character. She falls in love easily; far more easily than anyone would who had real strength of character.  She is swayed by the numbers of people who want her to be a professional liar, rather than the far fewer people in her life who truly care for her and are honest and straightforward.<br /><br />Fans of Ian McEwan will likely be intrigued by Tom Haley, whose background and work resemble McEwan's. Though I enjoyed the descriptions of Tom's short stories, the character was so sketchily drawn that it was hard to care about him at all.  This was true of all the male characters. Serena is a much more developed character, but a lot of the time I found her weak-willed character frustrating and annoying. I kept hoping the book would veer off and be about Serena's lively Cockney friend, Shirley, but that was not to be.  Maybe next time.<br /><br />As a study of deceit, betrayal, and their consequences, the novel is somewhat more successful, though definitely only for those who enjoy a slow-developing study. The ending plot twist seemed self-consciously clever to me, and not that surprising. But I can easily imagine some readers will be intrigued by it, and I don't mean that in a snarky way.<br /><br />As always, McEwan's writing is lyrical and elegiac, but also wickedly pointed. In the end, while I enjoyed the writing and the themes, the characters left me flat. The book didn't touch or intrigue me in the way, say, William Boyd's [[ASIN:1620402963 Restless]] did.rength of character.

B005HE5J7I|4.0|Excellent story . It really is a history book told through the eyes of the people living it at the time. I have been to London a number of times and have always enjoyed the walks through its history. This book gives the city a life of its own and weaves its story through the centuries.

B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I have all of these movies on LaserDisc but decided to go ahead and upgrade to Blu-Ray and I'm glad I did. The THX clip at the beginning is almost worth the cost of the set. In surround sound at high volume the THX bit would scare little children it is so powerful and dramatic.<br /><br />I'm sure most of us with a taste for adventure films have seen the movies countless times so why was I interested in buying this set you may ask? Although the LaserDisc was great for its time that time has passed and I wanted to see how the latest permutations were looking and sounding and I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />If you have not seen these movies by some stretch of the imagination, you do have a treat in store if you have any interest in classic adventure films. Harrison Ford was in his prime when the series started and he seemed to hold up adequately all the way through the last one.<br /><br />While some are darker in tone, my wife walked out on \\"Temple of Doom,\\" they are generally mild by comparison with many newer films. If you enjoy adventure movies these Blu-Ray copies of the series are a worthy addition to your library.

This is a major discovery, of sorts, for me. I had no idea DS was so good, and such a terrific group. There isn't one track from this two cd set that I don't like. A major addition to my music collection. In movie-review parlance, &#34;not to be missed!&#34;

This movie was slow and the characters were not likable. The acting was horrendous and the plot....was there a plot, I can't remember I was so bored. I'm sorry to say I will never get that hour and a half of my life back. I'm giving it two stars because the special effects were decent.

B001LM1456|1.0|My son was biting me to stop watching this terrible movie.  He did finish watching it with me, but I had to make him and we both were not happy.  It was a total waste of $9.99.  The Avengers and Iron Man are much better.  I would recommend jumping out of an airplane without a parachute before watching this movie.<br /><br />What was Marvel thinking!<br /><br />Poor plot, poor acting, poor story!  The Avenger's Banner and Hulk was much better.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|A Heavyweight PDF Reader you should get from Google Play and not Amazon - this goes along with the rule of thumb for Android application acquisition that states you should never get an application from the Amazon marketplace that you can get from Google Play.

B001ANSSDC|2.0|Okay, so I wanted to read this book before watching the movie.  I had no idea it was all about freaking Eagles football and a short chapter about dancing--two things I could care less about. The writing was also atrocious.  I thought I was reading the journal of an 11 year old boy, which maybe it was meant to be written like that, because the main character is emotionally retarded.  I simply stopped reading this book.  I've only done that three times in my life and I've read hundreds of books.
B000JQUZCI|3.0|Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is a brilliant read, and really goes against what the &#34;pop culture&#34; understanding of the Frankenstein beast truly is.
1932100660|5.0|A must-read for every person on the planet.  The truth is that &#34;The China Study&#34; was not financed by big business, it involves decades and decades of honest, solid research, and it provides what millions of us are looking for, and that is  ... irrefutable evidence that a plant-based diet provides all that we need.  We have been and continue to be constantly and continuously sold a horrible, sickening, dishonest bill of goods by the beef and dairy industries as they inundate us day in and day out with their expensive, self-serving ads that tell us that we and our children need those awful products for our health when, in fact, not only do we not need them but they are exactly what will kill us if we consume them.  All because they are not interested in our health at all, not even a little bit, but only our money and the corporate bottom line.  And other than this book, which is one of the best ways to reach masses of people, Dr. Campbell is not looking to sell us anything.  I love this guy so much.  He is my hero.

088029261X|5.0|Alot of people have been giving this book bad reviews for a few reasons. They say the text is too small, it's double columned, and that the book doesn't have all the Sherlock Holmes stories. I think there may be 2 versions of this book. The one I bought for a penny used has 4 novels and 56 stories which according to other sources on the internet is complete. The book I recieved is over 1100 pages and the pages are not double columned. Also the text is normal size, not too small at all. So, before you decide to not buy this book based on other reviews you should contact the seller and find out which version of the book they have because I'm very happy with the one I got. For only one measly penny(+ 3.99 S+H).
B0064BCNA4|3.0|I use this rarely to help tune my guitar, but it is not bad for that purpose. Tuning apps are obviously better though.
159102594X|5.0|First off I must say that I've never actually written a review for any book before but have been coming here for years to read other peoples reviews before plowing on into a book...especially a Trilogy or Series!<br /><br />So why after finishing Joe Abercombie's 1st Law Trilogy am I impelled to?<br />Well because it was just SO Damn Enjoyable!<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I sway with vast majority of the fantasy loving public when they cry, 'George RR Martin's 'A Song of Ice and Fire' is the best fantasy work to date', it is!...But then this, well this is the most Enjoyable!<br /><br />Sure it doesn't have the epicness (if that is a word) and grandeur of Martin's work, or the two page details of the smell of the docks or the taste of a lemon pie... But it was never meant to.<br /><br />This is a real character driven fantasy unlike anything I've ever read before (and I've read my fair share of the genre). The characters are real R Rated individuals, much like people really are...There is no sugar coating of fairy or elven dust here, they're grey, gritty, flawed individuals (once again much like the real world) with slight sarcastic but cynical undertones...Saying all that, Abercombie somehow (and this will sound contradictory to what I just described) has created the most colorful and satisfying characters and really has you fall in love with them by the end of the Trilogy...even the crippled, resigned torture!<br /><br />The other major thing of note with this Book/Trilogy is that it is a page turner... but unlike any other page turner I have ever read. Normally with a page turner, some climatic action scene takes place and the author will build up the suspense and then build it up some more...then, leave out the one final piece to give the scene resolution and normally wont reveal what that was, until 4 chapters later!<br />This is a page-turner of a different nature. It is a page-turner because every page is just so damn enjoyable to read. From Abercrombie's plot twisting, to his intelligent character banter, to his beautifully detailed battle scene, which I believe are the strongest, most vivid, fight scenes out of any author I've read.<br />I think you get my point but there real was not one weak chapter in this whole Trilogy. Not no chapter you had to trudge heavily through, no character you didn't want to read more about.<br />As I finished one chapter I wanted to keep reading purely for the pleasure of continuing to read...not because I had to find our how the good guy finally overcame all odds to beat the bad guy!<br /><br />It's not ASOIAF and to be honest I was glad it wasn't...Martin has enough of his own pages, chapters, books and TV show to keep us satisfied (if he'll ever finish it!)...<br /><br />Abercrombie really has given us a refreshing new type of Fantasy Series. One that really deserves your attention!  Read it!
B007TMON8M|2.0|Got it as free app of the day, played it once, didn't find it enthralling. Cannot complain when it was free.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This fan  is fun. It has pretty good graphics.  It is so fun to play too. This is any awesome game for all ages. I recommend it for everyone who loves the movies.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|Not a bad game. A good diversion, especially on a tablet. Would not pay for, but got it as free app of the day.
B0053O89IS|4.0|I must have missed something because one minute we are witnessing a pregnant Bones with Brennan at her side and the next episode they've already had the baby!  It was a let down as I thought it gave a perfect opportunity to show Bones giving birth and her \\"clinical\\" reaction.  I was confused and surprised that they weren't more creative with this.  Surely, once she actually \\"had her real baby\\" they could have done something.  I mean, they managed before with a woman who wasn't actually pregnant!
B0058VW36U|3.0|Cut the Rope is a pretty decent game that is worth a few hours of entertainment - though I am not in favor of paying for it, getting it as the free application of the day was nice.

B0000256KE|4.0|This is probably the among the strangest albums I own.  Beginning with the cover, that's Amanda Lear there with the black Photoshopped panther.  The story with her is that nobody knows if she's a man or a woman, and Ms. Lear ain't saying!  Ok, the music - pretty fantastic.  Long a lover of Roxy Music and British glam.  Roxy Music took glitter to new heights, and damn if it wasn't all intoxicating.  Brian Ferry, Eno (his last album with Roxy), Phil Manzanera, Andy Mackay and Phil Thompson were excellent musicians, but in someways this was their least \\"showy\\" album.  Songs have a distinct melancholy side, especially \\"Grey Lagoons.\\"  My favorite just might be \\"The Bogus Men,\\" even though it seems to go on forever. The album, as always the case w/ Roxy, starts with an upbeat number, in this case \\"Editions of You.\\"  However, the freak flag goes to \\"In Every Dream Home a Heartache,\\" Ferry's love song to his inflatable companion.
B000P0J09W|5.0|This is just a classic movie I had seen as a child, and loved the mysticism of the tale. Adventure finely captured to spark enthusiasm towards exploring the world around us...

0425263924|4.0|\\"who cares about wine and roses? Anyone can do that. Showing somebody you can't live without them? That's romance\\"-sigh love that sentiment one Eva lives by with Gideon.<br /><br />This third installment brings a winding down of the murder of Eva's stepbrother or so we think it is at a end for her and Gideon and shows us the growth and maturity these two have begun to have. We see that they have become secure in themselves and their love for one another to begin to build a trust for each other and their relationship.  A beautiful endeavor to see.<br /><br />\\"I look at you, angel, and I want you so badly. I want to be with you, listen to you, talk to you. I want to hear you laugh and hold you when you cry.

I want you\\"- makes you fall in love with Gideon even more when you read this. You want to go down the rabbit hole with this dark man. One with a past he is struggling with and secrets to reveal.<br /><br />These two have a long way to go and have done something absolutely beautiful in this book (won't reveal but you will squee with delight) but was it a good thing to do is the question at this juncture?<br /><br />Cary our favourite side character is as charming and sweet as ever. His relationship with Trey is progressing and he is getting to be a more mature man or is he? His life gets turned upside down as well. Will this turn him around and how will it affect him and Trey? Hopefully their relationship will continue to build and be strong for he is going to need Trey and Eva more now than ever.<br /><br />Family dynamics come to play in this book as well. We see Eva's relationship with her mom and dad change. Some good and some not so good.<br /><br />Although I am a little upset that the author didn't do as said and only have three books I am anxious to see what the next chapter in the lives of Gideon, Eva and even Cary will bring forth. Will the mystery of the murder play a role? I don't know but can't wait to find out.ll the mystery of the murder play a role? I don't know but can't wait to find out.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|Great backpack for my DSLR and 2 lens. Thought about the cannon one, but I am glad I chose this one.<br />Everything holds up well, nothing broken yet. I had it several months. Did some camping and it holds up well.<br />Definitely recommend it over that other type. Great Deal!!
B009A882D0|5.0|I was thrilled with my purchase of CCR's CD's. Been a long time since I listened to them. Brought back some great memories.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game so much. I play it every day. I love this game. This game is very awesome.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Okay, now first off it's a great game for despicable me lovers. And I would also like to update people on a few problems that people have had after downloading on their kindle. They say that at the menu th  game shuts down but I have had no problem with the game since I bought it. The only reason it would not be working is probably only because all the memory has been taken up by other apps and games you've downloaded or played.
B003UBTX72|3.0|I was amazed by Keith's lucidity after what he's been through. The book, while interesting, droned on- one day he's working with so and so, next day he's with another bunch- but everyday he's getting high. After a while there is more concern as to where the drugs are coming from then getting to work with the music. There were times when I wished I could just reach in and strangle him, exposing his son Marlon, who at 7 years old goes on tour with the Stones with his dad- still doing drugs. Cold turkey here, cold turkey there they still don't learn and these stories get tiring after a few episodes.<br />Interesting, even to me as a drummer, were the explanations of the open chord tuning of his instruments and lack of the lowest string on the guitar. Without that, nobody's going to be able to copy his sound on a regularly tuned instrument.<br />At 500+ pages of his life- it depressed me and I wanted the book to end, but I kept on reading to the end. The cover picture really says it all. Good, bad depressing, surprising in some ways- that's his life.
B00C9U9YOW|2.0|The album seems forced and put out amongst distractions. Very uneven effort, but their stuff always was hit and miss, this just seems magnified. Rated R had some lame stuff on it, but was balanced by really, really good stuff.  In my opinion they peaked at Songs, put out a week album next and in 07 made another solid record to rebound.  Seems like Josh misses the collaborative effort of other guys like Nick and Mark. The thing that irritated me the most was the hype about Nick and Mark being on the album when they are buried like studio background musicians. Super disrespectful to both, particularly Mark who is an icon. Queens should wrap it up. I've been a fan since the Man Ruins records stuff, coming over from Kyuss. Who knows maybe other generations will like it, but in the end music is music and this is weak. Not surprised from seeing their live shows the last couple of years.  Josh had been fortunate for many years to be surrounded by great musicians, and the recent live shows are almost like punching it in.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|This has to be one of the best gay-themed movies made thus far. The story is set in San Pedro and La Holla, CA. It's about Zach (Trevor Wright) who falls in love with Shaun (Brad Rowe). Shaun is the older brother of Gabe (Ross Thomas), Zach's best friend. There's roughly a 12-year difference between Zach and Shaun. Gabe goes off to college in Santa Barbara. While he's gone Zach visits Gabe's house to work on his surf board that he's left in the backyard. Unbeknownst to Zach Shaun is staying there temporarily until the lease on his new place in Los Angeles begins. He surprises Zach. Both are delighted to see each other. It's obvious that Zach has had a crush on Shaun for some time. He invites Shaun to surf with him. Shaun takes up the offer and the romance between them begins.<br /><br />\\"Shelter\\" is a coming of age story in that it's about Zach coming to terms with his sexual orientation. Being older Shaun has already come to terms with his sexuality. He helps Zach to accept who he is. There's much drama in this film as Zach not only comes to terms with his sexuality he has a very trying relationship with his sister, Jeanne (Tina Holmes). She frequently puts Zach in a situation where he has to care for her five-year-old son, Cody (Jackson Wurth). But Zach loves his nephew. He is both uncle and father to him. And Cody worships Zach.<br /><br />Zach and Shaun both love Cody. Shaun's very good with him and loves the funny things he says. Cody tells his Uncle Zach, \\"Shaun rocks!\\" The three of them make a wonderful family. Thankfully, this movie has a \\"Hollywood ending\\".<br /><br />There are a lot of surfing scenes and beautiful footage of Southern California. Trevor Wright actually does surf and and ride a skateboard in those scenes. Both he and Brad Rowe are terrific actors. The two of them have great chemistry together. \\"Shelter\\" is a love story anyone would appreciate.

B00CWVGBEO|1.0|I have to say, it's the worst work Arnold's ever done, don't waste your money. The whole thing is trite & cheesy, I was supremely disapointed.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|Overall, I am happy with how the series drew to a close. Not quite the ending I had expected, but I guess all of us who have read into the series this far have had plenty of time to stew over how we each think it should have ended. I have to give Brandon Sanderson a large amount of gratitude for his efforts finishing Robert Jordan's WoT.<br /><br />I thought Sanderson`s voice and writing style came out strongest in this book than in the two prior. Not that I think this is bad, it just threw me a curveball every now and again, particularly in the dialogues. The story moves along very quickly, which may have been done out of necessity. The authors have done a pretty good job of wrapping up the numerous plotlines and providing closure for most of the characters.<br /><br />To anyone who hasn't read AMoL (and I realize I'm reviewing this LONG after AMoL came out), I strongly encourage it. I wasn't able to put this down, and hope that others are excited to read it.
B002XXPNXG|3.0|Before Midnight although it is the last movie in this series it is the first one I saw.  My wife and I proceeded to Amazon Before Sunrise and Sunset.  I guess I would rank Sunset third out of the three, with Midnight being my favorite.

1432794426|5.0|I've read a lot of MJ-Books, but this is simply the best.<br />It is pure, honest, emotional. It makes me laugh and cry the same time!<br />If you want to know the truth about Michael Jackson, read this book.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|What a beautiful story! Written elegantly! Inspirational words about friendship, kindness, and courage! Definitely a must read for middle grade children!,
3836538725|5.0|If you like b&w photography, this is a must buy. The images are outstanding with the Salgado signature. Even though I have other Salgado books, this is now my favourite.
B009186JYI|5.0|By 1965 when this little documentary was made, the Stones had still not produced a really good album. That would wait for 1966 and \\"Aftermath.\\" But they were huge, nonetheless, after a string of big hits like \\"Satisfaction\\" and \\"The Last Time.\\" The most interesting for me was the frenzy at a show in Ireland when the band is virtually attacked on stage by foaming teenagers. They literally cover the stage, so the band is eventually forced to stop playing. But they were playing a really lame song at the time, so it must have been their looks that drove these Irish kids bonkers. The fans all look about 14, and the adults look like leftovers from WW2. There's quite a bit of jerky camera work, as we see a lot of Andrew Loog Oldham, the producer, who was forced out after going nuts on drugs. Brian Jones speaks in his soft feminine voice. All sound very bored with being asked the most inane questions. Mick is the only one who looks alive, but Bill is also pretty perky here. The Stones would only go on to get much bigger after this late 1965 artifact. It's a wonderful look into an era that remains fascinating to this day.
B0097EWK3A|3.0|could be a little more exciting, maybe a couple of brain teasers thrown in periodically and more hidden object challengers

B005LAIIS0|1.0|Nothing short of a cold cash would make me sit through this movie. My son finally threw in the towel half way and I was thrilled to shut it down. Bad story, bad characters, too much cursing with no real story. Evil looking scary violent wolves was just too over the top. The grey faded to black, power down.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Ads are too intrusive with insufficient weather information.  New version is a downgrade from the previous version. Controls are cumbersome and the busy background is unnecessary. Deleted it and will not reinstall.

B000A6EXNO|4.0|It is soft and clean due to high quality rubber used and molding technique. But after installation, I don't see any difference in the light block, maybe, because I wear glasses. It's not expensive and a hassle to return, so I will keep it on the camera.
B00BC5I6Q2|2.0|The characters are all caricatures.  None evokes empathy.  The writing is sophomoric, and the technique of having Kevin Spacey speak to the audience is annoying.  We watched three episodes and put it in the trash.
B003G4W49C|5.0|My husband read it a long time ago and when he saw the movie previews he told me to read it.  This is a great book! The author did an amazing job at keeping you wanting to know more and read more.  Once you pick up the book, it is hard to put it down.

B005FISBTO|5.0|This is one series that has a strange twist... the bad guy is the good guy..??<br />It has all the elements of a ShowTime drama - a little bit of humor, a little bit of creep thriller, a little bit of make you think, and a whole lot of serial killer drama.

1583334386|4.0|This book focuses on that all-important subject, self-discipline. It is very well researched and lays out why self-discipline is so important and how to cultivate it. It includes a slew of interesting research and anecdotes, without being overly dry or boring. The material is also very well organized, and there are exercises to help you develop self-discipline. All in all, this is an excellent book that anyone can benefit from.
B004P68T30|5.0|best app ever! kids love it. can't get enough! dr. sues reborn... awesome! would  recommend to all parents with small kids.
B0077POH8M|3.0|I tried this on an A75m-ITX mITX motheboard with an AMD A8-3870 CPU. A little difficult install due to the not so great instructions but a youtube video helped.<br /><br />During the installation I noticed that the CPU cooler pipes were bumping against the slot 1 RAM. I am not cool with that. Rotating 90 degrees to get the pipes away from RAM won't work, as the CPU cooler feet won't align with the screw holes after the rotation. Low profile RAM may not work either. But I haven't tested with LP RAM.<br /><br />I believe that rotating 90 degrees will work for intel boards since the cooler feet are symmetrically placed. So if the CPU cooler touches the RAM then rotate by 90 degrees. The youtube video also highlights the problem and the solution. Video link: [...]<br /><br />To give this CPU Cooler a try, I removed slot 1 RAM and finished the installation. Powered up my machine and CPU is running very cool. 30-32 C during idle and 45-50 C at full load. Plenty of air flow around the CPU also keeps the motherboard components cool.<br /><br />BTW, runs very quiet. Barely audible!<br /><br />I don't recommend this CPU cooler for mITX builds with AMD processors. But should be ok for mATX and ATX builds. As the title reads, great CPU cooler with one major design flaw.

B006VFLIYK|4.0|Pretty good one to read even though it is a bit different than the author's usual. Action packed as always.
B006N0YWGY|2.0|I'm an older person whose reflexes aren't as sharp as a younger person. Found it very frustrating. Heated up my Kindle before game was completed.
0812971825|4.0|Elizabeth Strout deals with intricate emotions in most of her books, yet each of them is unlike any of the others, which can be attributed to her excellence as a writer.  I particularly liked the circumstances in this book, since most of us have dealt with feelings of insecurity as to our place with our friends and acquaintances.  When disaster strikes, we often feel that friends desert us, but conversely, people pop up to help that we never thought of.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This app changed appearance over night &amp; I'm trying to be positive about it. A matter of getting used to it. There's more to this app than &quot;rain or shine&quot; - I especially  appreciate the maps which help my &quot;street sense&quot; when I go to unfamiliar places.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I love it, now my grandson can charger the kindle fire, by himself....I love this product.....Thank you. I would recommend for pele to buy this product...
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I begin my day by checking what is expected in my neighborhood as well as where all the people I  care about live. It is so easy and convenient.
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|I don't know how they made the water swallow up the people and cause so much havoc as shown in this movie, it was like being in that disaster yourself.  How those people lived thru this terror is beyond me, she is the bravest person and her son is exceptional.  True love showed thru for the man and his love of his family as her's did, great film.
B0097C8XL0|1.0|but I'm tired of it alerting me about 8 to more times a day, every few moments (yes, seriously) that it has stopped playing, even though I'm not playing it. It is apparently running in the background so I have deleted it.<br /><br />update: [July 14th, 2013]: even after deleting it just from device and cloud, I kept getting alerts it was running and stopped, so I had to make sure it was completely removed by going to Applications and uninstalling from there - aggravating!<br /><br />According to the Kindle, it was still running and taking power from my device even after I had removed it from the device and deleted it from the cloud - GRRR. very upset by this because that let me know that this GAME took/used information from my device.<br /><br />moved down to 1 star from 3. I would put 0 but there isn't an area for 'no stars' - I do not like apps/programs/software that still stays 'logged in', sucking information/power/whatever, without asking me first - especially when I have deleted it!!
B003XDXVXO|5.0|Very cute movie! i loved it, jennifer lopez is such a star! you don't expect how it is going to end =)
0062082353|4.0|No hype...just the facts presented by someone that was actually in combat and understood what needed to be done.<br />RIP Mr. Kyle.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Love these books<br /><br />Just the right blend of suspense,humor and romance. Wish they were longer. And love the show too!
B0006GANOQ|5.0|To me this is one of the best action films ever made. The quality of the script, performances and action remain as fresh as when it first came out. It is like a grown up rollercoaster ride.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|I really enjoy Archer's books. I've read almost all of them. This one didn't disappoint. It was filled with such rich writing and creative details. I've noticed some negative reviewers saying this or that about Archer's book, as if they think the author should have written it differently to suit their tastes. Nothing irks me more than high-on-the-horse reviewers thinking they can write a book better than the author, and then penalizing it with low-star ratings because of that. The hubris of some people! I'm not against negative reviews per se, but I do think people should be respectful of the time and hard work that goes into a profession, including book writing. I also think that reviewers who rant and rave negatively about a book's grammar (or other elements) should make sure their own spelling and grammar is impeccable, or they end up looking like idiots. With that being said, I thoroughly enjoyed this author's writing and wouldn't change a thing (I certainly don't think *I* could write this (or any) book better than the author--I'm fine with my accounting job, thank you very much!), nor do I expect any author to rewrite his/her book to suit ME!). The gall.<br /><br />It was a good book. I will look for his next one.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|After months of waiting for this to come out it had a very limited story line the actors were just going through the motions, hardly any real emotion or feelings at all. The other thing that both I was hoping for a blu ray copy along with the 3D copy and a regular dvd.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Really funny game that keeps on workin even when you are not playing so you can easily reach your target also during the night. I advice it!
B00A85EMVK|5.0|Classic movie to have in your collection and now on Blu Ray enjoy the experience even more. Great story for a young Tom Cruise who will rocket to stardom from this movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game to play!! I love the graphics and the sounds of the app!! I am a big fan of the despicable me characters!! Absolutely love it
B007PVHANM|5.0|This is a very well made documentary and worth buying. It really captures the essence of Bob Marley's life, his successes and failures and the environment in which he grew up and thrived.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Playing this with my daughter and we love it!  Can't wait to continue with more levels! It is challenging and fun!
B00AEFXZ1C|5.0|Great soundtrack to this movie. I would recommend this movie and music for persons that like to workout. Storyline is good also.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Except to stop paying attention to everything while figuring out how to &quot;escape&quot;. Very addicting. Try sleeping while being stuck in escape land
B0019FOC5E|5.0|I enjoy the music, good! Buy it you will enjoy too. I love ABBA music  - so I love this too.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|Love this game as much as can you escape. Hope everyone New to the game enjoys as much as I do.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|We watched a rented version of this probably 6 times before we ever saw the stage production.  Loved how we had the subtitles to learn the words.  We were worried the stage production wouldn't live up to this, but it was very good.  You need to watch to the very end when 4 of the past Jean Valjan's sing together!  Love the innkeeper and his wife in this one!  We also really like Javert in this one!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game, it keeps you on your game. It would make an excellent game for  those starting the early stages of memory loss. I'm constantly playing it. Hope everyone else whose played the game enjoys it as much as I do. My son is in the gaming business and would like it as well, that is if he had a kindle fire to play it on.
B009O5CLZY|4.0|Very amusing game , keeps you amused for hours without boring you, the levels are progressive, getting more challenging as you take on the mountain with the help of some woodland creatures, and collect points and coins to better equip Sven, defiantly would suggest it to friends.
B008220BLG|4.0|I have been fairly intentional about resisting the popular but dark genres of vampire and zombie movies. But some good friends recommended \\"Warm Bodies\\" so I thought I would give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised. The movie served up an entertaining and creative mix of drama, romance, comedy, action and, of course, zombies. I was immediately drawn into the plot and eclectic characters, and captivated from beginning to end. And in the end, \\"my heart was strangely warmed\\" (a famous quote from John Wesley for those of you of a Methodist persuasion). In this movie, loving the unlovable (and what can be more unlovable than a flesh-eating zombie?!) proved to be the key to both personal transformation and the renewal of a hopelessly broken, apocalyptic world. In the end, love and forgiveness triumphs over hatred and fear; lavish grace trumps militaristic legalism, and all's well that ends well. Escapist fare, perhaps, from our broken world marred by hatred, fear, and division. But perhaps not.  Perhaps love is all we lack, and all we need.
B00COO2D6O|4.0|Miss the flamethrower from the first one but i am excited to see what they are planing to add to this one down the road. Hopefully some things that will add some more tactical options to the table
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think minion rush is the best game so far in the year of 2013.Watch Despicable Me 2 now playing
1400052181|5.0|What a beautiful and surprising book. I expected a history of HeLa cells, and what I got was a portrait of several generations of a family, a discussion of race in America, and the evolution of medical ethics with respect to research. I thought the author may have been too much of a central figure in her book (another story about a White woman making things better for a Black family), but I believe that Skloot presented her subjects with compassion and respect. In the end, the story she told was just as much hers as it was Henrietta's, and her daughter, Deborah's. I highly recommend this book.
B005V2EVBQ|2.0|It is difficult to get it to stand up.  The slot in the back is not deep enough and cannot hold the Kindle in place.  A complete waste of money.
159463176X|4.0|And The Mountains Echoed!!  As for Khaled Hosseini other books, I really liked it...and found this story very interesting and again, hated to put it down.  He met all my expectations as it brought back many of the areas and people  I met while living in the middle east for 3 years.  Although the second book will always be my favorite, I enjoyed this book tremendously...<br /><br />Nettie Nichols
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Pretty neat running game, similar to subway surfed but much more interesting.  Great challenges, plus who doesn't love the minions?
B007SGM084|4.0|This trilogy was good. I wasn't sure I would like it. It flowed from one book to the next. I will recommend this trilogy.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show is absolutely amazing!! My fiance and I are addicted to it!! We cannot wait to watch season 4!! :)
B004Z4LZ7E|2.0|Not much unique work or look at the artistic process here. Very thin and the writing is superficial. Maybe a better one will cover the trilogy, my guess is he had little involvement here.
B0095MVOMC|1.0|I installed it and ended up deleting it a few minutes later.  My antivirus software detected malware in this app. Just wanted to give everyone a heads up, not looking to get trolled.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|I am rating this product based on Sabbath music - not music in general. It's a 5/5 as far as Sabbath albums are concerned. Not &#34;phoned in&#34; or hastily put together. I was apprehensive after considering the age of the members, distance since the last record, etc...however I'm so glad I purchased this record. Songs are thick, heavy and solid. Great balance between Iommi's riffs/solos and Butler's bass. I do wonder though about the &#34;layered&#34; guitar work: there's a rhythm guitar during each solo - not sure if Iommi played on both and Rubin melded these during production, or if a not-named-session player filled in during recording. Anyhow - not a deal breaker. Best hard rock/heavy metal album to come out in years.
1781162646|4.0|A quick summer read. Fun to follow the summer break adventures of<br />college students in an old school fun park. Personalities, mysteries, and<br />New experiences intertwine as summer progresses into Fall. Add in a bit<br />of romance with King's descriptive style of writing and I zoomed thru to<br />a somewhat predictable ending with bait of supernatural thrown in.<br />On a tv interview King said this was only published in paperback because<br />he wished it was sold from a wire spin rack as in the 50s and 60s.<br />Think of this place and time not that's paced cell phone age. If you<br />remember repaying to use the house phone for a 3 min long distance call<br />you will identify well with the story.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is just like temple run but it is a good one even though there's been a lot of redo's of it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|You can create your own village from a great movie! It takes a while to really get going but once you get to about level 5 it gets really fun because you can afford more items for your village.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|I'm disappointed. I've heard so many good reviews over this author and this book; spent eleven dollars on it and I couldn't even force myself to feel a connection with these characters. They just didn't seem real to me; felt like I was watching someone else's life fly by instead of actually being apart of the ups and downs she experienced with her illness. The guy... I couldn't feel that ~over the moon~  love she had for him. It felt more like something you'd say instead of something you actually felt if that makes sense. Over all, I wish I could've saved my money but oh well
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I APPSULOTELY LOVE IT!! It . Is the most awesome game ever! It can only get better and better and better and better and better and better and better and better and better and better and better and better and better and better and better and better and better and!!!!!!!
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Beautiful graphics. Discreet sound.<br />Many designs.<br />I do love it.<br />I erased all the games I had before this one.<br />Recommended.<br />Logic designs and graphics.<br />Easy and ready menu.<br />Nerver had a beauty like this.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Can't wait for the next book.<br />Gideon and Eva have such a complex relationship.  It makes you really think about what people go through in abusive childhoods.  Thank God they found each other.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book in my opinion was a step up from the son of Neptune. Lots of thrills and action to keep you reading. I definitely recommend this book for anyone reading the lost heroes series.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|The filming is really cool and the computer generation is so realistic!<br />My all time favorite movie this yr.<br />Hope to have him star in another sic-fi from this book soon!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it it is so good get the app I rate it five I would have rated it a 100000000000000000000000000000&empty;0000000000000000000000&empty;0000&empty;infenady and beyond.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I really enjoy this app, it's simple buy it does the job! I recommend it.<br />Not only gives you the time but also the weather. Two thums up!!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Simply an awesome series.... I just cannot understand why no one has plugged that A-hole governor!!!<br />Imaginative, in depth gory good entertainment, hard to stop watching... kinda' like a car wreck you can't help but slow down to look at. Highly recommended.
B0067R0APK|5.0|The other app changed their user interface and did not show a way out of the ads that began appearing. Switched to Accu and really like the user interface and the no ads in the paid version. Thanks Accu!!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I really like the way the producer's kind of threw all of the central character's of the recent single hero flicks into a bunch.<br />Fun to watch and I highly recommend it for a group of people to watch, it is so much more fun that way. There are some boring parts but the highlights more than make up for it!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My 7 year old loves playing this game. Cant wait for new levels to open up. This really got her thinking in a different way.
B00BEXB18M|5.0|I must say... I really loved most of Megadeth albums. When I heard the title for the album, I thought... \\"oh no... another 'Risk' album.... which too me was it's weakest to date.<br /><br />BUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. I was wrong.......... Dead-a** wrong!<br /><br />This album, gets better as the album progresses. Mustaine and crew have done it again. While remaining true to the metal heart, the album remains heavy and crunchy - with fulfilling riffs and harmonies - a great mixture for any metal appetite.<br /><br />The album is strong - with a wonderful mix of old Megadeth with some heavier and chunkier guitar - with a good blend of riveting solos in many places... and Dave's vocals still battle on. (Dave, it seems my friend that your vocals are getting stronger and still gutteral as expected.)<br /><br />I still love the fact that Megadeth can still produce excellent songs that speak to the world on current issues that plague humanity. Always an intelligent lyricist........<br /><br />All I can say, is that Megadeth has definitely redeemed itself time and time again since \\"Risk\\".<br /><br />I don't have an overall favorite, but \\"Dance in the Rain\\" and \\"Beginning of Sorrow\\" ... speaks to who I am - a fighter for freedom and truth. To all the diehard thrash fans (I was one diehard for years, but long since saw that to lock myself into one mode was not open minded at all and I was missing on alot, but) there's still enough metal here to please one and all.<br /><br />Thanks Dave - I've been inspired by your music since I was 13 years old... that's 27 years of great music and a wonderful journey for my mind and soul........ Thanks...... Metal lives on!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Peace, truth, freedom and long healthy lives to us all.
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|The grandsons really enjoy this movie.  It offers a unique fantasy view of how video game character view life once the arcades are closed.  Fun for all.
B009JVSAVM|5.0|Making my way through the seasons from first to fifth and enjoying every disk. I am new to the program and watching it in the order it was filmed helps me understand the character dynamics much better.
B00APJLY0Q|4.0|Purchased viewing rights to this movie as it's a favorite with my grandsons from ages 8 to ????  Humor throughout.
B00CA4S27W|5.0|For those who may not be familiar, the music of Blackmore's Night is an alchemical brew of Renaissance and Medieval music, Celtic, English folk, and rock influences. The seven-piece band employs a wide range of instruments harkening from the Middle Ages to the present. \\"Dancer and the Moon\\" is their ninth studio release, and is available in two versions. One is the standard CD by itself, and the other is a \\"Deluxe Edition,\\" which also includes a DVD, and sells for just a few dollars more. On the DVD are bonus videos of four of the songs performed informally on acoustic guitar and vocals by Richie and Candice. Also included is a half hour documentary where the duo discusses the making of the album, individual tracks, and other facts related to Blackmore's Night.<br /><br />\\"Dancer and the Moon\\" is another outstanding release by Blackmore's Night with something to please the rainbow spectrum of their fans. From earthy Renaissance reverie to rousing rock, there is something for everyone. In a previous review I compared elements of Blackmore's Night's sound to aspects of Jethro Tull, and with this album featuring more electric guitar, the comparison is still apt in certain respects. Although the elegant vocals of Candice Night put Blackmore's Night in a league of its' own. Fan's of Richie's soaring Stratocaster who wanted to hear more of it in the music will certainly be happy - I know I am. And those who love the group's more traditional acoustic fare will find a nice balance of that on Dancer and the Moon as well.  Despite the wide variety of influences in their sound, or possibly because of it, the group has managed to build a huge following around the world, showing that there is a market for original music that breaks the mold of standard radio fare. And that is something Blackmore's Night does in grand style.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I liked the Third Season very well. I am looking forward to Season Four. I will purchase Four as soon as it is available.
B002UNMW7O|4.0|good movie full of action comedy and guns  if you loved the first one you will like this one  no brainer
B007ZD17XO|4.0|I really did enjoy playing to start with but I have problems with my right hand and I guess I can't play it fast enough to get past the level I am on now. I think others would enjoy playing better than me.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|even though i never watched the TV series Firefly, this was still a great movie to watch. too bad the show was canx
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you like &#34;Subway Surfers&#34; or &#34;Temple Run&#34; then you'll love Despicable Me: Minion Rush. If you are a fan of the movie, you will enjoy this app as well. You run and run and run some more and like Subway Surfers you get power-ups like Gru's Rocket or the Banana Splitter which doubles your bananas which you collect in the game. There are tasks that you can do, for example, small Villain battles or run a certain amount of meters. My only concern is that the game freezes occasionally on my Kindle Fire but it isn't that bad. Overall, I would recommend this game to just about everyone. .....and it's FREE!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app really is one of the best apps I've seen: it's funny it's nice and for all ages! At first I couldn't enter the app but there's a very simple solution: just shut down your kindle fire and turn it on again (that's what I did and it worked) I highly recommend this app!
B0002KPIQY|1.0|It is disappointing when making a purchase with high expectations and then be let down. in this case I was very disappointed.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is awesome and fun. I definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun and challenging game.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|We want candy crush saga the game not a cheat guide!!!!! It's time for yal 2 stop putting these fake games up
B005LAIH2C|4.0|Although it's not a blockbuster with a high budget, it is still entertaining. The actors are pretty good and the storyline has a unique twist. The costumes are great, and it's so much better than the last (totally cheesy) version of H&G I watched on Netflix. I liked it overall.
0525478817|5.0|I ripped through this book and read it anyplace I possibly could! It made me laugh, cry (really it did), and really think life and death. After seeing how completely amazing this book is I will definitely be purchasing other John Green books!
1476727910|5.0|Wonderful novel that totally encompasses what it is to be human and possibly why we are here. Fiction crammed packed with universal truths, beautifully written.<br /><br />Also very funny and at times achingly sad.
B0060QM09M|5.0|Ever since I first read All Creatures Great And Small many years ago, I've been hooked. I have, over the years, read all of James Herriot's books and even the biography written by his son. The stories come alive in the mind and you can \\"see\\" the hills and countryside while \\"riding\\" alongside Jim Herriot in his rickety auto, and you feel as though you are right there assisting with the animals. The descriptions are so vibrant that you forget you're reading a story and you think you're actually there.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I've lost every title I've purchased through Amazon. Well, they're still there but I can no longer read OR access them through my Android phone because of the \\"new\\" Kindle Update. I've done EVERYTHING I've been told to do......unregister my app.....remove my books....redownload my books....reinstall the app....EVERYTHING they've said to do. Alas.....I still cannot read or even find my PURCHASED Kindle books in my app. Each and every thing I do, when I open the app I'm told each book is an \\"Invalid Item\\". I've really grown tired of seeing that message so I've since PAID FOR AGAIN and downloaded each title to Google Play. I can read my books and even when they UPDATE the program, you DO NOT lose your PAID FOR titles. I use to really enjoy Kindle but evidently they've decided to pay an outside (say cheaper or less intelligent) company to come up with an \\"UPDATE\\" that they never really checked to see if it worked before its' release. Hopefully, the bean counters at Amazon have NOT sent the check to the bank for the latest UPDATE. They are screwed if they did.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|This is the best mahjong app. that I have found. Lots of different levels. Choose from many different backgrounds and playing designs. In a word. AWESOME.
B005LAII80|4.0|No silly Stallone nonsense, just straight action, well made. Urban is perfect as Judge Dredd, the story teases just enough of the world out to make you interested in learning more but never leaving you feeling lost.<br /><br />Now I'm just sad I didn't get a chance to see it before it disappeared from theatres.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|did the free version all the to the&quot;HERO&quot; level before it wouldn't let me play anymore (even though I still had 6 days of play left) so of course I had to buy the full version to start at the beginning again. I recommend if you like challenging match 3 games!
B001R10BEG|2.0|I bought this movie with the title 'Like New' and it was not. I recieved this a day before the delivery estimate which I am happy about, but the case was broke. I had to put it it in a new one. I love this movie, but the seller was awful due to the condition of the case.
B00127RAJY|3.0|This work out is good. Level one is too easy so I had to step it up right away. I didn't lose any weight at all but it did make me sweat and I feel like it is helpful. I had to add running into the mix because it wasn't long enough for me and even with the running I haven't lost any weight. I actually gained like 5 lbs...yes I know what your going to say. I hear it all the time ITS MUSCLE! I guess I'll look like Chyna before I know it :( I have fat...that needs to go. I know I do, so I am pushing through it hoping one day it will decide to go away.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|It's a bag made for SLR Camera and accessories... There's no surprise as to what you'll receive, and the quality is quite nice. No complaints about the product at all. Very spacious and holds items well.
B009AMANBA|5.0|My mother really wanted to see this in the theater, but she never leaves the house, so I purchased it for her so she could watch it at home.  Actually I asked her if she watched it, and she said no not yet.  I asked her why?  She said because I don't know how to work the VCR (actually its a DVD). Ok she used to know how, so I'm gonna go over and watch it with her soon.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The wife and I played with our 5 year old and had a blast. We could hardly put it down...very addicting.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Dragonvale is an epic game for kindle fire. With so many updates and great graphics. My favorite part of this game would have to be trying to figure out which dragon your making. It adds to the suspence of it all. I would recommend this game to everyone out there who likes games like dragonvale. 10 out of 5 stars!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I got this game ad I really liked it but as i got higher into the levels I needed more pearls. things didn't go my way since I didn't purchase more pearls. I just wish I was allowed to buy more pearlsnafter spending 8 bucks on pearls. other than that similar to ice age village and a lot of money and counting involved love the corlas and fish. pretty.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|It's an easy book, quite predictable. It reminds me of Sandra Brown's style. I enjoyed the funny aspects of it (the inner goddess of the main character).
B0090P98Z4|4.0|Good to pass the time and is good to blow of stream the blade work looks good and this game is good for those rainy days
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is one of the best puzzle mystery games I have ever played<br />You should buy this app if your into mystery and puzzle sort of games I can now see why it has a 5 star average rating
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|When I saw this album I knew I had to have it but what I didn't expect was how emotional I was going to get while listening to it. I love all the songs but again I had no idea it was going to take me on a roller coaster ride of emotions. I have enjoy listening to this album when I need a pick me up but then I know that if I play it to many times I will start to get sad and cry. I make sure the my emotions are in check before I play or else the water works will start. Thanks Whitney for all the good memories.
B0023SDPS6|4.0|Craig Johnson develops a good chemistry among his flawed and interesting characters.  I like that the characters are similar but not identical to the TV series.  I look forward to reading the rest of the series.
B00BWC1UZE|3.0|When I first heard the album straight threw I was not happy with what I heard but now it's been a couple of months and it's a decent album. Maybe when the first year anniversary of the album comes around I will call it's wonderful or even great but right not I'm still getting use to it. Sorry JT it's not my cup of tea maybe for round 2 you will have a knockout.
B006YM9JSW|5.0|A good price for an excellent product. It offers the power and stability that my new computer have. Great for Intel
B00BQ1DBUS|2.0|I was surprised at this album, He usually does very good songs, These were not my type of songs was not impressed
B000V6BE6M|5.0|Beautiful presentation, for the good one fanatic. Always want to have this product because there are musical pieces that the original soundtrack doesn't include. I adore this product
B00908DDZM|5.0|I am not a huge R&B/Rap but I really like Macklemore & Ryan Lewis's CD. The music and the lyrics are well written, they make you want to dance, I think he might be one of the best artist out there right now and for his future music to come.
B000BNI90O|5.0|Beautiful presentation, for the good one fanatic. Always want to have this product because there are musical pieces that the original soundtrack doesn't include. I adore this product
B00D23K0MU|5.0|Instant classic! Blue Velvet Soul is outstanding. This CD is in heavy rotation on my ipad. The incomparable Ms. Maysa Leak never disappoints!
B00BUAEYVK|4.0|Willis still has &#34;it&#34; in this typical Die Hard - and it is what we have come to expect and want it is full of action and adventure - and of course -- everything gets blown up!
B0095MVOMC|2.0|I learned via a response to my earlier review that the warning produced by Avast and a few other virus protection applications had been a \\"false positive\\". This was later verified by the updated definitions which permitted installation on my daughter's device.<br /><br />Since that time, I installed Hidden Numbers on both my daughter's and my devices. My daughter uses the Kindle Fire version 1. I am using and HTC One S.<br /><br />My summary:<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Stable on HTC One S<br />Skills required to play are easily mastered (touching targets, menu navigation)<br />Graphics / image design are moderately interesting and user-friendly<br />Game play is well suited as a brief distraction during short breaks<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Does not run on Kindle Fire version 1<br />Game play deviates from purpose of relevant skills exercise<br />Capacity for replay interest is low<br />Asking price is high<br /><br />The application did not successfully run on my daughter's device. However, I have consistently run the game on the HTC without issue.<br /><br />The game play is as one would expect: a game featuring various images in which are hidden 25 numbers. It's a very quick concept to master for any who may be new to this type of puzzle. Given that this game may be played on a phone, perhaps as a diversion during a short break, it is aptly suited. The typical time to play a given frame may average 1 - 2 minutes.<br /><br />Given the purpose of a puzzle / game of this variety being an exercise of one's ability to recognize symbols and patterns in varying contexts, I felt that this game deviated from the mark. Overall, the difficulty seems to be somewhat flat after a slight increase following the first few frames. But, what seems to be a marker for any increase that exists is that the numbers seem to become smaller with what seems to be increasing quantity out of the total number targets. So, the difficulty seems to rely less upon being difficult to find due to being cleverly hidden. Instead it is simply making the numbers too small to be seen. On a phone-sized screen, regardless which model, this just seems to deviate from \\"the rules\\" a bit. I'd call that an undesirable method.<br /><br />The frames appear to be fixed, in that returning to a given frame won't provide new arrangements of number targets. So the replay interest is pretty low. I don't think I will play more than once. My estimate is that I will lose interest in playing the game at all after completing not more than 25 frames.<br /><br />This brings me to the asking price for such a game. As a FAOTD, it is a good purchase. When asking $1.99, I think that price is well outside the realm of acceptable, and this is really based in the capacity to garner interest with the audience to play more than once. I just disagree with the idea that a game is \\"disposable\\" when an investment is made.<br /><br />It may be a challenging thing to define in terms of retail value, but there may be some comparisons offered with typical entertainment options which share some common characteristics: a movie rental may be $3 or so. There is about 90 minutes to the average feature length film, and it is essentially a disposable \\"experience\\" (even if memorable). On the high end, and assuming the movie is viewed only once, that makes for about 3 cents per minute of engagement.<br /><br />This application is listed at $1.99. With 50 total frames, and assuming 2 minutes per frame, the application runs about 2 cents per minute of engagement, with almost no sustainable audience when completed, with the exception of small children.<br /><br />Granted, the two types of entertainment are substantially different. Our comparisons could get to be very scientific and detailed as there are many elements we could consider, not the least of which being the target demographic. If we consider this to be a game intended for small children, the numbers change remarkably. We would need to account for thetendency of kids to repeat both movies and games, even when neither would provide challenging concepts.<br /><br />If I were to purchase this game for my daughter, I think a fair asking price would be less than $1, probably close to 50 cents.
B003PAXOPU|5.0|ive never seen this configuration for sale, so i was very excited to get this home. love the movie and was a very nice addition to my collection. was a fantastic value at this price.
1843106698|5.0|I found this book a good research based and helpful.  It is a great resource that I can use to at work with applied techniques and tips.
B004YXE438|4.0|Good variety of pictures to choose from. I really like that I can choose the level of difficulty. This is a great one to have for anyone who loves puzzles.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Great. when. it works. Last update crashed my account, but if it fixed the issues. It is an awesome game. Only bad part, it is addictive.
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|I love fantasy novels and stumbled upon this book while looking for a fun summer read.  This is really a good adaptation of the Cinderella story.  There are some parts that are a bit ridiculous, but that what fantasy is all about.  The story was slow and repetitive in a few sections, but Meyer has an easy writing style that makes for a quick read.  I would recommend it.
0143120530|5.0|Technology enables companies to offer free storage to store stuff, last I heard, up to 1 TB per user.  \\"Is there such a capacity for humans to remember everything?\\"  More importantly, can our brain retrieve the information?<br /><br />This is a true story of a journalist in his journey into the finals of US Memory Championships.  In the championships, among many things, it tests the ability to remember names, numbers, people, cards using variety of techniques such as memory palace, intensive reading.  The true story covers a variety of memory techniques; and enriched by a parallel documentation of the history of memory management from internal to external media; intertwined with the stories of a few unusual human beings.<br /><br />This is a story of \\"what one could achieve with commitment\\" and \\"the history of memory management\\".<br /><br />The author provides content and flavor; and tells the story in both a personal and professional manner.  He turns a seemingly dry topic into a very enjoyable read.  Not to mention that the reader grasps a few useful techniques to remember better.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good read, or ways to reverse your perception of failing memory, check this out, and I hope you would enjoy the read as much as I do.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This book is truly what a fantasy novel should be.  It has all of the whimsical elements, it's a bit scary and it's basically a psychological adventure.  It's hard to know what really happened during this man's childhood.  Is this whole walk-down-memory-lane a fantasy that he dreamed up during a troubled childhood?  Or did these things really happen?  It's hard to say, but it's a fun and easy read.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Love this game. It's cute and fun. Play it all the time. My little girl plays as well. Love the mini games as well
B005723JSQ|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and I didn't have a problem with the footnotes on the Kindle at all.  I found them easy to navigate back and forth and didn't mind the footnotes at all. The story itself is incredibly funny.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Like the other run games but omg so much fun with Minions!<br />The sounds and just plain fun! Nit much more I can say but get the app it worth free!
B000VM9Z8K|4.0|You can usually rely on Kinsella to create something funny, and this book is no exception.  This is a fun book, but you will have to suspend your understanding of human nature.  It's just unbelievable that someone would all of a sudden change her total personality and become completely fake, but then change back to her old self. The whole journey does become more interesting toward the end.  I just wish that Kinsella would have explored that a bit more.
B000P0J09W|5.0|I will never say die to this movie. It's a classic and my kids love it too. Can't go wrong here
B00B2V66VS|4.0|just like the first but better wish there were more characters and obstacles but still a fun app good for children
B004SBULWE|5.0|Great app for what it does. The widget is the best part for easy use. I use it on all my devices
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its a great way to pass the time and its a game for all ages and anyone can play and addictive
1452110581|5.0|I hesitated to make this purchase because I thought, one funny cat poem (I skimmed the first page) does not make an entire funny book, I mean how many funny poems can one person write about a cat? A lot as it turns out. I laughed out loud at every single page, anyone who has ever made a cat a part of the family can relate. The author took cute little cat quirks and made them into something hilarious. Definitely something to have around the house, it's great when you need to smile on a stressful day.
B00B7PIRIE|3.0|one disk is un playable. Season 2 disk skips and I can't play it properly. Returning is a big hassle.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|The app works well on my tablet except for one function. This function displays graphics on the home page of the weather for that day. The graphics start taking over the page until there is almost no space to display the weater information. Fortunatly there is a option to turn that fuction off. With it off the other graphics display properly.
0486278077|5.0|The book was of superb quality. It held together nicely throughout a few week trip. The novel itself is a must read classic.
0452289963|5.0|Life changing.  Eye opener.  A must read and definitely something to pass on.  I bought 6 copies just to hand out.  Need to buy more.  Ran out super fast.
B00B84652O|5.0|First, I'm going to confess, I don't have prior issues of any of these CDs or their vinyl counterparts to offer an A/B comparison here.  I'll leave that to more tenacious folks.<br /><br />This box is a slightly classier older brother to the \\"Original Album Classics\\" sets that are flooding the market right now.  With those, you get essentially a paper slipcase with five (or so) cardboard album sleeves that emulate old vinyl sleeves (provided they weren't gatefold).  No inner sleeves to protect the discs from the coardboard they're packaged in, no booklets, no liners, no frills.  The trade-off is understood to be the lower prices (if you're buying them from the right outlets or keeping an eye out for a price dip on Amazon).<br /><br />With this Roadrunner box, the contents are the same, but the outer box is a heavier card stock clamshell-style box which, sadly, would have had plenty of room to include even a compiled reprint of the liner books that came with the original cds.  A minor gripe, yeah, but it still feels like a missed opportunity.  Pleasantly, even though the discs are only in cardboard sleeves, the artwork as reprinted on them is vibrant and colorful, not washed out or clearly photocopied from some second hand source.<br /><br />On the subject of the music, it's King Diamond.  What else is there to say?  Included herein are Fatal Portrait (1986), Abigail (1987), \\"Them\\" (1988), Conspiracy (1989), and \\"The Eye\\" (1990).  As near as I can tell, this is regarded as a \\"classic\\" era for the man and this phase of his backing band.  For better or worse, there's nothing to indicate if this stuff has been remastered, when it was remastered, or if it's just re-pressings of the original CD issues.  The only thing I CAN say with certainty is that the bonus materials from the reissues of \\"Them\\" and Conspiracy I used to have are completely absent.  They were just rehearsal recordings, so I won't be carrying widows' weeds over it, but it is one definite difference between these and the last batch of issues.<br /><br />It should be mentioned that, remastered or not, what I've listened to on these discs has sounded phenomenal in my car.  I'm not picking up on any loudness wars \\"push it to the limit\\" remastering, so I suspect these are either original issues or some of the classiest remasterings I've heard in a while.  Whichever it may be, you can't argue with \\"It sounds good!\\"<br /><br />When I picked this up, I got it for around $3 per disc.  The missing documentation and simple (if classy) packaging aside, you can't argue with a price like that.  Having a Roadrunner Exec drive past and throw one at you is about the only way you'll get it cheaper.  So, while it may not be the high hand or last word in memorable physical product, it's a great way if, like me, you dig what you've heard by King Diamond but didn't want to shell out a lot of money to dig deeper.<br /><br />If nothing else, I can definitely say I'll be checking out other sets in this release series to catch up with bands I missed out on the first time around.n these and the last batch of issues.<br /><br />It should be mentioned that, remastered or not, what I've listened to on these discs has sounded phenomenal in my car.

B0026P3G12|5.0|Everything was good with this purchase.  Amazon sent it quickly and I am enjoying the CD.  I researched through the internet for a good purchase price.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I'm very glad that I read the book. Everything about it was great. The one thing I didn't like was prim dying.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This app is very good to keep you up to date on the weather! Great graphics, and ease of use.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Had this app for months with no issues. Now since they updated it, it is bogged down with junk ads eating up screen space
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|Volbeat are a great band with a sound that's hard to describe parts hard rock, rockabilly and metal with a great sense of melody at all times. all these styles show up on outlaw gentlemen and shady ladies. The singer has to be mentioned first because to me he is one of the biggest things that makes volbeat stand out while his voice isn't the most technical in the buiseness I find it highly enjoyable and unique. The other members of the band are no slouches either creating some great music. Some of my favorite tracks are lonesome rider featuring female vocals as well this track is absolutely addictive the female vocals complementing the male vocals perfectly. The sinner is you is another one of my favorite songs sure its more radio oriented than some of the rest but that doesn't mean it isn't a great song it is. The nameless one and the hangman's body count are great songs as well they have more of a metal vibe to them. Doc holiday is a great song as well and probably the heaviest on the cd. In closing anyone looking for a unique and enjoyable metal or even just musical experience in general should at least give outlaw gentlemen and shady ladies a listen.
0061148512|4.0|I originally read this in college-at about the same age as the protagonist here. I felt every emotion as my own as I was in a dark phase, which the passage of time eventually got me out of. No matter the time-period, I think many adolescent girls on the cusp of adulthood go through these difficult passages. Sadly, Plath did not seem to get past this phase. The feelings here are laid out bare. And this is, perhaps, why this book is still so meaningful, especially to those who are going through their own dark passage. Recommend.
B005ILYW1E|3.0|It was a decent action flick with killing, chasing, etc.  I guess the thing that bugged me is that there is no way the cops let the Blitz go after arresting him.<br /><br />He has the $50k that he took off the junkie he killed with him when he's arrested.  That's more than enough to arrest him for at least one account of murder.  And all the evidence they need is in his house, which for some reason they just don't search.<br /><br />I know Statham movies aren't known for being the most realistic.  But if you're going to make a cop movie, you should at least have it make sense.
B003QP4BJM|5.0|Very nice and digestable economic, social, cultural and genetic evolution facts that make you think how different our life has become in the last few years and whats to become.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved it!!!!!! I was surprised about Jo, that was shock.... Alex's late wife helping him find love again with Katie
B0091REZMW|3.0|I've only played for a short time and will most likely wait for updates to the font size. I really struggle reading the words on my 8inch Kindle. Otherwise I would probably enjoy this game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Good times. Nice graphics. It's exciting to play at any age. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys run games
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it is such a great game, I really have enjoyed playing so far. a thinking game and a good brain challenge
0788859544|5.0|Since a child I loved this movie. Amazon gave great deals in this items plus more. It was in perfect condition and came at great timing. I loved my overall experience.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I am enjoying this new game, epic. Love the game, very enjoyable, enjoy the villages,  I really like the battles as well as earning points<br />,
B0062QRTKA|5.0|Not being a \\"hard-core\\" gamer, I like my games uncomplicated and fun.  This game delivers very well on both counts.  The cartoon-like graphics are actually my favorite part of the game; I inevitably find myself grinning like a Chesire while I'm playing because everything is just so darned cute. Game play is easy to understand and accomplish. The game loaded quickly to my KFHD and I've had no problems with it whatsoever.  There are no dubious permissions and no ads to spoil the flow of fun.<br /><br />Open Sea!(Go Down Mo!) has given me nothing but smiles and I can honestly say it's my favorite Kindle game.  If the Pixelizers continue to create junk-free, adorably fun games such as this one, I will definitely be a repeat customer.
B002413TY2|4.0|Jason Statham is back as Frank Martin, the Transporter, in this explosive third installment of the action-adventure series. This time, Frank is presented an offer he can't refuse and ends up with a mysterious passenger and a dangerous destination - calling for a new machine and new rules. The stakes are bigger, the enemy is deadlier, and the action has never been hotter.  Keeps holding my interest, action is never ending.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. I was stuck doing nothing intill minion rush cam along .I have such a good time playing this exiting game.
B004XWLIJS|4.0|Arthur Bishop is an elite professional assassin. A job that requires perfection and total detachment.<br /><br />But when his mentor and close friend Harry (Donald Sutherland) is murdered, Bishop is anything but detached. He wants those responsible dead. His mission grows complicated when Harry's son (Ben Foster) approaches him with the same vengeful goal and a determination to follow in Bishop's footsteps. Ben was a quick study but just not so keen minded as Arthur.<br /><br />The film was very exciting, lots of action. Really like Jason Statham. He is so aloof and cool.

B00333NCTM|5.0|This book went over a lot of things that was already told. I thought it could have been a little better. Dizzy as as funny but some what boring.
B005FWPSPK|4.0|You can hear the sonic detail on this heavy vinyl that's missing on the cd. The vinyl is quiet and flat. The box it comes in is well designed. The photo booklet contributes little, some photos showing the band in drag. No lyrics, articles, or technical data are included. The bonus tracks on the other discs which are included range from good to I'll never play it again. They could have just not included this stuff and lowered the $115 price tag and I would have been very happy to give it 5 stars. But, it's still great to hear U2's finest album in this format.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great and awesome game. Really glad it's on the kindle. And over all the best. Need more games like this.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I liked it  not as good as the first but I liked it in my opinion it is a 4 star rating. Must read after the first.

B00A4FOWYQ|4.0|There were quite a few raised eyebrows when Tegan and Sara released this album at the beginning of this year, as it marks a clear/radical departure from the twin sisters' earliest albums (they had hinted already on more recent albums such as \\"The Con\\" and in particular on \\"Sainthood\\" that they wanted to evolve their sound). Hard to believe but Tegan and Sara have been at it for 15 years already, and this is their 8th studio album.<br /><br />\\"Heartthrob\\" (10 tracks; 36 min.) opens with \\"Closer\\" and it immediately hits you that the sound is much more polished, awash with warm synthesizers. Wait, is this the same Tegan and Sara? Why, yes it is! Just in different clothes (musically speaking). As the tracks roll along, such as \\"I Was a Fool\\" and \\"Drive Me Wild\\", this is by far the most commercially assessable the Canadian twins have ever sounded. If you can get over this, the album sounds good, even great. If you are pining for the sound from 10 years ago, you will not like tis album, it's that simple. The closing track \\"Shock To Your System\\" sums it all up, lush sound, rich production, smooth all the way. Couldn't help but notice on that on the booklet containing the lyrics to the songs, the girls inserted their name ahead of two of the songs, so that it now reads Sara: \\"I'm Not Your Hero\\", and later it reads Tegan: \\"I Couldn't Be Your Friend\\". Noted!<br /><br />I have seen the girls in concert a number of times over the years, and just this weekend saw them here in Cincinnati at the Bunbury music festival, where they played to a widely enthusiastic crowd. They played a bunch from the new album (including Closer, Goodbye Goodbye, Now I'm All Messed Up, and I Was a Fool, just to name those), along with a number of older/classic tunes such as Living Room, and best of all Back In Your Head. Great show all around, and most interestingly, the new songs from \\"Heartthrob\\" sounded much better live than on the album.

1402270275|4.0|This book caught my attention when sifting through my unread e-books.  Part of the disappointment of the Kindle iPad App is that there is not a summary of the book, a place to make a notation or even a bookshelf in which to file genre.  So when I started reading this, I had no idea what to expect.<br /><br />While I like the paranormal and anachronisms (both intentional and accidental) usually amuse me, I have had my doubts about Steampunk.  Historically, I have not been partial to \\"common\\" language and was doubtful of liking an largely illiterate hero with an awful accent.  Fortunately, the different world building and Honor's character caught my interest and I read on.  Like Honor, I succumbed to Blade's charm and heart.  Most of secondary characters were well done as well.<br /><br />Others have spelled out the storyline, so I will not repeat that.  I do encourage any who doubt to give it a go.  There are some good to great indie and seasoned writers out there and I sincerely admire anyone who can conceive of a story and go the distance.  There are few 5 stars when compared to the greats on my scale. So as I have said before IMHO Amazon needs to go to a 10 star scale, to help the potential reader evaluate. But the 5 star scale probably sells more books as some would consider a 3 star review a pan.  So don't consider my 4 star review less than a vote of confidence.  Mary Stewart she is not.
1476712042|4.0|I loved this book. I didn't want it to end. Of course some of it is stupid and dramatic but isn't that what draws us all in? Anyway, I loved it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Fun,easy to learn. Maybe a few more ads than I would like,but,hey, it was free. Who could ask for more?

B00BTJMS1A|4.0|I love the fact that I can earn virtual extras!!! One thing I don't like about this game is that you only have to ways to go- up or down. if u could go up then down all in one move it would make the game even better!!!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This game is wonderful!  It realy makes you think about direction. Wish there were instructions for the direction for each throw.
B00846REIS|4.0|I chose this rating because it was kind of dragged out . The characters were good but some things were confusing.
B0095MVOMC|4.0|not a bad game - searching for numbers instead of pictures an interesting twist. the background pics good and finding the numbers just difficult enough to have some challenge without a lot of frustration. hint button works well and makes the number you are searching for quite obvious. overall an average search game that I will keep until I complete all the levels (should take a day or so of intermittent playing) nice faotd - would not pay more then .99 for it. downloaded and played fine on my first gen kindle.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I never get tired of this game. I try to play it every chance I can. This is the best app on my Kindle Fire!!!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Wish there were more levels. Each level was a bit of fun. I can not wait for more levels to come.
B00B5D2V7G|5.0|An absolutely fantastic show that will never run dry. Why? Because every season is it's own story and is written beautifully with an amazing set of actors (Jessica Lange, Evan Peters, and Zachary Quinto are my favorites). However, people should remember that this isn't a family show, and sex is a major theme throughout both of the seasons that are out so far, so don't go showing it to your seven year olds because they might be scarred for life.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Could not put it down and was disappointed when it ended. An overall good book and an over all good author
B005G02RIC|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the presentation of Tosca.  Splendid singing, fine acting and excellent videography.  For the first time, I can see what the fuss over Blu-ray is all about.
B005K17RU0|2.0|Was fine until they lost transmission; did not return within a few days so am deletiing it. Kept saying it would be fixed but was not.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I am again amazed at how skillfully Hosseini converge his story lines and in the process tear my heart out. His novels are the most emotionally charged I have ever read, and I both love him and hate him for it.
0143113100|4.0|My husband recently had a stroke and I needed to learn if and how he will recover his language skills.  This book is an amazing tutorial on the current state of brain research.  What's being learned about the brain is encouraging to those who battle handicaps.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This isn't a world-ending, SMERSH-level threat, but is rather a very well conceived character piece. It expands Bond as a person (along with many of the other characters), and deepens Craig's participation as second only to Connery (and only barely).
B000FBJHZS|5.0|Best Dan Brown book. Highly recommended. Great job DBA wish I could give you a High five! Keep up the great work you are a beast.
B00CGPPMKU|3.0|This was one of the freebie daily apps that Amazon offers. Yes I love it as a novelty. It have no value except its a nice app to make designs with.
B0062OCNAI|5.0|I cannot be happier to have made the decision to read this book. Although not usually the type of book I might choose, I found it amazing. I couldn't stop reading as the author took me on this heartwarming  and heartbreaking journey with her.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Why post a review at 3:50 in the morning? Wool is THAT amazing. I've read the omnibus edition in 6 days. And, to be honest, I had the obsessive need to immediately purchase the next in the Silo Series: Shift.<br /><br />Anyone can read this book; everyone should read this book. Wool can easily be read by male and female audiences, equally, which I think is a quality that has come to define Gen Y literature. Even greater than the gender equality in voices and richly developed characters with authentic voices is the ability for the series to be read by avid Sci-Fi fans, readers new to Sci-Fi, and by any adult generation (Would you read this to elementary students out loud during a reading marathon? Um, No.). I cannot imagine a single target audience not enjoying this book series. I can't wait for it to come out in print format so I can share it with family members that do not have e-readers. I feel that the first part of the book, which started off as a short story, will become mandatory high school reading soon. I can easily see my children coming home 10 years from now with a Prentice-Hall e-textbook containing the original Wool short story.<br /><br />Your fellow Amazon.Com customers are telling you the truth. Wool deserves 5 stars.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|I could not put it down! Something Blue is an absolutely wonderful book and a must read for sure! Giffin knock one out of the park!
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|I thought about giving this the title of 'When the Music is Dying&#34;.  It is a sad story, because the people  portrayed are talented, some world reknown, and they  are losing their abilities to create the beautiful music they formerly did.<br />It's a story that every one eventually lives through, but most of us are not as talented as these people, Younger people likely will not enjoy the movie as much as older ones, .unless they are lovers of classical music and opera.<br />The story involves a group of retired musicians and singers who live in a retirement home especially for their profession.  A gala to raise mioney for a new roof is being planned, a kind of geriatric Mickey Rooney-Judy Garland story.. Much bickering and back-biting goes on about who was the best singer, there is tension and hurt feelings from former romances and love affairs,<br />All ends well with the gala performed to great success.  Maybe not a great plot, but many good scenes, great actors, and direction, and wonderful, marvelous music.!!  I have watched it three times in the few weeks I've had it, and expect to view it again and again.  I LOVE IT!!!!
B009B8YZIK|4.0|I enjoyed Forward Unto Dawn. I've not been a religious halo fan. However, I did enjoy this live action series about the Halo Universe. Unlike most video games that focus on the protagonist in the video game series, Forward Unto Dawn takes a different approach. The main character is a supporting character from the video game allowing the authors the creative freedom to write a good story.
B009K916ZK|5.0|This is perfect and a good price to adapt an old VGA monitor to your new Mac. I love it.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|A great super-hero action movie. If you're in it for major story development, or consistency with the comics, then you wont enjoy it as much as someone who just wants some entertainment.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have read the crossfire series several times, and each time the books get better!! I can't wait to see what comes next for Eva and Gideon.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Great CD with many great songs.  Everything when well with the seller and shipping.  No problems.  I've purchased many CD through Amazon and I have always been satisfied.
B008TMA1LY|3.0|you need money to really play this game that is kind of annoying to be honest. I would make parental control is on
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use for organizing my professional ideas and tasks. Love this program! It's nice to pull my ideas up no matter what computer/phone is in front of me.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I can't stop playing this game. I be on it for hours. This a really excellent game. You would really enjoy the game.
0345528581|5.0|My son loves to go to the gym but he isn't working for the summer so he can't afford to pay for a membership.........I see him in the living room doing all the different exercises from the book and challenging himself.........he says it is a  workout for sure!
B008LZHA3G|4.0|Dylan still does fantastic stuff-- like the title song/poem of this album--but don't expect anything<br />like Blood on the Tracks.  Lyrics lack the creativity of his early work
B000J5XS3C|5.0|I wouldn't recommend it for anything high powered or professional sound. I use it for practicing, wiring my instrument and my computer into it so I can mix appropriately and learn my songs more comfortably. Very ideal for that. I also sometimes use it for monitoring my mix at live shows when I don't have floor monitors or a wireless setup.
B001HN6922|5.0|My 2yr old boy loved part1 so much I decided to order  Cars2 and it is even better because I even enjoyed watching it and I felt like a kid again
B005LAIIKI|5.0|This film is an instant classic!  Superb acting, engaging dialogue, and superfluous action scenes combine to make this one my favorite of all his films.  Despite access to streaming and premium cable channels I had to have this in my permanent collection!  If you order the Blu-ray it's like watching the movie for the first time, as you will be able to fully appreciate the meticulousness that went into the film's production.
B000002KIK|3.0|I love the title track, but the rest of the album shows that the mighty Black Sabbath was starting to lose its power over the metal audience. Thankfully, the next few albums with Dio ramped it up again.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|Very informative and enjoyable DVD.  Have always enjoyed the Eagles music but did not know a lot of history behind the group until I watched this DVD.
1401324649|5.0|Hilarious book! I really enjoyed reading this story, I laughed all my way through the book. Highly recommended for a light, fun, clean read.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|this game is the game for kids!its so so fun and it keeps them busy too so that is why me like this game!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Just started the game and it's a lot of fun so far. Will post another review after I get further into the game.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I can't believe it has taken me almost a year to watch this for the first time but I loved every moment, song, and &#34; A Ca&#34; references in this movie. Pitch Perfect for me is simply a great movie. Oscar worthy? No, but simply a great movie that I can watch over and over again because of its cast and musical talents. It has the good beats and the comic relief. After I watched it for the first time, I was so happy that it was not one of those high school guilty pleasure movies. This movie takes place during college (best four years of anyone's life) and it never loses any momentum. Anna Kendrick?! I would never have guessed that she has a ca-awesome singing voice after watching her in the Twilight saga. Rebel Wilson, classic funny. I would continue with all the actors/actresses but that would take forever to write.  I don't think you would regret purchasing or renting this movie.
1878424319|5.0|This book is very well done and valuable.<br /><br />It's perfect for beginners. It explains the basics for personal philosophies and beliefs.  Anyone interested in meditation and private spirituality this is a great place to start.<br /><br />This is also a great read for anyone experienced, who wants to refresh the basics.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Second time reading it and it got better.  Love the fantasy created by the characters and the mystery of the magic.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Great game! I'm addicted to it and it builds on the movie. And it's free! Does Marvel have more games like this?
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Have tried this game and 1 other by G5 and I enjoy them. I figured there was a catch to being &quot;free&quot; but the demo is fairly decent in length, so it's worth a try. Will look into purchasing my first full game soon to see if the their series of games is worth the $5 per title. Crossing my fingers and hoping for the best!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Suzanne Collins has delivered the second part of this series with superb description. The story is easy to follow, however it hints at being depressing. She does develop the character of Katnis very convincingly that I do feel a keen sense of the need to slap Katnis for being so stupid sometimes :)<br /><br />All in add, it is a worthy read, sucks you into a very believable distopia and makes you want to turn all the pages till you're done!
0812550706|5.0|This book is excellent.  I'm 34 years old and should have read this 20 years ago.  I'm going to give it to my 11 year old for his birthday.<br />The writing is plain and clear and above all gripping. I absolutely devoured this book.
B0095MVOMC|1.0|AVG found a piece of malware in this program.<br />Be careful, this could cause you some issues, I would not trust it!
B0054XOMX4|5.0|My Grandson has around 10 or so Beyblades but this one is unbeatable in bey battles.  I don't know how it does it.  I just know that it has never lost a challenge.  If you want to be the Bey champion buy this Beyblade.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addicting and fun. This game is kinda like temple run but it is a little easier and funner. It takes you on a world tour, so far I have been to Japan and Miami. This is the best game you'll ever find!
B007C3TVNA|5.0|This is a must see! It keeps you on the edge wanting more. You will not believe how this drama ends.
0062255657|5.0|The Ocean at the End of the Lane is a beautifully creepy modern fairy tale for adults. Neil Gaiman has reminded me (again) why he is my favorite author. Gaiman weaves his words so delicately even dealing with the major theme of good vs. evil. There is a young boy of 7, that come to think of it, I don't believe is ever named... oh well, it really doesn't even matter! I felt so much empathy for this little boy! It all starts when a man commits suicide in his father's car right at the end of the lane...where the Hempstocks live. There are three women that live in the Hempstock household, Lettie Hempstock, her mother Ginnie and the grandmother Old Mrs. Hempstock. These three women hold so many secrets and I found myself flipping pages like a madwoman to try to figure them out. Anyways, Lettie befriends the young boy and the two of them get into all kinds of trouble.<br /><br />All of the characters were written brilliantly in my opinion. Ursala Monkton has got to be one of the creepiest, freakiest evil things ever. Wow! It's so hard not to put spoilers in this review!<br /><br />The story was also brilliant. Brilliant, brilliant, effing brilliant. The imagination, creativity and originality of Gaiman is stunning in this work.  The thing I liked most about this book is how it teaches us to have faith in the good people. Whenever the young boy is scared of everything in his world, he can still rely on the Hempstocks. They have and will always be there for him, even if he doesn't even know it himself.<br /><br />I absolutely recommend this book to anyone that loves a wicked fairy tale.<br /><br />5 stars to The Ocean at the End of the Lane!
B00622D3BS|4.0|Even though this movie may be considered a &#34;chic flick&#34;, I was still able to enjoy it. Steve Carell always makes me laugh; that Ryan guy had his moments.  Overall, this was a good movie.
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|Candy Crush is it #1 game going-why don't u have the app yet. Candy Crush is awesome! love the game...lets play!
B006UIUJ2A|2.0|Why write this book about North Korea? Is it based on some truth or all fiction. If fiction why run down a nation in such a disturbing way? Why not make this story about America? If there is some truth then God help the people of this country.
B00DU74U74|4.0|I was not sure how this would turn out since I had read the book, AND taking into consideration how bad the other book to movies of Stephanie Meyers had turned out, but it wasn't bad.<br /><br />They could have done better like different actress for the End for the Wanderer,but that is of course eye of the beholder type of thing, and there were other things that they cut out that would have made the movie better,such as the ending, but all in all it was good, if you like this type of movie.<br /><br />Some people might think of it as a slow movie. Such as people had thought of Hunger Games (another epic fail from book to movie, Then again, that depends on your taste. :)
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|I  liked. It  until  the  game stopped just after  I  got to level 20  with 22 dinos and 5 fish. Was enjoying the challenge of the game.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Cheryl takes us on a personal journey and a physical adventure with vivid description and raw humanity.  I enjoy her as an author immensely.
B00DU73T08|2.0|It is a good story that did not get translated well on film. Now I know why I never even heard of it until it showed up for rental.
B008NMT684|4.0|Easy and simple for my 2.5 yr old loves it specially cuz he koves the theme of game the clapping and balloon
0792844890|5.0|No Mel Brooks collection is complete with out this movie.<br />Great cast and typical crazy story......could not be any better.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the best game ever.it's got humor ( video) hard parts ( Victor battle) and the game gets harder and harder when you get further and further.This is truly a great game
B006M4F67A|4.0|Challenging, nice graphics; speed is not required. Relaxing, several puzzles to solve. Get three star ratings for each puzzle instead of reading about the \\"stars\\".<br />Great for waiting rooms and commutes.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Yup to get to find the chainsaw type of duty black and don the chainsaws and its first year of meatballs read the chainsaw to get

B000FBFN1U|5.0|One of the best book series ive read, and this one is the best of the three, each one is better than the last, and they all are awesome
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love the app it is amzan and addictive so hard to stop playing I hope u in joy the app
B0095MVOMC|3.0|First off, I give this app 3 stars because personally, I found the hidden numbers were sometimes too difficult to locate due to the zooming limitations of the game. It also didn't seem like touch controls were always sensitive enough --- sometimes I'd have to tap the number multiple times to get the game to recognize I'd located the number.<br /><br />Secondly, this app DOES NOT contain malware. People who are posting that this app has malware are only saying that because their Kapersky or Avast app raised an alarm, but Kapersky and Avast send up the same alarm for adware and bloatware as for \\"malware\\", which are actual viruses and trojans. Kapersky and Avast are wrong to do this, because there's a BIG difference between adware/bloatware and malware.<br /><br />Adware and bloatware are apps and programs that provide some kind of game or other function, but also push ads or gather non-sensitive data (e.g., app usage history, browser history, etc.) to be used for marketing purposes. Viruses and trojans steal sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers, passwords, etc.), do actual damage to data and devices, and secretly copy themselves to other devices and accounts as often and as quickly as possible. You may feel that your app usage and browser history are \\"sensitive\\" data too, but nobody can use that information to steal money from you, do damage to your data or device, or access your online accounts without your permission. THAT'S the difference.<br /><br />Considering that pretty much ANY app that runs leaderboards or allows players to connect and play against each other online, or connect to some central website or server online for any reason, is gathering at least a *little* data on users, and apps that are always free typically push ads as a way for the developer to make money (as opposed to just charging something for the app), maybe 70% or more of apps could technically be classified as adware or bloatware. But that doesn't mean many of them aren't fun or useful, and on a tablet, stopping the ads or data gathering is as simple as turning off your wifi connection.<br /><br />People with Kindle Fires *really* don't have to worry about viruses at all at this point, as I recently posted in this article on my site, dmediamom dot com: Kindle Fire Antivirus: You Still Don't Need It.<br /><br />I wish Kapersky and Avast would stop misleading people and getting them all up in a lather over something that's a non-issue.ul, and on a tablet, stopping the ads or data gathering is as simple as turning off your wifi connection.<br /><br />People with Kindle Fires *really* don't have to worry about viruses at all at this point, as I recently posted in this article on my site, dmediamom dot com: Kindle Fire Antivirus: You Still Don't Need It.<br /><br />I wish Kapersky and Avast would stop misleading people and getting them all up in a lather over something that's a non-issue.
B0030B621W|4.0|This is a brilliant science fiction story.  The acting and production levels are high.  This is science fiction suspense as opposed to action.  You won't be disappointed!
B00A81MV3U|5.0|This movie deals with a difficult subject matter.  Does not do all the typical Hollywood stuff with mental illness.  Portrays a very realistic story.
