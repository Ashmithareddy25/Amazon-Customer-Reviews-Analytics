B00CGPPMKU|3.0|Very nice to have free apps, as long as they work.  This one usually works but occasionally the menu is inconsistent: attempts to close the menu close the whole program, and most recently the menu disappeared and there's no way to erase the picture without uninstalling and reinstalling.
B00846WWVM|4.0|The basic principle of the game is simple: put out the fire. However the graphics of the water and the attention to details such as the animations of the water droplets make this game stand out from all the other mini games. Really worth a try.
B0016BP0PW|5.0|Unusual current musical to the big screen.  Well done with the actors singing Beatle's songs along with the script.  Really enjoyed it's setting in the late sixties.  Really nothing new as far as music and style came of the nineties and the new millennium so it's fun to watch a time which still sets the standards for these modern times.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It's a great series to watch.  You don't have to worry about inappropriate language or sexual undertones.  There's enough excitement and unpredictable moments to keep you watching from one episode to the next.
B005LAII44|5.0|I enjoyed how they flowed the story and how they handled the characters within the story.  These are always fun to watch anyway so it was an extra to actually enjoy the storyline.
B005S9EKCW|3.0|A bit confusing at times, unless you know the story.  The actors and actresses were well chosen for their parts.
B003THJA1G|4.0|I am late getting into the series - I do like the concept and the characters are interesting and keeps your attention.  I bought it for something to do on the plane but will buy more of the series as it keeps your attention and is not predictable.
B0000VD04M|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies, Johnny Depp as Ed Wood what a character part! You've got to give Johnny a lot of credit with this movie, dressing up in woman's clothes and loving it.  Johnny Depp is always taking the unusual parts in movies. The whole cast was great.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Despicable Me is one of the funniest movies Universal has released. I would definitely recommend to anyone that has not seen it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|The game is great, the best I found.  BUT I really hate those pop ups, some of which are very offensive.  I leave it for a while, then go back, thinking it will be better.  A good game is ruined.
B004856SQ8|3.0|I saw about 5 minutes of the ending on TV and decided I had to have this movie.  They really kept the 'isms' of the original series and added their own flavor to it.  All the main characters were enjoyable to watch and the craziness was just plain fun.
B004ZJZPZC|4.0|The music is so happy, it makes the movie.  Meryl Streep is always a joy to watch, Pierce Brosnan is eye candy, Christine  Baranski has always been a favorite of mine,and the rest of the cast was so much fun.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|This is an Android app for my tablet. I tried finding songs without the app, but it was difficult. This app gets me directly to what I what I want.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I first started watch the series on PBS, my wife and I got so stuck on it we purchased all three series. This is a beautiful story of Love  Life & Death. Watch it
B000QI2ZWW|1.0|I like a lot the convenience of watching movies on Amazon, but this rental experience was a disappointment because of a very bad quality of the video - the picture was fuzzy all the time.
1607066017|5.0|To keep it simple.  This is the best modern graphic novel I have ever read.  I can't wait for the next.
B00E8KLWB4|2.0|The game is fun but waiting for experience and energy stinks.you can buy gems and more coins but I don't want to waste my money it's okay for a free game
B009VIZDLI|5.0|If you enjoyed jack Nicholson in as good as it gets ,with Helen hunt , you will enjoy this book ,funny ,frustrating ,a good read.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I ran across this book while skimming a People Magazine, waiting for the doctor to come in and see me ... It wasn't a review, just an ad, but it had been proclaimed &#34;one of the five books every woman needs to read.&#34; I wrote it down so I wouldn't forget and when I got home, I looked it up on Amazon. A novel about teenagers ... Why should every woman read a novel about teenagers? Trust me - read it. You'll completely forget that it's categorized as &#34;young adult fiction.&#34; You'll fall in love with the characters, you'll fall in love with the story ... And as someone who doesn't cry, let me tell you - I cried. What a phenomenal novel!
B004SKHJF2|1.0|It has no purpose what so ever except to suck your wallet dry! There are better apps out there that are free!
1439190275|3.0|I bought the book, but i been reading and following the other books i have bought.... I will keep u all posted once I do.
B00C1XZ2LQ|4.0|I like the soundtrack only thing is it does repeat the main theme alot So if you don't like the main theme song you may be disappointed. But I like it.
B007SGM084|5.0|I thought that the three books were very well written and perfectly laid out for a beam primer.  Well done!!
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|This book was poorly written with characters thrown in for no good reason.  The husband's secret is telegraphed to the reader in the first pages of the book and what could have been a character study about how this affected he and his wife turned into a sloppy and depressing collision of characters with no virtue and no real purpose.  Real people don't act like these characters and there was nothing remotely entertaining or thought provoking about this story.
B007WFR0QS|3.0|like her voice. all of the songs are solid, not that many that stick out beyond that for me, but have a feeling might grow on me with further listening
B007NESBK2|5.0|I missed Sade on her 2011 tour with John Legend. This defiantly makes up for my loss. Great sound and video production. This is a must buy. Enjoy responsible.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|Reading the book was a bit slow at times but was still a good summer read.. would recommend it for those who read Ender's War
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Action was great.  Characters were interesting and interplay often witty.  Looking forward to the sequel(s).  I saw this initially in the theatre with IMAX but the Fire HD had great resolution, color.
B00E8B1P9M|1.0|I didn't care for it. My 8 year son liked it. I think it would be unfair to criticize the movie considering that the target audience was probably kids like my son. It's a kids movie.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is sooooooooo much fun!!!!I have a few of TeamLavas games,but i gotta say,this one is totally AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!I love how the dragons can never get sick or die,and i love how if you breed the right dragons,you get so.ething you didnt even expect!!!!!!Like one time,i got a magic dragon.And i recently hatched a rainbow dragon,which  would have cost me 500 gold.Some of the habitats are a little costy,the one for the rainbkw dragon cost 500,000 coins.But i still love this game!!!!I hope this helped!!!!When you do get this game,add me!!!My ID is ChristLuver!!!!The name of my Island is Dream Island!!!!!Thank you!!!!!!

B003ICWTTM|5.0|This is a must buy for any Bruce Springsteen fan. This is the last tour with Clarence Clemons. A great souvenir and quality show with great video and sound. Love you Bruce.
B003G4W49C|5.0|A bit strange that kids this young were written into this story... Can't picture my grand daughter doing the things Ender and friends did at 8 years of age.. hard to believe.. writer should have made age a bit more believable.. But that being said once you accept that part of story its a good exciting book with a great ending... A definite read for those futuristic lovers
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great story line.  Well written.  Main characters were both not very likable which added to the complexity of the plot.<br />Did not care for the ending.
B00D0Z2JR4|1.0|The price from Japan is ¥ 2,928 converted to dollar is $29.95<br />you has to pay $100 more for shipping I do not know I'm wait I will expect this in version in English in region 1 US And Canada

B00B89WXYS|5.0|love it. first 4 songs are beyond catchy. reminds me of a cross b/w maroon 5 & coldplay. first song is my current fav for working out.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I've said it before, Colleen Hoover could write a phone book and it would probably be amazing, and I would love it. Hopeless is another five star read from Ms. Hoover. If there were more stars to give I would. There are so many things I would love to tell you about this book, but I would just ruin it for you, and I would never forgive myself for that. I will tell you that I do not often cry over fictional things, I cried. I don't often get all girly and say 'Awe' out loud, I said 'Awe' out loud several times. I don't read a lot of books with characters in high school, I quickly forgot that they are 17/18 year olds. Once I started reading I couldn't stop. Now, it isn't all that unusual for me to finish a book in a day or two. I usually take breaks, with Hopeless I could not stop! I just had to know what was going to happen, talk about book hangover. I would love to tell you that I only had these emotions that first time I read Hopeless, but after reading it for a third time all of the same emotions still apply. I still couldn't put it down either, even though I knew exactly what was going to happen and when. Hopeless, is just one of those books that no matter how many times you read it, it is just as good if not better than the first time. For that reason alone I love this book. If I took anything away from Hopeless, it is no matter what happens to you, or who you think you might be, sometimes fate knows who and what is best for you. Now, if you don't mind I think I might just have to go read Hopeless again....or maybe Losing Hope....<br /><br />[...]
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wow was this a bloody and gory book... Lots of excitement wrapped around a love story.. What else could a reader want.. Can't wait for the second movie this fall and the other movie after ... read this book for a good ride
B004APVI1G|5.0|I had this movie in blu-ray and it was good, but seeing it in 3d was really wonderful. Great buy!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is an awesome book. It's about a 16 year old girl with terminal cancer who falls in love. It's funny, sad, and entertaining. I would definitely recommend this book.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|At times quite schmaltzy with the heroes & heroines breathtakingly beautiful and the bad guys outrageously not.  Coincidences came a little too easily.  Nevertheless a wonderful novel.  Can't wait to read the third
B0049VZ222|5.0|Definately not for kids! The Characetrs are great, there are great back stories for all of them. Keeps your attention. Not too gory but gory enough. Just a great show.
B0006GQMC8|5.0|This is an excellent action film, one of the best ever made and one of my all times favourites! Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS:<br /><br />1. The inspiration.<br /><br />This film was inspired by real events. In July 1931, a man calling himself \\"Albert Johnson\\" settled on board of Rat River in Northwest Territories in Northern Canada. The man was a kind of irascible hermit, living from what he hunted or gathered in the woods and avoiding all human contact. Soon some local Indians complained that he regularly destroyed their traps and/or stole animals caught in them. On 31 December 1931 four Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) troopers came to his cabin with a search warrant - but \\"Johnson\\" refused to talk to them and instead opened fire, wounding one the policemen. Reinforcements were called and a long shootout began, after which \\"Johnson's\\" cabin was destroyed with dynamite - but he himself survived. Short on amunitions and concerned by the approaching blizzard, the policemen had to retreat. They were able to return only two weeks later - but \\"Johnson\\" was nowhere to be found.<br /><br />RCMP trackers managed finally to find his new hideout in the woods on 30 January 1932 but in a new shooting battle the fugitif bested the policemen, killed one of them and forced them to retreat again. From that moment this manhunt became front page news in Canadian press and the man was nicknamed \\"Mad Trapper of Rat River\\". The RCMP hired volunteers from local Indian tribes and also deployed at least one airplane (a first in police operations in Canada). The RCMP also blocked mountain passes to prevent the fugitif from escaping into neighboring province of Yukon. To general surprise \\"Johnson\\" managed nevertheless to cross the mountains anyway, passing at high altitude in the middle of snow storms!<br /><br />At that moment more planes were mobilised to try to follow the tracks of the \\"Mad Trapper\\" and finally it was one of the pilots who led the RCMP to the ultimate hiding place of the fugitif. On 17 February 1932, on board of Eagle River in Yukon territory, a new shootout took place in which one of the policemen was grievously wounded - but \\"Johnson\\" himself was killed. During all the time of manhunt and during all the three gunfights \\"Johnson\\" was never heard saying one single word...<br /><br />The name Albert Johnson was quickly discovered to be an alias - but the police was never able to discover who really was that man.<br /><br />2. The \\"Death Hunt\\" compared to the real story.<br /><br />This film changed very, very considerably the story, by showing \\"Johnson\\" (Charles Bronson) as indeed an almost totally silent hermit who limits his contact with other people to the strict minimum, but who is otherwise harmless, until the day he enters in conflict with some local bullies. In fact in the film \\"Johnson\\" initially is more a victim of agression than a crazed murderer. Also, the character of the pilot who tracked \\"Johnson\\" is in this film completely changed - and finally, we learn the \\"true identity\\" of the fugitif in the end. There are also some other changes and extra developments, which you will have to discover by yourself.<br /><br />3. The cast.<br /><br />Charles Bronson as \\"Johnson\\" and Lee Marvin as the grizzled, hard drinking \\"Mountie\\" who leads the manhunt would be already reason enough to see this film, as it was their first colaboration since \\"Dirty dozen\\" fourteen years earlier - and also the last one... Angie Dickinson appears also here in a small role and she is as always gorgous and awesome - and finally Carl Weathers plays here a black \\"Mountie\\" named George Washington Lincoln Brown (but everybody calls him \\"Sundog\\" for short). This ensemble cast makes this film a real must.<br /><br />4. The visual aspect and action scenes.<br /><br />Those are two greatly succesful aspects of this film. The deadly beauty of Canadian North in winter is shown here in all its lethal majesty - and the action scenes, although short, are excellently filmed.<br /><br />5. Relation to the first \\"Rambo\\"<br /><br />The character of Rambo was created in 1972, as main hero of his debut novel \\"First blood\\", by writer David Morrell. The plans to adapt this book for cinema began almost immediately but for a whole bunch of reasons nothing really happened for nine years. Then, the director of \\"Death Hunt\\" used some of the ideas of \\"First blood\\" in his own film (you will have to find by yourself which ones) and it finally pushed the producers to finalise their own project, not willing to see other similar films spoiling the market. For that reason the first \\"Rambo\\" finally was made and released in 1982 - and the director took a little revenge on his competitors by literally copying a couple of scenes from \\"Death Hunt\\" into the first \\"Rambo\\"...<br /><br />CONCLUSION: for all amateurs of action films, for all fans of Lee Marvin and Charles Bronson and for all guys (this is really NOT a chick flick) who like good cinema - this is a must! Go get it and enjoy watching it and re-watching it!es, although short, are excellently filmed.<br /><br />5.

B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Great game that makes you think about every day phrases. Some are a little easy but others really had me scratching my head
1559210400|4.0|Did Pearl Buck write a novel that wasn't a bit of a downer at the end?  I really enjoyed the crisp clear writing but the ending is a bit of a bummer.
1455526959|4.0|Not as good as his older ones. Is the Great One slipping? Like a lot of popular hot-shot writers of detective material, these guys start to believe their reviews, many of which are written by hacks.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|4stars.  I didn't get involved with this book initially thinking it was directed at a younger crowd.  Curiosity let me to.try it and now I'm hooked on the story of Katniss.  I enjoy characters who are multidimensional and stories that sho people's strengths and vulnerability.
B00DHHFKE4|2.0|Didn't find it as good as it leads you to believe. It wasn't enthralling, it barely gave you an insight to womens prisons.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|graphics are wonderful. gotta love the minions. difficult to navigate at first but it gets better. free is always good.
B008TRH5N6|1.0|I've read many books on this subject and amongst all the stuff like this out there this was a big waste of time.

0307010856|5.0|I don't remember reading this book for myself, although it certainly has been around long enough.  I do, however, remember reading this book to one of my younger siblings, probably my younger sister.  Anyway, today I read it to my almost-five-year-old son for the first time.<br /><br />My son wasn't at all anxious about the monster at the end of the book.  He kept pointing to Grover and saying \\"That's a monster!\\"  So the ending did not surprise him at all, although it did make him laugh.  I don't remember how my sibling reacted when I read it to her (or him), but I'm pretty sure it was pretty close to my son's reaction.  Despite the \\"monster\\" in the title, there is nothing frightening about this book.  And that is a very good thing.  It's also a very good thing if we learn to laugh at our \\"monsters\\".
B009PK9SB8|5.0|My son has the Go Pro camera but always has to remove it from its mount and connect it to an external monitor to view his captured footage. He was delighted and surprised to receive this touch screen display and wasn't aware such a thing was available!
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Clearly this book remains one of the best books. Anyone who is a fan of the pirate genre will see where all of our expectations for a pirate story came from. The language may be a bit of a challenge to younger readers, but in spite of this,I highly recommend this book for readers 10 and up.
072325804X|5.0|This is a lovely packaged/presented collection of timeless children stories that I purchased for my niece. I'm sort of the poor, loser uncle so I hope she remembers I bought her something nice.

B0055PGUYU|5.0|Reading this book was enlightening and helpful for my own personal growth.  I learned to remember to take some medicine by incorporating it into my daily routine after reading about how to form new habits.  Like the author pointed out at the end, there isn't one formula to change your habits, but if you exercise your free will, anything is possible.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Can't wait for the next book!! Awesome story! Never know who is going to survive or not! Couldn't stop reading!
B004U7JYXS|5.0|Love the camera - take it to parties - everyone loves to take the little instant photos home with them.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Great mobile app with enough to do to keep you playing.  Waiting for a pc version of the game. If you played the PlayStation version in the 90s you will like this game.
0547258305|1.0|This book hooked me almost from the first page, intriguing unfolding of an interesting story line, three dimensional characters who developed and grew with the plot elements, smooth engaging prose.<br /><br />There's just so much fabulous in this book, but I can't recommend it because of it's clear agenda: 1. Marriage is a prison. (I wondered what life experiences drove the author to that erroneous conclusion) 2. Fully giving your body to another without commitment exacts no price, and is actually superior to marriage. NOTE: This agenda isn't clear until well after you're engaged in the plot and care about the characters.<br /><br />Why won't today's society even touch on the reality that engaging in sex without formal commitment causes us to give up something not easily reclaimed (and no, I'm not referring to virginity)? Why don't we explore that it's only within marriage that sex becomes the soul-satisfying, unifying experience that emotionally welds two people together in a way nothing else can?<br /><br />That this book was exceptional in so many ways while promoting this erroneous agenda is so disappointing, and so typical of our society's warped view of sex.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Magic the gathering...made easy.  Now I have this game on my tablet I don't have to interact with the other nerds.  If that's not enough for you it also has all the rules so you don't  have to argue with the previously mentioned nerds about the finer points of card interpretation.  Anyone that has played the game before knows someone like I'm talking about.  So to wrap it all up good nerdy fun without the smelly nerds.  If you like magic the gathering get this game.
B006LSZECO|5.0|So far the book is very rich with descriptive language.  I have not finished it yet, but i'm enjoying every page so far.
B00015YVD6|5.0|This film is true movie magic.  I first saw this at a theatre that no longer exists and the memories of watching this film back then really stirs me.  I saw this film when I was 12 years old and I thought this film was so magnificent, splendurous, beautiful and moving, I never got it out of my head.  I specially loved the soundtrack.  For years I looked for the soundtrack of this film and thank the stars and the moon several years ago I went into this music/movie store and found the actual motion picture soundtrack record for two or four bucks.  Well, needless to say I snatched it up quick and  spinned it on my record player until I had to purchase another player. I will never forget this movie, or Tom Hank or Daryl Hannah because they really marked a time in my life I will never forget... and for that, I thank them.  A really beautiful film that is timeless and deserved to be revisited by all generations.
B0015DWJX2|3.0|I loved knowing the characters through Juliet's eyes. At first, couldn't get used to the format, but started looking forward to the letters. Found the overall story and historyba little lacking and distant, but liked the unbelievable ending anyway. Cute story.

B0036UMM84|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time when I was a teenager. I fell in love with it then - I had the sound track and knew all the songs by heart ! When I saw I could rent and watch it again on Amazon I did it !! There were a lot of things I didn't remember - It is a great story of Love, inspiration - a man that finds the love of his life and gives all of HIS Success to her. Of course Barbra ia an amazing singer - so that was a major hit for the film !!
B00E1L9N8E|1.0|Sorry to say, I watched this movie in intervals. I simply could not place myself into the story. Not a one of the characters was interesting or identifiable or relatable to oneself (at least not to me). Most of the time in movies there is at least one sympathetic character to whom the audience can relate or with whom or for whom one could find sympathy or empathy -- not the case in this remake. I found myself feeling somewhat embarrassed for the actors. They surely will not be remembered favorably for these roles.<br /><br />I recall the original (the earlier) movie with Redford and Farrow, and my memory of their acting is/was much better and their characters much keener and on point. I truly feel that this remake was a total waste of time and money. Every second of it seemed phony. \\"Boring\\" is a word I do not often use with movies, but this one certainly was. There was a lot of senseless noise and action; nothing advanced the story enough for me to watch more than five minutes at a time.<br /><br />Generally, I like Leonardo, but even he fell completely flat in this movie.<br /><br />As a friend of mine used to way, when describing something so unentertaining: \\"I'd rather sit on the porch and watch grass grow.\\" That's my feeling, too.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I had the &#34;low internal storage&#34; message for over a month. I did not know what else I could put in the &#34;cloud&#34; so just kept ignoring it.

B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|A lot of fun to play. This game involves a lot of planning and looking ahead. Contrary to the way some games work, working off fewer buttons per move is often the key to winning. Going through the levels takes you very gently to more and more difficult puzzles. Addictive play that takes enough thought to keep you interested without being so difficult that it is more stressful than relaxing.
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|Downloaded as a free book, didn't expect much but turned out to be a easy read and well as a page turner, loved the french aspects of the story;  food, tourist spots.  Have an afternoon to read a fun book pick this one up you won't regret it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I could not put this book down! It did get a little slow in some spots, but the story line definitely had me hooked to keep going! This book has become one of my favorites.<br />The ending was a little \\"fast\\" for me. I feel that there is sooo much more that can be told,but I understand there has to be an ending somewhere.
B000FBJHZS|4.0|It is a very good book with much detail.  It keeps me turning the pages.  It has a very good ending.
B00BSBT8M6|2.0|If like to watch animals killing each other you will like this...we do not. Very well done movie?..yes but just not fun to watch for us anyway
B000EHRVP6|3.0|a error on my part.  I have this movie in my collection already.  I passed it on to someone else.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A book I couldn't put down. I shared the lives with these characters and ached to belong in their circle.  The courage of these \\"side effects\\" was captured perfectly.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Always great to have Pinterest at your finger tips, constanly finding new ideas for cooking, crafts and just plain fun!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This is NOT my first streaming media appliance, so I've had a bit of experience with the different technologies.  This one's a lot different from my WDTv, TiVo, and Sony Smart DVD.  Of the four, the Chromecast has the BEST netflix quality and overall user experience of all of them, and for that alone, it's worth the getting.<br /><br />SETUP<br /><br />Out of the box, the HDMI dongle plugs into your TV, or, AV AMP.  I elected to go to the back of the amp, and I used a 3 foot HDMI extension to bring the dongle out of the furniture where the wireless signal would be clean.  It comes with a small extender of its own (about 3 inches).  Because my amp didn't have a USB port, I just used one on the Samsung TV instead.  It worked perfectly.  This is nice because you don't have to go finding another 120v outlet for it.<br /><br />Instructions on the screen were simple, and I had the thing streaming Netflix, YouTube, and my music from Google Play within a few minutes time.<br /><br />PROBLEMS<br /><br />Unfortunately, I came up against some things I expected to be able to do, but can't.<br /><br />1) Interface to Google Chrome Browser doesn't work for iPad.  After 20 minutes of screwing about, I finally found a google page that said \\"not YET available, but SOON\\".<br /><br />2) I had a similar problem with my Android phone.  Went to download the chrome browser, and got \\"Not a Compatible Device\\"  My smart phone is only 2 years old, so I found it irritating that an ANDROID phone couldn't load a working browser.<br /><br />These two items make it impossible for me to take advantage of one of the key features of the Chromecast.<br /><br />3) Not sure why, but the graphics shown when streaming music from Google Play are REALLY horrible - it looks worse than an 8 bit blurred rendition of the album cover.<br /><br />FINAL NOTES<br /><br />I'm going to hold on to this - I have hopes that compatibility with other apps will improve.  Hopefully, I'll be able to watch my AMAZON PRIME movies on it too - that would be nice...
B0002JP4L4|4.0|It will always be a favorite movie.  Every time I watch it I want to get up and dance.  The music is great.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Easier to use, for a tablet, than the web site.<br />lists watched, buying, selling. one stop shop.<br />very good program.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|It's marvelous what ideas can become after watching this movie. The storyline is fabulous the cast did a great job as well,  very convincing and making you feel been involved in it as well. Plenty of on the go action with a few twist and turns to upset the story a bit as to make you think. I rated this an A grade plus for sheer entertainment that keeps you on your toes as to not knowing what is next. The story is out of this world and very different, to explain it's a bit hard as not to give away all its plots so now its up to you to go get it and have a look. Now it's time for a bit of relaxation so put your feet up grab some popcorn and watch a wonderful movie from another world.  Enjoy!
1572522828|4.0|This is well done soft porn. Some story, some good looking folks and steamy events that is designed to be arousing.
B008UX2UIO|5.0|A very funny read about a pompous, terribly undefeated anti-hero who bumbles his way through 1960s New Orleans and hilarity ensues.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This story, within most of it's negative reviews, still shows the hallmark of a true classically styled tales - it seems shorter than it is.<br /><br />This is due to the ease of reading this story...it's as if you were having a particularly lucid dream. No more effort than that is required to enjoy.<br /><br />The characters, while not fleshed out, still have depth.<br /><br />This is the literary equivalent of those nipponse paintings in which two or three brushstrokes somehow accurately depict a mountain in more depth than a western oil painting.
B000G73U5Y|4.0|If you like Steely Dan, you will love this CD.  It has all of the big songs of Steely Dan.
B000FC146C|5.0|Great book had seen the mini series years ago but never read the book<br />It is soooo much better the only thing was the main male character in the book was dark & in the series he was fair hard to change my perception.<br />A hard to put down book with perfect description of the Australian outback
B005LAII44|5.0|Very interesting as to remark on this show, I found it intriguing and plenty of action from beginning to end which I really love it, and the cast did it with full on emotion. The storyline has a few hidden plots and twists in it as well. Entertaining that you will be glued to the chair not wanting to miss anything. So the action is with the good guys and the bad guys we know who is going to win don't we, A very intelligent and well planned storyline, I have given the movie a rating of  A grade plus for edge of the seat entertainment keeping me amused. So have you collected your popcorn and ready to put your feet up yet ( I am in a minute) so go and relax to a fabulous night of great entertainment and enjoy.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this this book. I was different from the Harry Potter series but just as well written as as they were.
1439181780|5.0|This is a fast read...you will not want to put this book down.  Share it with everyone.  Lots of common sense and a little jolt into the reality that we get back what we send out.  Sending love, even to those we don't understand or have a bad history with, will help us enjoy life more.  Tips for finances and good health were interesting.  I just loaned out my copy.
B00006F7IM|4.0|One of my favorite comedy's.  Still trying to find a JoBu doll for my office.  A classic movie for sure.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Well its a good thing I wasn't reading this from a paperback copy because I would have ruined it with my tears. This was awesome. Long story short, read the book. You won't regret it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game because it's a never ending game and you start off with a island and you get money and make a house  and bla bla bla it's fun and great! GET IT!!!
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|For a sequel it was great! Really looking forward to #3. Wish the enemy would have been revealed in a different sequel.
B007HACDLK|5.0|We'll miss you Vince Flynn. Rest in Peace. You were a great writer. Read all of his books and will more coming.
B008JFUTUY|5.0|Excellent documentary that is inspiring. Hope springs eternal! An incredible surprise which is uplifting with some underlying conundrum as to the music entertainment industry
0345803485|5.0|It was in great condition with no damage to the cover or pages and it arrived really fast! I was extremely happy with my book!
B003ASLJK4|5.0|This was a gift... but the person loves the movie and was very grateful that I sent it for his birthday
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Man surprise how good it is, and how it change the story line from old Star Trek, was Extreme good to see
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Thanks to the author for providing a great end to a great story.I truly enjoyed reading this series. Will there be more??
B0032JTV6U|2.0|the 7th disc skips on the last episode was kind of disappointing, but other than that all other discs work fine just very upset that i might have to buy the whole thing all over again because of one disc.
B002ZCY7TG|5.0|good job
B002E01LL6|2.0|This was the worst movie I've seen with Channing Tatum. I was very disappointed. But, for the record he has made a lot of good ones.
B004SDEP38|3.0|Its a great tool for office users, lets you creat/edit/view your documents, saved me a bunch of times. It could have a better UI tho and the price tag is offensive.
B0091QS88K|4.0|unlike all the other dr. panda games this game actually lets you do stuff in a process of elimination... really good
B007DIQC90|1.0|I just finished listening to this album.  I'll never get that time back.  Not enjoyable.  Borrowed the CD to give it a listen based on hearing \\"Mountain Sound\\" and \\"Little Talks\\" on the radio.<br /><br />This album is too bland and down right boring, I guess I'm just not into this genre.  The 2 aforementioned songs came from the same cookie cutter mold sound wise. \\"Six Weeks\\" was ok, even that didn't impress me enough to even want to rip an MP3 copy for the car.<br /><br />This album was downhill from there.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|The game where everything began. Not the best (I like Bad Piggies more), but still gives hours of fun :)
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This a game perfect for people who love animals. I think it is a great game! I have a  lot of fun playing, catching various animals and dinosaurs. I recommend it for kids of all ages. Have fun playing!
B001UV4XFG|5.0|This dvd was in perfect shape. There were no scratches and the case was in perfect shape also. I wouldn t have guessed it was purchased used. I would buy from this seller again.
B004SKHJF2|3.0|Shazam is pretty cool, but the encore is way expensive to be recomendable. But if you want unlimited tags go for it!
B0063M22QO|4.0|This is an excellent app.  I got exactly what I was looking for in this game.  Plus there is no ads to disrupt your game.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Finally got to see this show and it's great.  I bought this as a gift but got to watch it myself.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This was the second big hit - for me at least - on the android platform that survived the first 30 minutes :)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is challenging, yet entertaining. I got the game for free, but it is well worth the price. If you like puzzle games this is the game for you!
1451695195|3.0|My book club book read this for the month of July. It's a good read but it's so hard not to be skeptical. I very much believe Dr. Alexander experienced this exactly as he documents and wish it were really true but am just not sure...Regardless, his message is something we can all live by for if we have no hope, what exactly is our purpose on this planet?
B00846WWVM|1.0|This game is a ripoff, just got it cuz it was free, lame controls make it hard to be enjoyable.
0345529057|4.0|Really fast transport, very cheap so its perfekt. The book story follow the tv version pretty good, so read it first before seeing it..
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|The story was well written and continually kept my interest. The detail from research and data gathering was extensive and helped develop a story including important history and personal accomplishments. I recommend this book to any one interested in WW II history and some of the German's personal perspectives during the war.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Always a winner. U can not lose with this game at any time. Angry birds just goes on and on.
0345529057|5.0|Some earlier reviews stated that the product was cheaply made or their books fell apart. Neither was true for my order. All books have been well read without losing any pages or having any issues with the spine.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|great keyboard. So much better than my default Android keyboard oh my gawd. I'm keeping it for life and naming it spikey.
B00CTXBO9M|5.0|Its so addictive and enjoyable that everyone that hasnt played it falls in love in the first time they do.
B00BS3EMNY|5.0|Loved it! To me it's a unique style of music and can't wait to hear more music from Ms Emerald!
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|this game is awsome. Its great but it needs more time. I really don't build anything I just play around with the animals and stuff.  but still is a good app
B00DGABUIC|4.0|I bought this since it was such a cute little collectible from the HTTYD series. I payed $15 for it only to find it for $5 in Target. Save your money, go there or probably Toys R Us. I go to Amazon to find better deals.
B00BQEETPG|5.0|Gallagher was a true blues innovator.  He took the basics a step above and beyond.  Its been a joy to rediscover this technical and soulful masterpiece.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I thought It was going to be a hard game, but not , and easy to play. I really enjoy it.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|Helpful tasks n todos tool, would recomend it for everyone who is looking for a nice alternative. The UI needs a little improvement tho,.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Good overall difficult to follow at times due to the format and timeing.  I look forward to future endeavors by Max
B005IQZB14|3.0|It was nice to read about the PCT and reminisce on my time on the AT.  Everybody's trail journey has a different meaning or significance that's hard to put into words. Commendable effort.
B00CISC2DA|5.0|After waiting years for a new BoC album I was somewhat nervous about being disappointed.<br />I was not disappointed in the slightest bit. It was better than I could have imagined and I'm still listening to it all the time.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The USB Cable works great, and because its longer, it reaches further I can also use it for so many other electronics that I have.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Fantastic storyline that keeps you reading to see what is really going on in this strange world. I am not much of a reader as my busy schedule and family keep me occupied. I wanted to do something different while on vacation and decided to read a book. Searching on Amazon to find a well liked Sci-Fi novel, I found the reviews for Wool were off the charts. I found myself quickly reading the first book, which is free, and had to buy the rest. I just finished the last Wool book and will be starting Shift soon, reading it when I can squeeze in the time.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game is pretty amazing, its worth every dolar for it, problably one of the most amazing games i've played

1452000247|5.0|Peter, a ten year-old boy, finds a little box he likes in an antique shop. Inside the box, there is a secret compartment that holds \\"a silver ball, a pineapple chunk, and the most wonderful key he had ever seen.\\" And the key opens the door to an adventure the likes of which Peter could only dream of.<br /><br />There is a reason this book has \\"A Darkened Fairy Tale\\" in its title. It starts as a regular kids' novel. Peter meets a friendly, if \\"odd-looking bird,\\" Seebright, Fingle the bug, who likes to eat pineapple chunks, and a little mouse. Peter has to deliver some golden flakes to the fairy grotto, and so on. So far so good, right? Well it gets really strange really fast from then on. Approximately from this point, for me, at least (I am paraphrasing the dialog):<br /><br />\\"Toad, why are we steam?\\" Peter asked.<br />\\"Well, my boy,\\" the toad said, \\"if you will observe, there is a crack in the brickwork. We had to vaporize to enter.\\"<br /><br />Narrowly escaping being eaten by Cirinian guards and warned of great evil by a mysterious man only he can see is the least of the troubles Peter gets himself into. The deeper Peter goes, the darker the story gets. It's not \\"scary\\" in a traditional sense, but the narrative deeps into some very unexpected directions, sweeping Peter along the way.<br /><br />\\"Peter: A Darkened Fairytale\\" by William O'Brien is a cross-generational book, in my humble opinion. Kids will see a likable, relatable protagonist who goes through different adventures and meets colorful, interesting characters along the way. For adult readers, this is a trippy journey where preconceived stereotypes are put upside-down and sideways. The adults will probably perceive the constant stream of imaginative characters that are appearing in a rapid succession differently as well. These multiple levels of understanding  is a quality this book shares with classics like \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and \\"Wizard of Oz.\\" There's reality and there's a world beyond it, just make a plunge. As Seebright says:<br /><br />\\"Many years ago, plunging was discovered when the moon was in two halves--it's all about dreams, you see!\\"<br /><br />So, take a plunge and give it a read. This is a well-written, extremely imaginative novel.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received a copy of this book for purposes of a review.e a plunge.

B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book was an awesome read. Shows you love can come in any form. If you love a good cry, read this!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This can only stream a few things:  Google Play contents, Google Music, YouTube, Netflix, and a tab in Chrome browser on PC/Mac.  That's it.  If this is what you are looking for, this product is perfect.  If not, then this product is not for you.<br /><br />My major use is playing songs on Google Music on my home theatre receiver.  I like the fact that i can turn on some music anywhere at home using just my phone.  This is very similar to Airplay on iPhone, except that that it does so without draining my phone's battery, since it's streaming directly from Google Music cloud service, and my phone only acts as a controller.
B00C5XBAOA|3.0|The heads pop off very easily, but re-attach just as easy.  King Roland will not stand on his own which is frustrating to my daughter. The castle also does not play the right sounds for each character.
1475143389|1.0|Dont get me wrong, I'm not a professional by any means, and I cant say I didnt learn anything from this book but it was just painful to read. So many opinions forced down your throat as facts and unproven as well. I'm 6'1, 205Pds and growing, but I can't say its due to reading this book. Just look tips up online and save your money.
B008GANNIC|5.0|Another Excellent CD. This is just one more of the bands incredible albums. Payable on Death is one of my favorite bands.
B002APU580|5.0|Excellent cinematography and music!  This is a very long story that has been compressed into a 2 hour movie, and those familiar with this story will feel the compression.  However, if you take this movie on it's own - it's an excellent rendition of a classic book.  Both leading actors are very good although Keira Knightley can sometimes appear too modern for the rest of the background.<br /><br />If you can avoid being distracted by Keira's obvious short hair being made to appear long, then this movie is a great late-night treat.
B0000844I8|5.0|Really liked the movie.  Watch the Scifi series for years.  Wanted to own this in our collection so I ordered it.  Love it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is one of the few games that a young child can play and understand the main point of this game.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Hans Zimmer may not have managed to create a theme as iconic as the John Williams &#34;Superman&#34; theme, but he has created a soundtrack that lets you feel the intensity of the superpowered action, and the emotion of the questioning Clark Kent. My two favorite tracks are &#34;Flight&#34;, which captures the glory and wonder of discovery of power and excitement, and &#34;What are you going to do when you're not saving the world?&#34;, an absolutely glorious triumphant anthem. If you found yourself moved by the music in the movie, give this one a go.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Loved it. Saw it on Oprah and got to know about this book . Written very simply, but beautifully.Thank you
B00AQA0OJG|5.0|I love this figure. As a huge fan of SAO and of Asuna, I wanted this figure for a while. I was aware that there  are some bootlegs out there of it, but I am happy to report that I got this directly from Amazon and it was an authentic version. I love the dynamic pose and the stand. If you are a fan of the show, you will like this figure
B00008CMR6|5.0|John Wayne has always been a favorite of mine.  My family loves him, too and this was a gift for my son and his family. It has always been one of his favorite Wayne pictures.
B00DYEN5QU|5.0|Gone are the days on Superman wearing his underwear over his pants...and his name(now he is just Man of Steel)so, This is what the public deserves and what it needs-- An actual depiction of how Superman is not just what the studios from the 70's wanted. You must watch this we the expectation of starting from fresh, not thinking about previous iterations of the Man of Steel but coming into this with a popcorn in hand and not knowing who Superman is; this will bring an open mind along.
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|&#34;Tucker and Dale vs Evil&#34; is comedy horror gold. In this case, it takes the classic model of &#34;crazy hillbilly killers in the wild&#34; and completely turns it on its head, with side-splitting results. The titular Tucker and Dale are two good old boys looking to enjoy a weekend fishing and fixing up their new cabin they purchased (a fixer-upper, to put it lightly). They can be a bit dim-witted in some regards, and are simple people from simple backgrounds, but they are also good, honest, hardworking individuals who value the friendship they share and are extremely likable. Meanwhile, some college kids happen to also be camping nearby, who are rather full of themselves and disdainful (and fearful) of hillbilly types. When an accident at a lake at night results in our two heroes saving a young woman from the college kids' group, it sets off a series of events that first convinces the girls' &#34;friends&#34; that she has been kidnapped. Following a botched rescue attempt, the clueless kids become convinced our pair are just a bunch of deranged killers, even though it's entirely the dumb kids accidentally killing themselves! Things just escalate and get out of hand from there. It's great fun watching all the ways the kids manage to kill themselves, and manage to convince themselves it's the fault of the rednecks. It reverses what you'd expect about who is the hero and who is the villain, as well as who is smart and who is dumb.
B00992CF6W|5.0|one of the best games I have ever played in my lifetime.best game ever made in the world is MINECRAFT!!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I am enjoying the game but you have to pretty much figure out things as you go. the instructions tell you to find objects but not that you have to randomly tap until you find a puzzle or object. Its worth it for a free app but be prepared to struggle a little at first with what you actually have to do.
B008VBYN80|5.0|Great game  it's fun and amusing and gets all that I want out of it.  It's a great game to play with all of your best and greatest friends drone all over the world and back.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I have this and 1 other app for files on my kindle fire. They both work great. Explore your kindle fire just like you would your computer with windows explorer.
B006O5YHUY|5.0|Warrior is an incredible movie with equally accomplished and incredible acting.  This is the type of movie that will jack you up and make you cry in the same two hours.  Although it puts MMA on full display, this movie is not about fighting.  This movie is about family - family once lost, now finding its way back to good.
B00002N9ER|5.0|Mounting brackets are very strong.  They come with screws but I purchased self tapping screws since I was drilling into metal.  Because of the angle and small area I was attaching them the brackets took a beating from my drill.  If these were cheap plastic they would have snapped but they held strong.<br /><br />I have the light attached under the seat of my honda.  These clips hold a tight seal and I never hear the light rattle and it never slides, always in the same position I leave it in.
B00A27X972|2.0|The novel communicated relatively superficial platitudes about being a human, and was disappointed that it didn't challenge the reader in a more meaningful way. I felt that the storyline was overly simplistic, with little development of plot or character details that make a novel an exceptional reading experience.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Not the best but not the worst out there either it's a decent time killer all I can think to add is being able to rotate buildings
0688158234|5.0|Beautiful read! An amazing story of courage and huge will power. As for the product itself, I don't have any complains either. It came exactly as advertised and on time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love horses and this is just like owning one, in pretend world, of course. Must have game for little girls. My girls love it, play it all the time,, especially when I

B00EV4EUT8|4.0|The full name is \\"Lee Daniels' The Butler\\" but that is only because of a legal dispute over the title. Director Daniels (\\"Precious\\") has once again evoked powerful performances from the entire cast, some of whom have worked with him before.<br /><br />Inspired by an article written by Wil Haygood about a real White House butler named Eugene Allen, this film creates a fictitious gentleman who, over three decades in the White House, serves as a butler to eight presidents. Had this been better explained, it would have avoided the controversy that followed the movie's release.<br /><br />This story encompasses a turbulent period in the history of the American Civil Rights Movement, but Danny Strong's Forrest Gumpish screenplay made me feel a bit manipulated as we went to Selma, Birmingham, Oakland, etc., etc., where we witnessed hide-your-eyes events that triggered (but ultimately advanced) the movement.<br /><br />We see:<br />  * Forest Whitaker (\\"The Last Stand\\") is mesmerizing as Cecil Gaines who first becomes a butler for Dwight D. Eisenhower and continues his service into the Reagan Administration. Whitaker ages convincingly and is in top form for this year's Oscars.<br />  * Oprah Winfrey (\\"Ocean's Thirteen\\") is his wife Gloria, who seems to be in chronic rivalry with her husband's prestigious job.<br />  * David Oyelowo (\\"Jack Reacher\\") is their son Louis, who becomes increasingly radical, much to his parents' dismay.<br />  * Lenny Kravitz (\\"Precious\\") is one of five other White House butlers who provide social commentary and humor.<br />  * Liev Schreiber (\\"Defiance\\") steals the presidential show as Lyndon B. Johnson because LBJ's profane bombast is so theatrical.<br />  * Mariah Carey (\\"Precious\\") is our hero's mother, raped, abused and ultimately mad.<br />  * Alan Rickman (\\"Galaxy Quest\\" ...smile...) is Ronald Reagan, the fellow who listened to our hero and finally raised the salaries of the black staff to match those of the whites. Ronald and Nancy inviteour hero and his wife to be guests at a White House dinner.<br /><br />There are far, far too many other fine actors to name, space doesn't permit me to identify all the players in this 132 minute outing. Be prepared to laugh at the generation gap as Gaines and his wife encounter changing attitudes, clothes and politics through their son. \\"Black Power? What does that mean?\\" and \\"Shaneequa? What kind of a name is that?\\"<br /><br />This is rated PG-13, so expect horrifying examples of racism, but no sweaty bodies, very little gunfire, and no blowie uppie stuff, but the \\"N\\" word is used repeatedly and the police dogs are scary. When I watch this again on DVD, I will relish the closed captions, although most of the audience clearly did NOT need them.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Wow...what a fun game.  I've had this game sitting in my carousel  all alone for a long time.  For some reason, I decided to try it; and boy was I surprised.  The graphics are exciting and the play was contagious.  I know I'll be playing this game many, many times a day and night.  I hope anyone that may read this will check it out cause I know you'll enjoy it.
B00B22ASUM|4.0|I am a veterinarian and animal lover and when I saw an article about this book in People magazine I bought it.  It's a great story, written in a straightforward manor but also filled with emotion, hope and inspiration. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a feel good story about a love between a man and his best friend, Bob, a very special cat.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|So far it's good. I'm new in this community and I can't really give a review cause I don't know what's going on.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|this is on of my favorite horror movies, in fact this is the only movie I truly love that was not a book before hand. Unless you do not like horror movies, I don't understand why someone wouldn't love this movie.

B000KKPN5C|4.0|This is a nice travel flash given its small size.  It also functions nicely as a fill flash outdoors with a decent range.  Despite its small size you can still angle it away and bounce the flash off walls for a smoother contrast.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I thought I was downloading the game only to find out that after this downloaded, the game isn't available.  Go figure - what a waste

B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I really appreciate the historical perspective that Aslan puts the story of Jesus in.  Regardless of your faith this book is worth reading to further appreciate Jesus and who he was to the Jews at that time.
B00B9366VO|5.0|If you are into foo fighters, nirvana, Johnny cash, Rick Springfield and others, you'll enjoy this movie  highly recommend it
B005S9ELVC|5.0|This is the best gangster movie I have seen in awhile. I liked the story and the actors were great especially sean penn he is an actors actor that guy is an excellent actor and the rest did pretty good as well. I like josh brolin but I think his character was a little bit wimpy, but he did good. I thought that this movie was awesome. the action is pretty good and emma stone was very beautiful in this movie. the costume designer went all out in this movie. he/she did a great job. this is a good film. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Just what I need to know what the weather will be each day. Even when I travel this app is very handy. Great for everyday use.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|minions are extremely cool. I wish I was a minion. despicable me minion rush is the best game I ever played.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Very well researched and reasoned.  It provides a realistic and highly readable portrait of the historical Jesus with some logical conjecture which is very much at odds with the popular beliefs.  I do wish Asian had provided more space to Paul and how his personal teachings came to overshadow the reality of Jesus's teachings.  It should be read by every Christian to give them perspective on what they hear in church.
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|On the game you need more music cars and guns but I play it all the time so thanks so much
1609611543|5.0|This physician has really uncovered something.  Well-written book communicating in detail, what happened to the wheat product we all consume -- to our detriment.  We have changed our eating as a result of this book and we've gotten healthier, felt better and lost some weight.  It's not that hard to do.  We don't miss what we've changed out.

B00C2VIA52|5.0|Of all the games I play, this one's my favorite.  It's a little hard to get good cards without spending real money for them, but other than that it's a really great game.  Highly recommend it.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|With certain inputs you type something in it takes over your screen and makes it white with your tekst until you're finished typing. This is somewhat counter intuitive. The default swiftkey settings doesn't have the numpad enabled either, which should be very doable on a tablet... I do like that the keys are a bit wider than my tablet default keyboard and the contextual predictions get better and better the more you use swiftkey.
B005544V6A|5.0|I love this series... the cut throat world of lawyers. Writer do an excellent job on story lines.  Watch it
B000JMKQX0|5.0|A masterpiece. It is not the cliche'd &#34;bug into a mall and kill them all&#34; story, it is a sort of documentary; something that no one else can do.
B009UMTMKS|5.0|In 2011, I left a hedge fund to start AppAddictive, a social advertising software platform company.<br />I joined an accelerator to speed up my start-up process.  I raised some angel money for my startup.<br />I was feeling good, but I was having difficulty keeping up with Facebook's rapid changes.  Enter<br />Steve Blank's books &#34;Four Steps to Epiphany&#34; and &#34;Startup Owner's Manual&#34;.<br />These two books saved my startup's life.  I was able to pivot our company. A few months later, I used<br />my hedge fund knowledge to take over a Nasdaq public company called LookSmart.  I have made these 2 books<br />required reading for the entire LookSmart team.  I like the culture of LookSmart to be data-driven, lean startup oriented.<br />No room for ego's. Celebrate failures. Fail fast.<br /><br />Steve Blank's books are making the revival of LookSmart possible.  Now, Steve would you like to give a speech for our next LookSmart 3 day team building session :) ?  Thanks!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|All the emotions are there. Addicting and fun. It left me wondering about secrets in real life. Definitely recommend it!
0385523394|5.0|I apologize for the blatant commercial directive in the title, but that is how I feel. This book (and the Netflix series loosely based on the book) are so socially important and clearly so entertaining, you shouldn’t miss them and you shouldn’t let your friends miss them. The social importance and the entertainment value applies to both men and women, from young (mid-teens) to…well, not young. Entertaining? You don’t need me to tell you: this is one of the hottest short-TV-series out there, and it’s been renewed for another season. Socially important? There are more people (per capita) in prison in the U.S. than in most other countries combined. We’ve seen recent efforts to stem the tide; let’s keep the momentum going. Read the book. Watch the series. Be entertained. Get fired up.
B000001E7T|5.0|She sings of dark things. Love and heartbreak. She's spooky and oh so real. More real and honest than Florence and the Machine. Darker than Souxie and the Banshees, and i love them both.
B009RX85N0|5.0|When I first started watching Once Upon a Time I was hooked. Even the previews prior to release were exciting. Once the first Season was over I was craving for more. Leaving a series at a high point makes you want for more. When Season 2 was released I was eager to see it. Sometimes the second season is not quite as exciting as the first season but after watching it i feel that it is just as good as the first season. The only downfall is the wait between Seasons - Great for the kids and young adult!!
B00DQBWLSO|2.0|Lyrically, John still has something to say, but musically, I feel this one is flat. He went to the folk/country-rock sound from 1970 with \\"B and R\\" and goes much deeper into that realm with \\"Paradise Valley.\\" \\"B and R\\" took a while to grow on me, but eventually I liked it. Some of the tracks could have different background arrangments, but all in all, I respect his musicianship and his song writing craft, but I miss the innovative sounds of the previous records. \\"PV\\" sounds very 40 years ago.
B00297FEUI|5.0|i have the transformers trlogy dvds and soundtrack.  this rounds out my collection, i would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys action
B0027MJU00|5.0|I've read both Gone Girl and Sharp Objects before Dark Places.  I have to say, I am a big fan of Gillian Flynn! She definitely pulls the reader into her stories.  Hoping she comes out with more great books.
B00BVYLBP2|4.0|This series starts off with a bang and keeps on going. Its got a brisk pace and very little feels extraneous. Another win for the BBC!
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|I was \\"blown away\\" by the details.  The screams were blood curdling.  With a minimal amount of dialogue, this movie informs in a very innovative way the brutal tsunami.
B004Q7CIFI|2.0|The last King book I read was the Tommyknockers, which just wasn't compelling enough to finish, and I never read anymore after that. So this is the first Stephen King book I've read since 1987. And I have the same problem now I had with his writing then--the characters don't feel real to me, the dialogue between characters doesn't ring true to me and, of course, the book is way too long. My problem with 11/22/63 is it's a 200 page story in an 800 page book, with very little payoff at the end. King's time travel rules are fascinating and it has some very good moments spread out through the long, epic course of the story. 11/22/63 isn't a bad book. It's a reasonably good book that requires the reader to hang in there. And hang in there. And hang in there. But for me, the payoff just wasn't there.
B00000K3D4|5.0|this dvd shows the excellent work john henson has done to create live action and fantasy.  it is a classic as far as i'm concerned
B005544TRQ|5.0|Excellent show.  If you want a believable show with a bit of humor this is exactly what can satsfy you
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Quick, easy and works just like the site! Keep up on bids on the go! 2 thumbs up!<br />Can't live without it now.
B003V4AK8E|3.0|This is Ok controller, buttons are good, design and ergonomics, the grip, wich a lot of people say is annoying, i didn't find it at all.<br /><br />The main issue is sticks and d pad, the sticks are stiff and have pretty big dead zone, so for playing shooters is just not good at all, you can't aim, is way harder than with a ps3 controller. So with that in mind i started using it for other games, say, Dark Souls, and in this one, as aiming is minimal, performance is better, but still, there is an issue with the d pad. When pressing down or up on the d pad, about 3 of 5 times, it also press left or right. Maybe is that i have big fingers, but this never before happened withe the ps3 controller, so i think is the size and design of this one.<br /><br />With that in mind, i would say buy it... IF you plan on playing rpgs, or games that don't require precision aiming, wich aren't many these days.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|This is one of those movies you see coming to the theater and say, &#34;It does not look interesting to me&#34;.  But then on DVD or to rent you do it just to see what it was about and you are pleasantly surprised.  Well this IS one of them.  There is a lot of action and the action is VERY Bloody (So no kids should watch) also the movie has to do with a drug called &#34;Slo-Mo&#34; where when the person is on it, they see things going VERY slow, and sometimes that is when they get shot, so the bullets fly threw their bodies VERY Slow and it looks pretty sick.  But it had a pretty good story, and Urban (Bones from the New Star Trek) and Olivia (His partner) are pretty good in it.  All in all, it was a pretty good movie, but again, not for the young ones.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|I loved this book.  So much unravels, things that you don't expect happen. I was addicted to this book. You would be too.
1476733953|5.0|I hadn't heard anything at all about this book before reading, and had no idea it was so popular, much less that the film rights had been bought.  I was desperate for some new reading material, and it sounded interesting.  I think he does a wonderful job with a premise (post-apocalyptic-like Earth)that is not new.  The characters are engaging, compelling and well-written, though some characters come and go without much development, as is the case with many stories.  The plot lines have a few twists, and he begins to examine some interesting issues about humanity and the world he has created. The book sucks you in and makes you want more when the last page is finished.  I hope the other books are as rewarding as this one!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I like Facebook so much bc i can talk to all my friends any time i want so this is now my favorite app ever
B006LSZECO|5.0|I could not put it down.  A must read.  It kept me guessing and wondering what was going to happen.  It also made me feel a bit angry.

B0002XDODU|5.0|Being that this is Rammstein's 4th studio album (behind Herzeleid, Sehnsucht and Mutter), I don't think that I need to explain why Rammstein is such an excellent band to anyone. The album Reise, Reise once again proved to me, and countless other fans, that Rammstein can do no wrong, and is always progressing as a band.<br /><br />The tracks included on Reise, Reise are: Reise, reise, mein teil, Dalai Lama, keine lust, los, Amerika, Moskau, morgenstern, stein um stein, ohne dich and amour. There is also a 30 second clip that plays before the title track Reise, reise, and it is the last 30 seconds of Japan Airlines Flight 123 before it crashed on the 12th of August 1985, killing all but 4 of the 520 people on board. This was a very powerful, yet somber, way to start of Reise, Reise, and it really sets the tone for the album you are about to hear.<br /><br />The album opens with the title track reise, reise, a very heavy, no nonsense track that really gets the album going quickly. The following tracks: Mein teil, Dalai Lama, keine lust and morgenstern (which is my personal favorite from the album) all follow this same style, and they are all incredible. Then you have the tracks Amerika, which pokes fun at the commercialism of American culture, and Moskau, which speaks of Moscow's beauty (through the lens of Prostitution). Both of these songs are very catchy with a hard rock tempo, and they showcase Rammstein's use of humor perfectly. Then you have two tracks called ohne dich and amour, both of which sing about the positives and negatives of love. By slowing down the instruments, and the volume of Till Lindemann's voice, you get two beautiful and powerful songs.<br /><br />Once again I am amazed at the talent of Rammstein, their music never gets old to me, because they are always trying to progress their sound, while still staying true to what made them famous. Reise, Reise is amazing, period.
B005BGBP3Y|4.0|Surprised that the movie mirrors the book... Hopefully, they'll do the continuation with Something Blue; one can only hope. Enjoy it.
B004VOBIE8|5.0|great way to keep track of downloaded files that the device is not able to keep track of its self.
0375869026|5.0|I read this book because my grandson, age 9, highly recommended it to me. Wonder is written in a simple, forthright manner, but the story itself causes one to reflect on it long after reading it. This is a beautiful book, artfully written. I thank my grandson for bringing it to my attention.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Another great book by Rick Riordan. The Lost Hero kept me on the edge of my seat, and kept me coming back for more!  I can not wait to start the next book in the series.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Cool show like the timeline from past to present. It will be more interesting as the plot develops in the next full episodes.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a fun game for kids I love it is amazing. I am very proud of you guys Thanks kk1905 :)
B00E978FGQ|4.0|Good movie, not great but worth your 90 or so minutes. The magic is a bit of a stretch however the ending isn't predictable
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The best show on TV ever!  I could hardly wait til the next episode.  EVERY character has an incredible storyline and the writers take you from one to the next with amazing excitement.  Very emotional at times with surprising endings.
B00ABLJ5NQ|5.0|I Don't know wether this book is  science fiction, mythology ,  a remembrance of lost childhood,  poetry in prose, or what.  I just know I bought it because I loved the cover: it reminded me of &#34;The water babies&#34;, A book I loved when I was young, and still love.<br /><br />A middle aged man returns for a funeral to the place where he lived when he was seven, and which he had forgotten...<br /><br />This  was my first Neil Gaiman. I was instantly hooked, and read it twice in a row, to savor every bit of the story, and of the way it is told. And when I finished the second reading, I bought and read &#34;American Gods&#34;, and &#34;The graveyard Book&#34; , also by Gaiman, because I needed to get my fill of his writing. And I plan to read all the rest of his books.<br /><br />If this is not a good recommendation, I don't know what is.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I had  no idea what this  book was about before I started reading it, just picked up on a whim.  In fact I think this was the first Steven King novel I have read.  I will certainly be reading  more King novels after this.  Great read, one of the best I've read in a long while.  I love  the subject of time travel,  this one ranks right up there with the best of them.

B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|Was ok, unfortunately if you watch a lot of horror movies, you will see and predict the ending well before it gets there. I personally dislike movies that give away too much.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Really enjoyed the premise of the movie and the way it played out, even if it was slightly predictable for most sci fi fans.
B003L77G38|5.0|The series had so many twists and turns so many weird creatures concepts it Me entertained but it also makes you think about things what might or might not be possible I ended up buying the entire set I believe it was 6 seasons they always came packaged very well and the only issue I ever had was one of the discs had a slight flaw in the seller rectified it quickly and without any hassle I recommend them to anyone that enjoys science fiction and mysteries at the same time
B000FCK65W|2.0|I think of this book as a book written more for girls. I thought this book had  a good story but it wasn't the book for me.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Just like the Mahjong I amuse to playing.  It has multiple boards and multiple choices of tiles.  Great family fun!

B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Came soon after I ordered and I love all the songs from Phillip.<br />I enjoy it whenever I play it.<br />Thanks
B001MS7IBS|5.0|This is a science fiction series it is very intriguing it has mystery drama as well as a lot of special effects I found the stories to be well written, if you are a science fiction fan this one will leave you wanting more the series from season one to I believe it was season 6 is basically one long story with each one of these being a chapter of cause and effect
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is an awesome game!!! It's very mind challenging and makes u think and have fun at the same time!!
159448385X|4.0|I've kinda read through Hosseini's novels in a bizarre order, hitting the Kite Runner first, I then jumped to Mountains Echoed, and now finally have had the chance to read the intervening piece A Thousand Splendid Suns.<br /><br />And what a piece - it should come as no surprise that its set in Afghanistan, and entails a number of years thus entailing a turmoil of political and violent changes in the region.<br /><br />The two main characters, Mariam and Laila are trapped in the same marriage, but their pain is very different. Mariam has a difficult slow-burning story over many years, whereas Laila is more soap-operary, if only this wasn't set in such tragic place.<br /><br />Oddly, for a painful emotional journey type book the pace is quite fast, and you won't find the characters stuck in one place for long. In some respects this is my criticism of the book.  So quickly does Hosseini pull his characters through the story one finds themself struggling to get attached.<br /><br />The horrific drama is impossible not to feel however, and I do not recommend this piece to those of delicate heart.
B002VECM6S|5.0|During this time when there a lot of racial problems it leaves a message we can all get along. What impressed me the most is that it is a true story of a caring family.  I love the movie.

0452298482|4.0|I actually would have rated this a 4.5 had I been given a chance. This is an excellent book and one I will keep on my bedside table for for future reference. I'm also going to encourage my husband and friends to read it. I wish more people in our culture listened to our senior citizens because they have a lot to teach us. Much of the information was useful and practical. There was a summary at the end of each chapter that gives the lessons succinctly. Wonderful touch! I would have rated this a 5 had it had two changes. 1) I don't agree in most cases with the author's use of pseudonyms. Most of the people were very wise and well-spoken and I think it would have been an honor for him to include their names. I know for research purposes, he probably could not do that, but this is a book marketed to a mainstream audience and I think it would have been a fine tribute to use the names of those who gave permission. 2) I would have liked more depth on some of the interviews. Some people dealt with some really amazing things, like the death of a child, in their lives and he often summed them up in just a few paragraphs. I think they deserved more ink and I think the reader would have been better served with longer, more in-depth interviews. In some of the more extraordinary cases, I wish he would have returned on multiple occasions to capture more from them and give a better sense of how<br /><br />But despite my minor criticisms, I suspect this book will change my life. It gave me a new perspective on certain things I could improve about myself and I hope that I can take action to change the course of certain things in my life so that when I'm the age of the \\"experts\\" (as he calls them), perhaps I, too, can speak with authority about a life relatively well-lived.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|If you like to read books that are about college party lives and battles between mind games in a relationship, this book is for you.  It annoyed me sooooo much.  Do I love you? Don't you love me? Should I love you? I shouldn't love you....Gag!  That being said, I found I couldn't put the book down.  Not sure I want to pay for the sequel.  We'll see...
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Read this quick book in one sitting and it definitely has all the bare bones you need to know to build your book for Kindle.  Will definitely use it to review my book before submitting to KDP.

1433502410|5.0|I had one in the regular print but I thank you very much that it is in large print so I can now read the notes below without using the hand held magnifiers which are sometimes a real bother or not conveniently found at the time I need them.  The notes and maps and pictures are great in this version and I like the reading of this version how it flows and it is understandable without needing a dictionary at all times.

B00ATSS73U|4.0|Songs were ideal for praise and worship and made me pause to reflect on God's grace and mercy.  I enjoyed all the songs
B009QD0MYQ|5.0|What else can I say? Every song is like candy for your ears. So happy I bought the 16 track US version cuz I can't get enough!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I know other reviews didn't like the second book quite as much as the first.  However, the plot to me of the second book was more unexpected than what happened in the first.  In the first book that there were certain elements of how I knew it would end, maybe not all of the details, but the essentials(avoiding spoilers here).  The second book had more twists and turns and I found even more engaging than the first book.  Now I'm hanging in the balance and can't wait to read book 3!!
B00CBDCB0G|4.0|One of her first books and proves to be one of her best, I enjoyed it immensely, couldn't put it down<br />N
B005804NCI|5.0|I have bought Fleetwood Mac's \\"Rumours\\" in several permutations - LP, half-speed LP,cassette, CD, 2-CD Remaster, 5.1  DVD-Audion, 2013's boxset...and this 5.1 Japanese-issued SACD.<br /><br />I prefer this SACD (and the earlier DVD-Audio) version because it uses the original 45 mix of \\"Cystal Springs\\". The sound quality is superb. The 2CD and boxset remasters all used a remix. If you tamper with a recording via a remix, it should be stated. Record companies - don't tamper with consumers' memories!!
B00DHRLK84|5.0|Everybody seems to be giving this film a very bad wrap, that it doesn't deserve. It was a new and better take on the entire genre, an had me on the edge of my seat (and occasionally jumping out of it) for the entire film. If you like thrillers, this is one of the best I have ever seen. The acting and special effects are fantastic, and the plot is quite genius.<br />Buy it. Watch it. Trust me. You'll like it.
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|Not my type of movie but very, very well done. There was enough interest to keep me involved. More my husband's genre.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Just finished this game, and highly recommend it. Good graphics, story, sound. I was pleased with the length of it. I liked having a map and a notebook, and I enjoy HOGs. You can try the free, short version to see what you think. That's what I did.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I've read Ender's Game several times since it was written. Every time, I love it just a little more. It's a well crafted story that draws you into a labyrinth of mind games that become indistinguishable from reality. You can watch these incredible children being shaped or warped into the people the Battle School needs them to be, and then into what Earth needs them to be, if they survive. The worlds that Orson Scott Card create here are as riveting as C. J. Cherryh's, Cyteen, or Robert Heinlein's, Stranger In A Strange Land. If you want some light and fun reading, go for the Twilight series. Ender's Game will immerse you into another world that is not unlike a Steven King novel, intense and absorbing and horrifyingly possible.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is sweet. I love it the lair is awesome. Who is Meena????? This is awesome<br />I love it graphics r great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|Well researched and moderately well presented. There is too much repetition leaving this reader to suspect that the author has it in mind to publish any single chapter as an essay -- or worse, simply compiled a handful of previously written essays without editing them to remove redundancies that impeded the narrative flow. Otherwise very engaging and informative.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Wonderful plot, very fleshed out characters, suspenseful, unpredictable, and extremely well written.  I couldn't put it down.  A great read.  makes you think.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Its good needs more colors and designs has good flow to it and a good function it is really good
B00280LYHS|5.0|Really good not as good as the first I'm going to read the last Olympian series next really hope it is as good as this series!  I hope you will make even more percy Jackson books and movies in the future.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|If you want action and explosions, this is your movie.  Not much of a story, but it is very entertaining.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a great puzzle game! I love puzzles and the challenge. It is hard at some points but it works your brain.
B000HF6XV8|5.0|I highly recommend it.  Really love the characters and how they overcome the obstacles set before them with love.  Read the book aloud to your children and then watch the movie together.
B00CWM3F4C|5.0|I will wait until I order ANY more MP3 music from Amazon in the future. I paid $10.99 for the MP3 version of this, and now it's being offered for only $5. I guess I'm one of the saps you people can thank for it being only $5 now. You're welcome.

B003H4I4JU|4.0|I'm so glad the upcoming movie got me to read all these books, and I'm excited the  there are many more.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Another example of strength and dedication and a belief in God and thank you for sharing your story, yes it needed to be told I hope to get tone of your appearances. God bless you and your family
030758836X|5.0|The story was gripping and I couldn't put it down. Lots of twists and turns. I recommend it as summer reading.
B008602KQI|5.0|Excellent movie. Can't hardly wait for number 2. Great story and even better great actors and actresses. Recommend seeing it again and again.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Great graphics and a creative story, but the need for energy is an obvious drawback. Since it is a game that's meant to be played for a long period of time (and using energy for each puzzle or scene) it can become quite redundant, though.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book was hard to read but so good. It was so well written.  The descriptive narrative transported me to Germany.  I talked Bout it everywhere I went and wanted others to read it so I could discuss the characters.  it is a book I would like my teens to read.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|this cord will work for the kindles, my cell phone, my sons cell phone, lots of places and we have had not problems with it
B004HW7JH4|5.0|If you love Mad Men then you'll want to buy the collection before the price goes up. I heard that this year will be the last year for this show :(
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey has always seemed like one of those people you could just go get a beer with, or watch a baseball game, or share a plate of nachos. However, she is also one of the funniest human beings on the planet. This book is a great look into how an extremely funny yet comfortably normal person grows up, lives. works and deals with success while being a wife and mom.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This does exactly what is says It will do. Great free app for checking the weather in the area.  Great being able to receive updates
B00004YRQA|5.0|just what he needed. price a little higher than I would have thought, but that could just be the age gap
B003EYVXTQ|4.0|We had seen this movie awhile ago, really liked it, so decided to buy it so we could watch it whenever we wanted.  We would recommend this to anyone.  Very good movie.
B007M45PMU|3.0|I bought this album when it was a daily mp3 deal because I had been hearing a lot about The Lumineers and enjoyed the song &#34;Ho Hey.&#34; That remained my favorite song on the album, as nothing else, at least to me, seemed to compare. Not a bad album, and I will put it on every now and then when I want some background music, but it's rarely my first choice to listen to.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great series and amazon on demand is the only place I could find it early. Very happy with the series.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|Listened to this song all day, back to back, and still not sick of it. Can't wait for the ArtPop tour!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is so much fun!! But one little thing... when u run out of gru coins u have to either buy more or do achievements also revives r expensive!
B004YW4L5K|4.0|This book is long, and that's not a bad thing. I enjoyed reading the sprawling, epic story that featured a wide and diverse array of situations and a plot that made me think. I gave it 4/5 stars because it's a bit spastic. A foreword, an epilogue, a post script, a disembodied section, an author interview...it would have been nice for it to be a bit more straightforward, but perhaps that's not the Gaiman way. If you are even a bit interested, buy this book. You won't be disappointed.
0425098478|4.0|This book has a simple elegance that is very accessible and yet teaches powerful skills.  I purchase these books ten at a time and give them out to business associates and interns.  Really wish it was available on Kindle.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|my son and my sister got me started on Downton Abbey now I'm thoroughly hooked,and can't wait for the next season.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Interesting game. This game kept me interested all afternoon, I am looking forward to the next game in t his series.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five is the one most people seem to be familiar with, along with Cat's Cradle. After buying it as a Kindle daily deal, I began reading immediately and was drawn to my Kindle any chance I had. The story line is a lot of fun and keeps you interested. If you've ever had an inkling to read Slaughterhouse-Five, you should probably just go ahead and snag it.
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|Great cd! Lots of great songs. Buddy Guy at his best. Wonderful guitar work. Blues at its finest. Buy it !
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|FANTASTIC BOOK, read it and you will love it! Is is as good as it gets and as good af Fifth
0802473156|5.0|His book doesn't contain some magic secrets. And you can (like I did) find the basics of what's in it from these reviews or elsewhere online. But I will say that reading this and taking the quizzes didn't jut make my husband and I &#34;figure out what love llanguage&#34; each of us speak, it opened up a lot more in our relationship dynamic. It's a simple book that gives great info on its subject matter, but also is a wonderful tool to help you see other things about yourself, your partner, and your relationship dynamic. A good read for anyone--whether in need of relationship help/advice or not. Because its just a good way to see the nature of partnership in general.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I somehow felt it was appropriate for this to be one of the first books I purchased on my Kindle. You may know Ender's Game as the book that people are talking about when they said, &#34;WHAT?! You haven't read ENDER'S GAME?!&#34; It's a pretty solid book! The book does a good job of building a mental image while still leaving scenes to the imagination and discretion of the reader. I have not continued on with the series, so know that you can enjoy it as a one-off read or as a starting block to the Ender series.
B009G5TWFO|5.0|The battle of the Thermopylai is one of the highest point of Valor in the Western tradition. It was a seminal battle, the result of which determined much of what the world today looks like. 300 is the comic-book version of the story, where the Spartan are all He-Man-like heroes, the Persians represent everything debauched and capricious and the Spartan ideal of Tirtaeus, &#34;beautiful indeed is dying in the first rank&#34; permeates the entire movie. The quote from Simonides, still engraved at the battle location, comes after a climax of action that cannot fail but giving the chills.<br />To me, it is one of the movies I would take with me if I could only take five on a desert island.

B000FCKIFU|5.0|Why does one person have another person killed - orders, love of country, religion, money, revenge or psychosis? And just who belongs to the Camel Club?<br /><br />There are 4 members in the club: Oliver Stone (yes, that's an alias), Reuben Rhodes, Caleb Shaw, and Milton Farb. The first two are economically disadvantaged and all four are emotionally damaged, disillusioned and angry.  But they are not alcoholics or drug users and they are definitely not crazy nor are they broken. They are men who have been betrayed by life in general and by the Federal Government in particular.<br /><br />These men are not your average, stereotypical, garden-variety conspiracy \\"nuts.\\" Two of the four in the club know that government conspiracies truly exist because they were members of covert teams that actually committed some of those conspiracies. And then, during a club meeting held illegally on a Federally owned island in D.C., they accidentally witness the murder of a Secret Service agent.  When the assassins hear them, they must now run for their lives, literally and figuratively. Now, instead of just talking about conspiracies they suspect exist, they must actually expose one they know exists before it kills them, too.<br /><br />Having read several Baldacci books previously, I was not disappointed in this first of a series.  His writing is clear and concise.  His characterizations are detailed and humanizing. He makes you understand, and on more than one occasion, sympathize with the motivations of both the \\"good guys\\" and the \\"bad guys.\\" And he really makes you wonder, at times, which is which.<br /><br />This book was written only 5 years after the 9/11 massacre, and that massacre figures prominently in the background of the conspiracy story being told in this novel. Accordingly, the author makes use of info dumps, not really about the 9/11 massacre itself so much as about the ensuing governmental and military situation with the Middle East and with Muslims in particular.  However, these info dumps are positioned appropriately, used to explain a character's dialogue or actions and are not done to the point of ad nauseam.<br /><br />In this novel, Baldacci has created a thriller that lulls you with normalcy one minute and has you on the edge of your seat, wide-eyed, the next. He has also created a crew of friends and compatriots who are smart book-wise and smart street-wise.  They are compassionate and flawed but at the same time passionate and deadly. They are a very plausible group of characters and I will continue to follow them in the series.<br /><br />And not for one minute do I believe that one of the central \\"bad guys,\\" who really believes he's a good guy, is dead, either! But then, this is a series, isn't it?However, these info dumps are positioned appropriately, used to explain a character's dialogue or actions and are not done to the point of ad nauseam.<br /><br />In this novel, Baldacci has created a thriller that lulls you with normalcy one minute and has you on the edge of your seat, wide-eyed, the next.

B00CPLGGXM|5.0|The inside of my pc has never looked this uncluttered. This is now the most powerful machine in the house and the tiniest.<br />This processor is phenomenal: not only the processing speed is state-of-the-art for all my usages, but the graphic card it provides packs a punch. Overall, it is the best bang for the buck around unless you are a power maven.

B00CLF80O0|5.0|Whitesnake has taken a sort of unique route in the new century.  Not necessarily remaking hits after hits compilations or releasing &#34;greatest hits&#34; live albums, but providing us with fresh studio recordings every 4-5 years that, while not matching the outstanding melodic prowess of their 80s output, still are solid albums to enjoy time after time.  Unfortunately, their albums have not matched, say, Bon Jovi's level of success in the past 15 years, so instead of offering box-office record-shattering tours every couple of years, they have successful runs on a smaller scale and capture it on outstanding live albums that never cease to surprise.<br /><br />Made in Britain/The World Record is yet another live album from Whitesnake but at the same time it has a fresh quality that makes any naysayer have to stop and listen.  Of course Still of the Night and Here I go Again and Is This Love are here... but not only the recording is definitely taking advantage of the most modern technology, the performance is a furious and inspired as if this was the first tour with those songs on the setlist.  What makes this album valuable is not those hits alone, but the inclusion of minor hits that normally don't appear on other live albums, as The Deeper the Love and Burn/Strombringer (recently available on the Good To Be Bad Special Edition's Disc Two).<br /><br />Also, worth mentioning, a great 8 minute take on Ain't No Love In The Heart of the City.  Granted, the Made In Britain disc (Disc one, track 1-13) is an almost identical reproduction of the Made In Japan track listing, but again, for any Whitesnake fan (and you'd have to be to be reading this) the fresh take that those virtuoso guitar players and rhythm section give to the songs make it a unique experience well worth the price.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I was really looking forward to this game, but it won't open. It just tells me there is something wrong with the download. Someone let me know if they ever fix it.
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|Beware, once you start playing this game it is very hard to stop. It's fun for pinball fans, but the addition of Star Wars makes it out of this galaxy!
B00B2TUKI0|3.0|I expected a unique take on old favorites from Madeleine Peyroux, but I have to say this CD simply doesn't measure up to her earlier ones.  The musical arrangements on several of the selections felt awkward.  I can applaud the &#34;blues&#34; concept ... but the final product is not, I think, a good reflection of her creativity and one-of-a-kind voice.  I will continue to enjoy her earlier CDs and look forward to the next &#34;new&#34; one.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I was hoping for another Twilight, Hunger Games, or Divergent.  While this was a relatively quick read it wasn't a page turner.
1905236042|5.0|Excellent large cards. Perfect for use with children and step by step instructions! Would consider buying more from this company.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|There are some really good performances, in fact a lot of  really great material in this 2 disc package! It has been my limited experience with the Pink Floyd Pulse concert and with this collection that the attention to detail, full rich sound, and the quality of the recordings have been outstanding. Great mixing, great depth and soundstage presentation and great, clean, full spectrum sound from deep bass to the high notes of the Stratocasters. The second disc offers not only more great music performances, but some personal glimpses of  Mr. Gilmore's personal life, his recording, writing, work perspectives, and his devotion to music. There are also some candid views of the other associates, backstage and on the road, and their personalities as well. There are many, many hours of  real music pleasure in this collection, I do recommend it!

B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game especially the bingo and slots love the fact u can interact with so many people all over the world only draw back is I can only manage to do 2 card as I'm not quick enough my fault not urs :-)
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Really great sound! The video and sound mixing of this concert is a real treat! The mixing of the music creates a very life like soundstage with real depth, placement, and full spectrum music from the deep powerful base and drums to the pure highs of the Stratocasters as only Gilmore and Waters can deliver. The stage design has evolved from the Division Bell concert (see: [...] \\"approximately 700 tons of steel on 33 trucks\\" to a seamless, non-stop sonic and visual sensory experience that will take you back through some of the history of  Pink Floyd's best! Even if you don't have a big screen and a powerful sound system, this two disc set will deliver. If you do, get ready, settled in, crank it up,  and be prepared for a great time!!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Started playing bingo blitz on Facebook about 2 years ago.Now I play on my Kindle hd. I have never had a problem with the bingo or slots games. They are very addicting.
1401324649|5.0|Delightful, refreshing, burst-out-laughing funny, and an all-around great read!  It's sort of a Forrest Gump-type romp through famous events as narrated by a 100-year-old man who escapes the nursing home.

B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|In chapter 8 Aslan, in talking about Capernaum on the Sea of Galilee states &#34;The entire village stretched along a wide expanse of the seacoast, allowing the cool salt air to nurture all manner of plants and trees.&#34; Oops. The Sea of Galilee is a freshwater lake. This is a very easy fact to confirm. Much easier than the events of 2000 years ago. If he can't get this right then forget the rest.

B004UPANGM|5.0|This titled is marked as having closed captions however, the captioning didn't work. I couldn't watch the movie because of this. So I had no choice but to rate it one star. The other movies I have purchased so far have had captions that worked so perhaps this one was just improperly labeled? Anyways, I hope the captions work in the future. Totally bummed.<br />Edit: this movie has captions now. The movie itself is campy genius! Now it gets 5 stars!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Just when you think that John Grisham has exhausted all possible story lines, he is able to spin a plausible, engaging tale.  I have always been a Grisham fan & I appreciate the way he tells his story without all the unnecessary profanity.  Keep up the good work!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Amazing! Not only can you see the new cards in action, but old cards come back. Even without the full version, this game is a blast!
B0013UIUBC|5.0|I'm a big fan of Zeta-Jones. Her acting in this movie is totally admirable. It's not completely a comedy. It's more a drama. Has some really sad scenes, but I loved the scenes of French desserts and Zeta Jones shinning in her job. I loved the way she did her best to make the little girl happy and her honesty.
B00992CF6W|2.0|It stinks all you do is fight zombie and create stuff.  I would give it two recommend that you don't get this game. I would give it two stars. It gets boring after ten days.<br /><br />NEVER GET THIS GAME. It's a waist of money. Here's a game you should get plants vs zombies. It's awesomeness. I would give it 5 stars. I'm now done here folks see you.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This book may just be a teen book made to draw us in but it goes so far beyond a love story. While reading you fall in love with the characters, wish desperately for happier endings and for things to be different. However, if story was compromised in such a way it wouldn't be believable, you wouldn't sob uncontrollably like I was as everything deteriorated between Augustus and Hazel due to unfortunate odds and circumstances. The story stays with you because of the truth behind it and how it connects on a deeper level trying to talk about death and comfort people on the topic of love lost.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I introduced my eight year old to Nausica through this purchase. She now loves the movie, it is a favorite go to on movie night.

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Very well researched and expressed book about the HISTORICAL Jesus of Nazareth. It offers great perspective on the difference between what's written in the Bible, what it's original intended meanings were, and how the message got lost through time.

B001D0BLTA|4.0|I always enjoyed this movie and I still adore Molly Ringwald! You can't go wrong with an 80s romantic comedy!
B00A77II0U|5.0|I enjoyed playing this hidden object game.  The storyline is very good and interesting.  There are many many hidden object scenes and a few puzzles with the right amount of difficulty for me.  I would have liked to keep playing longer, however.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Love the effects and the challenge of each level ... I really like being able to play this game at any time.

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Be careful! Its addicting!  Can't wait for season 4 DVD! The characters are greatly cast & acting is great! Get it!
067101756X|5.0|An incredible read - it is hard to put the book down for bedtime! The massive amount of cover ups the Government has used is mind boggling. It also provides an interesting correlation with modern, as we know it, wartime machinery.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This is the sort of games you get to love: it is simple, can be easily replayed, makes you think and is relaxing. What's more, you do not have to kill anyone, but have to save little creatures. Absolutely great!
B000FC11JW|4.0|Says much worth hearing. Not surprising advice but it has remained relevant. Especially the decision-making steps and emphasis on managing to strengths were well put. The 60s prose is more verbose than we're used to, but livable. Same for the period-appropriate Mad Men-type sexism. Am already adjusting my self-awareness toward effectiveness, not just action, so a win overall,
0802114970|5.0|This is an outstanding book.  I've been fascinated with Henry all my life, but now feel I have a more intimate understanding of the personalities of these women.  It is very well written and I have now purchased another book by Alison Weir and will likely continue to do so.

B0089XH38M|4.0|But yes, phones and most notably Android ones are vulnerable. This antivirus does the trick without being invasive: good find!
B009JZWO3I|5.0|The Good Wife brings everything full circle in Season IV.<br /><br />Julianne and &#34;Mr. Big&#34; make the season a great one... Eli and Will Garner keep things &#34;splashy&#34; and interesting. Great cast on this show, they make the stories compelling, believable, and make you want to watch more... The Guest stars are awesome and the cast continues to be amazing, as usual. I breezed through this season episode-by-episode. The character Elsbeth Tesioni is a favorite and she returns this season. There's nothing like a glass of wine and The Good Wife.

B00ATDOVNK|3.0|The game play is alright. I do enjoy hunting for items, but the fact that it only allows you to go so far in the game and then charge 4.99 to continue playing... That seems a bit much.
B009AY04A8|3.0|I downloaded it for my daughter helps her with memory visualizations<br />and matching. She and I love it. A little competition doesn't hurt.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|A very entertaining, very clever and inventive novel.  The author managed to make this a nostalgia trip through all the best aspects of the Eighties and at the same time, his story is set in the future.  What he really wrote about is the present.  This is a story that takes place mostly in cyberspace and embodies the growing tendency of our society to favor virtual life over mundane reality. Weaved into that is the contrast between who we are when we are logged in and who we are when we are logged out. As much as this is a mostly fun indulgence into the world of video games, movies,television and the on-line experience, there are some serious issues touched on including the neglect of the real world as millions retreat from it to live their lives on line.<br /><br />One thing that did surprise me is the writer's abundant use of cliches.  Among them are \\"dime a dozen\\", \\"rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic\\" and \\"all hell broke loose\\".  And it wasn't like these stock phrases were used ironically or were upended or revised.  Mr. Cline is much too good of a writer to let these slip in.  But that's nit-picking. This novel is one of the greatest mash-ups of all time, an emblem of the decade.
0345525558|5.0|This is one of the most engaging stories I have read. I loved the symbolism with the flowers as metaphor for life. Hard to put down. Can't wait for her next book.
0345530578|2.0|I am glad I read this .  It was OK.  I am not a Grisham fan so I hesitate to review<br />this book.  However, I did read it.  I was a bit confused when he changed subjects in<br />in the middle of the book and developed an entirely different plot.  Naturally the story<br /> came together in the end, but I floundered around in the dark for 50 pages. The story line<br />was about an attractive, smart lawyer who was imprisoned and felt hostility toward the<br /> federal government. He felt wronged and planned an elaborate \\"get even\\".  His<br />revenge IS the story.
B00BTHV05M|5.0|One Republic. This CD that should have some broad appeal. It sounds good playing in the background and when you turn it up loud you can't help but get caught up in the music. Lyrics for everyone, beats that move you, great vocals, awesomely orchestrated.
B004AM5QT4|5.0|Great story...keeps you on the edge of your seat! This is the first book by this author that I've read...definitely not the last.
0399255370|5.0|Several of my friends that have daughters that teach in the primary grades have asked to borrow this book for a classroom writing lesson. It is a great story that invites a lot of discussions and imagination. My grandson loved the book. Just one look at the pages of this book, you'll want to purchase it.
B004XUMMFE|4.0|Just found about this series. Was way too late but thoroughly enjoyed the creative scripts and solid acting by all.
B003ASLJS6|4.0|It was shipped on time and packaged right.<br />Yes, I would recommend it to my friends<br />It was a good movie, just all fo Clint Eastwood's
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Everything about it is excellent. A must watch for anyone that loves to be entertained. It is beautiful, romantic, sad, happy, funny, much like life, just a different era.
B00DFBVKCS|1.0|I've bought the vinyl edition, which is really low-priced. The vinyl is totally skewed, it is absolutely impossible to play this record.<br />I would return the record, but due to the high shipping costs to Austria, it makes no sense.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I was mesmerized and couldn't put it down. Moving from the past and present day while keeping true to the  basic premise. I would highly recommend this book for everyone.  Especially for those who have been adopted or those seeking their own children given up for adoption.  Very well written
B005D9MUWY|5.0|The best keyboard to date! Got the whole family using it the best predictive text, auto cap at the start of new sentence.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Love this show! The sarcasm is great humor! I recommend to anyone and everyone! So glad I randomly picked it to watch
030758836X|1.0|It's Immature, poorly written, short on vocabulary (vulgarisms), politically correct. I would give it half a star if I could.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I'm still pretty confused...But it's held my interest. I don't think this would ever  become a favorite, but it's a good &quot;right now&quot; game.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Will written, nice flow, easy ,entering read.  Nice to find a new author, even an Aussie.  Will read more from her.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|The story of Lavina is an unlikely one, but enjoyable nonetheless. You can be a part of the story as it unfolds, I wanted to know what was going to happen to each of the characters as they developed. The history of the American South can be a harsh one. I was a little disappointed in the ending, a bit weak for a strong story.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|The game seems to be pretty fun so far...I didn't give 5 stars only because I don't like energy games...besides having to have &quot;energy&quot; to play it's a lot of fun and you won't realize the time you're playing for...
0321934318|5.0|This is a more advanced book on Lightroom. After you already have a working knowledge of LR, it's easier to get through. It's pretty much my Bible for editing. I've been waiting for this!!
0743270754|5.0|Rarely do I &#34;tackle&#34; a book of this size except on vacation.  Once I began, I could not put it down for more than a day.  Besides being a comprehensive study of Lincoln's political career, it proves beyond doubt the great genius of a great man.  For a man who had difficulty believing in an afterlife, it is the best portrayal of a politician of rare Christian virtue, especially that of forgiveness, discipline, and deep concern for the suffering caused by war.  Doris Kearns Goodwin showed outstanding qualities both as a researcher and as a writer.  As many others have noted, it reads like a novel, holding one's interest from start to finish.  I have recommended this book to many of my friends as a rare find.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i find it more interesting than subway surfers! Alot more graphics and fun! Lots of traps and catches too. I enjoy this game anyday. takes a while to download but its 100&deg;/&deg; worth it my friends!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love it!  Can't wait for Season 4.  It really holds your attention and gives you insight into how the elite lived.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I loved this read. Cheryl Strayed's  journey on the PCT was not only physically challenging on her body and feet, the emotional release of her past along with challenges of the wild made this a book I didn't want to put down. Excellent.
B000002HRE|5.0|Just getting into the MP3 stage and loading my iPod with loads of great music. Timely delivery and good music. Certainly would do business with these folks again
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I hate to put it down. It is relaxing too. I have to be patient  and wait for more coins. It is a great free game.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|I've loved this game since it was premiered on armor games. I'm glad to see I can get it on Kindle now.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Very interesting characters and story.  A remarkable author with a great grasp of the english language.  I highly recommend this book.
B00000J2SS|5.0|Haven't had the chance to listen to this yet, but I am a big fan. I am sure it will meet my expectations in both quality an certaiinly the timliness in delivery.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Really enjoyed this, found myself unable to put it down, hints are helpful without giving too much away. Graphics are very good and the puzzles are very clever
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Upset that the writers may kill off Matthew Crawley. I am in love with his character. I'm looking forward to season 4. Can't wait for it to be available.
B00AW8VUDG|5.0|Awesome album, glad I made the purchase. Hope to see them while I am living in Europe. Definitely old school rock.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|Engaging! I have not enjoyed a book so well since I read Anne Rice. Witches and vampires and historical notes.
B008EKOIN8|5.0|I'm a fan of Michael Pollan's writing: it's never preachy, and always very thoughtful and well researched. What I particularly enjoyed about Cooked is how he ties the concept of cooking in with the other books he's written. I feel Pollan is adept at pinpointing what is wrong with our current food system. The solutions are very simple, but overlooked by our society. This book has also inspired me to make my own kraut!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love how easy it is for me to open Facebook on my Kindle Fire HD. Thanks to the producer of this great app.
B008BRC7BE|5.0|Two great Rockers, two great bands and great old school stuff. Awesome music, great purchase. Add this to any rock collection.
B0000062FL|5.0|Classic.  Love this album end to end.  Perhaps on my top 25.  Some great nuanced licks, I will never forget.  A boiling pot of popular music and its own genre.  Cool cover too.  :)
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|DW is always a favorite, little cheesey, but good stuff. They definitely needed a bigger budget, but they made it work.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|This is a fun app for something to do when I can't do anything else like waiting for an appointment. I don't find it as enjoyable as those on my big screen computer but fun as I enjoy the challenge of matching games.
B009AY04A8|5.0|Although there are many hidden object games out there the ones from Nevosoft are always good. I have played several and liked them all.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|The story is so great, you don't want to put it down. I haven't watched the movie yet,but I'm sure it can't be as good as this book. I read it in no time because it was such a great read.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Great series. It left me thinking after every episode, trying to figure out who the murderer is. Excellent little show. Love the British shows.
B008K6HN8I|3.0|I tried downloading this on my Kindle Fire HD and some instructions came up for me to download something else or do something that I did not understand so I deleted it from my device.
B000PUV1ZI|4.0|Amazon Streaming could be a little more responsive when seeking, but the picture was clear and the movie is a classic.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Ive walked passed this book about 100 times at Target in the last 2 years, not looking twice at it. The cover is a little misleading, I would have never thought it was a romance. I decided to buy it on my Kindle after seeing its great reviews. I really love this book, I couldn't put it down, read it all in less than 24 hours. But I'm really not sure what it was that kept me so intrigued. Travis was pretty psycho, what 20 year old horny college student wouldn't be after the mind games Abby plays with him? I did think Abby got annoying at times, and was indecisive, but she is 18/19 after all, and most teenage girls are that way. Their relationship is a little odd, they both like each other, but both refuse to say so, even though they act so. The things that happen illegally in this book are looked over a little too easily, it would never happen in the real world. Going to bars and gambling in Las Vegas strip casinos? Come on now. Those little things bugged me, but overall I really did love the book and have recommended it to my friends.
B00A3CVFMM|3.0|The selection had great sound quality, but is a shortened version of the song. I was disappointed with my purchase for this reason.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I like the game but I don't like the fact that as soon as the last number is shown it shuts you out and doesn't give you time to mark your numbers. I have missed a lot of bingos because this.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|Jennifer Lopez, the black comedian, some other parental couples having their baby.  They all ended up being pregnant and happy and in love, lol.  The comedian said \\" he just punch his dick if he is sad \\" lol. You have to see it.
B005FISBTO|5.0|Love all the Dexter shows and since I don't have it on tv, I wait a year or two till the price goes down on DVD then I snap it up.  Could watch 24 - 7.<br /><br />Amazon always does a great job to make the buying experience easy, painless and true to their word on delivery.
0070511136|5.0|If you hate sales, read this book and learn a new approach that makes sense.  If you love sales, read this book and discover how to improve your technique.  The research behind this book is exhaustive, and the technique is so organic, you may discover you're already using it.  In that case, you'll be able to improve your skills.<br /><br />I hate sales, even though I've had sales training.  It just never seemed to fit the situation for me.  This book does.  It's the first I've read that distinguishes between the characteristics of one-time and relationship sales and between small sales and major sales.  The author isn't telling you how he does it, he's telling you how top sales persons in a variety of business do it successfully, distilled down to the SPIN approach.
B00421IR5I|5.0|I learned to love Petit Nicolas in original book form when I was beginning my teaching career.  Now my French students not only enjoy this little rascal but they are practicing their French as they watch!
B00CO4KGYA|4.0|There's no point in writing a long - winded review about graphics and game play. It's a cell phone game, and Amazon allows you to see what it looks like before you buy it. And as it's a Free App of the Day today, you're not even paying for it. If you are later, then look at the screen shots. As for the game play, it's exactly what it sounds like. I'm sure there's a story, but let's be honest here. You're not going to follow it. You're going to tennis ball some faces off. And for that, I congratulate this game for being honest about what it is.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|There's a lot of things to do for free. Easy instructions and hints. With Kindle Fire the seek and find games ate hard to see even when you enlarge it.
B008JFUNTG|5.0|This is a story about special children growing up with absentee fathers who attempt to win their children's love with gifts while being worshiped as gods. In this installment Percy (Logan Lerman) and his friends go after an old sheep skin in order to save a tree. Meanwhile, bad guy Luke (Jake Abel) wants the fleece so he can revive his ancestor, Cronus known for eating his own young. Guess how that works out.<br /><br />The film opens with a slight monologue to reintroduce the characters. Like the Potter series, the main character's acting in the low point. This film also has that hidden world within our own world aspect. The scenes boasts wonderful special effects. The individual scenes are more overpowering than the general plot designed to appeal to the pop culture youth. Leven Rambin was made up to look like Jennifer Lawrence running around with a bow. One can't help but draw to mind the block buster films of &#34;Hunger Games&#34; and &#34;Potter.&#34;<br /><br />This series seems designed for those slightly younger than the Potter crowd. The characters and plot lack the complexity and certainly less occult darkness.<br /><br />A great film for the family to see, especially the older kids who aren't prone to nightmares. Contains a family message as Percy must learn to live with a half brother who is a cyclops.
B00B9366VO|5.0|Great documentary. Very interesting to see how music is made and how many great songs were recorded there. Highly recommended
B0063IH60K|5.0|Really enjoyed playing solitaire with my Mom as a child.  Love it even more as a adult. Hours of entertainment. A really nice game set up.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I really love the dynamic between Martin Freeman and Benedict Cumberbatch. Since day one, I've loved how absolute Dr.  Watson's and Sherlock's bond is.  Also, even though I knew before watching series 2 that another season would be coming out, I still cried my eyes out at the the end of this DVD.
B000ICXQUQ|4.0|A great fathers film but the ladies will enjoy it as well. A interesting walk through the history of how baseball was during the twenties and thirties and how it pieced itself together into a live fantasy dream park for a man who's father was a professional ball player but never had time for his son. It could have touched on the negro league's issues as well and that could have made a good yarn into one of the greats. I guess having James Earl Jones as a famous voice of the sixties/baseball fan in there was a way of dodging that issue. Still it was a very enjoyable film.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Weather prediction is never exact but the weather network does a pretty good job for our area at least. I've used while travelling as well and have kept dry or enjoyed the sun because of it.
B001ILFUDC|2.0|in the amazon.com write-up, as well as on the box, it indicated that the movie had a spanish language option. after numerous attempts, both by me and others who know plenty about computers, it was clear that it did not have a spanish version (the menu indicated that it did as well, but a spanish language version was not accessible)
B004132HZS|5.0|I've never really been a fan of Sherlock Holmes, so I was ready to hate this series. Even when I heard that Benedict Cumberbatch was playing an updated version of Sherlock, I wasn't impressed. However, when I realized that the show starred Cumberbatch and was created by Steven Moffat (showrunner for Doctor Who), I raced to my local library to check-out this DVD the next day!<br /><br />I was hooked on this show from episode one, and was aghast when I realized that there were technically only three episodes per DVD. I didn't even realize that I had sat for four hours watching Cumberbatch and Freeman...basically they fell in love with each other, and the audience falls in love with both of them.<br /><br />I think my favorite part about the whole series is that even when Sherlock is a douche and everyone is totally against him, Watson sticks up for him from day one.<br /><br />I know the show runs on PBS here in the states, but I really recommend buying and/or renting [from the the library] the DVD set due to the show being edited for the US broadcast. The editing is slight and doesn't take away from show overall, but I know I preferred the non-edited version.
B001J3U22S|5.0|Do not read it expecting Frank but enjoy what is a very fun read and I find myself just as engrossed in this part of the saga as Franks books. Who can not want more Dune?
B0033H7VI6|5.0|This is a tremendous value, price for quality.  If you're looking for a fairly large, tough, heavy duty, outdoors knife, this is it.  It is built to last and sharpens easy enough.  I can't emphasize how tough this knife is with a full 1/4\\" spine and tang.  It can easily hack trough small trees and do any basic knife work.
B00A9C3RNQ|5.0|These are two of my favorite actors/actresses and the movie was great to see these talented folks take on such everyday roles.  It is a sweet and funny movie and so glad that real love wins out again.<br /><br />I could not imagine lesser actors/actresses in these characters.  The subtle way Meryl moves her body and face is amazing.  Tommy Lee Jones shows an equal effort in his mannerisms and language.  Great movie for lots of reasons.
0321934318|5.0|Even if you have earlier versions of this series this worth adding to your resources.<br />Kelby at his best. 5Stars
B003U4UNPK|5.0|Re-watching this has been very enjoyable - so far.  Another good season.  Just wish Amazon's streaming service worked a bit better.  Has been very inconsistent as of late.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I read the great reviews. How wonderful they are for studios and mixing. I read about the frequencies and low response and sound separation vs this overpriced or that overhyped headset. Since I am not in the music recording business, I do not have the luxury of knowing what is quality and what is not.<br /><br />Worst, Like some off you, I suffer from hearing loss. As we all get older we lose our higher frequencies. In my case I feared my hearing loss would negate any beneficial craftsmanship the headset could offer. Because they are mass produced and popular, they are reasonably priced. So I took the chance. I owned a nice Bose headset years ago, but my wife's puppy chewed them up one night cutting her teeth, the little monster. I was hoping to be at least as good as that set even though they are at half the Bose cost. These are truly heads and tails above my old BOSE set.<br /><br />I was stunned when I put them on. Sounds I thought were lost were there and more. Now I know what everyone was talking about when they referred to sound isolation. It is like standing in a room with the musician. Instead of the guitar and the singer intertwined in a mushed melody, they separate and complement each other. It is really amazing, I don't think some professionals realize the impact such headphones have on people who haven't tried the best. You know their worth, we don't.<br /><br />So if your holding off because your ears are not quiet what they used to be, don't. If anything, get them because of that. Everyone needs a bit of excellence in their lives to compensate. I think they taught me that I might not have lost as much as I thought.<br /><br />Is there a downside? Actually there is. I can now tell when something wasn't recorded correctly, it sounds awful. I don't how or why, but I can hear the messy result. Thankfully, only a few songs in my collection had to go. I can just imagine what professionals are hearing with their trained ears on that mess.<br /><br />You don'thave to be a professional to enjoy these. They sound just as wonderful sitting on your head on your recliner.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|I loved the way the movie began, started one guessing about the characters and actions right away but the middle of the movie was so predictable.  The ending suprised you again.  Overall, it is a sweet movie but two gorgeous people meeting and falling in love so quickly is a bit too hollywood for me to want to watch a second time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Just like temple run but minions instead. I like this game because u don't have to purchase content o keep playing
B006MW3V6U|4.0|The characters are all very believable. It offers an insight to another way of life, through the eyes of the rich and the poor. A refreshing escape from our fast paced society, as it is today.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Alright thats not exactly true. I love this thing. It is so much fun all my family and friends get into it. It is only single player so I think i need to get more at some point but it is really challenging and fun at the same time.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is very entertaining!  I learned  about it from my nine year old niece, and I live it just as much as.she does....maybe even more. I just wish the token/coin things were easier to get for free.
B00B1E6FF8|1.0|Here's a better movie idea, how about a movie depicting  how the CIA helped create and spread islamic fundamentalism all over the third world to combat soviet, communist, secular democratic nationalist influences and challengers to US imperialist interests in the third world. Depicting how bin laden was Reagan's holy warrior against the Soviets in the 80s. How the taliban was put in power by the US. How Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with 9/11 or bin laden. Or had any WMDs. How the US government lied and invaded Afghanistan and Iraq because they need to dominate that middle eastern oil.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|That's all I have to say the best scratch that my helps me get up in the mornings save a lot of stress for me.
B006RXQ800|5.0|If you do not mind violence this is a great film. It is a period piece historical account of the &#34;know nothing party&#34; but quirt embellished. It is well made and entertaining.
B009CGGDP4|5.0|Timeless story well done movie great movie for the family to watch together. This is one that is popular on long road trips with my family so is great to carry along on the Kindle Fire.
B000003S5H|5.0|This is a great downtempo style album.  I've got several of their records and they're all great.  Air has been around for a while.
B001K3ENEA|1.0|I bought these headphones at Guitar Center for twenty dollars for me Mums portable CD player. She is happy with them...much better than the throwaway headphones that came with the player. Considering their price point here on Amazon, I was expecting some major performance. Far from it. The real price point for these headphones, is, well, 20 dollars...and maybe not even that. In a side-by-side listening test, my twenty dollar Sony MDR-ZX100 headphones sounded WAAAAY better than these AKGs. These AKGs sound muffled and dead in comparison to the Sonys.<br /><br />My advice, buy the Sony MDR-ZX100 headphones instead of these. If you are willing to spend more money, I would suggest the Sony MDR-V6 Monitor Series Headphones, currently eighty-eight bucks here on Amazon. Those headphones ROCK!!! I use those for my home recording studio.<br /><br />Hope this helps. :o)
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Maybe I am getting older, but I find this game very challenging! I always run out of time before I can find everything. The graphics are excellent, overall I am loving this game.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|got to have more levels! very challenging, it took me some time to solve the puzzles but it wasnt to difficult for me to solve, great game!
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|This is a great album, but it's very short.  I hope she is working on new material.  She does have another EP with 2 songs, Tennis Court.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Everything about this book seemed real.<br />Fast pace and always kept me wondering the outcome.<br />Very enjoyable reading and plan to read more of his writings
1250030951|4.0|So, you're burnt out on the New Adult genre.<br /><br />You've read 30.5 books this year about fictional girls having the same college experience, like they are in some sort of perverted episode of the Twilight Zone. They have all been raped, abused, or raised by wealthy parents who do not care about them and keep them from the one they love, but its ok because after one roll in the hay with the reformed bad boy, these girls have life figured out. They get over their past, they stand up to their parents, they pass the test and save the day.<br /><br />And you're just over it.<br /><br />Yeah? Me too.<br /><br />And that is probably why I loved Fangirl and Cath so much. Because her college experience did not read like a Teen Harlequin novel. It read like my life.<br /><br />\\"Look at you. You've got your s*** together, you're not scared of anything. I'm scared of everything. And I'm crazy. Like maybe you think I'm a little crazy, but I only ever let people see the tip of my crazy iceberg. Underneath this veneer of slightly crazy and mildly socially retarded, I'm a complete disaster.\\" -- Cath, to her roomate Raegan<br /><br />I loved that the angst in it was so subtle and yet I kept having these little electric waves of emotion roll through my chest on Cath's behalf: as she's navigating her classes... as she feels betrayed when her identical twin doesn't want to be her roommate and finds a new best friend... as she's struggling to feel comfortable in her own dorm room because she's living with a fairly intimidating (yet ultimately awesome) upperclassman named Reagan... as she reluctantly begins to interact with other people and learns the hard way that some can be trusted and some are just using you to get ahead... as she falls in love for the first time. All of the tension in this book felt authentic and not overdone, not over-the-top, and yet left my heart a little bruised. Because this is the angst that real people experience their freshman year of college, and I saw myself in it.<br /><br />With that being said, I'm not kidding when I tell you Cath is the opposite of the typical NA heroine. She's awkward and has a bad case of social anxiety and is more firmly planted in her internet reality than actual reality; but she is also endearing and smart and Rainbow Rowell helps us understand her.<br /><br />I've never written fanfiction, or read fanfiction, or even really been aware that fanfiction existed, but the point of the book was not to make me a fanfiction groupie. The point was to show the journey of one girl's first year in college, and that girl happened to be an incredibly talented writer of fanfiction. Cath writes slash fiction about Simon & Baz, who are the main characters in a Harry Potterish series, and there is quite a bit of talk about her fanfic throughout the book. Even though I can't identify with that personally, it didn't turn me off like I expected it to. Throughout the course of the book it even grew on me because Cath was growing on me, and I cared about her. Also, her roommate was there for comic relief and to say the things that most of us would be thinking if we were actually interacting with Cath.<br /><br />Quotes from her roommate Reagan:<br /><br />\\"What do you mean when you write them? No, you know what? Nevermind. I don't want to know. It's already hard enough to make eye contact with you.\\"<br /><br />\\"You're just so helpless sometimes. It's like watching a kitten with its head trapped in a Kleenex box.\\"<br /><br />Cath is sometimes frustrating because you want to rush her, to force her to make the right decisions and to stop pushing people away. But that's why this is a coming-of-age tale and not a romance, although the love story in it gave me a true case of \\"the feels.\\" It was well done, sweetly and slowly built, and even though it wasn't totally believable (he was almost too perfect) I was rooting for both of them.

It's extremely chaste. But if you love character-driven stories with humor, realistic dialogue, and a sweet love story, this is one of my favorites from 2013.

B008KE3960|3.0|You have to play many times to get the gears so you can buy stuff or you have to buy them from amazon
B0091V6TJ0|3.0|I agree with the other 3 star review. If you are new to the music of Can, definitely start with their first half a dozen or so albums.<br /><br />This is a collection from their archives of out-takes, experiments etc. Sonically interesting, some really good studio & live pieces, & the 10\\" reel to reel packaging with booklet is nice, but the CD's just sit in cardboard holes, like another reviewer posted. So not that great. But I believe there is now a more standard digipak version available.<br /><br />Anyway, I would recommend this set only to already fans & or completists.
B00CCXL9OE|4.0|Good transfer overall. It will hold me over til Disney releases a blu ray with extra features.  If your a fan of this movie, then you should buy this.  Good family fun.
B009IJJ712|5.0|very unique and just hours of fun. jonny lee miller and lucy liu are a delight to watch on the small screen!
B005BO4OY8|5.0|Movie is a bit of a sci-fi, suspense, mystery, comedy, romance, military - seems to have a little of everything to appeal to everyone.  Really enjoyed the story line and the plot.  Sitting on the edge of my seat for parts of it!  Would definitely recommend it.  A few instances of crude expletives might make you want to screen it before letting your kids watch it.  Thought it was OK for my teens.
B00B22ASUM|4.0|Really liked the book. It was straight from the heart, and very realistic. Showed how friendship, compassion and trust can help over come adversity. Sometime all you need is a friend to show you the way. Sometimes the best friends are of the four legged variety!!
B006LSZECO|1.0|Waste of time and money. I think the author ran out of ideas and didn't know how to end it. Really, really bad ending. If there is a rate less than 1 star, that will be my rating . That's how bad this book is.

0307352153|4.0|I'll start with the good and then go into the bad.<br /><br />The book Quiet was an interesting read for me as an introvert. I think it helped me to understand myself better and to see how my own talents can make me a better leader, even in an extroverted world.<br /><br />As a leader, I found the reading even more interesting as it explored the ways in which groups accomplish, or don't accomplish, their tasks. An interesting reflection on the nature of human interactions, this book is a good read for anyone interested in learning more about those interactions.<br /><br />The book, however, is not a \\"fun\\" read and I found it difficult to motivate myself to finish it in the midst of graduate exams. It's certainly not what I would choose to read in the evening when my time is limited--there are so many more interesting books to read.<br /><br />So, in the end, while I would recommend it as a great resource for introverts, extroverts wanting to understand introverts, and leaders wanting insight on leading large groups, I would not recommend this book as one to curl up with. Perhaps it would be better as a resource than as a book to read cover to cover.

B00ECUARO8|4.0|Aside from some initial difficulty in understanding the two boys the initial part of the movie was charming.<br />Mud brought a new complexity to the boys' lives. The acting was quite strong as the boys and Mud tested one-another.<br />The film picked up in intensity as it progressed however the viewer never knew with certainty what was true and what wasn't. Uncertainty persisted as to the existence of love and &#34;who the characters really were.&#34; The ending was not fairly tale but satisfying.<br />JEF
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Great Read.  I loved the background information.  The twist at the end was great this was one of the few mysteries that I did not have the guilty party until very close to the end.
B0050SYS5A|2.0|I've tried adjusting it many different times and ways using online tutorials but this was a waste of money. I wanted to expand my playing space and all it did was give the games a hard time to recognize my form no matter how many times I calibrated the Kinect.<br /><br />It may work for others, but it didn't for me.
B002KKCVS2|5.0|I've been wearing Tevas for years, and these are one of the best pair yet.  They fit great and feel good.  Only the original Wraptors (produced about ten years ago) out-performed these sandals.
B005PK56TA|1.0|I love a good horror story, but the plot was so sexed up and preposterous, I turned off Season 1, Episode 1 before it ended. I would allot four stars to Jessica Lange's performance, which was stellar, but even her character couldn't buoy up the thin, cliched screenwriting in this pilot episode. I don't think I could bring myself to watch another episode.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I enjoyed this book but it was predictable. No surprises but good characterizations.I would not recommend to my book club.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I have gone back to reading Sherlock Holmes stories after watching BBC Sherlock - Cumberbatch and Freeman - and falling in love with the show.<br /><br />At some point through the first story (Study in red) I stopped abruptly because it mentioned the horses - I had forgotten, by the wittiness of the dialogues and modernity of the tale, that we were back in the original Conan Doyle stories....<br /><br />Definitely I will enjoy all of them.

0470876417|5.0|I liked the examples and the easy to follow concepts presented with a wide variety of graphics.  The book is very well thought out and great for entrepreneurs trying to find a way to put their thoughts into a logical and organized construct.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I have taken the Myers-Briggs test several times over the last 20 or so years. On the first dimension, extroversion/introversion I have scored near the middle in all cases. After reading this book, I know that how we relate to others is a more nuanced and variable thing than a simple label.  After reading this book In some cases I completely saw myself as an introvert, in others less so.  In some cases I was clearly extroverted.<br /><br />While helpful for me personally, I found this book useful also in my role as a manager at my work.  I lead a team of software engineers, kind of your archetypal introverts, I guess. For years I have espoused an open seating plan for the teams I lead, on the premise that it fosters communication and teamwork. It certainly does for me. But my efforts are often thwarted, lately with headphones and music, and a slight adjustment in orientation that allows team members to avoid eye contact with others. Both defeat any purpose I had intended, and showed me that my well-intentioned efforts were counterproductive. Now I more fully understand why.<br /><br />I have read many books on how people behave and why.  This one seemed like it might be the same old thing as I have encountered before, but instead, I found an engrossing and focussed study of one aspect of our human behavior. In many ways I think having a more complete understanding of introverts (and thus extroverts) would help motigate many of the daily conflicts and confusions I see both in my personal and work life.<br /><br />The book sometimes goes a little far, devolving at times into ways to handle extreme introversion, in particular with children. But it's still a well written and carefully explained coverage of a topic I thought I knew a lot about, but didn't.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This book left me breathless.  A great addition to the series and the emotional intensity is off the charts.  Thank you Nalini!

B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I love this CD. I like all of the songs. There are only 12 songs on the album and I would have liked more to listen to. But hey, Bruno's the man. I want to buy a hat like his too.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|There's so much to love in this film; the cast, the songs and the cinematography.  Having seen Les Mis on Broadway I was wary of a film version, but this film was true to the show in story and song.  I would have given it a five star review if someone other than Russell Crowe played Javert.  His singing was adequate but stiff, as if he were trying too hard to sing and not hard enough to act.  Where is Terrence Mann when you need him?
B007IXWL2C|5.0|All the hype I heard before reading these books was true - all three books in the trilogy were excellent

B00AQ71FLK|5.0|This is a lot of fun the action is great with cool abilities the strategic part of the game is a lot of fun and challenging the graphics are really good also
B00C7JFIRC|4.0|I saw this in the movie theater in 3D and loved the look of the film and was afraid it would not translate well to DVD.  Well, I'm happy to say that the BluRay version is wonderful; all the color, sound and beauty of the original.  I don't miss any of the 3D effects at all because the cinematography and CGI in this film are top notch.  I also like the story and how well it touched upon themes in the original Wizard of OZ.  The china doll is an especially touching feature.  I'm glad I bought this because I know I will view it many many times.
B003TOMAPC|4.0|Not a bad plot and an interesting movie.  It stars Nicholas Cage's Hair as well.  Had to check it out before watching #2

B009NG1Q96|5.0|This book blew me away! At first I was wondering if this book could top the first one. And it did! It busted through all my expectations and then some! I ended up reading this in one day! I sat down and just peeled through it. America has some decisions to make. Can she be a princess? Is she cut out for it? Now that there are only six girls things are going to get tougher. She has to make a decision though. Maxon or Aspen? Maxon doesn't know he's competing with Aspen, but Aspen knows what he has to lose. And he seems to think he should fill America's head with how he sees Maxon. In between all of this the palace gets attacked. The rebels are getting more assertive. In the end Maxon seems to trust America and gives her a lot of room in the trust dept, but he's now sure what he's going to do if America doesn't choose to be with him. He has to make sure that if America decides she can't be with him and take the job that one of the other girls is enough for him. And that seems to place even more stress on the situation. What should America believe? Maxon? Aspen? What she's seen with the other girls? What the others girls have told her? It's all just so much to take. In the end will what she knows be enough for her to make this decision! This is a definite must read and I seriously cannot wait for the third book!!!

B00BMKDTNC|4.0|The ending of these types of series always seems rushed but I enjoyed it. It reminded me of a tv series that gets canceled mid season and rushes to wrap it all up by the last episode like FireFly the movie tried to wrap up the tv show.
0765334798|3.0|A straight trope transplant from Star Trek the original series, this occasionally funny novel puts the protagonist into the expendable red-shirt throw-away character.  I read it in a couple hours and barely remembered it three weeks later.  I didn't like it as much as other Scalzi novels; it lacked that oomph of a new situation (remember, settings, etc. are Star Trek analogues... late-middle book totally reminded me of the Star Trek IV time-travel movie about humpback whales), and the sarcasm could have been better.  Scenes revolved around punchlines instead of the jokes being the chocolate sprinkles on top of the story.  Characters have a tendency to come off as 'author voice' smug as they move through deconstruction of the main cast.  Codas at the end book brought it up from 'mediocre' to 'OK'.<br /><br />Recommended to people who appreciate hard-core sci-fi fans in full cosplay stuttering through an imitation of Shatner-as-Kirk.  A book sci-fi convention groupies would love, but not 'hard sci-fi' or suitable for a general audience.  Won the 2013 Hugo for \\"Best Novel\\", but far from the best sci-fi I've read this year.  I like Scalzi's stuff, and do think he's a great sci-fi author, but this was a campy, niche piece, not something that people centuries from now who use the Hugo list for reading recommendations will enjoy out of cultural context.
B009AY04A8|3.0|Has a good story of cursed pirate booty over 16 chapters, leading up to a cliff hanger and teaser for part 2.<br />Each chapter has seek about five sections each with a find objects by name and then by picture, find the differences, and find objects in the dark with a light. It shouldn't take too long to find most objects; some scenes are dark though and a little difficult to see everything, even when zoomed in, but there's unlimited help when you need it (with a cool down period). Each part has a 10 minute timer, which can be turned off in options. The hardest time I had was finding the differences, because you couldn't zoom in on those scenes, making it hard to see everything on an android phone screen.<br />The dark scenes had you moving a circle of light around to find your objects. Your finger was always in the center of the circle, making it hard to see, and thus you had to keep tapping to move the light. If you moved around too fast though you get a clicking penalty of 20 seconds. This wasn't a problem for me, as I found most objects with over 7 minutes to spare, but some may find moving the light around decreases their time too much.<br />Overall nice story, quick play through; not always easy to see everything, but on a phone that's expected. Not worth 2.99$ though; I picked it up as a FAOTD.

B00EHAIHWM|5.0|Let me start by saying that Franz Ferdinand has a unique sound and sensibility. A new album from FF will ALWAYS be welcomed by me.<br /><br />For fans of previous FF albums you will find several songs that harken back to their \\"glory days\\".<br /><br />Love Illumination and Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Actions sound like songs you could've found on previous releases (not a bad thing) but the 3 songs that caught my attention the most are:<br /><br />Evil Eye<br />Bullet<br />Treason! Animals<br /><br />So in conclusion, this may not be the best FF album but it is still an awesome album for fans.
1490313370|5.0|I greatly enjoyed this book for its complete and total honesty. Sometimes in life, we're all gonna get knocked down, humiliated, whatever other negative emotions may result, and so what we do next is up to us. It's about valuing ourselves by taking care of ourselves, see the Daily Practice, and knowing that our failures do not, and will not ever define us. I really enjoyed his examples of people like Sara Blakely of Spanx who Chose Herself in order to make her ideas come to fruition. She worked hard to achieve her success and think everyone can learn from her confidence and determination. Each person is responsible for their own success and it's up to us to make things happen without wasting time waiting, hoping for someone else to make it happen for us.<br /><br />All of the chapters included something of value and I really enjoyed How to Become an Idea Machine because it's good to think deeply to push ourselves; to make our brains really sweat in order to reach our full potential. Also, resentments are a waste of time and energy. I like how he addresses that there are no exceptions for keeping people around who do not support our goals, including family, friends?, etc.<br /><br />Although not all the advice is applicable to me right now as an engineering student who is not looking to start a company in the immediate future. However, I will be paying for my education and working at the same time to afford this. In the future I look forward to putting my educational knowledge to use to become a better Idea Machine! Still a great read for anyone looking to add some deeper meaning to their lives and taking action to accomplish what is they choose to do.

B008JFUR10|5.0|Those who have been critical of this movie are taking the movie, and themselves, far too seriously.  This was meant to be a fun summer movie and is a great homage to the Godzilla vs. XYZ movies with a bit of Voltron thrown in for good measure.  If the action sequences had been shorter or the overall movie could have been longer then I think more would have been done with character development, branching plot lines, etc. but this movie was meant to be a mega monsters vs. giant manned robots movie, not a dramatical tour d' force.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|Anything that has more upside than downside from random events (or shocks) is antifragile. How do you \\"become\\" antifragile? First, reduce your exposure to negative losses (negative black swans), and then put many small bets (acquire options) with large positive leverage - most will of course fail, but they can't hurt you by much. In fact, you should prioritize and order all of your optimization decisions via this process.<br /><br />The most interesting part of the above strategy is that it seems to apply well beyond your financial portfolio - that's the premise and the focus of this book. Nassim Taleb covers topics as wide-ranging as health and fitness, parenting, education, to career and financial planning, plus dozens of others. You may disagree with some of the examples and drawn conclusions, but this does not take away from this work - a stimulating read and one that everyone would benefit from.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I'm normally drawn to the stronger Science Sci-Fi books, started reading Asimov in elementary in the 1970s. But this book does a good job of building the world without dwelling on it to much, OSC gave enough detail that i built the world around it.  He made the characters and events real enough, you feel their pain and pleasure. You love them and hate them.<br /><br />I must admit I only picked this book up after finding out there will be a movie.  I'm interested to see the movie, but always love the books more, so picked it up. I wish i had read it in high  school or boot camp as i think it would have had a stronger  effect at that time. All in all a good book, bit of a quick read, with good characters.

1481130331|5.0|Milan Kundera opened his novel `The Unbearable Lightness of Being' describing the street where he grew up and how the name kept changing depending on the political heterodoxy of the time. In `The Luck of The Weissensteiners,' also set in Czechoslovakia, in Bratislava, we are introduced immediately to Greta Weissensteiner and learn that she is likewise subjected to sweeping changes beyond her control. A bibliophile who speaks several languages and reads her favorite German and Russian authors in the original versions, she is bubbly, pretty, anxious for life.<br /><br />The introduction of Germany and Russia puts us in the time frame of those tense years before the outbreak of World War Two, two decades before the setting of Kundera's novel, but dealing similarly in the themes of identity, nationality, shifting ideas and shifting frontiers.<br /><br />Greta, her head filled with stories of passion and loss, falls for Wilhelm Winkelmeier, a bookseller from Berlin, and he is immediately besotted. He is a German Catholic. She is Jewish - the seeds sewn for a great and troubled romance that takes us into and through the war, `The Luck of the Weissensteiners' being the first book in Christoph Fischer's epic trilogy of two families who suffer and survive.<br /><br />I called up Kundera's name because Fischer has the same oblique style and concentrates on the slow steady construction of his characters until they are flesh and blood people that we know as intimately as our neighbors and friends. His story portrays struggle, romance, separation and, ultimately, redemption in a way that is both moving and totally believable. The moment I finished this book I clicked into Amazon to find the second book in the trilogy. That says all that needs to be said.

Perhaps the last great film of Christopher Reeve's career, and one of the most ever beautiful woman and actress' refusal to mention the magic of this movie of both her and Christopher can only be a tribute to both. The music can be described as \\"magnificent!\\". To know one element requires that you know all the elements, and then you'll truely know what magic means.

B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|\\"The Jesus that Aslan wants to present is the 'zealot,' which is to say, the Jewish insurrectionist intent upon challenging the Temple establishment in Jerusalem and, above all, the Roman military power that dominated the land of Israel.\\" In other words, Reza Aslan's Jesus is someone very like Reza Aslan, who appears to be intent upon challenging what he sees as the establishment in Washington (although he himself is actually the quintessential establishment figure) and, above all, the U.S. military that he thinks dominates the lands of Islam.<br /><br />To wit: Aslan is a Board member of the National Iranian American Council (NIAC), which has been established in court as a lobbying group for the Islamic Republic of Iran. Said Michael Rubin: \\"Jamal Abdi, NIAC's policy director, now appears to push aside any pretense that NIAC is something other than Iran's lobby. Speaking at the forthcoming 'Expose AIPAC' conference, Abdi is featured on the 'Training: Constituent Lobbying for Iran' panel. Oops.\\" According to Charles C. Johnson in the Daily Caller: \\"Iranian state-run media have referred to the National Iranian-American Council (NIAC) since at least 2006 as 'Iran's lobby' in the U.S.\\" Iranian freedom activist Hassan Daioleslam \\"documented over a two-year period that NIAC is a front group lobbying on behalf of the Iranian regime.\\" NIAC had to pay him nearly $200,000 in legal fees after they sued him for defamation over his accusation that they were a front group for the mullahs, and lost. Yet Aslan remains on their Board.<br /><br />Also, Aslan tried to pass off Iran's genocidally-minded former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as a liberal reformer and has called on the U.S. Government to negotiate with Ahmadinejad himself, as well as with the jihad terror group Hamas. Aslan has even praised the jihad terror group Hizballah as \\"the most dynamic political and social organization in Lebanon,\\" as well as the anti-Semitic, misogynist, Islamic supremacist Muslim Brotherhood, which is dedicated in its own words, according to a captured internal document, to \\"eliminating and destroying Western civilization from within.\\" Aslan wrote: \\"The Muslim Brotherhood will have a significant role to play in post-Mubarak Egypt. And that is good thing.\\" Millions of Egyptians obviously disagree.<br /><br />He has also applauded and called for the forcible shutdown of the free speech of those who hates -- a quintessentially fascist impulse.<br /><br />And now he has conjured up a Jesus who, lo and behold, looks almost exactly like the conjurer himself.<br /><br />\\"Reza Aslan's Cartoon Jesus,\\" by Fr. Robert Barron in RealClearReligion, November 6:<br /><br />When I saw that Reza Aslan's portrait of Jesus, Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth, had risen to number one on the New York Times bestseller list, I must confess, I was both disappointed and puzzled. For the reductionistic and debunking approach that Aslan employs has been tried by dozens of commentators for at least the past 300 years, and the debunkers have been themselves debunked over and over again by serious scholars of the historical Jesus.<br />Here is how the method works: a scholar focuses on one aspect of Jesus's life, finds all of the Gospel passages that emphasize that aspect and declares them historically reliable, and then casually characterizes the rest of the Gospels as the non-historical musings of the evangelists and their communities. So in the course of the last three centuries, Jesus has been presented as, exclusively, an eschatological prophet, an itinerant preacher of the kingdom, a wonder-worker, a magician, a social revolutionary, an avatar of enlightened ethics, a cynic philosopher, et cetera. To be sure, evidence can be culled from the Gospels for all of these identities, but the problem is that these portraits invariably fail to present Jesus-in-full, the strange, beguiling, elusive, and richly complex figure that emerges from a thorough reading of the New Testament.<br /><br />The Jesus that Aslan wants to present is the \\"zealot,\\" which is to say, the Jewish insurrectionist intent upon challenging the Temple establishment in Jerusalem and, above all, the Roman military power that dominated the land of Israel. His principle justification for this reading is that religiously motivated revolutionaries were indeed thick on the ground in the Palestine of Jesus's time; that Jesus claimed to be ushering in a new Kingdom of God; and that he ended up dying the death typically meted out to rabble-rousers who posed a threat to Roman authority.<br /><br />Jesus, he argues, fits neatly into the pattern set by Menahem, the heroic defender of Masada, Judas the Galilean, Simon son of Giora, Simon bar Kochba, and any number of other revolutionaries who claimed Messianic identity and who, in the end, were ground under by the Romans. On this reading, Jesus indeed died on a Roman cross, but he didn't rise from the dead; instead, his body was probably left on the cross to be devoured by dogs or the birds of the air.<br /><br />Now questions immediately crowd the mind. What about Jesus's extraordinary stress on non-violence and love of enemies (hardly the stern stuff we would expect from a zealot)? Oh, it was made up by the later Christian community that was trying to curry favor with Roman society. What about Jesus's explicit claim that his kingdom was \\"not of this world\\"? Oh, those were words placed in his mouth by John the evangelist. What about his practically constant reference to prayer, the spiritual life, and trust in divine providence? Oh, that was pious invention. What about the stories of his outreach to the Woman at the Well, the man born blind, and Zacchaeus? What about the healing of Bartimaeus, the raising of Lazarus, and the raising of the daughter of Jairus, actions having precious little to do with anti-Roman activism? By now, you can guess the answer and I trust you see the problem: huge swaths of the Gospel and the early Christian witness have to be cut away in order to accommodate the portrait that Aslan paints.<br /><br />The most massive difficulty with Aslan's interpretation is that it cannot begin to account for the stubborn fact that no one except specialist historians remembers Judas the Galilean, Menahem, or Simon bar Kochba -- but everyone remembers Jesus of Nazareth. The clearest indication possible that someone was not the Messiah of Israel would have been his death at the hands of Israel's enemies, for the Messiah was supposed to be a liberator and conqueror. And this is precisely why those failed revolutionaries were so quickly forgotten....that they disbelieved in ghost-survival. On the contrary, they believed in it so firmly that, on more than one occasion, Christ had to assure them that He was not a ghost. The point is that while believing in survival they yet regarded the Resurrection as something totally different and new. The Resurrection narratives are not a picture of survival after death; they record how a totally new mode of being has risen in the Universe. Something new had appeared in the Universe: as new as the first coming of the organic life. The Man, after death, does not get divided into 'ghost' and 'corpse'. A new mode of being has risen. That is the story. What are we going to make of it ?<br /><br />The question is, I suppose, whether any hypothesis covers the facts so well as the Christian hypothesis. That hypothesis is that God has come down into the created universe, down to manhood--- and come up again, pulling it up with Him. The alternative hypothesis is not legend, nor exaggeration, nor the apparitions of a ghost. It is either lunacy or lies. Unless one can take the second alternative ( and I can't ) one turns to the Christian theory.<br /><br />' What are we to make of Christ?' There is no question of what we can make of Him, it is entirely a question of what He intends to make of us. You must accept or reject the story.<br /><br />The things He says are very different from what any other teacher has said. Others say, 'This is the truth about the Universe. This is the way you ought to go,' but He says, ' I am the Truth, and the Way, and the Life.' He says, ' No man can reach absolute reality, except through me. try to retain your own life and you will be inevitably ruined. Give yourself away and you will be saved. He says, ' If you are ashamed of Me, if , when you hear this call, you turn the other way, I also will look the other way when I come again as God without disguise. If anything whatever is keeping you from God and from Me, whatever it is, throw it away. If it is your eye, pull it out. If it is your hand, cut it off. If you put yourself first you will be last. Come to Me everyone who is carrying a heavy load, I will set that right. Your sins, all of them, are wiped out, I can do that. I am Re-birth, I am Life, eat Me, drink Me, I am your food. And finally, do not be afraid, I have overcome the whole Universe.' That is the issue.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Strong writing makes this interesting and entertaining, supported by sound acting and good casting. I watch 3 episodes at a time....
B005HJWWW8|1.0|Order placed on: March 24, 2013<br />Delivered On: Friday, March 29, 2013<br />Dead on: Sept 2, 2013; 2:32am.<br /><br />Pass on this! Will no longer hold a charge for 8 hours or even 8 seconds. The last few months, I have not been able to use any of the sound enhancement features, as the sound would distort. I figured it was starting to crap out. Ugh.<br /><br />The battle of decent sound that doesn't disturb others, continues!
B0000AYJXR|4.0|Jordan, Bugs, and the rest of the gang. Classic. A great supporting cast makes it worthwhile while also portraying Jordan's move back to basketball from baseball after retiring from basketball.
B004J4WN0I|4.0|Great read!  It's like verbal popcorn, one chapter is not enough.  For the Dresden fans, it is an easy fit.
B008S4YZCO|4.0|It's an amazing game. A mix between the classic Pokemon style of fighting with the Facebook (farmville, CityVille, etc.) game style gameplay. It's almost addicting and very good for kids. Although having many amazing traits... there's just one MAJOR problem. It shuts down in my face all the time for no reason at all; I had this app since it came out, and it's always had this problem, so I highly doubt it's going to be fixed
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Great keyboard. Takes a little getting used to at first but wonderful after that. I highly recommend it to anyone who does a lot of texting.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Django Unchained has to be one of the most gripping movies of this decade.  Jamie Foxx is extraordinary in the title role.  The rest of the cast is equally adept.  Tarantino doesn't disappoint.  The script is well written, including some occasional comic relief.  It is bloody beyond description, but that didn't keep me from giving it 5 stars.  Be prepared for gut-wrenching scenes, brutal frankness regarding slavery, and a superbly acted movie that will keep your attention to the last moment.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|No fancy graphics, just plain and simple to use efficiency. When your tablet is running slow and full of junk you downloaded and forgot about and never use any more this is the app you want. Freed up 460mb on my first use. Highly recommend it.
B007SGM084|5.0|Still reading the book but love it so far! Can't put it down once I start to read it !
B0050DIWFC|2.0|Good story. Bad language! If I want to hear locker room language, I can go to the local high school and hang out with the football players. I expect an author to rise above locker room talk. Only read a few chapters.
B0038YWPZS|5.0|It was as I remembered, only better.  It was my era and my part of the country.  Lots of extra scenes.
0316044695|5.0|SEALS are special people...driven to perform mentally and physically way past even very dedicated military troops.  Each time I read an account of their activities I come away with more respect for them.<br /><br />This is a serious book about a deadly mission. It's well worth reading.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book was chosen because everyone was rating about this book and I purchased it for my husband to read. I also read it and I loved the book but, was disappointed that, how in life you need to have the experience to Believe.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|DVD's were used as a present to my wife.  She has always tried to see the movies, but due to the lengths and times the movies showed in our area and her work schedule, that never happened.  She now has that opportunity and has not wasted anytime.  She has stopped reading the books and become totally emersed in the dvd's.<br /><br />THANK YOU AMAZON!!!
B001NLKZUA|4.0|Loved the book towards the end, if only the beginning and middle would have been more like the action packed ending!

B000A6T1JU|2.0|THE MOVIE IN ITSELF IS CLASSIC, IT'S TOUCHING ENERGETIC, AND AT THE END WHEN SWAN AND THE GIRL GET TOGETHER YOU CHEER, BUT THIS VERSION OF IT IS BLAH!!!<br />I HATE THE DIRECTORS CUT, AND I'M LOOKING FOR THE DVD OF THE ORIGINAL. (ORIG I HAD THE VHS)
B002Q4TKAY|5.0|The product was received at the time and in very good conditions. If you like this band, I absolutely recommend it
B002MFX0RQ|5.0|I've always loved this movie...It's quirky and warm and oh soooo funny!  I'm glad I finally found it so I could own it.

0784011710|5.0|This is a beautifully acted version of the book. Somehow I missed this movie when it first came out, have alway wanted to see it., Having read the book, I was not disappointed.  It is one of those movies that stays with you, which you go back and ponder from time to time, even though it is terribly sad.  The acting is truly splendid.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|It was a fun romp with all kinds of magical powers that the world just may still have! I am on to the next one!

B009NY43NY|5.0|Great last book of the series. Ended the way it always should have, I feel. Still sad that I will no longer get a look into Sookie's crazy, hectic, sometimes scary but always joyous life.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I will probably go on to read other books in the series when I get time.  It held my interest to the end.
B00138KFYO|5.0|I always love to listen to her music - too bad she died so early in her life. She really knew how to belt out a song.
B001AQQR2S|1.0|Anyone who thinks this movie is appropriate for children or anyone for that matter should have their parent qualifications examined. Not only is it tasteless and sadistic,it is full of ridiculous stereotypes, exhibits child abuse, intentional cruelty to animals, and shows that criminal activity can go unpunished if people are truly bad, all with Danny Divitos soothing voice telling us that somehow this is all for the best.  What a load of crap. I actually felt scarred after watching it and can only imagine how a movie like this could negatively influence a small childs mind.  I do not see the \\"message of love\\" that the trailer claims.  Why would anyone spend money on this movie when there are so many other thoughtfully produced didactic children's movies?
B0050DIWFC|5.0|The author was able to hold my attention throughout the entire book. Till the last chapter I was not sure about whom had committed the crimes. .I've even bought another book by the same author and so far I am enjpying it.
B000IHSKUM|5.0|The fit was perfect and they look great.  These are really comfortable and I know will last a long time.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|awesome videos - awesome price - awesome professionalism. will definitely recommend them to family and friend. thanks again for everything
B005K0HDGE|3.0|Time travel writ large and small.  Small:  The café owner being able to make his hamburgers so reasonably priced because he kept buying hamburger at 1950's prices and selling them to today's customers.  Large:  I guess if saving JFK prevented 50,000+ Americans (and hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese) from dying, a like number of others had to die in other ways to balance things out.  I guess, but not really sure.  I'm beginning to believe King topped out with The Stand.
0385751532|5.0|i havent read it yet, school hasnt cover it up. it looks good, like a new book, no writting or hihglights inside.

1439193630|5.0|THIS WAS A FUN SURPRISE.  THE &#34;ON WRITING: A MEMOIR OF THE CRAFT&#34; WAS A SUMMER READING ASSIGNMENT FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|My little brother and I liked the game. You should buy if you have annoying brother. It will entertain him and you.
0307720950|3.0|It's tough to write a book on a fast-emerging topic.  Author Chris Anderson deserves some credit for trying to both teach us about the emergence of do-it-yourself design and on-demand manufacturing, as well as looking years down the road about how these innovations might change our world.  Unfortunately, the field is so amorphous at this time that Anderson doesn't have a lot of detail on which to hang his arguments, and so he either repeats them endlessly or he sticks with vague, optimistic statements about a better future.  Basically, he's pumping a magazine article into a short book for entrepreneurs.<br /><br />I don't work in information technology, software, social media, or any other aspect of the computer world. So maybe I'm ignorant about how special this world can be.  Certainly, Anderson is a believer.  He writes with heavy-breathing optimism about the new world created by computers and, especially, the networked computers of the Web.  I'm look at computers and the Web as having a more limited utility: great tools to handle specific jobs.<br /><br />My other problem with the book is that Anderson makes sweeping statements that just aren't true.  One example: \\"A service economy is all well and good, but eliminate manufacturing and you're a nation of bankers, burger flippers, and tour guides.\\" Huh?  What about teachers, environmentalists, writers, web developers, farmers/food distributors, and the entire system of government.  I'd argue that manufacturing is falling in importance because we don't need more stuff.  Who doesn't have as many TVs, phones, clothing, etc., as they need --- really need?  Much of the stuff we buy at this point is purely optional, which is why a greater portion of purchases are going towards experiences (travel, entertainment, dining outside the home, education, etc.).  I think manufacturing has declined for a perfectly good reason: We just don't need as many new manufactured goods as we did when we, as a society, were accumulating them.<br /><br />Ultimately, I'm not convinced that the ability of \\"everyman\\" to build his or her own prototype products and crowdsource ideas about how to improve it will actually make much of a difference.  Do we really need more designs of lawn sprinklers (Anderson's compelling example in his first chapter) or coffee makers or whatever?  We have too many choices already --- and that's a problem that Anderson doesn't stop to solve.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|don't like bec. it is impossible to find all of the clues to get to the next level.<br /><br />we barely got through the game.<br /><br />the kids say it is stupid
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's pretty cute for now. Well see in time how long it holds my interest. It's a little slow starting, but most games are. The horse is pretty. :p
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Interesting remake of missile command with a little space invaders thrown in to the mix<br /><br />With the price of admission!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Captivating from the first page, this book was utterly and appropriately magical.  The author creates such a beautiful world, with images so vivid and mysterious and wonderful, you will find yourself smiling through the pages.  The characters are vivid and marvelous, equal to the images Morgenstern creates.  There is a carefully crafted duel with unknown, but obviously dramatic stakes; a beautiful love story between unlikely lovers, with endearing romances between sub-characters woven in between.  It is too simple to say that I did not want this book to end. I am on the edge of my seat wondering what other amazing worlds Morgenstern has created or will create.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I like it a lot. very good show with interesting characters!!!<br />All the actors do so very well, makes it so believable!!
B00000JXVK|5.0|I bought this second copy for my son who bought a motorcycle.  It is also a good look at Steve McQueen who was so much more than a movie star.

B000F5GNX8|5.0|I saw this on tv and wanted a copy to be able to show others.  I don't remember this being in theaters.  Definitely under the radar.
0545265355|5.0|This is a great series, and will make an excellent addition to anyones' collection. Gorgeous hardcover trilogy collection for young and old.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|After using just a few days I know I am typing much faster.  The key layouts make typing both easier and faster.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|came in a good time frame.  great quality and an excellent movie that I will watch again and again and again.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I didn't expect to find that my own career &#34;limitations&#34; were true for others of my gender. The choices are hard and we make them harder on ourselves. Sheryl Sandberg's book is a quick self reflection on well researched and supported commonalities that need to be discussed.
B000W8HC8I|3.0|The stories in the book are certainly good, while not being entirely believable. It is not the deepest thinker but it will keep you turning the page... I was entertained and now look forward to seeing the movie.

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|this game really is a blast for my kids. only downside is how easy it is to accidentally spend the coins they earn just by touching one of the offers.
B00D5YNQWM|5.0|This DVD was very fresh and entertaining. Tyler was in his element. Can't wait to get the next CD .
1469259273|5.0|A very long sequel to the first book, &#34;Name of the Wind&#34;, but one you read slowly towards the end because you don't want it to be over. Can't wait for book three to be released in the spring of 2014. Vivid writing, great character development, and engaging story line.
B00BP4ZNFM|5.0|SO GOOD! AHHAHAHAH!!!! We loved it. We liked it so much, we named our son E. T. He is all the rage at summer camp. People keep asking him if he'd like to phone home.
B004EPYZPS|3.0|I thought I would have liked this movie more than I did. It just didn't &#34;do it&#34; for me. Maybe because it had that Spielberg &#34;ET&#34; happening with kids as the main characters? I don't know, but I just felt nothing for them and found that I could have cared less about what happened to them, especially the obnoxious, selfish little brat who was making the film.

0525478817|5.0|Tears. The Fault in Our Stars produces many, many tears. I'm sure you've already heard this before, though. I know that almost every other book blog in existence has already reviewed The Fault in Our Stars, but I figured I'd give my two cents as well, anyway! Even though I haven't read any \\"cancer books\\", I know that The Fault in Our Stars is so much more than that. I was actually a smidge bit anxious going into The Fault in Our Stars because John Green is supposed to be this YA legend. He has such a huge fan base and so many readers adore him. In the past, I've read Looking for Alaska and while I thought it was good, it wasn't as amazing as I hoped it would be. With that said, The Fault in Our Stars turned me into another adoring reader of Green's. I don't think any other author has ever made me sob in the way that Mr. Green did, and for that, I applaud him.<br /><br />Going into this book, I was pretty sure I knew what was going to happen. Bloggers were saying things along the lines of \\"The Fault in Our Stars is one of the most heartbreaking books I've ever read!\\" That can obviously only mean one thing, right? Wrong. Because I was so confident about my predictions, I didn't expect the unexpected. With that said, don't try and figure out what's going to happen. Why? Because The Fault in Our Stars isn't the type of book to keep guessing through. Just read it, indulge, and (silently, or in my case, deafeningly) weep.<br /><br />What I liked the most about The Fault in Our Stars is that it felt so genuine. I didn't feel like I was reading a YA novel that was written by a 30 year old male (no offense, Mr. Green!) I felt like I was reading the true story of the exquisite Hazel Grace Lancaster and how she met her soul mate, Augustus Waters. Speaking of Augustus... can more people like him exist? Pretty please? Augustus is so unforgettable and will definitely stay in my heart forever as one of my favorite characters. You would think because I'm so obsessed with the main characters of The Fault in Our Stars, that I might not have enough room in my heart for any minor characters. WRONG, again! I pretty much fell in love with every character from The Fault in Our Stars besides Monica, even the characters I'm probably meant to dislike. They were just perfect, but flawed, but oh so perfect. I want to meet all of them.<br /><br />I can't tell you how many pages of this book that I bookmarked (I could... but that would take a while.) I'm not the type of reader to mark my favorite pages or passages because nothing usually captures my attention enough to make me stop reading and do it. I made sure to do this with The Fault in Our Stars though. There's something about the way this book made me feel, that I know when I return to certain passages, the same feelings will return and it'll be amazing. This book just understood me. This was definitely a huge, gushy, choppy review, but I hope you've taken everything I just said into consideration.
B00846REIS|5.0|Okay I've never read fifty shades of gray but I can say that bared to you is way better. I love me some Gideon cross and the heroin Eva is so confident and speaks her mind. I was blown away by their connection and never wanted the book to end. Great job Sylvia
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was very excited about this book from what I had heard about it. It was a disappointment. It was pretty slow up<br />until about the half way point, at which point it really sucked me in. And then the ending... Big let down! Overall, if you just need a book to pass some time it will do that. If you're looking for a new favorite, this is probably not it.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I have been playing this spider solitare game for over a year now.  it's the best game of all the solitaire games I play
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I get weary of apps which exaggerate the performance of their applications.  One of the first apps I down loaded on my Kindle fire and  has worked flawlessly ever since.
B005UBNKWO|5.0|4.2ghz H80 takes 1 ½ years so ... and follows as new. Realmente es excelente ........  and does not require a power source
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It's working great right now.  Kindle is charging much faster and also is holding the charge. Customer service rep was terrific.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|Need i say more? :)<br />Love this show.<br />And season 5 was great.  Hopefully they will keep it going thru season 6
B002Q7JYPC|3.0|got a few really nice songs but not up to what I expected of the eagles, I would pass on it and just buy the individual songs
B0053O89XI|5.0|Cant wait for Season 6, hope they can keep it going......<br />Been watching this season a lot and love the development of Sheldon and Amy
B00A69JZQU|5.0|I taught a leadership class at Rutgers University for three semesters, and used Socialnomics as one of the text books. Students felt empowered by all of the valuable lessons included in Socialnomics. It was this reading that made them realize how to use social media to create a digital brand/message, and leverage social networks to maximize the reach of that message. A very empowering message for young people!
159514188X|4.0|Easy read and entertaining  Does cause one to stop and think which is always nice<br />A bit depressing but not overwhelmingly so
B0082JYEEO|3.0|When I first got this album, I was disappointed. I loved &#34;Far&#34; and &#34;Begin to Hope,&#34; and this definitely isn't as great. Of course, every album can't be perfect. While it grew on me a little the more I listened to it, it has its hits and misses. &#34;Small Town Moon,&#34; &#34;Firewood,&#34; and &#34;How&#34; are my favorite tracks. I felt that &#34;Don't Leave Me&#34; and &#34;Oh Marcello&#34; were real flops. Spektor has a unique style that may be off-putting to those who have not heard her previous work. She does include some harsher songs in this album. They certainly have a purpose and story, but require one to be in the mood to listen to them. It's hard to rate this album, since there are about five songs on the album that I'm never in the mood to listen to, but the rest I do enjoy on varying levels. I would recommend getting this if you like her previous work. If you're new to Regina Spektor, I would recommend starting with &#34;Begin to Hope.&#34;
B000T06172|4.0|Great on a long trip to liven things up a bit. Especially if you on your way to the beach!
B005GRF2UK|4.0|Jane Eyre is a classic and numerous renditions of the book have played out in movies.  I like the one with Timothy Dalton best as it is more thorough and like the book, but this shorter version is very well done too;  the actors play the characters well.
B007HJ84ZK|5.0|Game of Thrones is sort of like the Star Wars trilogy, if Luke and Leia did a lot more than kiss and Han Solo got beheaded in the first thirty minutes of the first movie.
B00DPH7QFM|5.0|.... of the master. First off, I was very impressed with the technical quality of this DVD. The only quibble I would raise is the sound editing was a little off in places (guitar too loud, keyboards too soft, etc.). Very good overall, tho, and the video was excellent.<br /><br />From an artistic point of view, this performance strengthened my opinion that Blackmore is the greatest pure rock guitarist ever. Blues players like Gary Moore and SRV, soul-less speed fanatics like most of the young ones, pyrotechnics experts like Hendrix and Van Halen........... none of them measure up to Ritchie. Nor do any of them have his mastery of such a wide range of styles (even more obvious now, with the totally different stuff he is doing with Blackmore's Night - at 65 years of age!). And don't EVEN mention Clapton. He hasn't done anything worth listening to since Blind Faith and D&D.<br /><br />One sad thing, tho, is that this Rainbow line-up worked really well backing Ritchie up, and he appeared to be having fun, too. He even almost grinned a couple of times! Almost, but not quite........... ;-). I thought Doogie White was a wonderful choice as vocalist. Some people seem to think there is somebody out there who can mimic Gillan, Dio AND Coverdale, and that ain't gonna be. By this time, tho, October of 1995, Ritchie was pretty well burned out on R&R (he'd been doing it since the early 1960s), and was ready for something new - enter Candace. Personally, I welcome Blackmore's Night as a great new chapter in the Master's career, but this final version of Rainbow might have been really good if it had lasted a bit longer.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|I'm getting obsessed with North Korea as I read books like this, Escape from camp 14 and The orphan masters son.  All of them have told similar nearly incredible stories of life in North Korea and the triumphs and ongoing struggles of defectors.  I enjoyed Nothing to envy as Demick wove stories of real people with the political goings on over several decades.  She showed how the political decisions and decrees affected real people.  She did a great job of developing characters I cared about and bringing them all to the same place in the end through remarkable perseverance in most cases.  It was with great resistance that I closed the book and turned out the light in favor of sleep at night.  I didn't want to put this book down.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|The reviewers before me have pretty much summed this film up. I would put my money on 80% of the viewing demographic will have grown up with the Eagles and many of them, like myself, would know them first and foremost for their music. All of us have heard snippets of stories and probably read differing opinions as to how they imploded and reassembled and then generally just came and went again at random. Many of us would have been to a concert, possibly more than one and seen them in the flesh, marveling again at their magical ability to blend voices and instruments into some of the best music produced in modern times. This documentary knits it all together. There will be millions of words written online over the coming months and perhaps years critiquing this film for better or for worse.<br />I have adopted the stance that this is a group of musicians that are just as human as all the rest of us, extraordinarily gifted in their chosen fields and were at the intersection of preparation and opportunity just at the right time.<br /><br />The addition of a copious amount of personal home movie footage, some never aired before adds the essential layer to the production and wraps the package up like a tightly constructed wine. I'm sure there are many who will be watching this who will see themselves in the background of some of the footage, even at the third encores and will will be gasping in their living rooms grateful for the fact that the passage of time is the best camouflage for human recognition. Could you just imagine...\\" OMG Mom, I don't believe you did that ! How am I going to explain this to my friends !! \\"
1451695195|2.0|Sorry--I usually enjoy these types of books but there was something about this book that just didn't ring true to me.  Quite honestly, I never finished the book.  I intend to do so, at some point, and I may change my mind about how I feel about it at some future date..  I normally, NEVER, put a book down without finishing it, no matter how &#34;uninterested&#34; I am.  I feel all books deserve to be completed once begun, no matter how sorry I am at times, that I ever started some of them in the first place.  SO, I will complete this book at some point in time but not right now.  I believe, when I am ready for this book, it will be waiting for me to open it's cover and continue.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Had the myself, my wife and even our 7 year old hooked! Can't wait for the updates! Try it now!
B00006LI4S|5.0|David Gilmour never disappoints.  Some nicely deconstructed versions of excellent songs.  Nice choral arrangements and Caroline Dale's cello is transcendent.
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|buddy guy just keeps getting better all the time.this is a great cd double cd too .good tunes on both most of the songs are new.anyone liking the blues and wanted a great cd this is the one.the last few cds buddy made are great.he lives the blues and sings the blues the right way at 77 years old,hes one of the last living bluesman around hope he puts more music out.if you get to see buddy on tour please do,he worth the price.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Loved this book, I was hooked from the first page. Great storyline and characters, the author made you relate with their feelings. This book really makes you think \\"what if\\" Loved it and highly recommend it!!!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Not too bad - has some glitches, but can still be fun.  Would like to be able to get more chances on shadow cards - too far in between winning.  Meet some very nice people on line!!
6305882592|5.0|Ruth Gordon is magnificent in this story of an older woman who will NOT go gently into that dark night. In the meantime, she will transform the world of a troubled young man. Some of the car scenes made me want to cover my eyes as Maude and her young friend careen around seaside. This movie will make you laugh and, perhaps, rethink your ideas about growing old.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I go to sleep listening to the rain. A very therapeutic and relaxing app. Five stars. I love this app.
6305161879|4.0|Like most, I saw this first on the big screen. When I watched the DVD, I realized that I had forgotten much of the plot. It was definitely worth watching again from my current perspective. (Most of the movies I buy from Amazon are ones I first encountered in the 70's.) So part of the fun is revisiting &#34;old friends&#34;.  This one has some violence so take care if you have younger kids hanging around.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I think kik is a great way for friends to connect. Kik is a fun,easy way for kids and adults of all ages to connect. One of my favorite parts of kik is that you can add people to your conversation so easily. Another cool feature about kik is that you can choose your profile picture! And it's free!
B000I9UA8U|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies. It's clever, brilliant, so funny that you can't stop laughing for days. And it also does a great job of portraying the plight of the working class and of gender issues. I have watched this movie numerous times and I NEVER get tired of it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great game..very addictive. wish you could use bananas to buy coins but still fun. makes me want to watch the movie again every time I play!!
B000L43AN4|5.0|Essential to everyone who enjoys this &#34;outside the box&#34; musician.<br /><br />I must confess I listen only to &#34;Bawlers,&#34; but I do that so often that I have backup copies.  Every song is touching and even heartbreaking.
B0063M22QO|3.0|Not very challenging but better than Mahjong II. I dont have 12 more words to discribe not challenging. I cant remember for sure but hope it was a free dowload.
014050446X|5.0|This is a great little book and my 2 year old grand kids love it.  It took a while to get here from the U.K. but worth the wait.
B00E6Z0THE|4.0|This game was not too easy nor too hard.  I needed to use the hints a couple of times.  I liked that you went from one area of the map to the other just one time without having to constantly repeat your steps in the other areas.
B000AL5OZA|5.0|AGNETHA HAS THAT SPECIAL GIFT TO PUT YOU IN A SPECIAL PLACE THAT IS VERY COMFORTING AND ONLY YOU AND HER SOUNDS ARE THERE.  I LOVE LISTENING TO HER AND PLAN ON ORDERING MORE OF HER CDS.
B003TOR4EE|5.0|This is my girly guilty pleasure show. Its funny, dramatic, and emotional! I really enjoy watching it and its great to watch on a lazy afternoon.  I love Amanda and Mark. They are such interesting characters and so funny.
0385341679|5.0|Great writer, especially after the first or second book. Mature plot and writing, definitely an &#34;adult&#34; read. Would recommend this.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It gets the mind ticking. But it is very fun because it evolved concentration it is very enjoyable, I think for all puzzle solvers.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|this is another game my children loves to play since they got there new kindle fire recently 1 of many
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I've had this app on my phone for over a year. I love it &amp; rely on it daily. For temporary notes, thoughts to passwords (I have a lock on my phone), to info I want to keep close at hand. Very easy to use &amp; navigate.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Easy to learn. Fun time waster. Great graphics. Lots of different things to keep an eye on. Kids love it.
0061537969|4.0|For a person who loves animals this book was very refreshing. I always saw animals as humans with language limitations. I liked how this book explored my vision from beginning of the dog's life to the very end.  Highly recommended, especially to people who don't share the same affection for animals as me.
B00DHNB5CY|2.0|lots of screaming and unnecessary blood.  i missed the camp of the original.  could have used bruce campbel in it
B00CFITJKW|2.0|Hard to get. You don't tilt it to steer. Not such a good game. It is to hard for me.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I program my favorite song on the alarm, perfect for vacation. I highly recommend. It's a nice looking display, works great and is very handy...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is challenging but in an extremely entertaining way! I definitely recommend it!  I can't wait to play more levels!
B00BEIYH1A|5.0|[...]<br /><br />reviews of kickass 2, very good moive and great acting, to me there was more story and action to the second one, but both are really good movies<br /><br />I can not wait for kickass 3 but sadly Kick-Ass 3 will be the end of the franchise :(
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Trying to catch up on all shows before next season starts.  The title never intrigued me so I didn't watch it. Now I can't get enough!  Great characters, great acting, great stories!!!
B008OOYALE|5.0|Brilliant for all ages both me and my grand daughter play it together also my friend and I communicate through ii
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|Helen Hunt should win the Oscar for this role. She is so deceptively natural, that you forget she is an actor. William Macy is also superlative, as is John Hawkes.<br />Maybe I expected a little more sleaze because of the subject matter, but the writing, direction, and quality of all involved raise an interesting story to greatness by injecting so much humanity it is hard to review.<br />Do yourself a favor, watch this movie.<br />It`s equal is all too rare these days.<br />Movie making at it`s best.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|It is great for kindle...does not use much battery at all. Glad I found it and will use it from now on.
B0006GAOCW|5.0|Beautiful movie:<br />  1. the acting was great!<br />  Katie Holmes, Marc Blucas, Mike Keaten (outstanding, wish Fathers truly took interest in their child)<br />  the mother was the perfect wife for the President, as well as a great mother,<br />  2. Mia, Beautiful & talented.  Loved her,<br />  3.Secret Service men outstanding.<br />  WEll written, with all the perfect touches at just the right places/  Sorry. about the loss of M. Karon.<br />  3. Like Katie I love to dress up, that was my time of life.  Ladies were Ladies and always<br />  properly Dressed.  The Wardrobe was outstanding,<br />  I loved the story line, it was such a relief from all the blood & guts we see on TV.<br />Marc Blucas, was just so impressive.  I hope to see him in more acting.  I''ve seen him in Necessary Roughness.  Marc has put on a little weight, different parts require different looks, he's  a good actor., M.Keaton, you looked good, just like \\"Batman\\"<br />Marc,I will be looking forward to your future, appearances.<br />I can only tell you I bought two copies of First Daughter, and they both came from Amazon.  If you need more proof, let me know and I will furnish you with my purchase order number.<br />I watch it at least twice a day,and enjoy every minute of it.  of yes, I noticed someone mentioned it was great for maybe a 20 year old, but I am well past 65, and I believe it is for all ages, with good taste, and quality is good for all.<br />Thank you, so much for a calming, classic, story.  I suggest this for all ages, class, never goes out of style.<br />Jacque Carlo
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like minecraft pe. Now that I got the newest update, even better. Now you can finally blow up those creepers with flint and steel. Yay. Anywayz like the new update good job mojang. I hope the next update is better :).  Definitely worth paying $6.99.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great beginning of the 3rd season. I can't believe Shirley McClain joined the cast!  I still find the grandmother the most entertaining. :)
B0066W1AZK|2.0|I think that chess would be better if when you play two player the screen wouldn't flip around every time, it gets annoying and confusing.
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|Works perfectly, difficulty settings are good, allows for games with forced and non forced jumps. No complaints about this game.
B009ZE27US|1.0|So all you do is hold your finger on the box and it scans and my age was 40. Not even close to that and that's all you do its boring and stupid don't waste your time on this app!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book is a MUST read for anyone that loves pop culture, the 80's, anything fantasy, scifi or video-game related.  Great story, great characters, great action, smartly written and an absolute page turner!
B0058OUJA4|5.0|ok if you really look at the permissions on this I agree that you don't need to give it out. but at the same time if you don't want to give it out here is a thought for ya... don't get the app. great game raided by horrible reviews all based on permissions. if you think about it... you wouldn't be able to download almost any games on here if your worried about the permissions. where do you draw the line ...............
B00CU9LHY2|3.0|Look, from Siamese Dream to Adore this band could hardly be touched but by the best artists around. This collection is in actuality great. The problem is that for the main B-sides a lot of us have it and it still sounds great on that older version.<br /><br />But there are TONS of extras here. Outtakes, studio sessions, remixes, acoustic, etc. It is all here if you want it. And it's all mostly stuff we are familiar with in one context or another. This period in Pumpkins' history beyond any doubt produced the most material and more than probably higher grade per song than most any other band at the time. The thing is... do you want to pay 90 dollars for Billy and the suits to buy another house with? I got The Doors 12 CD boxset for like 70 bucks and that had DVDAs of all their 40th mixes and CDs of all their studio material. King Crimson has DVDAs and CDs for 20 of each of their albums and many of them come with bonus material as well. PLUS 5.1. You get my drift here?<br /><br />My problem is obviously the price point. I guess it is the record company who makes that decision? I have the first set in digital. Why the hell would I pay 90 dollars for 6 CDs worth of the material, most of which are outtakes and throwaways? I'm not sure either. Disc 5 is nearly the same exact disc with one added song. Disc 6 is a live performance. So is the DVD. They are decent but not really needed.<br /><br />The remastering is nice and worth it on most of the stuff. Certainly not a huge difference though. Most of it is not too crushed or anything so those that are familiar with the past couple Pumpkins' releases should find it doable from an SQ standpoint.<br /><br />On the whole nice to have a new look at what went down on these sessions but it really isn't necessary imo but for the hardcore fans. I like the it, the packaging is fantastic, the remastering great and you can't go wrong for the most part. But the price is only increasing, so if you want one you might as well get one here soon. It was 90 dollars or so at one point. Now it's 120 at best.<br /><br />I really wish one bluray would have been included with this set. King Crimson does these so much better.al stuff at absurd prices on their website, but this is too much to bear much like the Mellon Collie collection that is even more absurdly priced. You can find this stuff elsewhere for really cheap if you know what I mean. On the whole nice to have a new look at what went down on these sessions but it really isn't necessary imo but for the hardcore fans.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|This game looks and plays amazingly. I have been having tons of fun playing lately.<br />Easy controls make it interesting too.
B001UOVP1S|1.0|This guy released albums like Euphoria Morning solo. Soundgarden as a band were tops and had some of the best albums of the 80s/90s. I just don't get this crossover stuff when it doesn't have any subtlety or power to move. This is all pop machismo and hook-up trash. Nothing here will survive. I would like you to rent it from your local Captain Hook. And then come back to weep at all the five star reviews. There isn't much more to say other than this album is incredibly awkward and derivative. We like the man's voice. But without good material there is no point to this stuff. At all. He even tried to say in an interview that some of his fans think this is two years too early, or rather that he is ahead of the curve. No, dude. No.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I think most people deal with crummy dull knives and don't have any idea how much easier food prep is with a good sharp knife.  This is so much smaller and quicker than using the big steel rod for sharpening.  It folds up and tucks right in the knife drawer.  I use it at least once a week on all my carbon steel Henckel knives to keep them at peak performance.  Take care though - if you have been using dull knives, you can give yourself a nasty cut when the newly sharpened blade slices through food so easily.
B009WUBERW|4.0|This movie has lots of action making for a natural blockbuster. The plot line was interesting as well. I recommend it!
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|This is an addictive puzzle game. The solutions are also provided in case you get stuck. I reslly enjoy it.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|My kindle is in love again now she can be used for the purpose it was bought for my love of reading thank you!
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|I still regularly Black Sabbath albums with Ozzy and this sounds a lot like them.  Great music and vocals from my favorite band.  I wished Bill Ward was on the album but I cannot fault the drummer.  If you like the original Sabbath line-up this will not disappoint.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|A fun game where you collect bananas defeat evil people like Vector and knock out the competition of other minions. You can use the bananas to buy silly costumes such as the baby costume. I think that it is a fun game for kids to play while they learn how to save and spend money or in this case bananas.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|This was one of those &#34;recommended for you by Amazon&#34; finds, in my case.  I listened to the samples, liked it, bought it, loved it a lot once I listened to the whole thing, highly recommend it.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|JUST WATCHED PART 2 BUT DID NOT PART 1 SO I WAS OVERWHELMED YOU HAD IT IN!!!!<br />I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND PRIME INSTANT VIDEO :)
B009FRD8TY|5.0|I wasn't expecting to love this as much as I do.  I listen to Kylie for dance background music.  This is a lovely project, really showing off how beautiful her voice is and how much control she has.  Really nice.
B00D2ZF3GQ|4.0|I don't agree with the negative reviews and thought this was just a great scifi movie. The story was actually based on a real life event where a plane crashed and the father was injured and his son had to rescue them. The problem with the film may come from the fact that a lot of information is not given or just lightly touched on. If you haven't read the book, that's a prequel to this movie, then I would suggest doing that. The book actually take place about 700 years before the current event but it does tell you about the creatures they fight and why they can't use guns to fight them, as well as the origin of the cutlass they use. It gives you good background on the history of the people and their struggle as well as offering several short stories about the rangers that can \\"ghost.\\"<br /><br />I did enjoy this movie and thought Jayden did a great job and will be a great actor one day. Having said that, there is really nothing that stands out about the movie. It tells a decent story with decent character development and has good pacing. I'm not sure why there are negative reviews about this movie, is it because of not enough explosions or not filled with alien creatures that only serve as something for the main characters to target? I don't know.<br /><br />There was one scene in this movie that did feel out of place and that's the hawk scene. I'm not going to spoil for anybody but I felt that it did stand out and pretty much reversed a lot of what is believed to be fact or truth within the movie.<br /><br />But in the end this an example of the critics getting it wrong and this is definitely an enjoyable scifi flick so don't base your decisions on other peoples' opinions and check it out yourself.
B003ES61EE|4.0|I used the brush end of this cleaning kit to keep dust out of my lens while on a recent trip. However I didn't trust the foam pad on the other end, it didn't seem soft enough to prevent scratching the lens. They put a cap over the pad, but no over the brush. You have to be 100% sure its clean before you put it into your camera bag.
B00EOO55GW|4.0|I like this album.  I have listened to it non stop for about 5 days now.  I think it's really enjoyable.  There have been a lot of people criticizing it and you can't fully blame them.  This album has a lot of sounds that are just like other bands.  But that's pretty much what this band has done.  They have continually changed their musically style for reasons unknown .  I think that if a person listens to this album as a new artist and not A7X then they would really like it.  My favorite songs are Heretic and Planets.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|Its not a movie about a contagious and brave pilot. It's a bait and switch movie about alcohol and hard drugs.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Ive always loved uno but when i dont have the cards i will play this digital version its really amazing
B0035JRVBO|1.0|I was never able to view the movie. A refund should be in order in my opinion.  Please advise. Thank you.
B007918P1E|5.0|If you are a seasoned listener of Epica or just finding them for the first time you will LOVE this album! The choirs are amzaing and Simone's vocals get better on every album they cut! Heavy, melodic and beautiful!
B005D9MUWY|1.0|No Chinese input, I will stay with Samsung or google's own input<br />No Chinese input, I will stay with Samsung or google's own input
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Follett is one of my favorite reads. This was the spy story of spy stories, he has great insight to create his characters.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is now my primary weather app. Easy to add cities / locations. Rain graphics are easy to read and informative.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Very useful and practical keyboard, do what it says. Is great that can predict words to up three languages, really nice.
B004H4XI5O|5.0|There are so many tips and tricks in this book that if you wanted to develop a super memory you can do it.  There are also a ton of tips and tricks for everyday life that are interspersed in a great narrative to make anyone a better person.  I think everyone should read this book, and I've recommended it a ton of times.  I think my coworkers are tired of hearing me talk about it :)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Wow! I didn't have the highest expectations for this app, but got a sweet surprise! This is just like Subway Surfers, but &quot;Despicable Me&quot; themed, and with lots of new powerups (based on both movies)! My ONLY complaint would be that a lot of the characters can only be unlocked with special &quot;Gru&quot; coins, that you have to buy with real money, but I don't mind it that much. I would definitely recommend this game to any fans of Despicable Me, Temple Run, and Subway Surfers! I hope this review helps!
B0007KIFGO|5.0|This movie is a classic, well done and very entertaining. I would highly recommend it to anyone. Tom Hanks does a great job.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|best game I have downloaded in a very long time.  also bmx climb is a come along game. love it.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|stayed true enough to the original, but with pleasant surprises...a good escape<br /><br />wish we'd seen it on the big screen instead of a laptop, though
B00005JNBQ|5.0|The first time I tried to watch this movie I knew nothing about it and thought it was about the most stupidest thing I ever saw. I made it about half-way through. The second time I was prepared, and my opinion improved. The third time I recognized the movie isn't stupid--its about the average live of an average young man in America today, which, we should face it folks, is all too often stupid and degrading. Ultimately, this film is supportive, touching, and fun. More than one viewing may be required for people like me who are mystified by what is enthusiastically endorsed in American culture. No doubt it is unwarranted, but I gave this movie a five star review because the producers and director did not back off.

B00884GR0W|1.0|This app was to me a waste of money this does not reflect the gameplay which I did not experience because it would not download.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This is a very solid cable with quality craftsmanship. The length is a huge plus as you can still use your device when its plugged in. I purchased it to use with my galaxy phone and there are no issues works as expected.

B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This is a good hide and seek game. You have to wait to gain energy points to play or you have to buy energy, but it is a nice game.
B005FVNIW6|5.0|I once started reading this book when it was published in instalments in one of Polish fantasy and sci-fi magazines, but somehow missed one or two editions and never learned the whole Ender's story until now.<br />The book is totally involving, evoking deep sympathy and at times pity for the boy doomed to be the saviour of humanity. Incredibly vivid descriptions of battles in the game room make you feel that you're there, clapping and cheering the little soldiers. Towards the end you feel Ender's exhaustion as if it were your own and just pray for him to survive...<br />I simply couldn't put it down and got so hooked on OSC that right now I'm in the middle of the fourth part of Ender's Saga - Children of the Mind.

B00DU74U74|1.0|this movie was terrible, don't waste your time it was a complete mess, and i love steve carrell and the pet detective
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I really enjoy the game. There are multiple levels, where the location of the objects are different each time. It keeps it challenging and keeps it from being monotonous.
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|you cannot beat a movie that the rock is in, I just love him as a hero. this is a keeper

B00CL8D83U|3.0|Well i see that this CD is getting mostly great reviews; but having virtually everything they have ever done I was very disappointed by this new music.After falling in love with all their works in the 90's like Bilingual,Nightlife and their best of all Very, to me this music seems mostly experimental like something i might here late night in a club in Manhattan.When they released \\"Yes\\" i was hoping they were back on a path to pretty melodies and an energized creativity,..but i thought Elysium was mostly ho-hum (\\"Winner\\" as a single??) and to me this CD just seems like machines and technology.Their are 3 songs on here i loved....and a few i automatically skip over.I am really hoping they will find a middle ground again between the production side and the soaring music--ballads or dance music--that they are famous for.

1780721676|4.0|After hearing about this book, I finally ordered it.  It's exactly what I expected.<br />Interesting premise.  I haven't tried it yet, but plan to soon.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Excellent game, loved it, but there seems to be a bug in the title screen. A screen shows up before level select, asking you to get the legitimate version. You're still allowed to play all the levels, but it's a little annoying, considering I got the app from here
B007MDB71O|4.0|My wife and I we really surprised by this movie.  It was much better than we thought it would be.  I can't believe it didn't do well in the theater.  I hope enough people buy this on bluray and a sequel gets made.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I love this game. It's so great and I love how easy it is. Pick up and play it asap!
B003UBTX7C|3.0|I liked the book, but it did not keep me on the edge of my seat, like some of Baldacci's books have.
B00BVMXBDO|5.0|This series is for anyone who enjoys not being able to guess where the storyline is going - just when you figure it out, another twist changes the whole dynamic.  This actress is absolutely amazing, and is entirely convincing playing at my last count 7 characters.  I let a coworker watch who knew nothing about this series, and she cannot wait for season 2 to start either!  What makes it a stand out is that is plausible that it could happen.  It's not too sci-fi, our technology could actually make this a scary reality.

B000JMKRKC|4.0|I probably took too long reading this to keep all of the story lines straight. I have to go back several times to keep them straight.
B00004CYS9|1.0|it did notlay on my dvd player.  it is a european version  in PAL.  really what a rip off!  i blame Amazon for not knowing that these do not play in the USA.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|Great game needs card owns more often.  Ways to earn cards easier very little variety in cards without spending cash to buy cards.
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|Extremely disappointed. How strong women could marry, much less forgive such spineless men!  Did not read well, the only one I had sympathy for was Polly.
0307887960|3.0|It seems a bit too complicated for me.  I may try it later, when my life slows down a bit.
B008OOYALE|4.0|IT's a fun game full of mystery....You just never know what your egg holds inside.<br /> I like visiting other Dragon lands.
B00640UICA|4.0|I like it because it gets your mind working on how to get them to connect.<br />I would recommend this game to anyone who likes to get them to hold hands.
B00AAAKH80|5.0|I saw Florida Georgia Line on the Today show this morning and immediately went on Amazon to see what the reviews were on this LP. Well, they were right. If \\"Cruise\\" is the only song you've heard you're really missing a lot! Great album. Real upbeat. You'll be singing along in seconds. I'm not really a country song lover but Florida Georgia Line has changed my mind.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|My grandson age 6, doesn't read but as most youngsters today it is intuitive about video games. He caught on quickly and it kept his interest!
B00CATSONE|5.0|This book will amaze and disgust you. I knew most of this before because I have had a lifelong admiration for Tesla. Our history books paint people like J.P. Morgan, Andrew Carnegie, Thomas Edison with far too kind a brush. They were ruthless, win at all cost disgraces to humanity. It is easy to imagine how far we could've come without people of their ilk. Tesla is an unsung hero. He fought for his ideas, though he never profited much from them. He didn't seem to care about money other than to use it to create inventions for humanity. People still think of Marconi as the father of radio yet it was also Tesla's.<br /><br />You will enjoy this book and more importantly you may begin to recognize flashes of genius in yourself.
B006N0YWGY|4.0|this game makes me laugh as i try to navigate through the waters. after some practice and more understanding of the game i can do pretty good.
B00ACBN9CI|4.0|This is an awesome game in desperate need of a multiplayer component.  The only way games like this become support popular is when they do.  Look at Dogfight.  This is a better game mechanically, if they added multiplayer I'd play this over dogfight any day.  As it is, this game is picked wherever I don't have Wi-Fi.  Make it clear, I'm in the top 1 percent of players, so I play a lot, but I'd play a lot more.  I currently have almost all airplanes.  The f-22 is my favorite, but the mig fulcrum is pretty sweet.
B000069CWE|5.0|I love this album. It offers a lot more to the table than Hybrid Theory did and brings a lot of complex and powerful melodies to a lot of the songs that sounded like a bunch of guitars and drums in Hybrid Theory. The very last track, &#34;Krwling&#34; is especially powerful and musical.<br /><br />I find myself listening to this over and over again and it really is a neccesary addition to your music collection if you like Linkin Park.
B008QYT7DI|5.0|The meaning of this story happens sometime after the words are gone.  You will see inside by looking inside, where you cannot see.
B0030B621W|4.0|Don't watch the trailer! It's kind of a spoiler... kind of. That said, this is a smart movie, which I would have liked even more if I had not seen the trailer. If you like bang bang laser type sci fi flicks this is probably not for you. It is a good story, about personal feelings and what it means to be human. The main plot -the essence of the story- has been explored a lot in Sci Fi, but nonetheless it captures you. There is a freshness to it, mainly because of the acting, in my opinion. Definitely worth watching, if you don't mind reflecting a bit upon your life.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Tips: Don't sell your prizes!  They are worth more when you get a collection.  Stack the coins! This game takes into account the weight of the items. If  your coins are single layer, they will not push larger objects as well as if they are stacked 3 or 4 high.  Also, you get a bigger bang when coins dump when they are stacked.  Finally, you can have some control over the path of objects.  If, for example, the game drops a larger prize coin close to the left side,  drop a single coin behind it against the wall. The smaller coin will push the larger coin towards the center. Good luck!
B004SBS8LA|2.0|Angry Birds Rio is the worst Angry Birds theme they have created. Not just because it's challenging, but just weird, complicating, and misunderstanding.
1610390938|5.0|great introduction to the topic, keeps your attention throughout, easy to read, drives home many important points. also presents many different arguments and offers some thoughts on them, presents arguments from the books of other prominent scholars (Sachs, Easterly, Acemoglu, etc.)<br /><br />I would strongly recommend this book to anyone looking to learn more about fighting poverty in general, because even though it addresses global poverty, the arguments made are applicable in general (if you are looking to fight poverty on a much smaller scale, in your neighborhood for example). It establishes a good basis for thinking about the problem. It explains the importance of good policymaking.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I have been looking for a calender app for my Kindle Fire that would sync w/ Google calendar....and CalenGoo fit the bill perfectly.  Easy to use and usefull views.....daily, weekly and monthly!
B009AY04A8|4.0|This game is fun.  Has a decent story line, and the searching is a good way to pass the time.  Not difficult at all but enough to curb boredom. It's easy to lose track of time while playing.  And my 6 year old daughter really loves playing it with me.
1416955070|5.0|You can compare these books to Harry Potter all you want but they are a different series.  I don't care if they are like those books.  I have read the HP series like a million times and I need something else.  These are really fun to read and make me stay up late reading them.  To me, that's a good book.  I am not in high school yet so I don't have to read really serious books.  But, I am a teenage boy, so I really would rather read something with some adventure. I like these books.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Best free app game for all ages. This game is very easy to play and you become an quickly addicted.

B008NR8YXC|5.0|András Schiff recorded most of Bach's keyboard works in the 1980s, and has recently made a number of new recordings for ECM. This box set of the two books of the Well-Tempered Clavier is his latest such release, and shows Schiff as a much more mature pianist. Making a point of using the pedal as little as possible, Schiff delineates all the contrapuntal lines in the fugues carefully, and plays the preludes with zest and brio. In some ways, Schiff plays a Gouldian style here; hardly any legato, and a very percussive style.<br /><br />But Schiff doesn't fall into Gould's excesses, presenting each prelude and fugue as a carefully polished gem. Not using the sustaining pedal helps give this impression of separation between notes - as one hears more on a harpsichord - which highlights the rhythms of the pieces. His ornamentation is subtle and limited, but one gets the feeling that it is just right.<br /><br />Over time, listening through these four discs, I found that Schiff's style - which at first seemed just a bit jarring - made more and more sense. The music here can be lively or pensive, and Schiff takes all of its moods and provides an approach that stands on its own. Comparing it with pianists who use the pedal show a very large difference, but comparing it with harpsichord recordings offers more similarities than differences, in spite of the very different sounds of the instruments.<br /><br />The recording is excellent; the piano sounds rich and full, with no reverb to mar the details, or to drown out the subtleties of the counterpoint.<br /><br />This is a fine recording of Bach's great preludes and fugues, one that even those hesitant to listen to the work on modern piano should seek out.

B000FQJAIW|5.0|It was the original theatre release and the 2004 versions that were re-edited. It's hard to find the original so I'm glad I bought it.

069111966X|5.0|I first read this book in 1957, as I entered the 11th Grade. Except for 10th grade Geometry, mathematical problem solving up to that point had been a mixture of about 90% operational manipulation, and about 10% solving the much feared &#34;word problems,&#34; the ones that actually required thinking, planning and discovery, rather than just rote operational manipulation of formula.<br /><br />This was the first book to really open my eyes to what mathematics was really about; and I used the techniques in it over the summer before entering college as a way of reviewing all of the difficult problems in my high school math books, beginning with 9th and 10th grade Algebra, going on to 10th grade Geometry and ending up with the problems in 12th grade Trigonometry.<br /><br />That review, and the ease with which I could then solve the same problems that once gave me a fit when first encountered, and the confidence derived from being able to do so, even if it was very much after the fact, undoubtedly is the reason I finally decided to major in mathematics instead of music.<br /><br />Other than teachers like my Physics teacher Mr. E. E. Bankston, nothing in my educational career played a more decisive role in raising my awareness about, and confidence in my ability to solve mathematical problems, than Professor Polya's fabulous book. Every school, and especially every black school should use this book as its introduction to what mathematical problem solving is all about. There are few books that are as clear and yet as entertaining as this one. Five stars.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|This movie is a wonderful adaptation of Jane Austen's Pride and Predjudice.  The story has a twist unlike any other adaptation of Pride and Predjudice that I have seen.
B009ZQJ1G4|3.0|I'm surprised by the 5-star reviews.  Really, is this movie among the best you've ever seen?<br /><br />I thought the fight scenes came off kind of silly; they seemed vaguely reminiscent of The Matrix but -- well, corny by comparison.  Even the premise, that government had managed to make emotions illegal and would hunt down anyone who got off the drug that makes you an emotional zombie -- it was a bit far-fetched.<br /><br />There were parts that were somewhat intriguing, so it wasn't a total loss, but this movie is nothing to write home about.
B004SIP9U6|5.0|This movie is kind of like Romeo and Juliet, but the main characters don't die in the end.  A wonderful romantic movie.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Very true to the book with both plot and characters.  Most movies adapted from books are a disappointment, but not this one.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's so fluffy! A lot of fun and very great way to kill some time.  Very similar to the classic run games
0307950654|3.0|Too tame -  not as complex as her Dalglesh series which I love.  I like the traditional and complicated English mysteries better
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|It's in color...  It has sound and actors.  There is a yellow car, a couple mansions and some yahts.  There aren't any monkeys but I think monkeys would have made the movie better - and a scene from aliens where the alien comes out of the dude's chest.  That would have lifted the mood somewhat at the end.
B0058OUJA4|5.0|This game is extremely addictive. Its very easy to learn and once you start playing is very hard to stop. Easy controls and great visuals. 5/5

B00DHNB5CY|2.0|I didn't expect a exact remake of the original. But I wanted something more than the gore factor cranked up. The genre seems to be dead as everything is just boring recycled crap. In that manner this didn't disappoint.

B0015AARJI|5.0|Exactly what i need , and paid for.<br />The only negative, is that this product do not come with the USB charger cable, but its ok, its not so expensive to buy in a separate way.
0307010856|5.0|I bought this for my two year old daughter because I had this book as a child.  I love the playfulness of the story and how silly I can be reading it with her.<br /><br />She is a big Sesame Street fan, and this book adds to her Little Golden Book collection.
B008S4FZHI|1.0|This book was AWFUL!!! To be honest I have only read the last 7/8 Scarpettas out of loyalty....the first ones were fantastic..postmortem, cruel and unusual etc...she has written nothing like this in a long time.<br />Anyways back to this book...it is so so bad. It's the usual secenario...Benton is being quiet, Scarpetta is paranoid, Lucy is secretive and Marino is annoying her...same as her last few books but you know they will all end up eating pasta in Scarpetta's house at the end. The boat scene went on forever and was soooo dull. Without giving the (dull) story away, the issues with Benton at the start just seem to disappear halfway thro the book...they had absolutely nothing to do with the overall story. Why was this included? Marino is made out to be a complete idiot...what happened to the brilliant detective in her earlier novels? It was terrible and definitely my last scarpetta!
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|I begin to play this game and loved it. But then I shut my Kindle off and it would not work. After 3 weeks it begin to work again.
B005JOC8EI|5.0|Great addition to a movie collection. Already knew I loved the movies because I had already watched them before but having the combo set of DVDs comes in handy when you want a movie night marathon.

B00004T9AF|5.0|Among instrumental LP's, This album has practically attained a FOLKLORE status. It will likely be viewed historically way down the road the way works of classic composers are thought of today.<br /><br />First off this is NOT (as some think) a soundtrack album. Mike Oldfield began this idea at 17 and completed it at 19. The theme's use in The Exorcist was an afterthought.<br /><br />So what we have is a very intricate complex two part 50 minute composition which would likely appeal to fans of progressive rock, classical music, and to some degree jazz and Avant-garde music. Mike plays most of it himself. The rear cover has a rather impressive list showing something like 15 or so instruments which he plays on the piece (The list is actually somewhat longer, but there are duplications and similar instruments (IE Spanish & Acoustic Guitar)).<br /><br />A simple break down of the Music:<br /><br />Part one (Side 1 of LP) goes through many changes which somehow seem to flow together nicely before melding into a passage in which various instruments are introduced (literally) building to up the \\"Tubular Bells\\" climax. (25:00 min)<br /><br />Part Two (Side 2 of LP) has several longer passages each building in it's own way the last of which contains some of the most beautiful guitar (backed with organ) committed to vinyl. This is capped off with a twist, the now famous Sailor's Hornpipe repeated faster and faster. (23:50 min)<br /><br />Although Tubular Bells is quite an artistic work, parts like the instrument introductions, Piltdown Man and Sailor's Hornpipe add an interesting lightness overall.<br /><br />There are many versions of Tubular Bells: Original, Boxed remix, Quad, Orchestral, Live, 2003 re-recording original demos and 5.1 included in the 2003 DVD and the new remix included in the Mercury set and there's probably more. Off hand, I can't think of another non-classical work which has more versions. I'd still give the original top honers with the 2003 version a relatively close second.<br /><br />Probably the thing to do if you've never heard the complete work would be to listen to the original first.<br /><br />If you get roped in and want more, Deluxe Mercury version would be the one to get. It includes the original, the recent (2009) remix and a 5.1 mix DVD. For still more The Tubular bells 2003 DVD audio includes the original early demos and a 5.1 mix of the 2003 re-recording.<br /><br />Now there's a chance for Progressive rock lovers to indulge!!!tively close second.<br /><br />Probably the thing to do if you've never heard the complete work would be to listen to the original first.<br /><br />If you get roped in and want more, Deluxe Mercury version would be the one to get.

B00AATFJK2|4.0|You have to love this combination of satire and terror.  First-time director Michael Crichton has crafted a wildly entertaining piece that muses on artificial intelligence and a decaying culture.  Taking a page from \\"2001:  A Space Odyssey\\" (1968) and \\"THX 1138\\" (1971), this sci-fi/horror hybrid incorporates music and organic noises to punctuate almost every scene.  The sound of computers humming, footsteps echoing and heavy breathing become just as much a part of the soundtrack as the upbeat country music.  Actor Richard Benjamin wisely plays the unlikely hero (or unfortunate victim, depending on one's point of view) with a pinch of nerdiness and naïvet&eacute;.  However, it is actor Yul Brynner who truly elevates this feature with his imposing presence.  His gun toting android is relentless and his icy gaze is spine-chilling.  Also, it is worth noting that this film was produced during the malaise era of cinema from the mid-1960's to the late 1970's.  One has to admit that this work has held up nicely over the years considering the low budgets of its day.  Finally, \\"Westworld\\" is a balanced mix of social commentary and unnerving tension that remains endlessly fascinating.  {Solid blu-ray, by the way.  This title is good for those who love to give their sound systems a workout.  Unfortunately, too many home video fans think good audio is simply big explosions, car chases and gunfire.  Keep in mind that it can also be a beautiful score, conversations in a diner and animal noises in a jungle.  The point is great audio should have variety, not just clarity on booming sounds.}
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I used to enjoy being able to pull out my phone and read if I had a few minutes here and there.  But with the new &#34;improvement&#34; of the app trying to calculate how much reading time is left for each chapter every time I turn a page, I can't!  My time has increased exponentially, because my phone freezes while it figures it out.  And that's after it now takes forever to load.  If there's some way to turn this off, I can't find it.  I tried settings, but they're very basic and do not include this feature.  Seriously, this makes me reconsider lugging around physical books.  Easy to find my place, load, and turn the page!!!
B005DI994W|5.0|This adaptation of the well-known 1902 novel is lavish and brilliant.  The plot?  A lieutenant accused of cowardice becomes a spy for his country in order to redeem himself.  What a classic tale!  Director Zoltan Korda has created an intimate story with a savage war raging in the forefront.  Not an easy thing to accomplish.  It would have been easier to keep the protagonist just on the edge of the brutal conflict.  However, history informs us that greatness is not achieved by being timid.  Credit this brave approach to the trio of screenwriters - R.C. Sherriff, Lajos Biro and Arthur Wimperis.  Also, praise must go to convincing performances from John Clements, C. Aubrey Smith and Ralph Richardson.  Without a doubt, \\"The Four Feathers\\" is a grand heroic adventure boxed in a timeless package.  {Thank heavens for the Criterion Collection, which did a splendid job restoring this 1939 British production and releasing it on blu-ray.}
B00DW39B2K|5.0|Deniro andTravolta are superb!  Once you start watching you can't stop. The movie really got us wondering about those who have served and those who still do. Our hearts go out to all who have sacrificed for freedom.
B00DHHWXYY|2.0|Despite the filmmakers' efforts to adapt the well-known novel into a palatable movie for 2013, \\"The Great Gatsby\\" serves as a cautionary tale for anyone bent on changing the source material.  Sometimes things are best left alone.  Director Baz Luhrmann unwisely plays up a romantic angle.  This miscalculation dooms what could have been a stylish update of a popular book.  What's the real story?  Gatsby is a man who believes that he can buy the American Dream (and pretty much anything else he desires).  Instead of this picture taking the time to get know its central figure and depict his inevitable fall, the script puts a `Romeo and Juliet'-type spin on his story.  This misses the whole point of the novel.  Also, Daisy isn't supposed to be a likable character, but this fact didn't stop the producers from trying to make her so.  What all this boils down to is one should never adapt a story if they intend to dramatically change the characters motivations.  When motives and intentions are altered, the original structure ceases to exist.  The end result of this adaptation is an empty work brought down by its pointless misdirections and unfulfilling ambitions.
0760335540|5.0|If all you ever do is clean your car, top up the oil and change the occasional light bulbs, it will be well worth buying this book.<br /><br />If you plan on doing anything more adventurous you'd be an idiot not to buy it.<br /><br />The author is clearly very knowledgeable AND he can write well.<br /><br />Even if you don't plan to ever work on your car, it's great to be able to learn more about the car and be in a better position to understand what needs to be done and not be railroaded by the garage.
B008B3MZNI|4.0|To long-time fans, this video release is like finding treasure in one's attic.  After all these years, Supertramp has taken this film shot at the peak of their success out of their archives, restored it and then released it to music lovers - young and old.  The audio is excellent, while the video quality is merely solid.  Darkly lit moments show age deterioration with noticeable white specks.  This is most evident on the opening number, \\"School.\\"  Nevertheless, the overall product is more than satisfactory.  Nowadays, there is the temptation to overuse digital scrubbing software to clean up old film.  Here is a case where all involved resisted that temptation as there is very little digital scrubbing on this disc.  Now then, viewers will marvel at the band's multi-instrument prowess, smile at ringmaster John Helliwell's rapport with the audience and applaud the epic jams on \\"Another Man's Woman,\\" \\"Rudy\\" and \\"Child Of Vision.\\"  It would have been nice for this footage to have included more shots of bassist Dougie Thomson and drummer Bob Siebenberg, but that's a minor complaint.  In the end, \\"Live In Paris\\" captures a great band in their prime playing hits such as \\"Goodbye Stranger,\\" \\"The Logical Song,\\" \\"Bloody Well Right\\" and \\"Give A Little Bit.\\"  For anyone who appreciates mature rock and roll, this is a concert not to be missed.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Great read.  Very interesting story.  Mixes a modern story with a compelling story from the past yet blends them both nicely.
B00A8MGLAI|2.0|Probably somewhere amongst the six interwoven tales was one story worthy of its own picture.  My vote would be for the Neo Seoul, Korea, 2144 section.  But next time, cast Asian actors for Asian parts.  There are times when CGI is totally inappropriate.  Turning Caucasian men into Koreans with FX is off-putting, frankly.  Now then, the D.W. Griffith classic \\"Intolerance\\" (1916) also intercuts between multiple stories - four to be exact.  That masterpiece focused on tales that shared a common theme, but it also established the men and women that inhabited the worlds of each section.  In contrast, \\"Cloud Atlas\\" fails to do either of those things.  The viewer is plunged awkwardly into the different eras with little set up or context.  Sometimes I wish filmmakers would just keep it simple.  Alas, I cannot recommend this ambitious, but flawed experiment.
B00CBRH4YU|2.0|The title of the review sums it up:  This film has beautiful - at times - cinematography; some of the interactions and music is haunting; the story is BORING; and the entire film itself seems pointless.  Now, I enjoy indie films with \\"philosophical\\" \\"existential\\" musing, but this is NOT that.  It is banal and lame.
B00C7JFIRC|3.0|I'll skip the expected comparisons between this new film and the classic 1939 musical.  The greatness of \\"The Wizard Of Oz\\" casts a tall shadow over anyone that attempts to make a movie based on the popular L. Frank Baum books.  That said, director Sam Raimi has largely succeeded in turning an old, yet familiar, world into something relevant.  I'll be the first to say \\"Oz, The Great And Powerful\\" is a disjointed blockbuster; but doggone it, this picture acquits itself with a satisfying conclusion.  Actors Mila Kunis and Michelle Williams are out of place in the fantasy genre regrettably, while Rachel Weisz nails her part.  Overall, this is a great-looking film that works in the right places despite its warts.<br />  COMMENTS:  { SPOILER ALERT }  As Mila Kunis's character, Theodora, slips into darkness and jeolousy, one sees that her tears burn her face.  Not to be a complete wise guy here, but if the Wicked Witch melts when water is thrown on her, how does she take a bath?  Also, how dumb is Theodora anyway?  It is obvious that her sister, Evanora, spied on her using a crystal ball.  Wouldn't that make one suspicious?  I mean, couldn't the naïve young sister ask one question before willingly eating a magic apple that disfigures her appearance?  Also, poor Kunis sounded like a bratty ten-year-old every time she raised her voice.  That was distracting.

0767847431|2.0|Believe it or not, this movie was produced for just under one-million dollars in the malaise era of cinema from the mid-1960's to the late 1970's.  Such a price tag was low even then.  Alas, too often the constraints of a tight budget show up onscreen.  Aside from the battle where the heroes duel a six-armed Kali idol, there is little to praise here.  Actor John Phillip Law looks the part as Sinbad, but the anemic script gives him nothing to work with.  Sadly, even the aging charms of Ray Harryhausen's FX work cannot save this listless affair.

B0019NB9A2|5.0|A tremendous science fiction film!  By the way, its influence can be clearly seen on the television shows \\"Star Trek\\" (1966-1969) and \\"Lost In Space\\" (1965-1968).  The plot?  A rescue mission on a distant planet turns dangerous when a mysterious being attacks an entire flight crew.  Take note - there is plenty to praise here.  First, director Fred McLeod Wilcox is able to balance the cerebral themes with occasional humor and old fashioned romance, so that the movie remains above all else entertaining.  Second, this production makes terrific use of matte paintings and a large cyclorama to illustrate the planet landscape of Altair IV.  A similar technique was used in Stanley Kubrick's \\"2001:  A Space Odyssey\\" (1968) to great effect.  Lastly, how about that trailblazing soundtrack?  The composing couple of Louis and Bebe Barron brought forth here the first electronic music score to a mainstream film.  Who would have thought to build electronic circuits to make strange noises?  Their music was groundbreaking and innovative.  The eerie sounds have such character and give this flick a unique personality.  All that said, \\"Forbidden Planet\\" is a smart mystery that excels in adventure and wonder.  {It is also the complete package on blu-ray with handsome video, amazing audio and a plethora of extra features, which includes the outstanding documentary called \\"Watch The Skies! Science Fiction, The 1950's And Us.\\"  No doubt, a blu-ray fan gets their money's worth here.}

But this one seemed as if I had already read it or read something very similar (it seems as if Downtown Abbey may be based on this book or maybe some other book that I read earlier). You kind of know how it is going to end from the get go, there are no surprises there. But it is a good summer read.

0307950689|1.0|One thing that I have always enjoyed about Dan Brown's books is that they are relateable  to those of us unfortunate to visit or know of the places that he writes about. DaVinci Code I could easily relate to as I am familiar with most of the artwork involved, plus the places that the story takes place. The coffee table book, with accompanying copies of the artwork being referenced was one of the best books I have ever purchased!<br /><br />Lost Symbol, on the other hand, takes place in an area of the world that I have NO mental recollection of, I'm not familiar with the area, and the way the book is written, it seems as though you need to be a resident of the area or have visited it in order to understand everything that is going on. I was totally lost trying to read the book. This is the FIRST Dan Brown book that I found easy to put down, unlike others which kept me up all night with the thought of I'll read just one more page, chapter, etc..  Lost Symbol, after a paragraph or two I was ready to put the book down.<br /><br />It seems to me that Dan Brown phoned this book in, without having too many eyes looking at it before it was published, otherwise, it would have made more sense!<br /><br />Save your money on this one! If you REALLY want it, then just wait until it's on sale for a penny as used, then you won't be out the overpriced publishers list and Amazon's bulk price!<br /><br />What a waste of my money!<br /><br />Come on Dan Brown! You've made plenty of money already, SHOULD you write another book, take the time to make sure that your readers will understand what's going on and where, otherwise, your run as a \\"best selling author\\" will probably come to an end. All I know is that your next release will NOT be pre-ordered by me, nor will I pay Amazon's price, I'll wait until someone wants to sell their used copy and I won't feel ripped off!

B000FQITXE|5.0|Vivaldi's concerti for mandolin have been constants in my life since high school when my father purchased an introductory set for a buck from the now-defunct but once glorious Musical Heritage Society, didn't care for it and passed it on to me.  It was the Claudio Scimone/I Solisti Veneti set and I immediately fell in love with it.  This majestic, brilliant music has been with me through many editions (LP, cassette, CD versions) for over 50 years.  It was one of the first CDs I purchased when a digital version became available (the Scimone set in 1984, reviewed below.)<br /><br />Vivaldi's concerti for mandolin and lute are among the glories of his output and of the Baroque in general.  With many versions available with various selections and so many interpretive approaches it's not an easy choice deciding which recording(s) to go with.  Although there are many available on disk here are some observations on a select few.<br /><br />Il Giardino Armonico with Giovanni Antonini<br />RV 558, 540 425, 85, 93, 82, 532<br />Playing so precise and crisp it fairly crackles.  Every note has been considered.  Sharp, on the mark attacks with a thrilling edge.  Every instrument is in perfect balance.  In many ways the best of the bunch if not as lyrical in the slow movements as the John Williams or Claudio Scimone sets.  This is muscular, no-holds-barred Vivaldi that scales the heights.  The slow movements bristle with a lyrically masculine sensitivity.  Every concerto is beautifully realized and the recording is first rate.  The playing overall is a revelation - many moments are breathtaking in their precision and crispness.  A set that never fails to enrapture time after time.  All that plus that fact that it's available in a bargain box set of 11 CDs which serves as a terrific overall introduction to the music of the Baroque.  A recording for those who like their Vivaldi straight.  Rock-solid musicianship in the service of music these performers both understand and truly appreciate.  Worth every one of the 5 stars and then some.<br /><br />Europa Galante with Fabio Biondi<br />RV 532, 558, 576, 564, 319, 425, 555<br />My least favorite of the group, an idiosyncratic performance I simply don't care for, try as I might.  One problem is that the balance seems off, especially when compared to the other sets.  The organ accompaniment competes with the mandolin in one of the concertos. Other instruments in other places do the same thing and I find it distracting.  Some of the tempi also seem off.  What I think of as the lyrical swell of these pieces is missing.  I've wanted to like this and other Vivaldi recordings by this ensemble but haven't been able to warm to them the way I have with others.  The few times I've listened to it I am reminded how well any given concert sounds in any of the other versions.  It's well played and recorded but I would pass on this one.  This group has garnered a lot of praise for their live performances and I heartily agree with their aim of promoting an Italian period instrument ensemble, but the recordings strike me as too fussy and overdone. Four stars.<br /><br />I Solisti Veneti with Claudio Scimone<br />RV 532, 425, 558, 93<br />Readers should know that is one little problem here:  during recording the sound of passing traffic (sounds like a truck) was picked up.  It's faint and only in one movement (the quiet middle movement of RV 532 - more misfortune) but once heard it detracts somewhat from the lyrical beauty of the movement.  Overall, however, the playing and the recording is superb.  The performances are terrific - well-balanced with the mandolin at the forefront and solidly supported.  In many respects, this is the most translucent of all with respect to the slow movements which are the aural equivalent of cut crystal - delicate and luminous.  The middle movement of RV 558 is a particular wonder.  A subdued mandolin provides accents against the soaring, wistful melody carried in the strings - pureItalian Baroque romanticism.  Exquisitely bittersweet and suffused with melancholic recollections of love lost yet enduring still.  A real shame that the recording has the slight defect mentioned above, however brief. But if you are searching for a set of concertos beautifully played - lyrical and dynamic at the same time this is well worth considering.  Should be in every classical music library.  5 stars.<br /><br />John Williams with the Franz Liszt Chamber Orchestra, Janos Rolla conductor<br />RV 230, 356, 82, 540, 93<br />This set, performed on guitar and not mandolin, is a real charmer.  With the added bonus of two violin concerti transcribed for guitar (the credits list Williams as the transcriber) it's a can't miss compilation. This is Vivaldi for a rainy day, quiet, reflective, a bit wistful and at peace with the world.  The guitar (as opposed to mandolin) lends a warmer texture to the music, rounder, freer, more liquid, like a clear mountain stream. The performance is restrained but lively with Williams perfectly set against the accompaniment - each does full justice to the other.  The guitar playing is absolutely perfect - never showy and always in the service of the music.  This is Vivaldi in the grand manner, performed with exquisite exuberance and suffused with majestic grandeur in a regal, courtly style.  5 stars.<br /><br />To summarize I would recommend getting everything here with the exception of the Europa Galante set.  That way you'll have the \\"greatest hits\\" of these recordings by exceptional artists with a few extras here and there as well.Italian Baroque romanticism.

B004W1GCNC|2.0|The central theme of this season is lost because the characters are not likable as a whole, and there is too much discord in the story and in the characters themselves.  The people seem brittle and the actions are often abrupt.  I find it difficult to sympathize with the people in the series.  In short, I do not plan to watch it this fall if it is on.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I do not know how much of this is documentary or how much is fiction, but it explains how government comes and goes. And it also how the ruling class views itself above any law. Sad as it is , the rise and fall of those in power never seems to fall on those who rise and fall unless those that fall from power are totally wiped out! A lot of explaining WWI, is real. I'd like to see more of what made WWII unfold as it did. Today we are seeing a lot of the same old crap being rehashed with the same type of leadership.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The characters and story are believable.  Perhaps the best of all is that the characters are real and l can identify with each one (sometimes painfully) in one way or another.  When we have watched one episode we can hardly wait for the next one because the actors/actresses draw us into their lives.  I especially appreciate the underlying moral tone of the series which stands out in contrast to other 'stuff' on TV.  There is some violence and sex, but they fit the story and lives of the characters without being overdone.  We also like the smooth flow of the episodes and of the series as a whole, because it is historically based and takes us along on its journey with the characters and situations.  This is a great series, and perhaps the best we have ever watched.  Keep up the good work and keep Downton Abbey coming.

B00DW39B2K|1.0|Good News first. This movie has two above average aspects; cinematography, and Robert DiNero. Camerawork does a fine job of taking you into the Black Forrest, and making you feel like you are there. DiNero is the textbook example of how to act, no matter what the script. Very beliveable character, and as an old soldier, I saw myself in him at times, especially with the personality \\"quirks\\". This is what the star is for. End of good news.<br /><br />Bad News. While I could go on and on, I will spare you. Just the high points. First and foremost, I don't know who the director was yet, but will make a point to NEVER again contribute to his livelyhood. While I do not believe in censorship, and Art is just that; fiction, one must own a certain ethic when producing media that could represent truth to the easily impressionable and ignorant. The US never has, nor ever will, execute prisoners on the battlefield. Nazis and Taliban; yes. American uniformed forces, NO! The movie opens like a documentary with statistics and historical reference, then shows captured Serbs being shot in the head while kneeling and bound, by US Army personnel. While many will not understand the difference, it is what allows us to hold the slightest shred of decency as soldiers, even when our politicians may be idiots all. Sure, acts of atrocity are commited by uniformed soldiers, but not as a matter of doctrine, rather individual acts of treason. Soldiers should not kill non-combatants, and bound prisoners are just that. Why DiNero would choose this script is puzzling, but is evidence of the statement this movie makes about how bankrupt Hollywood creativity is at the moment. There are no good scripts, or he would not have taken this DOG.<br /><br />Lastly, speaking of DOGs, I have not enjoyed Travolta since Pulp Fiction, where he was a perfect fit for his role. While it was pretty fun seeing him get stabbed in the leg in Savages, his current market value is also puzzling. Insofar as a Serbian national , his head is way too big, both figuratively and literally. Did not convince for one second that the accent was genuine, nor the resentment that fueled the character's vengence. All the fury of a Manatee, with a comical facial hair patch. That should have been the biggest red flag.<br /><br />This is one I wish I could unsee, as the statement made is how both Hollywood, and the Military Bashing Media that so influences them ( or is it the other way around? ) have nothing to offer. I want my time back, you can keep my money as a fine on me.

His older music is the best this cd a high schooler can have better music this. Wiz sing like you use to, out of the whole cd I only like two ad it a shame I wish I had broght the single

B009YN2M7S|5.0|Once again Nicholas sparks creates a spectacular novel based on love. As all Nicholas sparks books there's a traffic background to the main characters, two people fall in love, there's a near death experience and a great finale with an unexpected twist in the story.
B0027J4SKA|5.0|This is a spectacular album. Melody Gardot doesn't make typical jazz. She spices it up with different tempos and rhythms. Gardot moves between slow despairing tones and chirpy ballads. Hearing the orchestral version of &#34;If the Stars Were Mine&#34; is wonderful.
B00DWZHTRW|2.0|Seems like this one is all sizzle, no steak.  Aside from a really cool fight scene in which a cop fights a magician who's using parlor tricks, this one failed to impress me.  The ending features a nonsensical twist - which I'm sure you knew would happen, based on the fact that it's about sleight of hand.<br /><br />The real magic here is trying to figure out how this made 100 million dollars at the box office.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have this on my Ipad as well as my kindle. Not too much to comment on, it is simple, clean looking, and so far no software issues
0321356683|5.0|I've learned many of the lessons in this book--or, as one of my colleagues likes to say, developed scar tissue--through trial and error, but I would have saved myself from a lot of mistakes had I read this book from the start.  Josh Bloch gives dozens of practical explanations for why or why not to do various things a certain way, and under what conditions it may be acceptable to stray from his guidelines.  I read about halfway through the first edition before deciding that I really needed to read the second edition, which covers newer features such as generics.  Whether you're a seasoned Java developer or a beginner, or whether or not you've read the first edition already, Joshua Bloch's Effective Java (2nd Edition) is definitely worth a read--and while you're at it, pick up a copy of Java Puzzlers, too.
0896898288|5.0|I really liked how everything was put together. If you go to Marti Michelle's website sign up for using her templates with these patterns. I agree with a few others that it would be nice to have the patters print more then one on each page. Anyone quilt who knows how to do sashing and squares should know how to do this with ease. There are finishing instructions in the book - just look for them in the back of the book. Great job and I can't wait entill her next book! I have my blocks done and will be putting them together. I did mine in reproduction fabrics and love it.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This action packed fantasy is a truly engrossing adventure with seemingly endless twists and turns.  At the end of this second book, we are left with as many questions as our protagonist and in a dark, though highly imaginative place. Hopefully, Day 3 will be available soon to provide the needed answers. An excellent, creative read,indeed.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This is a very easy to use device.  Can only really use for Netflix or youtube right now.  But hopes are that in the future will be able to stream all content from my phone or tablet to the TV. Don't waste your money on a Smart TV.  This device basically can do the same thing.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fab fun but so brain frustrating!!! Makes you think and use your memory ,good graphics clear what you should be able to see but challenging to find what's hidden!!
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|The storyline, acting, pace and editing of this series were utterly amazing. After hearing so many positive things about the House of Cards from friends and family members, we decided to take the plunge and purchase the complete first season and wow, we were not disappointed. Kevin Spacey's depiction of Congressman Francis Underwood acting was so (unfortunately) believable -- a truly ruthless, power hungry and scheming politician. Robin Wright in her own right scored high marks with us. Her cool, almost detached demeanor in her business life and personal life complimented her relationship and goals of her husband, the Congressman. And, Kate Mara's character as a reporter was as ruthless as Underwood's. Both of them had only one goal, which was to further their careers! House of Cards has got to be the finest &#34;political&#34; type series or movie we have ever watched! By comparison, other films have a dream-like quality to them, which we surmise is how Americans want (or would like) their politicians to behave. In any event, we can't wait for Season 2 to present itself, and we will most definitely will purchase it from Amazon.com, our go-to primary site!
B004SDEP38|1.0|Waste of my time. You can't really do anything with this app unless you buy the upgrade.  I deleted it from my devise.
B00BQ1D7BQ|5.0|There are no ifs, ands or buts about this disc, this continues the trajectory Stills has been on since 2005's Man Alive. That disc signaled Stills had recovered his voice, his creativity as a guitar player and his prowess as a songwriter. Live at Shepherd's Bush documented a man in full control of all of his amazing powers. Add to that this intrepid blues/rock work out and you have a man not just playing to his strengths but enhancing them.<br />Lord knows what all the backstage dramas are involved with getting a beast like CSN or worse, CSNY, out of its cave, and there were horrific rumours of them doing a covers album (no one needs Stills or Crosby wimping out a la Peter Gabriel, and Croz is about to cut loose again anyway), but at some point, Stills must have decided he owed it to himself first to see what was in the tank.<br />There's plenty. He sounds great, he plays even better than he has of late. Jerry Harrison has done a terrific job on the production. And in Kenny Wayne Shephard, Barry Goldberg on keys and the former SRV rhythm section of Chris Layton on drums and Tommy Shannon on bass, this is a band on fire, tapping the source and not letting it go. Because he isn't trying to be all things that Stills can be to all people, but has focused his energy in a direction in which he excels, Stills is simply a master at the top of his game. There isn't a weak track on the record. Shepherd is a brilliant partner to Stills, as is Goldberg and the rest of the band, but The Rides got them one driver and he has let this engine roar. There are a number of covers that are among the best renditions of the songs ever, notably Honey Bee, Rockin in the Free World (Young should only ever allow Emmylou Harris and Stills to cover him as they do a better job with his tunes than Young does), and a little number called That's a Pretty Good Love, based on a melody without words by that 19th Century European boogie-woogie master Fred Mendelsohn (used to know a Chinese pianist wotcould squeeze the funk out of those tunes). The collaborative originals are brilliant and Stills and colleagues reconsider his Word Game to impressive effect. A timely tune that, with all this Republican obstructionism clogging the arteries of America.<br />Can't get Enough? Not by half. Keep it coming, Stephen. Man alive, this and Buddy Guy's Rhythm and Blues are about as good as real music is gonna get this year.

B003VANOFY|3.0|Win 7 64-bit & Logitech Drivers:<br />- Switching between the Logitech driver audio headset & Realtek soundcard (onboard mobo) was a pain, it'd freeze the volume controls and basically render sound useless.  If you are going to use SOLELY the Logitech device, go with it.  If you plan on switching between speakers and this, good luck.<br />- The surround sound is pretty awesome<br /><br />Win 7 64-bit & Microsoft drivers:<br />- switching between Logitech device and Realtek sound card is a breeze.  You lose the surround sound, but it works!<br /><br />I bought these b/c I was tired of rolling over my headset cable.  I can deal with MS stereo drivers instead of true surround sound such that I can go headset or speakers without freezing my machine.<br /><br />I have used theses on Windows 8 64-bit with MS Drivers only, I'm scared to introduce the logitech drivers again, its such a pain to get them uninstalled and back to the MS Drivers.<br /><br />The range isn't that far, I cant go more than 1 room away (with walls) before it drops, but thats not my real goal anyway).<br /><br />Bottom line: If you can tolerate the MS Drivers and 'stereo sound' its a decent headset.

B0006GAOCW|5.0|Funny, heart warming, and I would amagine that is how many of the children would fill in growing up in the White House. I really enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to others. The shipment came fast and that is important to me.
B001N4OX82|5.0|We enjoyed the movie.  The only problem was that the movie would just stop and we'd have to restart it.  Once would have been alright, but we had to do this several times.
B003UGLCIA|4.0|When my wife and I got engaged in '74, we went to Florida to visit my parents who were living there at the time. My cousin took us to see this new film that was the hot ticket. It was 'The Exorcist.' The theater was packed and I never forget how the audience freaked out during the scary scenes. I've never seen crowds react so strong to a horror film since then. We haven't seen the film in at least ten years so last night we watched the DVD of the Director's Cut which has ten extra minutes footage.<br /><br />So how has the film aged? Is it as scary as before? The special effects aren't as sophisticated as today's CGI but the film still packs a wallop due to the clever editing. You're on an emotional roller coaster ride while the suspense ebbs and flows as the story gradually builds with each possession scene of increasing intensity until the final confrontation between good and evil. The extra footage has the originally deleted famous spider walk included and more doctor scenes and more of the detective at the end. There are no extras except for the Director's Commentary and a trailer unlike previous editions but I really can't complain for $5.<br /><br />The video shows a lot of grain when upscaled to 1080P but this probably due to the film stock of the time. I've read the Blu-ray version still has too much grain but the overall picture is better. Surround sound effects are minimal since the film was recorded in mono. There's a new Blu-ray coming out in October '13 so I'll wait to see if the grain situation has improved. Meanwhile I'll keep this one and wait for the reviews. Here's what the new edition features: [...]

B002L3RVCY|5.0|My sons are 8 and 9 and love Clone Wars.  The episodes are short - about 15 minutes, so they make a good break or cool down after playing outside. They have watched each disk several times and always enjoy it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|My granddaughter plays this and loves it, has even gotten me to trying it.  It really helps in keeping your memory skills together and logic thinking.
B004T4M5TM|5.0|Thought I have never had a real celebrity crush Tina Fey is a good starter crush as she seems neither pretentious or crazy. Her stories and insights are funny and touching and since I watched all of 30 Rock the book was like a behind the scenes guide. An easy read and fun for those who like nerds, democrats and a few lesbian friends stories.
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|This game is terrific. Its very simple to learn and has many levels. Why people game it a low rating.... I have no idea.
140006922X|5.0|This book did not shake my faith in my Lord Jesus Christ, but rather it gave me a new perspective of looking at the time my Lord lived in.<br />A wonderful story describing the politics of Israel and Jerusalem, the people, and the world in which they lived in during the time of Jesus from a historical perspective.<br />Although I may not agree with the author's spiritual musings in the book, I do marvel at his dedication to trying to describe Jesus, the man.<br />Some of the questions that confound the author, are easily answered by anyone of faith.<br />Such as, the author agrees that Jesus was a great healer and performed many miracles, but he can not understand why Jesus never charged for his healings, like the many other healers of the time???? But we Christians know why.<br />Or &#34;Why would a man go willingly to his death was he crazed?&#34; Or did this Jesus have a higher motive?<br />The author uncovers Jesus' most pronounced message, (The temple will fall, and I will  raise it in three days) yet he does not understand how it it comes out as truth in the gospel of Mark.<br />I.E. After the destruction of Israel and the temple by the Romans, A man named Mark begins to write a gospel because he sees the truth in Christ's message, that violence against the oppressor didn't work, that only love would  make a change. It is this new Christian message that three hundred years later the Oppressors (Romans) would adopt.
0316247545|4.0|The only issue I have about it is that they forgot (or neglected?) to put in the lyrics to the &#34;Evil Enchantress&#34; song, and considering that this is an &#34;Official Guidebook&#34; of the show, missing a detail like that equals a loss of one star. But other than that, its pretty cool to have for a fan to have.

0802473156|5.0|This book walks you through the 5 ways that we can feel loved.  Just because you're in a relationship doesn't mean that your love languages are the same.  Chapman describes in detail, the characteristics of each of the love languages.  One or two will resonate with each of us more than the rest. I really love to give this book to engaged couples or newlyweds.  It's a perfect time for them to read this together and really discuss what they need in terms of a loving partner.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I just downloaded this app to go with the alarm clock, looks good. I'm always wondering what the weather will bring, I hope it meets my expectations.<br />I'm rating it 5 stars based on what I've seen so far, I could change my mind in the future

0307476073|5.0|Cheryl Strayed exceeded my expectations for this book.  The description of her Pacific Crest Trail adventure was gripping and her life leading up to the hike was compelling as well.  A good read especially anyone with mother issues.
B001GCUO1Q|3.0|I love the comic book \\"wolverine origins\\" and they did incorporate the story a bit. I'd say it's an overall good movie until they changed Deadpool into some weird mutant. Whoever came up with that should be locked in the same room with the person that changed the storyline of the watchmen movie, total bomb.

B002EDH0FE|1.0|First I want to say the visuals are AMAZING in this movie and I love the cast and characters. The movie slides off the deep end when it comes to following the story from the graphic novel, watching the movie I knew something wasn't right. Then when the movie got to the climax I knew why nothing tied together, they changed the whole plot for Ozymandias. I can't even watch this movie and I don't understand how it gets so much love in the amazon reviews. If Zach Snyder did an adaptation of \\"romeo and juliet\\" neither of them would die at the end and they would walk off in the sunset happily ever after. Sorry.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|This is absolutely hilarious- but anything with Paul Rudd will be over the top with &#34;GD's&#34;- that gets old. Not trerribly gond of the daughter saying it either or F*&^ for that matter- but if you've been married & have children- it hits all the right problems! Very funny

B002VISNLC|5.0|My 7 year old son loved this book, he sat down and read it from cover to cover, torch under the blankets at night, what a classic and fun story that has not dated.
B000P0J0D8|5.0|One of the best! The confrontations between: Christian Slater vs. Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper vs. Chris Walken, Rosanna Arquette vs. James Gandolfini, are terrific. Don't miss this movie.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|A promising suspenseful start, engaging characters, southern twang done well.  Then, about halfway into the movie, you realize it's all about a fairly dull and formulaic \\"boy meets girl - boy loses girl - boy wants the girl back\\" story.  All the characters become black-and-white, and you sort of see the ending.  An average flick at best.
B0030P1WKY|5.0|JAN Spiller has literally changed the lives of my family and friends.  Her information is extremely accurate.  God bless her for every life she's healed thorough her AMAZING work.  She makes this world a better world.....<br />Ppl

B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved it. Was surprised by the ending. Also saw the movie and they were similar.Would recommend it to anyone who likes Nicholas Sparks books.
B006O6F932|5.0|Amazon found me one of these that was only $50, much cheaper than you will find ANYWHERE else. And it's definitely worth the buy!!<br /><br />It's very large and instead of the routine &#34;house&#34;, it is the school. With all the accessories + stuff, it's easy to assemble and lots of fun to play with.... altho I will say, the turn tables are a bit...forgettable.<br /><br />Everything else amazingly entertaining. My 21 y/o younger brother, 25 y/o older sister, my 3-almost-4 y/o daughter + I all sat down and played with these dolls and this school for at least a good hour. It was Enjoyable for everyone!

B00DQR26EC|5.0|Like title said. I read the reviews and wanted something funny, and yes there is Alot of it. But the game itself is also really good. Would recommend to anyone who wants a good purchased RPG. Who enjoys some laughs with his games.<br />Note though 2 things. 1) Save often cause it may crash from time to time 2) the jump in monster lvl from one area to the next is a little high so slight lvl grinding recommended. Even with that though such a good game still gets 5 stars!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a awesome app, except that you have to wait so long for updates but it's perfect ! Minecraft needs dogs and horses squids and portals
B000UZNSWM|4.0|This is an excellent book.  It's somewhat long, with the first quarter dealing with the military battles and maneuvers but thankfully, the rest of the book deals with how we got into that mess. It is a riveting, incisive and penetrating recounting of MacArthur's megalomania and hubris and how it resulted in the Chinese decision to support the North Koreans. Reading the book, one sees that it could probably been easily avoided at that time.<br /><br />Sadly, looking back at Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan and now Syria, one can easily see that history does indeed repeat itself; but more frequently than we would think.
B00D5O7BPU|4.0|I like the guns, but there Could be more of them. I play around with the guns every day, it calms me.
B00006WKSZ|5.0|Although this release would close the door on the second important phase of the Scorpions career with Uli Jon Roth as their lead guitarist(and, in my opinion, their best guitarist), Tokyo Tapes is very similar in content to that of brother Michael's band UFO and their Strangers in the Night live disc in that the songs featured are a sort of greatest hits live offering. Culled from two different nights at Tokyo's Sun Plaza Hall in the spring of '78 and featuring a 17 track listing, the group's performances are nothing short of extraordinary and definitive within their style of hard rock and the band is at an early peak here. Of course, there would be much more commercial success in store for the band a bit later on, but I prefer this era of the group the best and although, I'm not a die hard fan of the Scorpions, I can certainly draw parallels between them and their contemporaries of the time such as Judas Priest and UFO. With tracks like Steamrock Fever, Speedy's Coming, Fly to the Rainbow, Top of the Bill and Robot Man, one can really hear and appreciate the origins of their crafts being refined and executed to the higher echelons that would pave the way for blockbuster commercial successes like Blackout and Love at First Sting. And so, Tokyo Tapes would prove to be an important milestone for the band's career. A bit further into the bookend of the set, they throw in a couple of old school rock numbers in Elivs' Hound Dog and Little Richard's Long Tall Sally which are exciting covers and offer a little variety to their musical palette. Uli Jon shows off his guitar prowess on numbers like We'll Burn the Sky, Dark Lady, Pictured Life and one of my all time favorites, In Trance, and one can truly hear his Hendrix influence, yet, he also stamps out his own style in the process and therein lies the talent of Mr. Roth. Tracks like Suspender Love, Backstage Queen and the aforementioned Steamrock Fever point towards the commercial aspects that the band would ultimately move towards on their following release Lovedrive, which would see the exit of Uli and the entrance of Matthias Jabs, whose style would prove to be the key ingredient most desirable to their interchanging musical direction. If you're into vintage 70's hard rock, this release is tailormade just for you. However, if you're familiar with Rock You Like a Hurricane and prefer that style, you might want to check out World Wide Live. Tokyo Tapes is where it's at, in my opinion.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|This book seemed to be fragmented.  The author attempts to put the fragments back together towards the end, but it is too contrived to flow very well.
B004SC8XHI|5.0|The music and musicianship of Booker T & the MG's has been acknowledged and revelled in over the years by many critics and fans, myself being among them. When I stumbled upon this release a few months ago, I couldn't wait to hear what would be eminating through the speakers once I hit play. The record sort of works its way backwards opening with a flowing medley of Golden Slumbers/Carry That Weight into The End and then giving way to Here Comes the Sun and jumping to Come Together. As can be expected, the muscianship between Donald &#34;Duck&#34; Dunn, Steve Cropper, Al Jackson,Jr. and Booker T is deliciously impeccable, contemporary and sharp. The way they've arranged the music within, while remaining faithful to compositional continuity, also simultaneously offers their own special spin and interpretation which gives a fresh understanding and slant to the original Abbey Road release. Something by Harrison follows next and displays all of the qualities explained and really offers a beautiful interpretation to an already classic number.<br /><br />Following Something, we are treated to a Because/You Never Give Me Your Money coupling which, in my opinion, works together slightly better than the Beatles counterpart as these songs seamlessly flow into each other. As had begun with the Golden Slumbers medley, the true medley as done by the Beatles in Sun King, Mean Mr. Mustard, Polythene Pam and She Came in Through the Bathroom Window closes the original album by the Mg's with I Want You(She's So Heavy) being added on for astounding measure. The CD reissue in 2011 by the Concord Music Group(Stax Remasters) offers bonus cuts of some more Beatles covers in the forms of You Can't Do That(2 different versions, here), Day Tripper, Michelle, Eleanor Rigby and Lady Madonna, respectively. I especially love their interpretation of Eleanor Rigby because its rather spooky with Booker's organ lines backed with what sounds like an electic piano utilizing a wah-wah pedal for incredible effect. This record is truly a gem to have and no Beatles fan should go without hearing it, period.
B007QJ8VBI|4.0|I remember watching this movie when I was a preteen. Back then it was just Doris and Cary, my favorite actors. But to watch it again as an adult, you realize what the movie is really about. And then you realize that maybe times haven't changed so much in male and female realtionships and expectations in the past 50 years. It was a fun and funny movie. I loved Audrey Meadows and Gig Young in their supporting roles. The misunderstanding between Gig's character and his psychologist is hysterical.
1594489505|4.0|This was an excellent book in its own right. It is just that when you compare it to Kite Runner, it doesn't compete.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|As I read this book, a continuation of the series, I was tempted to read ahead to see the ending. The last page was not as expected but give you apt of food for thought as to an application of the series to us today. Just don't read ahead.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|My wife was reading this book and suggested it to me. It had a lot of interesting points. Each time I thought I figured out what happened, there was a twist and things changed.
B009K0P10K|4.0|I'm enjoying this series, as it is the right amount of suspense. Not brilliant, but entertaining and I will finish it.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Better than stock android kb for sure. Predicton engine works well.<br />Takes a while to get used to if you have used stock kb for a long time.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|everyone know about it, what else to say, cant and anything more than that :)<br />just great classic game, one more word :)
B0036S4B6M|3.0|I was expecting a more entertaining story, kind of a &#34;I am woman hear me roar&#34; story. I lost interest about half way through.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|really like it altough I worry about the privacy, its a gread keyboard, so easy to use, better than original android
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|I got this app when my flight was delayed for quite some time. It kept me entertained the entire time in the airport and on the plane. I would definitely recommend this app to anyone trying kill time.
B0043RSJ8G|4.0|I loved this book, couldn't put it down! It was very true to life and had an.awesome ending!! Everyone has a heart
B00ELD3MUW|1.0|Tried to download it on to my kindle.  The kindle was returned and I never tried the installer or tester.
B00846WWVM|5.0|The game is too good. Very simple but addictive game....I love it!! My son also like it......cool game....five stars.......now my favourite.
B007L6VR12|5.0|Bill Murray and Bruce Willis in a surprisingly humorous, but serious, look at puppy love.  Two young people decide that they are &#34;in Love&#34;, so they decide to run away together.  The only problem is that a serious hurricane is bearing down on the small island where they live.  Murray and Willis are very good in their roles, and the rest of the cast is excellent as well.  A must see, I think, for the whole family.
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|This movie was not what I thought it was going to be. It was a good movie, but I expected MORE action. I would watch it again.
0783225482|5.0|Meryl Streep, Bruce Willis, and Goldie Hawn in an hilarious take on immortality.  Meryl and Goldie take an immortality drug and then it's a catfight to see who can live the longest and stay the most beautiful.  Well acted and tastefully done, this should be a movie that all will enjoy.
1469259273|4.0|I gave this four stars and feel like there is a five star book hidden in there if the author could have shed about 2/3 of the words he used on the topics of music and women [though most of these come in the first person and, perhaps, are intentional character development] and gotten a bit more feedback on describing physical activities.<br /><br />It's a fantasy novel, and so there is an expectation that the parts of the story will feel like they are \\"fantasy\\" (as some of the activities are necessarily foreign), but the author does a wonderful job (in my opinion) of handling both the magical and linguistic descriptions in the story . . . it is the combat and \\"exercise\\" descriptions that feel foreign.<br /><br />That said, I think the author is very good as is the underlying story.  I will buy the third book when it becomes available.
B0058W74UY|1.0|This product was downloaded to my kindle fire, but I never used it.  I returned the kindle fire to Amazon.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Not our feelings about the publisher, the pricing or the wait time between books.  The author controls only the content of the book--which was fabulous.  Gideon and Eva are all grown up and acting like it.  SD is a brilliant writer and there are even places where this book reads like prose.<br /><br />Listen to our Completely Scandalicious Nerd Herd Podcast at<br /><br />[...]
1452101426|5.0|Such an amazing book with designs from the movie. I would recommend it to all the Brave and animation fans out there!

1557048630|5.0|Such a beautiful book filled with concept art from the movie. Totally worth buying it. I can't wait for the next movie!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Good game even my daughter loves it everyone should download this great for all age. And very addicting too but a little slow pace
B00CP2Z5TC|2.0|was hoping for more of the 1st two albums. songs are slow. not catchy like the previous album's songs.  they lack that fast beat and great guitar work, which i thought was their strong point on previous albums.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Enjoyed the movie very much.  Great escape from the everyday blood and guts and aliens we are being subjected in most moves.
0143117009|4.0|Why I read this book:<br /><br />I had seen Jared Diamond's earlier book Guns, Germ, and Steel but had never gotten around to reading it. There is something fascinating at why some societies thrive and others fail. I've always had an interest in the rise and fall of the Roman Empire. So Collapse was a read I couldn't resist when it came to a book buying round at Amazon.<br /><br />My one sentence summary:<br /><br />Societies that over-exploits their resources are doomed to fail, especially in a fragile and hostile environment, unless the problems are recognized and addressed.<br /><br />Kuddos:<br /><br />The book is divided into four parts. Being a history nut, I was drawn to part two on past societies. Diamond presents a highly readable and interesting overview of what is known about several societies that have failed and ones that have succeeded. His interpretation about what led to the downfall of the former is compelling and presents some important (context specific) examples.<br /><br />My second favorite part was the third part about modern societies. I was horrified to read about the ecological context of the Rwandan genocides and the cycle of violence set up by over-population and over-exploitation of precious resources. There are successes mixed in with the horrors that do show hope for the future.<br /><br />Quibbles:<br /><br />Diamond tends to go on. Often times I felt like I was re-reading the same information as he recaps often when making his final points for each chapter. I also found my attention wandering when it came to the first and fourth parts of the book that focus on modern Montana and practical lessons.<br /><br />Final Verdict:<br /><br />This is a book has a place on my book shelf. It contains a many historical lessons that were learned the hard way. While I'm still getting used to reading books with a message, I think the ones Diamond puts forth are important.
B00ECU2SGS|5.0|Acting was great by all, very realistic in their accents and general movements.  Highly recommend.  Matthew McConaughey showed his ability to play almost any role.
B0053O89WY|5.0|We now have all five of the season sets. The Big Bang Theory is our favorite TV show. All of the characters compliment each other with the lead and punch line. The fifth season DVD set came earlier than the &#34;estimated arrival date&#34;. The set was well packaged.
B0060V1WJ6|1.0|Did not watch all of it, very disappointed in the story and the acting.  I would not recommend it to anyone.
B003B02O3C|4.0|Once I started reading this book, had to finish at one sitting.  Fine work, keeps interest..surprise ending.. not what I expected
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is AWESOME! I highly recommend it to anyone trying to kill time, or giving the kids something to do. GET THIS APP!!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I ride horses and it is really important for me to be able to quickly calculate the Heat Stress Index using the current temperature and humidity. This app is great for that. I can pull up what I need in just a couple of clicks, and view it by the hour, so I have a better chance of riding on a hot day when the Heat Stress Index will be lowest.
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|usual free apps of the day came with hundreds of votes and ads. this app isnt very intrusive and doesnt bribe for votes. no in game purchases and pretty neat by itself
B000VDDDY6|5.0|Aw, come on!  It's the original Star Trek!!!  What more needs to be said.  If you don't love it, there's something wrong with you.  Fantastic!!!
B009FZHYKU|3.0|Not sure I like this as well as the first two seasons. Haven't watched the whole third season, so should defer judgement until I do.
B000JCSBU0|5.0|Artistically made! Interesting camera shots, intense, always wanted to know what would happen next. Made me wish there was a part two
B00AKO93JK|4.0|Needs to have a little more time in between the exercises, but all in all nice choice of time frames and some good exercises.  I would definitely recommend getting the paid version so you don't have to view the commercial interruptions.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I thought the story was good. Lots of fun details that all come together. Just don't read the book then watch the movie. The movie took too many liberties to and trashed the good storyline.
B004AQR29C|3.0|Not really good, and not a send up of anything in particular, but nor horrible either.  Was expecting possibly something a little more &#34;campy&#34; or something more like &#34;RED&#34;, but wasn't.  Not sure I want to watch the sequal.

B00DC7N9NS|4.0|I was not quite sure what to expect.  Love &#34;The Wizard of Oz&#34; so am always skeptical about newer versions of old classics that come out.  This one works quite well.  Hoping there are sequals.
B00DQBWLSO|2.0|I wish I could return this CD for a refund! I have all of John Mayer's other studio albums and I love all of them! But this CD just seems shallow and sing-songey. Out of the 11 songs on the CD, 2 were not written by John, and one is sung by Frank Ocean. Some of the rhymes seem sophomoric, \\"strap into some heals that hurt, you shoulda kept my under shirt\\". Is it just me? This CD does not have the depth and apparent thought process of his others.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Unlike &#34;The Expendables&#34;, this movie was just a lot of fun.  Love all the cameos in it.  The cast works very well together, and they obviously just had a lot of fun with it.  I would definitely recommend this movie!
