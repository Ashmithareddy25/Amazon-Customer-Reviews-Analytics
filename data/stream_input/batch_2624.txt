B00C061I3K|5.0|As Thomas Bangalter said in an interview, \\"EDM is having an Identity Crisis\\" and this album is the cure for it! for those of you who are expecting massive bass drops and crazy sounds overlapping one another, overlook this album and go buy the new Knife Party or Deadmau5 album. This is an entirely new spin on the EDM scene and some may even say that Disco is officially back due to its funky grooves and organic basslines. still not convinced? go to randomaccessmemories.com and watch the Collaborators series, then make a decision about buying.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|It is so amazing, and I'm so happy that you had it on here, because I love this book so much
B000021XR5|3.0|this album is definitely a grower. one that you don't get right away but instead over time with repeated listens.<br /><br />the production is sort of like a return to core. but the sound here is even heavier.almost metal sounding. this cd sounds much better than shangri la dee da and the new 2010 album.<br /><br />however it fails to constantly deliver. \\"down\\" sets a great tone..but the only other song on that level is no way out.<br /><br />sour girl is a terrific song. but now i have come to appreciate atlanta as the best song on the album.<br /><br />other great tracks are glide and i got you. i also like church on tuesday. the rest of the tracks feel like filler to me.<br />and thats the problem. core had no filler. purple had no filler. and imo tiny music had no filler.<br /><br />after digesting this album it feels like they almost did it. almost made another masterpiece but fell short.

B0062QRTKA|5.0|This app is fun and addicting. I just got it today in the free app day of the day. I play it on my kindle fire HD. Everyone who looking for something to kill time and challenges should play this game. It's worth the dollar too. This app is a good example of a good app.
B002ZG9774|5.0|better movie than anyone would think.  some of the best dancing you'll ever get to see and Christine A. can sing her ass off.
B006VFLIYK|3.0|The Innocent is a bestseller, so imagine my surprise when after reading a 100 pages I was wondering how many more to go. It started with a lot of steam, but fizzled slowly. Dialogue was choppy, dry, and stiff. The action was pretty good, but in beteen were pages that made me feel like I was traveling a vast desert looking for water puddles. The book fail to summon only a minimum amount of suspense. If anyone of the main characters had died (except for the girl) I would not have felt even a tinge of pain. There are a few twists, but they are so random you are like \\"What?!!!\\" I recommend Steven James for real suspense. This a nice intro into the genre.
B00A23MYCC|5.0|This movie is crude, rude and wonderful. I laugh out loud even when I'm watching it alone.  However, when I bought the movie it tried to start playing instantly.  That didn't work so well.  Trying to stop the movie so I could restart it didn't work, either.  So, I had to unplug and replug my Roku to restart the movie and have it run cleanly.  This glitch did not occur with any of the other movies I bought, nor with any of the tv shows I purchased.  I'm very glad I have the movie, though, since I am enjoying it so very much, and can't wait for my husband to see it.  I have had no further problems with playback.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game that is fun to play and challenges you to pay attention to detail.  Helps you work your memory recall.

B009NY43NY|3.0|I love the Sookie Stackhouse series but the final book left me sad.  I did not like the ending with Eric but did approve of Sam as a possible mate for Sookie.  I think there should have been much more to the series.

B008BDZOZY|5.0|From the first listen through of this album, I was hooked.  David Byrne brings his Talk Heads experience and mixes it with St. Vincent's unique style.  Search &#34;David Byrne & St. Vincent Who&#34; on Youtube to hear the single &#34;Who&#34; and if you dig it, pick up this album.  Enjoy!
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|They promised the original mixes of their first 5 albums would be part of this set, and they kept that promise. Plus three of the albums (ZZ Top's First Album, Rio Grande Mud, and Tejas) are available on compact disc in their original mixes for the first time ever in this set (Tres Hombres and &#34;Fandango!&#34; had been released on CD in their original mixes already back in 2006), and it's very affordable too being only $40 or $50 depending on where you buy it. That's the same price as a new PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 game. A couple of gripes though:<br /><br />1.There's no extra artwork or bonus tracks<br />2.They aren't remastered (but then again, maybe that's a good thing)<br />3.The labels on the disc look exactly the same as the original releases, only they have the current WB logo instead of the one the older pressings had, and Recycler has a label just like those instead of the one it had when it originally came out.<br />4.It claims to have all the original artwork, but the ones that have inner sleeves such as Tres Hombres, Fandango!, Tejas and Deguello that had custom inner sleeves with their original artwork are not included, and they should have those also (the 2012 remastered version of David Bowie's classic &#34;Ziggy Stardust&#34; album which had an LP-style packaging also had an inner sleeve replica, so why not these?)<br /><br />But other than that, this is a great set that is worth owning that's very affordable. Must have.
B000RZIGVS|4.0|DVD menu is a bit confusing. It is two episodes per disc.<br />The storage case is cheesy but still very organized.

B002VECLVO|5.0|I only got this movie because it has Tom Ford written all over it. Directed by Tom Ford. Pretty much.<br /><br />I've never read the book but the storyline is amazing. It only occurs in about two days. Little dialogue but the fashion, mannerisms, and setting completes it.

B000U6BT40|5.0|Great actors, characters, story line...I was disappointed when each one ended. It is my just before I go to sleep addiction. Interesting and lighthearted but always with real world revelation that when we try to play God it doesn't work.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Had a blast trying to figure out what went where. Kept pen and paper to help remember combinations. Wish there was more levels.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|After watching the movie, I really wanted the chance to compare it to the book. This is probably one of the first times I've ever gone from movie to book, and in some ways it was disorienting. While I loved the letter style of the book, it took me a bit to get used to. Regardless, the plot line was engaging, even to those no longer in high school. I think I had expected some more action though.<br /><br />All I can really think is, thank goodness my own high school years weren't filled with this much tumult.
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|It's a little better than your average Red Box/Netflix movie rental, so I really liked it.  Didn't love it as much as Avengers, but it was a great &#34;prequel&#34; to it.  If you watched Avengers before watching this, then Cpt America is a better prequel than Thor or the Iron Man series.  The ending was a little wierd and wished that the author's thought it out more.  It seems like towards the end they were struggling to fit as much of the movie into as little time possible.  There is like 15-20 minutes of plot that could have been added to have taken the movie from good to great.
0060555661|5.0|This book is a little bit in depth and hard to understand. It was in perfect shape and I received it quickly but don't know how helpful it will be.

B00028HBKM|5.0|Brings to like the apex of what God, and Jesus sacrificed to bring us grace and freedom through the cross. What confounds man is God's desire to bring us to Him even when it meant sacrificing His son so we could fully be His children. A must see for anyone who wonders if God really loves you.
B002ZCY7PU|5.0|We started watching Chuck during the second season and loved it so we bought the first season.  Bought all the seasons on Amazon.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|I loved this movie. It's funny and the ladies have wit. I didn't experience a dull moment. It gives is an insight on how colored people were treated in this time.
0470449764|5.0|A great additional resource for getting more quant help.  It continues basically where the OG leave's off and provides you with more problems to practice, that's it.
B00475AYJQ|1.0|While I still enjoyed some parts of The Name of the Wind, I disliked the ending. It just got boring and there was almost no advance at the end. The protagonist Kvothe even started to me irritate me more and more (something I normally never feel while reading a book).<br />I decided to give this book a chance in the hope it was good, but boy was I wrong.<br /><br />The first part continues the saga of Kvothe @ university. It almost felt like reading a boring version of the Harry Potter series.<br />Next, Kvothe goes to a baron somewhere far away. From there the hunt after a group of villains start, but don't imagine to tempo of the story to pick up nor does it get exciting from here.<br />I'm not quite sure why this book has more than 1000 reviews here on Amazon. The writing skills of Rothfuss are far inferior to almost any fantasy author I've ever read.
B008MWBY6W|5.0|I really liked this Camera Case.<br /><br />I could put my Nikon 3100 and a Sigma 70-300mm Lens in the same Bag.<br />There is also some pockets to put the SD Cards and extra battery.<br /><br />Wonderful product from AmazonBasics
B004SIIBGU|4.0|What's not to like about this App.  It takes you right to  the web site...  I like having the App with me and the ability to go on line to Ebay.

B0028KF4M4|5.0|I am a huge fan of the Dexter series.  Season three is probably my least favorite of all the seasons.  That being said Dexter season 3 is still phenomenal.  It's very well written and always interesting to watch.  Dexter is one of my favorite shows to watch!
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|A colorful movie with some lovable characters.  But ultimately it is a fun story with little in the way of hard thought.  The tie-ins with the Wizard of Oz are creative.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book ties together several generations in a creative story that is enjoyable to read.  The prose is a refreshing change from the mass produced, popular books.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Best series I've ever had the pleasure of reading. Can't wait for next installment...coming soon I hope. Don't want to pick up anything till then.

B0058W74UY|1.0|I must have techie issues because I was unable to use it.  Actually didn't like the other download options either.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This movie is excellent and great quality. Happy to see that amazon has it in the prime library. I can't wait until the remainder of this series is made into movies!
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|In this saturated game called hip hop, I relish the moment when real artist make an album. Classic. Definatly a must have.
B001THZAAI|1.0|I suppose I must have been away from France way too long.  If this is one of the most popular films in France, I am extremely dismayed not to mention shocked to current French taste.  I found this film completely stupid, asinine and not the least bit funny.
B005V2EVBQ|1.0|Not an acceptable product. Folding stand is useless and overpriced. I would return but can't as am about to leave on a trip and won't travel without a case.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I was very disappointed that I can not listen to my already purchased and new books on my new Android.  I think this is something that needs to be looked into.  I like to listen to my books while I work.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Because awesome does not cover it!<br /><br />The science is clever and relevant. I would like more technology but the acting is amazing.<br />I will be shocked if there are not more awards for this show.
B001DF6GEU|5.0|Came in a plastic sleeve with a poster of the album art, no scratches or deformities and played perfectly. Great album, would recommend it to anyone
B003JTHXOK|4.0|The book was definitely better than the book!!!  The book was very well written and kept you interested in what was going on.  It had a few surprises that you didn't see coming either.  Fun summer read! :)
B002RI9TB4|5.0|No aspects of this book 'put me off'<br />Huge impact as it gave some insight into the story of Biafra
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Genuinely entertaining and fun. Played through in one setting, were addictive. Can't wait for a sequel. Definitely a must buy.
B000N5F6OW|5.0|I love this movie. I have seen it a lot of times and its just as good as it was the first time I saw it. I have the Dvd and I have a player by my bed and I watch it some nights till I fall a sleep. Great movie.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time.  We watched seasons 1,2 and 3 in a couple of weeks.<br />We can't wait for season 4!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|so many different choices and most are fun. though I do I find it difficult to save my points because I spend them so quickly
B00785P2QC|4.0|wow I love get it free now ok made a huge city just for me and they more games by g5 so check them out have fun.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I got this game for my son and he loves it then I started playing now I am addicted great job Halfbrick.
B005HJU7HA|3.0|I love the book, however, there are typos in the book that kind of kill your flow of writing.  There are also times when the font just changes randomly.  It will be a paragraph in a larger sans serif font in the middle of a chapter.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Very compelling story because of the characters. Glad I read this. Very engaging and enjoyable for adults as well as teens.
B00BQ1D7X4|2.0|Jerry found an awesome harmony with his lead singer on this album.  The problem is, the same harmony is used throughout the entire piece.  Every song sound similar and the album gets boring quickly.  If you only play one song at a time in a random mix the harmony and the music is great, I just did not need 45 minutes of the same sound.
B0091REZMW|4.0|good game so far....<br />haven't delved in too much yet but looking forward to it. seems like it will be interesting. my husband will like it too.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|Great movie!  Excellent prequel to the original.<br /><br />Video playback was not great through my Sony bluray, but was better through my Roku.  In retrospect, with my 1.5Mb DSL Connection, I probably wouldn't spend the extra money on the HD version.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Someone make this into a movie.  Very rarely do you find a book that you really HATE to put down.  I can't wait to read the next one.
B009ZQJ1G4|4.0|Equilibrium is certainly a very interesting movie. I'm not a big fan of &#34;gun porn&#34; which this movie absolutely is, but the sci-fi setting in which this is based was just fascinating. To live in a world where you're not allowed to feel emotion in order to live a peace, and for it to actually succeed? Very cool.<br /><br />My main problem with this movie is that it is extremely anti-climactic and the protagonist is too powerful. Under no point was his life in danger, it was the equivalent of watching Superman vanquish enemies without the threat of Kryptonite. He never bled, he was never exhausted, he merely executed everyone with ease. Sure this made him into a bad ass character, but there was no drama. It's fine to watch a character perform flawlessly during the beginning stages of a story where they haven't met their match. It's different when the character is about to face their final confrontation.<br /><br />I was really hoping for an epic battle with his partner, but instead the character just gets killed off immediately. Everything just went too according to plan, and left the movie severely lacking in drama that compelled you to root for the character.<br /><br />Either, still a very cool movie to watch if you're interested in a dystopian sci-fi world.
B006ZB3V2C|3.0|Many free apps allow for more than 1 alarm to be set.  If you don't remember to turn off the alarm feature, it wakes you up on days when you don't need an alarm!<br /><br />Great for the free app of the day, but others out there are far better!
B00BQ1DAHC|4.0|Well, I got what I expected and a little bit more.  It took me several listens to hear the subtle differences in the songs.  When you only play one song at a time from the album it is great, but the problem is, the songs have such a similar sound to each other that you can get bored listening to the entire piece back to back songs.  Would have been nice to see them put some more variety into their album.  Saw them live at Rockfest in Kansas City this year and they put on a most excellent live show.  They played a version of a Johnny Cash song that absolutely rocked 50,000 of us.
B005I6EU48|5.0|Fits my Fire great and looks awesome!  The first few days it did not close flat but now, about 4-5 days later it closes flat and looks great!  The corner straps are secure and I am completely happy with this purchase!
B00DF0POXA|4.0|The music on this album is great, but lacks in lyrical content and is the only reason I gave him 4 stars. Its hard to follow what message he is trying to deliver with-in his lyrics. Then again with all the trash pop-rap out now, is anybody really listening to lyrics anymore?  Kanye did a great job of switching things up by not following the same beat structures that this tarnished industry keeps repeating. The album has a sort of MBDTF and 808 &HB vibe to it, but a lot more thought provoking. In listening to this album numerous amounts of times I have experienced, thoughts, emotions, and ideas that have surfaced from with-in myself which have been inspiring. Codos to Kanye for delivering this work of art, this fresh of breathe air not only in the rap industry, but in the music industy in general.
B00BYISRC0|5.0|You know that moment when you find your favorite song or tv show or movie, but you don't know it yet - you just know you like it - so you keep listening or watching until you realize you can't live without it? That is this album.<br /><br />The first few times I listened to Trouble Will Find Me, I didn't think it measured up to the absolute perfection of High Violet. But I kept listening to it on repeat and at some point I realized it is a perfect album. Like their albums before it, I found myself getting stuck on a song and playing it over and over and over. My favorite right now is Pink Rabbits...<br /><br />If you haven't already bought this album, stop reading reviews and buy it.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Wreck-it Ralph is a very entertaining and enjoyable movie. It's definitely got tons of references for gamers, but in the end, it's a kids movie through and through.<br /><br />There's a lot of humorous comedy in this movie and a few touching moments with the girl character, but in the end... I was really disappointed with the emphasis on Candy land. I was hoping that this movie would take place within his own world or a different game that gamers would better relate to, but instead it was all in candy land. Placing it in this setting made me feel like I was watching a movie that was aimed specifically for kids, rather than say... Toy Story where both adults and children could get the joke.<br /><br />Also, Sarah Silverman as the girl (glitch) character is grating. It's not really the character itself that's annoying, but the voice, ugh... who thought that casting was a good idea? Overall, definitely a movie for kids, but not quite geared enough for adults and gamers.
B007SGM084|5.0|I love the text.  Easy to read, story line one of the best.  gives one the feeling of being apart of the story.  I wish I could have told ana, to just enjoy being loved.  I had some of the same distrusts as her.  But was able to relate to the fairytale of this storyline.  great read
030758836X|3.0|Am I the only person who didn't 'get' the ending? Or was I just expecting something more dramatic? Perhaps I had just gone off Nick and Amy by then.
0156012197|4.0|This is one of those classic short stories that holds so many different meanings depending on who is reading it. We explored this story in my &#34;Philosophy of Healthcare&#34; class, and found that its lessons applied well to our course. It's a very simple book, easily read as a childs bedtime story, but can also be deeply explored by an adult reader who can find hidden meanings within its text.
B00A2H9P98|4.0|Can a movie be preposterous and involving at the same time? Start with a fellow who has just been rejected for a Secret Service job at the White House and his little girl who was thrilled to go along with Daddy to this storied place, as they are swept into a hosted White House tour. Now mix in some high level terrorists capturing the White House with ruthless violence and the answer is \\"Yes\\" for one simple reason: We have someone to root for.<br /><br />This PG-13 outing directed by Roland Emmerich (\\"Independence Day\\" this guy LOVES to blow up the White House!) is another CGI-fest that has an adequate (but predictable) 100-minute story that is beefed up to 131 minutes with endless gunfights, fist fights and blowie uppie stuff. Granted there must be some fighting, given the topic, but enough is enough!<br /><br />These folks did a fine job:<br />  * Channing Tatum (\\"Magic Mike\\") is Cale, the fellow who takes his daughter with him to the White House. Cale is a veteran of three tours in the mid-East, so he is no stranger to military tactics.<br />  * Jamie Foxx (\\"Django\\") is President Sawyer, earnest and frightened but dedicated to the IDEA of America, not to just one individual.<br />  * Joey King (\\"Ramona and Beezus\\") is Emily, a little girl with a cell phone. She gets separated from Daddy and is scared to death when she sees what's happening, but she's made of pretty stern stuff.<br />  * Maggie Gyllenhaal (\\"Hysteria\\") is Finerty, an official with the Secret Service; she has just rejected Cale for that security job.<br />  * James Woods (\\"Jobs\\") is Walker, the head of the agency. He is smart and focused, but may be ill....<br />  * Michael Murphy (Lots of TV) is Vice President Hammond, whisked off to Air Force One for safe keeping.<br />  * Richard Jenkins (\\"Jack Reacher\\") is Raphelson, Speaker of the House. If the President and Vice President are annihilated, the Constitution says this modest fellow is next in line.<br />  * Jason Clarke (\\"The Great Gatsby\\") is once again, extremely effective as a bad guy. Stentz is a paramilitary leader, powerful, smart and determined to win this audacious power grab.<br />  * Nicolas Wright (Lots of TV) provides delicious bits of humor as Donnie the Guide, a gabby fellow who leads White House tours.<br /><br />Despite over-the-top violence, we enjoy little bits of humor and appreciate the in-depth tour of the White House. Brace yourself for unexpected twists, some unwelcome political bias, no sweaty bodies and surprisingly little profanity. Be aware that key plot points are whispered while victims are hiding from armed thugs, so if you have any hearing problems, find a theater that offers closed captions, or wait for the DVD from Amazon.<br /><br />Always remember to suspend disbelief!
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|Loved how they took scary zombie world and made it into a love story awesome turn around and funny. Watch it!
B009XY97VC|5.0|So, I love instrumental music. It first started with E.S. Posthumous and continued to grow when I discovered Two Steps From Hell.<br /><br />When I love a track or feel my mind creating visuals for some epic movie trailer or thrilling fight scene. I rewind the track and play it from that key moment in the song over and over again.<br /><br />Well I discovered at least 4 tracks where I did this! Skyworld, El Dorado, Titanfall, Icarus, For the Win. Actually that's 5, wait no... I also liked Dark Ages which makes that 6.<br /><br />This is an album full of epic sound tracks that I found myself replaying over and over again. It's like I mentally become a movie director and start visualizing scenes that excite my imagination to no end.<br /><br />That being said, I really don't like the lyrical songs that appear in the sound track. The auto tuned voice singing songs and the disney esque voice was a huge turn off. So much so, that I skip the track entirely. Which is not to say I don't like their soft songs, in fact I love them, and have often visualized them for photo albums. But the auto tuned lyrical songs are terrible and certainly not a strong point for the Two Steps team.<br /><br />I'd much rather prefer they continue their bombastic instrumental tracks than to continue expanding into songs with more lyrics. The only lyrical songs I do like of theirs, is when they're repeating words rather than trying to tell a story through melody.
B0015DROBO|3.0|The plot line was very good and kept my interest.  The Mikael Blomkvist character was frustrating to me.  His relationship with Berger is not quite believable to members.  He doesn't care if she's married? I guess they do things different in Sweden.  I skimmed thru all of the technical jargon.  Didn't make sense to me. I might read the next one in the series if I can get it cheap.<br /><br />I

B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|If your looking for something that opens up your creative imaginary mind you will love this movie Tom and Halle were great! Watch it!
B005MMY5RK|2.0|For me, it seems that the love of Citizen Kane stems around what it did to break ground for the movie industry, rather than actually being an entertaining piece. In fact, the movie is quite boring, a fact which I attribute to the fact that the film was just too over-hyped. Too many people said that it was the greatest movie ever, and when you go to watch it with that expectation, you can't help but feel disappointed.<br /><br />I think people are more in love with the lore surrounding the movie rather than the actual film itself, which is a real chore to watch. The camera shots were interesting, the lighting was interesting, the FX makeup was well done, but the entertainment value was sorely lacking. Casablanca on the other hand was a much more interesting movie and had elements to keep you engaged.<br /><br />Citizen Kane however, is just a boring story of a man who couldn't buy happiness with all the power he had accumulated.
B001QJUX24|5.0|The Searchers is one of John Wayne's best movies: the scenery is breath taking and pristine; the acting is great; the script is excellent and  original. This movie does justice to the Indian side of how hard progress is on every one.  It also helps explain how love lives on through the hard times. Faith in what you really know and believe in is so important, no matter how long it taks to fix what is wrong. And things can always be OK again.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Our book club choose this book to read and it provided plenty of discussion.  This book makes you think a lot about right and wrong and how that might change when it involves your own family.  There are several surprises in &#34;Defending Jacob&#34;.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|I kept hearing about this show and wanted to see what the fuss was all about.  It's fairly cheesy to begin with.  The graphics and costumes in season one are super lame.  They do get a little better in season two.  I'm definitely addicted.  :)
B0094M2Z9O|4.0|I enjoyed watching this film.  It had an excellent cast and had a good story line.  It reminded me a lot of &#34;The Great Escape&#34; regarding the POWs which I thought it showed an interesting contrast to; East vs. West of how the prisoners were regarded by their captors.
B00A6N8F4Y|5.0|This is an awesome drug war movie...if you like intense events that movies are putting out there... that are really happening in everyday life today right under our noses this movie hits the mark...
0061730335|3.0|Nice product, quality OK and came very early!<br />I am very happy with this.<br />Fun and simple book, with a nice message!
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|I Really enjoyed this series and I was very satisfied with this conclusion.  It is kind of nice to know that it was put together the way that Robert Jordan wanted it to be.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|very good. many elements similar to the 2013 version.  includes a new sealed deck mode that offers the chance to build your own customized deck
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Best series I have seen, even slightly better than sopranos or boardwalk empire which were really great series in my opinion
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I don't like to review, but I really like this tool.  Great for accessing files on my desktop machines and either streaming music to my tablets and phones, or viewing pictures.  Copying files back and forth works great, too.
B00BF11STU|3.0|HURT LOCKER WAS BETTER!...This one was kinda predictable...if your looking for a better seal team movie Act of Valor would be it.

B009XIXVU6|4.0|This is a good book. I love this author. It's been two weeks since I finished this book and its hard to recall the very long list of characters. It's complicated...maybe a bit too complicated. It bounces from one character to another and zig zags back and forth across time. It makes for lively book club conversation but doesn't have the staying power of The Kite Runner. Fans will enjoy it. New readers may be harder to hook.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Every now and then out of all the books I read, one will stand out and grab my attention.  This is one of those books.  I was pulled into this world and barely slept till the last page.  Thanks for a great book and I can't wait for the next one.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Oh yes. This book just made me angry. And now I am almost finished with 30 days on a low carb high fat diet a la Jimmy Moore and I've lost 8.5 pounds already.  My doctor, my dietitian, my pharmacist- they all are still recommending low fat diets. My dietitian told me that &#34;no one will support you here&#34; when I told her I was a low carb eater. &#34;we don't support fads.&#34; I am still shaking my head. What is it going to take for the medical community to realize that low carb is NOT a fad - it is a choice. And a valid one. I'm also reading Low Carbohydrate Living and looking for as much as I can on low carb diets in general and specifically therapeutic diets.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Played the original and liked it.  Played 13 &amp; liked it.  So far, M14 is better than the others in so many ways that I can't put it down.  Love the ability to unlock decks right in the game and think the price is reasonable ($0.99).  I'll wear out my tablet playing this version.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|This is one of the best movie Jamie has ever made...I loved his character and the roll he played awesome acting! Watch it!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Great story. Great characters. Great costumes, cinematography- did the book proud. Hated to see it end. On to Season 3.
B009R659L8|4.0|I love Mary Higgins Clark's style of writing. Although I guessed the ending (one of the few times with one of her books), I enjoyed this book a lot.
B002KS1IJC|4.0|There are monsters, vikings, and a spaceship. While that sounds odd and mind-numbing, this movie puts it together well. It does explain the unusual events which may at first seem scattered. It is a great view for any science fiction fan.
B005723JSQ|5.0|This book was funny in so many parts I had to stop reading it at work during my lunch hours, with all the strange looks I was getting. It's super easy to put yourself it the character's situations and ask yourself what would I do? I love Sophie Kisella's other books and REALLY enjoyed this book. I look forward to the next book she puts out.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|This is one of the best true story movies I've seen in along time. this movie was excellent Ben Affleck did an amazing job. I was blown away on how well this movie was made. the actors did a great job at their roles. and I was impressed that they found actors who came close to looking like the real people. I can't say much more than what I have said that that this movie is a must see. and a good history story. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do
B00CHI5F5S|5.0|Its about time they tell a story about crime bosses coming through LA...I loved the story line and a great cast made it even much better to watch and enjoy. Watch it 110% !
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It's unlike the other books in that it goes back and forth in time but it helps you understand the character s better.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My kids are having a blast caring for their horse flower.  I am also enjoying the game.<br />I would recommend this game to everyone.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|Our family has always enjoyed the Toy Story series.  We saw each movie in the theater, and now we have our own copy of these movies to watch anytime we wish. :-)
B0051T47NQ|5.0|The action and cg in this film is great. It has a slight Blair Witch feel, but with better acting and cinematography. The views of Norwegian countryside alone is worth the price of the film! There are breathtaking vistas, in clear weather and rain, but it doesn't detract from the pace of the film.<br /><br />However... If you don't speak/enjoy hearing Norwegian or you don't like subtitles, don't bother. The English track is ATROCIOUS! The voice actors (if they can be called that) were completely emotionless, as if they hadn't seen the film at all, or were just reading from scripts. It was ridiculous, and lost all the grip in the action. Don't watch the movie in English!
B007REV4YI|5.0|This bond movie is awesome. I would have to say that this is one of the best in the series. is this the last one? if you watch very carefully at the end when the new m gives bond a folder it says dr. no on it for those who have not seen the movie sorry for giving that away but you might of missed it. I hope they don't remake dr. no that would be a terrible idea. I love the james bond films but I think they should let him rest. all good thing have to come to an end sometimes. but all in all this was a good installment to the series. but you never know with Hollywood. if they do make another I will definatly see it. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do
B00A7ZXDLQ|5.0|This album was the best I've heard in awhile. Rihanna is a pure musical genus.<br />I'm happy I purchased this CD. I'm a big fan now.
B00DBSZJRM|2.0|Not as good as expected. Story was weak. Movie couldn't decide if it wanted to be a family story or adult story with F bombs everywhere
B003R50FRI|5.0|If this was fiction, the author would be criticized for being to far fetched.  But this is the truth.<br />This is an amazing story of a person who has his faults, but is seeking to make amends. Faced with difficult choices, having to make choices no one would want to make, this is an amazing journey
B006PFC2S2|5.0|i had to stop and restart due to un forseen events and there was not one problem i would watch it again
B004I2K4E8|5.0|Les Miz is a morality play.<br /><br /> In the Old Testament, God, the Creator of the Universe, feeds the hungry, comforts the broken-hearted, releases the imprisoned, and defends the weak.  Justice is equated with mercy.  In the New Testament, St. Joseph does not openly condemn Mary. his betrothed, (according to the custom of the times, the Blessed Virgin Mary, being pregnant out of wedlock, would have been stoned to death; her father, according to the Talmud, would have been the one to have to hand her over to the mob) because he was &#34;a righteous man.&#34;  Again, righteousness is equated with mercy. In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus tells a parable.  God separates the sheep from the goats.  He turns to the sheep and says to them that when he was hungry, they had fed him, when he was in prison they had visited him, when he was sick, they had nursed him.  The sheep were absolutely dumbfounded.  &#34;When did we see you hungry and feed you...et cetera, et cetera, et cetera?&#34;.  Whereupon the Lord God Almighty, King of the Universe, Creator of the heavens and the earth and all flora and fauna therein, informed them that whenever they had performed these acts of kindnesses toward any of the least of these their brethren, they had done it to the Master of the Universe.  Heady stuff that.  The goats did not fare so well.  They were thrown on the trash heap of Gehenna, burned up and forgotten.<br /><br />There you have it:  the moral conflict between Javert (the pseudo-righteous man) who equates justice and righteousness with The Law and Punishment versus Jean Valjean, (the truly righteous man; the sinner redeemed) who equates justice and righteousness with Mercy and Sacrifice and Protection of the Vulnerable.<br /><br />The 25th Anniversary Concert (Blu-ray) is magnificent.  The voices are superb.  Superb is an understatement.  I was absolutely blown away.  Although this event is a concert, all the songs are delivered by members of the London cast.  The actors are never out of character.  Les Miz is, essentially, an opera.  Consequently, if all the songs are sung, the story line remains intact. And all the songs are sung.<br /><br />The first time I saw this performance, I downloaded it on my DVR--all 280 minutes of it--from PBS.  I could not bring myself to erase it . I needed the minutes, so I finally ordered the Blu-ray version from Amazon.  I still did not dare to erase anything until I viewed the DVD and was absolutely certain every minute was included.  You see, at the end, after the curtain calls, the original cast (there have been 4 consecutive casts for the long-running London production) came out.  The audience  went wild.  THEN the four tenors who sang the John Valjean part came out and sang &#34;Bring Him Home&#34;.  THEN, hundreds of young people who have participated in school productions  marched in singing the stirring call to revolution.  It was truly a night to remember, and I have not told you the half of it.  The original playrights from France were there.  All that was missing was Victor Hugo, risen from the grave, eager to see what West End London hath wrought with his masterpiece.  Best of all, the entirety was recorded on Blu-ray with crisp, sharp video and audio.  I erased the tv version and gained my 280 minutes.  Without regret.  BECAUSE....<br /><br />Not only did I NOT have to convert dollars into pounds, cross the Atlantic Ocean, reserve a London hotel room, beg the concierge to scalp me some amphitheater tickets, hail a London taxi and tip people to see this historic event, I saw it in my own front row seat, at my own convenience, in my own living room.  A bargain?  No.  A  STEAL !!
B00D23K0MU|5.0|I'm not sure who it is who says MAYSA is boring and one key but you are dead wrong! MAYSA is the BEST...I repeat...BEST singer of this time (and definitely NOT a \\"less mushed mouth anita baker\\"). Her voice was described by jill scott as \\"velvet on a plate.\\" Her vocal abilities and EVER KEY CHANGING songs are SPECTACULAR! I first heard her with INCOGNITO and had no idea who she was, so I called the radio stations non-stop until I found out. I have EVERY SINGLE SONG with her voice on it...even songs not released in the USA. She NEVER EVER NEVER EVER disappoints. Take an honest listen to her body of work. Each cd gets more and more amazing! Each cd is DIFFERENT and her body of work is BREATH TAKING. BLUE VELVET SOUL and ALL of her work is ESSENTIAL to a REAL music lover's collection! Period. End of story.
0486274268|5.0|It a nice book for drawing animals step by step, and has perfect quality to draw.<br /><br />I recommend for those who wants to begin to draw animals for there first time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved the puzzle game. Wish there were more rooms. Very challenging. I couldn't wait to find out what would be in each successive room.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Pretty fun and doesn't require you to buy everything in order to play it! Keep my attention and takes care of itself when I'm away.
0374533571|4.0|I had never heard of this book before I saw the preview for the movie. I knew I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie and the book club I am in happened to be reading it for the month of June. The book was a great story and the characters really drew me in. I am not normally a fan of \\"first person\\" books but, the story and characters had me at the first line and I finished the book with in a matter of days because I didn't put it down. I would highly recommend this book who is looking for an intriguing story, a little bit of laughter and interesting characters.
B00BCK1A5G|5.0|Nalini Singh manages an intricate plot and manages to bring characters to life to the extent that you could really imagine the world portrayed in this series of books.  The nuggets that Ms Singh drops into the series to 'seed' future stories keep me intrigued and wanting more.<br /><br />As for this book - well its got what I am looking for in a romance -  hot bodies, ripper sex scenes and an intelligent plot line.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The problem with this book is that once you read book two, you ahve to read book three.  You can stop after book one and be satisfied, book two is awesome, but book three just seems like it gets tired at the end.  The last third is somewhat confusing in narration (departing from the artful narration of the rest of the series), and many things happen that aren't carefully explained or told in a mesmerizing way.  The plot overall is satisfactory, but this is one of those books that I hope come out with an &#34;extended cut&#34; to finish out the missing or incomplete parts of the story.  If you read two, read three, just don't expect the close of this story to pull you in like the rest of the series.
0744014549|5.0|The book has featured many artistic scene and the development of characters and weapons,<br />as concept artist, I recommended you to by this book
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|This was an okay movie, but overall not really a zombie movie.  Kind of corny, but that was what I was expecting.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Its not as action packed as the previews lead it on to be. However, it really opens your eyes to the struggles one faces with alcohol addiction. Great storyline and great acting.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This minor investment in a game that my children ages 7, 9 & 11 (boys and girls) still love after a year of playing. some games come and go but this is one that will stick around. The pocket edition is $7 compared to the full computer edition $27. My kids have played both editions and say that they prefer the full edition because their are more things you can do but they are still very happy with the cheaper pocket edition. It's pretty neat that they can log on with their friends & siblings virtually or side-by-side.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|I've only used a few times, it's to bad you can only use it as self portrait, otherwise I'd be taking pictures all the time. Make it to where you can aim and snap...
B00D6M86RS|1.0|Should have read the reviews before I purchased this app. It's a shame, sounds like a great game. What a waste.
B002PEP4C8|5.0|Almost right away you are aware of why the book is titled &#34;Lucky&#34;; yet the reader never really feels that she is lucky. I enjoyed her writing style and she kept me intrigued with what was going to happen next.
B0033CTKHG|1.0|Don't waste a penny on this .  This is one of the worst movies ever made. Save your dough for better flicks.

There was no American English language option.**
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I think that HP and the deathly hallows part 1 and part 2 are the two best movies out of all of the series.
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|I got this for my 3 year old grandson so he can keep himself busy when we are traveling in the car.

B00BRR66SA|5.0|My first JT albulm and I thought it was great Blue ocean floor is my Favorite track very mellow and chill
B00846REIS|5.0|Spoiler Alerts--<br /><br />I am absolutely obsessed with this series. It is such a hot read it always leaves you wanting more which is the same sentiment for Gideon and Eva. The sexual chemistry between these two could burn down a city. They are so hot for each other it almost makes you envious lol. What makes it so hot is these two understand  each other like no one else. Both had very traumatic childhoods which consisted of forced sexual encounters. While Eva is more open with Gideon telling him about her traumatizing experiences, Gideon cannot seem to open himself to her and tell her what his experience was. She knows it's bad because she has witnessed his nightmares first hand and the haunted look in his face when he finally is awakens from those nightmares. Her trust and love for him is strong though and have sticks by his side even when she is put to a test when some of the women from his past come into play.<br /><br />The one thing that did get to me was the pace of the story. Soo much is going on but when you read it, it's all within matter of weeks instead of months. I think that is the only thing that bothers me about the book other than that I love Gideon Cross<3
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is so amazing i love not to shabby games that are free thx g5 for this increadable game<br />Thanks.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|Action packed, blood and death in gory ways.  Special effects very well done. Plot there but action dominates this movie. Enjoyed the many outdoor scenes featuring supposed Russia b
B00D37UQ1K|5.0|There were things I missed a lot, yes, but I knew a lot would get lost in translation. I loved the way they tightened up the beginning, though, loved the way Saoirse Ronan managed to convey both Melanie and Wanderer as separate characters - especially as one wasn't a physical presence.<br /><br />Can't wait to watch again and again now I have my own copy of it.
B00BKBCF38|5.0|Have been waiting for this one ever since I have heard of Ghost BC.Not a bad track on the whole CD I love every one of them.If you are a fan of doom metal you will love this one, it's the best CD of 2013.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|I loved every part of this book. I was always interested and intrigued. My new favorite author, I would recommend it to anyone! So good!!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I do enjoy this game quite a bit, so I decided to get the Steam version of the game Scribblenauts Unlimited as well which is a more expanded version of this game.  I hope other games are made from this series soon.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|great way for me to pass the time while waiting at doctor appointments or on road trips. a must have.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I just love this show so much.  I'm no critic, but I think its smart and entertaining and I could watch it over and over.  Its just good!
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|This game starts out pretty easy and gets downright exciting and addictive. Myself, my 6 and 8 year olds play it every day.
B008JFUPFI|5.0|Ok so I loved the movie, I think for the most part the acting was great and the story was well done. Henry Cavill was amazing as Superman and most of the other actors were played well. The action in this movie is sick! I loved the fight scenes and how there was a ton of action.this is definitely a must see. Now I do have some things that I didn't like, but they weren't terrible enough to give a lesser rating and here it goes: SPOILER ALERT!!<br />Cons: I think Michael Shannon played Zod a bit weak. I expected a bit more of that tightly wound character that he plays so well. I almost felt bad that he was trying to &#34;save his people&#34; We are supposed to hate Zod not sympathize with him?<br />They way Jonathan Kent dies was a little too much, I mean it seemed to me like that was the slowest tornado EVER! Like really? It was like watching spongebob &#34;3 hours later&#34; for all my parents out there lol and then by the time the tornado actually engulfs him it's like No No son don't save me everyone will see?! Heck half the town already knew he was special &#34;my son was in the bus&#34;!!! Why not just save your dad? Seemed to me like they should've just let the tornado take him and cut out the whole not saving his father thing? Most of us wouldn't care who saw I think not if it meant saving a loved one?<br />And the final thing was as much as I loved the fight scenes it seemed like Metropolis was a barren wasteland after this and it was like absolutely destroyed,  and in my opinion it seems to me a lot of people would be pissed off a supes being that he was sorta the reason this all happened? Just saying... Besides that though its a fun comic book movie and deserves the five stars
B0026772N8|4.0|The art of motorcycle maintenance poses some philosophical questions which Robert M. Pirsig tries to answer in his Chautauqua, in this book, The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. With his twelve-year-old son Chris, he tours the United States on a motorcycle while talking about various philosophical problems, but mainly about the idea of Quality, the difference between the classical and romantic understanding of technology, and he even discusses Immanuel Kant's 'Critique of Pure Reason'.<br /><br />He does this with a clear understanding about where he wants the discussion to go. The idea of Quality is the main drive force behind the discussion, and it is thought-provoking and interesting at the same time. Quality, he thinks, is the essential necessity to building houses, and without it, you are just building with bricks, and not sensing the overall picture or idea of the house, which makes it look good. Quality is also an essential part of writing, and he comes up with an example in a classroom situation, where the students discusses quality in writing (to take just one example).<br /><br />In his Chautauqua, he also discusses questions like the difference between seeing the motorcycle in a classical way and seeing it in a romantic way. The classical way is concerned with the underlying structure of the motorcycle, the functions: if you do this to the motorcycle, it will do that and so on, whereas the romantic way concerns itself with the feeling of the motorcycle.<br /><br />If you want a philosophical book that is easier and more fun than the great classical philosophical books, you should read this book. It is an interesting and fun book that covers many of the problems that technology and the human interaction with technology can create.
B00622B3MY|4.0|Worked well first time.  Clolors and sound excellent.Great movie. No scratches. The case was fine.  the DVD was not damaged.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game. I love playing it. Super difficult though. I really didn't want to write this review but I am being force. I love the game.
B008133MDK|5.0|Season 2 is fantastic.  Smartly written.  Can't get enough, and would certainly recommend it to anyone. Keeps you engaged for every minute.  What a great show!
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|A good thriller...one that will keep you interested throughout the entire movie. I think you will be pleased with the plot.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|It is a good game a little glitchy some times and the game clock does not always keep pace with real time
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. It was so much fun trying to figure out everything that is needed to progress to the next level. I can't wait for more levels.

161655164X|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1KL1OT4EA2U93]]The Art of Last of Us is a wonderful art book to Naughty Dog's latest game. I also have the [[ASIN:1921002719 Uncharted 2 art book]] and I love that book. I love this one too.<br /><br />This book is packed with character designs and environment art. The concept art is top notch.<br /><br />All the characters and infected are drawn out in detail and colour. There are various designs for each character. Lots to see. The infected, if you have not played the game, are not traditional zombies. They have been infected by some deadly fungus that grows and consumes the human body. You get to see some interesting and scary designs that you would not get from typical zombies.<br /><br />The environment art are painted with astonishing amount of detail that makes everything seem so real. There are the devastated towns, rundown buildings, deserted streets and ransacked rooms. Most scenes depicted will make you wonder what the hell happened there. The level of realism you see here is unmatched even by big budget movie sets.<br /><br />Spoilers appear in the book either as text or pictures. So definitely play the game first before going through the book. Other than that, there's not much text except the occasional comments on the art and game.<br /><br />This is a fantastic video game art book. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Oh, play the game first if you can.<br /><br />(There are more pictures of the book on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)
B00BSTVEDE|5.0|A heavy weight superb quality pressing of my fave sci-fi film Bladerunner. So much<br />Nicer than a horrid CD. Analogue still has a place in,my world.

B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Daniel Day Lewis is an astonishing actor. For the first 30 or so minutes of the movie I was riveted by his performance. Unfortunately, the plot moves along pretty slowly and is sort of boring. It was worth watching to see Daniel Day Lewis though.

B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I started out with the mini armory by OriginalPlan and loved it so I bought the real version. I loved it except that it only had on grenade.

I thought it was great but I was expecting more weapons. it gives you 6-7 I cant remember. very entertaining. best gun app for kindle fire!
B009PNQUXO|4.0|This app is needed to download any movie clip from youtube. It is also easy to install and to use..

0399162097|5.0|An extremely entertaining and readable novel which rises to great literature with a shocking thump to the heart. What is the meaning of family?  Of love?  Fowler raises the most important of questions.  Beautifully executed.
B008I34Z8E|5.0|Excellent orchestral charts.<br />Inspired songs and the usual excellent musicianship.<br />I have the vinil since 73 and I needed a newer version to make it last 40 more years.
0385349947|5.0|This book is long overdue.  Recently, I heard a high school History teacher ask a class why more women didn't apply for administrative positions in education.  When I raised my hand and said that women are still primary childcare givers and that balancing career and family is a constant strain on a woman's ability to excel in a career, he told me I was wrong.<br /><br />The answer, he said was that there were not enough women applicants.<br /><br />As a woman, I felt his answer was ridiculous.  As a woman, I questioned myself and didn't challenge him.<br /><br />Ms. Sandberg's book helped me by reinforcing what my own personal experience has been and what other women have told me. I can't thank her enough!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Absolutely loved every part of this trilogy!!! Words cannot describe how I feel!!! I wish it could continue forever and ever!!
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|Once again Daft Punk is lighting up the charts! A must have song in summer of 2013. Go get'em Daft Punk !
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This is a very fun game with a lot of different things to do. It has great graphics. I think anyone would enjoy this game.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Loved this game! It is fun and more interactive than some other city or village building games. I definitely recommend this game.
B004JUTFH6|4.0|I discovered this french soul singer while watching the BBC live music show &#34;Later with Jools Holland&#34;.<br />The &#34;Seven Nation Army&#34; cover version is better than the original.<br />The songs in french however are less brilliant.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This is my grandson's absolute favorite game!  They love working their way up to the next size shark and can't wait to become the 'Great White'.  The graphics are incredible!  Don't hesitate to get this great app!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I found that some of the levels were difficult to find the solution with out lots of exploring. Don't like the fact you can only go to stage ten and that's it.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It is so nice to  reach for my Kindle and turn on Facebook, the Internet and also watch movies.  Fast response
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|The Ocean at the End of the Lane left me rather disappointed.  It seemed to be too short as though it just ended and that was that.  The story is interesting enough there are many hints about powerful forces as old as time... we experience some of them along with our story teller.  The family at the end of the lane are the keepers of ancient knowledge and we all know there is more to their story.  As other reviewers have stated, I am not sorry that I bought and read this book but I do not feel that this is not Neil Gaiman's best work.  I would have enjoyed more of this story but there was nothing much there even with such a rich idea.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love this game! It makes you think! The only part I do not like is having to remember things because my memory is really bad,which is not any fault of the game.
B004N62KTG|5.0|Well, i was having this EP, this one is the second i got, but i'm keeping this one sealed, thanks!, it was really fast!
B007LGPSX0|5.0|Loved this show for many, years, so glad it's online!  I spent a whole weekend on the first season! Love!
B002QRWJA4|5.0|Absolutely loved this movie. Great music, good acting, and devilishly charming. I especially loved how Gerard Butler played the phantom. Who new King Leonides could sing!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I found this book to be extremely valuable and insightful.  I understand me best friend better than I ever have as a result of reading this book.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use this for waking me up, taking medications, tv program reminders and a timer for various things. Love it!
B009O2XY12|5.0|Love to pop bubbles.  This isn't very challenging to me, but I like to pop the bubbles. So I'll continue playing this game, and have mindless fun!
0345529057|5.0|if you're looking for mysterious stories in a far away land, a song of ice and fire books is a must in your list!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Have played this Game for years on two platforms love the diversity of Dragons and their habitats. Always something new and fun.
B007N85POS|4.0|My 6 yr old daughter beat this before I did.  Now she is tackling bad piggies.  Would like to see updates for angry birds star wars.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|this includes the cd and dvd. so double the pleasure. these guys are so rich in their talent, they make their music look effortless. it flows flawlessly and is a joy to listen too and watch. treat yourself. i especiiallyove the video of pacheble's  canon.too funny
B005PK56TA|5.0|I'm hooked. I can't stop watching. I had no idea that &#34;AMERICAN STORY&#34;  was this captivating. I love it. Can not wait until the new series begin this fall 2013.
B00A757EFW|3.0|I use to play pac man when I was a teenager, this brings back memories.  I'm just not in to Pac Man anymore.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Please, for me, just read it. You won't be disappointed in the slightest. Of that I can guarantee you. Snorkel.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Pros:<br />* Mouse button trio on the side is well placed. I definitely use those while playing FPS games. This is a killer feature for me.<br />* Tracking is perfect. The mouse cursor would visibly skip over the screen with my previous mouse. This one is dead on.<br />* High quality switches. Hopefully I won't have a dead left-mouse button issue with this one in 1-2 years.<br />Cons:<br />* Doesn't quite fit my hand as well as the Cyber Snipa Stinger (the Anker is slightly larger). Sadly, they're discontinued or I would have bought a 3rd.<br />* The button just past the scroll wheel is a bit hard to reach and if you hit it wrong it can get stuck (hasn't happened while in-game yet though)<br />Other thoughts:<br />* Apart from the standard left/right/middle buttons, this mouse has 4 extra programmable buttons you can use without changing your grip<br />* Took me two days to acclimate myself to this mouse (i.e.: for precise FPS aiming)
B00CL1SR7O|5.0|Perfect for summertime this Album is packed with energetic beats and positive lyrics to lift up your mood for the day. Pop it in on a car ride to make morning traffic more bearable or pop it in on a drive to start your night of adventure. These songs not only made me want to dance and sing loud but it also gave me the feeling that &#34;anything is possible&#34; and &#34; forget your stresses&#34;. Full with catchy love songs and triumphant anthems this album is a truly the best yet of these four multi-talented young men.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great brain game! I did have to cheat a little.....I get frustrated easy, but only on level 9 and 10. Can't wait for more levels!!!
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|Great story-telling! An intricate tale of family, land, and what makes a meaningful life. The tapestry of characters makes the narrative somewhat difficult to follow.
B009G41CG2|5.0|I like to play the matching tile games.  Its fun to see if I can clear all the tiles.  My 6 year old great niece also likes to play this on my Ipad.
B00BFBSV72|5.0|This game is really great. Its not like Doodle Jump at all!! If you can get it you should. Its worth it.
B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|I initially was disappointed for buying this album, but it is growing on me.  I wish they would change their name to something else - I don't mind them making music but it really isn't quite the same and the name shouldn't be either.  I don't mind the new singer but he can't replace a one of a kind voice like Layne.  All in all it is okay but I think Black Gives Way To Blue was a bit better.
B000ZM1MGE|1.0|great movie but took forever to ship to me if you order this dont look forward to getting it any time soon but would recomed this movie its great
B008XG1X18|3.0|I have not used Pinterest yet on my Kindel nor have I have used Pinterest but I am sure once I get sucked into it I will be using it on my Kindel too
B008BU75IQ|4.0|We have read the three books out in the Clifton Chronicles and can't wait for the next one.  Archer ensures that readers come back for more with a cliff hanger at the end of each book.  Books are great summer reads-easy with no heavy lifting.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This was a great book, now i cant wait to see the movie. Fast read could not put the book down.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series is brilliant. I don't watch TV but was told by someone who knows my tastes that this series is smart, realistic, spell binding and pretty close to life in the UK for the aristocrats. Actually, having lived there it has not changed all that much! Love it!
B00BEXB18M|3.0|All the songs on this album have the same beat and the same tone, sounds the same to me.  I generally like about half the songs on the more recent albums but this one just doesn't have any that I had to have, wish I could return it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome but I really want an update to come Out because this update I<br />Have is getting boring because I have had the update for a really long time
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|Liked it<br />Easy to play. Lots of levels so you can play for a while.<br />Graphics are simple but clear.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|Love this intro album to Adele- wonderful mix of sound and lyrics with a interesting mix of rhythm and beats.
B003HARV3Y|4.0|Better movie the first time you watch. Still a good movie, but nothing rememberable other than Pierce Brosnan as a Centaur.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|so glad prime added season 3 as I wanted to watch again before the new season starts,,,,,love it more than the first time
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game it loved out once and I had this for years one bad side you have to be 30 feet away from the person but awesome buy it is not a wast if money so intense  at night so much mobs please buy it is nor a wast of money I promise you verry cool
B0083P1QUM|5.0|All of the Kay Scarpetta novels are great!  The cast of charecters have really evolved as time has gone by.  Book to book life has moved along with all involved.
B00CPTUNBK|1.0|I hate it and my sister loves it... I am 14 and really never got the point of the show... Mlp sucks
B004TI5N38|5.0|David Baldacci is a great writer,  He's an easy read and I love the way I can BOOKMARK and come right back to where I stopped.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|So addictive I can't put it down.  Really good to teach kids responsibilities.  Very realistic and extremely fun. A great game all around.
B005544V6A|5.0|Great characters and acting. Interesting story lines, fast paced, and funny. I would like a little more drama around personal lives intertwined...that's what gives the show a continuity.<br /><br />Out of all the lawyer theme  show I have tried, I only liked \\"The Good Wife\\" and \\"Suits\\".
B001EC2J0C|5.0|Brando is so wonderful in this role that he almost makes me accept the unacceptable (no plot spoilers here) and Vivienne Leigh is a brilliant foil.  All actors, for example Karl Malden and Kim Hunter, are at the top of their games.<br /><br />The DVD copy is good.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Fun game for all ages! Be sure to turn your in-app purchases off unless you want to get a hefty bill...
B00BSBXZDY|5.0|Awesome story line... Great voice acting... Brought out unique characters. I like how they took Santa Claus and gave him ink and made him a rough guy
B0025VLELQ|4.0|About a boy that plays a computer arcade game and he is the only kid in the galaxy that wins &completes the star fighter stage.but the game was put on earth by aliens who are looking for a star fighter2help them in war.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I Enjoyed the book and was surprised by the ending. This book made me think long after finishing the book
B001UGB1X8|4.0|Perhaps Tommy Lee Jones is a little old for the role, but he fulfills its parameters with conviction.  Good acting, great locations, convincing script.  I must read the book one day.
B0050Q3TDY|5.0|Jazzradio is excellent, just as simple as that. Can they improve? Sure. But happyness is brought to my ears thanks to them in a daily basis. And for free! Guys, I love you, and I am deeply grateful, thank you thank you thank you!!
B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|Little hard to keep up with for most people... Great acting, great effects... A little too close to &#34;The Fountain&#34; though
B000055Y0Y|4.0|Fast moving film.a very believable film. A trained hitman vs secret service agent.one is trained in the art of killing,the other is trained in the art of proventing it.malkovich is great as a bad guy.
030758836X|2.0|I must preface my review by saying I am picky about the books I read, especially fiction. I am losing my eyesight and am trying to write my second memoir. However, people who know that I love pychological mysteries highly recomended this book. I thought it interesting but wordy; yet I stuck with it. Yes, I was shocked at the twists but also felt a bit deceived. C'mon, this is beyond the beyonds as Frank McCort of \\"Angela's Ashes\\" wrote. Yet, his \\"memoir\\" was a bit out there in facts yet satisfying and this one really beyond belief and not at all satisfying. I gave it two stars because it kept my attention, though at times I was like  ---c'mon say what you mean to say.\\"  Yes, the end is terrible but what could have been a good ending to this fantasy? I must say it was a bit creepy and I liked that a bit. The writer is in love with words, her own and I wonder if she doesn't have a tad of Amazing Amy in her. That is not amazing
B007SNG6IC|5.0|All actors at the top of their game in this film.  Apparently a romance, this is more of a meditation on what it means to be human.  Beautiful.
B004JK61K0|4.0|Not pretty, not fancy, but useful, reliable, concise, clear, compact. I would like to see some style thrown into it, though... but I'm very happy with its seamless usability.
B0052BZ6X8|3.0|It's been done over and over and over and over..... exactly... Action was ok, wouldn't rent it again if I had the choice
B0068FZ0PG|5.0|Great I loved this film.I lost my father many years ago &this film hit the spot.if people wearnt around I mite of got emotional.lucky for me.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this is an awesome game! I just got it today and I'm already in love with it! I just wish it was easier to get diamonds... But I love horses anyway so asking as I get to play with the cute, little horses, I like like the game.<br /><br />  ~ M K P
B005Z28M58|5.0|I love this show.  I bought it so I could watch it again and again over the years.  I didn't want to rent it, I wanted to own it.
B000FCK8ZK|5.0|Once I got the book I just could not put it down. Never thought I can root for a serial killer. This book is a must read!
B00511ONPG|5.0|For those of you getting started in using social media to grow your business or those looking to expand your fan base, Likable Social Media is definitely worth a read. It gives great tips and pointers on using social media effectively to intrigue and interact with your fans in the correct way.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|One of the best films by denzil Washington.a few drug scenes.but worth watching about a strung out pilot who crashes a plane&is investigated
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Really happy that I no longer have to be tied to a tv or computer to play Duels.  My Kindle Fire HD 7\\" is handling it with no issues, and doesn't even heat up like I've felt it do on a lot of lesser games. My only real complaint is that they only included 10 challenges, of which only 5 even require any strategy.  The first 5 if they really felt they needed to include them should have been in a tutorial, NOT in the actual challenges section.  The Sealed Deck play is interesting, its not standard sealed, think more like a league style sealed deck, where you start with x packs, and by winning so many games, you can get more to increase the power of your deck.  I haven't yet checked to see if you can use normal limited construction rules regarding more than 4 of a card, I may update my review to include this information.<br /><br />Edit: 06/30/13<br /><br />The sealed deck indeed allows you to go over the 4 card limit, which of course is as it should.<br />I still haven't tried out the Bluetooth multiplayer, I'll do another update once I do.
B001VPJYZK|5.0|I love this show.  I bought it so I could watch it again and again over the years.  I didn't want to rent it, I wanted to own it.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|I loved this game and finished it in about an hour. when I got to the 8th level I wanted to play it all the time. please make more levels asap!
B00992CF6W|5.0|BUILD YOUR HOUSE, CRAFT, MINE, FIGHT, FARM, GET TOOLS, WEAPONS, ARMOUR, EVEN MORE!!!!!!!  Monsters come out at night!  Zombies, skeletons with bows, creepers that blow up, spiders and there is no blood!!! NOT VIOLENT!! AMAZING!!!!
B002T9H2LA|5.0|The English speaking bits were fantastic..great story  of  nazi Germany I really enjoyed it.make sure you can read English before you watch it so you can read subtitles.
B005PK57IK|5.0|love this show.  Once is started watching it , I couldn't stop.  Finished 4 seasons in less than 2 weeks. Can't wait for season 5
B003Y5HWGI|5.0|I love this show.  I bought it so I could watch it again and again over the years.  I didn't want to rent it, I wanted to own it.
0307730700|5.0|this is a well written book with a lot of good information on the negative aspects of drugs and the super people we have in the military
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Theres like no game similar to this one i have a kindle fire it works fine i give it 1000 stars
6305128952|2.0|When watching this movie I was waiting for something to happen but it dragged on..Every time the NEW YORK TIMES rates a show I should get ANOTHER OPINION.ok to watch with your mum.first 20min saved me from rating it 1 STAR.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I LOVE, LOVE , LOVE, LOVE IT! It is great for the collector and magazine clipper in me. Now I can find things right away.
B000FCK65W|5.0|This book really made me appreciate how good I have it.  In another sense, it makes me see how much we take for granted-the simple joys of life....making up and playing games outside with neighborhood friends instead of wasting time in front of a t.v. or computer screen.  I really saw aspects of my childhood while following the characters in this book.  I can't believe I had never heard of it before!
B008IBPMZG|5.0|Love the whole series. Reminds me a lot of Upstairs Downstairs that I watched when I was a kid in England.
B00785P2QC|3.0|It plays well but you get sucked into it just trying to keep your vehicles moving. Haven't been playing long but it does help pass the time.
B007EE4XKI|4.0|I enjoyed this Star Trek book.  Although I don't read many ST novels, I am a huge Trekker.  This story helped to fill in some gaps in the original story line.
B001C3L2C4|5.0|This is by far the best of Moody Blues albums. I can remember hearing it for the first time as a young teenager. I was absolutely \\"awe struck\\". For its time it was extremely innovative. The production was a marvel! It is almost on par with ELO's - Eldorado and, (you will gasp) Pink Floyd's - Dark Side of the Moon. All are concept albums. All were innovative. All had cutting edge production techniques. This is kind of a \\"forgotten\\" album. Check it out -best played loud, in a darkened room with a good audio system!
B00APUQKJK|1.0|This was terrible.  I can't believe Robert doesn't have any better scripts given to him to choose from.  What a waste of my money.  Very disappointed.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Well written and believable , this story was the experience of a Neurosurgeon's near death experience with the knowledge of how the brain works, convincing, and hopefully real.
B005S9EK5Y|3.0|SADDLY YOU COULD NOT SEE THIS MOVIE BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY TOO DARK.. They could have filmed it almost anywhere.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Exciting...playing mystery game that's just lighthearted and pure fun...can't stop...addictive...have to stop writing so I can get back to my rooms!!!
B003NRYMZQ|2.0|The weak storylines of first season of torchwood tried my patience.  I expected better from a &#34;Dr. Who&#34; spinoff.  Oddly enough it gets better as the series go on.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Work's good on Kindle fire. Just got it and was looking for some games and it has good graphics for the player.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game... finding codes and sequences in order to escape a room. My only issue is that it was only 10 rooms! Add more rooms soon!
B006GHA9QQ|2.0|So this movie was not able to be played by me, except as a preview on my laptop. If they don't give their customer options, they are going to lose business. I already stream on NetFlix, But I would like to be able to see current movies wirhout having to have them mailed.
B00455IVHU|4.0|This is a feel good movie in the vein of Moonstruck or Romancing the Stone.  A very enjoyable break from the stresses of real life.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|this is one of the smallest sharpeners ive ever had and one of the best next to my sharpening stones<br /> works best on bulky knives that are built to last and arent always the sharpest tool in the shed<br /><br />But even so you take a knife that is already sharp and dead;y this thing will make it cut air ha haaa
B007OWRBJK|5.0|Except now maybe we do!<br /><br />Who I Am is a comprehensive memoir starting with his earliest childhood memories of a troubled but still loving family life and how Pete's art school education heavily influenced early Who music and style and the direction of the band.<br /><br />He also talks about his battles with alcohol, drugs, relationships, fidelity, and his own sexuality, but the main focus is on his creative process. He is honest and open about his desires for ever-increasing financial payouts, recording studios, mansions and yachts.<br /><br />The book also sheds insights into relationships with bands like the Rolling Stones, The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Cream, and Jimi Hendrix Experience. The death of his own longtime friend and bandmate Keith Moon seemed glossed over, barely getting more than a few paragraphs.<br /><br />He does address in detail the controversial use of his credit card to register with a website advertising child pornography, which he claimed was research for his campaign against child pornography on the internet. Ultimately, the police cautioned him, but no charges were filed against him.<br /><br />Pete Townshend is a gifted, and sometimes troubled man. Who I Am shares, in great detail, both his personal and professional life. If you are a fan of The Who, Pete Townshend, or early rock and roll, Who I Am takes you backstage to the life of one of rock's most complicated icons.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book is a great read. Lots of action and adventure throughout, and overall it's just enjoyable to finish the series with this story.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It  begins easy and gradually gets harder, but never impossible.  Use common sense and you will minimize the amount of times you say, &quot;duh&quot;.
B009NZQDW2|4.0|An early Quentin Tarantino. Blood and violence easily recognizable today. The cast reads like a who's who of the genre, and Patricia Arquette turns in a great performance.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I have been a fan of Aurther Conan Doyle for almost 60 years. The stories never get old and I reread them constantly.  Now I have them on kindle. Perfect!
B00A0SICYI|5.0|My kids are like most kids today.  They love movies with explosions and language that really doesn't belong in a family film (admit it, you watch them too). Chitty Chitty Bang Bang wasn't just a welcome relief; it was good fun and my kids loved it!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|this app does a great job of bringing ww2 weapons back to modern life,so to me it is a great app
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Todd La Torre has stepped up to the plate and delivers some rocking music with the rest of the band. This CD really rocks.  The band is back to the old Queensryche as they were prior to Promised Land.  Not a bad song on it.<br /><br />Spread the word on this CD.  First day on the shelves, it was sold out before noon.  The band is dedicated and loyal to their fans.  You have to listen to this CD!
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Great mental exercise. Enjoyable for all ages! Very challenging at times, easy a t other times. Competitive with one's own brain.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|Good game but makes no sense no directions . It's a ripe off even for no money don't buy it do not buy it. Don't tell me I didn't warn you and you can't escape do not buy do not buy it<br /><br />Do not buy it
B006RZZ9YY|5.0|This movie is about family and accepting those who are different just for who they are.  Think the Ugly Duckling meets the Fifth Element and you'll have the basic idea.  Beautiful film. About as close as Disney will ever get to a Ghibli movie.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Its one of those games where the graphics are not that great but its sooo addictive to play you won't put it down. It takes a few tries to get into the flow of things but when you do, you can't stop.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|You can create a giant yeti you have to make a nice one for it to not attack also you can make golems
B00BRUYQFC|2.0|This album is awful.  There's really no other way to say it.  I don't even know where to begin with this review.  It's like Justin is trying way too hard to be different and be unique with this album, rather than putting out well rounded music, suitable to his style.<br /><br />We've seen this before.  An artist or band that has a ton of success under the belts try to deviate far away from what made them successful in the first place.  And I understand why artists do it.  As a creative human being, you try to reach new heights.  You try to re-invent yourself.  You try to add another dimension to your craft.  But 9 times out of 10, it doesn't work.  And quite often, it's a disaster.  I wouldn't necessarily call this album a disaster, per se.  But, it's just flat out terrible.<br /><br />We all know Justin Timerlake can act; and he can sell the hell out of the characters he plays, but he can't sell me on this experimental music.  The music sounds forced, jumbled, and half the time, it doesn't even sound like he knew where he was going with the particular song or rhythm.  It's just a complete mess.  There are a few moments of positive vibes on the record, but the highs are few and far between the many, many lows.  TKO is far and away the best song on the album.<br /><br />Just a quick FYI, on sites like this, when you see a 1 sentence, 5-star review on a music album, a good portion of the time, it's the record company writing a phony review to artificially boost the ratings.  This is fact.  Don't pay attention to the ton of 5-star reviews this album got.  Just read through them.  Many of them are 1 sentence long, and it's the only review that person ever wrote. Prototypical fake review, that was placed by the record company. When you read the 3, 2, 1 star reviews, you see intelligent, well written reviews, that generally echo the thoughts that most have on the album.  That's not to say ALL of the 5-star reviews are fake, but many of them are.  Check it out of yourself.  Knowledge is power!<br /><br />Sorry to those who might disagree with my take on the album, but this my 20/20 Experience was a complete bust.Knowledge is power!<br /><br />Sorry to those who might disagree with my take on the album, but this my 20/20 Experience was a complete bust.
0062014102|5.0|I definitely recommed this book.  It was a fun read and eye-opening.  It's no surprise to see the number of positive reviews for this text.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I do not use Facebook and tried to get rid of the app. Unfortunaely, I was told that I could not get rid of it. What is Facebook paying Amazon to keep the app on the Kindle?
B008PZYZH6|4.0|It's a fun action-adventure type movie.  I am a fan of all the main actors and just had to check it out.  W. H. Macy is, as always, awesome!  I really liked it.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I cant get any of the seeds to work. Every world looks the same with the different seeds. I cant seem to find any of the chests.

B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|I could not put this down. This was probably the sixth or seventh Jack Reacher book I have read, and it makes me want to read every single one! I hope Lee Child has a lot more coming.
B00DGI1Y08|4.0|This is probably a welcomed departure from the last few albums if you're a fan of the fun, stage-y side of Hanson. It's rock & roll in the vein of Shout it Out, but personally, I don't think it has the same heart. This is the first Hanson record since Underneath I haven't just adored, and after a week of listening to it, I doubt it's going to grow on me the same way.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Amazing concert video. The only thing better would have been being there live. It is not a full musical, but the actors all sing their parts and still enteract on stage with each other. The lighting and background screens are incredible. The full choir backing up the actors is also awesome.
B00CVCG87O|5.0|The fact that this album has topped several music charts gives me hope that music isn't dead, and real musicianship is still appreciated.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Awesome. I love this game even though I'm a girl.There's nothing wrong with that BOYS,this game is also for girls!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Absolutely love this game. Perfect amount of difficulty. Couldn't put it down!  Don't. want to wait for more rooms but I will be anxiously looking for them!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game was awesome!!!! It was very challenging...I'm going to get the next one right away!!! Would recommend to everyone who loves this type of game
B003UESJHY|5.0|This is a true story, and there isn't a bad performance in the film.  It's easy to see why Christian Bale and Melissa Leo won Academy Awards.  Mark Wahlberg's best film too.
B000EHNEDO|4.0|This movie was great when i was younger, it made me want to buy it to watch it again.  It was good the second time around too.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This is a good hidden objects game. I like the fact that it is more than than the usual find an object game. I love mysteries, so, this is perfect for me.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Action packed dark fun. I look forward to coming home and watching an episode each night. I'm on episode 8.  If you liked Rome, and you play SykRim, you we love this series.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Amazing computer animation, and a really original story.  Well thought out storyline.  It was in danger of being a little long, but had an excellent finish.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|This is a good holiday read, the book is well written with a quirky storyline, it was hard to put down , which is a compliment . Highly recommend this for a really enjoyable read
0062119044|5.0|This is another one of those books that can be very difficult to navigate, or to even \\"get into.\\" I had to attempt to read it one or two times before I finally forced myself into it. Even then, it probably took about a quarter of the book to really get me enthralled and almost...obsessed?<br /><br />Lionel Shriver has a beautiful way with words. I would say that I prefer books with more dialect rather than description, but the way this author tells the story of Kevin and his family completely sets the stage for the ending of the book. I have never read any other Lionel Shriver books, but I plan to considering how much I enjoyed this one. This book is a very emotional read. It's a sad look at what a family could be like and the not-so-fun parts of child rearing and relationships.<br /><br />Read the book. You will still be thinking about it months after! Oh, and then rent the movie because it's actually done pretty well, considering most movies don't seem to compare to books!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Slow to start.  I was 50% through the book and wondered if the plot was going to &#34;thicken&#34; and boy did it!!!!  Really enjoyed the book!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is one book where I think (at least for me), the less I knew before-hand about the story the better. This way, every reveal of information was exciting and interesting.
B0058YPL66|5.0|My daughter loves this series and me as well, they did a great way of merging all the fary tales together with a lot of twist and turns that will have you wanting more...
B009R659L8|4.0|Good but not up to her usual standards. It seemed to jump around a lot.  Still enjoyable for a good read
B000QCTNIW|5.0|This book is a good reading and educational.  It is down to earth enough written and is amazing.  You learn about what is possible with the brain and there are many possibilities.  Surprisingly made the blind able to see for one example.
B00884GR0W|5.0|I love the game. You can do quest and earn skill points!I prefer to upgrade your sword damage. My bare hand does 120 damage! I have full Dragon scale armor! I have 2 my precious rings. I have the spirit necklace and I use the Dragon shield. My pet Dragon is a level 20! And I have a huge wheat farm. My house is a big tree house with a swimming pool and a melon farm! I already killed all the bosses and have all the pets. I have explored the depths of hell and flew to the skylands. I have 830 hits on my angelic swords. I guarantee that u will love this game.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Dont get me wrong i love the trilogy, is just that in this blu-ray there is no special features and that is why am giving it a 1 out of 5. They want to push the consumer to buy the expensive 6 volume saga and there you will find the special features, but those of us that cant afford it are stuck with this...<br />I don't recommend this product if your a hardcore fan.
B005DJREJS|5.0|So, my feelings on this show are kind if condradicting. I love it, and there is a sad truth in almost all of the situations that accur, however, I believe that this show should be for at least college level people, not children of high school. If a 25 year old adult can both relate and enjoy this program there is seariously something wrong with society today.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This is one of the best apps you can have on a Kindle- or other tablet. Before I got the ES File Explorer, I'd download files and have to hunt for them. Then I got the ES File Explorer and it is totally easy to find my downloads. Whether it's an eBook, game, program, whatever. The E File Explorer organizes them into appropriate folders. Also, when connected to my computer, I'm able to transfer eBooks and manuals(from) my computer, I can transfer my manuals for programs I have (and am learning) on my computer- making learning those programs easier to learn since I can look at the Kindle, separately. I LOVE IT!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great read.  Really had difficulty putting it down because it was so compelling.  Have added it to my &#34;books to be read again&#34; list.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|AWESOME!!!!! buy it for the special features and for the movie as well. If you dont have a dvd player give the dvd to some one that has like your cousin. There's no need for it...
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I look forward to more rooms being added. If the difficulty continues to progress it will be a really good game.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This game is the best game ever because I love world war 2 and there is WW2 guns. There is the Thomson,the M 1grand
B0030B624E|5.0|The movie itself is a little on the gory side, but the writers take the growing fad of the zombie apocalypse and reshape it as a comedic chase for love and family. The moral of the movie is perfectly tossed in with the action and comedy.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|One of my favorite movies twicked in the neatest way.love the special affects vividly Color and music. Will be watching it again.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Those were the days when great movies were made.  It is so funny.  Wish they would make movies like this now.  Maybe the writers need to watch this and get back to making movies worth watching.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|It as an absolutely fun game for mahjong lovers.  I always play before I go to bed at night and end up playing for hours!
B00AEBB9SM|5.0|Proverbial question of does art imitate life or does life imitate art? Watch it and determine for yourself! Very entertaining as well as thought provoking.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun and look forward to more levels. help screen would be good to help when you get stuck.  hurry with the new levels.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|:Fun logic game. Great relaxation for the brain. Different puzzles than I have seen before. Hope there are endless levels.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|Most unique zombie movie ever--with so much heart! Genre defying, wonderful. If someone had tried to pull me away in the middle of this film, I would have bitten them.
B005HEXQN2|5.0|One of the most interesting aspects of this series is its emphasis on isolation: the crew is lost a virtually unimaginable distance from home, obsessed (and reasonably so) with the simplest of goals: getting back. This pervasive undercurrent of aloneness, and the black-and-white stay-or-go mentality that the various characters grapple with, have made this series noteworthy for its exploration of the psychology of human existence within a microcosm of community amid a near-endless expanse of otherness.<br /><br />I'm reviewing because I want to express how pleased I was with the way that this series wrapped up. It left no loose strings of any consequence, and the production team resolved long-running plot lines with aplomb. As the end drew nigh, the primary subplots completed their arcs in a satisfying, sensible way that left me feeling pleasantly satisfied that everyone was getting what they wanted--and deserved--in a believable, I-can-relate-to-the-characters'-motivations kind of way. When the final episode came (and then went), I was left with a genuine feeling of not just satisfactory, but downright satisfying, closure on the series as a whole.<br /><br />A moment on some details. Not all the episodes ooze brilliance; in fact, some are tedious. Others are complex, elegant, engaging, and thought-provoking. I wish the series (and season 7) were more consistent in their quality--or at least the degree to which I found them engaging--but the vast majority of the episodes that Star Trek: Voyager comprises were at least entertaining, and at best masterful. On a scale that maxes out based on realism rather than idealism, the flaws in this show are too insignificant to keep me from giving it five stars overall.<br /><br />Now a microdetail. Want a great sound bite? Check out season 7, episode 20 (\\"Friendship One\\"), at about the 12:32 mark: an ingenious expression of what the core of leadership really is.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Wonderfully written. I wanted to join her on the Pacific Trial after reading this! You will too! Highly recommend this.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Defending Jacob was a different read. I liked the ending being up in the air. It's a good book club discussion.
161655164X|5.0|First. I would like to confirm that this is the same book that comes with the Survival Edition of The Last of Us.<br />Second. If anyone is interested in a more in depth and hands on review of this amazing art book, I have a 6 minute video review (1080p) of The Art of The Last of Us on my YouTube Channel.<br />Channel name is, NiZZULiVE.<br /><br />Taken from my video review- \\"For those who are a fan of this game or game related art and development in general, I think it would be in your best interest to pick this up. This book has some of the most impressive concept art and illustration I've ever seen.\\"
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It is so interesting to see the thinking of the upper class  people at the same time they interact with their many employees.  Only the clothing and accent and demeanor seem to help you tell them apart sometimes.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Awesome love story! Great read for someone who normally doesn't read. Could not put it down! Ready for the next book!
006097625X|5.0|I love Scott McCloud! Changed my way of seeing and thinking as a designer. The book also came in great condition.
B00D6BQG1W|3.0|Was a good movie the definition of the picture was incredible. But the movie was hardly one you would watch more than once
B0002HZ70O|4.0|Very nice kit.  I especially like the dual decal option so that it can be configured correctly for the time period.  Parts casting is excellent and the instructions sufficient for even a novice modeler.  A worthy addition to any &#34;Great War&#34; aero collection.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this app! For all my bronies and pegasisters out there, this app is for you! The only problem with this app is for a month or two it wouldn't load when they added the Canterlot train special because the first time when it started to load the upgrade, I thought it was safe to get off the app to play another one! Boy, did I learn my lesson! So maybe it was my fault...(Changes rating from 4 stars to 5) I love this app!!!!!
B00C9VFWP6|5.0|While the Alive in Athens live collection is perhaps a bit better, this live recording does an excellent job showcasing both the band's skills and Stu Block's excellent vocals.
B00932A4XE|3.0|I was very reluctant to watch this, but nonetheless, my significant other forced me to. The movie had some really funny parts to it. But this movie was just too long, and I really just wanted to fall asleep. I'm glad I had a second bottle of wine on-hand.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|Avast! is a great mobile security software.  I have it on my computer, my laptop, my tablet and my phone.  It checks it before I even think to ask it to update and it scans every time I turn the item on.  This is a VERY good product.
B00AWQEKIK|5.0|This 4 CD set shows the influence of Stephen Stills as a primary style setter for the successful music projects he has been involved in throughout his career. If you like this recording, I also suggest Super Sessions. Stephen has played with the best musicians out there, yet he is distinct and maintains his &#34;one of a kind&#34; sound that separates him from the average musician.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|Discovered this series mid-way through season two. Had to see how it began. Have since purchased Season two set. Can't wait to see new episodes. Gina Torres is wonderful!
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|Best album I've purchased in a long time.  On heavy rotation in my car.  Love QOTSA, love Josh Homme and all his various projects.  This album is superb and striking, I feel like Homme is conjuring Bowie.  Ten bucks well spent (not a lot of liner art, which was disappointing, but the album totally makes up for it).
B004LZFWJO|5.0|Great game and fun to play.  It is keeping my mind fresh and quick.  Would recommend it to every age.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|i blew thru the game but took 2 hours to challenging i recommend it to any body who likes it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game. At first I ordered this game for my children. But after trying it myself, I'm hooked. I love it, it keeps you wanting more. You think I know I'll make it farther the next time....lol
B00COGXX7A|1.0|Really cheesy movie. I rented it in HD and the quality SUCKED it was totally blurry and extremely dissapointing. Dont bother.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|The leather rotating stand is great and has &#34;saved&#34; my kindle from several &#34;drops&#34;!  This was a lot cheaper than its competitors.  The only drawback is the location of the plug-ins to charge the Kindle, otherwise this is the one to buy!
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|Delightful movie in every way.  The whole family can enjoy this excellent movie.  It has humor and excitement and suburb acting.
B004G600A4|5.0|What a darling movie!  Rapunzel is so modern and fun to watch!  My granddaughter loved the movie and the characters and has watched it over and over again.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|This movie had my crying. I love that it is so true to this generation of parents and kids. This was one movie I would watch over and over again.
B00821PCJS|5.0|This is one of the toughest genres for a TV series to undertake.  As a movie, this type of post-apocalyptic show would be easy to execute, fitting a story line nicely into 90 - 120 minutes.  As a TV series, you have to keep the motion of the story line moving along for hours on end.  In addition to keeping the story line moving along, you have to maintain a certain degree of realism for the situation.<br /><br />I believe that Falling Skies achieves these qualities satisfactorily.  While my mind occasionally does ponder the obvious contradictions (90% of the people, including the military, have been wiped out, but these rag tag fighters aren't destroyed in the same fashion), I still find the story line intriguing enough to overlook these technicalities.<br /><br />Overall, this series holds its own against any other shows in this genre, and continues to gain traction with new viewers.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Our book club ALL liked this book, which seldom happens.  We include a review of the cover in our discussions....we thought the cover not nearly as representative of the book as the title.  I know the author doesn't usually have any/much say over the cover, but we all agreed that whoever came up with it (as well as the other cover used) did the book no favors.  It is not an eye catching cover that would help sell this wonderful story.  This sad tale is uplifted and unique by the influence of the flowers on Victoria's life.  I love gardening and flowers and had never heard that each flower has a meaning...what fun.  My only complaint would be the ending was not realistic.  But I loved it because the ending was not realistic.  I will opt for a warm fuzzy/feel good over realism any time.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|The music is most certainly AIC regardless of what the naysayers vomit forth, the price is unbelievable at less than $4 for the cd AND mp3 download with my Prime account...particularly when you consider that Amazon has the mp3 album listed at $5?!?! If any decision you make can be called a no-brainer making this purchase is that in spades!!!
B0090EKRKU|5.0|Fun movie for kids and adults alike.  Also the Amazon instant feature works tremendously without a single hiccup.  We actually watched it twice in the 48 hour rental period and both times the family was satisfied.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I chose this rating because it something special that everyone can use. Think who ever wants to know more about what words mean then they should have a Dictionary.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Descriptive info makes characters come alive. Plot twists keep reader engaged and wondering what will happen next. Couldn't put it down!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Surprise ending didn't see it coming<br />Couldn't put it down<br />Great book can't wait to read next one of the series
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Addicting show. Once you start you won't want to stop.  Can't wait to watch season two, three and get caught up in season four!
B000JMKQX0|2.0|***MINOR SPOILAGE FOLLOWS***<br /><br />The zombie apocalypse is very big in my office. Cubicles are adorned with Official Zombie Hunting Licenses and bumper stickers proclaiming the owner as part of a Zombie Response Team. Most zombie apocalypse fans in my office are guys in their 30's and are followers of The Walking Dead TV series.  Now, I tried The Walking Dead and soon found myself, more often than not, wondering when the show is going to be over.<br /><br />I take a backseat to no one when it comes to my horror fan bone fides. But horror to me means light, shade, dread, mystery and creepiness. It means more of what is unseen than is seen. Yes, I'm a big fan of the zombie apocalypse Ur-text Night of The Living Dead and, more recently, well made movies like 28 Days Later. In the main, though, zombie story telling in the 21st century leaves me yawning. More often than not the tale of the zombie apocalypse devolves into one of the avaricious bitchiness of the survivors. Unfortunately, Max Brooks' World War Z falls into this trap.<br /><br />I've tacked on an extra star here, as I sometimes do for reasons that have nothing to do with the content of the book. I think an oral history of a global war against the zombie hordes is pretty original and fresh.  I always like unique ways at looking at well-worn themes, a la Let the Right One In and vampirism.<br /><br />The book is organized into chapters which contain interviews the narrator, a UN official, conducted with survivors of World War Z, when the dead returned to life and obliterated the human population. Not surprisingly, I enjoyed the first part of the book the most, in which most of the world is in the dark as to what is happening. In these opening chapters, its these whispered rumors of dark, violent happenings around the globe and the building of dread that appeal most to my old school horror sensibilities.<br /><br />That dam bursts soon enough and the citizens of the world find themselves overwhelmed by the walking dead, who number in the millions and can only be killed by the infliction of massive brain trauma. Civilization reduces itself to defensible safe zones, leaving anyone who can't get to one of these enclaves to fend for themselves.<br /><br />The best interviews of the book are those that tell of individual struggles for survival, alone in the midst of a sea of chomping, smelly undead. Typical of these is the story of a reclusive twenty something internet addict in Japan who doesn't realize his parents have succumbed to the zombies until his mother fails to deliver breakfast a couple days in a row. Awareness of the world outside, social skills and musculature atrophied from countless hours spent in front of the computer, he summons the fortitude to fight his way out of his zombie infested apartment building. He eventually joins an elderly blind survivor of Hiroshima who uses some very Zen/Jedi techniques to survive months alone in the wilds of Hokkaido.<br /><br />Alas, unfortunately, these interviews are in the minority. The majority of the book consists of characters who provided leadership during the crisis or who actually fought the war. It's in these somewhat whiny chapters that the book pretty much flops.<br /><br />I'm surmising Max Brooks hasn't read many recollections of people who have experienced combat. In the oral histories of war I've read, the combatants are almost without fail humble, reticent to talk about their personal experiences and more likely to heap praise on those whom they served with than to highlight their contributions to the cause.  The general tone of Brooks' warriors is one of , \\"war is hell and no one had it worse than me.\\" While extolling their own personal sacrifices, the zombie killers miss no opportunity to impugn their comrades- in -arms from other countries and in other services. The sailor speaks of \\"army pukes\\"; the soldier of \\"intel pukes\\".  No one is immune from scorn and criticism. Generals LeMay and MacArthur andAdmiral Halsey (you know, the guys who actual won a real world war) are, at one point, called egomaniacal nut jobs.<br /><br />One gets the feeling that Brooks wants to portray the survivors in his book as heroic heirs to the Greatest Generation. What they come off as is typical denizens of the 21st century world, whose strongest instinct is to jump up and down and scream \\"look at me, look at me!\\" That humanity was almost wiped out in World War Z is not surprising, what with these folks as its defenders. This supposedly savage, apocalyptic struggle is, after all, against an enemy that whose sole strategy is finding its next meal, who moves no quicker than a shamble and whose primary weapon is a set of teeth.  The US military, the greatest fighting force in the history of the planet, is unable to defeat the shuffling undead in the Battle of Yonkers (yet somehow the Russians are able to manage using World War II surplus gear).  It doesn't come as a surprise that, in a world where everyone is a special individual and where awards and trophies are given for just showing up, that the characters in this book view their eventual victory over such an underwhelming (though, granted, numerous) enemy as a singularly heroic triumph.<br /><br />When World War Z goes big picture, it gets preachy. Not much real estate in the book is given to the precise cause of this zombie Armageddon. Instead Brooks, as subtle as sledgehammer blow to the nether regions, blames the apocalypse on the accumulated sins of current society, intimating that corporate greed, consumerism, the distance that's grown from our recent agricultural and manufacturing past and corrupt politicos are to blame for the catastrophe. The presidents, congressmen, military high command and various execs and boards of directors are all to blame for the current predicament. I started wondering when I stumbled out of World War Z and into an Occupy Wall Street camp after the 2008 financial meltdown. In World War Z world, asis the case in this world, few men miss an opportunity to blame someone else for their misfortunes, usually with the idea that recompense should follow.<br /><br />And as if to put an exclamation point on the entire sermon, near the end of the book a character laments that the biggest losers were the whales. Yes, the whales and not the hundreds of millions of people who died in the apocalypse.<br /><br />As far as the writing itself, nearly all the interviewees speak in the same voice. As mentioned above, the more personal the anecdote, the more successful the chapter. I could not help cringing at Brooks' attempts to make his warriors more authentically bad ass by introducing jargon. Loners who had survived outside the safe zone are called \\"Robinson Crusoe's\\". Combat divers in the Paris catacombs are \\"Cousteau's\\".  I wince just writing that.  And, while I'm not one keep a tally as to wrongs and slights committed by either side in the war of the sexes, I did find it noticeably odd how little a role women played in this victory over the undead.<br /><br />But then, I shouldn't be surprised, given this is a book written by a 30-something guy for 30-something guys.<br /><br />Probably the most damning criticism of this book is that, after reading it for ten minutes in bed every night, I felt ready for sleep. The \\"horror\\" in this book was no scarier than dealing with a horde of kids at Chuck E Cheese (who, when you think about it, have a lot in common Brooks' zombies...what with their singularity of purpose, numbers and arsenal) on a Saturday afternoon. That compares miserably with something like Pet Semetary, which I would put down at night and  lay awake, not wanting to turn the light off.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game was fun and challenging for me to complete. it will test your skills of how.smart you are. you should get this app right now
B0044DEAUA|2.0|I'm with the other people who are irritated that (1) the phone doesn't unpair from the device even when the car is 30 feet away and (2) if it does by some chance disconnect it can't easily reconnect.  Sometimes I have to turn my phone off and on.  The device worked well for a few months but now I'm feeling cheated.  Think twice before you buy this - yes, it may be less expensive than some others but ultimately it is a waste of $.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I am fan of Star Wars, Star Trek & Battlestar Gallactica. I find Firefly very engaging, entertaining and realistic, in a more realistic and futuristic setting. Extreme efforts have been put into getting all the details right. This is a show is addictive and totally deserves to get renewed for multiple seasons, unfortunately, that didn't happen though.<br /><br />EDIT: This is the best show ever made, I am a official devoted BROWNCOAT now !!!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Nice app being free helped. I like the large icon showing my battery and the charge it has. Thanks for a great app. The colors are nice.
B006BAEQB2|3.0|An avid reader knows how Gregory presents her stories. This novel is no different. It's about the 2 daughters of Warwick. It follows their involvement in the history of the English throne.
B0049J3QAY|5.0|If you haven't seen it, you should.  I consider this Pixar's best film, which says volumes.  The plot is fun for kids or older audiences (I've seen it as both now), and the animation is top notch.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|My husband and I really enjoyed this series because of it's clean nature and the lessons it teaches.  It's great for the whole family.
B002ZB26AO|4.0|Barbara Demick had me engaged from the first page to the last. I can't wait to read more about North Korea.
1594204217|3.0|This book was different from what I thought it would be.  It is a thorough academic history of food and how we are affected by its history and its now.  Lengthy!!!!!!!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Good look, easy to use... Looks great on the zoom and gives a constant reading of power remaining on my battery.
B000VDDDY6|3.0|Why would an American series like Star Trek only have French and Spanish subtitles, but not English. Star Trek took me back ,but amazons description included the English subtitles, and the disappointment of the set not having English subtitles ruined it for me, and as I am hearing impaired, subtitles are a must.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|kept thinking about this movie the next day - the kind that stays with you.  Feel like you know the characters, and you miss them when it's over :)
B000SEJHRA|5.0|David Sedaris` humor is light hearted and easily relatable. This is a great account of the amusing parts of his life.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun,  challenging game.  It keeps you guessing all office the time.  I am really enjoying playing and figuring out the clues! &quot;

B0041KBWM0|5.0|I loved &#34;Emma&#34; the first time I saw it and couldn't wait to see it again.  Johnny Lee Miller is one of my favorites and love him in this role.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|A really good movie, I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could.  Super acting and very engaging plot. My teen and I really enjoyed it.
B000F8O35U|4.0|The DVD set was purchased for a 4 year old who wanted the movie and is currently very into Princesses and Ariel in patricular.  I have not seen her since her birthday, but am sure the dvd is getting a lot of play.<br />An indication of how much she likes Ariel.  One of her other gifts was a set of Little Mermaid bath toys.  She, and her twin brother, was asking her mother if she could go to bed early (because that meant a bath before bedtime). Thanks for the speedy delivery.
B00BF123WG|3.0|The only thing missing from this was Claire Dane's cry face. I would recommend Homeland if you want a thriller about terrorism, or Charlie Wilson;s War if you want a good political story, or a book if you want to know what actually happened.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|The actual movie was very good.  Both my husband and I really enjoyed it.  This was the first on demand movie we had ever rented and it took a while to stream correctly.  At first it was pausing about every couple minutes or so.  After about twenty minutes, we had no further problems.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I bought this to play Star Wars The Old Republic. Makes two hand play easier and no internet log outs do to miss hit.
B00A9C3RNQ|4.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Rating: 4.5 out of 5.0<br /><br /> I had high hopes for 'Hope Springs' and was not disappointed, as it was directed by David Frankel, responsible for the excellent 'Devil Wears Prada'. How can you go wrong with icons such as Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones who have great chemistry together as Kay and Arnold Soames, a middle-aged couple, who have lost the spark in their marriage?<br /><br />The film proceeds methodically and with great subtlety as the stultifying relationship between the couple is stripped away during marriage counseling sessions with Dr. Bernie Feld (here Steve Carell does an excellent job playing a 'straight man', in a rare non-comedy role).<br /><br />When we're first introduced to the 'ordinary world' of Kay and Arnold, most people who have been married for a long time, will see quite a bit of themselves in this relationship. Arnold (a partner in an Omaha accounting firm) has alienated his wife through his curmudgeonly ways--watching golf on TV all the time and showing her zero affection. The most exciting thing that Kay reveals to her adult children, who are visiting for the holidays, is that they've just purchased a new cable TV subscription.<br /><br />The inciting incident occurs when Kay dips into her savings and purchases a one week getaway in Maine, to see Dr. Feld for \\"intense\\" marriage counseling. Arnold thinks it's a ridiculous idea and Kay announces she's going anyway, whether Arnold decides to go or not. The fact that Arnold joins her on the trip despite his earlier opposition, is significant, as it indicates that he's not completely hopeless.<br /><br />As we break into Act II, Kay and Arnold begin having counseling sessions with Dr. Feld. Arnold's resistance to therapy is quite strong in the beginning but they do have a breakthrough when they're able to hug one another in bed (this is Dr. Feld's 'sexercise #1'). The stakes are raised when he begins asking pointed questions about their sex life. Kay is so inhibited that she admits that she's had no sexual fantasies during the life of their marriage. The minor 'victory' of cuddling in bed is short-lived, as we arrive at the 'mid-point' with Arnold storming out of a session after he fails to take responsibility for sabotaging Dr. Feld's 'Sexercise #2' (touching one another sexually, in bed).<br /><br />What Arnold actually doesn't like is being exposed as a hypocrite, self-righteously asserting that he made all these sacrifices for Kay (such as never cheating on her, as this was some kind of badge of honor). In reality, he can't own up to the fact that he's withdrawn all affection for his wife and almost has completely sabotaged their relationship.<br /><br />The second half of Act II, reveals a series of obstacles that crop up, seemingly preventing the couple from achieving intimacy. First is the frank discussion that Kay and Arnold have about what they don't like about one another. Dr. Feld then asks them to have an intimate encounter in a public place (his request ends disastrously as Kay tries to give Arnold oral sex, in a movie theater).<br /><br />Finally, the therapy appears to be working, as Arnold's attitude appears to be changing. He manages to book dinner and an overnight stay at a fancy inn/restaurant in town (instead of the Econolodge, where they've been staying outside, on the outskirts of town). They both drink and retire to the bedroom, where they begin to make love. The second act crisis is brilliantly depicted, as Arnold won't look in Kay's eyes while about to make love, and appears to abandon interest. Kay is shattered over Arnold's indifference, which she believed, he had overcome.<br /><br />Dr. Feld likens the failure to consummate, like \\"fumbling\\" on the first yard line. He argues that when they first came in, they were merely in the parking lot, before going into the stadium. But Feld's words are of little consolation to the couple, especially Kay, who believes her goalto re-establish intimacy, has failed.<br /><br />But Dr. Feld was right all along. When you strip everything away, and the true emotions rise to the surface, eventually the damage will be repaired. So Arnold finally does have an epiphany and returns to the bedroom with Kay. The 'coda' at the end, where the couple renews their vows, is tantamount to the knight reclaiming a lost sword, after a mythic 'trial by fire' journey.<br /><br />Kay and Arnold are generic characters, and we only get to see a little of their back stories during the film. This isn't important, since we should be more interested in viewing the dissection of their relationship, through the film's narrative. One could argue that the film's scenarist, could have done more with the Dr. Feld character, as he seems to be too much of a 'perfect' therapist, but I'm sure there are those couples out there, who have undergone this kind of therapy, who will swear by therapists such as Dr. Feld.<br /><br />'Hope Springs' is more dialogue based, than an image based film. But due to the riveting performances of the principals, one's interest remains riveted throughout the film. For those who wish to be emotionally uplifted, 'Hope Springs' is for you.to re-establish intimacy, has failed.<br /><br />But Dr. Feld was right all along.

B0088T3B0G|2.0|The sound quality was not that good. Perhaps because it was made in 1995, but I had to turn it up during the quiet parts, then down during the loud explosions.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|wow this was as advertised I bought it as a gift and my brother loved it. all albums played perfectly.
B000I9YWDO|5.0|IF YOU WORK IN AN OFFICE, THIS IS A MUST SEE! IT'S SUPER FUNNY!!! I LOVE IT! I LAUGHED UNTIL I CRIED!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I really enjoyed this. It was a different yet enjoyable format. The stories are quite varied and interesting. My only real complaint is that toward the middle some of the stories are very long, which is generally fine, but toward the end some of them are incredibly short. Why would this interviewer travel across the globe to interview somebody and get just a minute or two of an interview? The vast majority of stories are of about perfect length.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Acting is sometimes bad, so is the writing, but damn do i still love it. 5 more words were required.
0452273331|5.0|If you aren't familiar with Ayn Rand, I would probably start with Atlas Shrugged but Fountainhead is a good fiction read as well.  Ayn's writing style tends to be a little verbose.  And this story was shocking in its day... which is probably why it is still read now.  Ayn also is very anti-government so you see that in her writings.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Quick read and very compelling. Characters well developed.  Written in great detail. You feel like they become apart of your family.
B008L40Q7E|4.0|This is one of bonds best books and is required reading for any serious bond fan. im required to write these words so here you are.
B00CM9JKQM|1.0|Took chance, not worth it.  Bland.  New singer doesn't help matters. Metal by numbers effort, no doubt. Seeing other reviews you'd think this was empire, mindcrime glory over again, not at all.  Guys take warning and listen to samples or youtube before buying.  I'm a casual fan at best and hoping the big \\"return to form\\" promise/hype would be delivered.  Not the case.  All this supposed bottled up creativity that was held back for years and this is what we get?  Others state this is a stellar effort.  Again please review the songs before making the purchase.

B004G0SJU8|3.0|First, why dress angels in black??  Oh well, they do make the star look facially divine (Cage), and interesting the way the angels are on top of buildings and everywhere.  They did depict the angels as helpers and saving lives.  That was nice.<br />Over all the acting by Nicholas Cage and Megan Ryan was good and believable, but Megan is such an alive person that she doesn't portray the end well.  There was such a build up for them to finally get together, it was strange for it to end abruptly.  That was weird and very quick.  You knew it was coming since directors seem to know to make a person look joyously angelic before something happens, so it will shock us.  She is riding her bike down a hill with her eyes closed?  Thankfully angels don't turn human and marry us.  The Bible refers to early evil angels who came to earth and seduced women.  These were evil angels who were destroyed in the flood where everyone but Noah/his family  and animals were destroyed.  Of course lies about it make good movies??

B002QNTNL6|5.0|This girl has a gift.  Give her a feeling and she has the perfect hilarious facial expression to express it.<br />Any woman has experienced the feeling of wanting to win someone special.  Well, this girl took it to a new level.<br />I am not into teenage movies, but when this girl's antics started, I have to say it was one of the funniest movies I've seen.<br />She's creative to say the least.  Another good thing, this movie is very clean and wholesome and every scene, no matter how weird it gets seems real with her great acting.  There's one scene I won't forget but I won't ruin it.  I'll just say the strange noises were timely.  he he he

B000C1YPY4|4.0|I like this SACD. Sounds great. Great price. Dynamics are there. The album has all vary kinds of soulful music. Super bass on much of it. I would reason they created this one for 5.1 and thought that folks would have a subwoofer. Without question a solid SACD engineering. (With a little treble/bass adjustment) I got mine for around $8, don't pass it up for that price.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is so much fun to build homes, creations and go mining for ore (especially diamonds!) I have gotten some of my friends to like it and when ever I can get the chance to play I will. This game is extremely obsessive and sooooo much fun. TNT is awesome and I love to blow it up.  but unfortunately, flint and steel was not added in creative mode. (flint and steel is the tool used to light TNT.) I  also love the baby pigs.  (They are so cute!) This game deserves a 5 star rating and what ever you do I recommend you buy it.

B00DF0POXA|4.0|Experimental. But unlike 808's, where it sounded like he had a clearer vision of what he was trying to do. This goes more for a &#34;jolt factor&#34;. It still works because of his great ear and awesome, detailed production. While I didn't find any tracks I needed to skip, it doesn't sound as cohesive as his albums usually do. It'll be a shame if this is the one that gets him a Grammy. But still a musical genius IMHO and it shows.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover is witty and had me laughing out loud, but then crying minutes later. I love when an author can do that. It's my first Colleen Hoover book and I am now a definite fan! An amazing read and highly recommended.  The last few words at the end of the book will leave you closing your book feeling so satisfied you made the purchase.
1400097029|3.0|The book was pedantic and overly written. It seemed that Banville wanted to use 10 words when one would do. The scenes were pedestrian at best.
0812993845|2.0|Too silly - all her books are like a sorbet between books that make me think - but this was just too bad
B003QF8E4A|4.0|I went in to this movie, assuming like many others, that it was horror based.  Unfortunately the trailors were editted to only show the very few scary parts.  Anyways this was actually good for me, because I hate horror, yet was dying to see this movie.  I would put it more in the suspense genre, or suspense with intellectual twists.  Overall, I thought it was great!

B0066NA8CU|5.0|I love Julianna Marguiles from ER, which is why I first caught this show when it was airing. I was really excited to find it on Amazon Prime Videos. And after rewatching it all again, I love it even more. The show has incredible writing. I am a little spoiled by this show because sometimes I feel disappointed in guessing how other shows conclude their story lines. The show has an amazing cast, who continue to show me different sides to them. Archie Panjab is amazing in this show. I love her and her character. Josh Charles, Christine Baranski, and Alan Cumming are just a few of the others that make up this amazing cast. I am always surprised by where the show is going and how good it is. The guest stars on this show are also amazing, including Michael J. Fox. It's a MUST WATCH show!
1781162646|5.0|I just started and can't put it down. Like all Stephen King books, the characters are well developed and never a dull moment.  Well done, Mr. King!
B002BI6SMI|5.0|This movie belongs to my preferred movie list for a number of reasons. First, it is a plausible story of the risks involved when traveling abroad. Second, we have a believable hero, not a bodybuilder or a wrestler that will struggle to the bitter end to rescue his daughter no matter what. The other thing that comes  to mind is that even characters like the one played by Liam Neeson have family problems so it adds credibility to the story.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This is my primary watch. I wear it almost every day because it looks good, and works well. It tends to lose about 2-3 minutes each month, as is standard for an auto. The canvas seems pretty durable. I've worn this watch in all types of environments, and in each, it has worked as expected.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read this book in three days, it sucked me in. I can't wait to read the next one. This series is one of the best I have ever read.
B006S53QCK|3.0|Depends on what your goal is for the evening watching this older movie.  I know it gets good ratings and it has a certain air of sensuality about it with some really steamy areas but there are some titles with more steamy effect if you get my drift.<br /><br />Good for a quiet date night at home along with a good (or cheap) wine as long as you're with the right person!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I read these as a child and now I'm reading them again. I loved returning to Oz once again. I will be sharing this with my children. This kindle version doesn't have pictures but it is formatted well and was easy to read.

B0069JBKHI|3.0|Overall this is a good product and it's better than any other plug-and-play video monitor currently in the baby market(\\"baby market\\" being the operative words).<br /><br />Having owned the monitor for over a year I am in a unique position to give a well rounded review.  I have found most owners are overly eager to review prior to experiencing some of the more notorious and well documented issues.<br /><br />This product seems really great at first but inevitably starts to show it's true colors.  If you expect this to stream audio all throughout the night, without interruption your're in for a disappointment.  Nine out of Ten times the connection is interrupted and your audio turns off leaving you unaware until your child starts crying loud enough to wake you.<br /><br />If and when you do have issues good luck getting them resolved in a timely manner.  Customer service is pretty terrible.  I believe this company is headquartered somewhere in France and the only way to communicate with them is via email.  That said, it takes an average of 5 days for them to respond and if they address your concern the first time around consider yourself lucky.<br /><br />As far a video baby monitor is concerned, it's great when it works and it works 85% of the time.  When it doesn't work it is extremely frustrating there is no timely fix.  This could mean you're without a monitor for days or even weeks which only amplifies the frustration.  It seems as though Withings was a little too ambitious with this product and released it prior to properly dev testing and resolving every last bug.<br /><br />Overall, if I had a choice to purchase again I would probably go in a different direction.  It is important to realize there are other comparably priced wireless networking cameras which are not specifically marketed to the baby demographic.  Said wireless network cameras primary function is to stream audio/video reliably and as a bonus, can also be repurposed when the children are older.  They don't come with multi-colored night lights and lullabies but consider what is more important to you..bells and whistles or reliable audio/video functionality.<br /><br />Pros: Remote and or off-site audio/video monitoring from anywhere(when it works), Nightlight, Lullabies, Easy to use app.<br /><br />Cons: Expensive, Poor Customer Service, Overnight continuous audio monitoring failure, Bulky and or not versatile.They don't come with multi-colored night lights and lullabies but consider what is more important to you..bells and whistles or reliable audio/video functionality.<br /><br />Pros: Remote and or off-site audio/video monitoring from anywhere(when it works), Nightlight, Lullabies, Easy to use app.<br /><br />Cons: Expensive, Poor Customer Service, Overnight continuous audio monitoring failure, Bulky and or not versatile.

B00AO2TREY|2.0|I waited feverishly for news of a follow-up to 'Happiness.' That album was pure, perfect, pop music. Epic, with interesting lyrics and lush production. I about hit the ceiling when I saw news of 'Exile's' release. After listening to it all the way through (which took me two tries?), I must say this is extremely disappointing. It sounds like they had no new ideas, so they went out and paid for a flashy photo shoot. After that, they just hashed out some generic lyrics over productions inspired by the first album. The production is still very lush, but not a single song grabbed me and took me flying like so many from the first. The biggest low for me here is the bad lyrics. It's an album filled with soap-opera heartache (theatrics); somewhat like a teenage girl's perspective on break-ups/relationships (very shallow). So un-inspired; I was instantly sick of hearing him moan about \\"closing his eyes.\\" As an instrumental, it could have been good.<br />  I look forward to round three. 'Happiness' was so good, I just can't help but hope there can be another album close to as pristine as it was.
B009NY43NY|1.0|After 12 books, I think it is a shame that Harris chose to end the series how she did.  She states that it was how she planned on ending the series all along, but it's hard to believe given how random it all seemed.  My problem isn't with the ending exactly, but with how it was executed.  If you want me to care and be happy, then provide a little backstory in the previous 12 books that makes the ending probable.  And don't completely change one of the most dynamic characters, who people have grown to care about, into a static one-dimensional bit player in the last book.  What a way to end one of my favorite series -- the disappointment was Lost-esque.  But, like Lost, it will remain one of my favorites despite the failure to provide any coherent, conceivable closure.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I honestly LOVED this series, which I thought would end by this third 3rd book. Sylvia left the book ending open, it could have completely been finished.  A 4th book is unnecessary.... very disappointed that she decided to D-R-A-G out the series. Desperate for sales I suppose.

B00D2CYU2W|1.0|Basically, an extended hatchet job on Liberace, Scott Thorson, and gay people in general.  It never transcends the \\"Ewwwwwww! Queers!\\" position.  Despite some fine work from Matt Damon, this film is a botch.  Sad.  If the Steven Soderbergh of SEX LIES AND VIDEOTAPE had shown up, we might have gotten an interesting film about actual human beings.  Alas, we got the Steven Soderbergh of those OCEAN films, and all we got is a bunch of tasteless barely one-dimensional pasteboard figures going through the highly sensationalized motions.<br /><br />Liberace deserved better.  So does the audience.  A real missed opportunity.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|Graphics were awesome, the world of OZ was beautiful to look at.<br />The story line was OK, not perfect but it did neatly fit into the existing OZ stories that we know and love.<br />The only detractor is the acting.  In some places it was so bad I couldn't tell if the character was sad or happy from the expressions on their faces.<br />Still - definitely worth the rental
1579128149|5.0|I bought this for a young adult and then purchased another for someone who loves science. It's great for everyone.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really liked this game- it makes you think, without being so difficult that it isn't fun. I only wish there were more levels!
B002N44XSG|5.0|This new take on Greek and roman mythology is an instant page turner. I feel inspired by the heroes and their struggles.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this whole series it was wonderful. I couldn't hardly put it down, couldn't wait to read what was going to happen next!
B00CW665VI|4.0|Let me start by saying I don't usually write out reviews I just mark off how many stars I think a book deserves and move on to the next one.  I had to write my thoughts on this one,  this book was hilarious at times and blunt and honest.  The story is told as if drew himself was telling you what happened.  I was hesitant to read a book like this but I took a chance and I'm glad I read this.  I literally LOLed while reading this.  Rarely does that happen when I read a book ill smile or chuckle but this book at times had me cracking up.  I love Kate and drew and I'm glad they got their happy ever after and in one book not a 7 books series that's dragged out lol.
B004SOR4H6|1.0|The latest update has turned Twitter into an app that fails even when it isn't running. No mean feat. Please fix this soon.
B00BI73CVI|1.0|NOT WORTH THE $5 RENTAL I MUST BE A REAL DUMMY FOR LETTING MY WIFE TALK ME INTO IT.  DID NOT ENJOY ONE SECOND.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|It was a well written  book and it keep your interest I really like the interaction of both partners. It had many side theme to the book and it keep you guessing and the outcome was really great.
B005D4YOHI|1.0|Having read the reviews, I ordered these a 1/2 size larger than my regular shoe size and they still didn't fit. I'm annoyed at a manufacturer who can't bring its product into at least reasonable conformity with standard shoes sizes and in fact am so annoyed that I'm returning these and will not seek a larger pair at the local outfitter store. Not a repeat customer for Keen, that's certain.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Love this movie.. very entertaining and not overly done. Great way to animate the story!! The giants were fantastic. 4 stars for this one. :)
B008XKSW7M|4.0|This is a well-acted blend of stories showing some of the many challenges faced by couples while they were expecting.  Even though it is a comedy, it does not completely steer away from the tragedy that is also part of the drama of new life.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Only get 10 rooms on FREE app. I kept saying to myself that it made me feel stupid. Then I would have a moment when it would click and I would think maybe I am not as stupid as I thought. Overall it kept me entertained for what it was, a free app that I finished quickly.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This book is a no \\"BS\\" guide to building the body you want. Also the author will ACTUALLY email you back and offer his assistance as needed. What more can I say? The book is short, sweet, and pretty much everything you need to know. It has sparked a whole new interest in health and fitness in my life.
B00BOX0K0M|1.0|Filter is a polarizer with a safety line (thread) that I cannot figure out how to attach to the gopro case.  The filter was scratched when wiping water off surface with a soft cloth.  I won't be buying this again.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Glad I downloaded this to download great videos to my tablet...fast, easy and great for viewing videos when flying without wifi.
1781162646|5.0|Stephen King's newest book feels like one of his oldest. It is a book to be relished--it can be read in an afternoon, but the characters, settings and descriptions deserve a slow, thoughtful reading. This is King, the storyteller, at his very best. Take your time, and savor the experience.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Classic Myst style gameplay is what I was hoping for and it's what I got. I highly recommend this game.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|It's sort of awesome. It even lets you change the brightness without going to the menu.  But if they wanted to make it better,they could make it so the different types of clocks were free. Yeah but for the most part pretty cool until you see the world of awesome outside of your house. Five stars! Bravo to the makers of this app!!!! B-)
074322454X|5.0|Everyone should read this book and learn what really went on in WWII. Most of these guys have passed but their story should be told to every generation. Great heroes and men of amazing character.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I enjoyed this so much, I was ready to see it again before we finished watching it. Great, great acting.
B00BESCJII|5.0|had no idea what to expect with this film. Turned out to be a great movie! I would pay to watch again and have recommended to my family and friends
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Rather engaging, with an even flow in the story and great performances<br />that elevate the film to a classic status.
B000I9VON0|4.0|I could watch this movie over and over.  Clever plot and great cast. Although somewhat dated, the plot is clever and fun.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|You will fall in love with the show, you will spend hours, days, weeks, months watching it with your family, anticipating everything and biting your nails. When you get to the last episode you will shut your mouth and sit on the edge of your seat. And, as Arthur and Merlin go on their FINAL journey you will keep telling yourself \\"everything will be ok, happy endings\\". But those last five minutes... you will bring the gun to your head and be ready to shoot yourself as the credits begin to role. You will shut off your tv and star at it. Then you will get up and numbly walk into your kitchen sit down at your computer and trash this show like no other. You will think about the months wasted, the social life you could have had, and you will do just what I am doing now... enjoy...
B00785P2QC|4.0|My best friend told me to look this game up because she loved it. I think you should play this because you can use real money to get things faster but its not a nasesity.
1878424114|5.0|I love going back through this book and picking up on things I didn't understand before. It's the perfect length to re-read easily and has everything you need to know well organized and concise.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|See title. This app is fantastic. Works great on my samsung galaxy. Fun and addicting. I need 5 more words.
B006GH6IS4|4.0|Queen 40 years, that was 2011, the reissues, the box sets, books and documentaries, all flooding the market.<br />Among them this little documentary gem, released in the UK (mid January 2012 release date set for here in the US) on region free Blu ray disc.<br />There has been some consternation about the fact that the BD runs longer than the trimmed DVD release, and I can offer no insight. The BD has nice picture and sound, but is by no means stunning, most of the footage shown in the documentary is old and not restored, or upgraded to HD, so it's a good picture, not a stunning one.<br />The main feature is a two part documentary charting the beginnings of the band, through to their last live performance in 1986, and then what came next.<br />Most of the footage is narrated in interview style with Brian May, and Roger Taylor mostly. John Deacon (the bass player) seeming to have disappeared intentionally from the public eye, is not seen much, and the footage of Freddie is obviously old.<br /><br />There is quite a bit of new footage, some unseen screen tests for videos, and the unseen live aid practice, all padded out with a chronology of hits, shows, ups and downs.<br />It was interesting to learn about some of the inner turmoil, the quiet solo attempts, not only from Freddie, but Brian and Roger also.<br />There are many interesting interviews with the likes of Paul Gambucinni, long time roadie Peter Hince, and their former manager, as well as news reports, clips covering the highs and the lows.<br />The immense crowds of South America, the mistake of Sun City, the long time break through to the USA, and so on.<br /><br />The second part of the documentary deals with the high points, virtual split and then masterful reunion for Live Aid, and the massive '86 tour.<br />It also deals with Freddie's health, decline and ultimate end, and though delicately handled, it is sad and very bittersweet.<br /><br />So 40 years? Well yes and no, 25 years since their last live concert as a complete band, and 20 years since the death of Freddie, yet here we are - still absorbed, still watching.<br />Arguably one of the greatest rock bands of the 20th century, certainly one, if not THE founders of \\"stadium\\" rock, who left an endearing legacy of great music.<br /><br />Much of the the footage can be seen in other documentaries like Queen - Under Review - 1980-1991 and Queen - Under Review 1973-1980 but these are mostly the ramblings of other people. This BD has probably the most real input from the band, mostly Roger and Brian as already mentioned, but for any fan, or anyone who simply wants to know more about the band, it's certainly worth the money.ncert as a complete band, and 20 years since the death of Freddie, yet here we are - still absorbed, still watching.<br />Arguably one of the greatest rock bands of the 20th century, certainly one, if not THE founders of \\"stadium\\" rock, who left an endearing legacy of great music.<br /><br />Much of the the footage can be seen in other documentaries like Queen - Under Review - 1980-1991 and Queen - Under Review 1973-1980 but these are mostly the ramblings of other people.

038572179X|3.0|I didn't think this book was a light easy read, but it was an interesting complex story. I had to make myself read it, but I'm glad I did. I own the movie and I understand it so much more after reading the book.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|The story of how they find the  Forgotten Garden, and Nell's family,also so some what of a love story, also mystery!
B009NY43NY|1.0|I can't believe I paid $15 for that crap. I should have known...  The series started getting weird and annoying about 4 books ago. Why did I keep reading then?  I guess curiosity just got the better of me. I shouldn't have wasted my time. It was sloppy, not well thought out, and a really lack-luster way to end the series. It also felt like it had all been done before. What? There's a secret plot to kill Sookie? Wow, that is so original and different from the other books. I want my money back.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game.  Doesn't take long to get totally absorbed.  Levels are challenging with just the right touch of frustration to keep you playing.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It is a very enjoyable and entertaining game. I would definitely recommend it and am looking forward to the next release.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Yeehaw, just what the doctor ordered while cooling your heels in the good doctor's waiting room.  A very pleasant diversion or relaxation for relieving stress.
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|A good movie to enjoy, but the story is hard to believe. They tried very hard to talk about the difference and relationship of the father and son, but failed in big time. This is true that you can not mix a movie mainly for entertainment with trying to reveal true humane nature.
B002SRQ214|4.0|When my motherboard/CPU died, I chose this CPU with an ASRock motherboard.  They've performed fantastically and without a problem.  An inexpensive yet decent upgrade.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Good game, can really get into it and pass the time. Recommend it to those who enjoy a a game with need for fast reflexes.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Much more convenient than the built in Kindle battery life display. Provides more accurate and detailed information about the battery so you can better manage your usage.
B000057DON|5.0|As good a rock album ever, not a personal fan of Axel, but the  music more than makes up for it. Slash is dead on his game!
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|Still is one of my favorite mobster/gangster flicks.  Great acting and put it behind the Godfather movies in the genre.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|Inevitably compared to Tolkien 's trilogy. It's harder to follow and lacks Tolkein's literary depth and imagination, but reading the Song of Ice Fire is still better than watching it on TV
B009A9EQL6|5.0|Disclaimer: I'm a hardcore Aerosmith fan since the early '70s and they were one of the main influences in my life that prompted me to seek a career in the music biz..so yeah that means I love these guys.<br />I got the CD from Amazon when it was first released and I know there are mixed reviews of the material and I agree that some songs are not the band's best efforts.<br />That said...the DVD that comes with this special edition is GREAT!<br />The 4 live tunes showcase Aerosmith LIVE at their best. There's a reason their shows sell out when they tour and the DVD shows why.<br />The interviews that follow the live tunes will be revealing to fans...other folks may not &#34;get it&#34;.<br />BIG bonus for me..the live version of Train Kept A Rollin' featuring Johnny Depp is from the show I attended at the Hollywood Bowl last summer! Johnny more than holds his own with the guys.<br />I wish I could get a DVD of that entire show; it was one of those that I walked out of thinking &#34;I wanna see that again&#34; and I'm super happy to find at least one song featured.<br />And a shout-out to Amazon...it showed up a day earlier than promised!
B003JH8LPW|4.0|As with all other Dan Brown novels, this book pulls you in with the first page and rushes headlong to the finish.  The fact that I was reading it while the release of NSA spying on Americans was occurring was an added bonus, and one wonders if Mr. Brown had some information we didn't have about the NSA when he was writing the book!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This was a very entertaining novel by John Grisham.  It was an easy read and I finished it in two days.  The only downside is that it was pretty predictable and you will probably guess a good deal of how the book is going to end.  If you want a good, mindless summer read then this is the book for you.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is a really fun game and it kinda like the xbox version just pocket edition I swear that your going to want it
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I grew up with the movie, but I had never read the book.  I was happy that the Tinman turned out to be a real badass.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This movie was very well directed. The book however explains a lot more, but you can't expect that kind of background to be covered in a movie. Most people who have also read the book would say I am crazy to give the movie 5 stars, but I'm not comparing this movie to its book. To compare it to the book would be like comparing a picture of the Roman collusium to being there. I am comparing this book to other movies I have watched, and this one is so unique. It is different from the many love stories, action movies, and comodies. This movie is in its own catagory. It is full of suspence and suprises.
B00AIBZM40|2.0|This movie is no winner...Feral children skittering about was more ineresting than the mama character. I am just so glad I did not pay full price to see this at the theater..Those of you who call it scary? Really? The only thing good about it was seeing the guy who plays Jamie Lannister in it yet wondering why? The ending is a dud. 2 stars is me being generous.
B00COGXX7A|5.0|Watched this movie because I am a Nicholas Sparks fan.  His movies tend to have a pattern to them, but this one had an interesting and unexpected twist at the end!  Worth viewing!
159463176X|5.0|I could not put this book down once I got past the first two chapters. I loved The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns (A Thousand Splendid Suns was my favorite)...but this book is a terrific read.The characters are so rich, the story so wonderfully told. Hosseini is a brilliant storyteller.
159463176X|5.0|Excellent story by excellent writer. If u liked THE KITE RUNNER, read this too. Less political,<br />moving very moving characterization and storyline.
B002WY65W4|5.0|This is a fun film. Eisenburg and Harrelson are fantastic in this. Given all the Zombie craze in films lately you can't beat this one for humor. So have a Twinkie and watch a hilarious film. By the way Twinkies are back. For awhile I was feeling as devestated as Harrelson's character when they left. Zombies and twinkies and ya can't go wrong! 5 stars
B002NN5F7A|3.0|Selected to watch this movie because of the all star cast featured in it.  Was actually kind of a strange movie with an uninteresting story line.  The part that sticks most in my mind was all the yelling and profanity.
B001NY4X4G|5.0|Great movie with a twist. Awsome. It really caught me off guard which is in my opinion the best kind of movies.
B00BQ1D7X4|3.0|This album was not as good as the previous &#34;Black Turns to Blue&#34; album.  The yyrics were not as interesting and just didn't pull me in.  It all felt a bit labored and I was generally disappointed.
0345803493|5.0|This book is even better then the first. It sucks you in right from the first page. I loved how it wasnt just about the relentless sex but has a good plot to it that is just as enticing as the chemestry between Anna and Cristian. Loved it and cant wait to read Fifty Shades Freed.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I had the best server ever than I went to get on and it was creative and I got so mad that took me 5 weeks to do than everything was ruined than a day after that I made another server and now I'm happy :) !
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|At the beginning it was hard to learn how to play, but I couldn't stop until I reached the 10000000 points and free the little guy!
0375842209|5.0|This book sheds light on the compassion of common people during war and should be read by as many people as possible.  An important work with a beautiful, interesing story containing miniature graphic novels as part of the story.  Wow.
0425263924|5.0|Waiting, waiting and waiting is the hardest thing I hate to do. When I started reading the Crossfire novels I kept comparing them to the 50 Shades of Grey since I had just finished them. But I am so hooked on Giedon and Eva. I am hoping it's not going to be another six months or a year. Love them those guys keep them coming. :)
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Love all the books of this series.  Amazing how many sub-plots there are.  Characters are very interesting.  I like how these families are traced for about 80 years.
B008KP6ENE|2.0|I think this game will be so funny, but it's like a new-new-new version of mario bros, still fun but not amaziing.
B005MMYBXI|5.0|I am a huge fan of the Spartacus series on Starz!!! Friday night is just not the same!!! It made me a huge fan of the actors! Andy Whitfield started it! We lost a great talent to early. Manu Bennett is awesome, I now watch him on Arrow. Dustin Claire is also amazing, I will continue to follow his career. Liam McIntire took over the role of Spartacus after Andy passed away and made it his own!
0425263908|5.0|I had just finished reading the 50 Shades of Grey. So when I started this book I kept comparing them in my head. It took about half way through the book for it to stop. I feel in love with Giedon and Eva and couldn't wait until the next book came along and the waiting for the 3rd book was hard.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I enjoyed this book as much as the other two.  I couldn't put it down.  Can't wait to go to the next one.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|this is the film that made me a jeremy reimer fan. besides being a fast paced, well written, tight story, this film shows him capable of a light touch, humor and tenderness. great cast all the way around and you needn't have seen any of the previous borne films to enjoy it.
B00BU18U82|5.0|After i figured the game out my grandson loves it and he's only 3.5 years old! He did better then I did.
0425263916|5.0|Keep them coming, I hope the series never ends. I look forward to another one soon. Love the Crossfire Series
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Definitely worth the wait ,great deal ,and great for little kids. My two year old brothers love it. Must have you won't deny.
B008XBHIEY|5.0|Amazing trip down memory lane, with outstanding performances all around [especially the shark]. The horror film with real side-splitting laughter in it too.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved this book.  It gives so much insight to life in Afghanistan.  The interweaving of the lives of the characters is wonderful.  I highly recommend it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun game.  Not too difficult to make it unplayable. Also not too easy to make it boring.  Hope I can find other games like this.
B003KRGCTI|4.0|This movie lends perspective to what the world of tomorrow could be like if we don't pay attention. It's an eye opener to a future we could be stuck with if we don't pay attention to our leaders and to scrutinize to words that come out of their mouths. The ungodly won't appreciate what this movie stands for, but they will love the violence and anarchy it portrays. It reminds me of &#34;The Postman&#34;, with a biblical perspective.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|Predictable ending. Good acting by John Goodman and Denzel Washington. Great stunt involving rolling of plane. Otherwise, predictable and long.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Good story telling with wonderful insite into life in a world far away from my life.<br /><br />Too many of the characters were left hanging.  It would be nice, after developing so many interesting characters, if there was more about their life as it followed through the years the story emcompasses.  I am not saying that everyone had to die or ride off into the sunset but then again I love long novels with many characters.  Think &#34;Game of Thrones&#34; and &#34;Pillars of the Earth&#34;.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game was the best I really love building stuff in this app I think  this app is really cool
B0061S073A|5.0|This app works great! I love my Kindle Fire &amp;so does my 4yr old son, however Amazon didn't really include much in the way of parental controls &amp;this app fixes that problem once and for all! On initial launch of this app, you pick a 4digit PIN and from there you are able to make a list of what apps your child is allowed to use, as well as access to the browser, app store, purchasing capabilities, even volume control. This app creates a separate &quot;kids place homepage&quot; for your child when they press the home button that lists only what you have included on the allowed list of apps. Ive tried several other content and app blockers before this and my son has managed to get around them all until I downloaded Kids Place. Now I dont have to worry that my son will randomly wreak havoc on my kindle content every time he wants to play one of his games. Even my mom finally broke down and got this app after repeatedly having her kindle de-registered by my son while the kindle parental control locks were on. If you want you child to play their games and only their games this app will do exactly that for you.
B007ME5BUG|5.0|In spite of other review, I found this book to be in depth, insightful and very readable.  I learned a few new things as well.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Loved it, written well, fast reading, good narrative.  Not usually my type of book, but, couldn't put it down. Not so descriptive on the gory parts, easy to get by if that's what you don't like.
0062255657|1.0|Flat characters, a forgettable mythology, and frenetic pacing join forces to make this short and joyless book a totally throwaway experience.  It's almost impossible to believe that it came from the same author who penned American Gods, although the impenetrable plotting in Anansi Boys certainly presages Gaiman's rushed and lazy technique in Ocean at the End of the Lane.<br /><br />This book is overpriced, underwritten, and an insult to the author's readers.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is a good way to kill time and it does make you think towards the end of the rooms.
B00BSBVLF8|3.0|Video would stop playing.<br />Had to restart it four times; after the fourth time gave up.<br />Movie seemed interesting but didn't see much.
B002I9Z8I0|4.0|Quality of DVD correct<br />Films contents valid if your a startrek fan and want to remember how it use to be
B0029ZA49Q|4.0|This harness is supposed to be used with a top-loading camera case, but I used a metal ring from an old belt and some lanyard clips to make it work as a stand-alone shoulder harness. Seems to work great so far, and it's much cheaper than some of the other harnesses I found.
B001A4LYN2|5.0|Incredibly compelling story.  The only criticism I hear about this movie is that it is pretty long so you need to commit yourself to paying close attention the whole time.<br /><br />This has incredible acting across the board.  Daniel Day Lewis and Paul Dano give some of the better acting performance's i've seen.  I would recommend this movie to anyone.
B00CEQ1HOQ|5.0|The product arrived in good condition and the person who received it was VERY excited.I would recommend this for any young girl or boy who who appreciates uniqueness.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I can't stop playing it. Have to limit my playing time for weekends because I get up @ 4AM for work during the week.
0385720920|5.0|If you are fan of satirical or dark humor novels then would I recommend this book it's also a short read so not in convenient for those of you with busy lifestyles.
B004LWZWBU|5.0|Three of my favorite actors are in this film. I loved the book and also love the movie, I have already watched it several times!
B006O6EOII|5.0|Perfect for the zombie-loving child or any zombie-loving adult still in tune with the kid inside them. Ghoulia is a great addition to anyone's action figure collection.
B00CVCG87O|5.0|Not sure how to put it into words...This album is just fantastic though, listen to it the whole way through, it's that good. Consult youtube a full album playthrough. The song Resist is especially good, gives me chills when I hear it.<br /><br />The vocals are clean which I didn't care much for in progressive metal/djent, but with TesseracT I don't feel that way, I actually really like the vocals.<br /><br />Give it a listen as you will most likely really enjoy this album if you've somehow stumbled upon it.
B0062QRTKA|5.0|Well worth the price. Great game play! When I saw the description I didn't know of they would pull it off, but they did and it is challenging as you go further along.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I love the new update.It's fast easy to understand.It's #1 out of all pretexting apps in the entire world.Now before I was really annoyed when it kept saying this is taking longer then it should please try again later and then it was deleted from the app store,sometimes it says that but not much anymore.Get this app it's worth it you'll be able to text you friends family that live far away or just around the block.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|I watched this series back in the 70's and loved it. I had forgotten that it started with some black and white episodes and consentration on the downstairs, so I was a little puzzled at first.  The characters and actors and screenplays are so well done and professional.  And, I'm watching it on my tablet so I can watch it whenever I have time.  Also, rather than having to find where I left off, my tablet always goes right back to where it stopped the last time.  Thank you for making this available.
B003JUGQ38|2.0|I hate this new sidekick even more than the donkey-faced first one. Her character is just an obnoxious know it all who won;t do a thing she's told. Her performance and character are totally unbelievable. A mystic cult is seconds from plunging a knife in her heart and she's telling them how she's going to kick their ass. Right, perfectly believable reaction. Already looking forward to season 5 just so i don't have to watch her. The stories themselves are okay bit not stellar. Despite changing The Doctor, season 2 had some of the best writing I've seen and this one has not quite matched it.
B004LPLU4K|1.0|I had originally thought this was the 80's version which I enjoyed much more than the 5 minutes of this I saw but maybe that wasn't enough to judge properly
B008XG1X18|5.0|My dad got this on his phone it was really cool so I looked it up on my kindle fire and got some really cool ideas me and my dad made a flag pallet.<br /> it looked great!
B005C8ENI0|4.0|This was a good story with great actors and not too sappy for the guys. This is the way I wish I could do business.
B0074MZSWW|4.0|Could hear some Amy Winehouse raw pain, and Adele tenderness. Great jukin', go girl. Love the live sound feed back too.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a very good and entertaining game, that I have enjoyed for several days. The levels are not very hard but tthey still take some thought to solve, which means that a single puzzle takes 5-8 minutes to solve. This is the perfect duration for when I don't have time to engage in very complex games, but I also don't want the simplicity of the most casual games but a bit more of a challenge.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Rock me Momma like a wagon wheel... Hey momma rock me!!! And I didn't have 2 go 2 the store and buy it!!! LOL!!!
B00BN4JQ6G|5.0|I am slow to buy alblums until I know theres more than say one song that I want, which means I missed a lot of good music from KOL. I didn't really become a fan until a year after Only by the Night was released and have since watched alot of youtube with my granddaughter, both of us becoming avid fans (ok so at 1 she's just there to rock to sleep with gramps but she does like the music).<br />This set was made for someone like me. I couldn't get enough KOL but the only record store I'll buy from is quite a distance and I'm on a tight budget. I couldn't be happier with this box set and wish that more bands had such a great deal for their music library.<br /><br />If you are looking into this set you probably know the bands hits and are wondering what else may be good and to that I say \\"A Lot!\\". Kings of Leon may be a classic southern rock band in their style but they do so love to experiment. Many songs I have found don't jump out at you as great until a week later you're still stuck on that cool bass beat (I play around on the bass so thats my thing) or odd guitar riff. Every alblum of theirs deserves multiple listening and you may find that a song that you didn't even like grows on you and takes ahold of you and won't let go. Such is the nature of good rock bands.<br /><br />So take a chance. It is a very good deal if you don't already have their alblums. I bought it even though I had one already and it's still worth it.
B007DIQC90|5.0|Pleasant surprise. Will follow this group.I am starting to hear some of this expression in other recordings. To mimic is the best compliment.
B00BHMEOP2|5.0|I saw this for the first time at the movies and knew I would buy it once it was released.  The actors really make you feel like you are there with them.  I was nervous all over again the second time I watched it.  Also, my husband, as well as my 8 year old both loved it.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|The ones who rated one star I know why it keeps crashing and having errors when u download it...... when it crashes it means That u don't have that much storage left for the game to process.....and to get space back if your deleting it delete it out of the device and carasoule......and when it says error for downloading it... it means your wifi I sent on or you don't have enough storage....... one more thing about this game..... the controls are a little bit glitchy.... so get used to it... don't freak out its just a game...... the controls will get better at Modern combat 5
B008764ZQ4|4.0|If you've seen the movie you know what to expect. I liked the movie and I like the soundtrack. Good songs sung by different people so of course they are not exactly the same as the original bands.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I hope to see more games like can you escape.  the levels are fun and keep you thinking.  I can escape
B00CDXOPYE|5.0|This movie is a timeless story.  Great storyline, you can relate to the characters, thriller, suspense, family, romance - it is all there!  I originally saw the movie in the theater, then read the book and now purchased it via Amazon Instant Video.  We have already watched it 2x at my house.  I love the fact I can watch it on all of my devices (ipad, android, computer, smart tv, etc.)  Love!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Super dystopian fiction. The protagonist finds inner strength, blah blah. Oh by the way, jingoism is bad. Let's throw that in last minute.<br /><br />Nothing groundbreaking, but a pleasant, light read.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game is stress releasing and wonderful. I have nothing bad to say about it! Keep up the tools work on these apps.
B0062QRTKA|5.0|I found another favorite developer!<br /><br />The two guys who made this app really paid attention to what we want: good, clean, challenging fun!  This app delivers all of it, and a bit more.  Be forewarned, however, that it is just slightly irreverent, but with warm humor.  Other than that, the game has excellent graphics, a wonderful stylization, and unique gameplay.  You can tell that extraordinary thought and effort was put into making the game as perfect as possible.<br /><br />You play \\"Mo\\", who is trying to save his people (who too often do things counter to their health) and bring them to a safer place.  You face many challenges (beside the people) such as mummies and enemy ships.  Additionally, there are Challenges to unlock through playing.  Some folks may not like that, but does incentivize you to do well and to master some of the techniques, because, frankly, to do well on them you'll need to really have some of the moves down pat.<br /><br />Most people like a smooth \\"ramp\\" up of difficulty.  Perfecting that \\"ramp\\" is nearly impossible, but this game does a FANTASTIC job of increasing the difficulty.  I do recommend 'replaying' many of the levels (and there are a LOT) until you are comfortable in mastering the technique or objective presented.  If you do this instead of jumping directly into the next level after completing the prior level just once, you might find the game harder than it needs to be.  So \\"ramp\\" up to your ability, then slow down on your progression... you'll be glad you did in later levels when the going gets tougher.<br /><br />Interestingly, the EULA made me smile. :)  As did many other things.  Clearly, the gents have a great sense of humor!  The music is reminiscent at times of Zelda, and while it does get slightly annoying it isn't terrible.  However, you can turn off either the sound or the music, or both, if you like.<br /><br />The only permission is access to the vibrator; it does NOT need internet access (!!) even though it does link to their website and their Facebook page by launching the browser.  In other words, it uses the apps you designate for internet access, which is more about simple information than advertising anything.  Other developers should take serious note, since this is the proper way to access internet information.<br /><br />I hold up The Pixelators as IDEAL DEVELOPERS!  The game won't suit everybody's tastes, and a few will be displeased with the thematics (on both sides of the religious aisle); most others will discover the lighthearted nature of the game and take it for what it is: good, clean fun for kids and adults.  More importantly is the example this app and the developers set on every aspect of the game.  They respect privacy, give ample tutorial, have engaging gameplay, proper app functioning, controls over sound and music, thoughtful increases in difficulty, and so on.<br /><br />In summary: 2 Enthusiastic Thumbs Up!oes link to their website and their Facebook page by launching the browser.

0399165274|3.0|I've read and enjoyed Forsyth's novels for several decades, not just several years, so I know what to expect. In the interest of versimilitude, he can provide as much history, background and context about everything from history to espionage tradecraft as he does narrative. The problem? In his more recent novels, that detail has overwhelmed and drowned the story itself, to the point where his characters become the background to his telling us the details of how the United States goes after those it considers national enemies.<br /><br />This could and should have been a much more interesting and exciting novel, because Forsyth has demonstrated his ability to blend these two elements even-handedly in past books. In [[ASIN:0553574604 Icon]], for instance, we get a heck of a lot of background info, but also a really suspenseful yarn. But in this ultimately tedious tale, we are introduced to vigilante government agencies, drone operators, Pakistani military officers, Marine officers, and even some Somali pirates and hostage negotiators. None of them make much impact on the reader. Forsyth has upset the balance and is telling us far more than he is bothering to show us. I don't know if this is old age, boredom with his formula or something else, but it makes for a tedious novel, and one that compares very poorly with character-rich tomes like [[ASIN:0553297422 The Deceiver]] or action-packed adventures like the classic [[ASIN:B00CVDNJ7A The Day of the Jackal]].<br /><br />It's not that this is unreadable. It isn't. It's just rather tedious, which is a damning thing to have to say about a spy \\"thriller\\", and this time around I even found the twists were predictable. The next time a Forsyth book appears, I'll pass it by in favor of re-reading some of his older work, most of which would earn a 4 or 5 star rating from me. I'm being generous with this three star rating, given that a book that I normally would race through in a few hours took me several days to finish reading.
B0039O8AQK|4.0|Not as good as the book but still great! The acting is reasonably well done and it still makes you hate goldstein.
B008RZF1UO|5.0|Really impressed with the new vocalist on this one. I was worried, but my boyfriend talked me around and I am glad he did! It's a great album!
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I have a friend who has read the books and he loved the movie.  I liked it myself too.  Tom Cruise did a fantastic job in this role.  And as always when purchasing something from Amazon their ability to take care of the customer meets/exceeds their promises.  The picture was clear and the sound was great.
B00280LYIM|4.0|I liked it a lot<br />Because t has action in it and I love the author I was a great book<br />I'd give it 5 stars
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I feel this app is very well made. Challenging on the jewel boards and fun to create the tree of life once again.
B0094LU2TU|1.0|We couldn't rent this movie.  I read about it in this months Popular Mechanics.  We had to buy the movie from Amazon.  The play back is very choppy.  It's like listening to an old record that skips.  I would not recommend buying this movie.  I feel like I got totally ripped off.  I can't focus on the movie because of the constant skipping.  It looks like it might be a really cool indie type alien flick, but I will never know from this experience.
B005DNO7MQ|5.0|This has got to be one of my favorite movies from when I was younger.  I watched this movie after having not seen it for many years and it was just as good as I remembered it being.
B004J64QSI|5.0|The 25th Anniversary Concert version of Les Mis features the best leads ever to sing for this historical musical!!!!! I adore Alfie Boe's voice and characterization of Jean Valjean and Norm Lewis is a marvelous Javert! But my absolute favorite part is when the 4 Valjean's sing the bonus quartet version of BRING HIM HOME and when Alfie enters on the key change, I literally melt!!!! It just doesn't get any better than that!!!!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|this is a great app for kids. they pick up on reading and directions and it is all done with play.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Like how can choose cars, upgrade tires, suspension, equipment, easy to learn to do,<br />Would recommend to anyone to play
B00BNXOMHA|5.0|I bought this for my Granddaughter's 14th birthday and I know she will love it. Thanks! The item arrived in excellent condition and very fat shipping. Again Thank You!
B00CS65JS2|5.0|The whole album is sophisticated, cool, groovy, fun, perfect. Can't stop dancing. Daft Punk has evolved to be one of the best of all times.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|an awesome read-everyone who is doubting the presence of god need to read this. its a book you will read more then once
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|I guess I went into the movie with some preconceived notions about what it would be like—which I try not to do—but the film still surprised me! It was very cool to get an inside look at how the Wizard came to be, and the relationships that he formed along the way. The cast did very well—especially Mila Kunis as the Wicked Witch of the West!! Overall, the film was a fun ride and I would watch it again. Family friendly. Good stuff!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Pretty good game, few noodle scratchers that I couldnt pass like using the paper and pencil.. not so obvious but well thought out and pretty legit. If you find yourself getting stuck and cheat. Youll deff be slapping your forehead after you figure out the solution. However I still dont understand the level with the car and model boat as far as the number pyramid. . That I had to cheat on as well :( good game though
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great app and I find myself using it a lot. I have it on my kindle so you get the extra large buttons, which is really nice. I would recommend it if you're doing basic math, your taxes, or even a little algebra!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I expected some &#34;Disney Type&#34; of story here, and was surprised when it was far from that. It was very interesting but rather violent in places.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I HAVE HATED FOR A BOOK TO END. I ABSOLUTELY ENJOYED THIS STORY SO MUCH.  MY STARS TELL HOW I FELT ABOUT IT.  I REALLY DONT THINK YOU WILL REGRET READING.
B005JR47R6|5.0|This series is compelling and interesting. The only thing I regretted was that I would have liked the season to be infinitely long!
B00B5AP7NY|5.0|Great movie
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Couldn't put it down once I started. You can't stop wanting to know what happens to Katniss, Peeta, and Gale. Bring tissues!
B0090O07S2|5.0|Astounding performance by all the Doors.  Jim Morrison is in great form with a mix of singing and spoken word during the concert.  Superbly remixed sound. Nicely shot and edited..... not a lot of quick cuts and so-called effects to mar the visuals. Most newer concert films are nearly unwatchable because of the silly editing and swooping and panning every 2 seconds.
B0063B2BNE|5.0|I enjoyed watching Bones as it is an interesting story about an FBI agent and a forensic anthropologist. They have great Chemistry together. The episodes are interesting.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|It was a awesome game even though I got only 7 pages IT IS A TOTALLY WORTH THE MONEY GET IT NOW SLENDER IS A LITTLE CREEPY like I said it's WORTH THE MONEY here's the Ceach u can fall through the earth<br />I LOVED IT  I GAVE IT 5/5 STARS BECAUSE... U CAN FINED OUT Y IF U GET IT<br />ONLY 1.00
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|Some of the characters are very well developed and funny (Starks). Others do not need to be introduced due to previous Marvel movies. Still I hate the fact that they changed Hulk (I would have tried to get Bana) and that eventually if they meet the Fantastic 4 they will have to change one between CA and HT.
B00BMQDM10|4.0|I enjoyed Wedding Night, it's a very light read, but very enjoyable. Humorous and fun, the author captured the scenes well.
B00319KS7C|5.0|This movie is based on the ADM price fixing criminal case. It illustrates how greed can facilitate basically good people turning away from the truth. The message is powerful.
0470913029|5.0|If your tired of buying all the junk in the grocery store and want to eat healthier. This book is the one for you!
B00DGXGUSY|5.0|Put on your helmet and grab your battle axe....holy cow I like this album!  I am not sure I have liked an Amon Amarth album as much as this after only one listen. Normally, their albums tend to grow on me over time with maybe a few standout tracks.  I am not exactly sure why this album struck such a chord (no pun) with me out of the gate; but I think I know why. First, it seems to me this album is a little 'heavier' in the bass department than previous efforts; which is something that seems to fit my musical preference. Secondly, I find the guitar work/sound to be heavier than previous efforts. Having always been a metal head, I do like my 'chugging' metal chords/riffs and I find that element to be more present in this album compared to previous efforts. The melodic guitar and harmonies typical of Amon Amarth is still present; you just get to bang your head a little more than usual.  Lastly, in past albums there have always been 3-4 songs I either didn't care for or found to be only 'so-so'.  This time around, there is only 1 such track. So, for me this album is a BIG win.  If you are already a fan of Amon Amarth, this album is a no-brainer. My favorite tracks so far are 'We Shall Destroy', 'Warriors of the North', and 'Hel'.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|It's awesome but when you go through the minefield  if your playing on a kindle fire HD sideways you click on the menu Button and I don't like<br /> That it's auto move
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I don't spent a ton of time on the computer, but when I think of something I want to look for or remember later on, I drop it in Evernote and there it is on my phone.  Pretty cool!
B00CLZ48FA|3.0|The first 30 minutes is boring, then gets interesting , then gets boring again.  I am really dissapointed with this movie.
B00BMTX5IW|5.0|The jazz music is a must have!  Love every song!  Recommend for all jazz lovers. Heard every song Spotify first.
B0047E9TRA|5.0|This movie duplicates what could happen and how people of any age can be so cruel. Karma comes back around.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Onxce again a great challenge..to solve the mystery befroe the end of the strory..and I did it!  Caught the one-liner that foreshadowd early on! Great job Mr. Grisham! You are a challenge to all of us former English teachers!
B00CHI5F5S|4.0|Not an Academy Award movie, but still worth the buy! Great action and good ending scene!! I recommend this as a weekend movie.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|What can I say. If you only know the HBO series ( which is magnificent ) you must go to the source material. Understand ahead of time that there will be differences, some large and dramatic, but let it go. Afterwards you can have lively discussions about the whys and wherefores of adaptation, but now give yourself over to the remarkable world George RR Martin created, and the compelling narrative.
B00009NQQO|1.0|So disappointed!  Tis seemed like such a good idea to keep our almost 2 year-old better entertained in the tub.  But, it doesn't stay on the tub  or shower walls and just falls down right away.  The suction cups appear to be cheap and flimsy.  Such a major bummer.  I don't recommend this, unless they correct the suction cup problem or come up with a better way to affix the product to the tub or shower walls.
1401238580|5.0|The mask is thin; but well detailed. My nephew thought it was an awesome addition to the graphic novel! He is 18 and a collector. Appropriate for most ages!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved it. I can't believe this is how it ended. Sylvia, I hope you are working on the next book in the series.
B009EAO38C|5.0|They blend pop and classical music into a joyous genre of their own.  My current favorite study music. Check out their YouTube videos.
B003O86FMW|5.0|great book, going to buy the next one real soon, cant wait to see how it ends!  my new fav!
B004QYTRRS|5.0|Randomly saw that a family member on facebook had watched this. I'm an obvious Johnny Depp fan - and the movie title also gained my attention seeing as I just went to Europe and had quite the storybook amarous experience. This movie helped me to feel that all over again. Not to mention the Muse song at the track just pulls the heart strings even more thanks! ;p<br /><br />Anyway - getting to the point... Good mix of comedy/romance and action.. Would watch again.
B00CHCUR9I|5.0|...the spontaneity, belief, and emotional depth of the show's actors, and the bold, innovative realism of the show's writers. The essentials are apparent in the comic that here was an entirely different kind of winner, knowing that film and television adapt in a far greater margin than not, and nearly half the licenses and franchises, with phenomenal standing as such, come from graphic stories media. Graphics storytelling is now respectfully taught in college and university literature, and philosophy of art and literature courses, as well as creative writing and art design courses. Once upon a time our government put such on trial, in order to protect the kids. Today, zombie messes raging are the ticket to making tomorrow's leaders think about how well man will hold together in the face of potential wars or ecomic disasters we are on the verge of. Who will be our Rick, Darrel, Carl, Herschel, Michone, Maggie, and on and on? Will we think and battle with, and over, the wrong ends of ourselves, or will we overcome? College's creative courses, as well as the media, know that the kids of today, being creatively concerned, will make for better leaders. They certainly won't put the essentials of expression -- a Divine process as the properly moral and sensibly protective know -- on trial. They'll put its power to the test against all that we truly will need to defend ourselves of... -- Tom Lee...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My young kids enjoyed &quot;helping&quot; me.  It was difficult for my kids, but they had fun.  It's like playing hide and seek.  I guess you won't like it if you don't like looking for things.
B003MXGNX0|5.0|You would have never know this was being streamed and not being played off a Bluray. The rental was so easy with 1click and the App on the PS3 was very easy to use.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I found some of the challenges easy and entertaining.  My 11yr old twins loved them. Only wish they had more levels.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game progressively challenging only drawback is the game only has 10 levels! Worked great on my kindle fire hd.
B004SUDQE0|5.0|Great actors. Besides Hugh Grant, Ian McNeice is in this film too. (He is Burt Large in the Doc Martin series). Just Great.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a Great series, I can't get enough!  Looking forward to season 4! Great characters, storyline, and historically accurate.
B00821OX98|5.0|Fun series, enjoyed catching up to the current season. Action, romance, and fantasy a nice mix of it all. Watched in two days.
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|Beautifully written, but a tad disappointing.  did not live up to my expectations, preferred the previous two novels. story seemed a little disjointed
B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|A lot of things have already been written about this new album.<br />As a fan of him, i really enjoyed it
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game tests your skills of observation and problem solving.  None of the rooms has the same puzzles. I hope there are a hundred levels.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Recommend highly, Easier to use than I expected, and I almost win every time I play it. Like the Tips feature and hardly play a winning round without it.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Well written, well played well recorded. Queensryche is back! The songs are interesting and you have to listen a few times to let the story in each song unfold. The CD sounds great in headphones and cranked.
B0081L391C|5.0|This movie is hilarious, its so fun to watch with a group of friends, or have it on as background noise. Its hilarious and everythign you expect from the two leads
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Although I'm tired of starting series that are yet unfinished, this book was enjoyable and satisfying by itself.  In other words, don't wait for the series to be finished before you start.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|First time playing a game like this. I usually play hidden object games. This was challenging and fun. Bring on more levels!!!
B0064MPXFA|1.0|It's not horrible but the writing and far left wing views constantly being pushed make it not worthy of watching.  Just write a good show without shoving your demented political views on us.
B00CEJ2H6K|5.0|GET THE SPECIAL EDITION. The extra disc is an EP where they play four original songs in the styles of Judas Priest, Black Sabbath, Motorhead and AC/DC, and those songs a great. More than the extra stuff, this album is killer. Fast, melodic and just perfect. I was already expecting a lot from this, but it blew away all my expectations. As fan of Amon Amarth, metal and good musicianship, this album leaves nothing to be desired.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Very well written and interesting work. Steve Jobs was an iconic character who many folks loved to hate or followed with a great passion yet was quite human. I found the book inspirational.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|And the plot thickens...I can't get enough of this series. The characters, the story lines...they keep you guessing and pull you in!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome Game. Was a bit tough but its a great puzzle game for when you're bored.<br />Its actually better than all the other puzzled games and it was a plus that it was free.
B00D7NRHX0|3.0|The story wasn't all that good.  Well, the basic story line was ok but I don't think the writing of how the story was told was very good.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is good for you if you love horses or unicorns. To groom them or train them and even enter compations for prizes don't let me forget about the ZEBRAS they are awesome!!&iexcl;!!!!&iquest;
B00BHBBSZ2|2.0|A bit hard to use. Needs more complete instructions. Not quite there yet...it is a grea idea. Just needs to be more user friendly.
B003WE9TU8|5.0|I enjoyed this book. There were lots of small, heartfelt, human stories all tied together within the larger story, Great!
B009V3KKXY|4.0|Great pictures that really help with more complex knots and falls.<br />Too few knots for a book about knots. Would have expected more.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Did not expect to like this book but I ended up loving it. So easy to read but so good
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think that my horse is a amazing game!If u r a horse lover this game is totally for u!! It's full of fun and u can play hours of it and not get bored!
B00CL50LEC|2.0|This is a bad love story for middle school girls...I was hoping that it was going to be a bad zombie movie w/ a lot of laughs...Nope...I just wish I could get my money back...
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The books were all good and suspensful.  However, I got tired of reading about their sexlife over and over again.  Besides that I really enjoyed reading these books.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Held your attention good and was nice variation to show a personal family side to the 16th President if the United States.
B008M721MS|5.0|This is great for communicating with my mother in law. She means the world to my husband and I. Try it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|An app for all those who like deduction games. A simple, but well executed puzzle. Highly<br />recommended for everyone. Go and get it now.
B00932A4XE|3.0|I managed to watch the whole thing, but wasn't really impressed. I didn't see much humor, and most of it was pretty dumb.
B000062YAY|5.0|Cool 2-CD set of live Slayer. A must have for your collection. The engineers and producers did a great job of capturing the live Slayer sound.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|goood app buut it takes gems for alot of the clothing but  is a pretty good app and i woul recomend it and it was free
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This is one of my kids favorite movies. It is sweet message and funny! Great family movie that everyone will enjoy!
1594487154|1.0|I have read countless books on leadership and sales effectiveness.  While this may a have a couple good ideas sprinkled among 236 pages...I only marked 2 pages for future reference and by the time I reached the end...it's the only book I have ever literally placed in the garbage can vs giving to someone else.  It's simply an \\"assembly\\" of ad-hoc experiences, thoughts, opinions, and research.
0553582038|5.0|I read A Storm of Swords two years ago and finally decided to pick this up, despite reviewers saying this book was bad, or at least not nearly as good as the first three books. I agree that this is the worst of the first four books, but I still think it is absolutely wonderful, and giving this book less than 5 stars simply because it isn't as good as the first four is asinine.<br /><br />It seems most reviewers are peeved about some things that, in my mind, are irrelevant to the quality of the book:<br /><br />1. It took GRRM 5 years to write and publish this.<br /><br />True and aggravating, but that has nothing to do with how good the book is.<br /><br />2. Many lovable characters are not featured in the book.<br /><br />True again, but that doesn't mean this book is \\"bad.\\" It may be worse than the other books because these characters were the most enjoyable to follow, but I actually think GRRM does a superb job telling the tales of the characters featured in this book (those characters in King's Landing, the Iron Islands, and Dorne).<br /><br />3. The pace of the book is slower than previous books.<br /><br />Yes, but the writing quality is top notch. Moreover, quite a bit happens in this book. The plot advances significantly. In the last 200 pages, the plot moved as quickly as any other book. Assuming that GRRM lives to complete the series, I am delighted that he has chosen to flesh out the world as much as he has. Our lack of patience regarding the production of new novels is irrelevant in evaluating the quality of this particular novel.<br /><br />4. GRRM has introduced a ton of new characters.<br /><br />I am personally pleased that GRRM has chosen to expand the cast. The world he has created is so fantastic and immersive. Most of the new characters he has introduced have dynamic and unique personalities, each despicable or lovable in his/her own way. While this book was a bit overwhelming at times with all of the characters' names, the future books will be incredible as we see these characters' story arcs climax and as some of them are killed off.<br /><br />If the series was completed, I doubt people would be criticizing this book for being bad. Its plot is masterful, and the quality of writing is superb. I read 400 pages in the last two days. I was enthralled by the book and could not put it down, and am now incredibly optimistic about the series' future. Here's to hoping we see A Winds With Winter soon!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game for kids all ages ! It feels like your taking care of a real life hoarse ! You should buy it ! Awesome game!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|El James too took this character and made him a person so deep but so lovable at the same. Hope she write more
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I have really enjoyed playing this game.  The colors are very vibrant. I would recommend this game to others. Fun
B001HN6922|5.0|3 year old grandson already had a copy of this movie but decided chewing it would be fine. this was a replacement...no chewing.
B007EC27QM|5.0|This is the best mobile Calculator app I've used.  I currently have it running on my Kindle Fire HD and will buy another copy to run on my webOS system as soon as the Android Compatability Layer for webOS is release this September.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I love that I can stream what I want to watch whenever I like with Prime. When you don't have TV services, this is a great option. And I get other perks as well with Prime. Too bad Season 4 of Downton Abbey isn't out yet.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I really liked this book.  It kept me intrigued t h e whole way through.there were several incidents in this book you don't see coming which keeps it interesting
0525478817|5.0|This book is amazing, really well written. Some of it can be a bit hard to understand and requires reading it slowly, but overall it's excellent. John Green is a terrific writer. The package itself arrived on time and in perfect condition.
B007NYPWS6|5.0|I was never bored with this movie, it held my attention through the whole thing and I never wanted it to end. These four actors were amazing, arguments and spats never ending always changing and different sides being taken from one argument to the next. Loved how it was all about the acting and conversation, all taking place in one tiny apartment, no action, explosions or camera tricks needed just raw brilliance.Would love to see on Broadway.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is very addicting. The new update is so hard at times. Tip wait till the pillars fall to jump.
B00DF0POXA|5.0|An aggressive, brutal and brilliant delivery! Yeezus is a masterful and scathing articulation of the world through the eyes of one of the most gifted artists of our time.
B000TU16GS|5.0|This a very good book for people like spies and want to know more about what Alex will do next
B0084I2PEO|5.0|Excellent, excellent book! The story is extremely engaging from the beginning of the book and the way it is told is very well. It keeps you gripped till the end. I loved the short chapters. It gives an insight into Afghanistan life, culture, customs and the country itself during the 80's, 90's. I have also just read The Kite Runner and cannot decide which I liked more but this story I related to and enjoyed more. Please read this book, you will love it.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Never got get.  Check my Kindle daily and still hasn't down loaded.  May be because I paid coins with it.
B00AKO93JK|5.0|Gives you so much variety.<br />Videos work great and easy to use.<br />Showed my girl friend this app and that alone had her download the appstore
B0054R6BFM|4.0|I liked the book, I wish it gave more drama because I'm a dramatic person, but it was great really shows what goes on in high school and how nice you just have to be to everyone because you don't know what they're going through.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Well done, great effects, a lot of fun, what else can I say?  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and recommend to all.
B000H6SXMY|2.0|As a consumer, one would think that a company like Amazon would fully disclose the &#34;used&#34; condition.  This full set contains damaged episodes.  Episodes that are right on the first disc, not one buried in the later sets. Gave it to my daughter as a gift, and she cannot fully enjoy it.  Shouldn't someone review these before selling them...I will not trust Amazon for used items in the future.  Buyer beware.
B00B2166BS|5.0|It also seems to charge faster than the standard cable. I like that I'm not wearing out the USB port every time I use the cable.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run is a really addictive and funny game to play. This is why I would rate this game a 5 star product.lawl
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This game is unpretentious. It is what it is, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I have played a number of Magic-related games, and this is a clean, well-constructed ride from start to finish
1878424319|5.0|good book, good read.......I need 16 more words so I guess I will keep on typing a bit more k?
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this. it. is a very fun game I play it every day. some time's. it is hard but I make it throught it
B00992CF6W|5.0|I THINK THAT THIS IS A WONDERFUL GAME FOR KIDS. I THINK THIS BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO USE THEIR IMAGINATION WHICH I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT.  SO THANKS FOR MAKING THIS GAME
B00CWVA3SE|5.0|I think this one movie in a long time i have been able to sit down and enjoy a movie<br />with my grand kids around.
B0062QRTKA|5.0|I like this game, worth the price. Fun to play, I don't care about the religious connection, adds a nice theme to the story. Graphics are nice and refreshing. Sound is good too. Visuals seems to run at a slow frame rate, even on my Galaxy S4, but it's not a big deal. Controlling the waters is very well done. I highly recommend this game to anyone who has a few minutes to play a quick level, or spend hours trying to get 3 stars for each level. Fun &amp; satisfying game.
B009S6ZKSO|5.0|Great collection of her most popular songs plus love her new hits and great country duet with Vince Gill also great live addition of beautiful disaster
B00ADS98FC|5.0|our children rented it so many times we ended up buying it. The music is catchy and fun. The harmonies are amazing and the humor....<br />It seems that each time we watch it we catch another line.<br />There are a few places I thought inappropriate for very young audiences but the music really overtakes those few places.<br />On our last road trip we decided to get the soundtrack as the girls keep singing songs from the movie!!
B00C1GBOU6|5.0|A fantastic return to form. I've enjoyed all of Sigur Ros' albums through the years, but this one feels so much  coser to the Sigur Ros sounds that got me into the band in the first place.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the band you'll enjoy the album. If you like a more rock oriented slant to your post-rock and somehow haven't heard of them, give it a go.<br /><br />Also, kudos to Amazon for the Instant Rip functionality. Being able to listen to the MP3 version of the album immediately while waiting for my physical copy was great.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Thanks for releasing this on the kindle fire, it made my day. . .does this mean KR 2 will be on the fire as well?
B009K0P10K|5.0|Couldn't take my eyes off of the tv for days!! Can't wait to be glued to my seat for season 3
B00CF34B2I|2.0|All the other platforms have online multiplayer, but not Android. This is a very important part of the game, making this app worthless, compared. Still they charge the same. Very bad. The program itself is great, way better than expected. Much faster,smoother and more intuitive than the 2013 Xbox version.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was a great game for grown ups, I loved it but ended to soon. More rooms please please want to an excuse to pinch then kids kindle
B000FC0O7M|4.0|I lived through the Gemini and Apollo era as a kid and remember Gene Kranz at the console in Houston.  It's really great to read about all the behind the things that went on.  I'm amazed with the lack of technology how they pulled off all they did without more major failures.  A testament to a time when the US was tops in technology and personal pride!!
B0042X9L6A|5.0|This is a very versatile flash. Well worth the price. Don't know how I did without it. I can't wait to get the chance to use it off camera.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|Probably my least favorite of the Die Hard's, but a worthy sequel, and it was fun to watch. The big climax at the end was pretty intense and cool. The bad guys in this one weren't nearly as well done as in the rest, but at least they didn't try to sell us something as bad as the scene in Live Free or Die Hard where John was trying to out-run a fighter jet in a semi-truck.
B00DC7NNAC|2.0|Slow paced for most of the movie. James Franco as Oz did not have great character development. Comparws to the original missing the magic. Special effects were good.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|I enjoyed this story right away.  It is very well written. Life in<br />India is extremely interesting and very difficult for  women.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Love this book. Like all of the Harry Bosch novels, this one is sooooooo good!<br />Harry, of course, doesn't exactly follow all the rules. He butts heads with authority<br />figures, true to his personality. You won't be surprised as this is vintage Harry. But<br />you will be riveted.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is just hard enough without being frustrating. addicting and fun.<br /> Give it a try. You will enjoy it.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is a story about a tragic accident that makes it very real  and  very moving.  I enjoyed reading this book very much.
B007N31Z06|5.0|This is a classic!  I really love the ending where they tell what each of the charactor's went on to become.
B0057VDGNK|5.0|Some retro sounds mixed with Martinez's genius, this soundtrack has a lot to do with why I liked the movie so much!
B000GCFG7E|5.0|As usual, there is excellent character development.  I always enjoy the side-swiping humor that Jack Reacher throws at us throughout the book.
B005TBQS0Q|5.0|I wasn't in country when Adrian was there, nor was I anywhere near Siagon but I sure remember the music.  Love Robin Williams!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really liked this game. Challenging enough to keep you busy,  but not so hard that you give up before finishing.
B009G78EE2|4.0|I knew I liked the first 3 releases, but found the entire album to be great. I listened to it over and over on my ten hour road trip and it never got old.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|This  is a good game and very habit formimg..time just runs away from you when you play..I like it, I would tell all to play.
B0026IUXO2|5.0|When the movie first came out I watched it may times to get all the history and the people involved.  Fascinating!
1595826971|5.0|husband loved the graphics game play for me due to camera angle was a bit to get use too but all together a great game
B0038NN3B4|5.0|A perfect complement to The Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Living. A little less science but still informative with many references. More meal ideas and schedules for different types of &#34;eaters&#34; in this book. There is plans for vegetarians and vegans too!
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|From X2 to the end, the way it starts, the feeling, the depth, everything. This sounds like the Real Deal.<br />Geoff Tate took the spirit, the feeling of the band and most importantly the fans.<br />The 3 original members decided to fire him, yet he doesn't accept it and he still can't be classy about it. He made a quick album with no depth and remade the old classics horribly for what? All he gained was the hatred of the old fans.<br /><br />Now Todd is a classy, great guy, who fits with the name Queensryche. Just listen to \\"A World Without\\" you will know what I mean, it's just like Promised land.<br /><br />Buy it and support the real deal.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|... I would give it if I could! Wicked challenging and entertaining, with outstanding graphics and great storyline.  Can't wait to play Enigmatis 2!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I can not give this movie high enough praise!  At first, I was thinking, are they going to sing through the whole thing???  After a short time, you get so wrapped up in it that you forget they are singing their lines.  Excellent story of values you don't often see these days.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Reading this novel was like watching a train wreck.  You find it repelling but continue to watch.  You start out thinking one way about the main characters and then totally changing your opinion of them.  In the end, they deserve each other.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|I have read this book several times over the years and I downloaded onto my Kindle.  It can be read over and over.  I am not a big vonnegut fan, but this, to me, is his classic.
B0086449YA|5.0|Mark just keeps coming back.  I was a teen in the mid 80's at Astroworld waiting in line for the XLR8 roller coaster when I first heard &#34;Money for Nothing&#34;.  The line for the ride was right behind the Southern Star Amphitheater and I got to hear a great deal of the concert.  I've been hooked ever since.  His style and genre has changed over the years, evolving with my aging tastes.  This album is no disappointment.  Mark is truly a great guitarist.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Grisham's books are becoming somewhat formulaic, but enjoyed the concept of the little guy against the big firms.  I found the information of how drug companies get drugs to market a little frightening and wonder how much of that is true.  Scary tactics.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I loved this movie! It's funny for all age groups and I can't wait to see the second one :)
B0050DIWFC|3.0|The book was okay...I just felt there was a lot of filler, just too wordy. If you don't like a book to move along, this is for you!
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|One of the worst movies I've seen! The only funny parts are the clips you see on the trailers. I wouldn't rent this one again!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|good to play when u have no Internet access. just wished that it had check points but then u wouldn't b wasting so much time cause when u die u have to start all over
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Certainly and Oscar-Worthy film by one of our best directors, Ang Lee. Beautifully photographed by Claudio Miranda and while the Blu-ray version is breathtaking, the 3-D must be seen. It is probably the best use of that photographic novelty since AVATAR, though this is a far different kind of film. I will say nothing more, so I don't spoil it for you. Experience it for yourself...and in 3D, it is an EXPERIENCE.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Fun game to play... play it every day... wish they hadn't limited the gifts you could accept...still love it though
B00CKQ1092|5.0|Dillinger never ceases to amaze. They keep innovating and progressing the genre. 5 stars for this groundbreaking album. Hope they continue to release material like this.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|David is great at playing the Dr. Donna not to bad and keeps the dr in line....mostly! A must watch!
B00985E3UG|5.0|Don't buy this processed food stuff. Supply and demand -- it would go away.<br /><br />Much as the anti-smoking efforts of the government and the American Cancer Society have cut into the number and percentages of smokers, a similar effort should be mounted against empty calories and obesity.
B007IX383I|5.0|Let me just say, I've bought a lot of CDs. Over the years, I've bought so many I can't even remember who they were from.<br /><br />I've also bought a lot of MP3 albums.<br /><br />In all that time, I've never - really - reviewed an album. I just let other people, more articulate about their love of music, do that.<br /><br />But I need to speak out about this album. I have to. There's someone with a gun (metaphorically, at least) telling me to do it.<br /><br />First off, this is, without a doubt, one of my favorite albums now. Ever. It's simply an unstoppable powerhouse of emotion from beginning to end. The band said they wanted to provoke emotions in the listener with this album and they have. I felt my emotions being tugged and prodded and explored with every sailing guitar, every melody, every incredible height Lee Douglas' voice soared to.<br /><br />This album is uplifting and depressing. It wants to be. Its goal is to drill down on the sadness in life and show you how to emerge from it.<br /><br />After listening to it multiple times you truly understand the name of the album - every human's life is a series of climatic shifts.<br /><br />Personally, I'm going through a rough time in my life. This album has given me energy to persevere through it. That's because it's more than just a series of catchy tunes strung together; tons of bands do that. Its an ongoing journey of the mind and heart.<br /><br />More technically, the 2-part 'Untouchable' is a roller-coaster of emotion and power. Vincent is so much better, and clearer, than he has been on past releases. He manages to sound reserved and introspective at exactly the right moment, complimented by the expertly handled guitar work.<br /><br />That's basically the entire album, though I think it's best represented in those two songs. I will say I wasn't crazy about track #6 - it sounded a little too industrial for my tastes. But it was still great.<br /><br />What else can I say? I loved this album. For the price, I highly recommend you pick it up and try it out. Maybe it will impact you as much as it has me.
B005HSL626|3.0|My great-granddaughter likes this; she is almost 7 years old.  I do not play it, but keep it for her to use.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book trilogy was great! Loved it, very entertaining. I would recommend it to anyone to likes hot spicy romance.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I loved the first two books and was excited to continue Eva and Gideon's love story.  I did enjoy certain aspects of this book but feel the author let us down in many ways. The story seems rushed and void of any meaningful plot.  The ending just leaves you hanging.  I am disappointed and feel the publisher and author betrayed their loyal fans.  I am not sure I will spend any more time AND MONEY reading about these lovers.  Too bad for all of us.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I play Mahjong on the computer and it is much more challenging.  However, I still play this from time to time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a wonderful little game. Anyone that loves horses or animals in general will like this game. Great for kids too.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|And the Mountains Echoed is a haunting book about life in Afghanistan. It tells of family ties & war & connections between generations. It kept my interest. I rate it among the best books I have read in recent years. It tells of the human condition, in the best sense.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Despite the somewhat depressing subject matter, I enjoyed this book. It was rather typical of a Jodi Picoult novel. Worth a read.
B00BI73CVI|3.0|I loved the Broadway play... the movie was ok. I cant really explain more than that. It just landed a bit flat for me.
B003JH8LPW|4.0|Right out of today's headlines, this novel shows other ways the NSA can be exploited.  Sometimes the plot gets murky in an attempt to confuse the good and the bad for the reader.
0307592731|5.0|This book is a great read & had me laughing out loud numerous times. Very emotional, and written so well that you can almost see the scenery as she describes.
B002O2THRO|5.0|It was long but I thought it was a much better movie than the new movie that just came out.  Worth watching again.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|i dont like how you have to rate to keep going on the game but awesome game I like it better than most
B003V1WTMM|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. This is a read-in-bed-way-past-when-you-should-have-gone-to-sleep-because-you-can't-put-it-down book. The author really pulled me in and made me fall in love with the characters, the mysteries and the entire world. So clever and funny for such a dark story. I'm a new Kate Morton fan with this book!
B003SI605K|3.0|It was ok but not great.  Character study on different Chinese generations.  Mother/Daughter, old world / new world also.  A little long.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Gideon and Eva's story is heartbreaking while being erotic and romantic all wrapped up together! I just can't get enough!!
B005ZCXPP0|1.0|Simply the move is so shallow. Someone somehow magically boosted his muscle and physical strength, so he can abuse the law of physics and do crazy shit and survive no matter whatsoever. The evil ones just can't do anything but being beaten up. The movie is about a man, with his cold war weapon and muscle kills 1000 people with lasser guns. Dumbest super hero movie I have ever seen.
B009VL2AD4|3.0|This album has so many of the right ingredients but for me it's one that doesn't quite hit the mark. The music began to push all the right buttons but left me feeling slightly unsatisfied by the end of most of the tracks. A bit like the experience of watching a movie that grips you during the first half and then fails to maintain all of your interest the whole way through. I don't regret getting it, Binki Shapiro's gorgeous vocals make it well worthwhile if you're a fan. The obvious sixties influence isn't just heard in the music but is also evident in the extremely short playing time! Less than a half hour. Though sometimes this is good when you want to play some music and hear the whole album with limited time on your hands! Definitely not a complete disappointment. Stand-out track for me; Casanova.
0312360258|3.0|Let's get the negatives out of the way, since I feel that will go on longer. My first major issue with this book is the writing style. Zoey can say/think some pretty vulgar words.... And yet, she still says words like \\"poopie\\" & giggles at the word \\"boob\\"? She's supposed to be in high school, grow up. It's not even the character I dislike. It's not Zoey's fault that her vernacular wasn't written cohesively. The word \\"ho\\" is used more times than necessary, & it makes this book come off as really immature. Mixed with the over usage of parenthesis that only distracted from the plot at hand, it just wasn't very well executed as a whole.<br /><br />Then there's the abundance of pop culture references. A few? Fine. But this was excessive. All it does, in my opinion, is sound like an attempt to prove to the reader that \\"I'm hip, look, Zoey likes hip things\\". And that's great... Until time moves on. Celebrities & movies aren't topical forever, & in the end the references only date the book.<br /><br />My last major flaw in this book is the negative stereotypes. Emos, goths, & \\"dorks\\" are all dissed, even if only gently. It adds to the immature tone of Marked. By the by, watching Star Wars or Indiana Jones doesn't make you a dork. It means you have taste. I understand they're not everyone's forte, but there's a reason why they've made millions of dollars- people enjoy them.<br /><br />With all that being said, I do have some positives to say.<br /><br />Overall, I like the concept & plot of this novel. House of Night sounds like a pretty awesome school that I'd like to visit. I like the mythological aspects with tones of paganism, and I found the characters both well described & relatable. I probably will read book two, I do want to know what happens next. But I'm reading forward with the severe hope & prayer that the speech/writing is stepped up.<br /><br />I give this a weak three stars. Don't go out of your way to buy it. If you're wanting Shakespearean speech, don't buy it. But if it's in your house or you really have a vampire obsession, then maybe check it outit.

0345803485|4.0|This review contains swears. Be warned. Don't like it? Don't read.<br /><br />Oh dear. Where should I begin?<br /><br />Christian Grey is a hardworking, arrogant CEO who enjoys control in every aspect of his life. Ana is a naive college student. When Ana must interview Christian for her school newspaper, it sparks a life that she could have never imagined, including horrible mood swings, bondage, punishment, and submission. But is Christian what Ana wants, and is Ana what Christian truly needs?<br /><br />---<br /><br />So, I know people love and hate this book. I give my own opinion alone, and I hope that you respect it, as I respect yours.<br /><br />First, the negatives.<br /><br />- Ana's use of the phrases oh my/holy cow/damn. I understand that she's supposed to be innocent, but it's tiring after awhile<br /><br />- Use of the words murmured/muttered/breathed. Again, I understand the need for intimate words, but, these were used all the time. I'm pretty sure no one ever spoke at full volume.<br /><br />- Kate. So, she's worried about her best friend Ana being in an abusive relationship. So what does she do? Purposely riles him up and angers him. That's friendship, right there. Letting the abuser get angry so, what, he could beat the s*** out of your friend so you can be proven right? Please.<br /><br />- The constant lip biting of Ana. If she bit her lip that much, it would be rough and bloody, and no one would ever want to kiss her.<br /><br />- The actual \\"scenes\\" in the playroom. I don't think this book deserves the scandal. Is it sexy? Definitely. I don't deny that. But, as a member of this subculture, I was disappointed. This BDSM was rather vanilla for me. It makes me a bit concerned about my own definition of \\"normal\\", and sad for those who truly do have vanilla sex lives.<br /><br />With all that being said, there are positives.<br /><br />+ Use of the word \\"there\\". I've seen a lot of complaints about it, but would you rather just hear p---- or vagina constantly?

B003V5CFV8|4.0|This movie is very off-beat and funny.  Shared it with my 16 yr. old grandson because I think it is a classic.  The cast is great.  It also has one of the best sound tracks ever.
141690977X|2.0|This is a self-help book for women that includes short stories on various man problems. The author offers help and tips on how to deal with it, with most of them involving the women telling her man to take a hike.<br /><br />--<br /><br />I don't have much of a review for this one- there's not much to say. I honestly don't understand all of the hype that surrounded this when it came out. This book is pretty much common sense. It takes you through a series of stories where the author pretty much just rephrases the same advice each time. I would have given it one star, but admittedly a few of his lines did make me laugh, so I guess it wasn't a complete waste of time. It's a fast read, but I don't really recommend it for any woman who actually needs dating advice.

1451696191|5.0|I cannot begin to explain this book and how I feel about it. It has been a favorite for a long time, and I first read it in junior high. I'm in college now, and I thought it was time to reread it (especially with the movie coming out), and perhaps see if I had outgrown it. I'm glad to say, I didn't. I've only taken more away from it. I think everyone needs to read this book, and I sincerely hope that you love it as much as I do. I cannot recommend it enough.<br /><br />It's detailed and emotionally charged. I found myself both laughing with Charlie and crying with him. Old stories from my own high school days were conjured up, and I couldn't help but to look back at my memories and look at them in a new light, when seen with his tone in mind.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|pretty cool game fun most the time but i would strongly encourage everyone to get clash of clans have fun and try the game
B00475AYJQ|5.0|A flat out great story.  I couldn't get enough, and hated to see it end.  Now the third book really needs to come out.  Highly recommend this one.  It doesn't even matter if you don't think you'd like the subject (fantasy).  It's so well written with great characters, hilarious moments, and awful tragedies you will not be disappointed.  I actually feel like I'm wiser after reading this book series.
0439023521|5.0|I loved this book.<br /><br />I finally caved into the pressure of the hype, since everyone is obsessed with the film's release. I figured that it wouldn't do any harm to give this book a shot, despite my usual disappointment with overly publicized books.<br /><br />With all that said, I couldn't put this down. I quickly found myself emotionally invested in certain characters, cheering for them to survive. I loved that Katniss had no real romance triangle like so many YA books do lately. I loved the amount of violence and action that had my heart racing. I loved the overwhelming sense of sadness and haunting that carried through this novel. Did I mention that I loved this book?<br /><br />The book ended too quickly, but I am eager to read the next installment of this enthralling story.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|The characters don't really look like people some are just ugly<br />The characters make kinda weird faces and noises but overall the games really fun recommended for children and maybe some adults
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Simply a great read.  I don't care what genre you prefer.  This series does not disappoint.  Four more words required.
0545123275|5.0|It's been a long time since I've read a werewolf book without vampires. It was a much needed break.<br /><br />Grace is a girl who has an obsession with wolves. Well, one wolf in particular, one that hangs around the woods in her yard, the one with yellow eyes. He only comes around in the winter, & she lives for those cold days where she can see him. But then she meets a boy with the same familiar, sad eyes. Grace will have to face the truth about this boy, Sam, his past, her fascination with wolves, herself, & a wolf attack on a jock from her school that mirrors a memory from her own past.<br /><br />I loved this book. It's an easy to read young adult novel that tells an enjoyable story. I fell in love with Sam as Grace did, though I related more to him than I did to her. I'm glad I gave this a try, & I'm definitely going to be reading the next in the series.<br /><br />I recommend it for young adults & fans of the YA genre. If you're looking for a violent, horror-like wolf story, this is not for you.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|happy happy happy loved it kept me thinking just couldn't put it down.took the game svddy where I went so I keep on figuring it out bated it when I couldn't play it but ablative breaks at work.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Love them and will watch all of these series. great acting and rich story line and very interesting and catchy!!!
044024238X|4.0|Oh, Sophie Kinsella, will I ever tire of your books?<br /><br />No?<br /><br />I didn't think so either.<br /><br />The Undomestic Goddess is the story of Samantha Sweeting, a true work addict. She's one of the best & youngest lawyers, & is up for a partnership at the firm where she works. She \\"thrives\\" under pressure, just like her pushy lawyer mother (but not her brother, who had a melt down, but, let's not talk about that). It's the day that she finds out if she makes partner- but she notices a form on her desk. One she's ignored. It's a huge, rookie mistake, one that'll get her fired....<br /><br />So she runs for it, taking a train to anywhere but London. She gets off in a daze, & goes up to a house, wanting a simple glass of water. But they think she's there to be their housekeeper. She's a trained lawyer, but maybe this is just the break she needs....<br /><br />This book is a lovely blend of tragedy, love, & humor. It's a quick, fun read that all chick-lit fans should check out.
6305428042|5.0|This is a favorite movie of my soon-to-be daughter-in-law and I bought it for a Christmas gift. We watch it every Halloween!!
0385342071|5.0|I won a copy of this through Goodreads First-Reads, and I couldn't have been more excited. I'm a big fan of Kinsella's work, and her latest novel, I've Got Your Number, did not disappoint.<br /><br />Physiotherapist Poppy Wyatt is the star of this story, and I find her completely relatable. At the beginning of the story, she's in a panic- she's lost her engagement ring, a priceless family heirloom. It's simply gone, without a trace. And to make matters worse, someone comes along and steals her phone. Upset and desperate, a silver lining appears. There, in the trash bin, lies a cell phone. After a brief discussion with herself, she picks it up and quickly learns that it once belonged to businessman Sam Roxton's personal assistant.<br /><br />Through a series of circumstances, Sam allows her to \\"borrow\\" the phone for a while, so that she may locate her ring. Plus, she needs to be in constant contact with her husband-to-be Magnus, and her next to useless wedding planner, Lucinda. But the ring is most important- Magnus' family consists of famed scholars, all of whom look down on Poppy (not to mention the marriage). What will they think of her now, once they find out that she is irresponsible in addition to not good enough for their son?<br /><br />Chaos, hilarity, drama, and romance all circle around her as she continues to read (and eventually forward, of course) Sam's personal messages. She intimately learns him, by getting this rare insight to his life. She never intended to read his messages, but it's a good thing she did- a few random texts that she didn't give much thought to may just save her new awkward text buddy's neck.<br /><br />Of course, will Poppy feel the same level of happiness, once Sam reads her own messages and sneaks into her personal life?<br /><br />I found this book to be charmingly awkward and hilarious. I couldn't put it down! With each turn of the page I found myself wondering what would happen next. I think this novel is a brilliant way of expressing modern romance, in the age of technology that most of us can't live without. I recommend this to any fan of chick lit, funny romances, or anyone who is as dependent on text messaging as I am!pressing modern romance, in the age of technology that most of us can't live without.

B00B4FU6KE|4.0|It was a little slow in the beginning, but once I got into it, I enjoyed it.  Interesting childhood perspective.
0307949486|5.0|The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo was recommended to me by a friend, and boy am I more than a little glad that I decided to give it a chance.<br /><br />Journalist Mikael Blomkvist finds himself tied up in a battle of words and articles with a financial mogul with hands that are far from clean. On a self-suggested sabbatical, he gets a phone call offering him a freelance job that for reasons he can't entirely explain, he can not turn down. Working for a former CEO of a once powerful company, he must solve a case that has been closed for decades in order to obtain information that could sink his financial mogul for good. Eventually paired up with the \\"socially incompetent\\" computer mastermind Lisbeth Salander, they find themselves in a heart racing investigation beyond either of their expectations.<br /><br />Not one for mysteries or crime novels, I was pleasantly surprised when I enjoyed this novel. It was hard for me to put down, and I grew to love Lisbeth and her tough, smart way of dealing with the problems she's dealt. I'll definitely be reading the next book in the series. I recommend it for those who like a good murder mystery.
B0091REZMW|3.0|it was not as good as I thought it would of been. some people might enjoy it. I guess I expected it to be better.
1250007208|5.0|Cinder is a retelling of the classing fairytale Cinderella. Set in the future, after the fourth World War, our Earthly society is one of both man and machine. Cinder is a cyborg, outcast because of it. Shes also a mechanic, and when Prince Kai comes to her booth for her expertise, she can't get him out of her head. Unfortunately when you're part machine, and the plague is killing people around you left and right, it's hard to stay positive. Add in the fact that Cinder has \\"special\\" blood and a looming war with the citizens of Luna, a colony on the moon, you have one helluva futuristic princess tale that's not what your mama read you.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Much to my surprise, I loved this book. After hearing so much hype, I was expecting to be disappointed. I'm very glad to be wrong. This story was vividly written and easy for me to imagine the story and surroundings. I felt part of the story, and though it was predictable (it is Cinderella, after all), I found myself rapidly turning the pages to see what happened next, and horrified when I ran out of book. I will definitely be investing in the sequel.<br /><br />I recommend it to fans of fairytales, YA, or cyborgs and intergalactic war.<br /><br />Thanks to Marissa Meyer and Jean Booknerd Blog for my copy.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I just love the game. it keeps you busy. and the best part is its free.  thank you for the free game.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Although the story may sound a bit like cheesy sci-fi (futuristic world government sends children to floating space-ship school to learn how to battle the invading alien bug species), this is definately worth a read! There's the surface children's story for anyone who wants the entertainment value, but there's also deep underlying philosophy about everything from politics to science and the meaning of life. I read these books years ago, and loved them as much as I do now! I only read the first of the ender series, because I was told the following books weren't as good as the shadow series. But I have read every other book by Orson Scott Card that I can get my hands on. He's an amazing writer with an amazing brain.
B001XUPH9K|3.0|Love the movie, but Amazon Prime is always slow loading.<br />if you pause to go to the bathroom, it doesnt hold your space.<br />you have to start at the beginning & fast forward

030759565X|5.0|As a self-diagnosed cookbook junkie, I have no shortage of foodie tomes lining multiple bookcases, but Smitten Kitchen is a standout for many reasons:<br /><br />1. The recipes work. I've made many of them from various categories and every one has been from very good to excellent.<br />2. The recipes are innovative.  No one with more than a handful of cookbooks needs another full of of the same ole, same ole.  To me, the value of a physical cookbook over internet searches is that a good one encourages perusing and being inspired to leap into the realm of what might not have been considered otherwise.<br />3. Lots of vegetarian options.<br />4. Photos that make the results look so wonderful I just have to make whatever it is, and I know when I do make it, it will taste as good as it looks (see #1).<br />5. I adore the stories.  It's like cooking with a good friend I've known for years.<br /><br />This is now in my top 20 all-time cookbooks and it shares that shelf space with some culinary giants.  I can't wait for volume 2!
B003WUYOQ6|4.0|The information is good, but there was way too much discussion on history and previous studies.  It seemed to take forever to get to main theme that carbs are the reason we get fat.<br /><br />There was a huge amount of WHY we get fat and a lot less of WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT. There was no detailed diet plan in the book.<br /><br />But all in all it was informative, after you slogged through the history.  In the end the author steers you towards the diet plans that focus on low carbs.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Sad that this book didnt rap up the series!  It dragged along with fluff and fillers, that were not intriguing at all.  I cant figure out where she's going with Eva's character.  I'm not liking Eva re-establishing a relationship with Brett - unless she feels vindicated because of Corinne???  Its a tit-for-tat game, that is quickly getting on the nerves of most readers. It appears Eva is cruising to hurt Cross before it's overwith.  I like a good mystery, but this is a romance and the characters are becoming confusing and unappealing - except for Cross! This series is my first read for Day and was on pins and needles to finish.  I drove all over town to get a copy! I had to re-read Reflected to refresh...Some Authors need to consider release dates to a series.  Its aggrivating to start reading them only to find out that publication dates have changed and you're waiting 6 months! Luckily, there are some authors that keep this in mind and they release all at the same time or within 30 days of each.<br /><br />I want to know the ending...just not sure I want to read the filler in between.

B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|Not in the same vein as other DP albums, but a great listen.  It serves as a very good driving album when you just want to zone out and let the miles roll by.  A couple future classics on this album as well.
B000HEVALC|5.0|Wouldn't it have been cool to sit in on a jam session with these iconic legends? Okay, since that's not possible, at least we have this recording.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I've never felt compelled to review a book before and really just wanted to share with other readers how much I loved it.  Completely original, never boring, the concept of the world as a magical place if you only let go and believe has me smiling softly to myself and wishing it didn't have to end. Thank you, Ms. Morgenstern, for this perfect escape from the everyday and I look forward to reading more of your work.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|I loved every moment of this film.  The music is still playing in my head.  The characters were delightful.  I would love to retire to a place like that if only I were a musician.

B0091REZMW|4.0|really great game.. it keeps u guessing and wanting to play more. luv this app will play again and again..
B009LDD5E0|1.0|This whole season was ruined for me. Not because of the new characters, who I actually semi enjoyed, but because the writers decided to focus on a character who sends a wrong message with every decision he makes. And not only that, but they destroyed two characters that I loved because of him. Tina has turned into a Blaine stan. Which is funny when I stop to think about it, because if that's really the case, then at least she's accurate. And Sam lost all respect and love the moment he told Blaine that Kurt was great and all, but too gay to show the school that a gay guy and a straight guy can be friends.<br /><br />Blaine just sucks. He's a horrible boyfriend (cheats and then blames Kurt for it), and has done NOTHING to show that he's remorseful for his actions. He's a horrible role model and the show needs to focus on someone else.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|Item arrived on time and as described, great movie to watch
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I loved this book.  I learned many things about North Korea I did not know.  The suffering of people with hunger and the lose of human dignity. The accounts are so personal.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|Very moving and dramatic, with great acting.  This is a musical, but even my friends who don't like musicals enjoyed this movie.  The message of redemption is the theme and basis of the story.  Not for young children as they depict the dredges of society doing what they do best.
B00B5ARKDE|4.0|A lot of people said don't buy because it's just Lego Batman 2's cutscenes with more added to it, but I didn't play the game so the movie was highly entertaining. The voice acting was also top notch, and I think the animation was was better than the new Lego movie coming to theaters. Definitely worth a buy for Lego and Batman fans
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I played a bit of persona 3 FES on the PS2, and really enjoyed it, and with my new PSVita I though that maybe I should buy the sequel. What a great choice! I'm close to finishing the game and it has been NON. STOP. FUN. The games story is great and there is a huge and satisfying amount of character development which you can partially control. Hundreds of different personas to battle with, and pretty much endless combinations within every aspect of the game! I live this game and would recommend it to anyone!<br /> This game takes a bit of skill to pick up on, but you learn fast. Almost every battle is different and you have to constantly figure out how to beat new foes. If you like rpg turn based strategy games, you won't be disappointed with Persona 4: Golden!
B008HK3XYK|5.0|I really like the Kindle Fire HD cover.  I only wish it would have the option of other color choices.
B00CWVGBEO|2.0|this was as bad as Arnold's early movies. It had good actors, but they where not used well. I would not recommend this movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is good fun and addictive but I love the game only I can't connect to Facebook but think that is just me so I think u should play it
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Not as good as it could have been.  The screen play lacked depth. The dircetor did not inspire the actors.
B00CUWWLWG|3.0|good game like the fight effects. There is so much to keep you busy. I'm not far enough to now if you can play with out friends.
B007JCP8FE|5.0|Great cd.  I listen to it all the time.  Bought the cd then bought it as instant download for my phone.  It always beig played.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|All the fun and thrills of the old Indiana Jones flicks!  Put on the popcorn, and escape for an evening of adventure.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Tells how it really was and the obstacles that must be overcome while serving your country. A true national hero.
B006VFLIYK|1.0|While the writing style and character development are good, the plot has too many WTF moments.<br />The logic about the bus and the restaurant shootings make no sense.  It made me think about not finishing the book (I rarely don't finish a book).  While I did read to the end, I was looking forward to being done with the book and reading something better.<br />Try Calico Joe or anything from Ken Follett for a far better reading experience.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|This is my first Jack Reacher novel. As a newbie, I found the plot only ok and the editing really lacking. Whole passages were repeated in subsequent chapters. It feels like a slap-dash effort. I will try others. But this was not a good start.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I've read most of Ken Follett's books.  He has written so many great ones.  His last 3 books - World Without End and the 2 from the Century Trilogy are superb and highly recommended.
B002LF2T4C|5.0|This movie not only perfectly captures the essence of the book, Johnny Depp also channels Dr. Thompson to a degree that is shockingly accurate. What is the American Dream? I don't know. But I'm sure I'm closer to it after this.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Great movie a good mix of comedy, action, and drama. Highly recommend for a good night's movie. Not for the kids though
B00821OX98|3.0|I'm hoping the series gets better over time as I've heard it will. I understand the first few episodes are to get the know he characters but for a dystopian future series I preferred Jericho. Certainly gives a good argument for 2nd amendment proponents for getting weapons into many hands. Don't think the aliens would care who or if the guns are registered though.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Not as good as full version but a nice application nonetheless. I don't use it often but when i do it does the job just fine til i get home.
0812982622|5.0|Johnson's novel is one of the best I've read in a long time! I'm astounded that some reviewers on this site are taken aback by the violence.  What do they expect in a novel about North Korea? Have they been propagandized by the Dear Leader also?  Anyway, you'll learn much about the culture and society from this novel (although much has to also be imagined because of the secretive nature of the regimes), and best of all, the novel ultimately is a statement about the human spirit's ability to endure unimaginable trials and obstacles.  I highly recommend this book, especially to intelligent readers who have paid attention to world events and are curious about North Korea.
B003BKZW40|5.0|I loved Long Walk.  The characters were believable as possible in an unbelievable situation, and within the confines of the long walk, Stephen King/Richman Bachman did a great job of creating interest and empathy with the characters.<br /><br />The Running Man was a nostalgic look at the time warp of the 70\s that it was written in.  How did we ever manage without the technology we have today)  Because the story is set &#34;in the future&#34; that is now, King's &#34;guess into the future&#34; is way of the mark, but added to the charm of the story.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|I didn't know anything about this movie (or book) before renting it, so I had a very low expectation of what it would be about.  By the end, I found the movie to be compelling and enjoyable on a variety of levels.  First, the photography (if that is what it really is these days) is stunning.  Watch this in HD... stunning!  Second, the story line is good... has a lot to it, if you take the time to think about what the movie/story is all about.  One could argue, it's a classic man vs. nature story... or, it's a story about religious preferences... or, it's a life story of &#34;letting go.&#34;  Or... that's the point - this story line works on a lot of levels.  So, if you enjoy movies that make you think, you'll probably find this entertaining and worthwhile.
B00026YO36|5.0|After hearing one of the tracks on one of my favorite TV shows, I bought the disc. The lyrics are of great feeling, the music both subtle and intense. You won't regret this cd.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|If you're a veteran you never saw combat this will make your service seem like Brownies.  At least it did for me.  I didn't understand or appreciate who CPO Chris Kyle was until reading this.  And as with the rest of the Americans not under obama's spell, I mourn his loss and know that our country is worse off without him.<br /><br />As a fan of WEB Griffin, Clancy and the like, this book kept me spellbound from the first page.  Most men who grew up idolizing their grandpa (and hearing stories about his military service), playing with GI Joe's and feeling that the Stars and Stripes meant more than just a colorful banner will be able to relate.<br /><br />Semper Fi
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Nice game to pass the time but not obsessive.  Sometimes you just need a little distraction. My granddaughter likes to help solve the escape routes.
B008M721MS|4.0|I can't remember if Skype came with my new Kindle HD or I downloaded it right after I got it, but whatever version it was it had no volume.

Third version is a charm.

0385349831|2.0|I would start off by noting that Amazon has this listed under science fiction. Perhaps a nod to the mysterious origins claimed for the manuscript, perhaps not (I also note that the science fiction club library at my alma mater had the Bible shelved under both \\"G\\" and \\"M\\").<br /><br />It's not uncommon for religious texts to claim mysterious provenance, and this one's origin conveniently provides for a Rabbi, an Imam, and a Priest, to act as a Greek chorus, for \\"the Copt,\\" a man of mysterious origins and broad platitudes. Why no Buddhist? Well, the setting is Jerusalem. Or maybe it would have just been redundant.<br /><br />I've seen some awfully written texts that nevertheless had transformative energy. This text isn't awfully written (just a touch bombastic). But I found no energy here. YMMV.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game really makes you think and that's the kind of games I really like it was a fun game can't wait for more levels
B00766CLPI|5.0|A wonderful choice of classical songs and, though Ms. Streisand is not a true classical singer, they are performed lovingly and beautifully.<br /><br />The sound quality, however, leaves much to be desired.  Most of the tracks sound muffled.  This is \\"remastered\\"??  I'd have thought they could do better.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the music is SO good, I'm unwilling to deduct a star for the less-than-stellar sound quality.  Bravo, Barbara!

B007BVOEPI|5.0|Game of Thrones offered many different plot lines that were easy to follow even if you never read the books for the series.  Usually I have one or two favorite characters, but for this show I cheered and cried for many of the characters.  Great show that kept my attention throughout the season and leaving me yearning for the next!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome brain game that puts your mind to the test! I can't wait for more levels to come. Can you escape?
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie, but it suprised me with how it kept you watching.  I was especially suprised at his conversations with God and the impact those had on the movie.
B0093QHWLC|5.0|I completely enjoyed watching this film.  The cast was superb--down to the tiniest role.  There were times that I had to pause the film to give myself a chance to breathe.  I thought about this intricate plot for days after seeing the film.  The best thing was--all  the clues were there.  The writer was extremely fair with the viewer.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I wanted to see this one before the Red2 came out and I am glad I did.  This was a very cute, entertaining movie.  Lots of action with comedy mixed in.  Definitely primed to see the second one now!
B000JMKNV0|4.0|Teddy's progression through this novel always keeps the reader guessing. The novel does a great job of allowing the reader the chance of figuring out the case along with the protagonist. Lehane does a fantastic job of giving the reader enough clues to start putting the case together without giving away the resolution.  Even with seeing the movie first, this novel and it's climax hit me like a ton of bricks.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|this game is great amazing fantastic in this game there is more than just making a zoo you can save the animals too
B003UYUR10|3.0|My kids and I liked the movie very much. It's a family friendly action movie with likable characters. Thumbs up.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Easy to use and makes quick work of trying to figure out a common denominator problem as well as double checking my son's math homework!
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|Fun action packed super hero movie that's not dark a depressing like the Batman movies are.<br />This is what super hero movies should be.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|This show was recommended to me by my daughter .  I had to call her and tell her how right she was about this show.<br />I loved it from the first moment of watching. Drama at it's best !!!
1423113497|5.0|Great series for younger readers, my son loved it. It was one of many serial books he got into after Harry Potter.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Absolutely love it!  Now, you need to get to work on getting Candy Crush Saga for the Kindle Tablet!  That would be AWESOME!!!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|U.S. film makers should follow suit and make this kind of product and forget all of those scripted &#34;reality&#34; shows.
0345529057|5.0|This set was a great price, it showed up quickly, and in excellent condition. A must have for fans of the TV series.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Very entertaining. Great time filler when having a wait. Had on first Kindle Fire &amp; now on my new Kindle HD. Great game.
B0070UFMOW|4.0|It is very portable, and provides a DAC, tone, balance, and volume controls in a unit that fits in your pocket.
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|it does the job like I said it works well and it is in my truck all the time fine
B005544V6A|5.0|Quite possibly the best scripted show I've seen...ever! Worth a sixth star for sure. Anyone with a thinking mind and a sense of humour will enjoy this show. I usually dont look at television but this an easy exception to my \\"rule\\"
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was not in love with it at first as the story unfolds very differently but then I couldn't put it down!  I was eager to read something that enthralling right away.....haven't found another one to equal it yet!
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|I haven't stop playing this EP since I bought it. I really hope Lorde goes main stream. The music industry could really use a breath of fresh. Love this album. it's genius.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This app is a lot of fun.  It is similar to 100 floors, but with more to do in each level. Being free you should definitely try it out.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great. There is always something that you can play. The possibilities are endless. Best virtual pet game ever.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|You have to love Jesse and you also have to hate him.<br />he is a bad boy you can't stay away from, even when you know you will get hurt.<br />You also have to love Ava and worry about her also, she knows she cant stay away from Jesse even tho she knows she is going to get hurt badly.She has some growing up to do and taking off her kid gloves will be a start.
0689835604|4.0|Bright, sturdy and baby loves lifting the flaps up to see what is beneath them! I would purchase more of Karen Katz books because the quality id great and the fun bright colors captivates baby's attention.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|I can never find books that can beat this series. This  is my second time reading  it and I've fallen in love with it all over again.
B00BQXWH2O|5.0|Once again, never disappointed with anything that comes from Armin!  Great album!  Some great trance tracks like the title track Intense and then some epic vocal tracks with some good lyrics!
B006OCM0G0|2.0|Very limited if you don't have anyone to connect to for the social side. No advancement. Needs more ways to move forward without help from others.
145210655X|4.0|I think there could have been a few better Star Wars references but cute book for children and Star Wars fans.
B002OSY2T6|3.0|MY BABY BOY LOVED IT AT FIRST ITS ALSO SOUND ACTIVED...ROLLS AROUND VERY CUTE..HE LOVES IT WHEN IT GOES WEEEEEEEE...BUT NOW HE DOESNT PAY TO MUCH MIND TO IT...KIND OF A WASTE OF MONEY FOR ME...BUT EVERY CHILD IS DIFFRENT I GUESS...ALSO WISH IT WAS A LITTLE CHEAPER...
B005QUQP76|5.0|First I'm a gamer by hobby,  I have bought several different gaming gear for my pc over the past 10+ years. (was a console gamer since i was 10)  The biggest thing about gaming is the controls, they matter in game and actual hardware, with consoles its the actual controller, which provides all the functions of the game in your hands.  With a PC its your keyboard and mouse, so they also have to work well in the game environment, that being said, this mouse is one of my favorites.  I have bought logitech, razer, and steel series mice, this was my first Corsair mouse, (i have a lot of their other products).  The user interface for adjusting the sensitivities and buttons, as well as the dpi levels is better than i expected, it works and is easy to manage.<br />The thing i like the most is probably the wheel, the solid clicks from scrolling are the best when gaming, as i have been in situations where with my razer mouse i would often scroll to far and end you fragged and tea bagged.  the buttons are easily clickable, and don't really see any improvements over anyone else.  Overall i would recommend this to my clanmates...<br /><br />pros:<br />easy user interface that works, the wheel with the little resistance so the scrolling is solid and defined, buttons are on par with any other gaming mouse, at the palm area is kinda small so your hand can breathe and not sweat, braided cord &#60;&#60; huge fan of these<br /><br />cons:<br />made of plastic, the thumb buttons are a little forward and the most forward button is hard to reach unless you choke up on the mouse, no wheel tilt (only scroll and push)
0060171928|5.0|I really loved the book. Any one that knows about Shaminism would enjoy this book.<br />The Human race is realy interdimensional. This woman experience is not  abnormal.<br />We all have the change to go to the next level and expeand our consciousness.<br />I advise people to run to their metaphysical school and take Shamanic counseling and Soul retreival classes.<br />Then your live will unfold in miraculous ways. Namaste
B004K4IZ54|5.0|The best movie ever. This is my favorite movie. Over 80% of the movie was CG and I love it.
B008YW5RH2|5.0|Tons of options when playing. Easy to pickup and entertaining for a long time. Interesting enough to play one match at a time or for an entire flight. The daily challenge is my favorite part.
B005R32L66|3.0|Program works well, is fairly easy to use, and is available across multiple platforms - all excellent qualities, and the only reason I still give it 3 stars. However, Skype has gone through some effort to (intentionally) prevent you from closing the application so it can continue to run/use resources.  It's embarrassingly bad - I mean seriously.<br /><br />Microsoft purchasing the product involved all Skype users having to get a Microsoft &#34;Live&#34; account (or whatever they call it) ,after which point Microsoft killed all the original Skype accounts leaving only the Microsoft accounts.  Was unpleasant at best, and doesn't make me think Microsoft will be an improvement going forward as owner of the product. They spent all that effort to frustrate the legacy/loyal Skype users, yet not an ounce on making the &#34;X&#34; or &#34;Close&#34; work in the customary fashion. I actually had/have a Microsoft account, so if it was that irritating to me, I can only imagine how upset the Skype users who didn't previously have a Microsoft account were.
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|This was a very good movie, explained allot of origins for the Wizard of OZ. Will recommend this to my friends
B0085YOD1A|3.0|Simple yet useful information, clean interface, but the battery life information was erratic on the Photon Q on which I installed it, jumping from 2 hours to, say, 90 hours.  Different devices will likely have different results, so you might see how it does on yours. I didn't spend enough time on it to see if it integrates nicely with a widget or provide dynamic info in the &#34;task&#34; bar area, but it didn't seem to.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I waited six years for a new book by Hosseini and was very disappointed.  It was disjointed and hard to follow.  I abandoned it and I am unsure if I will even finish it.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|The basic concept of this story was truly original and the follow through was well written. It was an easy and fast moving read that, naturally, left me wanting a sequel.
B00BPWDMP2|2.0|Compared to their last two albums, this is a dud.  I don't think I found any song that I liked on it.  I don't recommend this one.
1589949811|5.0|Very challenging, especially solo; the art is fantastic, the gameplay simple but engaging. I really enjoy it. I recommend you bring a friend. :)
B005ZMUWWY|4.0|I like how much of this story is told without words. In fact,  my favorite parts are the ones without dialogue.the movie gets a bit heavy handed in the parts with humans and dialogue, but overall a fun movie
0345479092|5.0|I love the daily cycle she uses! I didn't always track it, but its been a beneficial cycle with both of my children. A great flexible schedule. I appreciated her understanding that kids are different and what is helpful with one isn't always best for another. Definitely a top pick for a new parent.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game rocks!!! But I do like the PC version more then I like pocket edition. And the update is annoying because then you can't play with friends! Either way, this game is totally awesome!!!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I am completely captivated by this game. Even though I got through it quickly, the puzzles are challenging and intriguing. I love the background music and effects, as well. They definitely set the tone for the game. I give this game five stars in the hope that they make more rooms! I love the originality and have become quite addicted!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|In spite of the tragedies, I loved the intertwining of the characters through the various phases of their lives.  I looked forward to each time I could pick up this book and immerse myself in the story.
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|At first after reading the bad reviews, I was reluctant to watch this movie. It turned out to be a very good film. It is beautiful and has very good twist in the plot. If you like fantasy type movies, this a a must to watch. It isn't the very best film from Disney, but it is worth watching.
B00C1BV9Z6|5.0|This is great entertainment for the entire family. I watched it for the first time a long time ago (when it was released)<br />and now again with my young son. Still a thrill!
B00881VLCE|1.0|After it finished downloading, the install button would come up again. Several tries, I deleted it. Not doing it again!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Of the Michael Connelly books I have read I really like the character &#34;Harry Bosch&#34;  A real mans man.  Not too macho but tough enough and smart enough to handle the situation.  He is very good with his daughter in this novel.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|Can't wait for THOR. 2 great story line with an amazing ending. I would highly recommend this movie for its storyline and character developments.
B0031RS894|4.0|If you are a fan of the TV series, it's an interesting read. Not much more to say, but Amazon requires you to write a certain amount of words, so I am just writing words down to meet the requirements. So sorry, but you will find the book fun to read. Hope this is enough words?
B00BKU9ZFU|5.0|I too heard a snippet on NPR & went back to hear the podcast &<br />then realized 1 hr before her concert in SF that I wouldn't be able to get there (& found out then it was sold out) - She can't come back soon enough to the Bay Area in CA!<br /><br />I am a classically trained singer & most jazz singers do not impress me technically - but Cecile makes you remember those glorious singers and recordings which made you stop & listen & savor! I couldn't name you someone else who could do this recently! Even back when Ella was recording - much of her material was b-quality tunes until she started working with Norman Granz - but Cecile already has the goods & is teaming with very high quality musicians so we can all enjoy!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|It is just one of the best game ever I saw the movie it is like it is real life.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I ended up buying 3 of these sets because the prices were amazing.  Not only am I a huge fan myself but a couple boys in my life loved these presents.  Thank you for the holiday special!
B000A88EV4|5.0|Gritty & Raw.......Film Noir at it Best , Performances & Script are Unforgettable! You will want to Research more of The Brilliant Mike Leigh's work as well as the Actors.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Awesome book! My favorite in the series so far. Anyone who loves twilight or hunger faces has to read this series
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Was looking for a creepy mystery game and hit the Jack pot on this one. Can't wait to play part 2.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|It did have a surprise ending but it took me a long time to read it.  It kinda dragged along.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|one of the best games on the kindle and a very fun game that never ends really fun I rate it 100/5
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We are history buffs and found the acting outstanding and no where else where we cold match te hour of entertainment
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this game. It doesn't take that long to collect money if you actually play it more .So far i have 800,000 coins without buying any. So do not listen to the other reviews, it's fun!
B004MC0FO8|4.0|Great application just to bad you can only use five times a month for free. I downloaded because I heard a song I couldn't remember who sang it and it gave me the information I was looking for. If I thought I would use more often I would purchase full app, it is worth it.
B00B7ERH04|4.0|Works great. Don't have any complaints so far. So you should get this app if your looking for a free memory saver.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Love how JT combines almost big band, jazzy sounds with hip hop.  Great melody, great dancing music - in almost old-fashion way
B00C1GBOU6|5.0|If you loved the album Takk, you will be very happy with Kveikur.  Much of the complex innocence returns.  The song Stormur evokes the pure joy expressed in the song Hoppipola from Takk.<br /><br />I was a bit worried that Sigur Ros would lose some of the melodic power when I learned that Kjaerten had left the band.  But one listening of Kveikur reminds one that Sigur Ros should never be underestimated to produce the most innovative modern music of our time.  Another compelling classic.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I have enjoyed this game.  As far as all the technical stuff, I don't know about all that.  It is fun.  I would recommend this game.
B004GYY714|5.0|I have been frustrated that I can't get some of my favorite talk shows on my local station.  Now I can get them plus some I've never heard before.  I go to sleep at night with one of my favorite shows, I use the sleep cut-off button, and can set the alarm for my morning wake up broadcast.<br /><br />Love it, love it, love it.
B0095MVOMC|4.0|Pretty pictures, hidden numbers that are slightly challenging to find.  I like this game as much as the many other hidden object games I've played.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|In a noisy world, its good to see some Introverted Insight being wisely disseminated and hopefully integrated into many individuals train of thought.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|its challenging but not to a point of quitting. its fun on rainy days and I recommend to all ages. im a young tern and I believe everyone should test their knowledge and try this app! did I mention its free?!
B005LAIIKI|5.0|In 1858, the year in which the film is set, there were around 4.5 million slaves in the United States a tiny fraction of whom were treated relatively decently by their owners and as many of us, I imagine, receive the majority of our history lessons through the medium of film, the closest representatives of this enlightened bunch would be the owners of Tara and Twelve Oaks from Margaret Mitchell's (or David O. Selznick's) Gone With the Wind. Following the opening title sequence of the film of that book is a little ditty that would seek to persuade viewers of the heroic nature of the old south:<br /><br />`There was a land of Cavaliers and Cotton fields called the Old South.......<br />Here in this pretty world Gallantry took its last bow.<br />Here was the last to be seen of Knights and their Ladies Fair, of Master and of Slave.<br /><br />Look for it only in books for it is a dream remembered.<br /><br />A Civilization gone with the wind.'<br /><br />I suppose it all depends upon your personal definitions of `civilization' and `gallantry', a point many of those 4.5 million might have contested had they been given even the slightest opportunity.<br /><br />Tarantino's film, is positioned at the other end of the spectrum in terms of `slave' movies and, as such, stands in stark contrast to the cotton candy fluff depicted in GWTW. It will be no surprize to his fans that there are scenes of graphic violence: but, set against this, Tarantino's particular brand of humour is evident throughout, particularly personified in the performance of the excellent Christoph Waltz and the somewhat idiosyncratic soundtrack. There is also the rather `in your face' homage to the spaghetti western complete with Morricone score and an amusing send up of W. D. Griffith's `The Birth of a Nation' in which some ku klux clowns argue about the quality of their ridiculous head gear!<br /><br />But, aside from being superbly entertaining and some marvellous performances, notably by Samuel L Jackson and the brilliant DiCaprio, the film is a powerful indictment of the kind `civilization' that took for granted the subjugation of a whole people simply on the basis of their colour.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|It is a good and awesome game I really think you will like it and have fun game . I hope you will have as much fun as I am
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|This show just gets better and better.  How is Dexter going to get out of this mess next season?  The writers are evil geniuses!
B0049J0DC8|5.0|Never gets old! Glad I could introduce this movie to my toddler and she loved it too! New family tradition.
B00B4804KS|4.0|Jurassic Park is a timeless classic, no question. The 3D quality is good, but not AS good as Titanic's 3D Conversion. The film has a slight orange tint throughout, which is supposed to bring back a more cinematic quality, i'm not sure where I stand on it..but either way, it's a solid presentation with ground shaking audio and a delight of a film to watch.
B00881VLCE|1.0|Only got to play one time. It will no longer upload. Loved it when I was able to play it.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|While we are only 3 episodes in so far, it's been another great season and we continue to be impressed with the quality of the filming and the acting. The story and the time period are fascinating as well.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|I love movies based on historical events and was a History minor in college and I was BORED out of my mind. I didn't make it 2/3rds of he way through the movie. So sad. I was excited. I think I was biased in my judgement of the movie because I read reviews that suggested that the movie was not based in fact. Judge for yourself.
B00005JM02|5.0|I love the movie, but my 2yrs old nephew loves it more. I had been looking for the DVD in stores and NO one here in Grand Rapids had it new. So I thought about Amazon.com and figured they would have it used at a reasonable price. The stores had dvd as a part of a blu ray bundle but it was like $30. I expected to pay no more than $10 for a new DVD ONLY. So, to get the movie I wanted times 2 was even more wonderful. 5 Stars for accuracy in the description, great condition of the discs and prompt delivery time. Love it! Thanks.<br /><br />Jai and Nuk
B0063IH60K|3.0|Advertising after every deal = not worth the effort.  Otherwise this works well for basic solitaire.  Probably should have expected tons of ads since game was free.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This continues the saga of the Stark and Lannister families (as well as many others) and expands the personal insights into the principal characters. It is so challenging that it is hard to lay aside...you want to see what is going to happen next !
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|Teenage daughter requested this CD as a gift; she loves the band and this cd.  No problems with service or delivery.
B00C04H2VO|3.0|A little smaller than I pictured. I bought them for kids to play with.<br />They are cute and come with Gray Disc to stand them which they<br />kids probably won't use.
B002W7J3SO|4.0|Typical Hichock, great story, outstanding acting and of course the main scene. I love Hichock! The way the story builds is outstanding.
B0002XV30Q|5.0|I bought it for the Concerto No. 2, but I love the whole thing - both cds.  It makes for really lovely listening while reading.  The melodies just stay with you.
B00ABXA1HI|2.0|Splashtop only lets you control other computers on the same network, if you want to control one computer from a different location then you have to pay $0.99 and to me, thats dumb.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|In order to complete this game you have to either spread a fortune or waste your life trying to get the gems and money you are required to get in the game. About  2694 hearts and gems are required and in order to get the hearts you have to know a lot of people who play this or you can't win. Can't buy them either. You can get 50 gems by finishing the levels or 3 a week free. It was fun but after you get applejack it's crap.
B0089LOKHG|4.0|I have read the entire series and loved it. And I'm going to warn you, if you haven't read the entire series, you can't pick up with this one. So Alex is back. And so is Julian. And throughout the book Lena barely talks to either, especially Alex. But at the end Lena and Alex confess their love for each other.<br />ch other. But the author says nothing about what will happen between Lena Alex and Julian. I would suggest this book to you if you are a fan of books with no definite ending. I gave this book four stars because this series was amazing, but this book really left the readers hanging
B0091REZMW|5.0|so fun.  I have so much fun playing gthis game.  it gets you to think. its free and logical.  money is not required.
B004XVMCMQ|4.0|I liked this movie.  I think it hit all the important points from the book.  Fanny Price is one of my favorite Austin characters.
B000IZ8SD8|4.0|I watched this again after I went to the new star treck movie in theaters.  It helped me to remember what had happened in the past.
0800141660|5.0|Being an Austin fan there is no way to not watch all the movies made about her books.  I loved this story.  I was very impressed with the way the director brought the interplay between the two sisters into the movie.  Very good!
1451648537|5.0|Incredible journey thru the ingenious mind of Steve Jobs. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND READING THIS!!!!!!! I had asked my brother what i should read next and he suggested Steve Job's in the hard cover. Cover to Cover, i was hooked!
B00364K6YW|5.0|While not all the events in this movie are the same as in the book it was the closest a movie has come to being right on.  I'm a very big Collin Firth fan and he played Darcy very well.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|Watch it now! I have never known Gabriel Byrne to portray such a detestable character.Watchable series, very biased though. My ancestors were these folk...
B004SIP7AS|5.0|How could anybody not love Emma?  She is the most loveable busybody I've ever &#34;met.&#34;  Gwyneth Paltrow made her come to life on this movie.  Well worth seeing.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|An absorbing accounting of life on a North Korean  prison camp<br />I could not put this book down<br />I am certain that most Americans. Have no idea of what goes on in these \\"death camps\\"
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This is my second favorite Austin story.  Next to Pride and Prejudice.  This was done very well.  I have all the Austin Movies and two versions of my favorite.  Anyone who is and Austin fan should see all of them.
B007B6VOG0|1.0|I don't get it and wish I did.  His voice is so bad I have to turn off the radio.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I loved this movie.  If I could trade places with Jane for a short time I would do it in a minute!  What a great Idea this movie is.  A must see for any Austin fan.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I LOVE Spider.  It is sooo addictive.  I've found the sun coming up while playing it and didn't realize the time.  Highly recommend it to waste time or just have a good time.  Jo Mi
B000Z27HLS|3.0|This is my least favorite of Jane Austins books.  However I hope that isn't what influenced my opinion of the movie.  I didn't like the way it kept switching back and forth from the everyday scenes to the scary scenes.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|LOVE this CD.  The Piano Guys are great.  Got this on time and have listened to it at least 10 times already.  My kids love it too.  Highly recommend this CD.
B005T87QCI|1.0|I got this game because I like real steel but to get more players. and to get more stages and to make your one players. this game is no good do not get
B001PJRAUS|3.0|This is a bit of a different twist to the story of Pride and Prejudice.  I still prefer the original story.
B004WR125O|1.0|I tried this USB adapter in my Onkyo NX616, with miserable results.<br /><br />Of the 20+ wireless networks that show up on my laptop, only one was strong enough for this dongle to detect.  Unfortunately, since my network doesn't broadcast its SSID, it wasn't mine.  After realizing I couldn't manually enter an SSID, I exposed my network figuring that I could always re-hide it after I got the device to sync properly.  Sadly, even with an exposed network the adapter couldn't connect (to an Airport Extreme just 5 feet away).  Yes, I have a lot of devices using wireless in that area of my house, but that's because that is my entertainment center- which is where a receiver belongs.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this adapter because it doesn't seem to function under real-world conditions.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|What a great movie. Denzel shines in this movie. Period. It was a great performance and really brings to light the issues with substance abuse and how it doesn't just affect an individual but affects all those around them.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|SOA are absolutely the bom.....the character development is superb, and as this season clearly showed, don't get too emotionally tied to any character...'cause if your name ain't Jax, you ain't safe.<br /><br />The menus are easy to navigate, the video and sound are solid, and this is absolutely a must have for any SOA fan.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had already seen the movie but it was a while ago.  As per usual, the book develops characters so much better.  I felt like I really knew them an was experiencing what they were experiencing.  I can't wait for book 2!  I literally finished this one in a day!
B005BCE7FQ|5.0|I purchased this movie for the kids since they liked it so much at a friends house.  The 3D version of this is incredibly well done.  It's great to see four and five year old kids trying to catch birds flying around the living room - definitely a sign of a solid 3D experience.<br /><br />The sound is very good, and the extras are awesome.  But, at the end of the day, if you're buying this, it's to entertain kids with a 3D experience, and this set DEFINITELY delivers.
0785153942|4.0|Pacific Rim: Tales From Year Zero is a great precursor to what we'll see in the movie, and certainly helps to give you a better understanding about the Jaeger program, and the nueral link requirements. The artwork is also fantastic, and the early Jaeger designs, as well as Kaiju, are great. My only gripes would be the Kaiju scenes are rather quick to finish, and the book itself is as well. That said, It's well worth the cost for any serious Kaiju fan looking forward to the Pacific Rim film coming to theaters.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|While I'm not a huge fan of the story (Pocahontas, anyone?), this version is truly the benchmark for immersion into a movie.  The 3D experience is superb without making you duck.  You just watch the movie unfold around you instead of on a screen in front of you.<br /><br />The sound is equally solid.  For non-animation, this really is the standard that you'll hold your 3D experience to....
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|Our 6 year old loves this movie, but I've chuckled myself watching it with her. Imaginative, visually engaging, but if your little one is easily scared of villains you might hold off.
B0055EAJ7A|4.0|Thor is, of course, one of the Avengers, as well as moving along in his own series. And, the wife is more than a bit in love with Hemingway.  So when the 3D version of Thor came out, HAD to get it as a surprise for her.<br /><br />While the 3D doesn't pop like it does in &#34;reference 3D&#34; movies (Avatar, Rio), it IS quite good.  The sound is very solid.  Definitely a good edition to your Marvel collection.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|If you haven't watched it, why haven't you??!!? :D  I was reluctant to watch some more &#34;Medieval&#34; period shows, it's so hit or miss.  This is a mega-hit!  Of course you would know that by now unless you reside under a large rock :D.
B008D28HYS|5.0|nothing like a good challenge to get your brain going.  took me a while to get into these puzzles,  now I can't put it down.
B000U6BT40|5.0|I don't like Si-fi but the relationships and the plots are interesting and fun to watch.  This show would have had much higher numbers watching if it hadn't been on the Si-fi station. I just found it by happenstance because I steer clear of Si-fi these days ,too dark for my taste.  The season before the last one was fantastic. I wish a major network would pick this up and continue were they left off.
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|My boys liked this movie....I, however, felt it to be pretty lame.  It seems to have a target audience, other than kids, of the parental generation of the old arcade and Atari games.  Which, the idea seems cute, but as a 38 year old who didn't play many video games as a kid, I guess I didn't &#34;get&#34; some of this movie.  Not only that, but I felt like the movie ended up much more &#34;girly&#34; than the cover of the movie makes it seem...you think you're going to get this big guy who wrecks everything....and I guess he does...but most of the movie is, instead, dealing with a little elf-like girl in a girly video game--the girl having a very obnoxious voice, besides.<br /><br />Anyway...the kids liked it...so that's good...but this definitely doesn't hold even a half a candle to films like &#34;Tangled&#34;, &#34;Monsters, Inc&#34;, or &#34;Despicable Me&#34; or most of the other ones that come out.  I was very unimpressed with &#34;Wreck-It Ralph&#34;.
B005LAII1C|4.0|what can you say its the best out there it did what i thought it was going to do I liked it
B00BY8DIT2|3.0|their first cd was great and Beth has a great voice but I just can't get into this one. I'll give it another listen but, kind of disappointed
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|what can you say its the best out there it did what i thought it was going to do I liked it
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|GREAT CD. You will NOT be disappointed! BUY IT!! that's all I can say. I love the track Vincent Price, plus tracks 6,7,& 8 but they're all really good! I hope they tour the album here in the US!!
0786958731|4.0|what can you say its the best out there it did what i thought it was going to do I liked it I play this one almost the most out of all my games
B004ADH1RI|5.0|This is a movie about perseverance and friendship, and it's easy to see how this story shows how kids' imaginations are powerful assets for our children.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|A bit short, but excellently done. Creepy and soothing at the same time. Beautifully executed and creatively imagined. More, please.
B00CM9JKQM|4.0|I have been a fan of Queensryche since the mid-80's. I am not a blind follower of the band (I didn't buy Operation: Mindcrime II, Take Cover, or Dedicated To Chaos), but I rank them very high on my personal favorite bands list. While I have enjoyed a handful of Queensryche songs from Hear In The Now Frontier through Dedicated To Chaos, I haven't really enjoyed a complete album from the band since Promised Land...until now. The dual leads, inventive drumming, growling bass, and soaring choruses are back! The songs are also full of hooks. The only negatives are the running length of the album (which could have been solved by allowing the songs to develop a little more) and the mastering which is too hot. A short album is not so bad (this album is actually longer than Van Halen's 1984), but the mastering by Tom Baker is distracting, and that's a shame, because the performances on the album deserve better. All in all, I am happy with my purchase of the deluxe edition which also included 3 bonus live tracks, a patch, buttons, sticker, and a guitar pick (helping to make up for the shorter running length).
B0057RCFQS|5.0|What isn't there to love here? If you're a fan of Jurassic Park and don't yet have the movies, get them here and now buy purchasing this Ultimate Trilogy. It comes with 2 additional discs of special features. This is well worth it to get your Jurassic Park fix.
B00433SVP6|5.0|This series of books is amazing! Even better than the first series. So many great twists and turns! Best storyline ever.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Very addictive game. Fun, but takes awhile to really accomplish anything in it. Look out for the in game purchases, you'll be tempted.
B0033807E0|5.0|This is by far my favourite book in the first Percy Jackson series. Such an amazing series. Could not put this one down and had to read it in a day!
B009K86D86|5.0|This documentary makes me laugh at Perdue chicken commercials and their lies of treatment. Helped me to see the corruption across the board.
B00138J0KO|5.0|Probably his best solo effort but there isn't much out there for comparison. Title song is classic. I really enjoy it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love to take turns playing it with my daughter.  You should download it today.  You will love it too.
B003QSLW0K|4.0|A little slow in the beginning but turned out to be a really cute movie. It was also touching as you would expect with a Disney movie. My kids enjoyed the movie.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by the world created in this series. It starts out as many such tales do with a young boy and involves traveling towards a destiny or mission.What I really appreciate is the balance between character development and action. Not everything is a supernatural problem or solution, we get to see Kvoth develop as a person and face his world's version of interpersonal problems we all deal with and we can see his arc as a flawed hero. I look forward to continuing the journey with the characters. Comparable works would be Goodkind, Tolkien, Eddings, Terry Brooks, Robert Jordan, and even JK Rowling.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book is reminiscent of The Firm with a slightly slower gait. It has that ability to make the reader stay up just a little later to see what happens next. Grisham must of done extra research on this one. Definitely worth your time and money.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|this movie was hilarious. great for kids and adults. i would definitely recommend as a movie for a quick watch.
B002FQOI0A|4.0|This book seems so simple on the surface but as you keep on going, it get increasingly complicated and increasingly addicting. Definitely something you'll keep on thinking about for days after finishing.
B00881VLCE|2.0|Never played it, I don't remember if there were no instructions or  that the  instructions were not clear for me
B00CWY76CC|5.0|We're need more levels!!!! I love this game. It's very challenging finding the puzzles hidden in each level.<br />My daughter is addicted too!
B004SUWR2C|4.0|I am a game player.  Played UNO when I was younger & with my children.  Its fast moving & I like that.  Actually my 8  year<br />old granddaughter taught me the game,
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Requires skill and intelligence. Not rushed through and I love the effects! Buy this game if you are wondering if you should!
B0095P31L6|1.0|Could not finish watching,lost track of the storyline,would not recommend to anyone not even a good kid movie for babysitting
B00AB7HESI|4.0|Everything I saw in there was flawless. Good level problems, no jittery controls, a lot of words in there. My problem is that to get more maps costs money, and that's the reason I'm giving it 4 stars.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|Everybody was Kung Fu Fighting.... This movie came in perfect condition. I love this movie and if you have not seen it you must watch it.
B008KP6ENE|3.0|The controls are a little buggy for when you want to jump. It isn't very challenging and pretty much straightforward.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the detail,so descriptive yet interesting. The storyline was amazing, with so many twists and turns. And I especially loved the last sentence of the book.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|I am a huge Beach Boy fan, and they do not disappoint !!!<br />They are on their A GAME!!! for 70+ years of age!!!<br />Recommend Highly to any fan!!!
B00BN3DPQ4|4.0|Initially when I saw the preview it looked boring but after watching this movie I was very surprised at how good it was. The story was very good and will put together, a lot of action and well written I even liked the way they added humor in it. Give this a try and don't expect Arnold to be like terminator instead just allow him to take on a different role. Keep your mind open and you will enjoy this one.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app is awesome!!! It may take a little time to break out of the rooms but it is totally awesome!!! Download it right now!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Just the right amount of challenge per level, but got done with the game and definitely wanted more. Hope the promised new levels come soon.
B001I9WK14|5.0|The scene in Tempe, Arizona, when the film turns to color is worth getting this DVD.  The black & white footage is well-shot.  Of course the soundtrack is excellent.  Hopefully the supply doesn't dry up--very hard to find outside of Amazon.
B00ADS98FC|1.0|My title says it all, I am baffled at why so many people rate this movie high, it sucks.  People have no standards these days.
B00CJ32S74|5.0|I just started listening and it has already hooked me.  I have an electic taste for music and luckily the jazz, hip hop and indie rock practically speaks to all my tastes.  If you listened to the movie and thought damn this soundtrack rocks--then buy all the tracks by getting the full soundtrack--it won't disappoint.
B004SDEP38|3.0|This is a great product to read, however, it cuts the page numbers off the document, and<br />I get lost. VERY disconcerting and disappointing trying to read 700+ pages. Not happy with this.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book took a while to get into.  The style of the transcription of the testimony didn't give us a chance at first to get to know the characters.  However, about half way through the book I got hooked and enjoyed it.  I would prefer to have gotten to know Jacob a little better and explored the mom's character more--not just an overwrought parent.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|Very different from what I normally choose in a book but nonetheless I could not pull myself away from the story. Well worth the read
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I read the book first and I loved it! They changed a lot in the movie but it was still a great movie!!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I'm so surprised that they did so well on a mobile app version of this. I have been playing Magic for at least 20 years now and I love how they keep improving the game. This version is no exception!
B0093H8HXS|5.0|I was replacing my motherboard and bought a new one with the icore 3 it been working great no problems

B00499K9E0|5.0|This show kept kept getting recommended to me and I finally watched it...all of the episodes in one sitting. I was hooked. From classic Sherlock novels onto the screen. Great stories very true to the original novels just modernized.  The chemistry between Sherlock and Watson makes you truly believe they are best friends. I cannot wait for season 3.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I really liked this game.  The story awesome and it picture was great.  The puzzles wasn't to hard.  I can't wait for the second one!!!
B008133DO8|5.0|Watched the entire season in one sitting. I cannot wait for the next season. And yes, I now have a crush on Benedict Cumberbatch.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|A very interesting book. Write an original way and reveals the special world of life in North Korea. Fascinating book you can not put it until you finish it
B00A6CT012|4.0|Good ideas. Easy to read and follow! I keep referencing it again and again.  I do wish it had pictures though.... So I was disappointed about that.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|Neat spin on an old classic. Cool characters, fun to watch. Here are the 10 more words that are required.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|We love this music by Phillip! Every song is good. He is really enjoyable to listen to. Would recommend it to anyone.
B006C45LHA|3.0|I got this movie hoping for more. But got exactly what I was expecting. Cowboys, aliens, Harrison Ford and daniel Craig. Overall it was worth watching.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|This is a fun game. The gameplay is fast and fun. It is very addictive, especially once you start upgrading your troops and weapons.
B0067EKYS6|4.0|Having heard conflicting reports in reviews and through word-of-mouth,<br />I approached Baz Luhrmann's version of THE GREAT GATSBY with mixed<br />feelings. In the first half-hour I have to admit that I thought it was<br />rather over-blown and operatic; the screen was filled with color and<br />light; many scenes, although brilliantly staged and expertly filmed,<br />seemed rather irrelevant to the purpose of the story; while the music -<br />an anachronistic combination of Twenties standards and contemporary<br />rock - jarred on my ears. As the action unfolds, however, so the film<br />radically improves as Luhrmann becomes far more interested in his<br />characters. As Nick Carraway, Tobey Maguire assumes a pivotal role in<br />the action; he is the first person we see on screen as he recalls what<br />happened to his psychiatrist. At once appalled yet attracted to Jay<br />Gatsby's way of life, Nick comes to understand what lies behind it:<br />Gatsby's perpetual desire for recognition in New York high society.<br />Carey Mulligan comes across as rather colorless as Daisy Buchanan;<br />however, in terms of Lurhmann's interpretation, this seems entirely<br />coherent. Gatsby is prepared to go to any lengths to recreate his love-<br />affair with Daisy; Lurhmann shows that Daisy is not really worth it. As<br />Fitzgerald says in the source-text, she is \\"careless\\" as well as<br />indifferent. Joel Edgerton's Tom Buchanan is quite simply brilliant;<br />someone accustomed to a privileged way of life, who possesses little or<br />no understanding of anyone around him. He believes he can pick up and<br />throw away people at will, just like material things. Leonardo<br />DiCaprio's Gatsby bears a striking facial resemblance to the young<br />Orson Welles. At once confident yet suspicious, his eyes dart around<br />from person to person, as if unable to trust anyone. His final<br />confrontation with Tom in the hotel room is quite stunning - especially<br />when Gatsby loses his civilized veneer and reveals his true nature. At<br />the film's end we are left feeling terribly sad: Gatsby might have been<br />a fraud, but as Nick says, he embodies the kind of perpetual hope that<br />seems quite at odds with the material world around him.sby loses his civilized veneer and reveals his true nature.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed it and can't wait for an update. I. liked how challenging it was and that you had to think on the solutions.
B009ICQ6KO|2.0|So disappointed! Sounds as if the music is coming from the bottom of a barrel. I know their music is better than this.
B00CE004XM|5.0|Beth Hart and Joe Bonamassa are fabulous!! If you have not heard them, you should listen to teh, you won't be sorry
0920668372|5.0|This is an excellent read with your young ones!  I love, love, love it!  or should I say, 'I'll love it for always'?
