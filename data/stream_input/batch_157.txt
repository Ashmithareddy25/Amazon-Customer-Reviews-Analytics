B000NW6W0W|2|Update: This remanufactured part has started leaking after 5 years and only turns on when I rev the engine really high. Will be replacing with a lifetime warranty 4Seasons replacement kit..<br /><br />Original: Nothing like OEM Prizm AC parts. The compressor is a known weak spot that will need replacement about 10 years.<br /><br />They weren't painted to prevent corrosion to the &#34;belly seals&#34;<br /><br />These ones are painted to prevent it from reoccurring. Compared to your other options:<br /><br />The cheaper OEM Delphi part [[ASIN:B001NZ6F8M Delphi CS0077 Air Conditioning Compressor]] which doesn't have paint from the picture...<br /><br />The more expensive DENSO part is actually a rebranded Delphi: [[ASIN:B000PWWTWU Denso 471-9002 New Compressor with Clutch]]
B00MU7AJ66|5|Very happy with these. They come with adhesive to hold them in, but they also have tabs that do a pretty good job. In fact, I'm not sure the adhesive would work by itself. Only time will tell how well these hold up and stay in through the hot summers and cold winters.<br />Head's up. Once inserted, these make the grille far more rigid and harder to remove. If you need to take the grille off (change lights, etc.), it takes a bit of work to wiggle the grille free or remove these so the grill comes off easily.<br />All told, it took 10 - 15 minutes to install the set.<br />Some reviews have noted that they are glossy. I'd call them somewhere between glossy and flat. Is that called flossy?
B00HJ6O4A0|5|Very good quality and comfortable to carry. Those pockets next to handle are so useful.
B00HNW8MJ4|5|looks great
B006VFEJJQ|5|I bought at local auto parts store as I needed right away and paid $190 I think.  Didn't want to ship back either just in case it was defective. Worked out well, watched video on You Tube and wasn't bad to install and took my time. Dealer was going to charge $350 to install toyota battery which I didn't like.  In New England only good for 3-4 years IMO.<br />Car does some weird things when battery starts getting weak. Car is all electronics and Toyota should use this type of battery.  Had in a couple of weeks in freezing weather and makes big difference. I don't worry at all about letting car run with accessories on while parked, plenty of back up power.  Can't comment on how long will last but I've read good reports on longevity.<br />Been using for 5 months now and works flawlessly.  Original battery can last much longer in warmer climates but this battery is a must in colder climates.  It is pricey but comes with a 3 year free replacement and you can put in yourself if you're a bit handy.
B003EOZKPE|4|Fits perfect good black finish good and solid. Installed on my 2014 Tacoma TRD off-road. Also purchased 4 KC round off-road lights fit perfect. If your looking for just a light bar this is a good deal for the price.
B009T98U2S|4|Good for warmer days.  I'd get it a size larger so you can fit some cloths under them. Two thumbs
B000IEZENQ|4|these vent shades fit right to the tee on my 2012 ford fusion had to no trimming what so ever and very easy to install
B002UX5CHG|1|I replaced my stock bulbs with nighthawk bulbs. They are no brighter than my original bulbs. They \\"BURNED OUT\\" in less than six months. I Had to put my old bulbs back in.
B0000AZ7WJ|4|Fits our hitch very well. Lock is protected by end cap. Slips on and off very easy. Well made. A good set of bolt cutters would render it in one snap but getting the cutters in there would be tight. Good thing! Don't want to make it easy to cut lock. Would recommend it.
B007GCLG08|5|I used this decal on my Ninja. It turned out to be a quality decal. I have washed the bike many times and it does not seem to be peeling off any time soon. It looks good too because my bike is white and the decal red. It gave some much needed color to it. Good price & quality decal. I hate when I order decals and they turn out to be stickers. Not with this brand. It was also easy to apply.
B0075XBN60|5|This decal is a must and very unique way to show off my Disney side! Displays the Disney logos into one decal.
B00360C4MS|5|Received the license plate holder in a timely manner and in perfect condition. Makes a great addition to my car.
B002ZTNVI2|5|Perfect fit, as advertised.  Have the mats in the front, now have the back protected.  Covers entire rear compartment carpet.  No problem cutting out for the Sony amp.  Quick service by Amazon
B00AO78V8M|1|Had it on my car for about a weeks or so, during which it rained often. Its color became faded and its adhesive lost its power.<br /><br />Do not buy.
B00LF5WWDM|5|Had my doubts about this product but if you have what people like to call \\"road rash\\" on your car, you know where the front has been peppered by tiny rocks and sand leaving marks everywhere then this is a good alternative to paying a body shop $$$ to get those fixed.<br /><br />To test it out I started with my side view mirrors which had so many pock marks in them that it just made sense to pour the paint all over and use the squeegee to smooth it out.  I let it sit for about 5 minutes and then used the provided seal act solution and the marks are now nearly all gone, I was very impressed.  Do they look brand new?  No.  Do they look 1000% better than before, absolutely!<br /><br />I applied it the same way to the front of my hood and around the grill area, poured the paint on, squeegeed it around and then used the solution to clean it up. Results are just as good, very hard to tell all those pock marks are even there, the smaller ones filled in and the larger ones are now the same color as the car so really hard to notice.<br /><br />And yes the color they sent me matches the color of my car perfectly.  I also like that because this is real paint it binds to the car meaning it wont just disappears after a few car washes.  It should last a long time.<br /><br />For the price my only gripe is that I wish they gave you more paint and cleaning solution.  If you have a lot of little pock marks like me than you will end up using the entire bottle.  Otherwise this was a good investment for me.<br /><br />Lots of videos on youtube and their site if you get nervous about how to apply it.  And don't worry if you get it somewhere you didn't mean to because the cleaning solution will take it right off as long as you get it in the first 2 hours - after that it is permanent.<br /><br />Good luck!
B00Q2E2QF0|4|It's always nice to have a backup plan if your battery is fading. This one is fairly compact, and has easy to read LEDs to show state of charge. (Be sure to check it periodically and top it off as needed. Nothing worse than having let your backup plan run down!) The flashlight is surprising bright, which I discovered by accidentally turning it on while looking at it. A good item to have in my trunk.
B000A0CAJE|5|Would buy again
B002UCAGVE|5|Worked perfectly.  Exact fit.
B008HY12EO|1|these graphics were terrible quality and the lines are absolutely ridiculousand I also got the hood graphics from this companythe graphics were too wide for the hood of my truck and his customer service when I got a hold of them he was totally unprofessional.this guy has no business selling these graphics pay close attention and listen to me they are no good.
B0031I204W|4|I purchased this cover to cover my recumbent bicycle - HP Velo Street Machine. Small size fit is pretty snug.  After a year outside in L.A., the cover developed couple holes around the points of tension. I think I will try Large size next to see if I can avoid damaged fabric next time. For the price, it is light weather protection for your vehicle.
B000UUMM6K|4|This product had easy to read instructions and was very easy to install.  I believe I had it completely installed in about 45 minutes, but I was taking my time and making sure the holes were lining up before I drilled.
B000A3I9XW|5|Great buy, gets the job done and the best part about it is that it is magnetized. Do not hesitate to buy this product.
B00KLZ65GM|5|Gave as gift. Person loved it. Just as advertised
B00HS6HXQS|5|Work great for 05 vibe
B000I8VKZ8|5|I have bought and use perhaps 4 of these in the last 2 years, and they really help with cold weather battery power for starting my cars in the cold North Dakota winters.  I have other Kat's products that I give the highest praise to also.  I like this brand.
B003IOITRG|5|I PURCHASE FOR FATHER DAY  THREE YEARS AGO, AND STILL WORKING LIKE NEW MY HUSBAND LOVE IT....GOOD PRICE..GREAT VALUE...I REALLY RECOMMEND FOR FATHERS DAY....
B0002SPC44|5|This brush works great on the hard areas to reach on the wheels. Bristles are just right, not to soft nor hard. The price is great compared to other wheel brushes. I can't say how well the other brushes work, but this one works great!
B00IQXKB84|5|Great mc vest
B002MQCY7C|4|I'VE ONLY USED IT A COUPLE OF TIMES, AND IT CAN BE A BIT TRICKY SOMETIMES. I THINK ONCE I GET THE HANG OF IT, THOUGH, IT WILL BE REALLY NICE.
B000HEBR3I|1|I used this pump to remove the collected water from my dehumidifier.  Worked great for about a week, then just simply stopped.  I tried new batteries, etc...nothing.  A total waste of money....don't waste yours.
B000YC8NFS|5|These are the best, low profile so there not as noisy as another pair I have on another vehicle and installation, in my case was literally a snap. They seem well made and were still flexible in 20 below which was the temperature out when I installed them.<br /><br />They shipped quick and were well packaged and would probably only get broken unless someone was really not paying attention.<br /><br />Great Stuff!
B000EH2SP4|3|Yes it's a funnel and and works like funnel should.  Don't believe the color though, the picture shows red, the description says white, the product I received was black.
B00EFFYC6Y|5|Nice shape
B000OH8RFO|5|Something my husband has wanted for a long time (now on his 2nd convertible mustang) and this model has proved to be completely effective and attractive and can stay in place with roof up; easy install - I assume it's as easy to remove, but my husband hasn't taken it off yet! He just loves it!
B0057WSJO0|5|I got a quote from a locksmith for $300 to get me a spare key. I immediately hung up the phone and purchased this key. I took it to a hardware store where they matched it to my existing key for around $5. I followed the simple directions included and within 10-15 minutes had a spare key for a hell of a lot less than $300.
B004YKRO6K|3|used them in my 2012 veloster. great iceburg blueish color to them. about a quarter brighter than stock just better looking color that's about it. i would just buy an hid kit if you really want blue lights my hid kit took 20 minutes to install and 3 tools.
B001UC55UW|1|two days after installation the battery on this device died, now they need to be replaced and the money spent getting them installed is gone in the wind...
B002NY5FHE|3|deceptive picture - there is only one.
B000KF9M68|2|OK quality carpet, but the advertisement says grommet holes are provided for applications with carpet anchors. My 2000 Honda Insight has anchor posts on the driver side. The mats do not have matching grommeted holes. Sure enough, the mats ride forward and eventually interfere with the foot pedals. That is dangerous and inconvenient. I punched jagged holes for the anchor, and now they look good and stay put. This would be a 4 rating except for the missing grommets
B009NUVLVU|3|Warm, comfortable but the leather is thin (tore on one finger very soon after purchase, glued it up, holding well). I like them, Served well this winter and made a big difference to riding in the cold. Decent value over all.
B0012TZ1RU|5|Would definitely reccomend this product to a friend! I had no problem putting the pussy on the chainwax with a can of this golden elixer!
B009DJOJ2O|5|Item arrived quickly and was a perfect replacement for the original. Has been on the car for a month with no issues
B00F0RGQJM|5|Perfect fit for our C-Max!
B00A48FBCK|4|great resistor's, I am using them for my Honda CR-Z 12' for the front turn signal/parking light and rear turn signals for LED's. Only downside I had to add  a longer wire (easy for an electrician as myself) not too easy for people who have no knowledge though.
B002M6P104|5|people love that look, get lots of compliments, was easy to install by my self. easy to maintain, water proof, love it!
B0012TRB9Q|5|Just enough difference it makes them look cool.
B0006IX87S|5|Wife want even travel with out one. Use it everywhere we go. Save the end caps and re-install and keep it clean. Easy to order and delivered in a few days
B000A8MR30|5|I did a lot of research before taking a chance on this hitch for my 2004 Jeep Wrangler. Let me just say this went on so quick and easy, I could not believe it. Fits perfectly and has a very tough gloss finish. You might prefer a flat finish, but This one will hold up much better. Only $105!
B003125D9M|1|Really??!! $1000??!! There has to be a typo!!! Please fix this. If this is correct then this piece better be made out of real GOLD!!!
B00HFHE6KG|1|not happy part does not fit do not know how to send back
B00KPWBBLA|1|I really don't understand how people can give this more than one start when countless people complain about these not fitting/lining up. I had the same issue as many others. One side barely lined up with the holes after literally having to kick it into place. For the other side, there was no shot of it bolting up. I had to drill into two spots on the rails to extend the holes and make it possible for them just to bolt up. Even with all 3 8mm bolts in place, the rest still didn't line up with the body.  The middle portion of the rail does not line up and as a result, I couldn't get the bolts to go through to catch it onto the body.<br />It took me hours to install these because of poor fittment and all the drilling. In comparison, it took me 20 minutes to install the Mopar Rock Rails.
B001S2DSQW|5|If purchased separately this pro kit would cost a lot more, can't beat the price on a great product. Has everything you need to make your vehicle shine. Heck of a value!
B00FTB4PCE|5|Watched a YouTube video for instructions. Installed in less than ten minutes.
B000CB54U8|5|what I needed
B000W9QR42|5|This is exactly what I was hoping I was buying. This is the third CRV in our family group, and I have equipped each with a cargo mat. Some of the newer cargo mats (or trays) have the nice lip (as this one does), but are fairly rigid and I think they would have a tendency to crack over time with the cold/hot of the mountains, labs jumping up onto them over and over, gear being tossed in, and other abuse. This mat is like the older style ones in that it is more thicker rubber but pliable. It also has the nice modern lip all around for spills, and I can tell it will live through the outdoor lifestyle we throw at it. I would definitely buy this product again.
B00J1LVCCO|3|love love love it! As with most Dodge trucks, my dash is cracked all up, this cover makes it look so much better and professional looking.  Although, now a couple years later is has faded to a pinkish color, hubby not happy about that, his truck, he isnt really into pink
B002WP362U|5|Very sticky. Use to finish off your acoustic dampening project.
B006TMREA2|5|Fit perfect, and arrived as stated.
B004YZEJ18|5|It's makes moving my utility trailer and boat around the driveway an easy job.<br /><br />Before getting this device it was a back breaking chore.
B00JRA2HEG|5|This is great light.  It's made from aluminum and not plastic.  I've had other lights that would come flying out of their brackets every time I hit a bump.  These lock securely in place and aren't going anywhere.  The two lights turn on individually and have two modes, flashing or steady.  The only complaint I have is that the clamp is a little big for my seat post.  I had rubber shims from other accessories that I used to mount it but it would have been nice if the light came with them.<br /><br />An unexpected bonus is that the light came with batteries installed plus 4 more sets of batteries (each light takes 2 batteries).
B00120MAGY|5|Fits well. Had to cut the top off with razor but that is easy to do with razor. That is where the packaging was attached.
B005MJYTYC|5|I am so happy I bought this shoulder brace. I've been in severe pain for weeks after aggravating an old shoulder injury with excessive exercise. The pain was radiating down my arm, and even my legs and feet started to feel the effects. I wore this brace for three hours yesterday, and although my shoulder still hurts, I can actually function and get things done that had been extremely painful...simple things like washing dishes...even holding a cup of coffee. I am a 5'5\\" woman, 145 pounds, and I bought the medium size and it fits perfectly. I did, however, need a little assistance in adjusting the brace properly, since it does take a bit of contortion to swing the one strap around behind my back.
B002OMQACY|4|a real bitch to mount, but they all are very hard to install., use a make shift template it really helps.
B000K7TOLE|5|This stuff is like magic.  My front door locks were really hard to get the key in and out of.  I was considering just replacing the locks, but after doing some research, I decided to try this product.  Wow... is all I can say.  The locks are like brand new.<br /><br />Before you replace sticking locks or call a locksmith, give this product a try.
B001IZKE0M|4|Just removed from camper.  Cover did great through high winds and snowy winter.  Great  investment highly  recommended for this region.
B000VB1JIA|5|best purchase ever I just love it ! it's fit on my car and cover all floor rely good job keep going guys thanks lot !!
B00BYH6C1E|1|Must be a U.S. thing to feed on fries, fumble with the cell phone and count your change while you should be paying attention on where you are going. Was witness to an accident in Texas, where 2 young girls driving directly ahead of me died - killed by an oncoming semi-trailer combo while having Lunch behind the wheel. Smarten up.
B00684TIVE|4|Met my needs for reasonable price.
B000CAO7AW|5|These fit my  granddaughter's request for \\"cute floormats\\" for her first car.  I also bought the steering wheel cover to match.  She loved them!
B008G1WI4G|5|THEY WORKED VERY NICE
B007EZOIMU|3|I bought this after reading the one star rating, but consider myself someone who wants to see things for themselves.<br />I will be honest with you, it probably won't fit your vehicle, the straps barely extend out and the part that actually 'grabs' on the door frame, would be pretty wobbly if it did.  It also comes with no installation or assembly instructions.  If you're not mechanically savvy, then don't purchase this.  Why the 3 starts then?  The build quality is good.  I can stand on one bar and it barely gives (200 lbs.).  Can't expect much more for the cheap $50 price.  Being mechanically savvy, I am going to modify the rack to work for what I need, so since it will work, I can't rate less than 3 stars knowing what I was getting.  Hope this helps.
B006LT03H4|5|These are the first &#34;performance&#34; rotors I've tried.  I also got the semi-metalic Street Pads to go with them.  I've had some good pad upgrades in the past, EBC GreenStuff, which really helped my old Volvo.  My OEM rotors and pads were not worn and in good shape.  These new pads and rotors really work much better with nice feel and good bite.  You do hear them when really stepping on them though, if that's a problem for you, I don;t mind it.  Like I said, I have nothing to really compare them to, as far as other rotors go.  That said, they are a huge improvement over the stock stuff.  I think I will also get the same product for the rears too.
B001RP0OCG|1|This item is not a cling sticker.  It is a peel and stick, it will not cling to the window.  You can not use this item on the inside of a glass.  It also cost more to ship it back than what it's worth.
B00319WBVI|5|Works perfectly
B000C2GFNM|5|good
B00026Z3PE|5|I love it.  I ordered 3, one for each of my ATV's.  I can now keep track of my bride and my grandkids.  Easy installation.
B00279JCNS|1|This ítem didn´t fit in my Hyundai Sonata 2008, 2,4 L. I had to buy another reference. Do you hace another refrence for this Hyundai sonata mODEL?
B00K4Q43ZS|5|The Alaska Bear Car Wash Mitt will get the job done regarding cleaning your car and/or truck thoroughly. It will go over your hand with ease which will allow you to tend to your cleaning tasks correctly and efficiently. The chenille & microfibers are the keys to its cleaning power that is actually long-lasting. The makers of it decided to use the colors blue and orange for it.  The mitt has a porcupine-like texture on one side that is soft with an opening for your hand. I would describe it as a plush, unique, and helpful towel. It's able to draw in quite a lot of water and can tidy up anything. I believe that it has the tools to get rid of mess of all kinds so get ready to smile for awhile.  The vehicle-cleaners will appreciate the stand-out product & encourage some of their family & friends to purchase it. The product should be supplied to the car-washers and detail-folks worldwide. HAH! I rate it 5 stars.
B00408HMWM|5|Great purchase
B00HAWLG54|4|Yes very happy with rear light and side mirror purchase.
B00B4F9EXY|5|for me boat live well pump easy to install
B002KR1TWE|5|Worked perfect!
B0035GX602|5|This product was good for the intended purpose and was a good price. It arrived right on the schedule that AmZon promised.
B00P67GT7K|5|Worked great buffing out my 32 year old paint on my Harley shovel. Little bit goes a long way.
B0052SF0LO|1|Is not waterproof!... after a first light rain, stop worked.
B0099S559A|5|extremely happy with product cannot beat that price! instructions were easy and quick package arrived 4days earlier than expected.
B003ZUEAYY|5|This is a good quality light.  I purchased another brand before and this brand is much better built.  Its worth it to spend a little extra for much better quality.
B000H81CDO|5|I started using PureONE filters years ago (they were blue, not yellow-gold back then) after reading studies on oil filters. I put over 300,000 miles on that car, it still ran like a top when I sold it, it never needed any type of motor work. Team this filter up with Mobil 1 if you want you car to last!
B0052LWGTU|3|My  chief complaint on this is that it is way overpriced. What you get is a piece of foam cut into a wedge and a cover that only covers the top of the wedge, what you see in the photo. The bottom side has no cover. This will raise you about an inch and a quarterand probably settled down some eventually. So if you need 2 inches or more this is not for you. I estimate the manufacturer made this for less than a dollar. So why not see if you can make something yourself?
B002WMCIKY|5|I am so upset that when I finally got the money saved to buy this vest it is unavailable!!!! I do hope it is back in stock soon! I've searched for the perfect vest for years. My current vest is torn and at least 20 years old. Please restock this idem. It's apparently popular if it's out of stock!? I just know it is the perfect vest I've been looking for....:(
B009DJVH2O|1|Worked almost a week before it quit working.  Have to pay own shipping to get it replaced. Don't buy one.
B00UVYS1B0|2|Product wasn't what I thought it was. Wasn't like my old CX7 key fab at all. Very upsetting.
B00S2IBEHU|5|Easily Installed, Worked Perfectly!!
B002ZTMEUS|5|It worked great
B003BZD03K|5|Keeps the hose from bending at the travel trailer connection point. Works great and no complaints.
B000BZWW4Q|5|it works..
B00IX5HPXO|5|Just as promised!  Brand new, great service and great price!  Excellent seller!
B0009IK4TA|5|Very good
B002AKFA94|4|These really look good in my garage. IMHO the base needs to be weighed down after you get it. My wife put an old 5 lb weight on hers so she can ram it! LOL!
B007THZMWI|4|Refresh rate could be faster than twice a second. Probes could have come with aligator clips. The PC serial mode turns on by default which draws more power than needed. Works fine other than these issues.
B000LG8GI6|5|LESS THAN 5 MINUTES TO PROGRAM IT
B003V5NUDK|5|Shipped faster than I expected, extremely satisfied with the quality.
B006WZOVHA|4|Works as intended.
B00BGZ499Q|5|I'm so happy with my purchase, the material is great and does the job. All my friends envy my car keys, I will definitely order again.
B000BQQMPK|5|Impressed with sturdiness and great gray color.  Fit ford ranger perfect and doesn't slide!!!!!
B008OYMYEO|5|I chose to purchase my fog lights thru a 3rd party on Amazon. They were only charging 25% for 2 lights versus the $200 per light that my dealership was charging.  My local body shop was also charging per half hour to install each light and at half the cost.  The economy makes it worth while to shop around and find the best prices on goods and services.
B0047L4L9Y|1|It fell apart and I lost the attachment with the logo. I could not find it so I'm going to get one thru the BMW dealer.
B007MDYYHS|5|Very nice center cap decals! The raised resin on the decal is about 3/16&#34; thick with rounded edges and they look like factory decals! If you don't like your factory decals and these will fit (measure very carefully, measure again, then convert measurement to Cm with an online measurement conversion website to ensure that the Volk center cap decals will fit exactly). If these Volk center cap decals will fit and you buy them, you will be VERY pleased with them!!!!!
B000TDQG6K|5|Works great on my 2004 jeep wrangler and bolts right up using the existing bolt holes. Make sure you use some lock tite on the bolts though.
B003A8D6YG|5|The best for keeping things from sliding off the dash of your car.  When they cease to &#34;stick&#34; just rinse them off and it's good to go again.
B0036R6IT6|3|The quality is great, the rear lid is great. The storage is great. It is sturdy, not flimsy or flexy. The rear latches are great. Very good molded plastic parts. The bad is- when they molded the back rest it is at 90 degrees to the seat, so it is very uncomfortable to sit in. The back rest should have been molded at 60 to 75 degrees so you can lean back a little.  I had to make a shim from a 2X4 to raise the front so the back rest would lean back. I raised the front 2\\". This really helped. The cushion are good, but the seat could be thicker. The arm rests are molded plastic, thus hard. Cup holders would be cool.  However, I would buy another.  Price was good.
B005NLCGF8|5|The Bluetooth OBDII scanner worked great with the torque pro app on my Droid Bionic and Acer tablet.  Came with easy to follow instructions and I had it hooked up and running with in the first 10 minute of opening the box.
B003SYNQFQ|5|Great quality and installation was really quick. It not only comes with the plastic lens but a wiring harness with bulbs as well which makes installation just one plug away.
B0035AXIGA|5|What's not to like.  This Emblem has been on 2 vehicles since being purchased.  Travels take us to lots of places in the US, and we get the Gator chomp in the unlikeliest places.  Everyone recognizes the UF Gator.  The only thing to remember is Go Gators!
B000BO8YVM|5|It is a large funnel that is pretty long. It fit's where I need it to. Just be sure when you're buying it that it won't be too tall for you to pour anything into.
B007QBR8TW|5|Exellent upgrade from stock size. Plus being new and not a reman.<br />May or may not need longer belt i didn't.
B00DR14U0K|5|Very Nice with perfect fit 1991 Miata.
B00KTIBFQG|5|Just what we needed!
B00KBN68E8|5|The best car freshener ever. buy it.
B0009VF1DQ|5|So easy to clean your dash in a second! I keep it behind the seat for easy access.
B009LQ4UC8|5|This air filter looks to me to be of the same high quality as the Honda original. I would buy another and recommend this to any one wanting to save at least $20 over the Honda product.
B0002YQSRS|1|broke first time i tried to use it
B004PRZ5JU|5|My new puppy, at 8wks, has been sleeping in her crate with this cover, open on one side, with no winning from night one.  She's eleven wks. old now.  Fits my Midwest crate perfectly.
B00JH25GLU|5|Started the bike right up with this battery.
B0024NSYYU|4|This has been a great replacement for my headlight assembly which had become so cloudy it was probably blocking half the light.  The rice on those product was fantastic compared to the nearly $400 I thought I'dhave to pay for Hyundai part.  The fit and finish aren't as good as the original parts but for the price its aworthwhile tradeoff.  I recommend this prpduct..
B00NAJ6HYQ|5|Awesome product.
B009XAQZY8|5|I just moved to a city from a tiny village and had no idea where I was - even with a map! This little gem instantly made it possible to drive all over my new metropolis and stay sane. Knowing without a doubt which direction I was headed by looking at my Bell probably saved the few dollars this cost in less gas the first day. It mounted easily with the rubber feet on my dash (I didn't use the sticky tape, just dampened the feet and pushed it down). It has been over 100 degrees here and the Bell is still firmly in place.
B00CDT9ZFC|5|Works well with my vehicle and less chance of me breaking the short antenna when washing.<br />Arrived in less time than I excepted.<br />Ford had no idea when back orders would be filled.
B003NOD4US|1|Opened package pushed the latch in to test it now is stuck. Latch will not return to open state.
B005VFWOOE|5|Great!
B0006VORDY|4|Just what we needed to keep the camper from smelling like whatever we cook. Windbreaker works great and BTU's are just what we need. Wife loves it because she can cook and still be out with the family instead of stuck inside cooking.
B001GN3ESU|4|I purchased this to cover a four pin flat trailer wiring connector mounted to a receiver cargo carrier that I wired for lights.  Since a lot of trailer lighting issues stem from rusted and corroded plug connections, I thought this dust cover might keep the connection clean and dry.  It was difficult to find the trailer connector cover locally, but as is often the case, Amazon had it.  The cover itself tightly fits the connector and the integrated cord wrap fit over my harness despite the extra thickness due to being covered in split loom and wrapped in electrical tape.  The rubber appears to be molded from scraps or recycled material that was pressed together as it does not have a homogenous appearance. Hopefully that will not affect long-term durability.  For now, it works great!
B0028036QU|5|They made my wheels more attractive.awesome fit
B00514BAR2|4|Nice product.  looks nice with the corresponding grips.  couldn't do without it now.
B00CD2RHTU|3|Not the best looking out there but definitely not the worst looking.  Given the price though it's hard to complain.
B002GIL64I|1|Be careful buyers... looks like they are selling you a \\"Jerry\\" can here. The Jerry can is threaded male and the plastic nozzle is female. The plastic nozzle is your only seal.<br /><br />The picture they are showing, though, is of a \\"Blitz\\" can(I know, I own one) where the can is threaded female, and the nozzle is male. The Blitz can will come with a plastic nozzle AND a separate screw in metal cap with O-ring, for transport or storage, that actually seals very well. I've transported the can using the metal cap inside my suburban. It has fallen over and no leaks and no smell, Pretty tight seal because the thick metal cap actually screws into the can and has a fat o-ring! I suggest you search for the 5 gallon Blitz can for better sealing. Make sure it has the O-Ring!
B0050VGZLM|2|To be fair, I don't know how well this works yet.  I gave it to my dad for Christmas but the packaging alone was embarrassing.  It looked so generic.  It was in cheap ugly plastic and it looked like I just picked it up at a liquor store or something.  I went ahead and gave it to my dad because if it works, then oh well.  My family teased me about it and it was embarrassing.
B004VGAJOG|5|I had to replace both inside door handles, so I bought two pairs in case they broke again. The price for two pairs together was not much more than one pair. Great price, quick delivery and quicker replacement. I replaced both handles in 15 minutes. They work great. I'm happy with the product and service. It's OEM handles.
B0006IX7UQ|5|This little tray is awesome. It perfect for fresh squeezed lemon or lime juice that you can freeze and add to drinks or recipes.
B00032K4FG|5|Always look for best price for a product. This was great quality and was by far best price. Good seller
B002BA98LO|5|A nice addition for any Chevrolet. I put these on 1 of our Camaros and it looks great. We take our cars to various car shows and they are worthy of the \\"extra touch\\" plus they actually work.
B008SGNT1K|4|Perfect fit, just as described. Look just like OEM.
B0083H5V92|5|This cooler fits perfect and weight is 1 pound just a pain to get the old one out and the new one in!!Great price too
B000FJU8L2|2|Gauge was DOA, need to order a second unit to get it working with the new sender. Called Actron to verify all gauge/sender connections with multimeter and still no gauge movement. Not happy.
B001C3B2D8|4|This is for my wife's helmet.  I had bought one for her already & she liked it so much that she decided that she wanted another one for her half helmet.
B000E3GGII|3|I bought wild cherry seat covers and steering wheel cover when I first bought my car. With time and use, the steering wheel cover was started to look shabby so I checked a few stores and they no longer carried the steering wheel cover in stores for some reason, so I found it online. The steering wheel cover is fine and it is a wild cherry cover, BUT in the picture it shows the one that was lined with the soft velvety material, which is how my older one was, AND that's what I wanted. However, when this one arrived it didn't have the velvety lining, instead it had a rougher surface which I wasn't too keen on. BUT, it's only a steering wheel cover and it matches my seat covers just fine. Overall, a good quality product.
B003C24F8Q|4|Sized mine a bit too large but its slick overall!!
B000YMP1SA|5|The best flat tire repair.
B00393NDZO|5|If these are the same color as the low beam that i bought, then i like them!
B00BBHS6D4|5|Perfect enhancement to a license plate.  First one sent partially obscured the name of my state at the bottom of the plate.  I mentioned this to the seller and he took it upon himself to send a narrower frame with the same P-3 message.  Great product and great seller.
B00COOS5NY|4|Great product much higher quality and they come with wiring harness and  power capacitors to maintain a constant power supply to ballast. Previous ballast I bought would flicker and not look professional these however are great however I did just have a ballast go out on my 9006 ballast. I just bought OPT7 9006 KIT AND dogs 880 kit. The fogs power capacitor blew on installation but I believe it was my fault but im not sure they work well without it but flicker a tad bit. Great product just wish I did not have to remove and send back to get new ballast. Shipping time was outstanding like 3-4 days I got product after ordering. Great job
B00SCNLAZG|2|These are not a good choice for motorcycle riding, at least not for cruiser style bikes where you are sitting straight up. They block most of your view down on the bike and pavement. When I'm riding my bike in normal position with these on I can't see any of the gauges or indicator lights. I have to tilt my head down a good 20 degrees to be able to see any of that. They simply cover too much of my field of view to the point that I felt unsafe.<br /><br />Also, they have air holes that do a nice job at keeping them clear of fog, but depending on your head position the wind comes through the holes and it hit me right in the eye, so again I found myself tipping my head down to avoid this annoying issue.<br /><br />I finally gave them to my son to use them for playing.<br /><br />Other than that the quality is good. They do have the retro look I was hoping for, but again, not safe to ride motorcycles.
B0024E2S0U|5|as described but slightly shorter than a standard RV door (there is a gap) -- they should make them 12&#34; x 12.&#34; or 12&#34; by 12.25&#34;
B00E1GEM2G|2|This bright 16w Cree LED light is advertised as a 30 deg. spot. It is, in fact, an 8 deg. spot (as labeled on the box).  I waited almost a month for this item to be shipped from China. I could have ordered an 8 deg. spot from here in N. America, but I really wanted a 30 deg. light for my application.  Coming from a company in China, and with nearly a month for shipping, there are limited complaint options.  I guess I'll just have to suck it up and make do until iI can find another light that really fits my need.
B00FYZSIF0|5|Great fit my 94 mercruiser 3.o perfect
B009FIDSNO|5|Very cute and fun.
B0065S6S8Y|5|Direct replacement for what I needed on my Trailblazer.
B00MLKCGGI|4|Great cheap helmet good shipping it looks good and works ok
B006ONRS9I|5|Great fit  and strong !
B00GN66YAK|1|garbage
B0000AY0KB|4|works on mine
B001EOYIRW|5|The hitch arrived on time and sooner than promised.  There is a you-tube video that walks you through the installation process and it is easy to follow.  The hitch uses all of the existing mounting points and requires no drilling.  A friend and I installed it in under an hour.
B00ESQQZ2O|2|There are better combos out there. Pay a little more and get a better brand.
B009FNWGHI|5|They  look great
B00IAVCZGS|4|gave my car that sporty look.. very nice
B000BGHSNK|5|Original water flange was broken and leaking.  Replaced it with this one and It works like new now.  This is just what I was looking for.  Would recommend to others.
B00SLKQGF4|4|Plain looking and sturdy.  I was not looking for chrome and flashy,  my only two complaints are the instructions could have been a little better, and the hardware under the step side is gold color and stand out when you look at the truck from 10 feet or more away.  I would still buy it if I has another truck that needed one.
B000VL6AHU|5|I bought this for a 2010 Subaru Outback and it's the right part.  I know Toyota owns some % of Subaru now and I'm sure they are sharing some parts by now.<br />I change cabin filters yearly, and I used the Wix filter for my first change.  I bought a subaru-branded filter from a dealer for twice (thrice, perhaps) the price and the Wix feels much more substantial.  The OEM part is flimsy by comparison.  Well, I won't make that mistake again.  Wix from now on.
B00MC6RQAM|5|As bright as I needed them to be. Used for stop lights and reverse lights. Works great!
B000SL4AA2|4|Works pretty good and fits in my cargo area on my four wheeler.
B000MJ269W|5|I have several automotive flags, BMW, ///M, Audi, etc.<br />This is the highest quality and largest of them all, except one and very comparable to a MUCH more expensive flag.<br />Great seller!
B00IYTZ20C|5|great transaction just as described
B000EVWDU0|4|Works great!
B001J839WS|4|a little thin
B000LJPXNY|1|Received winch but nothing on said it was from viper, box just said made in China.  Instructions were worthless.  Used winch twice before it went up in smoke.  I dont believe its made for any serious off road use.
B000AA8G5G|5|Works great!
B005LD2ONC|2|I purchased 2 of these units at different times.  One of them works fine but the other one works about 1/2 the time.  Radio Shack sells one that has a rocker switch with a small green light on it for $10.  Do yourself a favor and get the Radio Shack unit.  It is built better and the small green light is not blinding like the one listed here.  The Radio Shack unit also works 100% of the time!
B00MMELJOS|5|easy to program and use
B00EAOIRI4|5|Fit perfectly in 13 Honda Fit.  Why pay $60 at the dealer to install this when you can do this at home in less than 3 minutes and pay less than $20.
B00586XXHS|4|cheap helmet, but who cares. Keeps you safe, looks good, and does the job well. LOL at the chumps paying $300+ for helmets when these will get you there. Why buy a Royce for your commute to work when a Corolla will do the job for less?
B007EXNB2U|4|It's a descent replacement for an RV door. It's probably best for light use.
B007P14NPU|1|like many reviews before me, I should have done my research and read reviews before purchase... was defective out of baggy, like stated before. Tried with Torque, Carista, and OBDLink apps and none could connect. Carista app is the one that claimed it defective with a pop up message.<br /><br />edit 5/26/15: looks like they will refund your money in exchange for a better rating. (However I'm pretty sure that type of exchange is not allowed in Amazon's review guidelines) But for the good of future consumers, I stand by my principle decision. I even spent a little extra to get the BAFX OBDII unit. It is a lot bigger, but is less likely to be defective according to the forum that lead me to this product: http://priuschat.com/threads/carista-obd-ii-application-rocks-now-updated-4-30-2015.138460/page-13#post-2168266
B00CP6K0CA|5|Looks good and fits well
B00EC0ZD4W|5|Exactly as described. Comes with backing plate and easy to follow instructions.
B004I0LL5Q|5|The marker arrived on time. It came with a bulb and socket.<br />LED replacement bulbs fit fine inside<br />Fit perfectly in the driver side front of a 2006 G35X Sedan.
B00JJBWMDO|5|Great and easy
B0041TOPY8|5|I was expecting it to be a cheap poorly made knockoff that wouldn't even work with the electric component, but was very surprised to find that it works perfectly for only about $25! A genuine Ford part used runs at about $70! Highly recommend going with this and saving about 50 dollars. The front is shiny so it may not match your other mirror if it's vinyl instead.
B000CPCBEQ|5|I put this in 1998 Jeep Cherokee AX-15 manual trans. Shifts into second much easier. Smoother shifts and better overall operation.
B00J2CI6OY|1|Didn't kno they even worked when I turned them on at night... Not worth buying them at all! I'm returning them... The seller was on top of everything and is wonderful to deal with but just not the right product description at all...
B000PA00XM|5|Nice product. Easy to install
B000C3XD90|5|Love these K&N Filters.
B000FQ1IWS|5|Most times I have gone out on trips with my full doors.  Quite often the internal struggle whether to bring them or not would go something like this:<br /><br />\\"It's not supposed to rain.\\"<br /><br />\\"Yeah, but what if it does - it's two hours on the road and it will really stink if it's raining and the doors are leaning against the wall in the garage and not on the Jeep!\\"<br /><br />Or I would go out for an overnight trip and decide to remove the doors, but be forced to leave them in camp.  This wasn't nearly as problematic (though it did sometimes result in later wishing I had them along) but I always had the nagging fear they'd be gone when I returned.  Anyone who's priced full steel doors from Jeep lately knows that the insurance company would not be very happy to hear from me, and I would not be very happy with either the cost of replacing them myself or paying the surcharge on the insurance.<br /><br />So most of the time I just left the doors on, sometimes happy I did when the weather turned, but often wishing I had half doors that I could stow on board and use them only when needed.<br /><br />I watched regular steel half doors sell all day long on eBay for $600 or more.  I even refinished a set for my friend Carl.<br /><br />Then I found the perfect solution.  Warrior Products makes a half door that is compatible with my soft uppers.  So after staring at them in the catalog all winter long, I finally bought them.<br /><br />I chose to get the black ones and the brackets required to install the uppers.<br /><br />These doors lend themselves to several modifications.  I bought high-quality weatherstripping, Stainless Steel hardware, aftermarket mirrors, check-straps and footman loops, and storage compartments to mount on the inside of the doors.  All assembled, they work very well.  I can remove them while I am on the road and either put them on top of my roof rack or in the back of the Jeep.  You can't do that with full or half-steel doors!<br /><br />The material is very thick and the powder coat is very good.  I would recommend upgrading the hardware if you care at all about appearance.  Also, using acorn nuts inside protects you from injury from exposed bolts.<br /><br />I highly recommend the upper door mounting brackets.  Check the photos for an idea about how they attach.  When I bought these, I couldn't find instructions anywhere so I had to \\"figure it out\\".  Hopefully these photos will help!s! <br /> <br />The material is very thick and the powder coat is very good.  I would recommend upgrading the hardware if you care at all about appearance.

B004ASWEGQ|5|Very nice setup. Shipping was very fast!  Came in less than 3 days.  The subs were easily to install and hit hard.  Only thing that could've been beter is if it would've included speaker wire.
B00DSD4YW6|5|Was delivered really fast and the sticker is great.
B001C956SE|5|very satisfied
B008032QSI|1|came very quickly and was made well but it DOES NOT fit in my truck. i installed it and when i went to go get gas, the handle kept click off. the problem is that the new one has a rubber neck inside and the old one has a steel neck, the inner neck to allow air flow out was getting pinched because of the angle and wasnt allowing it to release vapors. not happy with it
B0018GVUJ0|5|Amazing sound and price!
B006X98A7C|5|The battery was a perfect fit.  It arrived in a charged condition.
B000O5EFNY|5|I bought because I needed it for working on my guns. It worked very well. especially on red dot sights
B00230QR3E|5|I am the first reviewer, and I had never heard of Emgo. The delivered product was an exact replacement. From everything I could see it is an OEM replacement for my 1979 Suzuki GS1000E. My old filter was incredibly dirty and I was able to notice a positive difference right away. I would recommend this filter to friends.
B000IBU9QG|1|I would have rated this a 3-4 stars but the quality is poor. There are no strings or bands to tie the middle part at the bend (of a chair). This thing looks super wack. It is not black, rather, it looks like black beads with dust or white dots on it. I use this in my car which has luxury interior but the beads ruined it. There's a ton of wood chips on the bottom of my chair! The brown ones are made way better.
B002ML8D7C|5|I ordered a  couple of these after my mom passed away. They came out beautifully.
B005M16QY6|4|Really nice and super comfortable
B00CAMCDL0|2|Its very big for an antenna and the wire comes out of the back not out of the bottom and the adhesive pads that were given won't hold it down to the roof 3m adhesive is necessary
B000NCOKV0|5|I have two Harley Electra Glides hooked to it and it works like a charm.  Could not ask for more
B00086I67K|5|Nice upgrade for your car. It's the small details that count when customizing your car.
B005J6JRMM|5|I needed an extension for my existing seat belt fastener because the catch for the fastener kept coming off whenever I tried to attach the seat belt.  I knew somewhere there was such a gadget.  Behold, I searched in the internet and found such an item which I had been looking for!!!  MAHALO!!!  (THANK YOU)<br /><br />Stan H
B00KN0UOEE|5|Recommended by most white water outfitters for protection on all plastic equipment.
B00A740VQM|5|The bits DO fit in the main handle. It's (the main handle), not magnetic like the extensions are, but has a collar to tighten to hold the bits or either extension. For the money, the quality is fine and an outstanding value.
B000EVWDU0|5|I compared the readout against another digital meter, and it was spot on. I have driven with the meter in two cars to get a sense of battery condition. It's easy to read from various angles. I like it a lot.
B0030BBHSU|5|K & N Race Spec. air filter matched it with my Graves slip-on exhaust and PC5. This thing increases the bikes torque dramatically. Worth the money .
B00E1D1GY6|5|Driving and sewing have never been easier! I work as a tailor for an alterations company, and this work surface tray makes it easier than ever to work on the go. My sewing machine is a little bulky for the tray, so I had to purchase 2 of them, and tape them together and rest one side on my drivers door arm rest, but after the quick fix I've been able to get loads of work done during my 1 hour commute!!! The only problem I have run into, is sometimes I mistake the sewing machine foot pedal for the gas/break and has caused some minor traffic situations and on the rare occasion some fatalities. I hope for the sake of my car that I can soon purchase a hand pedal for my sewing machine, because I don't know how many more light poles my car can hit without voiding my 2 year warranty. Other than that I am very happy with the product and can't see myself driving without it. Thanks a lot AutoExec!
B00K65IK0G|1|Did nothing but waste mone .
B001J8M80C|5|Great product fit my car very well and came with the clips to hold them didn't expect that
B00C1EO6BC|5|Installed and seems to be working great good quality
B002XL4WN0|5|We have used the wheel covers and the look great and I am sure they will hold up.  thank you very much now I have used up my words required
B008M7NC76|5|Great investment because with the 3 yr warranty, I wasn't worried about spending the money to have it professionally lettered in white to advertise my business and phone number. I prefer the elastic system to the zipper system because the material rotted away at the zipper on my old one and on my husband's the zipper broke. The elastic stays on through the weather and traveling. I am happy with my purchase. I am glad I didn't buy one with Honda wording because this is serving two purposes for me so I can justify the expense as business.
B000CKRWL8|4|will not work with the CURT 45791 2&#34; Receiver Extender. The extender is solid metal.
B0015BINLG|4|got it really fast and for a great price. looks great on my truck. my truck looks hard and more aggressive.
B000WFQYBC|5|Easy installation.
B00O28W0L8|4|Fit nice. Only one issue. When removed to wipe water under them after washing the car,  one velcro tab pulled away from the protector and remained stuck to the carpet. Cannot re-take velcro back to door sill protector.
B002MOEDDW|5|I installed my fog lamps yesterday. The packaging included everything I needed to do the job right. The instructions are not very informative, be prepared. The light pattern is exactly what I needed on my 4x4 van.
B008QHSRR2|5|Very cool. Worth every penny!
B00AO0E5QQ|4|Nice set of pry tools.  The only problem is that the blade is a little blunt to wedge it between parts that are really tight, like around the car's stereo.  But works fine on the body panels.
B004YKK88Q|4|nice and short. looks great on my all-black r53.<br /><br />no noticeable difference in radio reception.
B00B1VBQRS|5|all as expected
B000E2ARDO|5|K &N is the best brand from all of my choice. My GS 500F only take FARM, OEM or K&N, compare all three oil filter you can tell sightly different between of those. The oil filter I only trust K &N for my bike.
B00BD4SJBO|5|These are an excellent brand of seat covers and very reasonable price wise!! Very stylish,and they fit well on the bucket seats in my truck!!!! I will look to order from this company again when I need automotive accessories for my vehicle! I am very pleased!!!!!
B000BGHSNK|5|Fixed my problem!
B004X5QKD4|5|Fit perfectly and install it within 15 minutes in my Honda Civic HB 98
B004X29ZJ8|3|its ok. the picture as began to fade not too long after i got it. but all in all is fun to drive with
B004RT4PMO|5|excellent!
B000BZG72E|5|Xlnt. Perfect fit.
B00II7TROM|5|Nice product, speedy delivery.be sure to purchase a new gasket though.did I mention affordable?
B008YUE5M2|5|A top shelf filter.
B001U6DMSK|3|The back part of the  seat covers do not fit and can only cover the bottomseats. The front ones match the car well. the headrests covers are not fitting properly..loose
B002W0ZNIU|5|premixed with the bonding agent. let it dry and polished with micro fiber towel.<br />nice deep shine and should last 6 months easy.
B002OUMU66|5|Perfect
B00C5SSWPA|5|A++
B00KCEXZ42|5|I bought this for my mom. She has a hard time keeping her farmers market stuff together & I got tired of the plastic grocery sacs in her car. She loves it & it looks cute!
B000B1I0F0|5|it has a very wide view, i got it for my fiance and he loves it!
B009J6AAGU|5|Fabulous
B0006MQIY4|5|Arrived quickly and as described. It has all of the essentials for a small first aide pack for your car or gym bag.
B00G1Y279Q|3|Not bad for the money. Work great, but the paint faded after 1 riding season.
B00AMLQ6HS|5|Very easy installation instructions.  I took about an hour and a half to install both sides on my 2014 RAM 3500 crew cab; I could have installed them in less time, but I had no reason to hurry.  Everything fit perfectly.  They are heavy and the quality appears to be very good.  I especially like the finished ends that are sealed stainless and not filled with plastic or rubber plugs like so many others.
B00EFH8OX4|4|It looks very nice on My car and I like it.
B008FOGE3U|5|A breeze to install, looks like the factory did it! And I'm no mechanic. Worth every penny!
B0009OR94M|5|I used this gauge for setting the valve lash on my Cummins ISB 6.7 after installing ARP head studs.  I was very impressed with the overall quality and price.  This set performed as well as any of my feeler sets from Matco or Snap On.
B00F17Q87G|5|Perfect for RV use. Used as an extension cord for longer reach. No problems yet. Quality cord.
B00BTGDR9A|5|Very nice kit. every pad you need for detailing your favorite ride
B001N2O3PM|5|I thought this was going to be plastic, like the broken one I replaced.  However, I was pleasantly surprised, by a metal Chrome plated license frame!<br />Fast shipping, and fits perfectly, and strong.  I'm very happy with this purchase, but, it's a Bell Automotive product, and I've always been happy with their products.
B0027Z49CG|2|May not be fair to judge it so low as it may just be a mismatch for my trailer.  But didn't like that it did not extend very far before coming unstable.
B00ABPQQRA|5|I've had a blast with this item, Always been a fan of Boba Fett and just start getting into collecting decals like this one here. Fast service as well as a great price. Well Done!
B00062ZXSG|5|Fits perfect and looks great !!! I can tell that this will probably keep me from having to clean my filter as often.
B000CPJMH0|5|Great product, even better than the ones I used to buy at the parts stores, and cheaper by far. Great
B00E1SMA1E|3|A ton of marketing effort went into the selling of these brakes. Regardless of ALL of that, here is a simple way to describe it from the consumer's point of view.  The rotors appear to be nothing special. They are what is known as &#34;white box&#34; rotors. They show up in a white cardboard box in which they are bagged in an oily plastic bag. The rotors do NOT have a ground non-directional finish as shown in the photo. They have an average turned finish. NOWHERE is an reference to the name &#34;Callahan&#34; on either the rotors or pads, boxes, or parts. The rotors are labeled as &#34;auto specialties&#34; if I remember right, and the pad's box is labeled &#34;powerstop&#34;. They are made in CHINA. One answer I got prior to buying on amazon was that they were made in USA but that is incorrect. Too bad, just a previous customer giving wrong info, or is it??  So, with all the differences from what is marketed to what I received, I emailed back to ensure I received the correct order. It was stated that I did get the right parts and that's just how it's done to keep prices down. The brakes work fine and that is probably the most important info to someone purchasing, just be aware that the slick ads for these brakes make them sound like they are some kind of &#34;super brake&#34;. Bottom line is ok price for ok brakes. No smoke screen necessary. I do have a slight low speed squeal but it is rare that a brake squeal will last more than a few hundred miles. I attribute it to the pads being a little too loose in the brackets because of the rust removal that's necessary to make sure they slide ok. My problem not the brakes. As a side note; Wouldn't it be a nice feature to have an icon on each item page indicating what products are MADE IN USA?  A flag or something? just an idea.<br /><br />4/2015 Just an update. The noise has been gone for a while now and the brakes stop fine. Pedal feel is good too. I took away 2 stars only because of the marketing balony which tended to misrepresent what I was purchasing.nt what I was purchasing.
B000C8ZB1I|2|Amazon was perfect shipping this to me etc. etc.  They always have done right by me.  However...<br /><br />As far is this part is concerned I would go with the OEM part even if it is a little more expensive.  If you don't care about your vehicle that much and you just want a quick, cheap fix this will work for you.<br />I purchased this for my 2001 Jeep Cherokee Sport<br />Here are my issues with this part:<br />1) The metal base that gets bolted to the vehicle is not coated in any way.  This will start to rust immediately.  The OEM part has a nice black epoxy finish.  The reason you are replacing the old one in the first place is because it most likely was rusted.<br />2) The bolts that protrude through from the bottom are two mild steel bolts that have two tack welds holding them in place.  The problem with using the threw bolts like that is that it will never sit flush up against the 'frame' where it attaches.  This means water will sit up there, rust the part, and the frame.  The OEM part uses studs that have been recessed into the metal part and are completely flush with the back side.  In all the places I researched the Walker part you never see the tops of those bolts in the pictures (pretty sneaky).<br />3) This part comes dissembled.  The OEM part comes assembled.<br /><br />I hope this helps the next person make the correct choice. There are lots of places to buy Mopar parts online, I would start there you can get the part number from any parts place or your service manual.  I'm all for saving money on parts but this one is IMHO inferior to the OEM part.
B009AQS4IU|5|The daisy plate frame just arrived today.  I was surprised when I saw that the four corner daisies were painted with white and yellow. On the Amazon picture, it looks to be all chrome, no painting.  After that surprise, I found the frame to be of very good quality and will put it on my car today. I bought the design because it looks cheerful not too showy, if you know what I mean! Reminds me of happy times in San Francisco in the 60's, and that isn't bad! I think the picture should reflect the painted flowers so people know.

B008KNBZPS|5|This was a perfect fit for my 2004 Volkswagen passat gls 1.8T ,  I just installed it and its working just fine. I can sure feel the difference, it's not giving off heat through my ac vents anymore ,drives like a new car . It took me about almost two hrs or less to install, I had to take the front bumper off to take the old one out and get this new one in. I had to reset my emissions light by taking off the red post off of my battery after installing the air pump. I've drove it for three days now and hasn't came back on so far . I will rate 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
B003RWV6DS|5|Worked as Advertised
B008I7OQ84|5|perfect replacement for my old mirror whose inner motor wasn't working properly. ships fast and packed quite well. highly recommended if you are looking for this!
B002X9TNFE|1|just got the stickers . they are ^6 X3. .? cheap but smaller than they are saying ! will not buy from them again !
B000AXWU5A|5|Tough, durable, and washable, these floor mats nevertheless are meant to get dirty--and they do.  However, with each scuff and smudge, Tink's pouting proclamation that she's no princess simply takes on real attitude.  In a word, whoever designed this put a great deal of thought into it, making something which with use becomes more and more engaging.
B001P11SF4|5|This plugged right in to my 02 F250 super duty.  Works great!
B004OFK9PS|5|The sunshades look great and fit perfectly standing them on the short side and using the length to cover the entire windshield up and down.  I fold down my car's sun visors to hold the sunshades in place.  Very good quality.  Don't know how they will hold up over time, but so far so good.  Would purchase again.
B009VYWIMO|5|Really helps to see behind you. I have it attached to a piece of machinery so I can see where I am backing it better.
B008G6W9XQ|4|Fit the four wheeler perfect right one
B001G648I2|4|Two mechanics charged me to lower the idle in my Mercedes 300E, without success. Then I noticed that the old micro switch seemed to have a warn spot on it. I replaced it with this unit in less than 5 minutes, and solved my high idle problems.<br /><br />Best deal ever!
B000GZX9K2|5|Perfect battery, no issues what's so ever.
B004GFTC0E|5|Just follow the directions. I was able to use my cordless drill and swap out the battery as needed. Lights are back to brand new. THE most important thing......don't rush it, be picky and don't skip steps. This kit works like a champ!
B00MU24RCI|5|Soooo cute. Good quality! Lots of compliments.
B001AZTOL0|5|Please with item. Ordered a second set for backup.
B00AVM61LY|4|The first paint I received seemed a little diluted.  Had to apply a few times for full coverage. The included first brush was bigger than would be good for touch up.  I contacted them and they sent me a second batch promptly with a much smaller touch-up brush the second time. Overall, I'm happy with this product.
B00BTO0BGO|4|The lights work good and fit my car with no problem, they also look great on my car. My maxmia looks nice with the new lights.
B000C9EMQM|2|Returned, wrong part.
B00AXMSWAK|5|works perfect
B003TOFMLQ|5|I have to say , this my first time changing a water pump that is used as a tensioner ! And without this tool it would have been a pain in the A$$ ! It worked like it supposed to , and I got the job done. Recommend this tool especially if you have a chevy aveo...
B000CGR4AG|5|Put these on my E36 325i, installation was cake. They definitely require some bedding in, but now they're fantastic. I have crappy bottle cap rims that are a pain in the ass to clean, but now they barely dust up. Car looks fresher, longer. Will certainly put these on the rear as well.
B008RDL78G|2|Horrible instructions.  Used instructions from other reviewers and was able to install these fairly quickly.  Stripped 2 bolts during installation.  Drove the car today and super loud wind noise - other reviewers mentioned this and turned them around.  I installed them with the wide part in front as others suggested.  I will try to replace the bolts to see if that helps but if not then I am definitely returning these - just too loud.
B002R0XNZK|2|Good & Bad news.  Got a refund without returning the part.  BUT...even though I ordered the drivers side and the passenger side, the drivers side lamp was not the right part.  I just used the drop box to select the same part for drivers side and passenger side, but some how got one right and one wrong part.  Maybe a glitch in the ordering system has wrong part cross-referenced.  I re-ordered drivers side turn signal through amazon (different seller) we will see if I get the right part this time.
B00F0M82Z8|5|Very nice, reasonably priced
B00KWQRC4O|3|product as stated other than the tissue holder is not the size of any current tissue boxes.

B003TSOQY6|4|works as intended.  needs external battery jump start machine with a aux outlet on it to plug it in.  will not work with pre 1995 vehicles though.
B001QV2UNW|3|got injectors today from order to delivery 10 days, the price was so good i thought it was a great deal they wer a bit rusty, ends should be capped some were some were not ,imworred are they good??? looked like old stock put in e-450 a hell of a lot of work to install 6.0. injectors, will update if go bad imworried.
B005ZS1VXM|5|Perfect fit, very clean, has everything you need to replace the glass. As suggested elsewhere, it is actually pretty challenging to remove the old glass safely - it breaks off in small pieces and it stuck on there well. Gloves and glasses are necessary and do it over a big trash can. A butter knife and small hammer helped a lot. Also, consider the full replacement (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004GCD3NY?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=ox_sc_sfl_title_2&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER) for a few dollars more instead of just replacing the broken glass. I wish I had done that. It looks very easy to install of you can disconnect that little harness.
B00BLKXW9O|5|Shipped fast as described
B00736OY38|5|Top notch customer service and products
B00BITI91E|4|Loved the price speed everything about it.<br />Still doesnt help with installation very complex for novice.<br />I have a chev. Van w/electric locks, windows, mirrors.<br />I watched several youtube videos before I proceeded.<br />Took pictures at each step for reffrence. including wire connectors etc.<br />did miss pic for rods conecting to inner door latch. locking mech. and the handle.<br />Okay unless you accidentally disconect your rods while installing the new handle like I did.<br />Also recomend reviewing the video again right before reinstall for right conecting order.<br />I did mine backwards and broke the plastic piece for the lock (connect first)<br />So I actually had to use the piece for my new one from the old piece.<br />then used a tiny nail like a cotter pin to hold it in place after drilling micro hole to insert nail.<br />Its done together working good.<br />Nothing wrong with the product just the installer.
B0042PS5N8|5|Freaking loved it. Have to be careful when applying, you can mess it up and have creases and bubbles. Loved mine! GO BRONCOS!
B000RXNLK6|4|Good product
B0023UPORY|4|arrived on time without cracks. every possible combination of measurements on cups to make sure you get the right mix every time.
B0002NILQ0|5|came in timely manner was exactly what I wanted with a little effort I thought it was 2 small but finally got it to fit thought is was goanna bust. but it didn't looks great
B00NVQQGFI|4|I bought this for my 2014 316i  Turbo Charge BMW and it looks great like something out of a fast and furious movie<br />but tow are showing brighter than the other is there a sequence in which they are installed or you can put anyone in any of the doors.
B002U1V3FS|5|The other day I was driving with my new Cthulhu fish on the back of my car, and a man with red eyes and black robes flagged me down and gave me a card that said &#34;P̢̢h̴͘̕͜͟'͟͏̀͜͞n̶̡̨g̢̡l͏͞҉̀͏u̵͜͝i̡̡͟ ҉̵̡m̛҉ģ̧͝l̕͢w̨͟'̢͡n̷̷̡͘͞a̶̧̛̕f̕h̴͘͠҉͏ ̶͏͢C̵͞͝t̵͜h̕͠͏u̕̕͟͡҉l͏̵͜͝h̕͡u̕͝͞ ̕͡͝R̴̵̛'̛̀͘ĺ҉̡y̸̸̵͠e̷̵͘h̷́͏ ̶̵̴̡ẁ̛̛͢͡g͏͡á̵̸͡h̷͟'̷̸̧̀͡n̴̕a̴̷̧g̵̡̀l̶̶͏҉ ̸̧́f҉̶h̶̶҉t͢͟a̶̡͜g̡͡ņ̴̡&#34; and since then everything has been going my way. I've gotten a raise at work from that fat and sweaty mouthbreather of a boss who always stinks of prawns, and that hot girl from accounting asked me out and took me on the best date of my life paying for everything because it turns out her dad is some wealthy squid tycoon or something. Tonight she is taking me to her church for some kind of full moon party and she says it's something I will always remember. Thanks, Cthulhu fish!
B001QYSXAS|5|This antenna works well and i like how it stays out of view. Very pleased with the product and shipping was fast.
B000EQ6AKE|4|The exhaust manifold fit perfect and I saved alot of money. It was short 2@ bolts, but they were common and I picked them up locally.
B001KY0GQ8|3|The lights are OK, although they cannot be considered truly fog lights. In addition, these are not xenon lamps as described but halogen. The blue parking lights equipped are worthless.
B0047R81JE|4|These are high quality spokes at a great price<br />I bought these for my sons CRF150<br />We were changing to the big wheel verison<br />They fit perfectly

B007Y557TI|5|This thing works great and fits like a glove on my car.  (I bought one for each car.)  Clearly a quality product.  I can tell a significant temp difference inside the car when I use this.

B000C3HBX4|5|Works excellent! Easy to install. Arrived quickly.
B000CPCC4U|5|Put on my pop up camper and this set was 1/2 the price of any other brand.  Install was easy and fit was perfect.  I was done in 1/2 hour and now have confidence my bearings will last longer.
B0026N52SY|5|Worked Awesome !!!!!!  Thank You .
B008RIEQXY|3|when these lights arrived i attempted to install them on my bike and only one of the lights worked.  i was extremely disappointed by this so i contacted the seller and they offered to refund part of the cost of the product which i was ok with because it wasnt an expensive product to begin with. the one light that did work worked very well and i will probably buy another set since the price was so reasonable. juse be careful and remember &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;.
B00IICYTDG|5|Just what I needed. Fit perfectly, shipping was great and on time. Ordered another for our second bike.
B0044AVY2A|5|Exactly as described and fast shipping. Very pleased.
B0043CSS46|4|Works as advertised. I am just a do-it- yourselfer and the only complaint is the pamphlet does not tell you what all the little codes are in the black circles in the top left corner. Spent a few minutes on the web and figured it out for the few I was looking at.  I have not connected this scan tool up to the web yet as I use apple laptops and haven't sat down to see if it will run the program.  Guess I should just take over the kids gaming computer for a few to see what else is wrong with my vehicle!
B000GZEK00|4|Good price. Quick delivery, right sensor for my car, easy to install, and engine running smoothly with improved gas mileage. I estimate 2mi/gal improvement. That's it. Short and sweet.
B008RAD3NG|5|Works as advertised,  a snap to use without the hassle of RTV
B001MU5LNS|5|Excellent and flawless product. Installed in a roots type supercharged 2.2L ecotec motor Cavalier. No gap required. No issues whatsoever. Car runs amazing.
B00BDJB0AG|1|does not fit as intended. attach is a bracket not a screw in.
B000BUQODG|5|These were very easy to install, and are working great.  I can  now leave the roof vents open 24/7 and the trailer is not roasting hot when i go in after sitting out in the sun.<br /><br />I would definately recommend these to everyone who own's a camper.
B0055ELS6G|5|lool
B001A0J2JO|2|This Clip on Wide Angle Rear view Mirror did not fit my current rear view mirror which has a command center for On Star, Phone and Garage Door Openers.<br />It is a good looking rear view mirror for standard cars that do not have a thick mirror.
B0009Z3YKE|5|Recently I just bought a Grand Cherokee 2004 and I felt like the interior needed that little extra something. I saw these online and purchased them on the spot. They are so heavy duty and really personalized the interior! Great for any Jeep fan! Highly recommend!
B001GN3D1S|5|Work just fine.Great price!
B0017OFS3C|5|fits perfectly and lights up when i switch on headlamps
B00DNU3OAM|5|Great quality terminals! These allow larger gauge battery cables and they arent cheap like the standard black and red generic terminals. Theyre a little on the heavy side, but they are built to last.
B004LYDZXK|4|Hi there.  When I ordered the Solenoid, it came on time and was packaged well.  I was using a warn type solenoid before.  This one has bigger electrical posts.  It's obviously shaped a little different than the normal warn type soenoid, but was an easy substitute, at a much better price. It seems to work well.  I'll have to use it for some time, to see how well it holds up. The old solenoid used four bolts to hold it on. This one used two. But I turned it a little and it matched up two of the old bolt holes.
B001AZWGHO|4|I bought this for my motorcycle and rode 400 miles last weekend. Works good and arrived as described. I have it on a Yamaha Stratoliner.
B000CD8HH8|5|I never thought much about my windshield wipers. But I put one of these blades on my left wiper and it has held up much longer than the previous blade that was on the new car. The blade clears the water well with no streaking. Will buy again.
B008BRJ5FA|5|Fits my 2012 Rubicon fog lamps without issue.  Jeep fogs are a pain to change however these fit perfectly and are exactly the same as stock and the light output matches.  Hard to find this bulb anywhere else.
B001IGBIAG|4|Good length, but the cross slats are too wide to keep smaller wheels from falling thru.  I had to get some cheap aluminum and screw it to the ramps to fill in the spaces.  It's okay, works out just fine!
B001QUYML6|4|Just received these \\"red\\" coil packs. As mentioned, these are not OEM R8 coil packs, no part number 06E-905-115-E stamped on the packs.    Came in Intermotor box and surprisingly, made in Japan.     Yet to install them, so not sure if they performed as well as the original Audi R8 coils. For few dollars cheaper, may be better idea to just buy from Audi or HS Tuning.    Please check the coil packs carefully, found 1 coil with end slightly bended. Seems to have been dropped or hit. Had to bend it back, and hope it works fine.    Will report back after installing them.
B00BCR7B7K|3|it did not fit on the Acura. Also it is not the best quality.  As i mentioned in a previous rating, you need to re-inforce the seems in order for the seat covers to really work.
B007T9ER5O|1|dis not work
B000FLR1PQ|5|I purchased these to replace lost pieces from a Hazet set and was pleased with the quality. I travel for work and these are perfect to keep in my tool box.
B000GRS2ZM|5|I needed a windshield on my 86 fazer after finding out how much armstrain you can get while at higher speeds. It is somewhat forgiving on installation, and with stem cutting, it can fit nearly any bar setup. It has taken some big rock hits just fine, and stays snug even up to 120mph.
B00CG5RYEW|5|Love it! Everyone thinks its funny
B00JTZ2L4A|5|Did what it was supposed to do.  Just be sure that you plan your accesory purchases carfully.  I now have two of these becuse the Polaris winch kit also includes one.
B00COYNWLY|5|Gives me Jedi powers!
B00DYVZCN2|1|Purchased this battery for my Harley Sportster in May left on June the 20th for a trip on my bike. Got a 110  miles from home and the battery opened up and lost all power.  Had to trade battery in and get another battery so I could continue on my trip. When I removed the battery there was corrosion on negative terminal. Don't by I'm out  $48.74 and my new battery cost me over $120.  So don't buy this battery or you'll be sorry like me.
B007B86Z94|2|Very cheap product. Of the 3 installed 2 quit working within a few weeks. Get what you pay for I guess.
B000KL1JU4|5|You can hang it from the mirror or place it on the antenna.  I feel is is a little overpriced but unusual.
B00AGAENF2|1|1 led didnt work it came with missing screws and loose screws<br />Bad quality
B008HRKJMM|3|the remote is perfect but the key keep getting stuck and cannot get it programme so  i have mix rection about this
B0097SUKL0|5|This is a solid shackle for my Warn bumper that sits on my Wrangler. I had to be pulled out of the mud once, and it held on nicely. Good piece of metal.
B0007N207G|4|In early 2004, I installed a pair of the DesignTech 50 watt halogen back-up light bulbs in our 2003 GMC Sierra Denali.  We tow a fifth wheel travel trailer with this truck.  These light bulbs provide noticeably more light when backing up the trailer and are also helpful when backing just the truck in unfamiliar surroundings. The left bulb failed in January, 2006, and I installed a new DesignTech bulb at that time.  The same left side bulb has just failed again in April, 2013.<br /><br />Interestingly, the bulb filament did not fail.  Rather, the heat from the bulb gradually cooked the base of the bulb until it failed.  The now-brittle base of the bulb disintegrated when I tried to remove it from the socket. Fortunately, the heat did no apparent damage to the bulb socket. And, the remnants of the bottom of the original bulb were easily removed from the socket with needle nose pliers. I have now installed a new DesignTech bulb, and we are again operational.  And, note the original right side bulb from 2004 is still functional.<br /><br />As in most things, compromise is an operative word here. These halogen bulbs do provide more light and more heat.  As the instructions state, do not leave the vehicle in reverse for more than a few minutes to maximize the life of the bulbs.  And, even then, I believe that you are likely to see the bulbs eventually fail from excessive heat.
B0051NN86Y|5|I was very satisfied with my purchase
B009AA8JUE|5|Good product. No more CEL.
B0081GLU40|5|Bulbs were very easy to install and lights up my interior, trunk and license plate brightly. Well worth the price!
B004QI0FCK|5|I was a little hesitant, only because my mower puts out 40 amps? But I received the Regulator, and put it in, did all the tests, and it works GREAT! The battery even charges at an idle with no lights on, and as long as the mower is running at high R.P.Ms. it will not over charge! A lot better than spending $90.00 on the O.E.M. part.
B002M4CBK4|5|The DuraShield Travel Motorcycle cover is an excellent value. This product is very highly recommended.
B00MLI6OHC|5|Beautiful light, and extremely bright.
B00FO7JET2|1|The odor of this steering wheel cover is really strong, after a while it kind of gives you a headache. It leaves your hand smelly with whatever this thing is made of. I really don't recommend it. BUY A DIFFERENT PRODUCT!!!! You don't want to make the inside of your car smell bad either, which now my car does. I drove like less than 15 minutes and after washing my hands you can still smell the odor of this cover.
B002SLIU6K|4|ordered this for my 2003 Tahoe and it matches the pewter grey very well. after watching the youtube how to video I was able to install this in less than 20 minutes. does make it easier if you have a friend to assist with removal of the arm rest. very satisfied with this cover as the arm rest looks brand new again.
B009D1CM1W|4|Ordered for a 98 gsx-r 750. Bike used mostly to commute to and from work. Pads work good for the price. Nothing amazing but will stop the bike
B004JPLLSC|3|Cable didn't fit at first, no matter what i tried. I ended up having to cut half the spring off so that it would reach. It has been a week and I haven't had any troubles with it so far.

B00NGOY54E|5|Perfect fit & match. Extremely installation!
B000FQ7QWE|5|I have a 1976 CJ5 and this dash piece fit right where the old factory dash pad fit. Heavier than expected but all good so far
B000CODPF6|5|Very well built stands for heavy duty applications. I used these for my GMC Topkick and they work perfect. Easy to lower when weight is off the stands. Thinking about buying 2 more
B011JA8BVE|5|Holiday day shipping is received late, the quality is also good, prices are very satisfied, I want to buy again when the next opportunity.
B006G2MJZU|5|Excellent !
B005QB3KLE|5|Great no problems
B0040E9DGE|1|This was not as big as it looks in the ad and I just did not care for it. I used it anyhow.
B0031I209W|5|Great cover for the price very easy to handle it comes with a travel bag you can easily fold and take with you great cover great price
B00VAVVTLW|5|I bought this for a 2005 Hyundai Santa Fe.  I really like the package deal.  Didn't have to do any spring compressing which is a plus.  I also liked having new springs as well as the new struts.  And the rear shocks were just an added bonus.  Thanks Amazon.
B000NSATSM|5|Genuine OEM replacement part. Includes a new incadescent bulb.
B003YMSDJQ|5|I recently replaced the battery on my BMW F650GS Dakar with this battery.  The best part is that it won't spill acid if I dump my bike.  It's very handy to have the second set of terminals for other add-on wiring you may need.  I wired up my GPS to the additional terminals.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />After 4 years, the battery capacity has fallen off sharply and the battery will not start the motorcycle if left sitting over a week.  But that is not the problem.  I think 4 years is plenty fine for a battery of this nature.  The problem is that I ordered a replacement battery that arrived with a manufacture date of 11/14.  It is currently 9/15.  That's 10 months old.  The Motobatt website states;<br /><br />Due to the self discharge characteristics of this type of battery, it is imperative that they be charged within 6 months of storage, otherwise permanent loss of capacity might occur due to sulfation.<br /><br />I started a return claim and was notified that a battery is not returnable due to the hazard of shipping a battery.  Now, how could they ship it to me, but claim I can't ship it back??<br />So I called Amazon.  I explained the situation.  The Amazon rep offered me a full refund or to ship another battery.  I was told I could keep this battery and dispose of it as I wished.  Well, ALRIGHT!  Thank you AMAZON.  Now that's customer service.<br /><br />I recommend that you verify the date code that is branded into the top plate of the battery if you order one, to confirm it's a fresh battery.
B008EF2GA0|2|The lid leaks!
B0069Z0320|4|Excellent products and quality. Looks good in the car. Recommend to everyone. Plus it's my favorite college team. Carpet is really thick.
B00B6YQ6HU|5|The price is so much cheaper than the Ford Dealer. The o-rings fit perfectly in the fuel bowl drain valve.  Just remember to put some oil or diesel on the rings before installation.
B004X1H6O0|5|Love it just as described & super fast shipping thanks😀
B000BQY82E|5|This is a great product.  I have two of these on my car (one on the car's oil pan and one on the manual transmission), and on my motorcycle.  I bought this one for a new motorcycle.  I also use this product on any vehicle I service, including my girlfriend's car and my mother's minivan.  It makes changing the oil much easier.
B0015D4ZNY|1|Worked as expected only question is why they didnt issue a relay with the winch in the first place. Im no engineer but you dont send that kind of amperage to a switch.
B000ENOPPO|5|Easy to use and it really does seal the flat tire.
B001U8QS9I|3|Although the covers look exactly like the product image and fit the vehicle, the envisioned means by which the manufacturer suggests they be attached to the back seat are not readily available to the consumer. The seat and seat back would need to be removed.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this means that the covers come off constantly. They CANNOT be jimmied, so if you were hoping to jimmy them, please reconsider. The seat and seat back have to be removed to properly install this cover system. It is attached by looped elastic using s hooks to connect them beneath the removed seat and seat back.<br /><br />They are beautiful, but without the proper installation become a major problem. The material is quality and durable, even after the seatbelt access holes are cut in the back seat fabric. Please Note: There is no access flap for center-seat cup holders or trunk doors.<br /><br />The front seat covers are perfect for bucket seats, can be used without having to cut access holes for seat belts and secure very easily (with the same securement system of elastic loops and s hooks) under the seat. Be prepared to tuck any excess material into the seat, which is supported by another set of loops.<br /><br />I would recommend this set to anyone who is prepared to have them properly installed.
B007ZLMAIM|5|Reasonably priced. Perfect fit & fast shipping.
B00I5D91LS|5|Fits great and keeps the dust out
B00AC6SAZE|5|A microphone that's right at the lips, and noise-cancelling for cellular use.
B00IO8IO6W|5|Fit  and looks great.
B004PBA4RO|4|Finally got it done. Do not attempt to put this seat cover on if you are in a bad mood. Allow at least an hour to get it just right. Figuring out what section to unzip, sticking your hands under the seat to connect the clips to each other, and reaching between the seat back and bottom takes time. Guys, you might want to ask your wife or girlfriend to help because getting your hands under and between the seats requires small hands. I ended up with a bleeding finger after squeezing my hands in, and as a female, I have small hands. I think it was finally worth it in the end. Good for the price. I have a Toyota Rav4.
B00RBFBLUU|5|Fit E46 M3 side vent perfectly..... Shipping is a little slow as it comes from China.... Seriously China. Update 1 year later. Plastic has a film over it that you can scrape off but looks dirty. For the price still good.
B00CI8QEPW|5|Nice quality, fast shipping
B00DS4K66S|5|I absolutely live this shirt. It's fits great. I'm very happy with this purchase.
B001GMX9KE|5|The Curt trailer hitch went on, yes, \\"without a hitch!\\"  Works well and looks great.  I feel confident using the best made hitch on my car.
B00DLMN2P4|1|Not working,  ill return
B004323RPG|3|This is kind of flimsy and seems like it will break if left on in the sun. It also does not have a spring on the connecting end either. When looking at the picture I thought there was one in the black area.
B004BTAJ2A|5|It fit perfect !
B0006V95TA|5|I just painted my calipers color is amazing looks like they were bought from a factory like that my brother and friends bought there's at a auto parts store and I still paid less then them even with shipping I highly recommend this to anyone
B0089XOHYU|5|This item does exactly as it says it will. I used it on a leather jacket, a satchel, and also some work boots and have plenty left over. This is a fantastic product to have on hand if you own any leather products.
B000C6ZDYK|5|My brakes are now perfect!  These are especially high quality rotors and fully resolved a bit of wheel wobble during heavy braking.
B00GXJIWRA|5|Great replacement fairing parts kit.
B000N8K874|5|Best Harness on the market.
B00PT18QAQ|5|very well made
B0067EZIJ6|5|I've had much, much better rides since I installed this on my Honda Shadow (2007).  I'm also less fatigued after I'm done with my riding.  **Don't forget to check the screws every once in a while like the manual states.**
B004MYFAF0|5|Very good belt
B007BZH4LK|4|Purchased this item in Titanium and it matches my Gold Wing color almost perfectly. The helmet design suits the cycle's styling and is comfortable wearing.
B0066RKVL4|4|The stealer ..er.. dealer wanted $110 for the OEM part.  When I told the parts clerk that I could get it for $30 from Amazon he said the best he could do was $79.  I found this cup holder to be about same quality as the BMW factory cup holder.  And unfortunately that's not so great. To rate it 5 stars (\\"love it\\") it would have to be better.  It was easy to get in, but the hard part was getting the old one out.  I had to break it to get it out after removing the two screws, but fortunately I didn't do any damage to the slot and was able to slide the new one in and replace the screws.
B0001CKHY6|1|Very disappointed with this item. It's tattering and tearing in less than a year!. I live in So Calif, so there's no snow here...The material used in this cover is horrible! Apparently the fabric has no UV protection, so it appears that it sun rots very rapidly. I would not purchase this brand again, nor would I recommend it.
B006X152SU|5|Although I have not used this bag yet I believe it's going to work out great.  It's larger than I thought it was going to be so I should be able to pack a lot of stuff in it.  I'm giving it the highest rating because I believe it's going to work out great.
B00H7JDWV6|3|This is a good conditioner but did not remove ink from leather. Did not even lighten it up any that is why I am only giving this a three star.
B00192JGN0|5|These are holding up well. There are other covers that are more expensive but I found the quality and fit to be good on these. I don't expect that they will last as long as some of the more expensive ones but they seem very good for the price.
B002HJ557A|5|Excellent horn. Works great, installs easily. (Harley Ultra Electra Glide)
B000CRDLZM|5|Works as advertised.
B0006307WW|5|Perfect fit
B001U27N84|4|if the battery can lost a longer after a day full charge would be better. it stops work after 3am
B00EZE9HL0|5|Took a few days extra to get it cause it ships from China,  but its was in perfect condition and plugged right in to my existing harness. 5 stars!
B004960DQC|5|Product was exactly as shown and very easy to install, I looked up installation on You Tube . The price was also great. Thanks
B00I74I300|5|Good price
B008TECLSI|5|It's simple to use & it works on my 1964 vespa.  My wheels have hubcaps so the regular break locks or wheel locks don't work.  The width of the clamps are adjustable & it locks my vespa in place.
B001O2T43M|5|It is a nice set of tools.  It was very useful and it arrived in very good condition.  Good buy.
B00BHTGX8G|1|I can't believe I waited as long as I did to receive it.  Sorry that I ever purchased this item.  Not expensive but not even worth the postage to return, I'll add it to my trash.  Thought is was nice for what I needed but would have liked Fahrenheit rather than Celsius
B000QFDCQI|5|Great look
B001447VB2|5|Sometimes in life you luck out, and you discover a product that just performs so well it leaves you positively glowing! I'm really taking a shine to this product, it's just so helpful. The effort in perfecting this product really exposes its polish and the manufacturer's attention to finish and presentation.
B00KTIYXLU|5|nice product very happy
B001XCBDU0|5|I was skeptical about buying this but it has actually worked a lot better than I had anticipated.  You do need the sticky dash mat to go between this and your dashboard to keep it in one place.  It is worth more than its price...
B000CAXUU0|5|Part was new in the box and a great price, not much else to say. Works better than the old clogged one did.
B003SHA4BM|5|Husband wears it every chance he gets.
B004FVA2EE|5|Been looking for one of these for a while, so glad I found one. The unit came just as described and was here very fast. Looking forward to getting it installed and safely treating my batteries.
B00480GYF8|5|ok
B006TMOU4A|5|Great product!
B0029UM2KK|5|Bought a Chargers decal from Matson Deals as well and loved it. As said in my other review, I Have had decals in the past that did not live up to my expectations. I set the bar pretty high in terms of decals and this one went above and beyond that. Loved the look and crispness of the Eagle's logo. Would highly recommend and would do business with Matson Deals again.
B000CIONQW|3|This works well as a cheap rear view mirror in my office cubicle.  The adhesive seems strong and it was easy to attach to the top of a computer screen.<br /><br />The mirror surface was scuffed and scratched.  The imperfections are not severe enough to reduce functionality, but they're still annoying when my eye catches them.
B0016IKXL6|5|I had already done my troubleshooting and the module fixed the problem. The unit I purchased from Amazon appeared to be an updated version.
B003BZINVO|4|Works Well, no complaints.
B00LAJP186|5|Good
B0040CW2A0|5|Used these to replace the clips which hold up the engine splash guard on the front of my 2001 Honda Civic EX Coupe. They popped right in - no tools required.
B0000UZ528|3|The visor is good and made well considering the price so overall I like it and will keep it but measure carefully.  I have a small compact car and the visor is one width on the left side and bigger on the right side.  The visor fits on the left but not on the right.  I had to come up with a velcro solution so it will fit.  It's too bad the velcro tabs aren't longer.
B00HJXTV5G|5|Just what I needed happy camper here
B000KKLLFS|5|This product was exactly as described. These are plastic so they work great for steel or aluminum valve stems because they will not sieze.
B005BNXN4Q|1|Regulator failed after 3 weeks of use. Fuel pressure dropped below minimum specification, pinging on acceleration and fuel trim maxed out rich. Using a factory Toyota part immediately solved the problem.
B000GZEK00|5|The replacement sensor solved my fuel injector cut off problem and improved gas mileage by 2-3 mpg.  Replacement was easy and straight forward.
B0010Z4MDK|5|Good product which meets my requirements and expectations.  I bought this one because it offers a higher amp-hour rating (5AHr) vs 4AHr that most of the others are.  I did have to trim the spade terminals just a little in order to fit the standard sized connectors on my alarm system control panel.
B00G931CFO|1|Purchased last December for a second set of Winter wheels, but couldn't install in the wheels until this past September. The wheels sat in a garage for 3 months with the new OBE-011 Sensors installed.  Just installed the wheels on the vehicle, and after several hours, they still will not register. They are supposed to be a direct replacement for the OE sensor according to the ORO-TEK website, and the vehicle does NOT require a separate reset procedure, just install and the vehicle is supposed to read the new sensors (4 wheel, independent readouts). So they must be defective. Probably  DEAD BATTERIES.
B00N5AYCX8|5|Recieved these yesterday and they worked and fit perfectly. Installation was easy if you have the right tools it takes about an hour. Very pleased with shipping time.
B00II6ONQU|5|Looks much more expensive than the price paid! Recommended by a friend, who had a set on his streetglide, I installed them on my 06 Electra glide, had to open up the ends with a tool loaned from the auto parts store, other than that it was an easy install.  The looks and sound is fantastic!!  Put a grin on my face, like I said: you can't beat the price!
B00B5ZYY38|5|Worked perfectly for my 2014 evo
B0002T8GK0|5|Dri Wash 'N Guard gives a beautiful shine to the car. It's easy to use and performs as it is advertised.
B006BAM5RE|3|I never could get the remote to work with my vehicle.  So, I replaced the casing on my old remote with this one!  Works just fine now.  The guys were very helpful to the point of being willing to &#34;walk me through&#34; the programming process.  I didn't opt to take this route because my schedule would not permit me being on the phone for any extended period of time.  Plus, I'm not really a &#34;phone&#34; person.  Sorry.  I'm sure if I had taken this route, I would not have had any trouble programming this remote.  Great price at any rate!!!
B003332LDK|5|Great rock and bug protector. Fits perfect on my 2004  Spider GT.  Car has been in the Florida sun for months no sign of wear or fade
B00BSVUXRU|5|Fitted perfectly my Tiguan 2013
B002XL2IBS|5|Great job in cleaning hot water heater
B00029WYEY|5|Good stuff if you are using a K&N air filter on any automotive or motorcycle engine. Works very good and is easy to apply. Just follow the instructions.<br /><br />DS
B00A69992A|3|Wouldn't snap into my car.  i am going to try gluing it.
B00O2XJ0PW|5|The leather keychain is simply great. I totally loved it when I saw it. The packaging was so good, a cloth cover for the key chain was great. Easily attaches the keys, no mess.<br />Small and lightweight, but large enough to carry essentials keys and what you need day to day.<br />This was a gift for my husband who'd lost the other leather keychain I gave him 2 years ago. He's delighted to have another with a different color.<br /><br />PROS<br />Easy To Use<br />Functional<br />Good Quality<br /><br />CONS<br />None At This Point<br /><br />PS: I received this for a promo price for my honest feedback.
B00CF72ON2|5|No issues so far, very easy install and they look great and brake hard. I will update this review if I experience any issues.
B000FW4LT4|5|Wasn't sure about this, with the brass blade and all. It works flawlessly with even the most stubborn ice. It was only a couple of dollars! I've broken ones that cost three-four times as much. Simple is better. Thanks for a great product.
B007MUY76O|5|The struts arrive on time and were in good condition.  Installation was quick and the new struts lifted the back window very well.
B00CJUI0WO|1|Do not recomend
B008MQ7S40|5|Definitely better than paying $250 to Harley. Good quality, no chrome chipping as of yet (2000+ miles since I installed). Makes a world of difference with highway pegs to extend your legs out and relax when you're not changing gears. Fit was very close but I ended up having to give the top mount a few smacks with a rubber mallet to angel it properly. I noticed a good amount of vibration going over 75ish, I solved this by cutting a 4&#34; x 1&#34; piece of an old tire and putting holes in it to mount between the lower mount and the frame. Could probably benefit from a piece between the top mount too. Surprisingly good product, comes with two bolts for the bottom and you reuse the ones already holding your horn and rubber engine mount. LOCTITE IS A MUST!!!
B000XTHUHE|1|Although these wipers do work very good as I do have this product on the front of my auto, there are certain makes of cars that you can only get the rear wiper from the dealer. My Toyota 2003 Rav4 is one of those that for the rear 14' wiper blade is a dealer item only. I have heard the same for Subaru and I'm sure there are others. After ordering this and finding out it won't work, what do you do, do you return it? It cost to ship it both ways, which costs more than the original part in the end! so most people just eat the cost and then are stuck with a wiper blade that they can not use! So buyer beware, even if the search that Amazon has and which I used for the properly fitting blade says it fits on the rear of your auto, question it!
B004VIA1AG|5|great product at a great price!<br />fast shipping!<br />I would suggest buying a size or two larger than what you normally wear.
B000BQYH8Y|1|Small...not worth the price.
B002YCAHQY|4|I bought this balancer for my 1987-1993 5.0L Mustang. After my purchase was made I found that the Dorman product is also made under the Professional Products line. My only gripes, when it comes to this balancer is:<br /><br />1. Although it states that the balancer is a direct replacement I found that some people using the Professional Products line did not get the correct spacer (which was included with my Dorman order). I was in a panic thinking that I may have to wait another week to get the correct spacer. In the end the spacer was included.<br /><br />2. Installation was a breeze. Just pop the old balancer off with the correct puller tool and install the new balancer. During research of the Dorman/Professional Product Balancer I ran across some information specific to the 1987-1993 buyers. You will need to take the 4 bolts that mount the crank pulley to the balancer and find the same thread pattern grade 8 or higher bolt in 1.5\\" length. I believe the factory length is 3/4\\"-1\\". This information was not included in the package or description.<br /><br />3. Since this balancer covers a variety of Ford engines (any V8 engines with a 50oz counterweight) there are 3 timing patterns on the balancer. Since I was replacing my OE style balancer, because I believed the timing ring had slipped due to its age causing a false timing reading, I did not have a good reference point for TDC. It took me a few tries but I got the timing down perfectly.<br /><br />Other than the few minor issues listed here the product is priced well for what it is. My package did arrive a little beaten up like someone just threw the balancer inside a box that was just too small. Never the less there was no damage or parts missing. I would recommend this product to anyone AFTER they research what needs to be done or acquired before hand.
B001KN8HO2|5|Purchased as a gift.  He loved it.
B005CCJ3E0|5|They are whiter than the headlights on my Rubicon, and great for distance and side highlighting.  They come with a fused harness and a switch, everything I needed to install it for use.  I did switch out their round switch, which seemed perfectly fine, for a rectangular rocker for my switch panel.  But there was no reason other than aesthetics, that I couldn't have just cut a matching hole for this.  (As it was, I ran with it as-is for several weeks, with the cable chicken-banded to my steering column to &#34;try it out&#34;).
B00757H1K8|5|good
B002MAXFCQ|5|The car cover went on easy and protect the car great. I like the bag that was included for the cover great touch
B005EJGSQ2|2|I bought this because it takes forever for my car to heat up, and my commute is relatively short. It worked so well for the first couple of weeks. I was warm and happy. Then, out of the, it quit working. My husband is a mechanic, and he took a look at it, and he said that it was just dead. What a shame. It had great potential.
B00AURR2P4|2|This product does not fit my 2002 Ford Explorer XLT. The part was rubbing up against the frame of my truck that could have caused all kinds of havoc.
B004GCDU32|5|exactly as stated  Had it installed in under 30 minutes and it fit perfectly  cheap and good replacement when youu tear yours off on thiose parking lot blocks
B006R0IECI|5|Just what we needed. The item description needs to state the length of the extender however.
B0047DGUKU|5|WAS THE RIGHT ONE !!!!!!
B001PWFPE8|5|Was not sure how this would work at this price. I installed in 20 degree weather and it took about 30min. It works great. No more banging tail gate.... A great improvemt at a great price......Verry happy customer......
B0008DBU0S|5|I have had about 1 year without the UV Coat and my liner faded to the point that I could see the orignal color of the paint in the bed in some areas. I really don't put much in the truck bed, but need something to keep out any rust. I live in the desert where it gets over 110 degrees in the summer. I used this top coat and for about 3 months it has not faded at all. I was concerned about the seller due to some complaints, but I got my order fairly fast and it worked without any BS. I would purchase from this seller again. Love my truck bed. Looks great again.
B000NJHFWE|4|Works well enough. If I were to resize it I would make it about 1/4 shorter just to get it in and out of the window faster but it is pretty much exactly sized  and reasonably easy to store the way it is.
B0002JM9NU|5|goes with the brush...
B007AOSA06|5|The molded floor mats are an exact fit. Driver's side snaps into place. Great for keeping mud and water out of the carpet.
B005ASSUGS|5|Documentation is clear, install was easy, and appears to have clear up my high HP ignition issues.
B00QFY2BCK|3|I wish I could give this a better review because it's a great concept. The wipes were sent in an envelope, which would be fine BUT the wipes were not in a sealed envelope resulting in a very wet delivery as the cleaner completely saturated everything but the headlights.  The wipes simply didn't have enough liquid to work...all for the absence of a sandwich baggie.
B0059HJKQ4|5|works as should
B0007LZGLA|5|Worked great!
B00IGJKFXE|1|Not at all horrible ... Nothing like it shows in the picture
B0002U2V1O|5|works great on 4 ft  shuffleboard, 4ft bowling alley, AWESOME for nok hockey
B005FUW152|5|All bulbs work great!
B002K6K3RM|4|After having them on my 330i for over a month now, so far everything still looks great. We'll see how long these would last before they burn out....
B000ZLS6AA|4|I will take some responsibility for this product not working you have to drill holes and I don't have a drill bit over 10 inches.  It did kill two out of three but the largest tree it didn't kill.
B007RY076E|4|This stuff worked out really nice for how cheep it was thought it was gray and black but just black. Turned out nice on my 91 superjet stuck really nice with contact cement on the hau. Didn't need any for the hydroturf because of the 3M it had on the back. I'd buy it again
B00BG8XUIO|3|The part looks ok, but the stripe to attach it doesn't look secure so we are afraid that in time it will come off
B00CTN6ZB4|5|This thing is badass and great quality
B006G3YNB2|5|good price
B004ZF49AI|5|Fit perfectly and worm amazingly!
B000CMH7JS|5|It is bigger and stronger than the cheaper one. Hope it stands the test when the next idiot run into the back of my truck
B001O5QNWE|5|order the starter after my shock with the price difference. receive it very quick , install  the starter and start  the unit. work great
B00L4TF32G|5|Great
B00GVIY970|5|High quality vinyl sticker with strong adhesive. Easy to apply and looks great. Sharp detail. Nice price for a nice product.
B00CAX5Y6A|5|These work great. I can replace the passenger pegs now with ease.
B00F40Q5UA|5|It took about 10 min to install, including removing covers. It's good know what the engine is up to!
B004WQ44MI|1|Need to change the picture  thought I was getting what I see which was a white side mirror now I have two different  kinds
B0063N4F7W|5|Different color than factory but this banjo bolt works. Seals well with correct copper washers. I don't know why the title says &#34;Brake Hose&#34; as the part is the banjo bolt pictured
B00230J506|4|Fairly simple to install and was glad to see it was assembled, other than the blade mechanism.  Only problem I had was the locking lever to adjust the blade side to side doesn't work smoothly.  It works but is definitely the weaker part of the design.  I am happy with it and would buy again.
B0081N1OS0|5|I need glasses for reading and these give me the perfect match of dashboard visibility and road accommodation. You can tilt your head up slightly to magnify distant road signs. Nice.
B002P8IHDC|3|SUPER EASY install on my 03 Suburban. There is NO vibration at all- even better than the stock one that was on it. My only issue is that the mirror falls forward facing downward after shutting the door or hitting a bump. You can move it back up from the door controls, it's just a nuisance.
B0034ZUZM6|5|Winch was delivered fast! Love Amazon prime :). But on the winch it came with everything described, and the fairlead included is an exact match to the rusted one on our 07 can am outlander, it is a tight fit in there and we had to buy a different mounting bracket than what was included but who cares as it was a great price! Store bought winches don't come with a bracket anyways so we are still saving $$. Crossing my fingers that all goes well with the rest of the install... wiring it'll be a pain but fun i'm sure lol. Just crossing my fingers on finding that &#34;perfect&#34; spot for the solenoid and having enough wire. Will hopefully be updating tonight or in a few days on how it goes.
B00JF4D7K2|1|Im sure i orded a silver one, but thought the smoked looked ok
B007HEWNC0|1|DO NOT purchase this tonneau cover! For that matter, DO NOT purchase any tonneau cover that is shipped by Trends-Auto. The cover I purchased should have been a Tri-Fold cover that utilizes EZ Clamps nearer the tailgate... a simple enough system for keeping my truck bed out of the weather. What Trends-Auto sent me was what they termed, &#34;an upgrade,&#34; which does not utilize the EZ Clamps but instead has the SmartLatch system. Now, this SmartLatch system in theory is a great idea but severely flawed for my 2007 New Body Chevrolet Silverado 6.5' bed. When I unboxed the tonneau cover and overcame my initial shock and dissapointment at finding metal accessory brackets, I gave it a shot, for TWO days. the metal brackets are a fantastic nightmare and what's worse is the manufacturer knew it and supplied pathetic plastic strips that they call shims. I never got the brackets to hold properly as well as keep a decent seal between the cover and the truck. So on the 3rd day I visited ACE hardware and purchased 4 C clamps (hoping to just make due and avoid a return nightmare). The C clamps were better than the hardware supplied in the box, however, I was still unable to get a seal.<br />So I finally gave up and decided to contact the seller. After telling 3 different people the same thing over three continuous days, &#34;not the cover I ordered, I want an exchange or refund,&#34; I was finally told that I have to wait for the warehouse to &#34;approve my return&#34;. And of course no money back until they get their product, which was not what I ordered in the first place. I am placing this information against both items in hope that my pain is not shared by others.
B00AQ2D4C8|3|Good rack and very easy to install. As others have mentioned, this rack is quick to rust. I noticed some developing after its first use during which we encountered some rain. My main reason for deducting 2 stars is the bolts. I am installing this on a 2006 Jeep Grand Cherokee and when fully tightened, the bolts extend up into the cargo area. My intent was to keep a spare tire stored there and I end up wasting storage space because I have to center the tire between the bolts. Even so, with a little shifting, the tire ends up resting on top of one of the bolts....which is not good. This could be resolved if Pro-Series sold varied size spacers. As it stands, the only way to resolve the issue would be to cut off a 1/2 or so of each of the 8 bolts.
B004Q3KE12|5|Arrived Quickly.  Lovely and colorful.  The perfect touch.  Not overly girly.  Combined this with a swirly butterfly decal on the back window of my small truck and it all came together.
B005FKXRIC|5|Love these brakes.  Couldn't beat the price.  Put them on when I did both front wheel hubs.  Old brakes still good but happy with the upgrade.  No noise and stop better.
B008BYPA8E|5|I purchased this compensator because of all the negative remarks made on the stock HD compensators on the newer TC-96, 103, and 110's primaries. I am still in the process of building the bike but I wanted to solve the problem of a noisy primary before I finished the bike, so I dont have a review of the comp in service. I did create a video of my installation of the BDL compensator on youtube. My biggest question was if I had to remove the spring pack from the face of the alternator rotor. You DO NOT have to remove that spring pack which helps in installation. Here is the video:<br /><br />[...]
B003NBFMMY|5|Purchased this product for a trip to Orlando, Fl.  The recent storm Beryl dropped tons of rain on us.  I had the bag packed with 5 carry on rolling suitcases.  It held up on both directions of the trip which was over 1500 miles.  Everything stayed dry.
B000BQRTKM|5|Works as designed. Strong and built and engineered perfectly. Super easy installation and great instructions. I would recommend this bracket.
B0000AY4YJ|5|We have used this product for many years and find it to be superior to other products on the market. we use it on our boat, hot tub cover and our convertible top.
B000GKU0D6|5|Coupler came as advertised.  Very easy to use, highly recommend this product, especially if you own farm supply or atv equipment, pumps grease in any position.
B00A6VDPRS|5|Very satisfied, thank you.....
B000JFRHZ2|3|I have a 2009 Kawi KLR.<br /><br />This is an okay cover for my needs. It's not great.<br /><br />It doesn't really fit my bike, even though the Dowco rep said it would. It covers the bike fully. But the vent hangs at an odd angle on the down side of the parked handlebars with a large tented peak on the raised side of the handlebars. So it's not venting as well as it should.<br /><br />There are also ZERO grommets of any kind on this cover. ZERO, NONE, NADA, ZIP. They straight up lie about that.<br /><br />The cover is waterproof. And the soft bits match my windshield. It has the heat shield in the right place.<br /><br />Water pools in the elastic band around the bottom whenever it rains.<br /><br />In short, if you ride a KLR, this is NOT the cover for you, unless you are getting a fat discount.
B00SG82OOI|5|Looks great on wndow.
B001A6KR6A|5|Very good item, a bit pricy, This is only the body only  so be advised you have to get the core kit.
B003H6R9G2|5|After much research I ended up with the Borla competition exhaust. When I told the installer which exhaust I purchased he smiled and said that will work just fine. The fit was right on and the sound is amazing. The look is so much better with the factory exhaust removed. The one thing I was worried about is that it might be to loud, but I can tell you that's not a problem. Even with the top down. Order and Enjoy!
B00NFEH7PY|5|good
B00B1SZMNA|1|small flawed and made in China
B000UKGUXQ|5|The product arrived on time and it was as described. It worked pefectly and there were no problems with it.
B00924ODX0|5|Easy to replace but requires 2 or more people. Instructions were very easy to follow
B004ZF31PC|5|perfect
B00PXMDC0A|1|Nice quality steering wheel satisfied with the product. Rated this one star because I had to order this item twice because the woodgrain is damaged when I received it. Also packaged poorly. Don't want to bother returning it again I wouldn't buy this item again.
B009DK0SGY|5|Very good product.  Highly recommended.
B0030ICO3U|5|Really helps me back into my garage without hitting the back. Love it.
B002NUABUO|1|Clear only, no rust inhibiter in the can. Spoke with sender and he said it was too late to return.<br />Len
B004E4IBMW|5|I have a 1988 Isuzu Trooper on which the original tank has deteriorated and sprung a leak.  The recovery tanks are no longer available from the dealer and I did not want to chance a junk yard. This tank (with a little mounting bracket adapter fits nicely into the place where the original was.  It holds only slightly less than the original tank.
B000NB874C|5|Saw this product on a Classic Car show and loved what it did for the cars it was applied to!  Works great!!!
B004W4OAYC|4|We bought these to replace the same lights which one started to get lots of condensation inside and then caused the builds to go out repeatedly. Well the new ones began to do the same thing now so we're back in the same boat
B00877SL2M|5|Nice blueish color and bright if they do not work just do a 180 with them will buy again for other projects
B00P4KTLRE|1|Not dark like in the picture. There is a faint tint to them but you have to look real close to even tell. I was kinda mad when I opened the boxes
B001G61QP0|4|STOP like a mofo, lots o dust
B00BZQQTP8|5|I'm so happy I order the item I have used it so much already.
B0044AVLF0|5|its genuine period
B001EY8Z44|5|excellent quality Colours are so crisp and bright. Couldn't be any happier with quality and price. Arrived very quickly
B003HFSUOS|5|Perfect for what I needed it for. Love how white the color is and easy to handle for knots. Great quality.
B001IH8PXI|5|This is the second set I have i like that one key fits all
B00C7XYST2|5|Perfect fit, thanks.
B0012TRGS2|5|I wasn't expecting this item to look as good as it does, seems to be very well made and looks great on my motorcycle.
B004IVGA0G|3|The only reason I bought it is because I didn't find it anywhere else.<br />The product is fair but I don't like how short is the thumbscrew, it should be longer for smaller flagpoles
B00498ZR0M|5|Moog is my go to brand for suspension and steering parts. If you are doing this type of work, do yourself a favor and use Moog Parts. Far superior to factory springs, these weigh much more because they use more steel, but the ride is firm and steady right out of the box.
B004BWBSMW|3|I bought these to quiet my muffler down and they did just that.  This baffle is not a straight through baffle.  The only issue I had was the baffle was too long to fit in the muffler and line up with the bolt hole in the muffler.  The baffles would not go in far enough.  They were about 1&#34; too long.  The indentations inside the baffle were keeping the baffle from going in any father.  I corrected this issue by drilling a new mounting hold about a inch out from the original mounting hole.  The muffler end caps still fit on without any problems and now the muffler is much quieter than the straight through original baffle.
B002YKGETA|1|THIS ITEM HAVE NO INSTRUCTION MANUAL I WAS EXPECTING THIS ITEM WITH MANUAL
B004OHJ33K|5|Purchased for a 2011 Explorer XLT with second row bench. Cheaper and 90% the quality of WeatherTech and for me, the deciding factor was the driver's dead pedal. The Husky liner covers it completely whereas the WeatherTech digital fit liners only partially cover it. The point of these mats are to not have to lift them to clean. Mine came with some edges slightly rolled and they have since flattened out. I'm very happy with these and expect them to hold up many years with two kids. I also have a Husky cargo liner (over 3rd row seats) that I'm very happy with.
B000CIPHUI|5|Great unit.  Was skeptical at first, but it does the job it was designed to do.  No more uncovering cars every 2 weeks and start them up.  Just plug them all into the Battery Tender, and  let them rest in peace for the winter.
B008B5X5GC|4|good product easy to install and works great
B004HE3WAU|4|These are not OEM ceramic pads, however they are aftermarket ceramic pads that work well on older vehicles. I would not install them on a newer vehicle with low mileage. I installed them on the rear of a 2002 grand am. they fit and work well. Time will tell the durability of the pads.
B00LBAA8MS|5|Amazon product! The life of the charge is fantastic. It charged my phone (Note 3) my girlfriends iPhone 4s and still had alot of juice left. For the size it packs a huge punch.<br /><br />Let it's battery charge fully and you are all set for a long weekend. This thing is amazing and is well worth every cent.
B0006H8OO6|5|Speedy shipping and perform as advertised
B000RN4GFA|4|I hooked it up and it works good.  I think the picture could be a little better, but good overall.
B0036GAWQC|2|Well all I can say is that it didn't fit the way it should have .... So I had to make it fit... Plus when I ordered it. their,picture showed chromed ... Not basic black, and the black is what I got...Well I 'll know better next time to make sure that my parts are what. THEY ,.. said that they are...
B00MQ5Z5F2|5|Very powerful and well thought out. Has every connection you could ever need and puts out enough juice to turn over my high compression seadoo 4tec. Fired up my jet ski like 15 times while trying to get it working and only lost one bar of power. I take this thing everywhere.
B004YW4L1O|5|Nice glasses.  I have to get used to the big focal , but great have, especially at work.  Awesome!!!
B00LU0UBH6|5|Have you ever washed your car only to come out the next day and it looks all dusty? This duster works really well. We've also got a drought happening and it will help towards conserving water.
B00480N16S|1|Based on the product description and some other reviews I was expecting much brighter lights. They were not brighter at all than the standard bulbs so I returned them. I'm still looking for bulbs that are brighter than regular halogen bulbs.
B00029JOE2|5|OOHJHH MAN I LOVE IT..THIS IS A GENUINE GM PLATE AND ITS CHROME..I PUT IT ON MY GIRL NOW SHE LOOKS STUNTIN N SHINY... I LOVE IT
B00B2NVFAS|1|Great product but just go to lows. it is $6
B000COBBSY|3|It worked, but replace the drain gasket before you install. I had a bit of a leak until I replaced it (by guessing and buying a bunch of O-rings at the hardware store) make sure you buy a ring that is resistant to oil.<br /><br />Other than that, it works like it should.
B009S9RWI2|3|Fun sticker to motivate a boy to be more precise.  The &#34;s&#34; letter only lasted a couple of flushes. So our sticker reads - bull  eye.
B002UB5SG8|4|The cover was very hard to get on! Other than that I like it.<br />if you are an Elvis fan, it's perfect for your car.
B001JT98S6|5|I had been looking for a cigarette lighter plug-wire that could be used in a workshop to connect my 400W inverter to a 12V battery solar power system but I have never found anything that had a beefy enough wire for me to feel comfortable with using. This one was great having the 15A wire....like other reviews, I simplu cut off the connector and was able to quickly attach it to my inverter.
B000E8OTW8|5|Good!! excellent items, its perfect and work excellent this is best good and I think buy more again thank you!!!
B000EVU8J8|5|Use it regularly when tuning my Triumph TR6 antique sports car. Especially helpful is the RPM readout so I can set idle speeds much more accurately than the car's tachometer.
B003UZ28CU|4|This product is worth the money paid for it. It however could be made of better mesh steel. That said, I would buy it again.
B004668JH0|1|I had such high hopes for this, and it was a total disappointment. Workmanship was good, but the sizing was totally useless.<br /><br />Measure from the tip of your chin to the base of your nose (where your nose meets your upper lip). If this distance is 2\\" or greater, then this face mask WILL NOT fit.<br /><br />The pocket for the nose was ideally situated for my upper lip. The tip of my nose barely fit within the mask, and everytime I would yawn to clear my ears (I was riding in the Himalayas, with a lot of dust and frequent 7,000 ft elevation changes) then my nose would pop completely out of the mask.<br /><br />If this were to be size for adults, then I would highly recommend this mask. Unless you have a short face, don't even bother, and it helps if you have a neck size < 15\\"
B000N3W8J0|5|As my title says, it does the job. Keeps the dirt trapped at the bottom instead of floating back onto my wash mit.
B00H9S71LW|5|If this thing only works one time, it is worth the entire price. I have a 97 Ford E350 v-10 van. Old enough to not have a fancy computer to tell me mpg and such stuff. But, now I have it.    But, the strong point is the diagnostics offered by this little device. The diagnostic function will pay for the whole cost if/when I need to figure out why my van quit running.    I just love this thing.    I have used this thing now on two extended trips.  It performed flawlessly.  At 70mph I get 14.5mpg.  At 50 mpg I get 19mpg.  Hope the diagnostic part never has to be used, but I know it will someday.    Really happy with this thing.
B0074NJN8Q|3|the pan doesn't really stay sealed to the floor.<br />But for the money, can't really go wrong.  blah blah blah
B0075JYPNM|2|It comes in two separate stickers, it's a pain :(
B00029WSZO|3|These are nice little mirrors but the mounting stud and bolt are not stainless steel.
B00HMGQWP2|5|these eagles are for my side windows on my equinox. as it is still winter in Minnesota the eagles are not yet on my car. I hope they will last as long as I own the car. I guess time will tell
B00JH27K82|5|Exactly as the picture
B00B7HBKPY|5|These fit perfectly on my 2001 330i (E46). They were very easy to install. Just make sure to order 2.
B003ULWDZG|5|good
B008F91ME6|5|These lights beat the old 12 volt version by a mile. I have mine set up for easy removal when not in use, by using 1/2&#34;  PVC bolted to the bow and stern .
B000P0XMKK|5|Fit perfectly on my 2001 Buick regal.  Pulled the harmonic balencer off just like it should.
B00QW8PRXE|5|Solves the problem of finding the other end of the seat belt.  They place the belt connection down beside the seat and a console.  I had my shoulder replaced and cannot function that well or with a great strength at that location.  This extension brings ease to an impossible situation.  The only negative is that the webbing could be a bit stiffer.  Being a bit more rigid would prevent folding when you attempt to engage the connection.
B000EVYGZA|5|Just what the battery ordered. Seems to have precise readings
B00853NUMO|5|Fits perfectly, appears to be a good quality.
B007VXTRLW|5|Great product and service!
B00498MLYM|5|Easy to install and matched up great. Like new again. Looks like the original and works great. Will buy again
B0006MQJ02|4|We gave this to my daughter who is facing her first winter in the Reno NV area.<br />She says she is very happy with all the practical items that AAA put in it. I<br />would recommend one of these in every vehicle regardless of what weather you face.<br />With the first aid kit, strobe, and shovel alone, you'll be better prepared that<br />most drivers to lend a hand, mark your position or dig out.
B00KTIJ6TY|5|Received remotes on time.  Worked great.
B001GH1PU0|5|The first switch I put in blinded me when I turned it on. This switch has a larger surface area and the light when on is just right.
B002ITTGEC|5|The horn arrived in a few days and was in perfect condition - very easy to install.  Directions say to use 9/16\\" socket/wrench on nut for mounting bolt, mine was 1/2\\".  No big deal.  I did have to slightly drill out the hole on the bracket to get it to slip on the mounting bolt - too much paint.  Again, no big deal.  It truly is plug-and-play.  Not sure where others on here talked about running a wire to the battery, etc.  Also no issue with vibration as other poster complained about.  This horn is MUCH louder than the lousy OEM horn.  I highly recommend it.
B004HELSU6|5|Great Product, Great Price and Fast Shipping. It fit perfect on my Razr 900 and helped cut out some of the cold wind on our last trip to Alto
B00FJ67SF0|5|Put these 6000s in my fog lights for my f250. I had previously put Kensun hids in my projector headlights. It took me no time at all to install. All in all I am very satisfied with these fog lights. Extremely bright and worth every penny
B003NI6CK8|5|I ordered these hood struts for my 05 r/t dodge magnum about 3 months ago and I can honestly say that this is an amazing product! What a difference it made. I went to my local auto part store and they wanted to charge me 85.00 to purchase replacements. So I went on amazon and found these for 39.00. I figured that they were cheap enough to take a risk on.  They arrived two days later and I was pleasantly surprised on the quality of the product! They were easy to install and took no longer than 5 mins! I will def. be back for all my strut needs!
B00BTHNEDI|5|Really bright.
B00KL3ALGO|4|These cling shades are so easy to attach (or remove) and help reduce the dazzle and damage of the east or west sun whilst I'm driving.  A very useful product.
B00603DSGO|5|Fits great and seems very heavy duty.  Holds the antenna.
B00CS86EES|5|Great way to upgrade those old halogen bulbs was an easy swap over. I am using them on my fisher snow plow and they are amazing .
B001KNYUAM|5|I used it on my Hyundai Accent 2009 perfect fit month later breaks work just fine.
B002ESEMXC|1|Did not fit. Threw them away.
B002XL2IEA|5|Works
B000C9DTF2|1|This was the wrong size for my 2008 Ford Escape XLT 3.0L... I wouldn't recommend this size for anyone matching my vehicles description.
B00E9FS28E|5|It was easy to install - just screw it in!<br />Of course if your old one was broken off you will need a &#34;grab it&#34; to get the broken screw out...
B001ECPX0U|5|I bought a set of these Strut Assemblies for a 2002 Ford Focus ZX3 which had a broken spring.  Installation was relatively easy after watching a good YouTube video on the steps. The vehicle now rides like new again, albeit a little like a Buick at first.  The springs have since settled down after a week of driving and now feel like \\"normal\\". The price on pair of these struts saved me over $40 from where I could get them locally, and hundreds of dollars on installation on what a shop would charge.
B00C32PPCQ|5|Extremely fast shipping, beautiful color, and great quality. I recommended buying these to anyone that wants to add a special look to there ride
B00KTHQR0Q|5|Great product and easy online programming instructions.  Worked perfectly for my 2005 Dodge Ram.
B003DL6WS2|5|Good product
B000CMH4XC|5|great quality, easy fit.
B000X9EGFS|5|I love this compressor. It was a little bigger than I expected, but it is great quality and works well. I spent months deciding which compressor to get, and I finally decided to go with this one.  It may not be the fastest compressor on the market, but the 100% duty cycle was the biggest selling point for me. The second selling point was the longevity of the compressor. I am in a Jeep club, and this is a favorite among the members. Many of them have had it for years and it is still running strong.<br /><br />I use this almost exclusively for offroading. I air my Jeep tires down to 12-15 psi. It takes about 10-12 minutes to air all 4 tires back up to 30 psi (that includes checking the pressure, going between tires, etc.). I have 31 x 10.50 tires. As I said above, it isn't a FAST compressor, but it isn't slow either.<br /><br />A benefit that I wasn't expecting was the noise level. It isn't as loud as the cheap-o 120 V compressor I used in the past that was slower than this one. I feel like my engine in the Jeep runs louder than the compressor.<br /><br />I was also pleasantly surprised by the accuracy of the built-in pressure gauge. Mine is within 1 psi of my other gauges. You do have to release the trigger and stop airing up the tires to check the pressure. It cannot accurately measure the pressure while airing up. Luckily, I noticed that the pressure gauge is about 3-5 psi higher while I'm actively airing up the tire than the actual tire pressure, which means I can air up until about 5 psi higher than my target and I'm usually really close. It makes me wonder if the other reviews mentioning that their gauge was off by 5 psi was because they were reading it while airing the tire up.<br /><br />The carrying case is nice, but a hard case would have been more appreciated. That isn't a big deal because I'm not rating the case.<br /><br />I feel that overall this was a great purchase!
B005GXLAEQ|1|Wasn't what I thought at all ,thin as beer can way over priced.
B004QBNA8I|4|not sure as to whether a comment is needed;<br />self explanatory ... 'cept this handle is cheaply produced;<br />by the Ford Mo. co.<br />an exact replacement for half the price quoted ...<br />as an employee eligible discounted item<br /><br />shipped as expected
B00ISFER1M|5|Looks<br />Great!!!
B005WGR22Q|4|This lets me check out more of the issues on my 2000 Jetta. Love it. Wish you could tinker with more things with it but hey, at this price, can't complain.
B001DRPA0E|5|I purchased this filter to replace the one in my mercedes..it was an exact match and the quality was similar to a mercedes oem
B0049MV1EY|1|they have multiple adaptors for multiple power cells....i got a sk-bt20 the adaptors do NOT FIT...i had to fill down part of the metal for them to fit....not a huge deal to but....cant give it a good rating based on that....after that they worked just fine though
B00B1CLV36|5|These seat covers are totally awesome seat covers - exactly what I needed.  purchased them for my new 2014 Toyota Highlander with leather / air conditioned seats.  I didn't want to sit on them if I was dirty / wet. etc/  These slip on and off in seconds and are really rugged.  Love them.
B000CP87JE|5|Kinda cheap looking Thanks
B00BME0PIU|5|I bought this for my 2015 Challenger. Fits perfect, super easy to install. I'm the type who knows how to do nothing on cars and this was a piece of cake to install. It's great quality, heavy duty compared to the OEM door. Makes my car look even better than it already did.
B004BYX8W8|3|I had to cut off part of the plastic shaft that controls the open door chime when the key is in the ignition - minor - but annoying when you have to install it twice!!! - get what you pay for
B000JFJMFK|5|Does what it's supposed to!
B004P5CM0C|5|met and exceeded my expectations! the pics of it here didnt do it justice!<br />Will be watching this sellers items from now on!
B003ZW8NMW|5|Great
B003TTDBWI|5|Very good price and it fit just like it's supposed to.  Seems to be holding up just fine after about three months on the car, if it doesn't last very long I'll update this post.
B002M4E0VC|5|Helped me determine that the shaft seal on my water pump was leaking in addition to the leaks at the gasket. Glows very brightly and for quite some time.  Following the instructions on the package I added the whole bottle to my truck, if I did it a second time I would start with 1/4 bottle and maybe go as much as half.  When I removed my water pump the small amount of coolant that spilled on the driveway made a huge glow in the dark mess that took quite a bit of water to wash off.
B000JFL8S4|5|Just received have not used yet, looks sturdy.
B004R662GY|5|Love love love this!!!!
B000ANOUHQ|5|Great product does what it says it does 100% happy with it would buy from seller again highly recommend this product keeps me  warm in the winter !
B009RTRVP2|5|Noticeably brighter than stock bulbs.  Very nice!
B000E24APU|1|Did not work well on the leather seat in my car. It was difficult to mix the proper color. Also did not adhere and fill properly. Do not recommend the product for this type of application. One star.
B0002RNS28|5|I bought this as a gift for a friend and she loved it!  The red color looks great with her gray car.
B000S34PBY|5|I have vent visors on both my vehicals I bought local. I found these on Amazon At a great price! They were a gift for my mother and she loves them!
B005Q24U58|1|Bad quality<br />Rebuilt the engine, put these in bike ran great. A week later it started sucking in oil through the crankshaft seals
B008LMWL38|5|Good
B005JDT0GS|4|Great
B008PINOMU|5|Fit perfectly no mods need drive feels smooth other review said didnt fit but i had no problems with install
B009IFIGP4|4|Perfect size and fits nicely and goes on very easy.
B00CO6PWA6|1|Did not fit my 2009 Mini Cooper base model.  Description said that it would fit. Bushing otherwise appears to be of good quality.
B000EVWEKO|5|Nice install.Not hard to hook up at all because my Auto Mechanic did the Gauge job,for me. Alright,I was Lazy and tired.So he did the job instead. It did come out perfect. I would buy this Gauge kit again, for my other car.And yes,I would use the same mechanic. He would charge me less for doing the install,since he now has the knowhow.  Thank You Very Much!!  [wolfman]
B00K9BF848|4|The bumper sticker was fine except it was not the one I ordered.
B002NOGKHS|4|Fit perfectly from my Blue Ox base plate to my Reese ow bar.
B00BFEBW98|5|works great. would use it on all my motors, put it in my trans, shifts smoother than ever has. Best thing out there.
B00TA5ECJQ|5|I purchased this product to transfer the gas from my snowblower to my lawnmower. My decision to purchase was based on the 5 star reviews. It worked exactly as described. Very easy to use. I completed the transfer of gas within a couple of minutes. Great price for a quality product. I recommend the GasTapper. You will not be disappointed.
B00185FK1K|5|I installed the radio speakers and antenna on my Kawasaki 610 XC Mule and i love it, easy to install and it sounds great.
B00Q74T766|5|Worked perfectly...
B0009PCPNQ|5|Excelent for my car
B000EQ985S|1|Does not fit on the 2009 Toyota Camry as it implies. Way too big! I am very disappointed in the waste of money.
B00A2OJ55U|4|on time and good shape, does what it is intended for.
B00H9S71LW|2|Learned after purchasing from Amazon that this unit will NOT work with ANY Apple devices, no matter the IOS version.<br /><br />I'm told it has to do with the bluetooth radio not being certified somehow, but the end result is that none of my Apple devices can see this over bluetooth.  I borrowed an Android phone to see if it was an issue with the device, and I can confirm that it DOES work with that, so the issue is not a bad unit.<br /><br />To be fair, the description of the device only mentions Android when it comes to their software, but I had no reason to suspect that an IOS based app would not work with it either; however, since no IOS device will pair with this unit over Bluetooth, no IOS software will work with it.  I'm left with a device I cannot use without purchasing an Android-based device.<br /><br />Update 12-Feb-2014:  The actual product box has a starred disclaimer saying \\"ODBLink LX works with dozens of 3rd party apps (including Torque and DashCommand) on virtually every platform* and across every device category = smartphones, tablets, laptop and desktop PCs\\" *=except IOS, which is supported only by the OBDLinkMC WiFi.  If that language was on the product description on Amazon, I'd have known that it wasn't going to work with my iPhone.  Since it isn't shown anywhere in the product description, I had no reason to suspect it was completely incompatible with IOS.
B000FIXQXK|5|awesome
B00684TAYY|5|No reason to give it less than five stars. Very happy with it. Feels like good quality. Arrived quickly in my mailbox.  Came with instructions as to how to program it. Followed instructions and had no problems. All buttons work well.  I have an AutoMate remote with kill engine and remote start and was still working after programming this new remote. Very happy with it.
B004SFKJIQ|4|We live in an old house with one bathroom.  Invariably when the one is in use, some one is pounding on  the door in some sort of frantice &#34;I Got To Go&#34; announcement.  This port a john fits the bill for the small stuff.  Not so good for the heavy stuff, but it works.
B00JBIBGSM|3|One light was messed up
B003CMIH2Q|5|good
B0021WBAE0|1|wrong size
B00U2ADLW2|5|Great  Quality with the easy learning curve !
B00M9WL6WI|5|very good
B007WR25GG|5|Worked great on my cross country trip
B009KM1N6Y|5|love it! easy to apply and looks great on my car, ive gotten four compliments already and it brings a smile to my face each time i walk to my car
B001ELZIAG|5|Looks very good and works well. Fits well also and price was great
B0064RD6PY|5|great purchase and fair price,i use this everyday and this is my second pair from same seller(dont want to run out since i use them everyday) very comfortable and light, very well made, I am a mechanic and have to wear my knee brace everyday and this undersleeve  is great , keeps me cool and, would totally recommend this item and seller for their great service, thank you<br />J Ramirez
B000DZM7FS|4|Simply works and works very well.<br /><br />Will take out most slight scratches easily and without much effort, but they will not erase heavy and deep scratches. They are not designed nor formulated for that purpose.<br /><br />Those are for sandpapers.<br /><br />Better than most polishing and/or buffeting compound.<br /><br />The 1000 Gram can is much more economical than the small tube, but only so if you have a lot of polishing to do.
B0049MTGQY|1|no center support to attach to vehicle.  after using it on longer trips the center attach point distorted downward. replaced the hitch for one with the center support, where the hitch bolts, 3rd point of attachment
B003S8IOI6|5|I needed a new key for a 2008 Taurus.  The dealership wanted $35 for just a plain transponder key, or $130 for a key with built in FOB.  I purchased this key for $10, a keychain FOB for $5, and paid my local hardware store to grind the key ($3).  It was simple to program both the key and the FOB in about 3 minutes.  I paid $13 for the same key that cost $35 from Ford, and for $18 I got the same functionality of the $130 key from Ford.
B00FQT3U1Q|1|These wipes were very dry, did not work at all.
B00975YM9E|5|These work ok you can tell the smell is there it is not overwhelming but you can smell it. It is kind of fun to see peoples faces when they smell it and start looking around for the smell. Arrived on time and in good condition.
B000CGM9O2|5|worked well.
B00F4MQJ5O|5|for around $100 I can not believe how bright this thing is!! I get asked on the daily where I got it and if I can turn it on for people. This has the looks of the $1,000 bar for a 1/10th of the price. I bought some mounts for it and a wiring harness and install took less than 2 hours. It has lasted through rain snow and high wind. Just FYI when they are roof mounted it does vibrate at 70+ MPH. nature of the beast no mount will fix that
B0037RZS9G|5|Everything came as expected, comes with headers, gaskets, and spark plug sleeves to reflect heat.  Make sure you run your plug wires accordingly as headers do get hot and #4 cylinder plug needs protected well.  Overall you can't beat the value for a set of headers.  This was a good buy, I am not a huge fan of headers but I cracked a manifold and thought I'd give these a try.
B0013HYAV4|5|One of the whitest and brightest aftermarket bulbs I have seen yet. The closest color to my HID beams. Priced really fair. Highly recommend for headlamp upgrade.
B005QDTVR4|1|These are well made BUT do not fit your body molding correctly. They only cover about 95% of the side molding (They are too short). They look completely like add ons. They are also not bent to the correct angle of the factory molding.  Due to the wrong bend angle there were dents all over each one from when I pressed them on by hand. I had to take them off because they were covered in small bends due to me applying them by hand. It was a total waste of money. Even if there were no dents from the application, they look very cheap once installed. They looked like I had made them in my garage.
B006X6NA8Y|5|Easy to attach to the grille and it looks great! Fantastic quality. My husband insisted on buying this for my 2001 xterra and i was skeptical,  but he was right! Very satisfied.
B000276B18|5|perfect filter for do-it-yourselfers.  No surprises here, just a good filter at a decent price.  What can I say, it's a Fram!
B009ET23RG|5|I loved this tool, every man should have one, you can also place the multi pliers at your Jeep's roll bar
B0034ZUZM6|5|WOW this winch is just the right speed and very well made. Thank you seller.
B000BZEH3A|5|Great sensor that fit the 2000 cavalier I was working in. Light went out immediately.
B00PEC1DTQ|3|Good enough, but the problem that i can't plug the key into the car cuz it's covered. But, it's ok i can start the car with start/stop button
B000P17NXQ|4|I bought the P3 brake controller due to its features, quality, and reputation.  I have not been disappointed.  In my case, my original unit failed; but, the process of dealing with their tech support was the best I have ever experienced.  If the unit itself does not sell you, their tech support should!!
B000KYXI3M|5|dose everything easy to program
B0006MRQXG|2|No problems with the product other than it is a single.  I thought I was ordering a pair--who orders a single wheel chock?
B000CIGGW6|4|I got my order and the plate is just stunning.  It has an all mirrored polish and raised emblem and Caddillac name.  The weight is very solid and will not bend or warp.  It comes with 4 snap on chrome like screw caps to keep the entire ensemble looking lovely and sleek.<br /><br />Looking for an elegant, stand out, substantial plate then here it is and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Cheers and Vidimo Se!
B001587248|5|I give these nokya yellow bulbs five star!<br />I wanted to keep the stock bulb watt and did not want hid's so I purchased these nokya bulbs and expected them to be ok and when I reserved them and installed them I was amazed on how great they look and the yellow really shows really bright and I sure do not regret getting these bulbs.<br />I would recommend these nokya yellow bulbs no doubt.
B0053OSBUY|5|Looks exactly like the one Gates has in their YouTube how-to video. Well worth the price as it makes the job a lot more easier.
B005FZYR1S|5|Loved loved loved these pants! I'm 6'3\\" and snowsport attire tends to run on small side...not these! Perfect length! Spent winter in -10º to 15 F temps and stayed warm and dry. Would recommend to everyone!
B000V99HFO|5|Bought the key ring as a gift for my father in law who just purchased a new X3.  The key ring arrived quickly (Amazon Prime).  The key ring is is pretty and heavy.
B000CSS9WQ|5|The product worked great, I didn't have any problems with it. It was delivered on time and was able to test the product, I recommended to any one needing the Ignition module.
B007SWPNI2|5|this was a gift for my grand daughter.  she was very happy with it.  i didn't think they made them anymore.
B00DYDSG6K|5|I bought two of these to mount on each of the rear windows of my car and they applied easily and look awesome.
B00J5SYNAQ|1|I brought 3 coils two weeks again. An 2 of the coils were no good. I had to replace them.
B000BYGE1E|5|Perfect fit on my 1995 Toyota Previa.
B006M4AOCC|4|Fit pretty good in our new 2013 Corolla.  Look as if they could have come with the car when purchased.
B008NCBC0Y|5|worth every penny.
B00L844VUM|4|They fitted my car very well and work excellent.
B00NRLCJPI|5|It's so beautiful on my gril,thanks
B00VAVQ4I0|5|Arrived earlier then expected.  Was an exact fit.  Even did the job myself.
B009WD6K5A|5|Adds Great look to Bike. Had it professionally installed.  Not the easiest product to install. Nice and bright.  Real head turner.
B00ML7DIJA|5|Excellent fit in my 2005 F150. Definitely longer than the incandescent bulbs that came out, so make sure your application has additional depth  for the new bulb.  Pictures are hard to capture brightness, but these are significantly brighter than typical 3057 bulbs.  Helps me see in reverse through my moderate(30%VLT) window tint.  I'm impressed!  I also recommend the interior dome and map light LEDs.
B004O40M7O|4|very fast delivery, looked great and easy to install- could not ask for any better.
B000C9BXDC|5|As described, fit perfect
B005V0F522|5|I bought this battery to replace the dead battery in my APC UPS. It fit into the UPS perfectly and has been totally problem free in the month since I installed it. Excellent price.
B000HAB81I|1|did not work. a little expensive for a product that says it stops leaks in all the places fo the system but didnt
B00AS4K6QQ|5|Love his work! Great service and great guy!
B004I0N62C|5|Came quick. Worked. Period.
B00B4XBQPU|5|Perfect fit. Just ordered a second.
B00389R8KU|5|So far so good. These line tapping connectors are the best I've ever used so far, and one of the great things is this: if I make a mistake I can un-screw it and go at it again without wasting a connector. I like that. So far; so good. I've not used them a lot yet, nor for an extended period of time, but in a few months I'll have a better, more educated, opinion.
B007IV6AYE|3|Works as described. I would suggest buying a replacement strut heavier than the one your replacing. Although I purchase a set that has the same rating as the ones replaced, the bed still does not remain lifted.
B000JZY5ZW|5|Our 2002 Liberty trunk glass lid no longer worked on it's own. I bought this for my fiance as a stocking stuffer basically for Christmas. I thought it would come with both sides (I think the title has been updated since I purchased this) so I only ordered 1. Well, it only came with one and I thought I screwed up and would have to order another.<br /><br />He installed just the one, and it actually works perfectly. Many people said in the reviews that it was too hard to close the glass after installing these. Maybe just install 1? It's worked for us. There is still a lot of resistance too, so I can only imagine how strong 2 of them would be! I'm not sure how quickly it will wear out, but it's been going for almost 4 months now and feels just like it did when he first installed it.
B008YS3V88|3|Works as advertised and a good price.
B008ITZ6F4|5|Perfect
B00I96JZU8|5|So far so good. Used 3 times in my lawn tractor. I take it out & put it on a battery tender when not in use, so it is getting spoiled so far. Love that it is maintenance free, no acid & water to mess with.
B000FFY8VC|5|This is simple, effective, and inexpensive.  It's just what I needed.  I use it when I need to put my EzPass in a rental car.  I've had no problems with the suction cups to date.
B00IQE6YKW|5|worked as advetised
B00695Q3P6|5|This purchased as a gift he used for a 80s honda he said it could be a little more snug but it works. He uses it for his netbook which is not it's intended purpose but it does the job not bad for the price.
B001DCEWOE|5|I'm very happy with this yes I Love It<br />I hate reviews but the product is great so I'm pleased
B0056RP9RQ|1|ordered this pump as a direct replacement for the bad pump in the harbor freight parts washer.  When received the outside of box said it was suitable for solvent but when I opened the box,  it was the same fountain pump that harbor freight says is NOT suitable for solvent.  After 2 days in mineral spirits,  no pump.<br /><br />SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY SOMETHING ELSE&#62;
B00N3OOQUK|5|Very good multitool, although it is sad that the little one does not have a knife. However, maybe it can be taken on an airplane this way.
B0050SFZBG|5|Major headache saver. Must have and especially for the price.
B0054KSFI0|1|It looks like I'm not the only one wirh out the keys, I bought this because I need it for the weekend of 4th of july now I can't use it NO KEYS. And they won't expedite the keys. They want to send it via standard so I will get it when I come back from my trip. What go it that to me.
B001GH5PX8|5|this switch looks great in my jeep wrangler.
B00A82FZFK|5|I was a little worried about the reviews on this product, and this would be my first LED underglow kit. All of my other kits were neon and very bright. I was NOT disappointed with this kit. I have a 2013 Scion tC and I had enough lights to go around the car, as well as place two sets in the grill, with another set left over. (the two, one foot sections). The control box, and the remote are FANTASTIC. When I walk away from the car I can easily start or stop the lights, and control the patterns, it does only have a range of about 10 feet, but it's more than enough for my purposes. I will say that I installed this kit on my wifes' car as well and when using the remote it is on the same frequency. So be aware of that if you use multiple kits you may need to manually use the control box if you would like it to show different patterns at the same time.<br />The concern about the water getting into the seals is still a worry for me, but I don't want to test it on purpose, so I'm waiting til rainy season here to see what happens. I did read that if any of the lights go out due to something like this then they will replace it for you with no problem, but I cannot attest to this.<br />Bottom line, if you are on the fence about this item get it. I would pick this anyday over neons again. They are just as bright, and the ability to &#34;flex&#34; them and &#34;mold&#34; them essentially is priceless. The patterns are fantastic and adds something else that other people don't have when they use standard neon bulbs.<br />For those people who are concerned about the wire length there was plenty for me, although i was not running these on a truck or SUV. I did make an extra long wire for one of my interior series with solder and they work perfect. Any questions just ask, and if this review helped please let me know.
B007VR9K2E|5|Worked great !!
B0058WY7BS|5|So far so good. The vapor canister vent valve is working like it suposed to. Great. Very Satisfied. A +
B004ZBD69M|1|They don't get much cheaper. Thin, loose, stretch cord broke easily while installing. Slide all over the seat. Get what you pay for. Not many options out there unfortunately.
B00527FMPE|5|Bought an AGM TMS battery for my motorcycle last year, left it in the bike all winter long, (in Ohio), battery was still fully charged this week when I started it to get it ready for spring. So i purchased the same brand of AGM battery for my new quad, ready to go out of the box. Put it in and started the quad. no charging or filling required! Very good product. Don't let the low price turn you away, It's worth it!
B000JZYWUK|5|Good
B0057VWU1E|5|Was pretty skeptical but gave it a try.<br />It works really well, both on the car as well as the windows.<br />I'll be buying this again
B0071Q8IHI|5|Good quality for price. So far so good for 1k miles. I ain't dead yet so I'm assuming they work really well.
B00BZR3O46|5|Perfect fit for my 2014 F150 FX4.  The color match for the HID lights is much better than stock.
B000C5FDY6|5|Quality pads. 02 F150 stops much better than whatever was on it. I've only had the truck for 8000 miles so I don't know what the old ones were, but I now have more confidense in my trucks stopping ability. Also, this set had much better hardware than the ones I've used in the past.  Definitely recommend and would buy again.
B001SLEM7W|5|I ordered these seat covers for my car, hoping that they wouldn't look bad or fit bad, but for the price, i was willing to take the risk.<br />I received them and installed them (the correct way) by taking the seats out of my car and taking all the extras off that didn't need to be covered. To my surprise, they fit very well, I have 2012 Nissan Versa Manual Hatchback.  Unfortunately the seller doesn't have the same for a 60/40 bench seat or i would definitely buy those.<br />Here is the before and after (after is on left of course)<br />[...]<br />Here are two more pictures of the after<br />[...]<br />[...]<br /><br />The only things i do not like about these are the fact that they have a very large opening for the headrest([...]) and the fact that they don't seem that they are very durable, although after about a month of use i have not noticed any wear.<br />The head rest issue can be fixed though, it just takes a few minutes with a needle and thread, or a better idea would simply be to turn it inside out before installing it and just sew it shut.> ([...])
B004OYALPC|4|good price
B000KID31K|5|Purchased this when I purchased a 1999 mustang, now I keep this in the car for a 2004 Honda CRV.<br /><br />This is a must have to start learning about what a car/truck needs to run effectively. Save time planning by knowing what the car needs, instead of being clueless at the mechanic.<br /><br />If you want to unlock the power of your car knowledge, then this is a good first step!
B00BSK7Z86|5|have two friends ordering this product will order more for my self the strong magnet with padded covers prevents damage
B000CITK8S|5|While I do think it is overpriced. I have gone through several cheaper off brand small chargers for motorcycles and mowers and such. This one seems to be better than the others I have used. Now to see if it will last more a couple years. I guess if it lasts a long time,it will be worth the price.
B00OZUKPNS|5|They look great
B00B1VBQRS|4|tried and true
B00L2T4AX6|3|Good
B0024ECCJW|5|Haven't used it yet, but installed it. The process was as described. It looks like an awesome product I will enjoy for years
B000F3507A|5|This is one product that is a BIG surprise on how great and easy to use. A GOOD cleaning is needed to use on the dash  , but when finished it all sticks well.(test first).The color of gray looked rich and the thickness was not over done. Thanks .
B000C55MQK|5|excellent buy and they are working fine
B00AZZ66FS|5|THIS CARB WORKS GREAT, HAVE HAD NO ISSUES AT ALL, WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE LOOKING TO REBUILD THERE CARB, THIS CARB IS SO CHEAPLY PRICED BUT OF GREAT QUALITY
B00D42AFS8|5|I bought the PowerAll PBJS12000R Rosso Red/Black Portable Powerpack in case of emergency because this thing will jump a car about 15 times and it has so much power for computers if you loose power along with a bright light built in and much more.<br /><br />I got this for family members and you charge the thing and put it in your car and hope you never need it but I think most of us have either needed a jump for our cars or where someone else may have needed a jump plus this does so much more.<br /><br />A must have for those emergencies !
B000BYGGQ2|5|Changed out my plugs and put on these cables on my 98 Mustang. Pretty simple. The black boot one kept popping off though, I honestly have no idea why one boot is different, I just routed it to a different plug and worked it on till it stuck.
B000PLT70I|5|works as expected
B000W3RU9Y|5|Strong and always reliable and they always come in handy
B0016LG0CY|3|Bought (2) and got one DOA.  The product was so cheaply made, I hope the remaining unit would last a bit longer.
B000COBLJI|3|The 100w/55w bulb is exactly as described, but the photograph depicts two bulbs in a package.  I only received one in a factory packaged box.
B0013TM0Z0|5|love it. pleased with it. use it in razor atv and it keeps us warm in the winter. love it
B00873J0YY|5|These roof racks are wonderful. A little difficult to put together at first, but well worth it. Only complaint is they should come with more heavy duty straps. Have used them numerous times since purchase and very happy so far!
B000DLBIGG|2|I've got a 2011 Mazda3 Sport that has such a wimpy horn, each time I hit the horn button, I can't help but imagine Peewee Herman whining, \\"excuse me?\\" Mazda should be ashamed of the sissy, apologetic beeper that the Mazda3 comes with, but then again, the Japanese are famous for producing great cars and motorcycles ALL with wimpy horns. My 2010 Kawasaki had a pair of horns that were almost as bad as what the Mazda came with and I replaced them with Hella \\"Supertones\\" ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030YWM0Y/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i00 ), which are LOUD. I was going to get the Hellas for the Mazda, but the Fiamms had generally good reviews and they're cheaper. The good news is that the Mazda3 puts out a positive feed to the stock horn, with a 15 amp fuse, so I didn't need the (supplied) relay. That made installation and wiring very simple. The bad news is that one of the two Fiamm horns is EXACTLY the same horn that Mazda used as OEM equipment! ALL of the information on the horn, right down to \\"FIAMM\\" and the series of numbers embossed in the plastic (A046495 AM80S-E3 55306 0055306)are the same. The only difference between the OEM horn and one of the new ones is that the new pair came with red plastic covers on one side of the bodies and chromed grills added to the trumpet outlets. The red covers and chromed grills were probably added to make them a bit more spiffy for those who would install them on a motorcycle, since they're marketed for car AND bike use. So now my car has Hi & LO tones of Peewee Herman horns. They are not especially loud, but just having two horns in place of the OEM single unit still nets an increase in total sound, if not by a lot. I gave them two stars because they do actually go \\"BEEP\\" in two tones and, even if they're not very loud, they're a bit better than what MY car came with.<br />The Fiamm horns are inexpensive, but I suppose it all boils down to, \\"you get what you pay for\\". Next time I'll spend a few bucks more and get the Hellas.I suggest you do the same.
B0015GRUPG|5|TY
B0073QTY74|4|Havent had the opportunity to use yet, but I got it quick and upon inspection, seems to be quality built.
B00W9306JQ|3|I got the lemon scent. It did not have a strong lemon scent like I hoped but a more softer scent.  It seemed more like a lemon vanilla scent.  It did last a while even when in a car parked in the hot sun.  I would recommend this product as long as you were not looking for a strong citrus scent.  I received this product at a discount for my honest review.
B0124DKVXG|3|Quality is just ok. Magnets do stick to car. Even left it by mistake while driving through the carwash and they were still there afterwards. Biggest issue was one magnet had bubbles under the logo. It does appear one of the corner of the logo is separating from the magnet.
B005JU5W54|5|I got a pair of wiper blades from Costco. They were made by Good Year so I figured they had to be good but for some reason on my prius they didn't work very well but these work great!
B0028SCLJU|5|This is maybe the best wax I've used!!!  I try a lot of different products but this wax really was easy to apply and remove.  It gave depth to my shine on my car, as well as the rims!!! Yes, I used it on them also.  Can't wait to use the rest of the line of products
B000CFSFR8|5|I've had this intake installed for about month now I've seen an increase in 1-3 MPG. Of course this is dependant on how I drive. Easy install only took 30 minutes and a couple beers. I recommend this product.
B000CPCOAM|3|I purchased speed bleeders for the front and rear of my car.  The rear set works fine (they're a different part number - 639570), but the fronts (639560) leak after being seated and tightened to OE torque spec.  Additionally, one was not properly functioning, as the valve inside would not close and therefore the bleeder would suck in air after being bled and seated.  They're useful if you have to bleed your brakes alone, but you might be better off spending the money on a vacuum bleeder to do it yourself with.  They are also much longer than OEM bleeders in my case, so they almost contact my wheel barrels (and I have larger diameter wheels than stock).<br />TL;DR - They're alright, but some units don't work.  They also might touch your wheels if your OEM bleeders are shorter than these speed bleeders.  Buy a vacuum bleeder with the money you'd spend on a front and rear set of these.
B001QUCUGK|5|Work perfect.
B001CQWM8E|5|perfect and solid
B006IRE9T2|1|burned out with in amonth
B000CSGWZM|5|Work great
B00G6188EM|5|I love these Reflective Tapes I got from Taylor. It comes in a nice easy to install strips, just need to make sure the RIM is free of dirt. I used some rubbing alcohol to clean the rims and slapped them on. It has been about 8 week, and these babies are sticking like crazy...took me about 15 mins to get all 4 sides done. Love it !!!!
B004CPUM84|5|In reading the other comments and ratings I was skeptical that a helmet purchased at such a great price could be quality.  I am now SOLD on this helmet.  The shipping was ultra-fast and the helmet fits like a dream... I've not liked many full face helmets before now as they press my cheeks up, which feels to closed in and uncomfortable.  This helmet is well designed - It cradles the face and cheeks without excessive pressure.  The front lifts with ease and latches solid. Vents open and close with ease and overall this helmet looks BADASS!  It's a great deal, GET YOURS TODAY!.
B006969RQM|5|These caps are very nice. Adds a nice detail to your car or whatever you put these on. Little overpriced though.
B007LIBWU6|5|sharp
B000C5WCUE|5|Three drop down menus and one click tells me this does not fit my car.   That cost them a sale, but saved me from buying something that   would not work. TYVM, you have my respect
B00HIKT7XQ|5|Quick shipping, quality parts
B00IMQ4XDE|5|Excellent ce pose très facilement et donne un beau look au véhicule
B0020GY29C|5|Like always Amazon is the greatest web-store around. The cover is great, the only issue is Fit I have a Harley Davidson 48 and the XL is way too big for it.  If you have the same bike get the L.
B004JAZPNE|5|Received this gas tank skid plate in about 4 days from order.  Amazing!  I put it on my 95 YJ.  It fit up perfectly with the stock holes.  No drilling required.  It took a little &#34;manuevering&#34; to get it up into place but that was expected due to the exhaust piping run.  I used stainless steel hardware to mount it back up as the original fastners were partially corroded and gone.  This item comes exactly as it is shown in the picture.  black powder coating.  No hardware or fasteners included.  I also ordered SPECTRA PREMIUM ST212 FUEL TANK STRAPS to go with it.  They were a perfect match.
B005N723QY|3|The T shirt was a basic, cheap shirt. The print on the shirt did not look as good as on the picture advertised. It still works for me. I wouldn't order it again but it's here now and for the money okay.
B00HQZNOQO|5|great quality and fit!
B000COO2QM|5|good quality as expected from melling. used on my GM 5.3L LS
B0064RF1SY|5|Better than expected, great fit, even over glasses.
B000CPINHA|4|decent gauge... great value
B0006IX7WY|4|Works well.  I have used it in a camper trailer cabinet so the contents doesn't come out to meet me when I reach the site.  The tension is adjustable and after a couple trips, it does what I needed.
B000JKPTPM|4|I wish it had longer screws .... because the short ones almost didn't reach ...... but good thing I had some spare screws for it........
B00FY84VTO|2|This thing is PLASTIC? A PLASTIC BLEEDER NUT AS WELL? RIDICULOUS HOW CHEAPLY MADE no wonder they CRACK. Im not buying it personally but its for my 25 yr old niece who bought this car which needed repairs but this part is overpriced everywhere else. its ridiculous.. this shouldne be more than $15... OVERPRICED PLASTIC...but forced to buy under her financial circumstances. im stuck doing it free labor.. whats family for...
B000B8JUAW|4|Doing its job sometimes hard to open
B000GKTYNI|5|Confirmed: silicate, borate, nitrite, phosphate free. Good for Honda/Acura, Toyota/Lexus, and probably most/all other Japanese cars. Can't say for domestics.
B00V3N9U9U|5|Looks great just like the pic. Very happy with it.
B000M1GMQS|2|While the product looks and feels heavy duty, it just looks odd the way it sticks out.  I have a really large and tricked out truck.  Even for my truck the cross is too large.  I mistakenly ordered this hitch cover twice over the last several years.  Both times I was disappointed with the look and returned it.
B001EP28XW|5|Exactly what I was looking for.
B004UVEGPK|2|I purchased these eyelashes thinking they were the fanciest thing.  I like danty stuff and just knew these would draw attention.  Well it did just that.  They were very easy to apply and curl. However when you're driving at a medium to high speed they whip your car and therefore damage your paint (although later I was able to clear my surface back to new with some car scratch remover), also as you drive the lashes will break off one at a time.  So they are not that durable and in no time you have bald spots and must remove them. So I like them but they are of no quality in my opinion at this point.
B009DJSNPI|4|These performed fine in my car.  This is the second car I've installed Evan Fisher coil into and both have ran great.  Only have about 10k miles so far on the first set so i can't comment yet about their life span.
B00404WDUC|5|My husband initially gave me a hard time for spending this much money on a tire pressure gauge but when we used it for the first time today, he (and I) both were delighted with it. It was so much easier to attach it to the valve on our motorcycle and scooter, we liked how easy it was to see the current pressure without disengaging the tool. We liked how easy it was to let air out until desired pressure was achieved... again without disengaging the tool. Awesome! I'm happy I bought it!
B001DH0QKI|5|Couldn't believe I was paying $20+ to replace my filter on my Hyundai Elamites 2010 ... So incredibly easy to install and fit perfectly.
B000JZFMOA|4|I just installed this half-shaft in my 2002 WRX sedan 5MT and I want to share some immediate observations. I will update my review (and possibly the score) after I've had the part in use for a while.<br /><br />The first and obvious observation is that the CV joint housings are of significantly larger diameter than the originals. That may not be a problem, although, it is fairly certain that their moment of inertia would be higher than the stock part, which would cause a small imbalance. What it does affect, for example, is the clearance for installing the lower turbo heat shield, so if you are, say, in the middle of an exhaust installation (like after replacing the clutch), you better hold off on reconnecting the half-shaft to the transmission until you've installed the heat shield.<br /><br />But probably the most important observation, and the one for which I hurried in posting this review, is one structural detail that might affect the longevity of the half-shaft and possibly the operation of the ABS (Anti-lock Brake System). The problem is that the Empi half-shaft does not have a baffle plate at the outer CV-joint, the one that would isolate the hub from the elements. You can actually see the ABS tone ring, fully exposed, with the half-shaft in place. This means that road dirt and, in the salt-belt states, corrosive slurry, will be able to freely enter the hub and could ultimately adversely affect the ABS operation and/or cause the CV-joint housing to seize in the hub, making it impossible to remove it in the future, giving for a very expensive repair upon, say, a simple CV-joint boot tear.<br /><br />I did not have the option to try and move the original baffle plate to the new half-shaft (if it would fit, at all) because mine was seized in the  hub (after 140,000 miles in the Midwest and another 15,000 miles elsewhere), but Empi shouldn't make their customers have to do that. I have had experience with other aftermarket half-shafts for Subaru and missing baffle-plates has regularly been a problem. I don't know what it is about supplying a $1 part that would make a great difference in longevity, but it seems to be rather common.<br /><br />So far I don't feel any problems (about 100 miles) and my current state does not use salt in the winter, plus I drive very little now, hence, it might be acceptable for me, but I'd like to warn others about this issue so that they can decide for themselves.le-plates has regularly been a problem.

B0053ZJYMM|5|The sticker is amazing! I put stickers on my laptop all the time.<br /><br />Con: I would not even call this a con, but after having it for a few days it got a scratch on it. The colors are great and the adhesive holds.
B00IR7DYLU|5|These lights where cheap. When I got them I hooked them up to a toggle switch and ran the wiring to my amp. These lights look puny when you buy them but at night while I'm sitting somewhere posted up with the squad they shine like 13 feet I front of my truck. These are a great pair of lights and I suggest them to anyone who wants great looking LEDS they are very bright and are very worth it.
B000C6IX1A|5|The old gas guzzler has been sucking gas through a thin straw... well... I just swapped out the old filter with the new and the car has regained some pep.  After getting all the fuel out of the old filter, I could tell it was noticeably heavier than the new one... that extra weight was the sludge trapped in the filter!<br /><br />Changing the filter was super easy, minus getting the hoses removed from the old one.  Once they slipped onto the new one, they were snug enough to leave on without clamps, but I tightened the clamps on anyways.<br /><br />The other 'challlenge' was locating the fuel pump's relay, which I could never find despite all the documents and 'maps' I used... It was much more simpler to find the power plug for the fuel pump and umplug it....  all for the purpose of relieving pressure in the line before the replacement.
B000E28C7M|5|the right product for the right price,
B000BTK62W|5|i have been looking hi and low for one to install on my 2002 F150 sadly i found it for less than $300.00 and free shipping close to home
B00KTI0D96|5|Thank you soo much they worked great! Will recommend to everyone!
B00EPRB9RM|5|They were easy to install and work very well. The steps have a little give to them, but I'm a big guy and I am very comfortable stepping on them.
B007P1JNUK|5|Thsi was a great deal for me. Ordered the key and it was here promptly. Saved about $50  from what the dealer would charge.
B001GJ3FIS|3|Have problems getting a good connection to hosel
B000W0PU5S|5|nice quality one key, love it.
B006OQQZTY|2|The molds that they use for this is not perfect and it is noticeable but i still kept it,  also They claim to use 3M for the adhesive portion \\"it is not good\\"  after 1 week two of the frames fell off on I-95... Yea it sounds funny. I emailed the company letting them know what happened. And they decided to blame me because I didn't wipe it down good.
B000EALHHG|5|Great for cleaning anything. But the real reason I purchased it was because it is great at removing the oils from Poison Ivy, Poison Oak and Poison Sumac from my hands so it does't spread on my body.  I'm not a big fan of wearing gloves while gardening, so when I'm working out in the yard every 20 minutes to 1/2 hour I wash my hands with Oil Eater and when I'm finished gardening I wash all my tools with it and throw the clothes I'm wearing in the wash and use it in there too.  So far this summer no out breaks of Poison Ivy, Oak or Sumac!
B00E1ETJNU|5|Love these Plates!
B00B00DJCU|5|Just what I was looking for.
B004KEJXGE|4|The long wrench is to thin it dont hold very good. Had to  use a cressent wrench. The other wrench was fine.
B0045L8YN0|5|20,500 miles later, chain is doing great and sprockets pretty good. Cleanest way to go, will never go back to the thin liquid types
B0002UEN1U|5|Yep, stuff works great... I used it to seal up my diff cover on my last axle swap... set up in good time and sealed 100%
B004ZG8FES|4|Seat cushion fit perfectly, replacing original cracked and worn.<br /><br />Recommended : make it simpler for yourself and take the seat out to mount cushion and restretch  seat cover... Not enough room on the seat belt buckle side to reach fingers in.  Also, I spray glued a piece of flooring underlayment to the underside (dry fit and trim tight) to help prevent future direct wear on the foam. Deducted one star for lack of wear protection.<br /><br />With no electrical/switch connections, it was about a 90 minute process, including dry time for glue.<br /><br />Do your butt and your back a favor, you won't regret it for the price!
B004CFHS1S|4|Perfectly good sheet of stickers.  They came quickly and are a great size for vehicles, etc.  I would recommend to others.
B007Q11PW8|5|03 Aztek AWD, FRONT sensor. Fits either front sensor, with plenty of wire to get the splice out of the weather. Saw a question about fitting the back sensors, NO it doesn't. The back has a short extension wire on it, so different part.
B000IYISO8|5|own a 2003 escape and this part still working without issues, don't get the aftermarket part, will be cheap but you will in trouble
B002XHDHPS|5|Many reviews stated how difficult it was to apply... it was so easy...took 10 minutes! It looks amazing & I've received many compliments, we lost our 4-legged baby & I have this under her picture. Would recommend to all!
B007LIBYMM|5|This item looks great on my HHR.  Well made.  Great accent piece.  Easy to put on.  A very classy item
B0002JMIEK|5|easy to use
B007PGQ4QG|5|These sunshades fit perfectly in my 2013 Toyota Prius C.  The suction cups along the edges are not necessary (but a plus) as the shade is snug between the window and door frame all by itself.  The shades are thick and well constructed.  Its really neat when the windshield shade and these side shades are in as its as if its night!...in bright sunlight!
B00IRWFQUW|5|it is very cute, but the shipping takes way to long.
B008427D88|4|These do not work with Polaris body panels!!!
B001AFQ918|5|Perfect addition to my car! Easy install and very good quality. Looks great as well.
B000FP8HUU|5|Product is exactly as described...works well, fast shipper...no regrets at all - the product is slightly expensive but still worth it.
B000WKLJNK|5|I use the oil in my 2003 BMW K1200GT and, at 32,000 miles, no leaks or problems of any nature.
B007NEHPYA|5|It's a little smaller than I thought it would be and there's like NO instructions for putting this thing on so I'm probably going to have to pay somebody to do it, but it definitely works as a rear view mirror, amazing clarity for a smaller mirror.
B0041CFX8M|4|I took a star off because they look great and function well, but the attachment A for the honda needed some pretty good sanding with a seemed before it would work without sticking for a vtx 1300c.
B000NPUJQC|4|I bought these because I had almost 100 loose craftsman sockets lying around and I wanted to organize them without paying over $30 for socket holders.  As soon as I got them I started putting the sockets on, and here's what I noticed:<br /><br />The 1/4\\" drive rail holds the sockets exceptionally well - very tight fit, almost hard to get on and off, which is good.<br />The 3/8\\" drive rail holds the sockets pretty well - not as good as the 1/4\\" drive rail, but very good still.  The sockets certainly wont fall off.<br />The 1/2\\" drive rail holds the sockets - I wouldn't say it loosely holds them, but if you're not paying attention to how you're handling the rail with 1/2\\" sockets some will fall off.<br /><br />This applies to short sockets.  Deep sockets hold pretty well - the only except is the 3/8\\" and 1/2\\" drive deep sockets which CAN fall off if you're not careful.<br /><br />However, for all practical purposes, you could hand these up and the sockets would stay on.  If you threw them into a tool bag carelessly, some of the 1/2\\" drive short sockets and/or 3/8\\" and 1/2\\" deep sockets MIGHT fall off.<br /><br />Overall I was pleased because I didn't have to pay very much and I was able to organize my sockets.  I may buy something slightly more sturdy for the deep sockets, but no regrets buying these for short sockets.
B006S4WU50|5|I get compliments on this all the time. Very unique and a conversation starter. I'm not even a huge Snow White fan but I love this decal!
B009X23B2U|4|Overall, I am pleased with the Switch Pod and would order it again.  However, there are some things you should know...The &#34;texture/pattern&#34; on the Switch Pod DOES NOT match the interior of the jeep.  In my case, a 2012 JK Wrangler, but it is close enough that it is not obvious unless you are a perfectionist like myself.  Secondly, it fits around the dash and the door frame pretty well, but not as well as the factory piece you are removing.  Cutting the holes for the switches is relatively easy...you need only to take your time and don't scratch the pillar.
B008B5X5GC|4|One sensor was bad. Others worked fine. Reused one of my old ones.
B005NFS58Q|5|This was a birthday gift and my niece loved it.
B001JT98IQ|5|My car did not come with an ashtray with my Hyundia Tuscon, and to get it would have costed me $40.00.  I bought this for under $10 and it works great.  It fit right in the cup holder.
B0055EVMLW|2|I was excited to get this purse hanger, but was disappointed when I opened the package and realized that the hooks are so tiny, there was no way my purse straps would fit in them. There is only enough space to hang very thin straps.
B004P20GEO|3|It is a little more complicated to install than the video shows, but they use two people.  I would recommend having a second person to help.  Once installed it does look good, and so far has done a good job of keeping the rain out of the bed.  The cab and tail-gait ends have some space between the cover and the rails.  The sides are easy to seal and seem to be holding well.  It is easy to roll up and gives full access to the bed in that position.  For the price it is worth the money, especially considering the $50 rebate.  I have yet to see how it will hold up against a winter’s worth of ice and snow, but it looks as if it will do fine.  I am happy with the purchase.
B0061XP7U8|5|AAA
B00LPP46GI|4|Super nice cover.  I love the colors and the materials.  It looks great on the car.  The only reason I'm not rating it at 5 stars is that the fit is not quite as snug/tight as I would like, and I have a ZO6, which is 3&#34; wider than a standard Vette.  To me, it would be too loose on a standard Corvette, but that's just speculation.
B0002TPVXA|4|Awesome product, price and quality!
B001PQIWKI|5|Nice mats, only wish they had the hold downs for the rear section.<br />Good price compared to MacNeil or Pelican, excellent fit for our e39
B000H774C8|5|This Auto Jumper cost $100 plus tax at Wal Mart. I can't believe I can get the free shipping and only $80 at Amazon and this baby is about 25 lbs.   Only false is it doesn't come with Extented cord for charging the Auto Jumper. I think Black & Decker is avoiding being sue or somewhat.  However, this Jumper works (Please read the instruction before you jump start a Dead battery car. Otherwise you screw car's electronic system.)  The best thing is this Jumper Not only Jump start your car instantly. It also able to Test your Alternator and Battery. So you will not be cheated by those lying dishonest auto repair guy.   If tested alternator gone bad. You know you have to go to repair shop right away becauce even you are able to jump start the car it could gone dead any time.   If battery gone dead. 1st thing you do is to check if the battery need to be fill up with \\"Distill Water\\"(regular water will damage the battery later). Don't over fill with Distill Water. Read instruction or call repair guy how much distill water should you pour in. If you over fill it with distill water. Acid will spill out from the battery. This strong Acid will start melting your car's metal body.  If the Battery Manufactural indicate this battery can last for four years. It is usually truth. You job is checking if the battery have enough Distill Water inside the battery.  You don't have to worry about POSITIVE or NEGATIVE connector. This Auto Jumper will let you know if you screw up POSITIVE connect to Negative.
B00020BM32|5|I bought this because I needed something to read the ODB I codes on my 1994 Pontiac. It did fine. It also read codes on my 1992 Dodge Diesel Pick-up.  Satisfied so far.
B005E3JWES|5|Looks good
B000E2CVIS|5|Good deal...
B00GWFOKYO|5|It's fun to have in your car, all my friends and family are amazed by these lights. Great to have, it's been fun.
B000BQWNRQ|5|standard snow brush, I like the longer length to it. It can reach higher places. It feels durable.
B005OTU8RC|3|The sweatshirt was way too big, but the quality was nice and it was what I was expecting. It arrived on time too
B005Q2SYSC|5|vary well they were steel nested of plastic. thank you
B00I8OFKPA|5|Good quality product exactly what I ordered.well pleased.
B00JHK81X2|5|This kit has everything I think I would need in a car emergency.  I'm going to add extra emergency blankets because I'm prepper OCD like that.<br /><br />I comes in a great carry case for storage in my trunk AND it has a cool &#34;I am the Stig&#34; window cling which will be the envy of all who see it!<br /><br />I think this was the best thing I got on Prime Day!
B00B6FVVGK|3|I received my product but it had scratches on two of the four center caps which were supposed to be brand new.
B002AK2RU4|5|It is really neat.  The light is smaller than I thought it would be, but will work just like I wanted.
B001JE32H4|5|just what i needed, works great, used it on my old ford tractor to shut the battery off when not in use
B000CIR1MU|4|these lines are great they fit exach as the old ones not a easy install but if you take your time it will take you about a hour im handicap so it took me two well made
B000C5BFQG|5|Perfect and original equipment from Ford
B000CSINYK|5|Perfect,just what I was looking for.Will soon purchase 2 more just like it,thanks...
B00JR4D7AA|5|the light system that I have my vehiclethe tape was bad so I replace it with this came out nice thank you
B00008RW9U|5|My cars love it!
B0052L16C8|4|The bag is not that big and it is as light as described. The only drawback that I could think about that bag is the side ones that are big, but they are not very well protected, but given the fact that they are retracted, I wasn't expecting something that hard shell, still good bag for your bycicle.
B0002SRGXY|5|Used this to press ball joints out/in my '74 Bronco axle (dana 44). No issues, and everything I needed was included. Good stuff!
B00LBGFODK|5|Exactly as pictured and described. When delivered, it was in a sealed plastic bag thankfully, once I opened the package for a second I was confused as there were two items inside. The part was wrapped in some bubble wrap but came out of the original box (hence the second item was the empty box). Overall no issues and the part was not damaged thankfully.
B004LF6Q1C|5|Great product, fair price, fast delivery.
B008MCJAFO|4|Perfect replacement.  Form, fit and function were as new.
B000VHXEJ6|5|Great stuff, Tuff,thick,does work,will line kitchen cabinets as well.
B0028QVM6U|5|it was great for what im using it for. im putting the sticker on a suitecase so I know what bag is mine at the airport
B000B8JUNY|5|Recommend
B0013JJJXG|5|Very easy to install,  very very solid construction.
B007D06F9U|2|Its a nice scooter but if you live around hills even small ones it tends to drop down to 10-15 mph worthless in my situation waste of money but I would imagin if you live in a flat area this would work fine
B004QEM784|5|Works great, looks and is really well built.  High quality forged construction with matt black paint.  Used only twice so far but loving it so far!
B000CMFTA2|5|These liners are fantastic.  The fit is perfect for my '06 liberty.  I live in the North East so our winters can get pretty hairy but these stand up to the mud, snow, rain, and dirt with ease.  I would definitely recommend these mats to anyone looking for a durable mat to protect their floors.
B0000AQQX3|5|This is my third Fulton trailer wheel. All of them work very well and it is probably the only wheel I would buy in the future.Smooth, durable, easy to install.
B005NHPBLS|5|These mats fit my Town and Country perfectly.  They are flexible and easy to take out to wash.  They collect all the slushly snow and mud thats always tracked in the car.
B00FY87XT4|5|as advertised
B004Y9YIU6|3|I got the lights in fairly quick. I hooked them up and they didnt work, thought i wired em wrong. So i tried one at a time. So to my surprise some worked some didnt. I ordered two sets so.... Only 4 out of the 8 worked for me. Now 2 of the others had some of the lights worked, but after i cut them they quit. Really bright tho so still happy, I guess.
B00HJEUUKU|4|Brighter than a previous brand purchased at an auto parts store because of more LED elements.<br />When retrofitting into a previous tungsten bulb system, they still need blocking diodes on the input of the running lights circuit so that the flasher and brake circuit does not activate the running light circuit.
B002OW0NYA|1|plastic design is weak.  Popped loose after our first trip and the plastic tab that secures it around the landing gear leg broke.  Useless if it cant stay attached to the landing gear legs.  Buy the ones made of metal.
B00522PH36|4|Nice filter, half the cost of dealer. 10min self install will save you at least 50$ over dealer.
B002P8ELXC|4|Not the same mirror as the one I already have but it did fit and works great. Good buy and easy to put on my suv
B008B7POUU|5|I was using the factory pyro with the Mini Maxx which was good with me but when I deleted the EGR it no longer worked.  You will need this if you want to view EGT and have deleted your EGR.  Works great and the install was a breeze.
B008K1W8WY|5|This keyless remote works amazing! Looks exactly like in picture. It was really easy to program to my vehicle too.
B0015PK3AG|5|I tried to get a working adapter through 2 or 3 of the other chain automotive stores and none of them worked, they kept slipping off when I tried to loosen the cover. At one point, I even had my car jack pushing up one of the other adaptors to the point that I was almost lifting the car and still it slipped off. Then i saw this one online, ordered it, received it very quickly (Prime is so worth it) and it worked like a dream the first try.  Awesome and completely irreplacable.
B00D8OFQUE|4|I was losing almost a quart per fill up (yowza) at 200,000 miles. After I added this (entire bottle) I haven't lost a drop since (2,000 miles) - an incredible turn around.<br /><br />The only issue is that this stuff is thiiiiick. It's like pouring cold honey, which of course is probably 90% of the benefit by making it too thick to squeeze out. My engine is noticeably slower to turn over (especially when cold) because it's like having 30W 60 in there, but runs fine once started. I'm going to do an early oil change using high mileage oil (for the first time) and hope the benefits stick around.
B000JZDN78|2|The bands that it come with suck! Replaced the boot on my Audi TT, and the next day I looked inside the wheel to see axle grease slung all in the rim in a rotational manner. I had removed the band, had an extra packet of grease- greased the u-joint and reused the &#34;one-time use&#34; ear clamps and to this day (2 weeks now) I have yet to see any evidence of grease.<br />I understand there are more expensive alternatives, but at least provide a decent clamp that doesn't actually clamp that right without the metal cracking inside one of the ears
B00CJ0GLK2|5|Great replacement for my '07 Range Rover HSE trunk struts.<br />Popped them off with a screwdriver.  Popped them on.<br />It took five minutes.  Used a rod to prop up the lid since I didn't have anyone around to hold it up.
B008U11NT8|5|excelente
B000BYD79G|5|Fit my 1997 Audi A8 4.2L Quattro perfectly.  Easy to install, nice smooth idle.  Highly recommend.
B005HAYDR4|3|Easy to get on the front door. I can't get them on roll bar for back doors.
B00A2XD8SQ|4|For a spare tire rack for my trailer it works great and is pretty universal. I did have to go buy longer bolts for it though, but, that was no big deal.
B001DRNNGW|5|This filter is an outstanding purchase for the price.  I searched throughout the internet and could not find a better price!
B001LHVOVK|5|It just works.  Easy, cheap, and reliable.
B004TCYONO|5|This is the original equipment air filter for my car.  It was much cheaper than an off-brand filter at an auto parts store.  I couldn't find a comparable filter at the the other stores that I went to.
B000CN56FO|5|great price, great product, will buy again. bought his for my car; definitely helped stabilize my shifter. easy upgrade. thanks
B00MS98MWY|3|Lights work great but the wiring was a little goofy with very vague instructions. Also on one setting only half the light shines. This was not noted anywhere in the description.
B0049984F6|1|I purchased this for my 2004 Honda Coupe V6 , installed in 5 minutes . Now , 2003 anything owners . I pulled all the crap off to get to filters on my 2003 Pathfinder AFTER I ORDERED THESE , SAID EXACT FIT. had a hell of a time . Been working on cars all my 61 yrs. I watched youtube and there videos , no one ever mentioned , CHECK YOUR VEHICLE FIRST TO BE SURE YOU HAVE A CABIN FILTER ,I have found out from the dealer , whom was laughing as I told him the story , that in 2003 cabin air filter was an ADDED OPTION . Would have been nice if they had simply added that comment pointed that out to me.
B00028FB8G|5|Exactly as described and worked well with my application...I used it for a homemade car rotisserie...stays in place and doesn't sink under load...highly recommend..great product
B004INE1SC|5|Good product. Great shipping and nice price. Installed effortlessly. Time will tell how it holds up.
B001CF4UXU|5|One of the worst things that can happen when you're winching your 4 wheeler out of a ditch is to have the recovery strap snap. The winch cable flying back can seriously damage your vehicle or you. This strap is rated for a 30,000 pound pull. I am not going to go anywhere close to that pull weight but by the looks of the strap I am sure it could handle that strain.
B00CM77OVC|5|Good filter and good service
B0044AXPMW|5|I always use the OEM filters on my vehicles; they are typically high quality, inexpensive, the valve settings/materials are correct for the application, and its harder for the manufacturer to give you trouble if you need warranty work.
B000NCOKQK|5|Great chargers
B003BZD03K|5|Very happy to have this connector . . . It made it very easy to hook up and disconnect my water line after initial connection. I disconnected the hose three times for different uses and never had to force my hand and fingers on the RV hook up. Simply turned the ears on this elbow an easily disconnected my water line..... It kept the hose from bowing and allowed me to work away from the hose connection on your RV.....
B005J8GWF0|3|a little oversized..
B001P1YTP0|5|Good
B0019IPRIC|5|Not just for cars anymore. Product works great near litterboxes, trash cans and as general room freshener. It doesn't spill or get knocked over, or overwhelm with floral scent. It replaces a 15oz gel and lasts longer.
B00K7IETZ2|5|Fantastic kit, highly recommend this as piece of mind if you're installing a SYE kit into your transfer case as it contains all of the bearings, shift fork pads, and seals you need (except the transmission to transfer case seal).
B006O1C0SE|5|This is a very nice, quality cover.  I received it in two days with regular shipping (USPS Priority Mail). The instructions are very good.  However it says it will take about an hour to install.  I must be slowing down in my advanced state of existence as it took me about 6 hours.  I would suggest pushing the needle through all the holes first so they are more visible... especially from the rear. And, as the instructions suggest, tight is right!<br /><br />But if you take your time and pay close attention to the stitching it will look great when finished. Patience pays :-))
B00652Y8BY|4|Short but with good info
B0035Z5FTS|5|Excellent fitment and build quality, definitely worth it...
B004AHADOC|5|Exactly as advertised. It is a bit frustrating the packaging doesn't tell you which fuse slot is for the original and which is for the new wire you are adding with the adapter. The packaging tells you to insert the adapter one way, and if it doesn't work, just turn it around. Then it states insert a fuse and find out which part it is powering. Doesn't seem difficult to place the information on the product or the packaging, even just using a dot in the plastic with the note &#34;Dot is original accessory&#34; or something similar, but maybe that's just me. Also, it covers a fuse slot when not used on the very end of a column or row. I knew this going in to it, but I wanted to make sure others are aware, also.
B000CII6XS|5|works well and lasts for weeks
B00C5YPCCU|5|Always a skeptic when purchasing through the l, but these are exactly the parts my husband needed for his truck And at a great price.
B000P17NXQ|5|Works perfectly....be sure to read instructions before first use to &#34;calibrate&#34; it, otherwise the brakes may be ultra-sensitive and lock up a little.  After adjusting the sensitivity, it works great.
B006NES8XS|5|These were exactly what i was looking for. And they look really nice on my blue fusion.
B0002GXP8G|5|good product price and delivery thank you
B003JHDTX6|5|I bought these for my friend.  They fit perfectly in his Buick LaCrosse.  They look great, too.  You can't go wrong with these.
B004IYWHTG|5|Replaced my original sending unit due to a rust-through leak in the supply line.  This replacement installed and works fine.
B0002LBGWI|5|Works
B0006H938M|5|Works wonderful!!! Love it!!!
B000P6TLYU|5|The manufacturer of these dollies claim that you can place them underneath your snowmobile.  Then you can roll your snowmobile around easily.    I received these items, and placed them underneath my snowmobile.  Low and behold, I was able to roll my snowmobile around, just like they said I would be.    Thank you, Raider SM-12165 Deluxe Mini Snowmobile Dolly, for being exactly what your makers claimed you would be.  You were what I thought you were, and for that, I let you off the hook.
B00J8W9TMQ|5|EXCELENT THNAK YOU
B002YI74U0|5|This product works well I have been using It for two years now. It was  recommended to me by my septic installer originally.
B0016C3STQ|5|It's solid steel.
B0096J90KW|5|Bought these for my 2011 Nissan Titan reverse bulbs.  100% plug-and-play, no modifications needed, no error messages.  Excellent light output compared to stock bulbs.  I ordered more for my cargo light.  Highly recommended.
B001AWLTX4|5|I love this thing, I bought two one for me and my wife. It keeps your face warm and its easy to put on. I got lots of looks from people its very noticeable.
B008OX08RU|2|IT TOOK FOREVER TO GET DELIVERED TO ME, I CALLED THE COMPANY TWICE ABOUT IT..  THEN WHEN I DID GET IT, IT WASNT ANYTHING LIKE I EXPECTED..  IT DIDN'T FIT MY HUSBANDS DASH RIGHTAND OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO VELCRO IT ON AND THEY DO NOT SEND YOU ENOUGH VELCRO TO HOLD THE DRIVERS SIDE ON MUCH LESS ANYTHING ELSE.. I HAD TO ALTER IT TO MAKE IT FIT..  WHAT A BIRTHDAY PRESENT THAT TURNED OUT TO BE...  VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!
B00029J3ZW|2|Still looks like new, it was easy to install, and it worked nicely for a while, but it's pretty pricey to have to change it at six months.  I didn't find any other similar switch to purchase, so I'll have to pry it open and see if cleaning the contacts will fix it, as another reviewer described.  I had it set to the lowest setting, so it probably turned on pretty often, but still, there are lots of cheap relays which run for years without the contacts getting dirty.
B0009YI40U|4|RAPIDO EN LLEGAR Y FACIL INSTALACION, BARATO Y GENERA MAS RENDIMIENTO DEL AUTO EN CONDICIONES DE CALIENTE O CON EL MOTOR CALIENTE
B00DDOSSLS|5|Perfect light.  Bright but not overbearing.  I'll probably purchased several more for my rv. Excellent product.
B003Y323NC|5|I love this.  I suggest getting the Edge 98601 external EGT Probe with it.  It installs easily and is infinitely configurable to your application.
B000IYR7CC|5|Listen, if you have a 1997 - 2003 F150, get these with a Hayden fan controller and two Hayden mounting kits and you won't be disappointed. I got these to do an electric fan conversion on my F150. The bolt holes don't line up, so I just cut the brackets off and used a through radiator mounting kit from Hayden. Works like a dream with my Hayden preset fan controller hooked up to run both fans at once. Perfect fit and much better cooling than the factory clutch fan. Easy way to get extra horsepower and gas mileage. My only complaints are that the shroud plastic likes to break easily if bent and the packaging could be a lot better. Two of the outer brackets were broke and a few inch section out of one of the fan shrouds was gone. Didn't bother me at all, since I wasn't using the brackets, and didn't affect the function.
B004YWPJU6|5|Excelente...
B005NHPBLS|5|These mats fit perfectly and catch all the dirt of our wet and often muddy boots. I love the fact you can just lift them out and dump the dirt, follow this with a quick rinse off and they are like new.<br />Well worth the money.
B007NNKA9I|5|Amazing
B0002NYDZ8|4|ok
B007C7ZQA8|1|did not work
B0030GDLTI|5|The starter was a direct bolt-on- No Mods necessary - Installed with perfect results - NO NEED TO CHOKE ENGINE - just throttle up, and spin it over - less than 5 secs. and we were up and running.  DISCOUNT STARTER & ALTERNATOR just got a returning customer if/when the need should arise.
B00DP3VAI0|2|BEWARE you need a working FOB and 2 keys to program this unit! You'll also need to get the key cut, i got lucky and had someone cut it for me for free because I have lots of keys made as I'm a used dealer. I only had one key for the Jeep without an FOB because I bought it at auction - ended up selling it without this product.
B00X3ENPJ8|5|Fantastic product.  Buying another one so I can do quick tire rotations at the track without lugging along a full size jack.
B003U1NPBW|5|Very cute and last a long time before needing to replace.
B00D3YEGO6|5|I absolutely loved it.  Great quality!
B0002JMM7S|5|I was able to tighten two sets of battery terminals on my GM vehicles without fear of rounding the corners off. They had been tightened up as much as I dared with a little open-end wrench. Now I have a longer reach, a slim profile for small spaces and an insulated handle. The ratchet action is great, easy to switch back and forth or you can flip it around 180 degrees.
B004O5949A|5|I bought this baby two years ago and never got a chance to use it.  This year we had a lot of snow in NY so had to clobber ice a lot.  This shovel is very capable of crushing through thick frozen snow in a few hits. It did not even dent or chip.  Very happy with it.  Finally had a change to test it out!!! Just bought another one for my brother.
B001RNOHBC|5|This inverter will power 400 watt devices, as well as charge something that has a USB charging cable.  It can easily charge an iPhone, iPad, Android phone, anything USB-powered.  It works well and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a low-cost but reliable inverter.
B007H2PYKA|5|I use this at work.  I have a problem with my foot, it swells during the day, so if it hurts too much I pull out my chair and put my foot up, and do work with my foot elevated.  It's a great chair for comfort- and if you aren't careful, you'll fall asleep in it.
B00029WSWC|5|This was extremely easy to install AFTER I figured out the clips opened.  I enjoy having this extra view & while another reviewer said there was a &#34;learning curve,&#34; I haven't found that to be true for me.  This mirror is so helpful it should be standard in all cars.
B004UGJRJK|5|starter seems to be well built spins my 225 motor over fast with no problems looks good and bolted right up
B003JCG3UW|5|The keyless remote was extremely easy to program and works perfectly.  If you need a replacement, this is the one for you!!  I purchased this for under $18.00 + S/H.  The Ford dealers ask around $100.00, or more!!  BARGAIN!!!
B003E2WQE4|1|Here's a idea give longer bolts and use straight square tubing for the receiver. Had to file down the holes on the receiver to make it work.    Fyi the anti wobble peice doesnt work on a trailblazer
B000KQ4IH0|5|Quick and easy to install, great price.
B005PK1EAK|1|My wife is only 4' 11&#34; so seat belts cut across her neck.  We had hoped that this would help.  As soon as we opened the package, we noticed that it says it is not to be used by adults.  We tried it on anyway and found that it is difficult enough to get on that it is a hassle if you want to move it to another seat and that the Velcro on the upper portion tends to rub against your neck and it is not comfortable. It also tended to get twisted and was difficult to get the seat belt on correctly without having to check to be sure it was not twisted.  We returned it for a refund.
B00O2AXTHK|5|I was going to buy the bush wacker brand but didn't want to spend $500+. I decided to give OxGord a try since they look pretty much the same. I have owned bush wacker fender flares in the past and the OxGord is a very good product pretty much same quality as the bush wacker. Besides it being in a plastic bag when I received the fender flares it appeared that they were scratched, but it was a thin plastic layer protecting them.
B00FH3YB5K|5|Awesome product!  Great seller!  Totally recommend!  This was very easy to install, even if you don't read the instructions!  Great idea..  I can't tell you how many times my son has stepped all over my purse!  Great price, well worth it!  You must have a center console or it won't work... Keep that in mind!
B00FM1CKK0|5|Perfect! I got this for my daughter's doll house!
B0055DOT7C|4|I think this helmet works good and was a great price, but the forehead material rubs me a bit, will have to fix that, overall a great deal.
B007GCDRR8|2|Batteries did not work but a couple of hours. After charging 24 hours. Received order quickly. Had to go buy one aaat the store.
B00OZETW42|5|At first I was a little skeptical because the part looked really old and the sticker had started to peel off. But it was a perfect fit and everything works on my scion now.
B000CF8W1W|3|Arrived with scratches from bad packaging.  There was some plastic between the separate pieces in some places, but not all.  I was too impatient to return/exchange, so I just put them on with the scratches.
B003EOTN6G|4|These bulbs are brighter than oem or any other brand I've tried.  If you are expecting a huge improvement over your existing bulbs you will be disappointed though.  If you are wanting to see much better at night you almost have to go HID or buy an additional lamps to mount in the bumper.
B001GJ3FIS|5|I was tired of buying nozzles that would flake out after a month.  I bought several of these after reading the reviews.  They are awesome!  Great value and they work perfectly.  We are in FL and we use our hoses year round.
B004KEJYAY|5|great little oil can for price
B008DREON6|2|Works fine but the panel has no plastic or cardboard backing to keep its form, so with the elastic straps holding it in place it tends to bow towards the middle. Otherwise works okay.
B00HS5KJFQ|2|they fit just fine, but the front set throws a lot of brake dust and all four are really squeaky
B0036XGKDY|5|this is holding up pretty good had to ask for an iteam that wasent included but other than that its working flawless
B000PA03AC|5|This cable came with my used 2003 540i with DSP. Worked perfectly until I uninstalled it when I put in my Dynavin N6.
B00BCRMAAS|1|These seat covers are not worth any money, first of all, misleading, I specifically looked to be sure they would fit my car, 06 chevy equinox, it said they did, they do not. the head rest covers are to small, so useless, the seat covers for the front are two piece, not one as the directions say, and do not fit the seats, it will cost me almost as much as I paid for them to send them back, so I guess I will eat the cost and just advise anyone else not to bother ordering them. also the backing material is so cheap it tore when trying to get the seat cover on. The material itself, not the seam. Very disappointed in this company and will  never purchase anything from them again :(
B008AFUQMO|5|good product and with lowest price,<br />i love the it since I don't want spend more money and buy<br />from automobile showroom,
B005NLQAHS|5|just as described perfect
B0052SF0LO|5|My husband ordered this and he has it mounted on our patio with the solar unit attached to our roof.  It really lights up our backyard patio in the night.  Quite impressed.
B000OZSABW|5|Needed something sturdy to protect the seats of the Polaris ranch Ranger that is used every day- twice a day to feed horses and do the chores on the ranch.  Ranger gets a real workout and the seats were showing the wear.  This cover is doing it's job and looks good to boot!  Was happy to find out the seat covers do not absorb water as the Ranger is stored outside.  There was nothing worse then planting your behind in a cold wet seat!  Liked the price too!
B000MW5SJ4|5|I've attempted several times to use other types of grease to lube the ES bushings on my car several years after installation to no avail. The closest thing I personally came up with was NAPA's version of this stuff. That works great short time but does not compare to this stuff. Finally I broke down and got some of this. Decided to get the larger container so come time to renew all these ES bushings, I wont run out like last time!.
B00029WYEY|5|good
B00CAX5A6Y|5|perfect job in my car
B006FP6LS4|3|Feel like I should have only been charged for the pendant . Clasp broke the first time I tried to use it. No use as a necklace now. Dont think id order from this company again
B00514AOCO|5|as described, fast shipping-day early, easy install, great product, very happy wife on back of H-D, seller added as favorite AAAAAA+++++++++
B008A1NMEM|5|I installed these brakes on my honda and am very pleased with the results. This was the easiest install that I've ever done and they work great!
B00MC6RQAM|5|Outstanding what more can you say just outstanding
B0081HRNZY|5|If your in need of parts...order from Ricks MotorSport!!! Parts arrived on time and Are workin fine!!!
B005PJJ89U|5|very nice to have a memory function is very help to ref. the driven about the tire air pressure psi.
B003BAE2JQ|5|This was a new produce in perfect condition and was easy to install. I works great! it was shipped fast. I've needed this for months and have put it off. I Checked out prices online at various sites for this rear center tail light and the best deal was on Amazon.com with free shipping and I knew I could trust getting the product through Amazon. So, I got the best price - Free shipping(no check out surprizes with additional costs
B001U60T9U|2|That back seat cover, was confusing and was not able to fit it. I did not like the zippers on the back seat cover.
B000GX9FSY|5|As a member of the DC Chapter BMW Club of America, I was skeptical about purchasing anything other than OEM parts for my 2000 BMW 323 iT Wagon with 150K miles, but after hours of research on blogs and forums, all DIY owners swore by this product citing that the OEM parts are more or less rebranded with the BMW logo.  For example: BMW's Fuel System Cleaner is $19,95 at the &#34;Stealership&#34;.. check the bottom of the bottle folks - says &#34;Chevron&#34;.. so went to Walmart and bought the Chevron Fuel System Cleaner for $6.95. Saved $13.00...the I called the BMW Parts Dept, they had no comment.  So owners can save money if they just do a little research for themselves.  Very Happy with the Product.
B0022UP8XA|5|Very nice fit and quality. I have had other brands of covers in the past because I was looking to save $$, but this cover is well worth the few extra bucks you have to spend to get a quality product. It fits perfectly, came with a storage bag, and it looks good too!
B000BQP6F2|5|Exactly as described. Was delivered quickly & installed easily. Perfect match to replace on the quad.
B0033WDDQA|5|Lift the back of the wagon to clear the springs if you install this hitch on the ground.  Other than that, it is built right, works and is priced right.  UPS beat up my box during delivery, but Curt made the hitch much stronger than the box, or UPS!
B0002JMRXC|5|My door closes like new,  the bushings look and feel the same but they are different diameters so be sure to measure them and install in the correct side of the hinge. Use a nut and bolt and some washers to press the bushings in so you don't damage them. I have found that garage door spray lube works good to keep them lubed at every oil change
B001TQPLKI|4|I have installed the winch on my trailer, the product was delivered as advertised. I have not had an apportunity to use the winch much, but it works okay.
B007LIB6AW|5|Great
B002R1OFGU|5|Perfect fit! Thank you!
B0002NIKJS|4|The ones in my last truck were much better..  but they also cost three times as much.  These are good sturdy mats that will get the job done done light duty.  Being able to place in the truck and trim to fit was a nice feature.
B004I0VPXY|5|My son backed into the mailbox and broke the back taillight. We found the part here along with an online video showing us how easy it was to fix it ourselves. Saved us a lot of money doing it ourselves.
B00D9C2CDO|2|Product is made very well. went on a 900 mile trip, no rips or tears in material. it states that it is waterproof, that is not the case. my wife's suitcase was wet when we arrived at our destination. she had to wash all her clothes. also, it killed my mpgs's. i normally get 24-25 mpg on hwy, i got 16 mpg. cost me way more than it should have to reach our destination.
B00HJAMBI8|4|Very good and as expected.
B00K6RE51W|5|I am in between a small and medium. Great all around riding jacket.
B001OMKVHA|3|I like it and air moving through the Jeep is awesome. It has held up in high winds. I did drill a hole in it right over the screw so you can remove the screw with a screw driver.
B001O02LDY|1|Drone is horrible at low rpm under load.
B000XY4Z0Y|5|I purchased these with the Kuryakyn Freeway Bar Mounts and they were easy to install.  These pegs are well built.  They can be adjustable as well.  I had to purchase a long 14mm socket nut so I could tighten/adjust the angle.  We worth the investment.
B000R8F47Y|4|good quality...Ford F-150 fits cargo bed nice.
B00FEQU79O|4|Got the tire cover, but no air freshener. Not a big deal, really.
B0059JHASW|5|Great price, great filter.
B00092893E|5|If you own a Ford with an Ecoboost engine, this product should find a spot on your shelf and use it every 3K miles. The only other alternative is to use Chevron gasoline if it is available in your area. This is the ONLY detergent known to &#34;reduce&#34; carbon buildup on valves and not destroy your turbo chargers. Ford does NOT RECOMMEND any fuel or oil additives for the Ecoboost engine family, HOWEVER this detergent is provided in Chevron gasoline as an additive and Chevron gasoline is a top tier gasoline recommended by Ford. There is a lot of debate and concern about carbon issues with direct inject engines, not just Ford. This product does help to delay the inevitable.
B00CGFPW64|5|sturdy and better than most
B0002UQ9Y4|5|Looks like it will work just fine!
B0007LVJ20|5|good quality
B005H12QXG|4|Fits and looks like OEM mirrors.  Only difference I see is it looks like they angle up more than OEM mirrors.
B0022Y58JA|5|Good fit, looks good on the bike. Fits fine with the Klock Werks 8.5&#34; and larger shield.
B000OAEN7C|1|Guy at the autostore said this stuff might work on my Corolla motor oil leak, did nothing at all, zero, zippo. Did as instructions said to do to a tee, oh well, guess there is no &#34;mechanic in a can&#34;.
B002ZBPXGS|3|I would think the water and some other conditioner would work even better. It certainly usable, but I had to use actual soap to clean my seats and then this.
B005FUX2WI|5|great ligth
B004NIFC3A|5|Awesome goggles
B0012OD33E|5|Snugs right on the velcro backing pad, lasts forever with minimal wear and tear on the pad.  I used a single pad to buff the whole side of a 40' motorhome without a hitch.  Definitely recommend!!
B000E28K7O|5|Works perfectly
B006X8BATI|5|Worked great, easy to install.
B00JB3Z2AU|5|Excellent quality stickers. Easy to install and stick to surfaces extremely well. I will buy from again
B00Q8DNV1I|1|Can this fit a 2003 Impala?
B0001EFSTI|4|I've had one of these on my keychain for three years now. I actually lost one (took it off, used it, and left it somewhere), and I bought another one. It's that useful. The great thing is this really is as small as a housekey and has similarly flat profile, so it`s not much of a cost to have it on your chain. I can't say the same for my Leatherman (great tool, but really only for home).<br /><br />The hard part is remembering you have this on your keychain. The next hardest part is how inconvenient to get this on and off the keychain. Good thing the blade isn't that sharp and that it`s tight enough that it's not going to fall off the keychain by accident! Last, I'd say is after using it to remember to put it back!<br /><br />The most used attachment is the blade. I use it to open packages and other small jobs. After that, the bottle opener which works though it is hard to use (and is the reason I bought it in the first place, to replace a keychain bottle opener). I think though over time I've used almost every attachment once (except the hook thing which I don't know if it even counts as a tool) in order to go MacGuyver on things. I really don't think the screwdrivers look nearly as good as the tools I use so I wouldn't put much faith in them beyond an emergency.<br /><br />I usually take this thing off my keys when I go air traveling, but sometimes I forget. I've never once been stopped yet, but I figure it may be related to how I have this placed relative to other keys which may be occluding things in the X-ray machine or just luck. The couple of times I accidentally dropped in my Leatherman I was caught (every time) and had to mail it home before continuing through security.<br /><br />I wish the tooling on this were a bit better. There should be a law against using \\"Swiss\\" in names for stuff made in China. :-D If Leatherman made one of these, it would totally rock. Alas, I think most people are so cheap they would be turned off by the price.
B0027XY5JA|5|And it had a good price! Everywhere else charges an arm and a leg! One cannot lose here especially if they have Prime!
B000LE6AXG|4|These are really great seat cushions.  They are comfortable.  Both the heater and massage work very well.  The controls are simple and easy to use.  I bought two, one for the driver and one for the front passenger seat.<br /><br />A few minor improvements which could be made to this product:<br />1) Hi / Low Heater Settings would be nice<br />2) Adjustable straps in all locations would make it stay in place better<br />3) A pocket on both sides for the control so I could choose which side the control is on.
B00065WO4Y|5|great product  good price
B0002Z9QWQ|5|Going strong so far. They have been through a couple months of rough Minnesota winter so far, and they have performed flawlessly.<br /><br /> These should definitely be considered for places with inclimate weather.
B00B4S2MBM|5|Great replacement for the original carpet mats, that wore through quickly. Keeps the wet tracked in contained.
