B00EEDWSC2|5|I use it to attach my camera mount to my helmet. Its held up even at 120 mph so im happy
B000GOHUN0|5|Exact replacement and works fine.
B000C59YKA|5|Fit the car great and had no issues..would buy again.
B00CU9SQUK|1|Horrible quality! Don't buy! Packages came damaged and one was even open! Ashtray was scratched and damaged. Cheap product.
B00DIPSA8I|5|Great for rear window display!
B001OBGINM|4|It just didn't fit the vehicle that it was needed for so had to send it back.
B00RN6F7B6|1|this is not a temperature switch for the A/C
B005DXNL0A|5|Love this Box.  I really like the fit on my ATV. I like the fact they include the straps to attach to the rack.  Really like this box. Its big and roomy.
B001IAHWTS|5|as listed
B006H34BUY|2|Doesn't really pick up dust on car dashboard. Should have just bought a Swiffer duster.
B00S8ET6N2|2|These are some of the best priced fender flares you can get. I had mine painted and there is no issue with the quality of the material itself.<br /><br />However, the fit for my truck is definitely off. Especially with regards to the inside and underside. I will include pics to show what I am talking about. The fact that they do not conform to the underside shape of the truck, makes them look cheap. Granted, my 2013 F150 Supercrew has wheel well liners, but it shouldn't really matter.<br /><br />Install was a little tricky. I had to use some double sided tape to keep the top parts attached to the body. Again, fit was off.<br /><br />*Update*  I ended up taking them off after just a few months. The coverage was too wide for me. Taking them off was a real pain and it also left scratch marks around the flares where it would rub against the body paint. The metal clips used to mount it rub against the inside paint and looked like it was starting to rust.<br /><br />Still, you have to pay more than double this price for the Bushwacker brand and even more to paint them.
B001C3MFFC|5|Nice bag, matches my Mustang seat. Great bag at a nice price
B000C5A1OI|5|Worked perfectly on my son's '94 explorer Sport. No issues.
B00QHA3356|5|This worked perfect I replaced a shattered mirror ,saved a lot of money and you can't tell it was ever broken.
B000EDQQHO|5|as advertised
B00C305EQK|4|Mirrors fit perfect no problems.  The finish is off by a little compared to factory not enough to stand out unless you are really looking.  Overall nice.
B00S755UGO|5|bought this for my 2013 chevy volt and i couldn't be happier.the distance these bulbs throw is outstanding and flicker free.easy plug and play with no cutting of bulb base to fit and no blinding on coming cars.perfect fit to my great car
B00G258I0G|5|We have a pop-up camper with just one step. It slides out nearly straight. So, there's a bit of a hike up to the step. I'm um... vertically challenged. Yeah, I'm short. And, I have bad knees. So, doing that big step up was NOT a pretty sight, and I just kept waiting for the day I fell face-first into the camper.<br />Luckily, this arrived before I had a chance to fall. It folds up very easily. The legs adjusted quite easily (if you have trouble getting it to adjust, a bit of WD-40 should do the trick. Just spray right at the &#34;dot&#34; with the push button. We didn't have to do this on the step, but have had to do it on some awning poles that worked similarly). The &#34;grippy&#34; feet seem they will do great at holding the step in place.<br />The shortest setting was the perfect height between the ground and the step that was already there.<br />To store, we flip it on its top, folded legs facing up, and slide it under our table. Then, we can store things on top of it when we're on the move.<br />The non-slip strips are GREAT, by the way. They even grip in the rain!
B000CQ49X6|5|Nice set of sandpaper array.
B007USCM7E|5|great product
B003UO1IV8|3|Not bad. The strap ripped off and my wife sewed it back on for me. It keeps my seats clean.
B00A8MZ7IA|1|Don't like these towels for glass.  They leave microfiber lint.
B00HU6N3LK|5|BUY THIS SH*%$%OT NOW. BADA BING!! Don't make me come over there...
B004QCBLJC|5|that´s ok, a good piece, grand seller
B007JSGR9Y|5|Vendor provided excellent customer service. Product is as described. Completely satisfied with my purchase.
B00DHGPVKI|5|This charger works on Optima batteries and all others, but is exceptional at charging the Optima brand. I charged one battery that was discharged to 11.2 and another that was down to 9.1. I assumed the one at 9.1 was bad and bought a new red top but after buying the Optima Digital 400 this battery has found a new lease on life. I would highly recommend this if have any color of Optima battery as this will prolong the life and save you time and money replacing these batteries.
B00R5Y8IOO|1|too hard to install and set mirrors
B00M5D8D54|5|Worked fine at one fifth the cost from dealer Thanks
B008G32B1O|5|Perfect! Was exactly what they said.
B000B6JJUK|5|that´s ok, a good piece, grand seller
B003QUWNY2|5|Best short ram for ej2  with dc header custom test pipe and dc scs7020 my ill d15b7 pulling hard on those :-)
B009PN9ZMC|5|Works perfect, Fits perfect for a Lexus Gx460
B00GSAUHB8|4|works great.  My only complaint is, I still can't fold it correctly 100% of the time, so it just ends up shoved between the seats.<br /><br />For those of you who said it didn't fit your Sonata, I have one and it fits fine, just pull the sunvisors down to keep it up.
B006HI4XCK|5|Exactly what I needed at a very good price.
B012MZGKOU|5|This is a very handy little device. All cars made past 1996 will have a port (usually under the steering wheel area somewhere) where you can plug in OBD2 scanner devices to collect information about your vehicle such as if your check engine light is on you can get the fault code to find out what exactly is happening.<br /><br />This specific one is easy to use, just find the port on your car, plug it in and press the power button, it is then ready for your phone to connect. In order to connect you go to the wifi settings on your phone and find &#34;WIFI_OBDll&#34; listed and connect, no passcode is needed. Once connect you simply open an ODB2 app and connect to the device. The most time I spent on this was finding an app that is compatible with wifi ODB2 scanners and also had a friendly UI. I decided on &#34;Piston&#34; for android because it met both of those needs<br /><br />Once connected the device shows you a ton of information such as battery voltage, coolant temperature, intake air temperature and more. It can also track your speed and gas mileage if you are driving with it on.<br /><br />Overall this is an incredibly simple item that provides a lot of information, if you are diagnosing car issues or simply want to know what’s going on under the hood I would pick one up.<br /><br />Do keep in mind that since this uses a wifi connection from the device you will not be able to use internet on your phone/tablet you are connecting with until you disconnect.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review
B00MW8G2IW|5|Nice and easy to program
B009AIHOHA|5|good
B005QPPSG0|5|Perfect
B00WA1U7MS|4|I am quite please with my recent purchase of the Tire Pressure Gauge.  I am a 74 year old man and the tire gauge  works out very well for me with the easy to read digital display and bright LED light.  It is very comfortable to hold and fits good in the glove box of my truck.  A little pricey but what do you expect for this day and age.  I plan on purchasing 6 more for my 5 son-in-laws and my fishing buddy.
B000E2CUCU|1|DIDNT FIT
B005CJ0824|5|If I could give this product - and the company's GREAT customer service - a 10 star rating, I absolutely would!! This bumper protector is the real deal; it is made of solid steel, exactly as described and unless a trailor rides over it I can not imagine it bending or breaking. In addition to that, which is actually what initially caught my eye, it has great style and therefore does not look ugly and stiff on my car; I regularly get comments on how cool it looks! This is my first lease and I have a sweet little sports car, so the last thing I wanted to do was ugly it up. I live in Brooklyn and people around here really park horribly; they couldn't care less what happens to the next person's car so I was searching all over for the right bumper protector until I finally found this one! I bought the set: 4Bumpers Prime and 4Bumpers Duo. I recommend you do the same!!!! A few of my friends have purchased the set as well, after seeing it on my car :).<br /><br />Now. Regarding customer service -- Wow. I am majorly impressed! I had some questions and was concerned about receiving the right information. I left a voicemail and within 1/2 hour received a call back from Jeff and he went out of his way to answer all my questions and make sure I walked away as a very satisfied customer! If you have any hesitation, just call them and leave a voicemail if you don't reach anyone - you WILL receive a call back and all your questions will be answered, and more!!<br /><br />As for my experience with the product so far (I purchase it a few months ago, just never had the chance to write this review until now) I already have a number of scuff marks on the rubber part of the protector -- which automatically tells me that had those protectors not been there, I would have had those scuff marks on my car, plus definitely some scratches and dents which these bumper protectors prevented from happening! I've also found a car in front of me totally backed into my car but the bumper protector stopped him from touching my actual bumper! I'm attaching a photo of some the scuff marks so you could see what I'm talking about, as well as the one where the car was totally backed into me. A cool option you have is that you could remove the rubber parts and just keep the metal as is, or even sharpen it, and when someone touches your car they're just gonna damage their own car! I was actually concerned whether the weight will be too heavy for my front and back bumpers, but it is just fine. I even verified with my dealership whether lots of driving will wear off the screw area and they said it won't. So far so good!<br /><br />Don't hesitate --- order yours now! I'm a big fan. :) Good luck and drive safely!
B005JOAOX0|5|AWESOME!
B00XLJIDUG|5|Excelent product. Easy to install and control.
B008RIEQXY|2|One light died a day after installation.
B00FJXKE5E|1|Device does not reliably connect. Tried to address to company, but issue still persists.
B00IDHJZXU|4|I have only used this a few times. We will try the heavier windsock on the mics on our next ride as it is hard to understand the other rider at higher speeds. Connecting the devices seems to take a few minutes. I think the manual could be more informative. We use 3/4 helmets, so it allows more wind noise in. But I previously owned another brand, and although it didn't have all the options of this one. It did sound better at higher speeds. Hopefully the thicker wind sock will solve our problem. Over all. The product is good.
B000ZIZHKK|5|Best buy for the money! Great product!
B00G258I0G|4|Have been using the stuff for quite a while now works very nice. Traction tape though starting to peel up
B000JFJM14|4|Does great job.  Pulls oil from bottom of engine.  No need to jack up my 3-series.
B00D3YEGO6|5|Beautiful license plate frame. I purchased this for my best friend who drives a BMW. She lives it and it is very well made. Great packaging for gift giving too. You will not be disappointed.
B00FW1DRZC|5|Fit is really nice.  Not sure how they compare to weathertech for this model, i can see these lasting quite awhile.  They also stay looking cleaner than the carpeted ones.  And they have more traction, not that its needed.  Lastly, i have a tendency to wear in a spot with my heal, this should solve that problem.
B000LQ9YEG|5|excellent item. Fast shipping.
B00NUE88FW|5|Great size and look
B00823FSRC|5|This is my first kyack cart. It took a few trys to figure it out, but once I got the hang of it, it has saved my back.  It is light and stores easily. I recommend this product.
B0002JMV06|5|as advertised
B000BUU5Z4|5|I installed this in our RV and have 2 battery operated spinbrushes hanging from it and it has worked nicely. Adhesive is quite strong. I noted some reviewers mentioned toothbrushes fell out. I cannot say for sure, but if that is happening I'm thinking RV/camper is not level.  That is only my opinion. I personally have not experienced toothbrushes falling out.
B00F0VSL2S|5|Perfect fit for my 05 S60 R.
B00UVIO1EW|3|The grips have to be cut and modified for a Ducati.  Very difficult to get on.  Once on, they're OK.  The metal ring in the middle is always loose.  I wish I would have left my factory grips on.
B000TYTSH8|3|This works in kia cadenza 2011? (kia K7)<br />PN - KNALN414XB5036272
B003T7XUE4|4|still works great  since its installation for 2 years now. quality product,  one suggestion to the manufacturer,  would be much much better if a simply cheap plastic cap( protector) is included, it will serve a function of protecting it again road dust in the spring load area and lever.  then I would say , it's 5 star plus product.<br />cautions, you shall expect it drains slower than without such valve installed.
B007GRT088|5|Fit perfectly
B0002SPH44|5|Wife very happy I got this product, it puts all other glass cleaners to shame she says.  :)
B00SITDUI4|5|yes!
B00UDEZKYO|3|The description says &#34;dual size&#34; and the photo shows two funnels, however only the yellow funnel is shipped. I thought it was a mistake so I returned and requested a replacement - same thing. I'm sure the one funnel works fine. I didn't try it since I was intending to return it yet again. The yellow funnel at least is exactly as pictured. It has a significant amount of flashing around the edges of the funnel and also in the ball valve, but it shouldn't significantly affect the flow of liquids through the funnel.
B008BC8G7S|5|Worked perfect for my 2003 Chevy Silverado .
B000YEQP10|5|Exact replacement, no issues at all during install.  These pads have lived up to the manufacturers claims- Low dust, no noise, great stopping power.  I would buy them again or recommend to others.
B00651OAVS|5|Great price, when I need more, I know where to find it.
B00652G4TS|5|This is very handy scan tool for mobile devices
B00OFUB3IO|5|Nice low profile lighter.
B003BZD08U|5|This is a &#34;must have&#34; inexpensive piece of equipment designed to protect your RV's water systems from potential water problems.  Water pressure in campgrounds can often be a moving target and this small investment should always be attached to your incoming water lines.
B00ARJQAA8|5|It works, firts time -- not much else to say... Yeah!
B00SH1SN6C|5|fantastic product, works like a charm
B00GPUIZ3S|5|Love it
B00G0M6OTI|5|Perfect
B00SITDUI4|3|The item is worth for the money.
B000BUOSGG|5|Just the right size for my mother's unusually odd shaped double sink.  Had been looking for a replacement for the one she had used for years.
B0023VFB2G|5|Highly recommended, fast delivery, (hope I won't need to order again) I will be more careful when backing up in the future)!
B0040MF13K|5|Exactly what I hoped for.  Fit perfectly in my Nissan Altima 2001.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Great product, great service, and great price !
B00LV8P9BU|3|Small
B000CSQEV4|2|I bought this product and put it on and it was broke from the get go. Cylinders 4 and 5 are cracked. Had to put old one back on because it was only misfire in cylinder 3
B004VNJLHU|5|I have a 2012 tundra white in color and it turned out awsome but when i got it in the mail and put it up on my truck i thought the wording under the 4x4 was to much didnt look rite so i took a blade and took the words off i think my son put them on his Xbox but all in all very pleased dont look like some cheap sticker
B0024ECJSQ|5|Bought bunch of these. These are the ones that fit my standard batteries in '76 & '93 Chevy 4x4's
B00DWKXZL6|5|Great bulbs, nice and bright plus it's nice it has the rubber grommet on it as well
B00EECM5FI|5|great product! at our local auto parts store one bulb ran for $100! got 2 for less than half of that and they work great in my 2006 Nissan Murano!
B00XM7DLHC|5|My fianc&eacute;e bought this and loves it, although it took some manipulating to get it to fit correctly (bought for a 97 Jeep TJ). Over all was good.
B003W0FSV6|5|Works great for cleaning up patches of glue when using basting sprays or other fabric sprays.
B000W0RQ8C|1|Purchased the item for my new Ford F350 SuperDuty Pickup with a Factory Installed Class V hitch.  The amazon description and the packaging says it will fit a Class V hitch.  It was too short to fit,  Could not get the lock on.  Now they want to charge me $6.00 to ship it back to them because of their mistake.
B00MYI89JA|5|Worked great.  easy on.  it did take a few days of warm son and driving for it to fully conform to the antenna and roof
B002692308|5|Fit perfectly. Order arrived within a couple of days. We are very pleased.
B00EKW1NEG|5|Just the right size for me. I did not think about my truck having tinted windows so I put it on my trucks body.
B008G233QM|5|Looks like the original equipment and fits perfectly. .
B008VHUIQK|5|Installed it and AC unit started right up.
B00PQIVX34|5|Loos great.
B00VELE71W|1|broken lens
B007C6CGPW|4|Cute antenna ball.  Hope he stays together.
B00NDWFCDC|5|الإنجليزية<br />Very excellent and well worth more than 5 starlets
B00BITJUPS|5|HAVE,NT RECEIVED THE PROTECTED FILM FOR PHONE YET.
B00GJY78YM|5|Shipped fast, packaged well,happy with product.
B0068EROUQ|5|Great deal
B005Q1JE50|5|Make's my tire's look new again and again.
B004YTOJ4G|5|Nice mounts.  Be careful not to over tighten them as they will crack the cast aluminum mount.  I had to buy a second pair due to my overzealous cranking. LOL. Rock solid.
B00BCRMAAS|1|Had a little bit over a week an they started to rip all over the place
B0013G0J9W|5|Good quality.  make sure you have assembly lube for the gear and conventional motor oil in your engine for the break in requirements.
B00WQOCKME|4|I already have each of the tools in this set, but always wanted to have duplicates so I could have a set in the house & another in the garage. This Ford Pliers Set fits the bill perfectly. They're solid, seem well made (for mid-line tools), and the price is pretty good. I keep these in the garage, and have used them quite often; I'd recommend them to anyone looking for a good back-up set.
B007ZLL3H6|5|worked out great
B000AME50Y|1|Didn't take away scratches!!!!
B007PZL61A|5|This is even cooler than it has been described.  Bought this for my daughter to have in her car.
B00AF4TSRC|5|Excellent product, perfect fit.
B005C5AL34|5|Perfect fit for my bike!!
B000HUE8Q0|5|World perfecto<br />J1collazo@live.com
B0016HYLG0|5|love it !  easy to install, less then 1 hour. looks great. glad i bought it.
B00493V684|5|calibrated right on, i compared it to a mechanical test gauge. I had previously used another brand and it was reading 20 lbs low.
B00P68L9RO|5|HD chord. No voltage drop here gents..
B00Y1VWM5A|5|As far as digital multimeters go, this is one of the higher quality ones I've tested that were under $30. The guy is not only backlit but also comes with a built in stand and comes with everything you need to test voltages across many platforms. I dropped this many times and it's very rugged, leaving no damage whatsoever anywhere that mattered. I will be using this exclusively till it breaks, will keep my review updated when that happens.. if ever.
B00K7YMK3E|5|looks great! only thing is when it gets wet it gets water spots inside the plastic which looks weird but go away as it dries but definitely is as expected
B0057ZQJ12|5|Well made. Bought the 10 ga.  Good tight contact...
B004YB99NU|5|Works great for carrying of my work id and other small items that do not weight a lot. Carried a red bull in as well. Looks cool. Fits nice.
B004BHCNQW|5|Clean, classy, exactly as pictured and described. We'll have to see how it holds up over time, but it seems like good quality materials. I'm not concerned
B005LEZUDC|5|First class thank you.
B000AR7KVA|5|This stuff is fantastic.  It seems to take any clearcoated surface from final sand (2000) to high polish shine.  I used both a cotton tshirt and foam buffing pads just as well.  I started out using too much of this, sort of like car wax.  But just a pea size dot can do near a square foot.  This agrees with another comment that this bottle is a lifetime supply if you use it right.
B00I37W7EO|5|good product, excelent time of delivery
B0049MRO9U|5|This made the installation very simple to.  I was done in ten minutes!  the hardest part was laying on the ground Tie wrapping the wires!!!  Great product!!!!!!
B00H5C9LGK|5|Excelente product, over my expectations
B0006SU3QW|4|Came exactly when expected,but the can was dented from the bottom other than that it was fine.
B0074OLGS0|5|This was a gift to a ravens fan and he loves it.
B008032LHE|5|Fit great and is working will
B008VQLU40|1|Sorry to report the ball joints were the incorrect ones for my 1974 Lincoln cotiental so I returned them.
B00PJPHEBO|4|This Panlong Bluetooth OBD2 (OBDII) was a free sample paid by a promotional coupon. My review is based on my personal opinion and any rating I give is based on my trial of the product. Each product is tested at least by me to ensure it works as described.<br /><br />I have tested out other OBDII devices in the past but this one blows the others out of the water. First reason for this, the box has very simple directions and an app to download. (You can even scan and download automatically!)<br /><br />Now, to make this work, you have to do the following... Install the suggested reader on your phone or tablet. (Or if you have an app downloaded, you can try that one.) Find the diagnostic port on your car and plug this in. Turn your car on. Now, scan for the device with your Bluetooth. Connect. Open the app and see what is happening with your car.<br /><br />This is a device that most people won't need. It is geared more towards mechanical minded people who do their own car work. Or towards geeks like myself who are nosey about stuff going on with my car. Depending on your car and your app, you can test a vast range of things. Everything from engine workings to pulling up error codes. Don't be a dingbat like I was. I was so excited to test this out that I went outside at 2 pm when it was 86 outside, climbed into the car and closed the door. I was so busy testing out the program and looking at the different stats on my car that I came close to getting heat stroke.<br /><br />This device is a pretty blue color which doesn't matter one way or another working wise, but it does make it easier to see under my dash than a black OBD2. In short, this device works well. I removed a star because there are no actual directions regarding the use. I prefer more than \\"scan this to install app on your phone or use X program which has a fee.\\" (Paraphrased) I knew how to use it because I have already tested a few, most people are buying one, not several. Bluetooth vs wifi hook up is a major plus!jor plus!
B005OS5F58|5|good
B000EPXUTO|5|bolted right up and works super.
B0002JM69W|2|did not last long
B00E4HCBZ2|1|Horrible product.  I specifically bought these very expensive gloves for an endurance motorcycle ride around Lake Superior.  I tested the gloves when they arrived and they worked.  Since it was June in Washington DC (and very warm), I saved them for my cold ride scheduled in July.  When I needed them for the ride, one glove didn't work at all and the other glove immediately became disconnected when I moved my arm to grab the handlebars.  I couldn't stop because I was in a group of other riders on a timed ride.  I endured the pain of moist 45-degree air moving over my hands for 2 hours until we stopped for fuel.  I pulled-out my old gloves and two 10-hour heat packs for the rest of the ride.  I'm currently drafting a letter to Amazon.com and the manufacturer requesting a full refund.
B00K890RBU|5|Description was extremely helpful in selecting this product. Packaging was top notch for this type of product.
B009K4H42Y|5|Mower Partsmen is the place you will get what you ordered, A-01 filter fits Honda 2016 fit,  all doe the web sit has no info. on said vehicle. will buy again from this vender. and this will fit 2015- 2016 Honda fit amazon web. say it does not fit, but does......1.5 engine
B000CKNNJ8|3|Good
B00FWOKKGI|5|For the price, I don't believe I could have made a better buy. Very affordable, super bright, all hardware included.... Very pleased.
B00YMM9SDW|4|Less than an amp of power. Works good with my solar system.  Very bright. I know it is primarily built for a vehicle but I use it to light a cabin with a small solar system.
B005OQYCKE|5|Very nice
B008M7SVBS|4|Looks very nice on Tire. I didn't put the little Anti theft thing in he stem. Too little dropped in the tire or on the Ground and couldn't find it. So just said forget it. Looks nice on the tire though .
B00A6AS6LY|5|Worked as expected
B001AIZ5HY|5|Made a huge difference. If someone told me that they wanted to polish my headlights I would have assumed it was a scam. Noticeable difference in brightness during day AND night.
B007NMHOO8|5|Matches great to my 03 dakota
B001HSIBOQ|5|fuel pump works nicely
B0065SIPBC|5|awesome, USA
B0049MTGLO|4|Fit my 2012 highlander nicely
B000C59ODC|5|This is the original part and it work excellent
B0082195GO|1|MAYBE IT'S ME, BUT SERIOUSLY TRIED HARD TO APPLY WITHOUT LEAVING ANY FINGERPRINTS, BUBBLES..<br />GET A SOLID COLOR.. TRIED TO TAKE A PICTURE, NO LUCK..2012 MONSTER 696 DARK
B00K7938O4|5|Good product
B00144AKJC|3|Good quality sun shield but despite being well packed, it arrived with a horizontal crease where it had been bent.  It was a little disappointing after paying a premium for this accessory.
B005JU5UX8|5|Looks great on the car and wipe well as they should. They don't leave anything behind, don't skip and are quiet.<br /><br />They are replacing a set purchased at Costco that lasted only 6 months. The previous wipers tore off during a rainy drive and thanks to Amazon's fast shipping, these arrived quick. I live in a Phoenix where it rains little and the car is parked in the garage so I expect my wipers to last a long time. I will revisit this review later.
B001BFKW4M|1|not illuminated----difficult to set up--------almost impossible to read
B00QK411AS|5|Worth buying
B00GSAUHB8|5|The quality of this shade exceeded my expectations, both in terms of functionality and construction.  Very easy to twist up, secure with attached elastic band and slip into 'pillowcase' for storage.
B000N5JREM|5|Great deep tone but not too loud, just the way i like it
B000VLC84E|5|A little difficult to install by myself. So far I really love it. Takes maybe 5 mins. to put up and the same lowering it.
B00062YQV6|4|It worked for what we used it for
B007TY6Y0K|5|worked great
B0015AC9QC|5|Great product
B003BZQ9SI|5|Great product!
B004J0UHRI|5|Smooth, quiet operation and the quality seems good.  Both motors are larger than stock which I'm assuming is a good thing?  Anyway reuse your old shroud!  Leaving my oem shroud in place saved a lot of time and effort.  I found the easiest way was to remove the drivers side fan from the top and the passenger side fan out the bottom. (My car is a 2000 VW Jetta TDI with A/C and manual transmission)
B00BLX1L4O|1|Not good at all, cheap & flimsy, not packaged well either. Very unhappy.
B00EX9OPPK|1|Missed the return date.  These were labeled the correct vehicle but these parts did not work it's not what I bought
B00BD4SKY0|4|Ordered these for my Pontiac Grand Prix GT. And they fit great and match perfect. Great price for matching covers. Amazon is great for selling them as a set and not separate.  They are breathable cause I have heated seats for the winter.  Perfect.
B00HJ6YTCS|5|nice
B000H8U37A|5|Fit was perfect for 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee
B008L5J5G6|5|After having to replace 3 previous plastic handles I decided to buy this metal one. Nice product. Five+  stars.
B00407NK6A|5|Worked well I'd buy it again
B00Q7GESUO|1|One of the straps broke as I was trying to put it on. Disappointed.
B00W6J19EY|4|Great way to keep your window open on a rainy day without getting wet. They were a little difficult to apply as the 3M glue/tape is very tacky and unforgiving once it's applied, I was a little off on the front window and lost some of the 3M trying to adjust it. My advice is to use two people, worked better on the remaining ones.
B008AL2F6S|5|Great value, quality, and service. This supplier tops my list for items I need.
B00IT87MXS|5|good
B0067UEIVY|5|AAAAAA ++++++
B00XKTT30Q|4|Wish the cargo net covered more of the trunk otherwise performs as promised.
B0009IQTRQ|5|Exactly what I ordered, but these filters are impossible to find a local stores! (for '84 Subaru GL Wagon with 1.8L non-Turbo!).  Even the various online references come up with a rectangle-shaped filter.  It fits the car, and improved the engine response immediately!
B001PTTG1E|5|Very easy to install. Perfect lighting for 300 ninja. Love it
B009SQET0Y|1|Cheap!! I went back to factory after they fell off in the middle of the road!!
B000GKB0IK|1|Toy
B002WM7KBG|5|excellent
B000GTZ8K2|5|bought for polaris indy trail 1997 fits great and looks good. comes with stickers. had to modify cables a bit for them to reach. Not as high as i would like but without cable extenders it wont work. Durable too.
B00BN44QYS|5|Gift for my nephew....he loved it!
B000C8T96Q|4|works fine
B00EG84RFQ|5|Sent a dud then sent me a new one great thanks
B006DWTGM2|5|Worked like a charm!!! Thanks!!!!
B009DIXU8E|5|Work really well on my vehicle and very easy to clean
B00KSUA6HY|5|They did the job.  All the gauge warning lights in my Acura 3.0 CL light up like a Christmas tree.  Had to slightly bend the hooks up on the base so they fit, however.  Other than that, they work great.
B00O1KHWMO|5|working excellent
B00KTIAUEY|4|So glad I bought these. I just wish they were a little more &#34;heavy duty&#34;.
B00RYPBHNI|5|Very durable sticker
B00REJX5BQ|5|Well, I installed this cover today, installation was simple and easy, quality feels real good, I have a 2014 Ram Big Horn , no Ram Box, and it fits perfect. It also came with strips for different beds but mine has the plastic strips on the sides. This top by far is an excellent buy for the price you cannot get one better than this for the price I paid for this.
B00HQT2K7O|5|Quality of product was really good and we received them on a timely manner.
B00KX8XMDG|2|Not quality tint material. Fit was good
B00407V4F4|5|Worked well I'd buy it again
B0043DL69E|5|simple to use, reusable, fast shipping!!!
B004303BNQ|2|Cheap but does the job. Absorbs solar heat and becomes scorching hot.
B00L1EKGBM|5|Fantastic!! Its fix well for my ram15002013
B00HZB9E90|5|Love this decal! Put it on my laptop!
B00F3J2FW4|3|Front passenger side fit is off on my 2015 wrangler
B00KWMO7V4|5|Very durable
B00L3YKSXG|5|Cute as can be fits wonderful and easy to apply.
B005DFN8D8|4|Love the color & that it's not one piece. I just wish the instructions were a little clearer on installing. Because my straps came undone for the back part.
B00F0VMMSW|5|Normally with many disk brake jobs a simple &#34;C&#34; clamp can be used to squeeze the caliper piston home.  A brake caliper wind back tool is very necessary on many models that must be simultaneously rotated and pressed home.  I can't imagine trying to do this with a pair of needle nosed pliers!  GET A WINDBACK TOOL and get the job done fast.  (Don't forget to crack open that brake caliper bleeder valve first!)
B00J4Z7YT2|5|Just what I expected
B003CJGDE8|5|Used this product to sync a set of carbs on a 1978 Honda GL1000. I followed instructions specific to syncing that particular motorcycle and the product did great! Now I have a nice tool to keep the carbs in sync.
B00QFSAPP6|5|harness is a good one I have had it for a short time so far so good I went down some rough roads I would buy this one again matter fact on the next led light purchase I will buy this one it's again
B001J89BHU|5|These are very nice mats for the money.  If you tried to buy them in an automotive accessory store you would pay at least double the price.  They look exactly as depicted in the photo, arrived in just two days, and I am very satisfied.
B00MQ5Z5F2|5|Works great handy to have around
B00OOCP1TU|4|They work as advertised. Nice product.
B0066RN5AI|1|Switch was intermittent and would work if pressed in partially with finger but not work when pressed all the way down.
B00KQ7WDZW|5|Love it it's in my trunk in the car everything fits in it
B00VJ4LHUS|5|I love this car trash can. It's made well and is very convenient.
B00JN1OYA4|4|This antenna was pretty easy to install once we figured out which of the little metal screw pieces fit into the antenna mount on my car.  I am a frequent radio listener, so I was concerned that the new antenna would not get the same quality of reception as the antenna that came with the car.  For the most part, this antenna gets good reception, however it is not quite as good as the original antenna's reception, even when the original antenna on my car was falling apart.  It sometimes loses reception when I come up to a stoplight next to other cars.  I think perhaps this is because the antenna is quite short.  It does look nice on the car, and it gets decent reception most of the time.  Update 12/12/15 - Now that the antenna has been installed for a few months, it is still getting pretty good reception.  However, it is no longer black.  It has turned a brown/coppery color, which I'm guessing is due to rain & sun exposure.  If you care about the color of the antenna, this one may not be for you.
B00MSU5Y1U|4|No
B00K10NGIC|5|I like it because of its size and it fit right in the palm of my hand for a nice grip when shifting gears
B00G0KRHK0|1|Runs out way too quickly
B003K5S4NW|5|It works just like its supposed to. Don't put unnecessary pressure on it, it's plastic, it will break (duh). My windshield gets real dirty fast, so I clean it with a homemade windex type cleaner, then finish with this to eliminate the streaks/film left over.
B00DSD6LS6|5|Awesome great music wish I would have caught on to Zaxx sooner
B0009JRVWC|5|Product is great very easy to install
B000C2UDXK|4|well made
B0002F66G0|4|It looks nice, but it isn't easy to install.  The inside is lined with felt and it sticks to the rubber tire.  That's handy for keeping the cover from falling off, but it makes it difficult to install.
B00E9I1EW2|5|Easy install on a JK, and even came with a relocation bracket. I have read that the wheel does not return to center on its own, but I do not have that issue. Steering is definitely controlled and tight.
B00GZHX2SY|5|Accidentally broke one of my bulbs when I was re-wiring the ballasts to a better location.  The replacement bulbs work perfectly.
B0008F68MG|5|Very heavy duty, works as advertised.
B0030CI6HY|2|I had to scrap the regulator part and just use the motor because it was bent. The bracket popped loudly when raised and lowered. I didn't have time to send it back for another one so I just used the motor and it turned out fine.
B00FS0WFAA|5|Received promptly, Worked great!  Just what I needed to install a new driver seat bottom and foam in my 2008 F150 that I purchased from The Seat Shop online.
B0093PJ3TC|5|Amazing seller, very helpful and great products!
B00BLAG3D6|1|The original unit I recieved and its replacement were both defective. The units worked for about 30 seconds, then most of the leds just went out leaving three or four working.  Exact same issue on both units, so maybe they have a bad batch or something but I will have to order something else.
B001NZS9A4|3|OK
B004SZC7JK|5|Great product. As described. Easy interaction.<br /><br />Thanks
B000EPSEKO|5|good timken
B0009IQX6I|4|very nice wax
B00170L4ZC|5|Perfect fit, no whining or slippage at all. Only time will tell how long it will last, but I do not foresee any reasons why it would fail prematurely
B007KPWU8I|5|Looks great on my 2006 Street Bob, and came with no scratches or blemishes from what I can see.
B000C9I77C|5|Returned for full refund. Part incorrectly listed for my vehicle.
B004IUKTKY|5|Perfect for the price! I would def buy again.<br />1/2 the cost then buying this at a store and works the same!<br /><br />You got my bisuiness with this Amazon!
B00S5ZGEPM|4|These do the job eliminating errors on my 2007 BMW (E60). However, they get extremely hot and must be properly mounted on some METAL surface. I would advise against &#34;letting them hang there&#34; (risk of them touching/melting other wires) and certainly against mounting them to a plastic surface which will surly melt.<br />Also be careful when touching them after some current passed through them - risk of getting burned :-(
B000HZT89C|5|Great
B00BYV4CKI|5|Fits perfect in the 2016 RDX front and back.  Will definitely hold and liquids spilling and very rugged.  The back long mat will not fit if you have the Advanced package because that has a larger center console, so keep that in mind when ordering.
B004RBY1LW|1|This fit perfect. Came out in a reasonable amount of time. Very satisfied with this product. Thanks so much.
B000HEBR3I|5|Had one before, use it all the time for the mowers.  Glad I found it online, very hard to find during the summer.  Makes transferring the gas so much easier, less mess and fuss.
B00NANYIB6|5|Perfect fit for my Dyna
B004GIPCE6|5|Great
B000BZI4KM|5|Works perfectly on my 2000 Nissan Sentra GXE 1.8L. One of the down-stream Oxygen sensors went bad after replacing the catalytic converter. I replaced the bad one with this item and passed the strict California SMOG. It costs about half of the &#34;direct fit&#34; ones, and the installation is actually pretty easy. Highly recommended!
B00NQ451TC|4|I absolutely love the look of this and everything fit my Taurus, but I do wish it was better quality materials. Fast shipping though!
B00F0X3FWW|5|Fits perfect and works great!  Highly recommend this product and this seller!
B00REJXVEW|5|It fit my 2012 Ram Big Horn Quad Cab perfect. So easy to install. It looks great and it is fulfilling its purpose.
B00M9NJ8V8|5|Comfortable fit and broke in easily.  Size is true.
B0002F68JK|2|After consulting several users that insured me it was the correct mode.<br />WASN'T! !<br />It cost me $8.50 to return it for credit !<br />But buy getting the 2407 I discovered on the outside of the box which was the correct one to order.<br />Long story short, never believe the comments posted on products.
B006EFU4GK|5|Worked perfectly.  I'll never buy an aftermarket sensor again! Thanks
B000CQSPVS|5|perfect
B00JU3QPIO|4|very nice but they are not molded to the contour of my 98 mustang so it doesnt sit flush against the fender. Havent lost one yet but that's my fear. UPDATE After 2 years they are still on and the chrome finish has not peeled. Very good
B00NBN1C78|4|I wasn't aware that this was for trailers only, and not for cars. It says that in the product description, so the fault is entirely my own for not looking before leaping. And this is not just about attaching the fancy box. This jack is not rated as being strong enough to lift the weight of an entire car. MAYBE it will work but I certainly wouldn't want to risk it!<br /><br />If you DO have a trailer, then this set is great. It mounts onto the trailer itself, saving you space, and has everything you need in one handy set. I love the collapsible tire iron in particular. Very clever space-saving device!<br /><br />A great set all-in-all! Just make sure you read the fine print!
B0052XMSBE|5|Good product, reliable brand. The price is very good on Amazon
B00K0VMXDQ|5|I received a Brightech Scorpion Portable Car Charger from my son as a Christmas gift.  The power and portability is amazing.  When my lawn tractor's battery died I didn't have to push the tractor to be near my car for a jump start. I also used it on my car when it was parked in the garage with the front of the car facing the rear of the garage.  I will never have to align two cars or a lawn tractor and a car for a jump start again. It is so compact I can fit it in my back pocket. I like this product so much I just ordered one for my brother for his birthday.
B0015LPSAK|5|These work really well on my 1998 Ford Expedition.  They work better and last much longer than the regular wiper blades.  The regular blades I usually have to replace yearly.  These NeoForms can last over 2 years.
B00B5ZYY38|5|Makes my license frames look super clean. Easy to install and definitely worth it to me.
B00X5GS1CU|1|Bought it in june for emergencies.  I have never used it and now it's dead.  Charged it all day and absolutely unresponsive.<br /><br />buy at your own risk.
B00N34HC4W|3|Didn't fit exactly in the model of motorcycle that I own. I had to make do.
B001U8QP8W|5|These seat covers are amazing, there strong enough to stand a 3 year mess.<br />Thin material but for the price I think this is a great product.
B0000AXY62|1|I used this thing one time and time and it broke. The actual receiver pin is great, however the keys are terrible. The first time I unlocked the pin from the hitch receiver, the key broke off inside the hole. Making the prodcut worthless.
B000BNZPSI|4|Worked well
B006VFR37G|5|After 12 month of daily use and a long road trip in the SW, it worked flawlessly. It has only one screw to lock the knob, but it never moved. No visible wear so far. Great product.
B00KNCEMF4|1|Product does not dry to be able to sand. Directions say 10 to 15 minutes.  Not dry after 24 hours.
B00L86H20G|5|Works Great !!!
B008R8ZFCU|5|Excellent for driver and second row for my 2015 Acura MDX, and my 2008 Chevy Aveo5, both of which have Type A in the front (stops the belt buzzer for quick trips down our driveway to get the mail) and Type B in the second row window seats (for my small dogs elevated bed). I recommend this for my vehicles. My Toyota Tundra uses Type A in front and back. I hope this helps.
B007XE8C74|5|DODGE RAM 2500 Diesel 2004.... I did a lot of searching around, and was wary of the cheaper versions and some of the feedback. It appeared,(wrongly or rightly), that diesels are slightly different, and may not connect - i am not an expert.... I have a 2004 Dodge Ram 2500 5.9 Diesel with a Crankshaft Sensor P0336 code (using my mates ODB scanner). My cheapo Bluetooth plug in didn't read the code so i needed a 'decent' one. Just received this and plugged in. Pretty straightforward to understand without the instructions. It successfully connected, and read the correct code. I also erased the code with this device. I will play further with the live data etc, but for the price and what i needed it for - perfect. I now need a new crankshaft sensor, and hopefully this will be in the draw for another few months
B004GCHN8K|5|It arrived exactly as said to and is what I was looking for.
B00CKKFDPA|5|Was received very quick and was easy to install. Instruction did not tell you how to install the LED strips but with some 3M double sided tape you can mount them anywhere.
B005Q11JV2|5|Great sticker............have not had any problems with it.
B00GHKMKT6|5|Worked perfectly - solved the issue I was having with jumpy acceleration.
B002DQGV6Q|4|It does what I need it for.Able to give fair weight when charging for freon.Very happy with it & can't beat the price.
B0012UK3M2|5|Received the product promptly. I quickly and easily installed the bulb myself and what-do-you-know, it works. I now have 2 working headlights again so people won't think I am a motorcycle.
B0000AYJFD|5|Perfect OEM change of spark plugs on my Yamaha
B000CK7N1M|5|yes
B00WUZZW38|5|Great Item. Excellent service.
B00JQVVGJI|5|Will this fit on my 2014 Honda Accord coupe it's not the v6 4cyl
B0000AY2Z6|5|I read all the reviews on this and ws a bit skepticle at what people were saying about the noise of fan. ordred and used it on our first camping trip and I'll tell you it works fantastic with great air volume, normal fan noise, nothing out of the ordinary. Would highly recommend and in fact have orderd a second unit. Great product does everyhting it says it will.
B003ZWHLCU|5|Great product and constructed very well!
B006CPMARS|2|When I took the key fob to the Nissan dealer, they could not get the actual key to work. The key will not unlock the door to my vehicle. The key fob buttons work, but not the key that comes out. If I have an emergency, I cannot unlock the door if the battery goes dead in the key fob. I was disappointed.
B00KTHZEZK|5|These were perfect, I had them cut and programmed by my locksmith and would recommend these sellers to anyone in my circle that needs replacement key Fob's. Very Happy. Thanks a Million.
B00NCA8W3M|3|Die cuts were a little deep causing the vinyl not to release and got a couple of minor stretching spots in those areas.  Otherwise looks great
B00FZQ1DB4|5|This was a perfect replacement fit.
B0007LMC1C|5|Great brush for getting those tough to reach spots. Have had it a couple years and it holds up well.
B00CPSWKLC|5|These applied easily and have lasted through many rainstorms and car washes. I love it!
B00IITSE6C|5|very nice  fit and work perfectly
B0061R32JC|5|Great fit easy to install
B00EZ4WDBQ|3|was leaking from the neck out of the box but I used some teflon tape to reseal it...otherwise it was a perfect fit.
B00VAMT058|2|NEED A SHORTER CYLINDER.. WHICH ONE TO BUY? One that will fit. We can not DROP IT LOW.<br /><br />Screws were missing
B001KQA9IG|1|Does not fit a 2008 350z
B003UM7B98|5|This jack works great!  The only issue I have is that it is so big and heavy - you'll need some space to store it!
B00HE68ESI|1|Awful product. You throw your shoulder out trying to unscrew the cap and after it does come apart the paint goes flying. It also looks awful when applied.  I'd like my scratch back compared to this.
B001OKFE9C|4|Works well on auger
B004X5QRVO|5|This fits in my 2004 Hyundai Elantra (Avante) perfectly. This radiator was intended for an automatic transmission Elantra (whereas I have a manual transmission). Despite that, I just needed to remove the transmission fluid cooling intake rods from the bottom of it, and it fits in nice and easy.<br /><br />I have to say, this did not come with a radiator cap. Be sure to save your old one, or buy a new one.
B00Y5GJBVO|5|The shift knob fit my car perfectly. I love the size, weight, and feel of the new shift knob.  The shipment packaging was excellent, and it arrived on time.
B0009H52BG|5|Fram almost always has it down on these products, but most importantly the price is also down. In a relative sense when compared to their competitors. Point is, while it is essentially glorified perforated threaded tubing with cardboard inside, it does the job it was meant to do.
B000NWA8HU|5|Plugged it in and no problems. Took 10 minutes o install.
B00T9OCBTG|5|It fit perfectly, went on with no problems, and starts great. A great value for the price.
B003JOB594|4|works ok not really impressed but ok for the money
B005FZZ1YU|5|Excellent grease
B000MIPCRQ|5|It's been on 3 weeks now and holding up well. If you use this patch go for a long ride to cure it. It smokes and stinks in the driveway.
B001V71J42|5|The kit arrived in good shape and includes everything the ad says it should.  The air adapter unit seems to be made of pretty solid material, so I'm not too concerned about its ability to withhold the pressure of the CO2 can like other posts have stated.  Speaking of.... it also came with a sheet of directions on how to properly use the air adapter.  I have a feeling that some of the other folks may have disgarded or not received them, and that may be the reason their adapter exploded.<br /><br />I'll update this if I have the need to use it!
B004UR2DRC|3|Very sturdy ladder that was the perfect size for use in our motor home.  Would be better if the steps were deeper for us older folks. The grandchildren didn't have a problem with it.  Mama & Papa did but are still able to use it.
B00GT4S53K|1|had to bad balest ig they weren't good
B000BQSIWK|5|I am very pleased with the product
B00U0XPNSG|4|I received the set of valve stem caps and key chain quickly and are as described. The caps went on fine and look good on my 2015 Silverado. I like the key chain as i can use both ends. If the key ring was metal and not plastic, it would be 5 star item. No complaints as price was more than fair.
B00NL5IGOS|4|Great little style pad<br />Didn't know it had place to mount until after went through pleather<br />But cool and cheap
B0017R5EHO|5|Solid little unit. I was expecting cheap flimsy plastic. Worth every cent! I ordered both ESI 307M & 308B. Just what i needed.
B00L6FWK0G|5|very nice wheel center caps look and work great!
B0002L6X08|4|The sunshade fits perfectly for my van and I like it. The experience was great and kept me informed about the shipping.
B004LN52EQ|5|Perfect,  exactly what the picture  shows
B0081T3PP4|1|used as directed, air temp went from cool to warm. I would not recommend this product to a friend.
B010156EIA|5|perfec
B00F7FILRC|5|Truly the best of the breed.  One of the first and one of the best.
B00KTHXJHK|5|Worked great on my 2006 4Runner.<br /><br />The locksmith said it wouldn't work because it had the wrong transponder. He was wrong. I programed it myself with no equipment needed.
B00CFALFXY|5|Product came promptly and met expectations.
B00BUFWNAE|5|This is great stuff . I was amazed at how little was needed to wash my SUV  and leave such a clean and shiny finish. I purchased the gallon container so I guess it will be about 2yrs washing my SUV once a week to use it up.
B000R85IB6|5|this would have been very tough to find in the stores, Good old Amazon  :o)<br /><br />should be perfect color match to the Monster Energy lettering color :o)
B006FLMGGO|5|good gracias
B00CRT8D5Q|5|Awesome riding shades
B00EZOUPCA|5|These are amazing little bulbs. I replaced 8 incandescent bulbs in my RV and these look just like the bulbs they replaced, minus all the heat! I could not be happier. One note, they only worked in my RV in one direction, so if at first it does not work, pull it out and turn it 180 degrees and reinsert, and you should be fine. I highly recommend these to any RV owner!
B008PZY3VE|5|Mine arrived dented and damage due to shipping.  My fault for not checking the packaging when I got them.  I did not install these till about 3 months after I purchased them.  However, the damage is on the underside and you can't see it.  They are fairly light, and though not super solid, they are solid enough and they work great for their intended purpose, which is to be a step bar.
B0044AZ426|5|original
B004JPNKDQ|5|exactlythe right product needed
B00KQXKG46|5|the best price.
B0024E70L2|5|You need to understand that this adapter plug will not work with GFI receptacles. If the outlets are standard then everything is perfect.
B0002KKJ1I|5|This makes my top beautiful and seals it very well... Great buy
B000F15G58|2|The mat didn't fit my dash correctly.  There are some extra holes in it that don't belong.  It covers the dash to keep it from sun damage though.  Not impressed.
B002H9CMCQ|4|Good stuff with nice coverage.  Seems to last about one Ohio winter, but touch-ups are easy.
B001MOVN22|5|Works as good as the original when my 2002 Buick Century Limited came off the assembly line.
B00SS0OJCO|5|Works great
B00K9T8FTK|4|Perfect size and color!
B00B1ZJAFO|3|Nice idea and it works OK.  But two of the brushes just fell out - it was not made well enough for the brushes to stay in place.  In order to use it I had to fit some cardboard shims behind the brushes to keep them in place.  The little ridge/indent is not sufficient to hold them steady.
B00KVJB7IY|4|Had about 2 months now and still glowing strong!
B00IKJ2W54|5|work fine, great price!
B000BZI150|5|perfect fit works as expected flawless
B00RXRSJB0|5|Installed these myself on my 99 Alero. Went in with little fuss.  Now the car sits noticeably higher and rides much, much better.  Very happy with this purchase after about 3 months of use.
B004GCDPW8|4|quality piece
B000C2EC82|5|Thanks perfect fit on 2000 GT mustang.
B00DP5NWBQ|5|Worked as described
B003CH577Y|5|arrived quickly and holds the pads easily, the change over took afew minutes , but no problem, just need to use the wrench with the buffer , has enough flex for contoures
B00L2T0TRC|5|Great product! Looks good, very well made! Was packaged and shipped quickly!
B0013C7QFQ|5|They are awesome looking mats! They fit perfectly and have deep ridges to hold water, snow, or slush.
B004I12T42|5|Looks like original and was plug and play....everything was included! Highly recommend.
B000MOGX3M|5|Perfect for my 2015 Tacoma! Easy to install, too!
B007Q1K6EQ|3|The resistor is the same as original except the mounting points are wrong. Connections are good and it functions as it should. Original has a three point mounting, two are used and the third aparently for choice. This one has only two.
B0031I3TNI|5|everything was great received way before the deadline thank you
B0052XHBO8|5|good good
B007KSY5W4|5|works great..
B00G3JI0UY|5|good
B004FFEAJS|4|This kit definitely helped but is not 100% accurate. The &#34;U&#34; clip that you use to check which blade and location id less weight than the weights that come with the kit. I happened to measure each and got 2.8g on the clip and the weights were marked 5g and were pretty close to that. So, If your checking with less than 3g and adding 5 grams (though this doesn't sound like much) don't expect you fan to get to 100% balanced!<br /><br />Heres the rundown on how it worked for me. I did some research on ceiling fan balancing beforehand to make sure I was touching on all the bases before I got started. I did check and tighten all the screws that mount the fan blades on each side, checked and tightened the fan mount at the ceiling, measured each fan blade at the tips to be sure they were exact distance from the ceiling on each blade, as well as thoroughly clean the blades. This alone made a slight/better difference. So I suggest doing this first!<br /><br />Lastly I used the balancing kit as instructed and as per videos I had watched. Now. with the clip, before adding weights I initially had the fan dead on smooth, but after adding the weight it was slightly off, Just a minor imbalance. Seeing how it was perfect with just the clip I wanted the fan to be this way all of the time! So I went through the process again adding the clip to the blades trying once again to get the balance perfect. Once again, I got the perfect balance, no shake, no rocking, nothing. Added the weight, slightly out again. I must say that overall the fan is 98% balanced and no one would really notice but for me, I saw the fan TWICE perfectly balanced, I mean perfect! So I spent more time than needed trying to get it right as the problem lies within the difference in weight between the clip and actual stick on weights!<br /><br />If I could do it over again, I would buy the kit that has the 3g sticky weights as it looks as though it uses the same exact clips, so when you get your balancing correct with the clips, the balancing will remain correct when you add the weights!<br /><br />In the end. I would recommend the kit if your not as &#34;OCD&#34; and just want a better balance but if your looking for the nice, smooth, let 'er rip on high w/o a whim, then look elsewhere my friends. I gave it four stars because it got my fan better, the loss of star was due to the difference in weight between the clips and stick on weights as well as actually seeing perfect results with the clip but not after adding the weights!!t with the clips, the balancing will remain correct when you add the weights!<br /><br />In the end.

B00KZJQ2L2|5|Large shade, great for my tundra. Love it
B00FB3MT7S|5|Dope sticker.
B00ZM9LANA|5|This is a pretty good organizer for the car. It can hold snacks diapers drinks and even an iPad. It's great to have one spot for everything instead of on the seat or the floor. Received a discount.
B00D5ON726|5|Excellent
B000BZEHZ8|5|It about time some one makes things right for a change
B003ZWZ7VM|5|Perfect fit for my 2010 4-door Wrangler.
B0081ZXT7M|5|great
B00EE8K4XM|5|Excellent fit, Durable material, Unmatched Husky Customer Service.. What else do you want for something you put ur dirty shoes on..
B00GGQMBNQ|3|I think they are a good product that holds up the hood well ;the only thing that could be improved is the plastic clip that holds the support on the stud ; keeps coming off
B001G7WWDE|1|This is not the right wiper blade for a 1994 Previa
B0079GQKDE|5|After seeing someone use this at work, I had to get it
B0041CC9SY|3|I had to replace this as the portion inside the muffler has deteriorated quite a bit after only about 1500 miles.
B000COTT1U|5|Worked great to replace out air suspension in our Grand Marquis
B00JGCDE0G|5|Perfect fit!
B00R1FL2PE|5|Worked exactly like it should. Sounds a little different , but that is normal.
B001CI4MA8|3|shipped fast decent product
B00ES5QUJ8|5|EXCELLENT
B0013FMW84|1|not worth the money you pay for this crap
B008EU3MBW|5|Nice job, perfect for hard hat!
B00E5KISZK|4|Works well on the white sidewalls of my 27 pairs of Vans. I would recommend using a wet cloth before you spray though or you'll run out fast. I would like to see a bigger bottle but it certainly beats general purpose cleaners.
B005UZK77G|5|AWESOME... Gained 3mpg
B010FZZQDK|5|Nice product easy to install. Nice price very good quality.
B0009IBJE4|4|One smart little device, this is. When you disconnect the charging cable, it stops charging, thus preventing an accidental short circuit. When you hook it up and select a charging cycle, it ramps up the charging current gradually instead of suddenly delivering full current. I imagine that will extend its lifetime significantly.<br /><br />Two things I don't like about it. One, it's very noisy. Not a problem if you're using it in your driveway, but in my shop it's a distraction. And two, it doesn't deliver as much current as advertised. I put an ammeter on the charging cable and it never got above 6 amps. Maybe my battery wasn't quite &#34;dead&#34; enough. But I expected a full ten amps even if the battery is nearly charged.
B00EDFM3B2|5|So far, so good with these lights. In testing I figured I can run the 10 lights I purchased for about the same energy as 3 incandescent bulbs (based on when the fan kicks in on the converter). I've had them all running for about 30 minutes, then checked a few of them out. While warm, not dangerously hot. My wife and I think they may even be a bit brighter than the incandescent bulbs they're replacing. Maybe I'll get more battery life next time we boondock!  UPDATE: After camping a whole season with these bulbs I've replaced the rest of my incandescent bulbs with these. Only complaint I've had is what I've noticed others have complained about. When running lights close to the radio, they interfere with the reception. Since we usually have music playing from a phone, it's a minor inconvenience for us. Something to consider when you use them.
B0117YNYX2|1|The camera is blurry. I tried cleaning the lense but it's still fuzzy. I'm pretty disappointed.
B0031I20JC|3|Fit well.
B00D8JLME8|1|The tube should less than one star.  It leaked air the first time I used it.  I have changed a lot of tires, and never &#34;pinched&#34; any of them.  I pulled the tube had to buy  patch kit.  I glued a total of 6 patches on the leaks, and the tube still leaked.<br />I finally quit.<br />I would not recommend buying the tube, go to Home Depot or Lowes you can buy a better tube.
B004GDDEQO|1|Headlight didn't work.
B00595OM82|1|Poor quality, fakes
B0034NQBJO|5|The ride is so much smoother than before.  We should of got them a lot sooner<br />10 out of 10<br />The truck pulls a 8500 lbs trailer and the ride is amazing
B006B22Y9Q|4|Good product but its ridiculous that it doesn't come with instructions.  There are several ways that the different length bolts can be used.  Would save a lot of time for the installer.
B00KTHV10C|5|Works perfectly on my 2009 Honda Pilot.
B009OTK094|5|Has a nice smell and foams well in my foam gun. Does a good job with cleansing and should handle anything with the exception of heavy caked on dirt.
B004GCGJJY|5|It was a top of the line part.
B00TZ1EDN0|5|Perfect fit
B00FT69H72|4|Works good....slight modification of gas line
B00XK43P1E|4|I received this in the mail promptly.  The unit is flat for easy storage and comes in a 2 piece plastic storage case.  The unit is powered by either batteries or a cigarette lighter.  The  chord is long enough that I could plug it in the from to my truck and it could reach beyond the back of it although I probably would want to to put it on batteries and move it further up the road.  The legs swing out for making it easy to set up and very stable.<br /><br />Great product!
B0049Z8I3I|5|Just what the description says it is.
B00KGGTF9U|2|The quality is good, but eventhough I ordered the medium size, it doesn't stand well in my SUV. It is hard to keep it in place without falling. One size up would double up the price. I wish this would work. Disappointed!
B0006Q7H2W|5|Works well
B000C5453G|5|Still has a castle nut.
B0085O3VUE|5|High quality
B00DHUA9VA|5|G&eacute;nial, mieux que le gmos-01
B002QPIXJ2|5|awesome
B00AWYD7RC|5|Good stuff
B00KMR49EY|2|I bought this for my boyfriend as a present. When he went to install it he decided to hardwire it because he had a seven pin adapter not a flat four.  Everything was going great until he tested the reverse lights and they are so dull you can hardly tell they are on.
B00AULM494|4|All good....
B00AQ29GA2|1|Total JUNK<br /><br />These were junk, besides being junk arrived broken (so bad the cardboard box arrived in tact but the wheel covers were damaged) goes to show the quality. Plus even though they were listed to fit 2011 Prius they only fit a Prius with the black steel wheels....I've owned 4 prius and never seen one with steel wheels....maybe outside the USA? I buy ALOT of things on Amazon, our house is now a UNOFFICIAL UPS daily drop off, and I have never had such a run-around from a Amazon seller as I had with TuningPros on returning an item, and I mean worthless. Ended up having to file with Amazon to get a refund, nobody wanted me to return these cause the must know what junk they are, one good thing they are recyclable so that's where they went.
B00LOS93FA|1|It looks super cheaply made
B00WFJ3JZC|5|Good price for the bearing buddy caps
B0081S8OII|5|A OK
B00XZ78W3C|3|The roof rack fit good. We have a 2011 Rogue. I did have to tape the ends up from shipping accident.  It was easy to install, but it took time walking from one side to the other. The only problem we found was finding somewhere to store them.
B0089KMB9G|5|Worked great on 93 cadillac eldorado
B00GKEFNR0|5|Cuts the wind blast on my chest substantially riding my 2012 Triumph Street Triple R on the freeway -- less at 70 mph with the windscreen than at 50 mph without it. (I'm 5' 9&#34;.)  Straightforward to install with a 13 mm open-end for the bolt heads (top) and a 12 mm socket with a 2&#34; or 3&#34; extension bar for the nuts (bottom). Loosen the nuts a little first and then swivel the headlamp units outward to reach in and get just enough wrench on the bolt heads to keep them from twisting -- it's tight. When pulling the headlamp units away from their mounts in order to install the (slightly) longer bolts, be careful not to lose the serrated lock washers inserted between the headlamps and the mounting brackets that stop the headlamps from losing the proper alignment. (Don't ask!)
B00KTIYXLU|5|Great product. Fast shipping
B00KHL0EQM|5|Yes I bought these also.  They look great with everything else with bling!  Great quality product.  I would recommend them to everyone.<br />Andrea. South Beloit IL
B000CIPUR8|1|This stuff is snake oil, mumbo jumbo and plain useless.  It MAY work if your catalytic converters are just on the brink and the check engine light has just come on, but there is no way that it will &#34;clean&#34; cats that have been in bad shape for a long period of time.  If you really want to pass your emissions test the only sure method is to have the catalytic converters replaced.  The customers who say it works must have just been very lucky!
B00466V9AY|5|Came with batteries,Programming was fast and easy. 2 mins from the box to use. Looks exactly as the remote it was replaced. Priced at AutoZone for $49.99 paid $6.95 on Amazon.
B005IGRR3O|5|OEM.  Great look/feel/fit.  Heavy canvas.  Not the flimsy stuff!  Prompt shipping!  I would buy from this merchant again.
B0085XV9JA|1|Cheap & bad plastic
B00TH47R2O|5|Great part, great communication, great price, fast shipping
B0007M4MKA|5|Good good:)
B00GHT83YI|3|All buttons work a few months after install but the back right switch gets stuck and causes the window to stop working for 10 or so minutes of i dont catch it. I just have to make sure the button is not stuck afer i use it and it's fine.
B001TJZ6IC|5|Fit in car prefet. Easy to put in. Shipped fast.
B007SX5UL6|5|Seats fit perfectly...very pleased with product.
B00KTIR5UG|4|They work just fine, although the range isn't as good as the original was
B009IFICR6|2|The fit is good and the size is correct looking, but the four pegs are too large. Following the instructions nearly broke them off. Not sure what they are supposed to be, but the replacement parts pegs are substantially larger than the oem size on my car. I suppose you could file down or break off the pegs, but I drilled out my car's mounting holes with a 1/8&#34; drill bit and it snapped right in. I have a 2007 Accord EX.
B000X3EVY0|1|Supposed to fit 2008 BMW 328xi, but it is slightly different (smaller). The OEM pads are taller and cover more of the rotor surface. Returned it with no problem.
B00SVXKS7S|5|Nice very nice.
B00390BS7C|5|Thank you for offering this Powerbuilt Oxygen Sensor product which made our fix it project much easier on our 1995 Madza Miata.  Arrived very promptly.
B00AAR1BVA|5|A OK
B002EW5FWU|5|This just works. Period. Sprayed it onto my dry jeep, let it sit for a few minutes and the bugs practically fell off. Works great!
B0018KWVVW|5|Cover fits my 2015 Honda foreman ATV.
B000K022N8|5|Picture is not accurate but it fits on an 06 duramax
B000BUOSES|5|Works great!
B00X4S25L2|5|Ok
B005BRR2Q2|5|No one else has these and I feel unique! Love them!!!
B00DSIIQNO|5|They worked out good, would buy them again if I had to... they look really good on my bike..
B00JUQFVX6|5|The product seems well constructed and adds much needed organization to the back of my Forester's seat.
B00CNEQZHS|4|they work great and a good price
B00BYH6C1E|5|I bought it out of impulse of my new car, but I only realized how much it's been so dam useful until after I got it. Saved my phone from dropping multiple times, even precious French fries from falling in. lol. I always thank it for existing every time something was so close to going into the abyss.
B0006ZFRQG|4|I was able to raise my tool shed and level it, a weight of about 3500lbs. without any problems. It has a firm base and easy lifting action.
B00DUFC9QU|5|Fits great. Is well made. It is thicker than other car covers I've had, which is a plus. I live in CA and the sun burns the paint off people's cars. It's awful. This will help protect my paint.
B00LDNGRQO|4|Bulbs worked as advertised
B003Q2HI22|5|Excellent
B004JB0Q7I|2|Iit did not work for me
B002692308|5|everything was great. Perfect fit and easy to install.
B00MQ5Z5F2|5|Used for camping to charge cell phones. Charges them back up fast! Also used when we lost power
B004MTHH60|5|It did the job and save me money.
B0096O8XKA|5|These fixed a huge amount of rear bumping / jumping in my H2.<br />The vehicle doesn't lean as much & is more stable going in & out of turns.<br />I had no issues installing them & they fit without much work to get them into place.
B00VQO7LKQ|5|It's a great product, I've even got a new bike to go with the kit. The kit is better then those $150 motors that are out there. I suggest that everybody that's going to get a bike kit get this one.
B00D3937K0|5|Easy to install fit great
B0018EU3MM|3|Just got my 2nd remote from Scorpio.  The first one worked for a few weeks then would send the signal to the bike and arm/disarm, but the signal wasnt coming back to the remote.  So i never knew if the bike was safe or not unless i open the app in my smartphone and look to see whats armed.  Iv had my new one for 2 days and its doing the same thing.  The tech people are super friendly and understanding , but really all theyre going to do is keep sending me new remotes.
B001O10HTS|5|Toyota wants a  $400 . But I paid only  $38.99. Its work very good.
B00T8UY1JY|5|Fantastic lights, for the price. And that does not imply that they're cheaply made. These lights are the real deal. I love both sets I have. One on my F 250 and the other on my RzR 900.
B00W78DYVK|1|Not white.... more yellow
B0057GWP6Y|1|One day in sun and it warped.
B00AZPP0Y6|4|Very bright light for the price. I put it on my Jeep Wrangler smittybilt xrc bumper. Didn't quite fit right, but still managed to make it work.
B000HEBR3I|5|Works great
B006FXFXAS|5|Easy install. Looks great.
B00KX8XD6C|5|Easy installation
B00E1EQURI|5|Amazinnnnnng
B000PEZ1L4|5|Like it!
B005N53AM2|5|Been using this through 3 cars - other then the weird smell it first came with (like a garage) which wears away after a while, everything else is perfect. I love this steering wheel cover. Not too bulky. Doesn't get hot in the summer and protects your hands from a freezing cold steering wheel in the winter. Productive and cute!
B00CQH2YI6|5|Great
B000C3XDAE|5|Great
B00EAOIKVI|4|not as easy as the cheapie filters to install due the rigidity of the filter , had to disassemble the glove compartment to install in my 2013 pathfinder.
B0002JM8PY|5|It dries fast and holds well.
B000GZKXKG|5|Great
B00029WZGQ|5|Great product, I can see the difference in gas mileage!
B00YDNWF7G|5|This is a great helmet! It's smaller. It's so much lighter. The best part of the thing is its clasp. I never really read anything about that feature, but it is better than any that I've had. I haven't put my full fingered thickest riding gloves on, but I can tell it will be as easy to do as it is barehanded. The clasp closes in a series of clicks. I can click it down tight or leave a little looser. I haven't even adjusted the strap after taking it out of the box. I've been on three rides since. The sizing chart was dead on. I was in the middle of the large range and that is how it fits. Speaking of large heads, most of the biker nation must fall in the large range. That size was out of stock in two of the styles I wanted. I messaged the company through Amazon about their stock. The next morning, they replied. By lunch, they indicated that one style was in stock and they changed the status on Amazon. I bought the helmet that afternoon. Great product! Great service! Now for great rides!
B00V3JJXKA|5|Works great, just needed to get it programmed up to the Jeeps computer at the dealer.
B000GTVWMA|5|Strong - I put these on my KLR650.  I have big hands and there is no problem with clearance.
B00UAH8UZK|5|So far so good. Fit my 2014 cruse ltz looks good.
B00FWOKKGI|5|Súper
B00SYFIBWM|4|I installed the starter, but because of other work I have to complete ,the starter has not had a good test. i will try it soona soon . nd have a better answer
B00V9BI4FW|1|Save your money. These things are cheaply made. The aluminum is very thin as well as the rubber. They began to tear as soon as I started to put them on the throttle bar. The end caps are also poorly designed and look really cheap.
B000OGMXNM|5|These extensions give you an extra 3 inches of legroom , I'm 6&#34;2&#34; and its a lot better for me to stretch out a little .
B00IS9NBLA|5|My dad was very happy
B000GKAZVI|5|Product quality is great, looks like a 20 dollar item.  Unlike similar products in amazon this can go on with adhesive tape which is already installed on product.  Adhered to my rough cinder block garage walls easily!  Perfect!!
B008ECC6KI|4|suit what i needed
B001QFDVCC|5|they work awesome
B00VXFNIAU|5|Fits the 2015 VX Cruiser perfectly.  You MUST get the handle bars in first - then pull the cover for the rest.  Works great and a very tight fit.  Would not come off when towing.  Great product.
B00407NK6A|5|Good seal coat.  Worked perfectly.  Not as shiny as I would have liked, but I guess I ordered the wrong finish.
B003D3EZ84|5|well made heavy weight will last for years
B00L4TF32G|5|reasonable price , fast delivery.
B000CQPL5Q|5|Doing my brakes the first time it was really nice and easy
B00ANVI9P4|5|I love this top - just wish there were more options for BMW apparel for women.  Fits great and high quality.
B004OZR23A|5|Great hose and is easy to use and the color is light enough to see through
B005R4KUU4|5|Fast délivery, looks awesome.
B00F30EHVU|4|I put it on the window of my car. Be careful putting it on because you have to take it completely off to place it and you really get one good shot at it. Looks just as described.
B000X5MW0S|3|Overall a good replacement top.  I have issues with the zippers.  The driver's side door skin doesn't fit correctly and the window will not sip up completely.  Rear window does completely zip but not with ease.  Not sure if I would purchase this product again only because of the zipper issues.
B008BLFHS0|5|Wish it was a bit more yellow when the lights are lit up, but can't complain at this price.  Shipping was fast and the fog lights look good when off.<br /><br />One more thing, when I tried installing with soapy water, not all of it would stick.  So I reapplied it dry using a new section.
B00BITID38|4|Part received as advertised
B00ZZO01Z0|5|We replaced all of the overhead lights in our Class C RV with these lights, with some left over. Light is better than the old bulbs and we no longer worry about battery drain if lights are left on.
B00BC3SU4M|1|Can't stop it from buzzing, doesn't recharge. did the company ever test this before they put it on the market? how do I get my money back?
B003ZE6NW2|4|color looks orange in the picture but it's actually red, didnt match my jeep color but i'll use it elsewhere.
B0013FSWQU|1|These do not fit a 2002 Tahoe 5.3 as Amazon claims. I really wish I knew who to contact to have this changed.
B00T85ANNW|5|Item as described
B00JZQXJ3K|5|Easy install, great quality, even better price! Installed this on my 2015 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited. I removed my bumper to do this but you can tape or glue the nuts to the back of the hitch and avoid that. Mostly I just liked an excuse to crawl under the jeep and wrench on her. If you remove the bumper it takes 6 bolts and about 5 minutes, if you drink a beer halfway through. The wiring harness clipped nicely in the holes already drilled on the frame. Used it on a 500 mile trip this weekend coupled with the harbor freight aluminum hitch cargo carrier.
B007TYSQL0|5|Good quality. Actually took it apart (long story) and everything inside looks good also.
B004O844DS|4|Works well (but don't buy the cargo net that goes with it, it doesn't fit right). My only issue is that it takes a very long time to screw down the knobs because the bolts are very long...probably longer than they need to be.
B00FH7NSQ4|1|Didnt no there was only 2 and they dont fit right
B00MI2J734|5|Highly satisfied! They were exactly what I was expecting. Perfect fit and price.
B000C9LR24|5|Great oem replacement same as original part.
B00T6JHAK4|5|Love it!
B00SH1SN6C|3|I've used it a few times to start cars with weak batteries. The cover for the port where they jumper cables connect fell off and can't be re-attached, so that port is open and I fear there may be a shock or fire hazard since it would be very easy to short those two connections together accidentally.
B000EDUUG2|5|Perfect for a camper where there is not a lot of space. Great idea
B0050MX8MK|3|The quality and finish is good, but it needs to be about 1/4&#34; bigger all around. On mine, there is no way to install it without there being a gap somewhere between the edge of the headliner and the interior molding. Other than that it's fine.
B00P8AKYW6|1|It broke on installation.  Cheap metal.  I'm not a meat-fisted mechanic.  I've been doing my own auto work for over 40 years now, including brakes and exhaust and such, and I know what I'm doing.
B00AMPJ554|5|nice and sturdy.....fit perfectly
B004HO84U8|2|does not include clamps picture.
B000P0VT2I|4|Didn't work as well as I had hoped.
B006P89JYO|5|I like it. Shipped fast! Five stars
B00029WRK0|3|Pretty cheesy execution that will get the job done for cheap if that's what you want
B001OD2OCY|3|Wires could be longer, fits into cap very tightly. Fit could be better.
B004FFHJ14|5|Fits my 2015 Prius perfectly.  I can really tell a difference in how hot the vehicle gets.
B003ZYS8UW|4|fair price and works well.
B005EI7ZU6|5|Very happy. Excellent work!! Thanks!!
B008L4SXQU|3|does the job. still leaves a small gap at the top, and will probably break like the OEM does, but it's a cheap alternative. The finish is decent enough that I haven't bothered to paint it even on a silver xB.
B000VDSKP8|5|Keeps popping out when I open it. Quite annoying especially in traffic.  Turns out this is actually because of my helmet. This lens fits great.
B005EKY1EM|5|I have BatteryMINDers on two low-use vehicles and one airplane.  They work perfectly.  Batteries are always fresh even after 6 months of the vehicle being idle.  Also has kept my airplane batteries lasting longer than previously.<br />And the quick-disconnect plugs work very well.
B0013LAL90|4|A little small depth wise. Good overall look similar to the stock bags. They work. Need to treat the poly so the sun won't damage them like it did the stock bags.
B000NE7TJ8|1|It was suggested as the right door panel clip when I ordered new door handles for my suburban, these weren't even close.
B00FJDL0J8|5|Awesome stuff.  I have black trim on my rear bumper that I got wax on.  This stuff fixed that right up.  I have found that one application is not sufficient and doesn't last very long but as you continue to apply over time the durability gets better.  This also looks fantastic on my tires!
B00RW6CTEU|5|Very nice
B00BD5GVVI|5|Love them. They fit great!
B0041E6F46|5|Nice addition to for the classic Challenger look, fast shipping.
B000EDUTOA|5|great product
B0015Y5848|5|Well made and perfect fit. Highly recommend.
B0036E9VB6|4|Has worked fine for about 2 years. Though I have used it only about 6 times--that still beats the two Q Industries MV50 compressors I had. Each lasted only 2-4 uses! Keep in mind that you must be patient. It takes 2-4 minutes to bring a 16&#34; tire from about 20 psi to 35 psi. And, the built-in pressure gauge is NOT accurate.
B00GHT6SF4|5|the best and remained the same as the original excellent article
B00KSXX3BC|3|Worked... for a while. Not bad for the price though.
B00QFMGFGK|5|Looks good on the car
B006QZKF26|5|Everything good. Fast shiping arivied earlyer then writen
B00M0CBV9U|4|It's got the job done. But it's kind of a pain to use on the minivan with automatic doors.
B0023VDY98|4|well needed
B007V2DLGU|5|Perfect fit, and works as well as the one my father has had for two years. Thumbs up.
B0012WHBSO|1|Gauge never worked,registers over 100 psi on a tire that is only inflated to 35. Actual inflation is slow when it works at all.
B00VIBI0PW|4|easily installed ( minor alterations ) for use as a rear view camer on my tent trailer ( mirror replacement ) added a shround over camera and used some bullet connections to make camera and connections removeable when not in use  range is okay at around 20 feet even with obstructions
B007ZLOFO4|5|Work great and fit great.
B000GHYGHA|5|Thanks
B0084L0YR6|5|Excellent
B000WFARHE|3|First of all, there is no &#34;meter&#34; as described on the product page.  Secondly, there is no second green light on the interface as shown in the illustration and noted by several reviewers.  Apparently, Amazon has been unable to update the graphics in the two years since I first ordered one of these.<br /><br />Still, it works well enough that when I needed a second float charger, I ordered another one of these.  I just have to be sure to connect it first to the battery to see if the single red LED comes on (to verify proper connection) and then plug it into a 120v outlet.<br /><br />So,five stars for charging, one star for Amazon's inaccurate graphics and description, for an average of three stars.
B00MBRUYEM|5|Fit was prefect.  Oem parts. 20 min install on '15 forte5.  You will need a small screwdriver to install front set with wheels on.  I used an s shaped one.<br /><br />The look is nice and subtle cause my car is black.  No rain to test effectivness yet though.
B005MVB3S0|4|I like the unit and had already seen one in action before
B00G4AB4MS|4|Works very easily and secure. Love the ease of loading and unloading.
B005BHCEOW|5|Excellent overall quality and capacity. Was considering a KLR Top Case but went with this bag instead. I made the right choice. Highly recommend this product!
B00B51WV46|5|We Love It ! !  GREAT Price ! !
B003C01DJC|4|fitted it to my 4.0 wrangler engine to allow me to add an auxiliary gauge, works a treat, and comes in a pack of two.
B00MLO3S52|1|I received this winter neck wrap sample very quickly,  so that I could review it.<br />The neck wrap has several issues.  As s regular snow shoveler, I feel that the material is way to thin.  In single digit temperatures,  it won't protect from the wind.  While breathing in is easy,  breathing out is not.  Vents should be on both sides.<br />Lastly, the velcro closure is way to small, so it is not adjustable at all. It did not fit me or my husband, and couldn't be changed.
B0019I0K8E|5|I've been using Akebono Proact pads on all my vehicles for years...everything from my Avalanche to my Corvette.  They produce little to no dust, are extremely quite and perform very well (stopping power).
B007EQO48W|5|Perfect match.  This doesn't include the catch on the hood, just the latch assembly shown in the pictures.
B0001EXGZG|5|excellent
B005DMHYJ0|1|Do not buy this keychain! It has already broken after only using it for a month. And Amazon and seller won't replace it because it is right outside the 30 day return window.
B0095IDYR4|5|Just like OEM antenna.  Easy on. Looks fantastic becauae it looks original to my 2003 350Z.
B000CACMMM|5|great product have used it on several trips and works great freeing up lots of space in the car.
B004HE6UPO|5|BEST BUY
B00MJVEXF6|5|Just what we needed!  easy to replace
B00LF05KU4|1|Two of the four vent scents that I ordered were empty upon receipt of product
B00PCEG5OO|5|!!! DO NOT BUY THESE IF YOU HAVE A F150 SuperCrew. These are for the SuperCab. For the SuperCrew you want the 194975 part number.<br />Otherwise these are great. Easy to install and allow you to crack the windows during hot days even if it rains.
B00EQMII02|5|Good  price and great service.
B00WJ0A306|5|Great product fast shipping
B000E4PVBK|5|Arrived on time.  Perfect fit.
B000B68C0S|4|This is the second one of these I've installed on my truck. First one lasted about five years. It's a seamless fit with the OEM version. I have to figure they're identical although I can't say for sure. The lock lever on both the one's I've purchased would not work the door lock properly. I don't know if it's because the throw isn't long enough or because something inside is hanging up. I don't know if it's the Dorman door handle mechanism or the door itself. I've given up trying to figure it out. In fact, this truck has been nothing but trouble for 15 years. 2000 Chevy c/k2500 crew cab with 99,000 miles. Ten to fourteen mpg if I'm lucky. Crappy brakes. What haven't I replaced? And now the tranny is giving me problems. Bottom line: I'm glad the door lock doesn't work. I'm hoping someone comes along a steals the damn thing.
B00E9LLLJK|4|Fits perfectly!
B00P1ZQOCC|5|It's great for our old beater truck.  Already had a compliment on the sticker.  Definitely gets looks going down the road.
B0023VIMWC|4|As described
B003COQAFU|4|Good strong winch.  I've been using it for several years on a RZR900.  Have pulled numerous vehicle out of trouble (including once for myself).  Rope has held up well and motor has good power for what it's designed for (ATVs and UTVs).  Never use on a full size vehicle!  I took away one star because I had to repair the drum.  The weld on the side of the drum split causing the drum to drag and hang up the winch.  Not hard to repair, but it was caused by a poor manufacturing process.  Like most winches of this size it's pretty slow. All in all, a good winch for the price.
B00T9LR5TU|5|Love this stuff. Just don't put in on the inside of your car's glass.
B00CE3OWAU|5|Excellent inverter. Love the two outlets and 2 USB ports.
B008SCWXN4|4|Does what it says it's supposed to on a 2014 Subaru CrossTrek w/two sets of wheels.  It will read the IDs of whatever is currently stored in your car (one set) and store those.  Then, you either need to know or get the IDs of any other set and manually enter them via the software (not difficult)  or get somebody else to program any other set into the car for you the first time and then read/store those as a separate set in the software.  Definitely download the latest software from their website as what comes with it was already out-of-date.  Also, save a copy of the IDs that the software reads and stores someplace else since I don't trust that the software itself will still work reliably on whatever computer I'm using in ten years when I still own the car.  Hence, you might need to re-enter them somehow later.<br /><br />Seems like a lot to pay for such a simple tool, but I haven't found anything else that does the job for less, and it does work.
B00390TJX2|5|Love this product...........perfect for our jeep!
B002ZTM82W|5|Lots of warnings in other reviews about the bolt length. As long as you don't plan on using quick connect mounts for a sissy bar the bolts are just fine. If you do want to use your quick connects, you will need to go find some stainless bolts about an inch longer. You have to take the shock bolts out and reinstall them. That's a job that only and octopus can do alone without a jack, so either have help or be able to take some weight off the rear suspension when you install it.
B000KBE988|5|Shipped very fast,  looks great, and fit my 2005 Ram perfectly.  They're too expensive in my opinion, but they work great.
B00JGP8I1S|5|Excellent
B00JV4EY62|5|Best Product
B0066QVU0Q|5|Perfect on bmw e60 without &#34;stealership&#34; price!!
B00NURLDP6|1|too small
B00KMR3J7M|5|Ordered this as a gift for my boyfriend. Works great! Definitely a good buy!
B00UQTG0NG|5|This was an exact match for the original case. I just put in the electronics from the original remote and I was back in business. The shipment packaging was excellent, and it arrived on time.
B002TMW6TU|5|fantastic, as many have said these helmets run a little small, went to the local shop and tried one on, i usually wear a large but needed an extra large, fit and finish is excellent, sound deading is excellent for a open face helmet compares to many full face helmets, the sun sheild is great except it tends to ride on your nose, there are 3 adjustments for the sheild, it automatically goes to the number 2 position, then i backed it off to number 1 position, full down number 3 can be used by pushing release button and sliding the lever all the way forward, fit is great and ventilation is above average for really hot weather  , way better than 1/2 helmets and visibility is excellent- great product
B0013ERRSK|5|Dog is pleased
B003SYJFK6|5|fast receipt of my headlight!  Liked it so much, I bought another! Thank you!
B00WQODBIQ|1|Does not say I love Delray beach FL<br />It says I love Delray FL. Not happy<br />Have written but no reply
B00J52MUBG|4|Product was just as described. It worked just fine ,perfect match of car paint. I am very happy with the results.
B006CR451A|5|great
B0009JKI8G|4|They worked
B00HVHE5MY|5|Perfect fit for my chipped key 2008 Mitsubishi lancer
B00II99ORU|4|Only 1 bad bulb in lot, so far
B004YMRIC8|5|Great cleaning product for my car.
B00C0T37ZE|5|Fit perfectly, color matches, great price.
B00NROV7PS|5|Absolutley Amazing Bag! It is huge in the inside and has an amazing amount of utility because of the straps in the outside. I used it to deliver things for my job and so far the only thing I haven't been able to carry is a pizza. You will understand it you buy it. It is also very comfortable to wear for long periods of time. It is huge though. Like it you took a mini fridge and cut it in half, about that size. Roll too is super nice and is made really well. Doubt it will fall apart within the next 10 years. Hope this helps!
B00BFE3H6O|5|I was hesitant about buying a non-dealer replacement part, BUT boy was I wrong.  This replacement cupholder is way cheaper that the one the dealer sells and in my opinion way better that the original.  Would definetly recomend....A+++++++++++
B0019CZEWW|5|Worked as expected.
B00FC22PVS|5|I bought the Innovited 55W HID Kit with the 6000 bulbs for my wife's 2012 Toyota Prius.  I chose this kit over others because it had pretty stellar reviews for a good price; however, I did read a bunch of reviews where a ballast had failed within a year or so and I just hoped this wouldn't be the case for me.  The installation process was pretty straightforward if you are somewhat technically inclined.  After installation, the bulbs were extremely bright and had great color!  This is where my review plummets...  Sadly, I am one of the individuals who had a ballast begin to show signs of failure at 6 months (the driver side headlight would not always turn on) and now 8 months after purchase, the ballast is fully dead and I am left with only 1 working HID headlight.  Hopefully someone at Innovited will see my situation and make it right by sending out a replacement ballast.  After contacting Innovited, they were happy to ship out a replacement ballast, free of charge!  Thanks guys!
B000GZGUP8|5|So far so good.
B000FCEXGK|3|Not as high of quality as I was expecting, but fits nice.
B00V30J86I|5|Helpful and i recommend it to everyone , but BEFORE buy it, measure your car seats.
B0041U49FM|5|The clear lens turn signal lights and fender markers on my 2010 Rubicon were faded and looked pretty ugly. I ordered a complete set of amber lights to replace all of them. These came complete with new lights. The turn signals were easy installation and they look great!
B009D3HM8I|5|Perfect! The color matched and the packaging allows for easy, clean use. Absolutely no mess. This really exceeded our expectations.<br /><br />Guys, a bit of advice when using this: Take a lesson from your wife or girlfriend's nail polish technique and do not dab it on like you are caulking a wall. Dabbing it on will leave an uneven surface that can show up. Instead, use smooth strokes, layering as needed. This will leave a smoother, less noticeable surface.
B00ITET5CS|5|Bought this for my husband, who is a pilot at heart, for Father's Day!!! I was looking for something different but settled for this and he really loves it!!!
B00OYAFOLM|5|Fits perfect.  Enough room to move my head and the fit is comfortable.
B0023W50XK|4|works great
B00EPNFRFQ|5|Works just like it says
B00389R8KU|5|Work great! I just wish they were a little less pricey. But hey, you get what you pay for. I also really like the fact that these are re-usable, which helps me feel better about the price.
B0079ZDYXO|5|Great product, easy to install and looks brilliant I feel.  Arrived on time with no issues at all.
B0007UC8VC|4|perfect fit.
B00HJEJOAW|4|excellent quality. good buy
B001F72Y5G|4|works great with my 5th wheel parking in camp grounds and light weight . it would of been better if a rope came with it , but I guess you would be way over charged for a small piece of rope. I used a old rope I had laying around no big deal.
B00NJJ0NPG|5|All was good. Thanks You!
B004I12MXU|5|10min. Job to change out. Thank you.
B00QHZV7IQ|5|Great product so far.  I have used the camera for about a month now while hooking up my camper and boat.  Works exactly as advertised.  The camera is very easy to set up and use.  The picture on my smart phone is crystal clear.
B00OP85ZBC|4|It was all that it calmed to be. I have attached it to my rear window of my vehicle in memory of those who are being held as prisoners of war and for those who are unaccountable for as missing. It is a small way of letting those who have lost loved ones that they are being remembered.
B009DJSKPG|5|Easy application and seems to work fine on my 2003 Ford Taurus OHV 6 cylinder.
B00K74OYO2|5|Works very well for us. On long trips our sports car bucket sheets are uncomfortable.  This pillow helps make the seat more comfortable for me.
B00BUS07WM|1|Bought this for my 2008 Hyundai Santa Fe.<br /><br />I took it to a lock smith to have it programmed and it was the wrong remote.  The locksmith pointed out that mine has a small indicator light above the lock button.<br /><br />Waiting on a call back from the company to see how well they handle an exchange.
B001OMVCIC|5|Works great.
B00CIMSGSG|5|Exactly as described. Fast shipping, works great. Would purchase from seller again. Thank you!
B00TUHXFIS|5|Heavy, nice quality and size.  Better than I expected!
B0012TRB9Q|5|Arrived on time and was exactly as described.  Unfortunately, I needed six of the &#34;6&#34; decals.  Good news is that if you turn the &#34;9&#34; upside down it is identical to the &#34;6&#34;.  Very happy and saved lots of money versus buying these decals from the dealer
B000F1ZA3Q|4|Was a good fit for my 2005 Acura TL. Good quality for the price and much better than having to modify &#34;universal&#34; fitting floor mats. I would buy them again.
B00AFVCNGI|5|great
B00DCYH7N4|5|Great ..looks better than I hoped
B001U2DPUE|5|Works well, as advertized.
B004809YBE|5|good price!
B00UXX245I|5|Look great. Fit great. Easy to keep clean.
B005VLM8AI|1|I took it on my trip to Sequoia, CA and threw it in the garbage can.
B0097JKQ22|5|nice finish
B00PV37ZEA|5|My husband uses this in his car and really loves it. It has kept his car a lot less cluttered!
B00Y5O6Q1Y|5|Great item.
B0085FOFFI|4|Mirror covers did not fit 08 Chrysler 300
B000SL4A84|5|Having a nursing background, I was happy to see this kit.  Fairly complete kick for minor emergencies
B00JXW0S1M|5|It was just what I needed, when I needed it. It works and should be all that needs to be said, aside from Thanks.
B003EAOSME|5|Great product exactly as described. Arrived next day just like I requested and great customer service!
B00AN5SWX4|5|Good on time
B010LE59KU|5|I love it
B00HLK57MI|5|Everything you want in a budget helmet.  Waiting to try the air attachment.<br /><br />Pros:<br />I took the helmet out on the track for 24 hours of lemons, did a day and night time stint.  Never felt overheated, and it was humid!<br />Helmet is very light.<br />Good flat black paint, had a few scuffs from the pit, but thats my fault.<br />Came with antoher attachment if you don't have the air blower.<br />I have a small head, my hat size is a 7 and sometimes 6 3/4, this fits like a glove.<br />Hans Device Pre-drilled holes.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Wish I bought it sooner.
B005LDBD3E|5|Goes well! Love it. It's smooth, jus the way I like it.
B0074OHCOC|4|Not top of the line as windshield cleaners go but when it disappears (they always do) is less costly to replace.
B008Y5C8B2|5|I recently swapped out my factory exhaust for this system. Now my Kawasaki Ninja 650 sounds more like a sport bike than an old man weezing.<br /><br />The install was pretty easy. Old parts came off and the new ones went on.<br /><br />Also, it feels like the bike gets through the gears much more easily as I'm sure it's not as choked up. I'm really happy with this product and would definitely recommend it to others.
B00P2HRGPI|5|these are a must have item. basically stops any and all hood vibration that normally occurs with the stock hood latches. this are durable and well built. kind of wonky to install, but once you have them on they change your highway world.
B002Y2ZP6Q|5|Wow!!! I just received my jacket and oh my goodness am I ever pleased. This jacket is so underpriced for the quality it is unreal! Anyone debating on this jacket should definitely jump on the band wagon. I am a small to medium framed female. I ordered the small jacket and it fits like a glove as though it were made for me. I expect it will rise up some in the back while riding but that is to be expected with most jackets. Just get a sign or patch that says &#34;Honk for Crack&#34; and you'll be fine haha.   Details: First off this is 100% leather outer shell with a thin lining on the inside. The patches are all secured tightly and are of great quality. The drawstrings on the arms and sides seem to be of a leather texture, nicely braided. The zipper works well and does not catch. The collar folds down easily without any annoying ends sticking up. Last but not least there is one inside pocket on the right side. What more could you ask for. Perfect fit, Excellent quality, and superb workmanship!! You can't go wrong with this jacket. Love it!!  Update:  I have owned this jacket for quite a few months now and I still adore it. I have found that the braided sleeves tend to get hung up on things from time to time but it hasn't caused any damage to the jacket yet. The color of the leather is still nice and I have noticed that there is some added colors under the leather such as the folds of it , I have noticed a pinkish red color. I'm not sure what this is from but it makes it unique. I would still recommend this jacket .
B00KTJ3ZMW|4|good value
B0009IBJE4|5|Works as advertised no problems out of the package. Helped restore one of my batteries.
B000BYERBI|5|Direct fit replacement for factory nissan v6, runs great,expensive but worth it,won't have to do them again for another 100000
B00WMK6Z46|5|Awesome buy! They fit perfect in my new suv and will defiantly save my nice matts the wear and tare!
B00HZ870GM|4|Bought this to tune a 2008 Hummer H3 Alpha with the GM 5.3L V8.  It tuned beyond what I would have expected a smaller hand held unit to do.  87 octane tune is what I run on a daily basis and have see a tremendous increase in fuel economy.  The difference in drivability around town is excellent.  The combination of the tune with better shift points makes the vehicle more efficient.  In all honesty, the 87 tune is what the vehicle should have come with stock.  On a recent 550 mile road trip, I picked up an additional 30ish, maybe even more, miles to a tank of gas.  The performance tune is excellent, for this application it might almost have been a bit much for daily driving where open roads are not your normal.<br /><br />The only reason I gave 4 stars was because the description says tire size can be changed to re-calibrate the speedo, but that function was unavailable for this application.  In speaking with Superchips, that upgrade is now in que to be updated at some point.  Overall excellent equipment and would highly recommend to the average person looking to run a stock daily driving type of tune.
B004DJCS2M|4|Seems to work well and helped restore my little motor cycle battery!
B00KTJ23I4|5|Works just as described, programming instructions were included and easy to follow.
B00332GPRY|5|work well and look good
B00AJVLHIE|4|I installed 4 of these on my 12' Pelican Jon Boat for night fishing.  After the install they seem fairly bright but I would have loved a blinding LED light to illuminate the water below me. For the price they seem on point with what I would have expected. Out of the box they are simple to install and come with all of the hardware you would need. I wired them up with a waterproof switch and an in-line 5-amp fuse which connects to my marine 12v battery. Overall a good buy and I would recommend them as they are the most reasonably priced underwater LED light I found.
B00Y4GY2MS|5|Took a little bit to get to my house, but man it was worth the wait.  These are very nice for the money.  They look classic, and the double sided tape is grey so it doesn't stand out like a sore thumb on darker colors ( mine is hemi Orange). I will definitely purchase again if they come off or something.  What are you waiting for!!  Stop reading and add to cart!
B0009IK9E0|2|Very cheaply made and the head works loose.
B00IZFNJ6Y|4|12 volts is a good thing
B00EG1MTGW|5|very satisfied, thanks again
B00BFE6QQM|5|Glad I went through Amaxon.  Fast and price is better than dealership.
B00ASN0XNI|1|Before buying this battery, you should know that the terminals are recessed so hooking anything up to the fronts of them is not very feasible. Then to make it worse, the bolts dont actually screw into the battery, they go to a small plate that you have to situate just right inside of the terminal.  Save yourself the headache and pick a different battery.
B00JH5O4OW|5|I installed these on a 2010 Chevy 2500 4*4 Crew Cab.  There is no tire, frame or fender interference once installed.  These also washout really clean and easy even when caked with clay based mud.
B00D1CQVIY|5|Well manufactured electricly, good outdoor switch,(water proof), for the money, a good buy
B00PT18QAQ|5|Works well.  Good for truck-auto as well as low pressure apps.Swivel makes access easy.
B008CLNYPC|5|Mounted this on one of the inside bed rails in my Tacoma and it holds my 20L NATO cans like a boss.  The top strap even has the added bonus of blocking the lid from being opened while locked, not that it's impenetrable by any means, but it keeps the opportunists out which is good enough for me.<br /><br />Have bounced this around several times in the desert/mountains and have no complaints or concerns with how this gas can holder has held up.
B0045WBVUM|4|Works great for long rides.I rode from Cleveland to Chicago and back in one day and had no soreness
B000HAEPSG|5|Good quality
B00IJP5972|5|This is good stuff just what the TDI needs
B002IZDM50|5|Works great, delivered on time and as described. Thank You, Rick!
B000C7W28Y|5|Exact replacement.
B00B6CTKUM|2|the spoiler was perfect
B00G620ZVU|5|Husband loves these
B000CPCRI6|3|The paint seemed fine, BUT apparently my car has been repainted since coming out of the factory so it was the wrong color for me...<br />Warning: buy your spray-paint custom from a local store!!!!!!
B003GC74S0|4|exactly what we need for the camper sewer hose
B011D67O6W|4|They got the hard part right - good design, nice fit, good price.  A couple of minor details were missed; first no instructions were included.  I checked the APS website and didn't find instructions either, although I didn't look that hard.  You can figure it out, but with six brackets on two sides, and each side having one bracket different from the others, you have to go through a few combinations b/f you figure out the right way to do it when you're missing the instructions, which obviously takes a little time.  Secondly, the hardware was incorrect.  I had too many small washers, and not enough big ones.<br /><br />A little more QA and this could be a perfect nerf bar set.
B0009PUGCI|3|This holder is OK.  Just a little too thin for the price.
B0098WDL8E|4|the color will disappear in three months
B008VBRVSE|5|The picture I'm looking at right now writing this review is NOT the model I have but mine gives you the code number and tells you in plain english what the problem is, as defined by the code list. I love it.
B004AGBFH2|5|Excellent product.
B003BZLTME|5|Single layer padding. If needed to go around a tight bend, you'd have to make relief cuts. Spray cement + metal zipties, or easy liner + plastic zips for a temporary install. Be careful if using plastic zips, the will degrade in sun and heat, which means they won't hold the padding when you need it.
B00KQK1YS6|5|Fit works perfectly
B007KPUXVY|3|As advertised. Smoked lense. . . . That's about it
B001A3GU6Y|4|The cover fits over the instrument cluster and covers the hard bags of the Moto Guzzi 1400 California Custom. But salad, the handlebars were not covered.<br />Bought a size large - perhaps the extra large might accommodate my bike.
B008FC516I|5|This thing is very quiet but boy does it perform. Forgot about my previous 4-year-old pump which was really beginning to choke. This is also significantly cheaper.
B006CPMARS|5|I'm extremely happy with my purchase. I ordered it on July 23, and received it on August 5. The seller even contacted me via email to confirm make and year of vehicle, than shipped it that day. It only cost me $35.00 to have the dealer cut the key and program it. Sorry for those who had bad service, but I'm happy.
B00DZ355KE|5|Perfect fit!  I didn't realize my bike had such a small battery, and since I ordered it &#34;blind&#34;, I thought it was too small when it arrived. However, it is exactly the same as the OEM.  It even arrived with replacement screws.
B0066Q8A40|5|Great fit and finish. Large enough to secure a full-faced helmet.
B00FQ0ROZS|3|I have the same ones but in flush mount and those lights are much brighter when compared to these. The lights i received have a blue tint and are kinda unimpressive but for the price they are pretty good I wish they were whiter. The quality of the lights are decent quality.
B00F0WTOJQ|5|Awesome, easy to install and look great!
B00M2SYXN8|5|So far so good
B00ECWF96M|5|Real happy with running boards really nice for the price. Installed easy bolted right up to the truck. shipping was good came right a way first day of the shipping estimated date. Happy with the purchase.
B0042HBNZI|5|Worked great
B000EPP9OS|5|good perfec
B00029JMXA|5|love it! I get compliments all the time about it and get asked where i bought it from, and some questions if its real. (slaps forehead)
B004ZF39T0|5|Thanks! Awesome Product
B005FKA9G0|5|yes arrived in timely manner.. No issues with installation and price was perfect!
B0000AXDG4|1|I have bought 4 covers for 4 different vehicles and this company produces JUNK
B000OQMK58|5|Love it
B00KMR3GYI|5|Light is badass. Even dances when the hazards are on. If it came with addition mounting hardware it would be a 10. The sticky rape doesn't last too long in the extreme heat of arizona.
B00BXMRP4I|5|this pump helps to keep my car air going.
B002C7DSIK|5|We bought two of these to act as guard rail of sorts for the top bunk in our RV for our 2 year old daughter, we used coat hooks from Target to anchor the webbing to the bed area, she never felt insecure and we didn't have an issue with her or her things falling off the top bunk, it was a great solution for us.
B00JV2KCCY|5|Great!
B00B98TR2O|5|Exactly as described.
B00G620ZVU|5|Have not mounted as of yet but seem very bright and of good quality.
B0009N0W60|5|Great product!
B005TCCKDO|5|Nice gas door...looks great!!!
B0010G2BT6|5|It works just like the original before it broke. Excellent product.
B00J3D96RS|4|This dash mat fit great and looks great!
B00I4R25IG|4|clear and sticks well.
B00G665HEQ|1|It was the wrong part
B0002NYE5M|5|Best car cleaner  / wax I have ever used.
B008MISDH4|5|Use it in my 97 Yamaha Virago without any issues.
B000LU9QMM|5|great
B0083H5J8U|5|Still expensive for what it is in my opinion, but compared to the other options out there, great deal.  Worked well
B003PIBPKI|3|The hitch itself seems to be very well made and looks great. The problem I ran into was with the square metal piece that sits on top of the loop underneath the car. I had to grind the metal piece down a bit to get it to fit.  Other than that, it was pretty easy to install.
B005DF549E|4|They cover everything well but on the right side there should probably be another strap- as part of the cover going around the side has a wrinkle. It's not a big deal in all reality
B00KAV9EDS|5|Work very good
B00O2IQ7PI|5|**EDIT 11/17/15** After being contacted by the customer support team that sells this product, they PROMPTLY replaced my pair and within a couple of days I had a brand new set that lived up to the expectations created by everyone else writing excellent reviews for this pair of wipers. Now that's what I call awesome seller and wonderful customer service!  -- One thing that I would suggest if you're having issues with the blades is to check your wiper arms--you know, the metal part that actually attaches to the car. These can sometimes get bent or misshapen for a number of reasons. You can either try and bend it back to functionality or simply pick up another for your car.   Pretty disappointing after reading all of the overwhelmingly positive reviews for these blades, but either I got a faulty product or my car -- 2000 Volvo V40 -- is not completely compatible with them. When it's raining there's a triangular shaped area directly in the middle of my windshield that doesn't get wiped, even though the blades (the right one, specifically) run directly over it. For some reason, the blade stops being flush with the window right at that point, and I suppose it lifts up slightly for whatever purpose. This triangle is about 6&#34;x6&#34;x6&#34;. Additionally, unless it's raining hard enough, the blades drag across the windshield, causing them to jerkily skip across the surface. Ultimately I'll be replacing these ASAP. What a shame; I had such high hopes for these.
B000GZZ7T8|4|I ordered these pipes and got a message that the seller was out of stock about a week or so after payment. They offered to upgrade me to the 3&#34; pipes instead. I was OK with that. When I got them in they were black which was ok with me too. But the black coating comes off really easily. Over all the pipes look good and sound great. Install is easy.
B00I8OFS8O|5|Fit was perfect and shipping was right on schedule. Would highly recommend this product,
B00KJ8LJAS|5|Easy install, product as described. 2 weeks later one of the bulbs stopped working.
B00RMC00NG|2|Looked homemade not very detailed
B00HEZQHTM|5|Very good product, it is worth the money. Used on my diesel truck.
B0043OV0IA|5|I use to use my manual cable winch to lift my 5thwheel hitch set up in out of my truck.  I have only used this item twice but for me it is simple quick and safe.  There is no need to work about your fingers as with the cable winch and it seemed like it I was there for 10 minutes cranking it up or down with my cable now a few seconds up or down and you are done.  Great item.
B006C1NTEU|3|It is as I expected
B0034RZHHM|4|Works well. &#34;Brass&#34; wore off after a few months.
B004GCFJTK|5|For for the price I can't complain.fast shipping and it fix easily.
B001G6QCJK|5|WARNING: Does not work with Yellow Bulbs. My original socket is white and while this does fit it will not fit the yellow bulb. So Black socket has a different grooves.<br /><br /> I have a 2002 330ci with an M Package and the turn blinkers are yellow and clear glass housing. Other BMW E46's have Clear bulbs with Yellow housing.<br /><br /> It was a snap replacing however i will see if i can find a compatible yellow bulb otherwise will need to return unfortunately
B00514ABY0|5|Mounted on my 2014 Harley Switchback - goes on easily, fits perfectly and looks nice.  Havent had a chance to see how much it reduces heat.
B00G23UYAU|5|daughter loves them
B00192QBPQ|5|was very useful. I'm glad i bought the long hoses..
B000IG5PZQ|2|After about 3 years.  Didn't notice right away, but the clock is getting slower.  A new battery as well.  This also does not have a night light.
B000OQJFP6|4|good product from central tools
B00WJPGSD2|5|Out standing performance, well made and nice looking...  Apparent good quality....
B00E9APIMW|5|I love my Thor 2014 Spectrum Gloves. I originally purchased these to use on the race karting track, but ended up using them as my daily driving gloves for my car. The &#34;grip pads&#34; on the finger tips wore off over time, but I use the gloves way more than the typical user. They're not designed to be daily driver gloves. I eventually got a small rip in the left palm, but this was easily fixed with a small hand stitch with some black thread on the inside of the glove. Overall they're great fitting, comfortable gloves to be used on the track.
B00IO4EYMY|5|great service and product , I will buy again , thanks guys for your good service
B000HYL20G|5|Rubber pad + strong magnet + steel bowl = Parts Tray
B007AQH39S|5|Nice lightweight summer glove, seems like it runs a little small.
B00CQ6GWNU|5|much nicer design than other similar vests. longer fit and better looking, works too
B00GYH21FK|5|Thank you excellent
B005M1AVFQ|5|Great investment for any car owner and smartphone user.
B004QRX3RA|5|It was exactly what I needed. I would buy again.
B002MTTNZA|5|We are using the oil on a flat tappet NASCAR cup engine. Works great although pricy. Beats tearing the engine down...
B001KRYJDG|3|Good. Does what it should.
B00IER05ZG|2|Bought for my 2011 Dodge Challenger SE. Map lights look great but the overhead seat lights are not there. Disappointed. Please fix!
B00IICYTDG|5|Bought this to replace the screw that locks in my seat on my FLHTCU Harley Davidson. Fit perfectly. Nice chrome plating.
B00F9RNIPI|5|Fantastic set of booster cables. Nice soft easy to handle cables, powerful multiple lug type clamps, nice touch comes with clothe carry bag, work gloves and a battery post brush.
B0058J50LC|5|They look great. Good fit
B004SS8UUM|5|Good quality. Very sturdy. Not too long. I may purchase another. I use this lanyard for my work ID
B006HHRJFY|5|Exactly what I needed at a good price.
B005S2BKDQ|4|Not really any better than what you buy at the store.
B0068ERNNE|5|Lend to a friend he rode dry whole  the ride ...recommend..Big Rd
B002ZTK734|5|I put these on after a crash and took the stock mid controlls off. And I can't believe I didn't buy these sooner. Easy to install ( hardest part was persuading the exhaust to move out of the way a bit) and they feel very solid. The finish on them is tough... i accidently dropped them on concrete and there wasnt a scratch on them. plus, you really can't beat the price.
B00X5EO6VC|1|First unit that I had lasted using only 3 times. The second unit that I received didn't function at all.  Getting a refund.
B000C9UKYU|5|great price
B00PHQN3C4|5|I bought these on Amazon while visiting the USA. Installed them when I got home with led flasher from local shop in the front turn signals(buy a reliable led flasher). They are as bright as my head light when they flash. These are great for motorcycles as I can be seen better in the day time. The outer ring fell off one but is cosmetic makes no difference. I had bought other leds from local auto store and not as bright as these and one broke apart from trying to put it in.  I will move these to the tail light and will buy the switchback white/yellow for the front. I also have the 1156 waiting in the USA to install for the rear turn signals. (If you have a single dash light for turn signals you will need to add diodes or remove the dash bulb)
B000FW2NEY|5|great steering wheel cover!!! it feels and looks great on my toyota highlander!!!!  great price too!!
B0008G1NB6|4|worked good sure glad it fit on a ball mount they was no longer made  thanks....
B00U2CDJV8|5|This jumper pack rocks!  Must have for any vehicle glove box!  I put one in both of my trucks.
B0002SQZRC|5|Best wax I ever used on a black car.  Outshines everything else, including Pinnacle.  Put a section of any wax on, and then re-wax that area with Yellow wax and you will see the difference.
B000EVU8J8|5|it is super ok
B001KRH71W|5|Came quick and well pkged. Exact fit on my 1999 Jeep Wrangler Sahara manual with 4.0. Everything lined up and fit well, no drilling required.  Maybe 90 min job.
B00V5B3PTG|1|Mine arrived all scratched up. What a disappointment.
B00NKGEYWG|5|So cute. Went on with ease. It's been on my car for a few months now with no signs of peeling or cracking. I live in CA, so it gets a lot of sun.
B008MCGZ0M|5|Loved it..perfect fit been in 1 month now no problems.
B0039234WM|5|Forget Audi dealer prices ($50 for the set), these are the same or even better!
B000C2Q3SY|5|I had to trim and file the plastic guide tabs off on the sides of the screen end... (For my application 1991 K1500 5.0) This part number was recommended by a friend as it has a higher capacity flow rate. (he lives in Arizona and it worked for him.) In NC, USA it really woke up the AC!  My wife isn't complaining the air in the truck isn't cold as her car anymore....
B000C5A1JS|3|Bought two endlinks one deserves a five star rating because of how the hardware fit. The other deserves a one star because neither washer provided would fit over the threads of the endlink.
B00K5BDT8O|5|Super happy with delivery. Just found time to install this kit  on my in laws 03 super duty with help from my brother in law. Took us 5 and a half hours with two Jacks and 4 jack stands. Installing was a breeze and now truck looks killer!! Definitely recommend to all you modda f's
B000E4IGL2|4|Works well. easy to install and matches as OEM
B00QJM3G9A|1|Broke within an hour after instal!
B00ULNZMUY|3|Quality OK, but piece is misshapen.  Probably a copyright thing.
B00V4049K2|1|I have had this in my car for almost a month.  It is not eliminating the odor.  My VW has a crayon like odor which the mechanics at VW think is the type of grease used on the chassis.  The car is 11 years old.  I had to put a different, much less deodorizer in the car to mask the odor.  I have written to the company, but have not heard back from them.  I will return the product.  Did not work for me.
B0074JO6CI|5|Fit and worked perfectly on my 2008 JK
B00TQFXEVM|4|Bought for my wife's car. She loves it and has had several compliments on it. It's made of plastic and just snaps into the hitch receive but can not be locked. Easily taken off and hope it does not get stolen.
B0089RT4HG|5|Excellent.
B00NA8T15Y|5|Great Straps!! Husband took them over!!! He loves them! Great product!
B00X9VIK9K|3|Great for the price.
B002EODQ6A|5|Nice muffler gives your truck some sound but not too much does not emit any drone sounds in the cab. Very well built very sturdy
B00QMWQQ6W|4|They  don't grip as well as I'd like so they slide  out of  place at times but they look great  for the price.
B00029XHZ4|4|Works great but plays a little fast. Installation was easy
B005G7Y4Y0|5|Correct part and instructions shipped quickly.. Fair price paid
B004U3XQWC|5|Great product. Was easy to assemble and attach to car.
B006XG5EEM|5|Installed in '99 roadstar, looking good! Went with the matching 4-1/2&#34; passing lamps, very happy!
B011JLRSK8|5|I have used other dust collection systems. You know, the ones with two barrels on top of each other. This thing Rocks! The only thing I did not  like was the barrel top is a little flimsy . Its a little pricey but well worth the money. I will let you know how the filter purge works after i use it for some time.
B001LHVOVK|5|that's ok, a good piece, grand seller
B00VBN4LVO|5|My bike had faced several problems after i suffered a minor collision with a car but thanks to GOOFIT i have been able to bring it back to nice shape.I bought this brake pocket and installed it by myself without facing any difficulty.It has a good length on the oil pipe.I would like to recommend this seller he offers great products.
B0040CYWX0|4|OEM parts for the low, low gotta love it.
B0000DI81G|5|Dries very hard.  Great product.
B00QH2MKGC|5|Love it. I did need to removed one of the legs that was covering the licence plate sticker but with pliers and a little back and forth motion it came off cleanly without harming the rest of the frame. Installed you don't even notice the missing leg. 6 months later it still looks like new.
B004BFUS52|5|Just like adams detail
B00COYNZJ8|2|I do not understand how this has a 4 star average.  I am glad I waited until the price went down.  The image is quite dark.  Its hard to see what the picture is.  Two stars for the novelty, and it is doing it's job of blocking the sun from getting to my dash.  I'd rather pay three times as much for a quality one.
B00L9H5ISW|5|Perfect match.Thank you.
B004GFS2C8|4|It reinforced the blemish by filling the crack caused by a stone that had chipped our windshield.  The minor surface indentation was not completely filled after removing the surface sealant with the razor blade, but the repair is much less noticeable.  Be sure to allow vacuum (suction) step created by locking the syringe to remain for at least the recommended 10 minutes to draw out any air in the crack to be withdrawn; I noticed with air bubbles being created during this step.
B001UGJPXQ|3|Not tall enough to reach our POP OUT, so we install it under the frame, Could use a better strap, with an easier release. Price is better than at the Camping Stores.
B000BNOIB8|5|Very nice cover & installed easily on my 2015 3500 Ram. It is everything as advertised. Great seller- shipped quicker than promised.
B00PQ7Z0BQ|5|Having three grandkids who love to hide my keys (I hope not intentionally), I was looking for something to put on my key rings to make them easy to find.  I put these on my main key ring and had to use it the next day thanks to my granddaughter.  It worked perfectly and I am now using all four fobs on various key rings.  I couldn't be happier with this purchase.
B00O956VM8|4|Good price, the socket wasn't the size of my lights. I had to screw my bulbs into my lights, but they are working.
B0045G09TC|3|Good Lord this is one stout chain! Much bigger than I anticipated. Big enough to chain Cujo to the back porch.
B00267SQVK|2|I'm very sad.  My cooler has died.  It worked great for a handful of road trips for about a year.  But now it no longer cools :-{  I loved it, until I didn't.
B000KITSMI|2|This won't fit a 2008 F350, the tool is too small.  Amazon did a horrible job describing this tool.  Had to buy it and see if it would work.  It didn't fit my truck, so they got it back.  Everything seemed to work on it, though.  The valve handle turned, so I'm sure it sealed.  Just not for my pickup.
B000C2WDTW|5|Perfect fit.
B00AUKDTNK|5|great find!
B000KITSMI|5|It works.
B000EQQ5MC|5|Dealer wanted 160 plus tax I paid 40 after expedited shipping so I could get this done. The mount was nice and solid very much like the Honda one. The threads where clean and the holes lined up with out any issues if I have any problems I will update but for now I'm happy.
B00G24AGDY|5|Came earlier than expected, looks great on car.
B003NBFKDK|5|Good and stout.
B000COD56U|5|Installed these in a double DIN for my sxs. They all work great, but do get a little warm after a few hours of continuous use.
B001CA2JYM|5|Perfect fit...stiffened up the front handling a lot!
B00GSAUHB8|5|Easy to use and does the job well.
B002OPXAJ2|5|Great
B00J0D7IDU|5|awesome. heavy duty!. Takes a little doing to install.
B009FUF6DM|5|GREAT DEAL
B00VSQ5UIM|3|I got this for my 2012 VW Jetta and I works just fine.  I still recommend that you spend the money on VAGCOM if you are looking to fully inspect your car.  This item does not give nearly the readout as I wanted but it's reasonable for the price.  If all you are looking to do is reset a codes like your oil light, this guy will get the job done.
B004BHQMN2|5|just what I wanted - car looks way better since I put this on!
B0087XOTWW|3|Nice light, but way to Blue for me, should have got something warming, 4000 or 5000 ??
B00LPQMDTE|5|Good quality, bolted right up. Fast delivery. Very satisfied.
B00BCRMA9Y|3|Pretty good that it comes with all these things but it isn't as accurate for a Honda Civic. My steering wheel is smaller than the cover they provided.
B000182EXM|5|They worked good
B00Y1HQ45I|5|Worked great for my 2011 ford f350 .Had to take to a locksmith. He said it was that year of truck but ford wanted a lot for one key. So happy with two new keys for about  60 bucks less
B003GD4FP4|5|Good quality
B00MVN7692|4|These are well made and have held up well in an outdoor application here in Arizona. I have had them for about 4 months and they perform flawlessly. My only gripe is the diameter of this switch was slightly larger than the old toggles they replaced. I used a step-up drill to enlarge the hole for installation. I am impressed by the quality and durability. They are much more aesthetically pleasing than the original toggle switches that they replaced.
B00CQ6CAMW|5|excelent
B008FQRQBM|5|This worked perfectly with the Thetford porta potti. It helped keep it perfectly steady on our pontoon.  Works great!!
B0016KH20E|5|I have only used it once so far, but it is exactly as described. Pair it with a Reese receiver so that it sits nicely into the hexagonal grooves and you only need 1 wrench to fasten it to your receiver.
B000C9JAGE|5|This part fixed my cars issue of only blowing air on level 4 or 5.  Not my air blows on levels 1-5 as it should.  Pain in the butt to install on a 2003 Pontiac Grand Am, and probably most GM cars, but it can be done by a DIY person.
B000PRYDF6|3|You get what you pay for... Not totally impressed. Works OK if you don't need a socket set very often!
B00M2PS1RA|5|Compact enough to hide the little storage compartment underneath my trunk! It may not be the most powerful portable air pump. However, it just needs more time to do the job.
B00KVVBEWQ|4|I purchased the RV9490T directly from Magellan in March. The various features are truely ahead of its competitors including free maps, WiFI which allows regular syncing to various POI's and road conditions as you travel...But the unit had problems finding satellites which forced me to send it back. They promply sent me another unit, which for a week worked great. Then as I was preparing for a trip, the new unit failed to start..Kept indicating &#34;Loading please wait&#34; then &#34;re-loading please wait&#34;..then repeated this ...never started. I called to express my concern and asked for them to pay my shipping this time...They were to call back but never did...  I paid for the shipping again and sent this unit back...At this time, I am waiting for my third RV9490T to be sent.to me...If this works as advertized, I would give them a much higher rating...The customer service is ok if you are good at chating with a keyboard...They seem to be trained for canned responses for every concern..but at least they gave me return authorization codes when they realized the units were obviously defective...I'll update later after I receive the third RV9490T GPS... I am currently using my 4th replacement. The others failed for a variety of problems. This latest unit works just as advertized...One weak link is the ability to back up/restore the gps maps and software. That is because when you do a map download if anything interrupts the download, the gps will no longer function untill you repair the corrupted files and then retry. Fortunately microsoft notices the corrupted files when you connect with the USB port and gives you an option to correct the problem. The download must go to completion and be prepared to wait sometimes over an hour. All other features including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, content updates based on current location, satellite signals,etc.  now all work very well. I would give it 5 stars if it would correct the download issues...One other about magellan, They quickly replaced several faulty units..You just have to be prepared to pay shipping to return them.
B001RB87BK|5|I forgot about just how much I love Radiohead until I see this sticker and it reminds me.
B0031I2SPS|5|An outstanding value in a high quality rotor.  Identical to the OE in ventilation fin count and weight (mass).  Surface finish was superb.  Came packaged in plastic and inside individual AC Delco box.  Highly recommend.
B0043YIFGU|5|This pump is perfect for replacing transmission fluid.  My fluid was spent and she is shifting much better after the fluid change.  5 stars
B000C9PZHM|1|These did not fit a 2002 Tahoe 5.3 as claimed!! Be careful when you order. After figuring out these didn't fit I pulled all the O2 sensors and ordered the specific part number that was on them.
B00BFE2S2I|5|Fit
B0066T9OI8|5|Perfect fit for my 05 S60 R.
B000OXHNYE|5|Looks great, was easy to install.
B000EQD520|5|Perfect fit for my 2003 Silverado.
B000GU3WA4|5|This Switch worked exactly as it was suposed to. The harnes was plug and play without any difficulty. THe cock feature does not do anything, but I really didnt expect it to because there is no alarm and no physical lock to keep the handle bars from turning.
B000E6710C|5|Excelent and more cheap, good seller
B008AJPMRY|5|Well made, easy to install.
B00HLO49ZK|5|arrived on time exactly as described placed in 2nd car for emergencies
B00XV4Y3LE|5|Great product. Fast shipping
B0079MFD36|5|Match is perfect and the price was right! Very pleased!!
B00GSAUHB8|4|Works as expected.
B00HESFIJ4|5|Works well and matches the accuracy of my ViAir pumps.
B0027URE1O|3|the winch mounted perfectly, but the front pulleys don't mount straight to the holes provided. I bought the support to avoid making alterations to make the winch fit. In the end it still required alterations to mount the badlands 2500 winch. Overall i am happy with the purchase.
B004IARN26|4|This was a nice kit and it install nicely... except the front mounts.  On a 2001 Ford Explorer Sport the front mounts have a oval recessed hole that the bushing fits into.  this kit only has the circular lip on it for the from.  Since the front bushings weren't bad and only the others were, I just changed the bottom portion of the mount.  Just beware that if you are trying to replace the front bushings on this particular vehicle then you might run into this same problem.<br />All the others fit as expected and fixed the rotten bushing problem that  plagued this vehicle.
B00PBAK34C|3|Quality seems to equal price.
B004GJ8LW0|4|It's a nice bike..I got 1 with a plastic gas tank had a crack in it but I got it replaced for 20$ these r pretty fast lil bikes
B00Q74MMIG|5|Good thanks!
B0030G52J0|5|STOPPED THE LEAK.
B00SH1SN6C|5|I will make this review as short as I can because I don't like typing. I have a 2005 Scion Xb. It has a 1500cc engine (smallish). I received the jump starter, and it had 3 of the 4 battery LEDs lit out of the box. I charged my iPhone and earpiece all day, and it dropped to 2 bars. The next thing that I did is not recommended. I disconnected my main battery completely, and hooked up the jump starter by itself. I then started my car with the jump starter by itself. Honestly, it started like it had the regular battery hooked up. I was amazed. I know that most cars have larger engines than mine, but you can see that this thing really works, epically if your car battery still has a partial charge. Remember that I only had 50% charge on the jump starter and no other battery. Fully charged jump starter should work better on larger engine.
B000FRLO9Y|4|I have multiple copies of CTEK chargers and like them.
B00FZFLUVS|5|This product was perfect.  Just as described and installation went on without a hitch.  It would be great if it included the TSB that I had to Google.
B0030G861G|5|STOPPED THE LEAK.
B001NZO4KI|2|This was supposed to fit my 2009 Ford Escape.  When I opened the package, the bracket that holds the Transmission Cooler tubes was bent and the small aluminum bracket that is supposed to hold the tubes to the larger bracket was not even touching the tubes and bent at a strange angle.  I managed to bend the large bracket back into a position that worked only to find that the transmission cooler tubes were smaller than the stock tubes and the clamps on the hoses would simply not clamp down and make a seal.  I replaced those stock clamps (on the hoses) with some screw type hose clamps and that seemed to do the trick.<br /><br />Also, please note that this does not come with new seals that go between the AC connector and the condenser body.<br /><br />I would have sent this back but had my car torn apart and was committed.
B0071I36IW|5|It worked
B002MQAWOY|5|Great!
B00AZJYDQI|4|Rock solid in line air chuck.  Need to play with it to get it to work w/o leaking.
B000GGZPMG|5|Great!
B007B3UETQ|5|I put this on the back of my F150 and it sticks rather quickly. I've had it for close to 2 months now and have had no issues with fading or peeling up. Great product :)
B000CO7DZ4|1|Does not fit flush to the front bumper of a 2010 Jeep JK (Wrangler) due to fog lights...it's close, but not universal.
B000KOVY5G|5|Just as expected
B0049TVI1I|4|works a treat but would be better if the wires were colour coded, now have all the fan speeds on my Wrangler TJ
B001AWLTX4|5|I love this. I wear it very frequently
B003LMGDHI|5|This followed by m205 is the best combination bar none
B00KTJ9V16|5|Good product and delivered as promised
B007N32BCM|5|exactly what wanted and described. delivered earlier than expected. welded on trailer and quite strong.
B007GMQG1W|1|This doesnot fit my Camry 2015 perfectly. Anyway it protects me from the heat compared to before.
B00NWT07SQ|5|Fit right in will see how stands up over time , easy fix for broken . shipped quickly
B00S19924W|3|Did not stick at all. Had to glue them on
B00303JKT6|5|Worked as expected
B000HS6XJW|5|Fit perfectly.
B000C822PQ|4|Seems to be working fine so far.  Must be working very well and air tight because its really hard to remove when filling up because of the vacuum  that it maintains.
B0040MX13C|5|I like it.
B0002MA9WA|5|Just the right width for a 2 X 12. Came with top and bottom for two ramps. Nice and sturdy.
B00FZWODF6|5|Looks great, fit perfectly.
B00HDIHIBG|5|work perfectly
B000IXUCSE|5|My husband loves this steering wheel cover so much that when we bought a new car on the way home he told me I needed to order him a new one for the new car since he didnt want to take the one out of the old car since we were keeping them both. Luckily I ordered it on Amazon and could just look at my order history and order it again. This is a great steering wheel cover that has fit in both of our cars perfectly and have never given us any trouble. Plus its Taz, how can you go wrong with Taz?!
B002HXSAJ6|5|excellent
B0087DQKY2|5|hold up nice I put it on my yeti cooler
B00N5BAWYK|4|Nice and bright!
B004IYY8SY|5|as advertised
B00JRE38EA|2|Already wrote an earlier review. Update that one bulb at the license plate doesn't stay on due to the poor design of the connecting wires at the base of the bulb. They are just bent over the base unlike the OEM bulbs that came on the vehicle which are I'm bedded in the glass base. Other than that they burn bright. I just have to get back under the rear bumper and fiddle with it or replace it with another new bulb from the 10 bulb packet.
B000GV9NYW|5|Great pipes. Easy install.  sounds good, looks good.
B0027UTJHQ|5|fast install and ready with all mounts and hardware
B000BPOIBQ|1|I HAVE A 92 BRONCO 5.8 PURCHASED 8 PLUGS AND HAD THEM INSTALLED 3 OUT OF THE 8 WERE DEAD REPLACED WITH BOSCH PLATINUM + 4 TRUCK RUNS GREAT STAY AWAY FROM E 3'S
B00J0ABRL2|1|Junk, and terrible customer service. Used the 5/8 lock with my camper and the lock BENT very badly. I don't feel safe using it. Talked to the CEO and he blamed it on me for using his stainless steel pin with an equalizer hitch. Really?  I'd bet more than half of all customers that use Trimax receiver locks are using them with campers and equalizer hitches!  And blaming your customers for what is obviously a design flaw. Junk, don't waste your time.
B000CSNK8E|5|this was easy to install and looks great on truck.
B0079SJ0B6|3|Lighting medium power
B0043S0T0G|5|Just what we needed, and half the price of our local mobile home parts store. Arrived very quickly. I would recommend.
B001539B7O|4|No problem
B00RK27WIE|5|I used these on another machine. I purchased this set for a 86 honda atc 200x. these are of good quality. Delivered on time and as are described.
B00DO7FKJW|5|Works perfectly, just what I needed.
B002UC6SAC|5|Used this as a guide for a barn-style door in the basement.  Works very well and, since the door is painted white, is barely noticeable.
B001RM7VSY|5|Work great!  Everything I needed for my 96 Ford Ranger
B001LL9UQ2|5|It is performing as expected. No problems. Easy to use.
B004XXRLDO|4|Could use a &#34;stop&#34; at the base. The laptop slides off .  Otherwise great product for a great price!
B00DE3XIYA|2|I ordered this for my husband back in February/March. It's completely falling apart. The steering wheel covers vinyl just peeled right off. The embroidered Dragon is the only thing still there. The seat covers have done the same. The vinyl just snags and peels right off. They looked great when they arrived and we're delivered promptly but I wouldn't order this again.
B001EAQTRI|5|Like magic, I no longer hear a high pitched whine from my cars engine through my aux input in my car while charging my phone.
B004INCV5C|5|Perfect fit for my 2013 Sierra Denali 2500hd!
B002MY6ZZG|4|Pain in the ass to get your cable through but once it is, it works great.
B00GMT4G0S|5|My only warning is that these have no traction on leather seats. I had to find a rubber liner to put on the seat first so that I won't slide around when getting in/out of the car.<br /><br />Otherwise, I love them. No complaints on the quality, fabric, or anything else.
B00KTIQAZW|5|Came quick & works great, just didn't get the green cover with it.
B00F3LJAMA|5|Matched my car interior and great grip! I love it!
B00BYH6C1E|5|Perfect
B004GCO5AO|5|Great fit. Exactly what I wanted. Thanks!
B00C8A2WZG|5|I purchased these for my 2015 Honda Accord Sport. Good quality and perfect fit.
B004OFLBSW|4|I have Ford Focus and these say they are jumbo size but they aren't as big as my last pair and if you don't get them in just right they fall right down. Not quite big enough. A hassle if you're in a hurry, and I always am.
B000S2S3CM|5|This &#34;OE&#34; brake line matched up to my 2003 Chevy Silverado V6 2D LWB Work Truck. There's a slight difference from the production line installed hose and this OE hose, which is the steel line that connects to the banjo doesn't have as much of a bend in it where it conforms around the brake caliper. This doesn't complicate anything, it just reduces the clearance between the line and caliper. So if you compare the hoses, it might seem it might not fit properly, but in my case, it did.<br />My only dislike about the brake line is the included copper washers. Would have preferred steel.
B00YWGSIXE|3|All things being equal, you always get what you pay for. These assemblies are somewhat less expensive than others, but I find them to be somewhat inferior in quality, too. The fit is not perfect and left a gap above the headlights on my 2003 (Gen1) Dodge Durango. The assembly also is light and feels &#34;cheap&#34;. The headlights do not come set from the factory so expect to have to adjust them to have the correct projection.
B00MCA4MDM|5|Fit perfectly looks great like a brand new bike
B00BLX1L4O|5|Great item.
B0034ZNY10|5|I have only used this a few times since receiving it yesterday. I works great. I have a new car and I picks up well. If your car is really dirty clean it well and use a hand  held like this to keep it clean. No handheld is going to replace a corded or car wash vacuume but this one is way better that I though. Give it a try you will be impressed, I was.
B007N6POIC|5|Good fit.  I pried off the heat exchange (?) components because I don't use them.  I could have done without the heat riser outlets as well, but I had the block off plates. I ran the muffler for awhile, until the heat burned off most of the paint. I pulled them off and used hi-temp paint to refinish.
B00HQETDWO|5|It is working out great for our needs.
B00O2IQ712|5|I love these wipers! They are SO QUIET. I will get this brand again and again!!!
B0002UHVIW|5|Very easy to install product is wonderful
B00HXC3R5S|3|Great looking seat, comfortable and grippy.  Though there were some finish issues with the seat I received.  The covering under the seat was/is peeling away at the edges and the yellow glue is visible.<br />Good thing I am mechanically inclined and creative or I would've had to return the seat.<br />The bracket provided to install the seat comes in a separate baggy in the box, no big deal, remove a screw on the bottom of the seat and thread in the bracket which has an attached mounting stud for fastening to the bottom of the seat. It is a Y shaped bracket with two holes to mount on the studs on top of the rear fender.  The problem is when you screw the bracket to the bottom of the seat, the bracket is flush up against the seat bottom not allowing room for the nuts to be threaded on the studs. Very frustrating.  A seat purchased from HD would have fit right the first time and installed in 5 min., however would have cost another $150.<br />The mod I had to do was to buy a barrel nut, 1/4 threaded stock and block rubber from my local Ace Hardware.  Yes, Ace is the place!  I made it happen by creating space between the bracket and the seat to allow for seat removal and installation.  Then I added the rubber to fill that space so the stud doesn't snap, also ensured the bottom of the bracket had enough rubber to rest on the fender.  I hope I explained it well enough to all to understand, I usually need pictures.  Sorry didn't take any during the process.<br />I rated the seat 3 stars due to the time, blood, sweat and tears it took to install it.  I have a couple hundred miles on the seat, all is good.
B000HEAGQM|5|great service quality part
B00404ZDAO|5|Love it!
B006HHFSIO|5|Good quality look good
B0030IW2MI|5|good
B00P73KWE4|3|I still have not determined the best way to put it on my rack [Honda Rancher 2005].  The directions are not very clear.
B005HAYDR4|5|love this product
B000IYIUD2|5|Just what we needed, was told by ford nz, this part is obsolete, saved us quite a bit of $$
B007MJCCU8|5|Great helmet. Great ventilation a bit heavy
B001F79API|5|Perfect fast shipping great price
B000C9U216|5|Love it
B00ANZHG7C|5|Great cleaning product for my car.
B0016I8E1M|5|Perfect for my jeep even on the Colorado 4 wheel roads- can open the hatch no problem.  The raised hitch bar gives lots of clearance
B00ORNEQBA|4|Not bad, I can also use it for other jobs aroung the pad.
B00M90THOY|5|It is a great product and looks perfect it was just a little to small for my car...
B001BFRQD2|5|works perfectly in my 2000 Wrangler
B0085Y8UMI|5|perfect!
B00F66VWNW|5|Product delivered as described.
B004MUGBJS|5|the product works great actually works better than the old one when it was new , Thank You.
B00KTJ9MQ0|4|Worked flawlessly - Got them programmed in about five minutes. Saved me over $100.
B00NIGN52S|4|Fits like a glove and works well
B008K6I1RU|5|couldn't find a better place to sit (-:
B00GSAUHB8|4|The product serves purpose.
B00FY80KOY|5|Perfect for my '02 Mazda P5. I replaced all three solenoid valves (PRC, VTCS, VICS) with this part and it cleared up my to CEL codes p1569 (vtcs) and p1250 (prc). I'd definitely recommend this part since they range about $70 in price from an auto store. It's also very simple to replace.
B0008D6NK0|5|I own a two (2) Laser device just like this single one.  This was a gift and works correctly.  Buy it!
B0083J7K6M|4|I fixed the issue I had with my mirrors and it looks great!
B003VASS00|5|Well built, exactly as described - served the purpose I intended it for
B000C9SR90|5|Fits and was an easy install for any do it your self kinda guy. Also made my truck run smoother so thats an added bonus.
B00B7OX13Q|1|Scratch easy and the paint go out. No good.
B001NAQT2Y|5|dude I didn't think it would of helped that much but dammm lol
B00EI6EEJK|5|Excelent!
B005ZFAIIE|5|it was perfect..
B004BTAJ2A|3|Nice but kind of smelly can't get rid of that rubber toxic smell
B00N2K6M2A|1|Wouldn't connect to my vehicle or any other one I tried it on.
B005OJ3RSO|5|Looks great!
B00I9XH1NO|1|Windows software recognized the scanner but was unable to communicate with it. Tried different software, USB ports even two different laptops but still no luck. There are a lot of similar products sold on Amazon (Wifi, Bluetooth or USB interfaces) and lots of people got the same problem. If you're looking for a USB interface OBD II scanner, go with ScanTool OBDLink SX. It's slightly more expensive (around $30) but it's totally worth it. Better quality cable, nice bundled software plus three years of warranty.
B0082365AQ|4|As everyone else notes, the new tires are a bit smelly . . . but the smell is not particularly offensive (in the garage). Everything else about this cart is splendid. Light, easy to use, compact, sturdy. Really perfect for its task!
B008L5J5G6|5|Part was easy to install and better than Original
B00K1LKPNU|5|Great product. Easy install. Delivered promptly.
B00ENX0MSK|1|Leaking. 0 miles on the build.  BLEW UP ON THE DYNO!!
B00029WRJQ|4|These mirrors are a little hard to adjust, but they did a satisfactory job.
B00FAJOZTS|1|We bought these 2 years ago for 2 full dressers.  You still have to tie down the front of the bike or they come out of the chocks.  Damage to both of our bikes.
B011EQLLEC|5|Worked Perfect!!! Thank you !!!!
B00KZ3201O|4|Like its small size cord length is good, Nice product but poorly marked, couldn't find P/N or serial numbers on it.
B00ANA3UTK|1|I purchased this product to remove a tar like grease on my car seats and side panels. Even after letting it soak and using a tooth brush, it did not remove the tar. I then used a different brand natural ingredient tar remover and this worked very well. Do not recommend for anything other than cleaning dirt off of surfaces.
B004P3TNDI|5|High quality, cast metal.  Looks and feels identical to the original.
B000V9ATEW|5|Fit perfect exact match to the one I replaced. Got it on time.
B00AT9AX72|5|worked great quick shipment
B00L81X6OM|4|Look good and collect a lot of debris.  backs could be a little bigger, but the dogs don't mind
B00IZ3BUEE|5|Awesome
B001CVXW1K|4|It fogs up when I walk but works well when I bicycle
B00OTRQG8A|4|I'm very satisfied with the bag. The quality is good, and it look's good on my harley. Delivery was on time.
B004K9EXDM|1|Does not fit perfectly.
B005JU5VH8|1|I put these on my 2004 Corvette and they scratched my windshield in 2 places on the driver's side.  I wrote to Bosch and they told me to go away, they aren't responsible. I am going to sue them for a new windshield.  Look it up online.  These wipers screw up windshields on a regular basis.  Buy Anco!
B00PO0289C|5|In this video, I cover the installation of three different types of Bartact (TrekArmor) paracord grab handles. The front (TAOGHUPBB), rear (TAOGHRPBB), and headrest (TAOGHHPBB).  I was really impressed with the quality and robustness of these handles, especially compared to the Jeep Wrangler JKU factory handles. They come in many colors, but I am installing the black ones at this time.<br /><br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xgeh_FddjpQ
B0018AO48A|5|Great buy for universal A pillar triple gauge pod
B00JN6JOI6|5|Perfect,
B00UST2ZSI|1|The pink bow came off somewhere while driving-cheap!
B00BY9XKWQ|5|Great product. Great service.
B0024E6V9E|4|The stand holds the Camco filter pretty well. Actually, the filter rests on the intake and outflow pipes. Overall, it does pretty much what it is supposed to do. The only real down side is that it is some times very hard to get it into the ground. With the filter in place, if the legs are not sunk nearly to the cross bar, the filter and stand will tend to tilt over, and perhaps fall. That is not a big disaster; the filter will work laying on the ground. Still, if I wanted it to lay on the ground I would not have bought this stand. I hope Camco can come up with an easier way to seat the stand even in hard ground. With that one caveat solved, this would no doubt be 5 stars.
B000C5E996|5|Fits great on my 2000 GT mustang
B00NHTRI2E|5|Very good looking light. Bigger and better style led then stock. Good buy. Put on a 2005 gsxr 1000
B00FZG14W2|1|Looks great. Exactly like OEM. The reason for one star rating is that item is hideously over priced at over $38.00 for what is a raised 14 letter logo spelling touring edition with a chrome bar between the two words and spaced for mounting between two stickers. Couldn't cost more than a buck to make. Another example of extreme GREED!!!!!!!!!
B000CB6D0S|5|it fits
B005P004FG|4|Wish it was a bit bigger but it is still an amazing car sticker.
B00388RYZ0|5|I put these pipes on my 2013 Kawasaki Vulcan VN900 Custom.  They went on easily and sound GREAT!  Strongly recommend getting the Cobra Fi2000 PowrPro Tuner and Cobra PowerFlo Air Intake Kit and putting everything on at the same time.  I got all three installed easily in a couple hours.  They work extremely well together and have given the bike extra, sustained performance.  NO - I do not work for Cobra.
B007Q13TQI|5|perfect
B00A3WI69M|5|Bought with Powercore4 and EJK Programmer. Gave awesome power gains all around and has a very strong pull in the mid to top end!
B0029EJX08|1|Too small
B000GS1EW4|5|They are probably one of the best out there. My dad has them that is how I now about them. They sound and look amazing.
B00BF0OGPY|4|this item is a great idea but way over priced for what you get, they have you between a rock and a hard spot. you need it for your rev.camera and it the only one that fits there 5th wheel gate.it does look good and is getting the job done.
B000066OC7|2|thin, not useful
B00LX28WAO|5|I have bought two sets on these. I have one wired onto the back of my truck for launching my boat at night and the other on my other truck for better visibility. They are durable and seem to be waterproof. The LEDs are very bright.
B00CM589B8|5|We use it every day in our shower.
B000AS1XYO|5|yes
B001B0VP3E|1|very poor product. One fell of and lost within the first week. Very cheap plastic. Will not buy again. Think twice before buying this product.
B0015C8HT8|5|Was a gift for a family.
B002ZHWYK0|5|Excellent tire cover wife loves it and it fit perfect.  Artwork is beautiful and receives great comments.  I think I need a lock to make sure we remain the owners. Only wish I could have had the picture on the same low gloss material as the tread cover potion of the cover would have looked a little better on the Jeep.  Still a beautiful cover and well constructed. Recommended to other hands down.
B005HR2TM8|5|Fit was perfect easy to<br />Install highly recommend
B000BOA9RY|2|Too hard to get to read an accurate example.  I bought this because I had two floating ball testers that were giving different readings and this one just reads the max protection all the time unless you get the bubbles shaked off.  Too time consuming!
B008VVVIP6|5|yes
B000W0TM6Q|1|Hirrible conpany. Used the 5/8 lock with my camper and the lock BENT very badly. I don't feel safe using it. Talked to the CEO and he blamed it on me for using his stainless steel pin with an equalizer hitch. Really? I'd bet more than half of all customers that use Trimax receiver locks are using them with campers and equalizer hitches! And blaming your customers for what is obviously a design flaw. Junk, don't waste your time.
B0035R0X9I|5|The ride is incredible in my Hyundai Sonata.  I thought it rode decent before after 115K on the original struts, but wow.  Rides like an entry-level luxury car now.
B00D9C2CDO|5|We used this on top of a Ford Freestar for a trip in the south that included severe rainfall events as we were traveling down the interstate.  No water got inside the bag.  While it is probably a couple of inches too long for the Freestar's roof rack we packed the bag so that all of the gear inside it was inside the four roof rack bars, which probably helped in preventing it from moving.  I had thought of buying one of those non-slip mats that others have recommended but chose not to; the bag did not move on the roof.  I also bought some extra tie down straps but I think I've wasted my money; didn't use them.  When we first used the bag I didn't pack it very high and ended up fiddling with the straps to make them shorter.  I packed it a lot higher the second time around and it was packed much more effectively.
B009EA9NBO|5|Perfect fit!
B00Q7GESUO|4|Fit my 04 TJ without any problems. My Border Collie has yet to cause any discernible damage! Only fault is the weak strapping. Be careful not to apply too much tension!
B000SKV4T8|5|Highly recommend! use in my 2014 Harley Davidson Ultra Limited. Engine seems quieter with this oil. It's 100% synthetic, Highly Recommend!
B00069CN2I|1|I received two right mirrors, twice!  Wow!
B00S992JC6|3|fast shipping, fit perfect, even though theyre a bit of a pain but the big thing is theyre not powerful enough to light up second halo. only one halo is visible at all angles, especially during the day
B00ML7IELC|5|My first set that I bought one of the lights stop working after a while.
B003WHBVDI|5|Excellent
B000CFFAQM|5|It worked fine for me.  Much cheaper cost than others sold it for.  I'm happy so far.  I may update this later if anything changes.
B00F0VMMSW|5|A must need tool if you own and service a VW.
B00OWS4ON0|5|Had to trim one of the bars under cover for Ram 1500, after that installation was easy and works very well.
B00X4Z485G|2|It cannot cover the entire Apple logo as the ad shows.
