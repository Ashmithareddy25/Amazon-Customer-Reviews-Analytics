B0000YEEHG|4.0|Let's give it four stars instead of five, just to tone down the adulation a hair. Face it, although this is a penetrating and powerful film, some people are going to be left completely cold by it. It's not for today's Spider-Man 2 plot compulsive viewers. <br />  <br /> I just watched this film again tonight -- we're blessed with a Bergman festival here in Washington, DC just now (July 2004). I watched it as a quasi-double bill with Through a Glass Darkly -- another movie, like this one, in which Bibi Andersson goes mad. Yet two completely different performances, portraying different-seeming women. <br />  <br /> In this one, as the other plot summaries state, Andersson nurses an actress played by Liv Ullmann who decides to stop talking. Andersson takes that silence as a cue to start talking herself, opening up about herself and the sins of her past. Like so many other serious sixties movies, this one toys with the idea of who is the sane one. <br />  <br /> You should pick your friends carefully and Ullmann proves maybe not Andersson's best bet. Let's not give away too much about what happens, but like so many Bergman pictures this is about whether any two people can truly know each other -- whether you can know the person you're talking to and living with, or whether you only know a mask that person is wearing. Ullmann and Andersson are made up to look very much alike, lending an overt touch to the idea that their personalities are somehow merging or overlapping as they explore themselves through their interactions with each other. <br />  <br /> Their interactions are about all you get -- there are only a few other characters in the film. The two actresses do their thing in seclusion in a typical Bergman seaside setting. Don't expect any car chases! <br />  <br />  <br />
0393324818|5.0|With Michael Lewis, everything begins with 'Liars Poker.' When experts compile the 100 seminal books of the last century, Lewis' Wall Street tale might well be on it. It's that good.<br /><br /> That's a lot to live up to here, but 'Moneyball' delivers. Even if you're not much of a baseball fan here (heck, even Lewis admits he's never been much of a fan), this is compelling, enjoyable reading. Maybe a bit too slavish in its admiration of Billy Beane, but other than that, its very insightful. It's obvious that Lewis sees the parallels between computer jocks like Beane's trusty right-hand man, Paul DePodesta and the young 'quants' who began to dominate Wall Street trading in the 80s. It's a very apropos analogy.<br /><br /> I do suggest that you get the paperback. The updated epilogue to the paperback edition was published as a standalone piece in Sports Illustrated and it recounts the brutal backlash to the book from lifetime baseball 'insiders.' There's a wonderful story Lewis recounts about Joe Morgan, who - in disparaging both the book and Beane - is recounted as saying in interviews 'When Billy Beane writes a book like that...'<br /><br /> Meaning, of course, Morgan - picking up the spiel of the insiders - hadn't even read the book before launching these intellectually dishonest attacks. Nice. Anyway, the epilogue lets you in on these wars, which are equally - if not more - fascinating as the original publication.
0743243315|3.0|Here's one of those books that gets terrific reviews yet comparatively few readers -- and, I predict, will be completely forgotten, say, 10 years from now. <br /> <br />I look forward to Ali's next book. She clearly has talent. But it's not put in service of a great story here. It sounds like it should be a great story -- a knowledgeable account of a world previously unknown to most of us, the Bangladeshi immigrant community in London. But Ali fails to give us a world. She only gives us one point of view. And that point of view, frankly, is boring. <br /> <br />Nazneen has come to England after an arranged marriage. She knows no English and nothing of the culture. Slowly she learns about her new place and comes to understand her husband and the others around her. But because the point of view is so narrowly Nazneen, we as readers are trapped, for the most part, along with her in a gloomy little flat.  <br /> <br />You keep wishing Ali would let other characters take center stage, if only for a while. Nazneen's sister alone, left behind in Bangladesh, has a more interesting story to tell, if only we could read more than fragments. This is a consistent problem throughout the book. We want to know more about people beside Nazneen, whose final triumphs feel rushed and forced. <br /> <br />Ali is often perceptive, but here, too, a little of what she chooses to focus on goes a long way. We learn what certain characters' posture or speech patterns say about their character -- and then Ali repeats the same points about the same characters ad nauseum. <br /> <br />It's far from a terrible book. In fact, Brick Lane is close to a great book -- frustratingly close. Here is a book that could have used a wise (or maybe just pushy) editor. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0001AP12G|5.0|this is great,even cars in sydney bumpo the whole album.a lyrical genius
B00005RY7X|5.0|I can't explain why I like this CD so much...His voice is grinding and near-obnoxious, and the CD is incredibly repetetive, but i keep listening to it.  Generally it's just poorly written rock about drinking and girls, which might be why i like this so much.  It's just fun to listen to. <br /> <br />A refreshing breeze when most other rock sounds exactly the same.
B00004WKII|5.0|Yes this is a great collection, it contains some SMOKING live material and studio rehearsals but contains some filler on the first disc. The set starts with a previously unreleased version of Purple Haze. And there's a reason it was unreleased: its a bad take! Hendrix fudges one of the guitar lines. Likewise Foxy Lady. During Hey Joe Hendrix laughs about how the headphones are too loud. 3rd Stone begins with Hendrix and Eddie Kramer cutting up during the vocal overdubs. Hey its in good fun and the take of the song is different (but inferior) to the one on Are You Experienced? &quot;Burning of the Midnight Lamp&quot; is kinda cool as we hear Hendrix overdubbing the harpsichord part. None of this stuff is essential but it is fun to hear the studio chatter and mistakes, at least for me. The previously unreleased versions of the other studio cuts on the 1st CD are pretty cool though. Lover Man is taken as an instrumental and is killer. The live versions of Killing Floor, Hey Joe, Rock Me Baby and Like a Rolling Stone are essential. So they padded the 1st CD a bit: Highway Chile was released on the extended version of &quot;Are You Experienced?&quot;, its OK in lieu of what else is on this 4 CD box set.<br /><br /> The rest of the collection is fantastic: there are incredible live versions of Hendrix classics, rehearsal tapes of the band live in the studio (the version of Spanish Castle Magic is amazing) and unreleased tracks. There are some true gems on this collection. Its very worthwhile for the less than obssesive Hendrix fan. The obsessive Hendrix collector is going to have most of this stuff in other forms, but for everybody else there's enough new stuff to make it very interesting and the packaging is quite good. I consider myself to be a Hendrix fanatic and I did have a lot of this stuff on crappy, scratched vinyl bootlegs and inferior CDs so I was very happy to get this material sounding as good as it does in a new, well thought out CD boxed set. Despite the filler on the first CD, this collection is definitely worth having for any Hendrix fan.the first CD, this collection is definitely worth having for any Hendrix fan.
B000286S8S|5.0|Wow! It's about time that they came out with this new CD. Thank God for Sammy Hagar's return to the band. The new songs: It's About Time, Up For Breakfast, Learning To See, reflect a band that has grown into a perfect chemistry. Eddie's playing is the best I have heard, he is ferocious on these songs. Hopefully we will be hearing much more of this band. <br /> The Cd very well deserves 5 stars...it was long overdue...
B000002UVX|4.0|Yes this is the funkiest Hendrix you will ever hear. The rhythm section of Buddy Miles on drums and Billy Cox on bass are steady and grooving and force Hendrix into a more funky, rhythmic vein. There's great guitar playing on the stand out track \\"Machine Gun.\\" Definitely the best version ever recorded.  It's other worldy, both primitive and science fiction modern at the same time.  Other highlights are the spacy avant-funk rock of \\"Power To Love\\" and the groove of \\"Message To Love.\\" Hendrix plays some truly smoking and swinging leads on every song, and Buddy Miles background vocals add a great deal to the atmosphere of Hendrix's music.  Now on the somewhat questionable aspects of this album:  Buddy Miles sings lead on two songs.  His song \\"Them Changes\\" is good R&B with some very nice Hendrix guitar and bass playing by Billy Cox.  But the vocals are a bit over the top and bombastic. Buddy's other vocal showcase \\"Who Knows\\" while very good, goes on WAY too long.  Extending the song with vocal solos may have worked live but listening to the CD it gets boring and seems a bit self indulgent. I don't want to listen to the vocal stylings of Buddy Miles, I want to hear Hendrix. It's perhaps due to Buddies vocal histrionics that Hendrix fired him soon after these concerts.<br /><br /> Buddy's vocals notwithstanding, this is a very good CD with some of the best and unique live Hendrix you're ever gonna hear. Pick up the \\"Live at the Fillmore East\\" also to get a more complete picture of these concerts, ie alternate recordings and many songs that weren't released on the original version.  There is also a Band of Gypsys version that has several bonus songs in addition to the original Capital album, that's the one to get. I'm giving this 4 stars because of the albums brevity and Buddy's singing.
0792844882|5.0|I love Showgirls. Actually I don't just love Showgirls. I LOVE Showgirls. This movie is so cool, so fun, so funny. I don't understand why everyone doesn't love this film. <br /> It should be required viewing for film students. <br />  <br /> Give Elizabeth Berkely a break!! It was her first big film. Heck, haven't YOU ever made a mistake?? She isn't that bad.  <br />  <br /> I think Kyle MacLachlan's character is a hoot. He's such a creep! At the end, when Nomi is crying and MacLachlan grabs her and sleazily whispers in her ear - that's right, baby, you're gonna be a big star!. Ha!!!  <br />  <br /> I could watch this movie every day. I think Im gonna buy it.
B00003CXGP|4.0|It was around three years ago when I first saw this movie, and I loved it. It's not something I could watch all the time, but every few months I stick it in the DVD player if I can't find anything else to watch. <br /> <br />Christian Bale's performance was fantastic. I honestly couldn't think of anyone else more suited to the part. He looks, talks and acts precisely as he should and his entire character was believable. Most people seem to think that Reese Witherspoon was not so great, but I liked her- the part she played was the same as most of her other parts, whiny and ditzy, and the role suited her down to the ground. <br /> <br />This film is amusing, although I wasn't sure whether it was supposed to be or not! I love the way that Patrick Bateman talks about music and morality as he openly prepares to kill his latest victim, and they don't even notice. Jean is the only character that I didn't like. She seemed a bit hollow and sort of dull. From the way she was portrayed, you can tell she is very wary of Bateman, and I'm surprised that the film didn't allow her to explore the suspicions she obviously felt towards Bateman. <br /> <br />All in all though, I think my favourite parts of this movie is when Bateman is describing himself and his emotions. It's really insightful and very well researched. <br /> <br />This movie has some slightly shocking moments, but these become quite funny the second time you watch because you already know what's going to happen, and you can appreciate it's rather morbid comedy value.
B00000099Y|3.0|Yes, Tool is very popular and gets played on MTV and radio... But they deserve much more respect than their other Nu Metal/mainstream couterparts.  Aenima, along with the other Tool albums, are all good listens.  Aenima has solid songs on it, and is probably my favorite Tool album.  The artwork on the album is interesting and the music is suprisingly creative.  So I urge fans of all forms of metal or even rock to check Aenima out.  I believe Tool has always been able to write songs for themselves and not corporations, etc.  The mainstream came to them, and that is why I respect them.  But for fans to be proclaiming that 'Maynard is God', or Tool is the most talented band ever, please get over it.  And to see the all too well known Tool fan wearing black and saying:  'How much of a genious they are, and calling everyone else dumb sheep,' it makes me really sad for those people.  Hmmm...  Think about it:  Who is REALLY the sheep?..  Anyway, immature fans aside, great album by a respectable band.  I consider them Progressive I guess, but it seems that Adam Jones uses his guitar to create more of a sonic atmosphere than using it to go into some insane guitar solo or crazy time signature.  So any person interested in more technical Prog look into Opeth, Symphony X, Porcupine Tree, Dream Theater, Agalloch, Green Carnation, Evergrey, etc.  But a person wanting a more simple, but still good, approach to Prog, you of course, need to buy a Tool album.
B00006879E|4.0|does the 1st 2 singles sound like Hanson or what?!
B000001FS3|5.0|A unique CD from a unique group. As a Christian, I can appreciate Bono's references to Christ and the eternal joys he brings, in songs like Where the Streets Have No Name. I visualized approaching heaven's gates after listening to the intro to the song; I thought of my grandfather and if I hadn't held my tears back because of male pride, I would have cried. This album speaks to the human condition, the afflictions each of us faces. Bono and his bandmates know this better than many, not only because of their tireless work with DATA, but also considering the tragic tension between Irish Catholics and Protestants (who are both Christians!). I hope more people are affected to love and good deeds by this album as I know my friends and I have been.
1592400876|5.0|A great book on a much needed topic. Hopefully, they will use this in classrooms across the US
B000002H97|1.0|This CD, simply put is horrible. Enter Sandman has incredibly weak lyrics and is a piece of crap that sets the tone for an album that is incredibly weak and not heavy from begining to end. The fact of the matter is that Metallica sold out and every song on this album is a pop-rock piece of crap. I reccomend you buy Slayer's Reign In Blood, or one of my personal favorites, Megadeth's Rust In Peace. Megadeth is going to re-release their first 8 albums on July 27 so you can but it remastered. Those two albums are true metal masterpieces, unlike this overrated trash.
B00000K31V|5.0|If you like Naked Lunch or any of Cronenbergs recent films you will probably like this. Lots of organic sexuality in the shape of a game pod controller, and a sort of anus looking bio port in which the characters plug in to play the game.The surreal salamander slaughter house segment is superb, there is a skeletal pistol that shoots human teeth, which Jude Law eats the flesh off before finding out it is the gun. I like the whole game idea, It's a great concept. If you just have to have everthing spelled out for you in a film, with a happy rational ending, then this movie is NOT for you, but if you like the work of Cronenberg, Juenet, Lynch, etc. you will enjoy this film.
0553573403|5.0|I ve been a devoted fan of Robert Jordan and was reluctant to read anything else. Well, IM GLAD Im over the Wheel of Time and could finally grab the first book of A Song of Ice and Fire. I wanted to write a review even before I finished it because it is just TOO GOOD, a beautiful prose, agile, direct. Characters are so human, with flaws, talents, compassion and feelings. Turning points at everypage turn, just when you thought it was going to be a predictable situation BOOM! the unexpected happens. I really enjoyed reading Book 1 and I am now starting book 2 , happy to have replaced the commercialized  endless Robert Jordan' s Series (sorry! I ve had it with you Mr Jordan). Mr Martin, count me in!!!!!
0553382179|1.0|First Marla Cilley says the book is not about cleaning. Then she proceeds to tell you exactly, step by step, how to clean your kitchen sink. Rather inconsistent. Not only that, but you're supposed to keep dirty dishes UNDER the sink, never in the sink, even leaving a note in the sink for your kids to keep the sink empty. What about your cleaning supplies under the sink? What about the dirty dishwater spilling out?<br /><br />Also, you should at all times wear lace-up shoes IN the house. Why? Because it will make you feel more professional. Uncomfortable, but professional.  After working all day, then doing errands, when I get home at 6:30 PM my shoes come OFF. And I am not changing into lace up shoes for the rest of the evening or any time I am at home on the weekend. If I need to go outside for a BRIEF period of time, I have a pair of slide-on sandals next to the door.  VERY simple.  I mean, how much trash or donations are these flylady babies taking out all hours of the day and night, every SINGLE day?<br /><br />The rest of the book contains instructions on what to clean and when. All instructions come with gushy religious overtones.<br /><br />I recommend Organizing From The Inside Out by Julie Morgenstern over this book. Or really, just about anything else. This book is a poor effort and in no way appealed to me.
B000148KK2|5.0|This was an exellent collection of songs that moves Diana Krall toward a more contemporary sound. Her jazz roots still remain, but she cuts it loose by crossing musical boundaries by sounding much like Joni Mitchell, Phoebe Snow, and Norah Jones. With her musical collaboration with Elvis Costello, there are inklings of her using a vocal style similar to Costello's, such as the song, Love Me Like a Man.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this album really jazzes-up Krall's music a bit more. There are quiet moments, but very atmospheric and may create a sort of imagery with the tracks, Black Crow and Departure Bay. This is a recommended disc for jazz lovers and those who want to sample contemporary jazz music.
B00005JN2F|1.0|I was looking forward to seeing this movie right up until the trailers were over and the roller-coaster started. The so called &quot;artsy&quot; camera work was nauseating at best. It looked like it was shot by Otis of Mayberry. Read the books and skip this movie, what a total disapointment.
B0000DJZ9T|5.0|First of all I must state that I am an avid, almost obsessive fan of Coldplay so this review may be biased, but if you aren't also a fan, then why are you even thinking of buying the DVD?  <br />  <br /> That being said, this DVD is AMAZING. I have read the other reviews, especially the ones giving a paltry 1 or 2 stars. Or &quot;starts&quot; as someone wrote. The biggest complaints they have is the DVD being too much like a music video or nothing new when compared to the CDs. Some say Coldplay lacks talent, or that they are pro-tooled and can't stand on their own at a live show. I can tell you from a first hand account that this is entirely NOT SO.  <br />  <br /> I have had the privilege to see Coldplay play an intimate set at a small DC club before the release of A Rush of Blood to the Head. They are simply amazing, and Chris definitely CAN sing and hit his notes and harmonies. A few mistakes were made, but they were just laughed and joked about later on in the set.. in the no-glitz-no-glamour fashion that makes us all fall in love with Coldplay in the first place. Also, as a fellow musician, I can say that I believe they are very musically talented without the tools of the studio. And the flashy lights in Politik that viewers probably are thinking of when they call the concert nothing but a big music video add to the power and raw effect of the song. <br />  <br /> The DVD captures the essence of a Coldplay live set. I can't stop watching it. When I first got it I left it in my DVD-Rom for a couple of weeks and played it whenever I had free time. I highly recommend this DVD for any Coldplay fan.. and even those who aren't fans, YET. The CD is also incredible. As a fan of live music, I give this set my seal of approval (which probably doesn't mean much to you readers, but if it doesn't, then why bother reading a review?) <br />  <br /> Please if you own this DVD and think it's crap, sell it NOW. Someone else with much better taste will buy it from you and appreciate it as it deserves, which consequently, is more than you ever could.
B000002AH9|5.0|Billie sings, &quot;You don't know what love is until you have the blues.&quot; With this incredibly deep and beautiful recording, you'll have a pretty good idea what love is, and what heartache and dispair are too. This is a very touching collection that is a must for all Lady Day fans. Yes, Billie's voice is a bit rough around the edges and has lost some of its range, yet, her emotion and phrasing are astounding and perhaps better than ever. The orchestration is awesome and compliments Billie perfectly. Lady in Satin is a one-of-a-kind jewel.
B0001V07ZQ|4.0|This is a very good movie, with the exception scene of the character with the cannonball (if you've seen the movie, you know what I mean). This movie features two great battle scenes and shows a decent &quot;slice of life&quot; for an English ship in the Napoleonic Wars and shows the cunning of two great captains as they chase and fight their way around South America.<br /><br /> I hope that Russell Crowe and company make more of these since they come from a series of books. I'll watch them all.<br /><br /> I recommend that the home viewer use the close captioning so that he or she can read all of the great lines used by the Englishmen used during the battle scenes. My favorite is used by one of the men in a rowboat who yells at the others, 'Pull! Pull like you're pulling a Frenchman off of your mother!'
B0001XAPX8|3.0|I knew nothing about the movie before I saw it. I Thought it'd be some thriller, and I was wrong. Even though it's no thrill, it's still good.  Good acting and an interesting plot. A little long, but it moves along smoothly.
B00023BLXK|5.0|This movie was fantastic!! I didn't really like Romola Garai, but Diego Luna was awesome. The dancing, the music, it was all great. The dialogue wasn't that funny or interesting, but the soundtrack is perfectly flowing. I would recommend this movie to any one.
B00008EY65|2.0|Hellboy is your regular comic book action movie with fight scenes that involve too much CGI. Wasnt enjoyable, more like eye candy.
B000069HK2|5.0|this the perfect band if you are into rock hardcore emo screamo the whole deal it's everything you could ask for put onto one disc, every one of these songs are favourites and the more you listen to this album the more hooked you get, if you are into thrice dashboard finch starting line tbs anything along those lines get this you will not regret it i promise. if this is your genre this cd is a must have you will not get bored of this and you will enjoy this more than any of those other bands out there, plus bert is sexy!!!
0375432302|4.0|I think the problem with the Da Vinci Code is that you cannot identify with the characters.  Although there are a lot of thrills and spills in the novel, your emotion does not go up and down that much because you do not really care about the hero and heroine.  Dan Brown does not bring his characters to life in readers' minds.
B0001FR3IG|4.0|Gothika is a good movie, offering a spook filled fun ride the first time you see it, after that, it loses it's scare factor. But the dark, gothic atmosphere and storyline keep the movie interesting enough that you'll wanna watch it again. Recommend it for anyone into a good horror movie where a hot chick gets naked. lol
0452285186|4.0|but they sure make me happy! Sick, wrong, and a whole lot of fun! <br /> <br />I wish there had been more cartoons, and I didn't think that the panels showing the aftermath of the suicides were necessarily the best ones in the volume, but there is nothing funnier in the world than the bunnies' cute little deadpan faces as they earnestly seek their deaths.
B0000VAFNQ|4.0|This movie is a pretty interesting, fast paced action ride about vampires fighting werewolves. However, it kinda ends there. The plot does not have much depth. This guy has special blood to become a vampire lycan thing. The guy who everyone thought was dead was alive. The good guys were the bad guys. Pretty shallow. However, the action in this movie is worthwhile, and makes it a buyworthy selection. Also, the gothic air in this movie is very entertaining, as it supports the whole vampire theme. And Kate Beckinsale in tight leather should make it watch worthy anyways. lol
B000267JQK|5.0|I must admit I really didn't know anything about Seether, other than that &quot;Broken&quot; song with Amy Lee, so Evanscence comes to town with Seether, Breaking Benjamin and Three Days Grace and been an Evanescence fan, I go. Seether comes right before Evanescence and bring down this humongous cool looking Seether curtain, lights go off, and they start off with a song called gasoline. I don't know if it was the excitement, or the mass hysteria, but I just FROZE, those guys can ROCK! One by one, all the songs were awsome, and so was the show, culminating with Amy Lee singing Broken with the hairy Dude, just plain AWSOME. Why am I raving about the concert in a CD review? because this is not just a CD, which in my opinion is just great rocking fun, but there is also a DVD in the package, and this DVD has videos, as well as short documemntay on how they made the &quot;broken&quot; video and my favorite, 5 or 6 Live performances which took me right back to the day before yesterday when I saw them in concert. I would've paid that price for this DVD alone. There are also 8 new songs in this CD. <br />  <br /> If you are a fan of Seether, you NEED this one, if you don't know them, but do like hard rock/heavy metal, give this a try, I know I did and was hooked.
B00005JMEW|5.0|The arterial bleeding and fight scenes in this movie are so unbelievably exaggerated that you can't help but fall in love with it as you watch yakuzas get hacked to bits. The plot of this movie is very cliched. The typical they tried to kill me but i lived and now i'm back for revenge plot. The language in this movie is used a bit out of place, and isn't really appropriate, but the movie still rules. Besides, Lucy Liu and her body guard with the school girl outfit are hot enough to make this movie worth watching for them alone. lol. buy it if you like cheesy kung fu films with swords and blood.
B00005B36H|5.0|tool writes some of the best songs ive ever heard. the grudge is a perfect way to start off this album and it shows that they can switch from a hard song like that to a more mellow song like the patient which is an amazing song.  <br /> <br />every song on this album is mysterious and creative and thats what makes this one of their best albums. u get to hear how talented maynard is holding that note out for 23 seconds and u also get to hear how beautiful his voice is in songs like parabol that leads slowly into parabola which is a great song and is kindof different then alot of tool songs because of its different tuning than dropped d. i love adams guitar part at the end of parabola, so dark. after that goes into tick and leeches wich is the only song that stands out for being more heavy than the rest but danny's drums are so great in this song and tool can write a heavy song different than anyone else. <br /> <br />probably my favorite song on the cd is lateralus. and some of the other songs that knowone else prob bothers to listen to are disposition and reflection which are also amazing songs so dont make that mistake and listen to the whole cd.
B00005JL3A|3.0|This is an...alright adaptation. There are much worse. The action scenes are cool, and the effects are pretty cool, but the zombies look pretty tacky. They aren't the half rotted brown sacks of maggot covered flesh that infest the game. They're these pale white half rotten things with no maggots at all! And where in the game does the Licker mutate?! That was ALL messed up!!! And some parts in this movie just suck, like when Kaplan dies(he's the best character), and when Milla Jovovich ends up being the last one to live. I don't care how hot she is or how unbelievably awesome she looks naked, the last person standing theme of horror movies is WAY too cliched!!! This movie is reccommended for someone who's a die hard fan of the video game series and/or headbangers(like myself).
B000007WNN|5.0|This was my first exposure to The Cult.  Looking back, I'm sure fans of the Love album were pretty surprised.  The one constant is Ian Moore's fantastic voice.    There is actually a CD set out there of the sesions in between the Love record (and they were records), and this release.  If you can find them, they're worth it from the point of hearing how Electric was really going to be an extension of the Love album sound--that New Wave fuzzy guitar thing.    Then Rick Rubin (don't know why I originally typed Bob Rock here--thanks for the catch above)  was brought in, and this has to be one of his best jobs ever--stripping everything down to the basics, three chords, and one of the best hard rock drum sounds ever.  Every song on here is worth a listen, so I won't give a track by track break down.  I will say that a good portion of these are their staples, and Love Removal Machine became their peak achievment as a closing song...and there are so many various versions of it out there that you can tell how much they liked it themselves.      I played this tape over and over ad inifinitum, and after that soaked up as much of The Cult as I could.  I've come to appreciate all of their phases and have seen them in concert 3 times, and its never enough.      As for this CD, if you're a fan of what I term 80's hard rock you really owe it to yourself to get one hard rock CD that never sounds totally dated.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|This is one the dumbest funny movies I've ever seen. It's INCREDIBLY stupid, but not too over the top(like the idiotic, pointless, waste of the forever it seems to take to end film Super Troopers). Anyone looking for laughs and seeing an all star cast look like a bunch of idiots doesn't need to look any further than Mr. Derek Zoolander. This movie is LOADED with hilarious laughs at the pointless yet lovable stupidity. Yep, this film is pure idiocy and I LOVE it! It's a great comedy for someone who's a die hard comedy lover and/or someone who's just looking for something lighter than the typical drama. Great stuff.
B00006690G|5.0|This CD is bomb! Every song on this awsome CD is meaningful, catchy, and helps you understand the life of Eminem. Through the lyrics you learn that stardom has not changed his life. He still loves Hailie Jade, his daughter, more than anything in the world, and takes nothing for granted. I have come to respect, idolize, and look up to Eminem because of his talant reflected through this CD. BUY IT!!!!!!!!!
B00005JKHP|4.0|Although criticized by many for being slow, I find the pace just right for the story, and it helps to convey the sense of unknown. <br /> <br />Visual effects hold up well, and the score is one of the best ever written by Jerry Goldsmith. <br /> <br />Robert Wise has done a good job in finally completing the film, adding visual effects and completing the sound mix. <br /> <br />Worth a view, but don't expect an action film. This is an intelligent film, not a Star Wars clone.
B0000AUHQT|3.0|This movie is both great and awful depending entirely upon one's need for accuracy or how deeply you may have felt about the book by F. Scott Fitzgerald. <br /> <br />Francis Ford Coppola wrote the screenplay for this film and followed the classic book about as closely as a film is capable of doing. But I found the direction to be flawed somehow. The film is filled with starlit close-ups (no one's eyes sparkle like that, not even Daisy's) and smoke screen silhouettes, complex party scenes and plenty of flapper costumes. I just couldn't figure out why all of the strange lighting existed after hiring two nearly perfect looking actors, in Mia Farrow and Robert Redford. I would have preferred to see the stars in Daisy's eyes stem from a great acting performance rather than the eerie sparkles falsely placed in every close-up! <br /> <br />Robert Redford was good as Gatsby and he conveyed some of the character's desperate and lonely love. I was disappointed that all of the complexity of Gatsby was never fully explained. If I would not have known the story beforehand I would have never understood what tied Gatsby and Daisy together, other than money of course. But Redford captures Gatsby's aloofness to a tee and one can easily see why Daisy would be in love with Gatsby. <br /> <br />I found Mia Farrow to be disappointing as Daisy Buchanan, the spoiled debutante who manages to seduce the great Gatsby for a lifetime. As stated previously Farrow's close-ups were far too crafted to seduce anyone. She came across as a flirty silly girl more than a classic seductress and paled in comparison to Redford's portrayal of Gatsby. She looked cute in all of the frilly costumes of course, but I never really found her character believable. <br /> <br />Karen Black is downright scary as the mistress of Mr. Buchanan, with her eyes crossing and spitting with every close-up. Bruce Dern plays the arrogant competitive Mr. Buchanan with great nastiness. Sam Waterston steals the show however withhis portrayal as the narrator of the story. He captures innocence and compassion while keeping his open-eyed curiosity and faithfulness to Gatsby from beginning to end.  <br /> <br />Overall this film is good, if you have read the book first, but lacks a full explanation. The filmmakers relied more on scenery and lighting than perfect casting and a deeper meaning. Some scenes are magical while others fall flat. For Redford fans and lovers of the 20's it is a gem. The greed and power hungry people are captured but sadly the deepest desires of all that passion become lost behind the filmmakers vision.   <br />
B0001AVZA8|4.0|<br />Romantic comedy with stellar cast. Jack Nicholson plays himself, an aging Lothario chasing younger women. A heart attack lands him in the seaside home of the mother of one of those young women. This 'mother' turns out to be Diane Keaton, a playwright of some fame. An interesting little triangle develops. Keanu Reeves, the cardiologist, falls hard for Keaton, who is always one sexy dame. Nicholson falls for her, too. Keaton is in the enviable position of having 2 men, who have maybe a 25 year age gap between them, salivating over her.  <br />The scenes of the developing relationship, including a nude scene for Keaton and a bare-butt scene for Nicholson, are marvelous fun and quite believable. <br />The there are detractions. Frances McDormand's talents are wasted in a role as Keaton's sister, a role that is far too small for her. Reeves' role is understated, gentlemanly - and ultimately unbelievable. Not unbelievable in terms of a man falling for a woman 15+ years his senior, but unbelievable in terms of the minimal emotional range he brings to his performance.  <br />But the best part by far is the fact that this romantic comedy doesn't deal with the foibles of 20-30yo actors; it focuses with truth and affection on the foibles of a 'mature couple.' <br />Great theater. <br />
B000002KDI|5.0|I bought this album when I was about 13 and it was the coolest thing I'd ever heard. I've probably purchased it since then, 5 or 6 times as one way or another I've lost or broken them, but I've always had to have it in my collection. <br />I was sitting around partying the other night and I put it on and was amazed that I still knew every note and could even still play all the harmonica pieces.  <br />A true classic that as far as I know nobody ever heard, well that's what I thought until I read the other reviews. I'm glad to see I have better taste than I even knew. <br />Like somebody said, once you hear these versions of many of his most famous songs, you won't be satisfied with any other version. <br />What more can I say? It's just simply great. <br />
B000255LIY|3.0|The original Lion in Winter is one of my all time favorite films, which is odd because, except for rare occasions, I never much cared for either Katherine Hepburn or Peter O'Toole.  So, when I saw this new version of the movie on the movie rental shelves, I was rather excited as I like both Patrick Stewart and Glen Close a lot.   <br />The film was, unfortunately, a disappointment.  Close and Stewart both do well, their timing isn't as impeccable as O'Toole's and Hepburn's, so the film loses some of it's humor, but they do manage to make the parts their own.  Jonathon Rhys-Meyers is VERY good as King Phillip and better, in fact, than the original. Also better than her original incarnation is the actress who plays Alice (I'm not sure if that's the correct spelling of her name), she's much stronger than the original girl and makes her role more important. <br />Where the film really fails is in the boys.  First of all none of them seem to have any relationship with their parents.  The first film had the feeling of a family squabble over the holidays.  This one is more of a love story between Close and Stewart with Alice in the middle.  The boys and Phillip seem incidental and though that is the point of Phillip's character it should not be so of the brothers.  Also, how the boys are played is a problem.  Richard is not likeable and though it's mentioned that he writes poems and that is played up in his character is the war side.  When Henry claims Richard was the best I'm a bit dubious as in this version Geoff seems to be, which also shows a failure in how the film makers percieved Geoffrey's character.  I think perhaps they felt sympathetic towards him because no one loved him, but I feel no one loved him for a reason, which never comes across in this version.  As for John his main problem is just that the actors to old to be believable in the role. <br />The other main problem with this version is that it's soooo slow.  It takes ages for it to get its audience interested and even then it just sort of meanders towards its conclusion.  I don't know if this is the fault of editing or what.  I know at the beginning it's the fault of too many scene changes, a problem with which most play-to-movie adaptions are fraught. <br />I'd also like to say that the computer matt-paintings for the outdoor shots and exterior shots of the castle are just awful as is the case in everything Hallmarks has made since and including Gulliver's Travels.  This is a problem that's easy to overlook, however. <br />Ultimately, the movie is interesting despite being slow and it's fun to watch Close and Stewart especially towards the end.  The best scene is credited to Close in which she's trying on her jewels after her first defeat and she joined one by one by her children.  She really made you feel for her. <br />I've given the movie three stars, which, to me, means it's definately worth watching once, but not buying.
B00025ETIW|4.0|My Chemical Romance are anything but normal. Their braid all sort of music, from punk to screamo, from hardcore to pop-punk, and from rock to pop. They do it with their unique style which no one else does. Their lyrics are unique, yet amazing. Unlike their debut album, the production is far more different, and there is a sense of some songs being slightly overproduced. The songs are far more catchy and at times poppier. Though, the album still is a impressive release. Here a few stand outs:        1. 'Helena' - The start is as unique as you can get. I've never heard anything like that before, and it sort of did put me off for awhile. The song races into top gear with an infectious chorus that will leave you singing. The chorus vocals, reminds me of Atreyu singing.    4. 'You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison' - A long/weird/funny title of one of the stand outs. I've never heard any thing like this before. It starts with a infectious vocal part, and reminds me of something like Micheal Buble. That might sound dumb at first, but it does sound like this very polished, and sophisticated vocals, but its very amazing. The chorus is typical My Chemical Romance, hard and fast, before it burst into an amazing guitar solo.    5. 'I'm Not Okay' - The first single, everybody has heard it. Some feel its far too pop, i feel its a good song and something everybody sings too.    8. 'Thank You For The Venom' - I love this song. Its probably one of my favorites. The song chorus is as catchy as any can get, and it shows a lot of their melodic pop-punkness. The prechorus vocals remind me of Millencolin. Another great guitar solo.    11. 'It's Not a Fashion Statement, It's a Deathwish' - If you feel theres a word missing from that title, well there is. This song is fast paced and the chorus strikes you. Really good lyrics. The screamo edge of MCR.    12. 'Cemetery Drive' - Another one of my favorites. It starts slow, and then explodes at the chorus. With yet another infectiouschorus that will leave you singing.        My Chemical Romance's record, 'Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge', is a solid release. A lot of people didn't take these guys seriously before and felt all they do is sing vampiers and are strange. Since then, these guys have signed to a major label, toured endless amounts of times, and have clearly learned and grown up during that process. It's time to start taking these guys seriously, because they here to stay. Do pick this record up, and along their debut, 'I Brought You My Bullets You Brought Me Your Love'. On a different topic, i don't get is how this record got the 'parental advisory' sticker on it. They only swear once.

B000005H3R|5.0|Five FABULOUS Stars. This is quite a magnificent CD and every performance is masterful. The triple Grammy-winning Dianne Reeves is simply one of the best jazz singers of all time and she's accompanied by a squad of legends: Kenny Barron, James Moody, Phil Woods, Al Grey, Toots Thielemans, Joe Williams, Harry &#34;Sweets&#34; Edison, Clark Terry, etc. Whew!!!  It's true, great musicians love to play behind and with great singers!!   One 'Piece De Resistance, &#34;Cherokee&#34;, is simply a wonderfully dynamic performance of an old warhorse made new. Slipping from 3/4 to 4/4 and back again, Dianne's work is stunning. I just put the CD player on 'repeat' and let it go over and over. On the bridge &#34;Dreams of summertime....&#34; both passes are executed with so much ease and on the sonic arc of her voice, that one could miss the fact that they are very different, launched on different beats. And Bobby Watson throws down a sizzling killer alto solo. Speaking of killer solos, &#34;Besame Mucho&#34;, brilliantly sung in English and Spanish, has some great harmonica solos from Toots, in a Monkish vein.  &#34;Tenderly&#34; is a fascinating rangy duet between the poised Ms Reeves and consummate blues belter Joe Williams, who hits, trust me, the LOWEST note ever sung on the last syllable of &#34;Breathless....ly&#34;. Wow, Mr Williams!! My speakers barely passed that test. &#34;Tenderly&#34; lives up to it's title and both singers are magnificent.  &#34;Old Country&#34; is another winner, dished up with a big band sound and some heartfelt singing from Diane, who issues a judgement on a life and a message. The bluesy Sarah Vaughn classic &#34;After Hours&#34; now belongs to Dianne, and Moody's sax solo is just perfect. The very fun &#34;Ha!&#34; has Moody and Terry in the vocal chorus. Get this one, it's all good. My Highest Recommendation. Five WONDERFUL Stars. (Blue Note Records. 10 MP3 Tracks. Time-50:16.)
B00005OAIE|5.0|Come on folks, he did it... again! I bet EVERYONE in the world once in their life experienced the same thing in 'My Stupid Mouth'. I sure as hell did. John Mayer is very different, you either love him or you hate him. There is no such thing as middle ground, if you like faster paced music ie Red Hot Chili Peppers and whatnot, then you better plug your ears. But otherwise, John is for people who are looking for something to calm them down, give you a dose of reality that you aren't alone in this world. He shares the same fears, hopes and dreams as every other person, he just has the balls to let the world know. You've gotta applaud that, at least.
0743244257|1.0|<br /> But really, not a good book. I am a DeLillo fan. I thought Libra was excellent, and I thought Underworld was also incredible. Taut phrasing, good thrust of narrative, intelligent things to say through the story, especially with the former. I was looking forward to this book as an insight to my home, New York, as much as the previous two were insightful about American experience. <br />  <br /> Instead, I received one of the more self-indulgent short books I've ever read. A wealthy &quot;master-of-the-universe&quot; type rides across town, has sex with 3 women whom he could care less about, questions himself, looks down on everyone he talks to, and makes worldly observations that he seems to find important yet are as overly dramatic and weighty as a college freshman's first lit paper. <br />  <br /> One of the main problems, in my opinion, is that the book actually seems dated. Very 80's in it's view of powerful young men who seem convinced they know everything as representative of something important or trend in our society. Didn't we go through this already 15 years ago? Granted, the 90's had the dot-coms, but this guy seems to be a particularly irritating rehash of both decades. <br />  <br /> Lastly, DeLillo's foray into rap lyrics makes me want to throw up. <br />  <br /> BUT, all that being said, DeLillo STILL manages to write sentences and even entire pages that hold together in a way that other writers can only dream about. Insightful and important. But it so infrequent here and so overpowered by phrases such as &quot;His prostate was asymmetrical&quot; that the good is just obliterated by pretension. <br />  <br /> Thankfully, it was short. It might be worth reading just for that reason. <br />  <br /> Timothy J. Beck
B00028HBKM|5.0|This is the only movie I have ever seen that I would call an experience. I have never seen any movie which was so riveting that time seemed to stand still. When it was over I had to just sit in my theater seat, decompressing, listening to the beautiful music. <br />  <br /> This film starts abruptly. I didn't initially realize that I was watching the movie. There are flashbacks to Jesus' ministry and his life. When Jesus was carrying his cross on his way to be crucified, the flashback to the crowds welcoming him a few days before was startling. There's another flashback which is a real tear jerker, and if you haven't seen the film I don't want to even give a hint. I heard about it from a radio show, and even knowing it was coming, the scene still hit me hard. <br />  <br /> I think that there is about 20% or so artistic license in the film. I don't expect any movie to be absolutely perfect. The crucifiction scene reminded me of Monty Python's Life of Brian, as the arms were bound to the cross and then the nails were put through the palms. The shroud of Turin shows the nails going through the wrist, which actually supports a person's weight. <br />  <br /> If a person comes away from this movie untouched, I think that person came to see the movie with to many predjudices. I saw a man cruelly punished, yet he had love and forgiveness, even to his dying breath.
B000001FA4|3.0|With 'The Unforgettable Fire', here we witness a band in transition from it's indie roots on the verge of iconic status. Once again, central to any U2 album is the marriage of The Edge's colourful guitar-chimes, Bono's emotional cries, and profound lyrics/themes. Stand-out tracks include 'Pride (In The Name Of Love)' an inspiring yet haunting homage to Martin Luther King, the heart-warming string-ladened 'The Unforgettable Fire', the vitriolic power of 'Wire', and the epic ballad 'Bad'. The band continues to evolve, gradually straying away from it's raw-alternative sound and political credos, to a more polished and cleaner recording, much of the credit attributed to producer Daniel Lanois. This CD demonstrates a band finding it's identity, shaking the cult/underground status without losing it's musical edge and sharpness. On the cusp of global and mainstream success, 'The Unforgettable Fire' is a calling-card of the greatness that lies ahead.
B000002UAX|5.0|Greatest album ever by the greatest band ever, (and that includes any and all parts, known and unknown, of the universe.  A complete amalgamation of The Beatles.  Brilliant.  So much here it brings me to tears of joy.  The only thing that bugs me, (and just about everyone else in the world,) is Revolution 9... but hell, I may even let that pass if I feel like listening to something creepy...  Anyway, this is where it all came together.  Hard Rock, Acoustic Folk, 20's Style Ballads, Country, Proto-Punk, Calypso(this was pre-Bob Marley kids,) campfire music, an orchastrational lullabye, baroque style harpsischord music, a chuck berry style all-out rocker, etc. etc. etc. Each song is distintive in it's own style, but somehow the whole album comes together... I can't even quite put my finger on it, but the whole thing just meshes... wow.
6305603847|5.0|What varied opinions of this movie. That's exactly what makes it so great!! People can have their different assumptions as to what they were aiming for when creating the film. I see a couple things that this movie could be metaphorically implicating.  <br /> The first is basically what everyone else gets from it. All the problems he has faced in his life, all the bad experiences, have been bricks in the wall that he has built around himself. He has sheltered himself from the world, and has fallen into a deep depression.  <br /> Another way of looking at this, is from a governmental or societal point of view. He is explaining how we are controlled. He shows you how we are told how to think and what to think. We have no freedom of choice. We think we do, but society's rules and thought patterns are still embedded in our head. &quot;We don't need no education, we don't need no thought control&quot;. Everyone's face is the same at parts in the movie; a metaphor showing that we are not individual. &quot;All in all we are all just bricks in the wall&quot; we're nothing more than a brick in the wall called Society. <br /> There is definitely a point to this movie. There are several. Its just a matter of finding them.
B000000W6F|5.0|This album had the pumpkins at their most psychedelic stage.  This is especially present in Rhinoceros, Crush, Suffer, Snail, and Window Paine.  Corgan's lyrics and vocals are some of the best ever (as usual).  The guitars are coordinated perfectly and beautifully.  This album is every bit as good as Mellon Collie or Siamese Dream.  Simply wonderful.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Just like the other albums pure greatness. <br /> &quot;Duality&quot;, &quot;Circle&quot;,&quot;Vermilion pt1 & 2&quot;,actually every song is nice. It has the heavy songs, and the light songs, songs to express hatred,songs to express need and love...i waited a long time for this release and i love it. I recommend 100% if ur a real maggot get this cd!
0345350499|2.0|A complete King Arthur legend told in the perspective of women who wielded power from behind the throne. The novel is very well written in language that captures fantasy readers, but I was thoroughly disappointed. Those who are interested in reading this book, PLEASE READ THIS before you make up your mind, my thoroughly review:    ?THE STORY- the story of this novel is like a soap opera. The kind that you don't know why you are watching it, because you hate it and it's dumb, but you still watch it every single day. That's what the novel is like, not one single good happy thing happened in the book. It's incredibly dull and basically repeats and repeats. I don't know why I'm reading this book yet I'm still compelled to read on, and the ending leaves you with such an empty feeling it's sickening.  ?  THE CHARACTERS- since it's a legend we (or most people) know by heart, you are expected to find some different opinion of the characters, maybe even contradictive views but guess what? The characters in Mists of Avalon are just a big stressing of the original. Bradley stressed the characters so incredibly over-the-line in personality that it's completely outrageous. None of the characters are favorable you basically can't find a hero or heroine you like.     ?THE MAIN CHARACTERS- practically the worst characters in the novel. The main characters are Morgan le Fay and Gwenevier. And let me just give you an overview of each of them: Morgan is basically in first half of the story a big wimp and second half of the story a big lunatic. And Gwenevier I think I speak for all who read the book that she is the least favorable character in the book. She is a big whiny and blames everybody for her own problems and uses her religion to justify it- the kind of character I most hate.     ?RELIGION ISSUES- you basically keep getting this kind of feeling from Bradley's writing: I hate the Christians! But...I mean... all Gods are One God so...but I hate the Christians!!! She made all theChristians sound like idiots and power-lusting bad guys but at the same time saying that it's not their fault... WHAT! I mean, it's okay if this is like an as-you-go kind of detail. But Bradley made it 80 percent of the book. So second thing the novel can be besides a soap opera is a big religion argument in which Christianity is hateful but it still won, think about if you'll like that.    ?FEMINISM- although this novel's main purpose is to reflect feminism, the novel not only is not a feministic book, but also thoroughly destroyed the figure of women. An anti-feministic person can practically say: \\" this is exactly what I meant, that women are seductive evil creatures who seduce men to get what they want.\\" The women in the novel are all incredibly stupid, seductive, and selfish. And when you look at the introduction it said: \\" Both women in their own extraordinary ways- triumph\\" Dude! The ending of this novel is almost the exact opposite. It's more like BOTH WOMEN LOST EVERYTHING FROM THEIR EVIL SCHEME BUT FINALLY FOUND PEACE FROM BEING DRIVEN TOTAL CRAZY. Believe me, this novel is a bad bad BAD way to look at women.     Overall: I definitely DO NOT recommend this book, especially not to fantasy lovers, you will find it disappointing and it will give you a bad day(s) if you read it. If you want a different view of the Arthurian legend, go read \\"I Am Mordred\\" by Nancy Springer; if you want feminism, go read Tamora Pierce's serieses. If you want complicated drama that in the end gives you a bittersweet feeling, go watch Angel the series season three and four, maybe five also. All of these are better than \\"The Mists of Avalon\\".          ~ Annie Feng
1565117794|3.0|I listened to the audio CD. This is a fun, creative book. I'm not going to add to all that's already been written here about the quality of the book itself, other than to say that the reader, Jeff Woodman, is the same narrator who single-handedly ruined Everything Is Illuminated for me. In that book, his ridiculous, phoney Ukranian accent made it hard to listen to an otherwise good book. Here, his ridiculous, phony Hindu accent (that sounds a an awful lot like a phoney Ukranian accent!) does the same. 1 billion Indians in the world and they could find one to narrarate this book?
B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie rests on a simple idea and makes for wonderful viewing: a waitress brings joy into strangers' lives and experiences happiness of her own. There are some genuinely poignant moments in the film, the most touching being when Amelie finally lets her guard down and allows Mr. Photo-Booth guy into her life. I love the last scene when they are motorcycling down the Parisian streets. The film is also a photographic wonder; everything, from the subway to the streets, is infused with color and light. And finally, there are some funny scenes--the gnome posing alongside famous buildings and monuments and Amelie's dad looking at the photos in disbelief is pretty high on the list. Don't forgot to listen to the soundtrack! It's wonderful--I often listen to it in my car and it is great even without the movie.
0735619670|5.0|This book, in my opinion, is one of the books that is absolutely VITAL for any person involving in the software development lifecycle.  It's a must have.  The book covers so many aspects of the topic so well, that it is amazing it's not required for people entering the field. The book will be a resource/reference for any programmer, regardless of experience, language, and role.  It covers all major aspects of code construction, from variable usage to code-tuning.  Although much of the book is common sense, there is a great deal that you never really thought about, but after reading it, you'll see how much better your development cycle could be.  It is a MUST HAVE.
0446310786|5.0|It's hard to say glowing things about &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; that haven't already been said. Atticus is such a beloved character that people name their dogs after him. And I would have to concur that Atticus is one of my favorite characters in literature. Father to Jem and Scout and an upstanding, conscientious lawyer in a small, racist Southern town, Atticus proves throughout the novel how important it is to stand up for what is right. Jem and Scout take heed. I also adore the movie, and Elmer Bernstein's soundtrack is a must have.
0553103547|5.0|I haven't read the rest of the series yet, but I plan to.  However, I did finish reading this book, and I must say, there's HUGE potential here.  The world created by Martin is deep, involved, and interesting.  There is enough intrigue and war to keep the plot interesting and moving, and Martin's style of writing really gives you a great understanding of what's going on from different character's points of view.  I like reading fantasy books every once and a while, but so far, this could end up being one of the greatest series' ever written. Highly recommended to anyone.
B00008EY65|3.0|I went into this with no expectations. I was pretty impressed with the makeup and special effects the most. The acting, story, directing, and music were pretty good as well. All in all I would stack it up against \\"Spawn\\" and say it is better. And it is a close run to Daredevil's level. No it isn't quite the caliber of Spiderman or Blade, but still a very good movie worth seeing. If you are not sure about buying it then rent it first. I bought a copy on a hunch that there was more to it than the ads I saw. I was right. Ron Perlman does a fine job of portraying the comic book hero Hellboy. Ron played the beast in \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" TV series and as a hunchback in the movie \\"The Rose\\". He is no stranger to playing in unusual and demanding roles. This is pretty much a film for most the family. Certainly not suited for children less than eight years old. Some scenes with blood but not nearly as gory as Spawn or some others.
B00000DLVA|5.0|I heard the song &quot;My Favourite Game&quot; and i really loved it so I just had to listen to the rest of the cd. I got it and absolutly LOVE it. I listen to it every day twice a day. The lyrics are so beautiful and the music jsut makes me feel so relaxed. The are now my favorite band and everyone should definatly purcase this cd. <br />
B00020X88O|1.0|This review is in regard to the special “VIP Limited Edition” box set of the movie Showgirls. <br /> <br />I cannot speak to the point about the special features offered on this disc because the disc would not load.  When the box set arrived to me I tried to play the disc in “FIVE” different DVD players all U.S. [region 1] unmodified machines, all less than a year old, and the disc would not load in any of them.   <br /> <br />The disc did not appear to be damaged or scratched so it makes me think it may be an encoding or content error.  It may have just been my disc, but I have had problems with MGM DVDs in the past, IMHO this company is the pits when it comes to DVD production. <br /> <br />I think that it is also worth mentioning that this latest release of Showgirls has no deleted scenes or extra footage unlike the recent re-release of Wild Things.  I was a fan of the original “so bad, it’s good” movie, but unless you need some shot glasses and pasties, I would just stick with the original [less expensive] DVD release since like I said this version ads no new footage/scenes to the actual movie itself. <br /> <br />So just FYI, buyer beware, YMMV, etc, etc ;-)
B0001XAPX8|3.0|Early in &quot;The Human Stain,&quot; a young man meets a woman. It's *the* woman, and although the scene is short it is perfectly played, and we know. We also know that the young man harbors a secret, which he will be forced to reveal just once, after which the woman will be lost, and so will the man for 45 years. Philip Roth's book and Robert Benton's movie is about that man, Coleman Silk, in his final year, and how he finds himself again in a woman. <br />  <br /> The movie is, of course, much more complex than that. Too complex.  <br />  <br /> Silk is the mastodon dean of the classics department at a New England liberal arts school who is charged with racism after referring to absent students as &quot;spooks.&quot; Those students, whom Silk has never seen, are black. And so is Silk, though, played by Anthony Hopkins, he doesn't look it. Nor does anyone else know, because that's his secret. Faced with revealing his race to save his job, Silk instead resigns, his wife dies from the shock of Silk's tumultuous decline, and the fallen dean befriends a reclusive writer (Gary Sinise). He also meets a dairy worker, Faunia (Nicole Kidman), who's young, rough around the edges, sexually adventurous.  <br />  <br /> And so begins Silk's reawakening. Roth's book jumps around freely in time and points of view and so does the movie in an attempt to make some coherent point about privacy, personal identity, shame and loss. The book and movie are set against the backdrop of the Clinton/Lewinsky scandal - it seems like a grab for historical import in the book, while it is a distraction in the movie - and has several scenes set in the 1940s, as an 18-year-old Silk (Wentworth Miller) meets Minnesotan Sheena (Jacinda Barrett) and begins a brief, intense courtship. Miller and Barrett, in short shrift, develop instant, excellent chemistry - better than Hopkins and Kidman do in the present day scenes - which makes the moment when Sheena meets Silk's refined, soft-spoken black mother (Anna Deveare Smith) direct and tragic. <br />  <br /> Silk's new romance is equally troubled, although it's Faunia with the disreputable label. She broadcasts her flooziness, and her husband, ex-Vietnam vet Lester (an electric, scary Ed Harris) hunts her from one sexual encounter to another. Silk, robust and virile as he is, is not fully prepared for this woman or her past. <br />  <br /> &quot;The Human Stain&quot; only works in spots; like the book, it has its moments, such as when old Silk dresses down a preppy lawyer, or Sheena &quot;dances&quot; for young Silk, but Benton and screenwriter Nicholas Meyer pile on so many themes that we're left only the aroma of a story, not an actual one. Kidman is the wrong actress for Faunia - talking in low scratch and chain-smoking does not a roughwoman make. Hopkins is better, but curiously distant as Silk, who is so far inside his own vision of himself that he still seems to be peering out for the coast to be clear. Harris steals every scene he's in, which is few.  <br />  <br /> The movie would been smarter to stay rooted in the past, during Silk's critical growth period. The present day material feels strangely like three old men - Roth, Benton and Meyer - getting off on a tough-skinned naked woman running her hand over a bewildered older man's body.
0790729407|5.0|Not being Irish, and being ignorant of the true history of the IRA and the conflict between England and Ireland, I cannot hope to offer any guidance as to the historical accuracy of this movie, nor its bias (or lack of it), but if you watch the documentary on this DVD you will see that the Director (Neil Jordan) himself says that some of the incidents in the movie were slightly changed. However that is to be expected of most movies that try to present history in an entertaining way. <br /> <br />And entertaining it is. Divorced from the reality from which it is based, the movie makes excellent drama; you have the classical David and Goliath scenario here with the British Empire being brought to its knees by a handful of very amateur assassins. I thought Liam Neelson was great as Collins and so was the 'supporting' cast, with the exception of Julia Roberts. I don't think you can help but make comparisons between this movie and Braveheart. While I was watching it, I imagined Collins being the modern day Irish equivalent of that old Scottish hero. <br /> <br />As other reviewers have mentioned, if you want to know more about the history of this struggle, it would be best to hit the history books rather than the play button. But if you want an entertaining film that gives you a rough idea of who Michael Collins was and what he stood for; this is as good a film as any.  <br />

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have only seen the first cd of this show and I already am in love with it. I can't wait until I can see the next bit!!  <br />I knew about the show through Buffy and seeing things occasionally on sites about Joss working on it, but I never saw it or really gave it any thought. Fox made a huge mistake in canceling it and when my friend mentioned to me a few weeks ago that he owned the dvd set and that it was really good I was more than willing to see it. It turned out to exceed all my expectations; I recommend this to everyone!!
B00008EY65|5.0|I do not have alot of time to right but if you want more info look at other reviews.There are a ton of extra features that are preatty good.There are extras on the 1st and 2nd disc.And in my opinion the movie is 5 stars and an A-.It's a preatty solid action movie.Oh and by the way the reason that some of the effects look bad is because they arent CGI.They usualyy have wires attached to them.Oh yeah and the fight with those squid things arent CGI unless there are things not good enough for a person to do.BYE!!!
0553208845|4.0|I read this book after I heared so much about it, how it was Hesse's greatest work, etc. I had read &quot;Narcissus and Goldmund&quot; and was blown away, absolutely loved it. When I read &quot;Siddhartha&quot; I was first taken back and didn't think it was such a great book or a great story. But it really is a book that you can fly through, read in one day, and not think much of it. But if you go beneath the layers, take it apart, and really see it for what it is, it can be brilliant. I think a lot of people find something different in this book, that's what might make it so popular, that basically everyone analyses this book differently, depending on where they are at in their lifes. I am glad I read it and have it in the back of my mind lots of times. It's like a guide, a god story, a comforting read, and a good friend. I might think about it very differently if I reread it in a couple of years.

B000002HH9|5.0|This album is definitley different. The proof is obviously in the pudding...but so what? Its The Cure and it is still musically enchanting. I admit I dont like The 13th and one or two other tracks but other than that it is a very good album. Its unfortunate that thier 2004 album is not as good as this or others....This is a Lie, Want, and Jupiter Crash alone make this album worth owning...I mean come on man! Those songs are done in original Cure fashion with a newer twist...I'm not saying to like it just because it is The Cure....But have an open mind and digest the music and you will realize that Its still The Cure at heart..a wonderful, melodic rock band that we have always loved and will love until the day we die.....The Cure will be with me on my deathbed...I promise you that.
B000286S8S|3.0|To you rocket scientists : What do you mean a waste of $20 ??? What the hell did you think you were buying ? Even VH can't prevent consumers from being stupid. Maybe the real waste was all the money spent on your post secondary education, pal.       Anyway, this disc is what it is. Three undistinguished new songs and a bunch of retreads getting the third or fourth go 'round. Yes it's designed to fill up everyone's    ( including Roth's ) pockets one more time, but I own all the studio discs, including the previous \\"Best Of\\", so what do I care ?     Note to Warner Brothers : Instead of continuing to grossly overcharge for the DLR era VH discs, why not put them out on a 2 for 1 format. These are so short that you could even do 3 for 1 with the first VH trifecta ! It's downright criminal to charge $17.99 for a 30 minute disc that is 25 years old. This is the REAL reason the major labels are dying a slow death: they're unremittingly greedy and short sighted opportunists. It has nothing to do with WWW downloads.
B00023BLXK|5.0|A true to story based on a woman's experiences when her father was transferred to Havana, Cuba at the age of 16 a short time prior to Cuban revolution in which Batista was overthrown by Fidel Castro.  Okay so Romola Garai was a bit stiff at times but hey the dancing was SO INCREDIBLE!!!!  Diego Luna and Romola Garai are a perfect match, in terms of dancing, to this untrained (well at least in terms of Ballroom dancing which is completely different than the types of dancing I learned!) eye.  What added to the movies complete success were the costumes, which were beautiful 50's period pieces, as well as the music which was a mixture of pure Cubano music, Afro-Cubano music, and what sounded like some modern version of Cubano music.  Maya's song was to die for, but I can't say that there wasn't a single song contained in this movie that I did not enjoy!  Any woman or girl on the verge of womanhood should be so lucky to experience a romantic interlude such as this one!  I like this better than the original Dirty Dancing...speaking of which for you Patrick Swayze fans, he plays a brief role in this movie as (What Else..) the hotel's dance instructor, with (I believe) the woman who played the nymphomaniac in the original movie!!!  Sigh what more could a girl ask for?!
B000003BDJ|5.0|While I am writing a review of this two-CD collection of classic early Stones tracks, Hot Rocks 1964-1971 basically sells itself.  You get all of the best songs from one of rock's most successful, long-established groups.  These songs are probably older than Keith Richards' wife, but they still stand head and shoulders above most of the music released in the last three decades.  On most retrospective collections, people look down the track list and ask why is that song on here or say they don't even remember this or that track.  Not so with the Stones' Hot Rocks - each of the 21 song titles is immediately recognizable.<br /><br />It's great to hear some of the really classic songs any time you want.  I'm actually rather sick of Satisfaction because that sometimes seems to be the only Stones track the deejays think they can play.  It's a great song, but it's far from the Stones' best.  I'll take Paint It Black any day of the week - this song has a uniquely haunting quality that reaches out and grabs you, and many may remember how it was used to perfection in the film Full Metal Jacket.  CD number one has a great mix of fast and slow songs: Jagger gets mellow on the likes of Time Is On My Side, Play With Fire, and As Tears Go By, but the truly memorable songs are rocking tracks such as Get Off of My Cloud, Mother's Little Helper, and 19th Nervous Breakdown.  CD number two finds the guys a little farther along in their careers, and it's not hard to hear the maturity of the sound as the Stones' begin experimenting with different styles and adding an unquantifiable sense of polish to their work.  Jumping Jack Flash, Sympathy For the Devil, Honky Tonk Women, Brown Sugar - we all know and love these.  I'm actually fonder of the tracks that get a little less attention, though: Street Fighting Man, Gimme Shelter, You Can't Always Get What You Want, and Wild Horses.  I only have one little complaint: Midnight Rambler (the only live song included here) just seems to have pretty poor sound quality.<br /><br />If you've read this far, you'll realize that all I'm really doing is telling you what songs are on Hot Rocks 1964-1971 - that's really all you need to know.  If the titles alone don't convince you to buy this collection, nothing I say here will show you the error of your ways, either.tty poor sound quality.   <br /> <br />If you've read this far, you'll realize that all I'm really doing is telling you what songs are on Hot Rocks 1964-1971 - that's really all you need to know.

B00028HBKM|5.0|As a Jesus lover, my favorite movie is Jesus of Nazareth. A movie that doesn't have to be done again, Zefirelli did a Masterpiece. What Mel Gibson  brought, though, is immeasurable !  Why ? Because the only part in Jesus of Nazareth that was very good but could have gone deeper, in terms of realness, was the last days. Not because Zefirelli could have done better but more because now we are so use to violence that the end of Jesus of Nazareth doesn't touch us as much as it did. Many suggest that it is only a violent movie. It is true that if you can't very gently let it pierce you as you experience such pain, this movie is not for you yet, it wouldn't help anything. This movie is for those who are able to Be with pain as is. He give a awesome example when he talks to Mary as he transports his cross. Most beautiful !
B0000640VN|4.0|&quot;Kate and Leopold&quot; is a routine, by-the-numbers, fish-out-of-water romantic comedy. Fans of Robert Altman's &quot;The Player,&quot; can easily imagine the &quot;pitch&quot; scene where &quot;Kate and Leopold&quot; got sold to the studio -- &quot;It's a romantic comedy involving time travel and a satire on the soulless world of advertising, but it's got a heart -- I see Hugh Jackman and Meg Ryan -- it's &quot;When Harry Met Sally&quot; meets &quot;Time After Time,&quot; but it's got a heart.&quot; &quot;Sold!&quot; <br />  <br /> Since there are virtually no surprises in store for the audience, such formulas rely almost exclusively on the talent of the players, and &quot;K&L&quot; gives good cast. Meg Ryan (Kate) is Meg Ryan, queen of the romantic comedy (although she almost seems impatient with this movie). Liev Schreiber has some fun Keystone Kop-ish scenes as Kate's ex-boyfriend. Breckin Meyer merrily tags along as Kate's little brother, a struggling actor. And Bradley Whitford hits some good notes as Kate's obnoxious boss. <br />  <br /> But the real star of the flick is Hugh Jackman as Leopold. Living in New York of 1862, Leopold yearns to be a man of accomplishment but is confined by position and (lack of) purse to be a mere gentleman, condemned to marry for money to preserve his family's station. Enviously watching the engineer Washington Roebling brag about his mammoth achievement, building the Brooklyn Bridge (&quot;the greatest erection on the planet!&quot;), Leopold notices Stuart snapping pictures with a small camera. Does the film ask why only Leopold notices a man in 21st century attire using a tiny camera? No -- &quot;K&L&quot; uses time travel as a mere excuse to get a love interest to NYC for Meg Ryan and some fish-out-of-water comedy. <br />  <br /> Stuart accidentally brings Leopold back to the modern age and, his use to the plot virtually complete, is sidelined through a hilarious elevator accident. Leopold, left to fend for himself, quickly accepts the fact that he has breached the space-time continuum and becomes part of Kate's life. <br />  <br /> Kate, who naturally can't stand Leopold at first, is a harried advertising executive whose boss (Whitford) wants to seduce even though Kate &quot;knows women, but is not of them.&quot; Kate's big project is to pitch a horrible butter substitute. And who could possibly be a better pitchman for butter substitutes than a transplant from the 19th century? <br />  <br /> As stated before, the film has no surprises -- you will not be surprised that Leopold chases down a purse snatcher on horseback in Central Park, because anyone from the 19th century must be a master horseman, even if he's a frustrated NYC nobleman with dreams of building an elevator.  <br />  <br /> But it is undeniable that Jackman and Ryan have some chemistry, and Jackman imbues Leopold with sufficient gravitas and humor to sustain this silly plot.  <br />  <br /> This is not a great romantic comedy, but it is a good one. But while it's fun to see Jackman successfully step outside of his Wolverine/Van Helsing action persona, &quot;K&L&quot; also proves that it's about time Meg Ryan left this genre behind.

0060922583|5.0|Upon purchasing this book, I expected a completely scientific approach and explanation of the holographic universe premise in relation to quantum physics. Talbot does explain the premise thoroughly and in an ease-to-understand way right off, but it does stray from what I -- and probably most readers -- expected. That is, more quantum theory and less of how the holographic premise related to real-world encounters with the paranormal, \\"miracles,\\" and the unexplained in general. The strong relationship between the quantum and metaphysical was concluded more through speculation than scientific process. Of course there is no other way to draw that conclusion. No study in a lab or otherwise can prove so, but the circumstantial evidence is certainly convincing.<br /><br />There are many fascinating instances on record by researchers and scientists throughout history that Talbot makes reference to, and they are one of the reasons I personally enjoyed this book. Each record should be taken with a grain of salty skepticism, however (Sai Baba). I've always enjoyed reading about such miraculous events from Edgar Cayce, to Don Juan, to Yogananda, and this book runs the gamut. I wish I discovered this book earlier for that reason, but it wasn't why I initially bought it and obviously why other reviewers hated it. It was a misconception of what this book actually covers.<br /><br />There are certainly truths contained in Talbot's book that cannot be denied (though I'm sure there are those who will). One, that scientists can often be biased toward outcomes by their own ingrained belief systems. Two, that human consciousness affects matter. Three, there is currently no other scientific model of the universe that comes close to formulating logical approaches to phenomena such as stigmata, near death experiences, miracle healings, and so on.<br /><br />In conclusion, for those who have a curious mind and search for a new perception of the world we live in, then Talbot's book will surely give you another option. While this isn't your standard scientific fare, it is a well-thought out and thought-provoking work complete with annotations to references used and is probably as \\"scientific\\" as you can get when talking about quantum physics and its explanation of the unexplainable.l surely give you another option. While this isn't your standard scientific fare, it is a well-thought out and thought-provoking work complete with annotations to references used and is probably as \\"scientific\\" as you can get when talking about quantum physics and its explanation of the unexplainable.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Why? Why why why why why? I could write that another hundred times, but I'll shorten it up and say, do not rent this. Do not buy this. Do not tell other people it is good, because it is not. This was the biggest waste of time that I can recall. I truly can't think of a worse movie off the top of my head, besides possibly &quot;Tank Girl.&quot; When movies like this get nominated, I just wonder how and why? What is good about this movie? Could Francis Ford Coppola's influence really be so great that he could get his daughter nominated as best director for such a blatant piece of garbage such as this? The movie is slow, not funny, nothing happens. The only thing that makes this movie good is when the credits roll around, because you'll realize that you haven't died and gone to hell and aren't forced to watch this for eternity...luckily it does end, and you'll be thankful it does.

B00005JN2F|4.0|Cubby Broccoli started it with James Bond films. Changing directors all the time is one of the ways they have been able to keep James Bond fresh and contemporary, preventing the series from falling into a repetitive pattern. <br /> <br />I assume that was the reason Doug Liman didn't direct this part two of the Bourne saga and passed the megaphone to Paul Greengrass.  <br /> <br />All things considered I think the story would have been better with Limans style. Liman put togther a wonderful story that revealed the mystery in a way the always left more questions to come. The action sequences were fast, brutal and believable. <br /> <br />Greengrass in my opinion relied to heavily on hand held cameras during most of the action scenes and even quite a few non-action scenes. I have no objection to use of the &quot;shaky cam&quot; but like a spice, it can be over used and ruin the effect. Instead of connecting the audience to the action overuse of the shaky-cam, made it difficult to follow much of the action.  <br /> <br />Most of chase scene had the camera basically in the passenger seat next to Bourne and it moved about so much the audience missed most of the best parts of the action. <br /> <br />Overall the movie was well done, but would have been much much better with Liman back at the helm. In the case of the Bourne movies, I think consistency would be better especially considering how good the first film really was. <br /> <br />Other areas of detail were very good. The bombs used to blow up the electrical panels would most likely have been Semtex in a real mission and the prop bombs had a Semtex like color and texture. I though that was a nice touch. I do appeciate details done correctly. <br /> <br />On the other hand, Greengrass used the TV show style silencer sound (the tweeter). That was just laziness considering how the original film went to lengths to use a more realistic sound effect when Conklin received his &quot;payoff&quot; at the end. <br /> <br />Matt Damon again brought a strong performance to the role of Bourne thus cementing his claim to being a credible action star. Brian Cox came very close to stealing the show with his portrayal of Abbott and Joan Allen was well cast as Pam Landry. It was even nice to see snippets Tom Gallop as Conkin here and there. I'll miss Franke Potente in subsequent films hoping maybe they'll do a soap-opera deal, after all there was no body.... <br /> <br />This was a good film but disappointing in two respects. The story was no where near as interesting as the first movie. I would be willing to beet that more than half of the audience in the theater didn't even understand the whole plot even after it had been revealed. That and the overly shaky camera work detracted from what could have been a 5-star film.
0316168815|4.0|The Lovely Bones is a book with an unusual premise. In the 1970's, a fourteen year-old girl is raped and murdered by a neighbor. Susie's murder goes unsolved, her killer goes unpunished, her parents' marriage falls apart. Unbeknownst to those still on Earth, Susie watches everything, hears all from Heaven. I use the term Heaven loosely, because Sebold has no reference to God, Jesus, or angels. There are counselors, and it is a pleasant place except that Susie is helpless to intervene with affairs on Earth. She can only watch.<br /><br />The lives of those she left behind unfold. One of the most interesting characters is Ruana Singh, the mother of Ray Singh, a boy who had a crush on Susie. Ruana adds a much-needed splash of color to the otherwish pallid cast and setting of the book.<br /><br />The Lovely Bones is a good story. The reader easily gets wrapped up in it. The curious voyeuristic sensation is a pleasant reading experience. Recommended for ages 14 and up for some disturbing or graphic scenes such as her rape and the dismemberment of her body, marijuana use, and sex between minors.
B000003C5C|4.0|This aslbum is incredible! everything about it is top notch. The only reason I did not give it five stars is that the lyrics hear are gore metal lyrics and do not delve into the deeper philosophical and social issues discussed on later albums. But the music is intense, possible Death's most brutal work. If you want a talentaed and intelligent death metal, listen to Death! The passing of Chuck is a terrible tragedy; we have lost death metal's greatest thinker. But through the music and the new fans that can't help but be won, his legacy shall remain. Death Forever!!!!!!!

Then we got a good trilogy arc with; The Wrath of Khan, The Search For Spock and finally The Voyage Home.   <br /> <br />One thing about this film, is the fact that you don't have to be a Trekkie to watch it.  It has Whales.  People love Whales.  It's written by Nicholas Meyer too.  Out of the three chapters in this trilogy, I choose The Voyage Home as my favoite.  It's better than The Wrath of Khan and Search For Spock put together . . .

0380789019|5.0|Neil Gaiman, familiar to me only for his Sandman comics... I had heard that he had written a few novels, but the thought never occured to me to check any of them out until a few days ago. <br />  <br /> I picked up Neverwhere expecting a heavy read. I did not expect the book to be as captivating as it was. Perhaps a modern day Alice in Wonderland (read: Alice In London) this book is full of characters and places that not only do you get to know in depth, but can also visualize due to the great descriptions that Neil Gaiman has provided. I've noticed that in many books, when you are given a description of a location, many times the authors become extremely long winded and drab. This is not one of those books. I can not tell you how long it has been where I did not want a story to end because it was so good. <br />  <br /> This book follows Richard Mayhew, a regular guy whom seems to be a bit of a patsy. A good guy, just soft. He helps an injured girl out and that begins his decent into &quot;London Underground&quot;. A world of lost dreams and past lives, where people and places have fallen thru the cracks and keep on falling away from society and into a new world of sorts. This world has everything that a &quot;hidden world&quot; needs; heros and villians, love and betrayal, and even a little humor thrown in for good measure. There is adventure and excitement and a number of twists thrown in. All I can really suggest is that if you are even remotely interested in the plot of this book, pick it up, I guarentee that you won't be able to put it down.
0783233477|3.0|Meet Joe Black is the story of media uber-tycoon Anthony Hopkins who meets Death, played by Brad Pitt.  In exchange for showing him a little of ordinary life, Pitt promises Hopkins some more precious time.  Hopkins has two grown daughters.  Death falls for one of them.  The plot would have been great for a 1940's comedy.  The fairly explicit sex scene makes MJB a movie you can't see with your kids or mom.<br /><br />Despite absolutely superb, supreme performances by Pitt and Hopkins, and a not-bad one from a guy who looks just like Dr. Phil, the film moves at an excruciatingly slow pace.  Wanting to know what will happen keeps the viewer from giving up.  I don't direct movies, but I feel character development and portrayal can be done well at a faster pace.<br /><br />Suffering through the long scenes of all the characters staring into each other's eyes, the viewer sits bolt upright at a classic line delivered by Pitt towards the end of the film.  It is worth sitting through this just for that three-word line!
B0000UJL96|5.0|Originally, I would've gave this film 4 stars to keep The Final Frontier in positive territory.  But after viewing it again, I must admit it's better than 5.  Not only that, but it's a great send off for the crew . . . Boldly Going Where No Man, No One Has Gone Before . . .
B000022TSV|5.0|After reading  'The Sun Also Rises' I thought of Carmen as a follow up to my curiosities of the cultures in Spain.  Although this story was reconstituted by a French composer, I saw this as a Spanish story and who doesn't like the story of falling obsessively in love with a wild temptress to the brink of insane jealousy.  But with that said you're probably not here just to learn about the story because you can just look it up somewhere else nor should take my word with how the performers performed because there are critics out there that probably have a better understanding of what makes a singer better technically than the other.  I think this movie is good because of how the movie was shot on location in Spain.  The movie shot on location in various locations of the town with the tobacco factory and the fortress where the soldiers were stationed.  Also the dance sequences and costumes of the actors were pretty good in depicting the free spiritedness of the gypsies in the gypsy song segment as well as the procession of the matadors in the final act of the movie. <br /> <br />All in all a great first for learning about telling a story in song.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|I wish that I had written my review earlier. There are so many things that I want to say about this album that have probably already been said (over 500 reviews already!). Ok, screw it. I'll just say what I want anyway. Haha!<br /> This is definitely a rocker of an album. Although DT is a prog-rock band, they have always been influenced by the heavier side of metal. Pantera, Napalm Death and early Metallica to name a few. On this one, it sure shows. They have found a way to combine power and loads of distortion with complex riffs, odd time signatures and melodic, catchy vocals. Here's a break down:<br /><br />#1 - As I am - Great opening track. Starts out slow and moody and then picks up the tempo to make for a heavy, crunching tune. The lyrics are a rebellious stand against conformity. A very well written song in all.<br /><br />#2 - This Dying Soul - This one isn't one of the heavier tracks, but it's a good one nonetheless. As is typical of DT, it starts out completely different from where it ends up. I thought the intro and verse were ok, but the chorus and ending did it for me. The bridge about midway reminded me of Metallica's Blackened. Then, at the very end, John Petrucci sounds like he went on speed, even for him. Check it out!<br /><br />#3 - Endless Sacrifice - Probably the most musically diverse track on the disc, this is a rather lengthy 10min+ epic. The intro and verse are slow and very melodic, up until the chorus. Then, the song picks up with a heavy riff and doesn't slow back down. I really like the transition at the end from instrumental back into vocals. Very cool stuff here.<br /><br />#4 - Honor thy Father - Starts with a very cool drum intro and then goes into a syncopated guitar riff. From then on, the song stays pretty constant, without much variation. One of the heavier and cooler tracks. I especially liked the chorus. The instrumental stuff at the end was subpar for DT, but still a very good track.<br /><br />#5 - Vacant - Honestly, I usually skip over this one. I'm not too much into ballads, especially when there's no change and it sounds like a droning effort to just put something different on the album. This is the Space Dye Vest of this disc.<br /><br />#6 - Stream of Consciousness - Normally, I'm into DT's instrumentals. In this case, I found myself bored and disinterested in this track. Maybe they set the bar too high with Erotomania and Dance of Eternity, but this one failed to keep it flowing.<br /><br />#7 - In the Name of God - Another long one. I really liked this track. It rocks and then it slows down for a moody, heartfelt chorus. It ranks up there with Endless Sacrifice as a diverse track. DT nicely rounds the disc out with a great show of musicianship.<br /><br />In a nutshell, there were 2 tracks I was disappointed with, but the rest really made up for it. A very solid album by the prog masters.<br /><br />Now that I've said what I needed to about the album, I want to take a little more time to address some of the critics. First, it doesn't matter how long they take in the writing process. Remember, Liquid Tension is all spontaneous. Maybe they didn't want to (or couldn't) take too much time before recording. Songs do sound a lot different in the studio than on your rig at home. Also, stop comparing this to their old albums. It's one thing to reference their old material to make a point, but it's another thing to use it as a base for how you're judging the new album. Musicians have to grow and go in different directions from time to time. They're still Dream Theater. Also, I disagree with the people that say this album is sloppy and not well done. They did stuff on this album that they've never done before. You have to try new things. I'm sure you don't want a clone of Images and Words being put out again and again. Don't worry, I don't think they're gonna pull another black album on us.<br /><br />Well, I've said my peace. DT is one of my favorite bands and this album is further testimony to that declaration. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of those 2 tracks. But, it's still a must listen for any DT or prog-metal or any metal fan.

B0000AUHOH|4.0|I think this film is entertaining, as well as low budget.  Like with Planet Of The Apes, the fifth chapter goes a little down hill.  William Shatner's original treatment would've been better though.  I'm not religious, but the idea of bible myth is fascinating. My biggest problem with this film is the invention of Spock's half brother, a cousin would be more believable! Unfortunately, Bill Shatner wasn't able to make his Director's Edition . . .
B000002JST|5.0|Let me begin my review with the following question.  Who in their right mind calls 'Hell Ain't A Bad Place To Be' filler?? This is one of the most beloved AC/DC songs, and is a prime example of Bon Scott's lyrical genius. <br />  <br />This album is home to four of AC/DC's concert staples: 'Hell Ain't A Bad Place To Be', 'Bad Boy Boogie', 'Whole Lotta Rosie', and of course, 'Let There Be Rock'. It would be a great purchase for not just the casual AC/DC fan, but the casual rock 'n' roll fan as well. <br />  <br />I would also encourage anyone who enjoys this album to purchase the Australian (original) version which contains 'Crabsody In Blue' instead of 'Problem Child'.
6304712944|4.0|WARNING: I saw Camelot as a child when it was first released-it made an impression. I then read the OFK by T.H. WHITE in one day and wrote an honors thesis on the development of the Arthurian legend in college. So yes,the story had some resonance for me. But why do I think Camelot works, whereas Excalibur, the latest King Arthur film and all the earlier films don't really? Because Camelot remembers 1)That audiences are more interested in people (character(s)) than plot. The people NOT the battles, NOT the magic, NOT the SPFX. (See why Spiderman2 works, or LOTR) And (2)Camelot is the ONLY version of the story that had a TRIANGLE--where 3 people care about each other EQUALLY, yet it still breaks. And the only way you get that tragedy is if both Guenevere and Lancelot love Arthur as much as they love each other. Otherwise it's just another adulterous affair, and Arthur is a cuckold we don't give a damn about.     Re production: The sets were not cardboard. They filmed on-location in Spain at Coca, Alcazar of Segovia etc. etc.  Warners backlot built actual bricks/morter castle courtyard & real forest.
B00004XONN|5.0|For a band so uninterested in the visuals of its members, and so stark in its performance, it is simply amazing how unable to hear Radiohead's music both critics and punters have found it. A book could be written on the history of misunderstandings between journalists and Radiohead and misleading marketing campaigns.<br /><br /> Radiohead are not balladeers of depression and apathy---not makers of \\"music to slit your wrists to\\", as early critics had it---but authentic documentarians of dread and free-floating anxiety. Their vitality is sparked by outrage, even disgust, not rapture, at the insignificance of the inhabitants of contemporary democracies. Sure you can vote, but will your vote even be counted? Where to turn when your candidate or political party does not represent your views?<br /><br /> \\"I laugh until my head comes off\\" are the words of a man unhinged with bitterness and despair. This is the nanosecond before the bomb goes off. 'Idioteque' is one of the most authentically frightening songs of recent years: if the university-educated, politically-engaged Radiohead of Oxford can't see a way out, then maybe we really are in irretrievable trouble. ('Morning Bell' isn't much less spooky, with singer and lyricist Thom Yorke chanting 'walking, walking, walking' in the background and sounding like Jack Nicholson in 'The Shining'.)<br /><br /> 'Idioteque' also seems to satirize the worst failure of the other greatest band in the world: U2 and their ghastly, pointless \\"Discotheque\\". Maybe Radiohead aren't so ethereal and oblivious to competition as they let on?<br /><br /> \\"Ice age coming/ women and children first/ We're not scaremongering/ this is really happening\\". No kidding, pal. Yorke has an astonishing capacity for telescoping a series of thoughts, whether a wad of newspaper editorials or an avalanche of scholarship. \\"Ice age coming/let me hear both sides\\" drops out the central referent (the debate between the GOP versus the rest of the educated world about the existence of global warming) while remaining entirely comprehensible.<br /><br /> Sure, Yorke will toss in the odd bizarro word (\\"Myxomatosis\\"---a form of rabbit disease---is the title of one (dance) song on \\"Hail to the Thief\\"), but Radiohead, for all their poly sci readings, are hugely less pretentious than Sting, who cannot stop praising himself for reading \\"Lolita\\", or even Bono, for all his good intentions (indeed, one might argue that the intentions---to deliver the world on Judgement Day---are the problem).<br /><br /> Yorke studs the vocals with disarticulated vocal units, true music, virtually plainsong. Sometimes he communicates with words, sometimes with vocal effect alone. This type of modesty is worthy of some contemplation. (The track 'Treefingers' is even instrumental.) Yorke develops a trend Kurt Cobain revived from authentic punk: sing your lyrics with such utter passion, that they become indecipherable. Sure, something is lost (the explicit verbal text), but there is no denying something is gained when the human voice screams, wails and cries in a palette of colours almost unknown outside a locked unit.<br /><br /> Significantly, Yorke, who fussily oversees the production of beautiful CD booklets of original art for each album, has not reproduced 'Kid A''s lyrics, having grown frustrated with verses being studied in isolation from the total sound. But what about a rare, crystal-clear line in \\"How to disappear completely\\" like \\"float down the Liffey\\". That's not just any old river: that's Joycean territory you've dived into.<br /><br /> \\"There are two colours in my head/ what was it that you tried to say?\\" captures in a mere couplet what it took U2 an entire album (\\"Zooropa\\") to communicate: the simple inability to hear a single meaningful thing in the babble and Babel of multichannel, surround sound culture.<br /><br /> Beyond immediately calling to mind a Rothko or Barnett Newman, the listener understands that the two colours either clash violently or can scarcely be distinguished, and the mental gymnastics instantly kick in. Yorke is very consciously twisting the radio knobs in your head, as a technician of synaesthesia.<br /><br /> Instead of an unambiguous forward move in a rock vein, which much of the industry had expected, Radiohead opted for an immensely ambitious lateral move into a form of electronica sometimes denigrated as mere esoterica. \\"Kid A\\" refused to function as \\"OK Computer Redux\\". This did not generate universal praise; many critics saw a dodge, a stumble or even a feint, and longstanding (and accurate) rumours of Yorke's writer's block and excruciatingly slow recording sessions in Paris, Copenhagen and the UK did not bode well for the release. Radiohead seemed ready to lose their mass audience fast upon assembling it with &quot;OK Computer&quot;.<br /><br /> Thom Yorke is said to have initially stumped (and frightened) some members his four-guitar, one drum band with an abrupt fascination with electronica like Aphex Twin and Autechre (whom Yorke name-checks in every interview), causing the other members to reconsider their potential input with Kid A. Lead guitarist Johnny Greenwood is another incessant experimentalist, responsible here for instruments as diverse as the theremin and the Ondes Martenot. Production took a queer turn for a rock band. The title song \\"Kid A\\" would emerge from a computer program Yorke wrote. \\"Everything in its Right Place\\" would employ a 10/4 time signature. Not every player would play on each song. Some contributions were silent.<br /><br /> Titles like \\"Treefingers\\" and \\"Idioteque\\" are initially fearsome, bringing to mind singularly inaccessible experimental music: spookily incoherent like Miles Davis's \\"Tutu\\". But \\"The National Anthem\\" explodes into throbbing bass and horns in a kind of Merz-jazz, a caterwaul and feedback rapture.<br /><br /> But Radiohead got their dance sound and bent their mental universe around it. \\"The National Anthem\\" has such a heavy, superb beat while voicing such bleakness that it might be best to dance to it in ESL. As music to crash your car to, however, that and \\"Idioteque\\" can't be beat.

B0000683DH|5.0|This Sequel, to the episode Space Seed, remains one of the most favorite chapters in the Star Trek Universe.  And now they're making a prequel episode on Enterprise.  If that doesn't bring fans back, I don't know what will.    Anyway, this is Nicholas Meyer second film.  The first is the time travel classic; Time After Time.  It's obvious why fans love his Star Trek films.  It's the storytelling!  He's great with material.  And getting an extended edition of The Wrath of Khan isn't a bad idea either . . .
B000002BYD|5.0|As many would proclaim Vs. or Vitalogy the best follow up to Ten, their self proclaimed landmark, I do not concur. Listening to Yield, I'm fully aware of what a real follow up album is like, and this is it. Yield is thee follow up to Ten and probably Pearl Jam's pinnacle masterpiece.<br /><br />  With the single, 'Do The Evolution', Vedder takes us into the wrongs and common cliches of mankind and the history of life. It's a song that's enriched with lyrics that border those of 'Sympathy for the Devil', a song I consider the most well written song, ever. 'Evolution' is easily one of Pearl Jam's more memorable songs, but it's not even the best of Yield.<br /><br />  Anyone who listens to 'In Hiding', surely knows that Pearl Jam is a band of high talent. It's distinguishable opening lick takes you in and never lets you go, with a song so touching, it takes us back to something like say, 'Black'...or even 'Better Man.' 'Given to Fly' is just that thrilling, as well, rounding out the better edges in the album.<br /><br />  But rocking hard and bringing us to that 'Even Flow', 'Animal' daze of the band, songs like 'Brain of J' keep us moving, and so does 'Faithful' and the out of the stadium drive, 'Wishlist.' The songs are so intriguing, and while not hits like those off of Ten, these seem to stick with you more. In my opinion, that tells how important the song really is, and it's value.<br /><br />  Being said, Pearl Jam filed some sci-fi with Binaural, and became politicians with Riot Act more recently. But if you ask me, I'd say this is their better album to date and probably in their entire catalog. I'd buy this before Ten, just because it's more deserving, in my opinion and don't get me wrong, I love Ten, I just appreciate this more. Hopefully, you'll understand now how great this album is.<br /><br />  Ah what the hell, pick this up along with Ten, you're now a fan.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I read most of the reviews on this site before I went out and got this album.. Being a huge fan of their work since the beginning I wasn't sure what to expect with the amount of belly-aching that was going on... <br />THANK GOD!!! I went out and got it... This album is the first real Slipknot album... By that I mean it was the first album that they wrote and recorded as a band...  <br />As for the production... COME ON!!! It's Rick Rubin not Bob Rock... This isn't Metallica's Load...!!! Nor is this a Stone Sour record... Anyone who thinks it is needs to actually listen to Stone Sour... They sound nothing like this even though Corey and Jim are two of the members!!  <br />This album will become a classic in a few years, it will allow the band to add a new mix to the live show, and will hopefully shut the mouths of some of the critics who say this is a noise band...
B000286RKW|5.0|Finally! I've never bought GOODFELLAS on DVD because a film this great deserved far more than just throwing the film on a disc to get it out there. I'm thrilled to see it on a 2-disc set.<br /><br /> The three great Mafia movies are THE GODFATHER, GODFATHER II and GOODFELLAS. They make up a trilogy that covers the mob from its beginnings in America up to the 1980's when, fulfilling Vito Corleone's prophecy, &quot;this drug business will be the end of us.&quot;<br /><br /> Are there other good Mafia movies? Sure.<br /><br /> But these three are firing on every single piston.<br /><br /> Pure classics.
B0002JJBZE|5.0|I agree!  It has some of my favorite episodes; Assignment: Earth, Amok Time, The Immunity Syndrome, A Piece of the Action and The Trouble With Tribbles.    Like season one, I assume, these are in air date order.  So pay close attention to Chekov's hair . . .
B00006879E|1.0|A masterpiece of inane songwriting and a prime example of why it's going to take a lot more than a few nostalgic bands like Jet and The Strokes to - as the critics are so fond of saying - &quot;save rock.&quot; Songs About Jane is hands-down the most irritating album I have ever had the dipleasure to listen to. Thank Jesus and all of his apostles that I didn't actually purchase this apallingly bad album; I was forced to listen through it twice in a friend's friend's car. <br />  <br /> The lead singer's voice is annoying as hell, and the songs are unvaried and unimaginative poppy fake-love songs for women (or men, in the interest of being an equal-opportunity stereotypist) who read trashy romance novels with titles like &quot;Charmed and Dangerous&quot; and &quot;Slightly Sinful.&quot; <br />  <br /> If that describes you, God help you, you'll probably really, really like Songs About Jane. If you've just wrinkled your nose in utter revulsion, leave this page NOW and search for something - anything - else. The artist would pretty much have to be conciously trying to make it worse than this.
B000007177|4.0|Tull's 2-disk set 'NightCap' is an excellent find for any Jethro Tull fan. It's like coming away with two new albums for the price of one! Disk one, is the 'Chateau D'Isaster Tapes', which if you were lucky enough to get the 20 Year Box Set you already own. This is the album that should have come out when Tull released 'Passion Play'. And you will hear many elements of 'Passion Play' throughout 'Chateau'. 'Sealion 2' and the opening instrumentals are personal faves from this disk. They have a 'Warchild' or 'Minstrel In the Gallery' feel, as does 'Critque Oblique'. 'Solitaire' even pops up here. If you like 70's Tull and you didn't know about these songs, then this is a must have. Definately a 3 star disk.<br /><br /> The second disk is the reason to buy this set though. No matter what era of Tull you are a fan of, you will find at least 1 to 2 songs represented on this disk. It's an eclectic mix of left overs from Tull recording sessions through the years. But these aren't just shoddy demo's or filler songs that Tull pulled together for a quick release. Most of these songs are as good, if not better than the songs which were finally selected for the albums. It's kind of cool, as a Tull fan, to hear familiar guitar chords, or flute lines, from Tull albums worked in a new way on some of the songs. Ian Anderson and company really shine on the acoustic songs featured on this disk. 'Quartet' is a neat little instrumental that could have been inserted into most of the 70's Tull releases. 'Truck Stop Runner' sounds like one of Tull's 80's synth tunes, stripped down to basics, and adds a bit of Country music flair to create a unique Tull song. 'Paradise Steakhouse' is an older song, but seems like it would have fit right in on 'Catfish Rising' or 'Rock Island', while 'Rosa On the Factory Floor' has a 'Crest of a Knave' feel.<br /><br /> 'Nightcap' is a nice snapshot of Tull's musical journey through the past 3 decades, and worthy of adding to your Tull collection.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|I can't believe that there are people in this world that think that St Anger is better than Rust in Peace. Things like that make me feel like giving up on humanity and sticking a fork in my eye. Rust in Peace is an absolute masterpiece in metal, but I guess the high level of musicality it contains makes it less accessible to the average person. However, Megadeth are and probably always will be the most underrated Heavy Metal band of all time. I just hope that people like you, Frank, are few and far between. By the way, Dave Mustaine writes some of the most kickarse riffs of all time, and the riffs on this album are one hundred times better than those on St Anger. Justice has been served, my work here is done.
B00006G8HX|5.0|Spock is missing, and the rest of our crew must find him.    Leonard Nimoy picks off where The Wrath of Khan left off.  This also includes the new and improved Klingons, which we got a glimpse of during the Motion Picture.  We get the second chance to see a Klingon female.  And this film brings back classic material from TOS.    Unintentionally, this film, with Wrath of Khan, became part of a trilogy of trek films with the next chapter; The Voyage Home . . .
B00003CXCT|4.0|Aside from the fact that George Lucas seems to have insulated himself from his filmmaking roots (an anything goes guerrilla-style filmmaking he learned from Francis Ford Coppola and utilized in his first features right up to and including the very first Star Wars film (no, I don't mean Episode \\"Yippie!\\" 1)) and listens only to a small cadre of technicians that probably act as his \\"yes men,\\" aside from the fact that Lucas feels the need to go back and tinker like crazy with his original trilogy of films (tinker all you want with Return of the Jedi, my friend... but why couldn't you leave the first two, classics in their own right, alone??), aside from the fact that he utterly blew a chance at making the Star Wars universe stronger and better in terms of story, plot and characterization in order to achieve new heights in (so what!) CGI special effects, and aside from the fact that George Lucas cares not for the blowback of fan criticism in regards to Episode 1 (The Phantom Menace indeed) and that truly awful character, Jar-Jar Binks... aside from all those issues that make being a fan of Star Wars in the 21st century so darn difficult (and make being a fan of Peter Jackson's efforts in bringing the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy to the screen so darned easy), aside from all of that... we are still left with some truly great filmmaking, some truly great characters (and, while not truly great, some of the best known acting choices for a film of this type) and a sense of wonder and magic, and true menace (is there a better film out there that captures the grim desire to grow out of adolesence than \\"Empire Strikes Back\\" and all of its dark and sinister implications?). Leave the Ewoks out, and you've got one of the all-time best cinematic trilogies ever made, and now-- aren't we blessed? --they've come to DVD courtesy of Mr. Lucas's constipated, control freak manner. As usual, fans are left wanting... and though I've yet to purchase the DVD's I'm a little concerned at the level of care that went into this vaunted DVD edition versus the level of care that went into the DVD special edition (and even standard edition) DVD releases of Peter Jackson's LOTR trilogy. Lucas seemed unable to get, or unable to care about getting, Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford's input on the commentary tracks, and that alone is reason for concern.      Still, the DVD set, with all of Lucas's tinkering... tinkering, mind you that did NOT need to be done, is a must have, regardless.      Our wishes as fans may not have been answered, but George finally granted us the pleasure of owning the original trilogy on DVD, and for that, may the Force be with him.
B0001MDP3G|3.0|This film started off on the right track but quickly became rather melodramatic and boring. I didn't feel any sympathy for nicole kidman's character because frankly, and I know this will upset some people, I just don't think she is that good of an actress.  She was flat and had no emotion whatsoever. Jude Law was a little better but not by much. I think the main stars were overshadowed by the minor actors in the movie.  I thought Natalie Portman was excellent in this movie as the single mother alone in the woods.  Philip Hoffman was extremely funny as the randy minister jude law picked up on the way. I think there were good scenes in the movie but it was too long and lacked emotion.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Many SF shows started out slow and found themselves in later seasons, B5 and the terribly underrated DS9 being prime examples (I think even Joss appreciates DS9 as being the superior Trek given previous comments).  <br />  <br />Well, I should have known better from Joss. I loved it right away, even though Fox aired the episodes out of order. I remember hoping that somehow at least these episodes would be released on DVD. Never did I imagine so many others would feel the same way and make this such a big seller. I've bought several sets for friends and family, all of whom now love the show (or are just pandering to me so I'll leave them alone, but still). <br />  <br />I'm thrilled the movie is getting made. I'm the GM of a small theater in Florida and I plan to do whatever I can to promote the hell out of Serenity. I'd love to throw a mini-convention in the lobby and dedicate the entire theater to the movie when it opens. Maybe I could host the (central-Florida) premiere of Serenity. Okay, I'm getting a little ahead of myself here. Still, the thought of having an Alan Tudyk or Gina, or Jewel, or Adam, or even Joss or Nathan visit my little hole in the wall is like thinking about winning the lottery. Fun to dream a little. <br />  <br />Either way, we all just have to make sure Serenity does damn well at the box office so we can have the show back. <br /> <br />Of course there are other issues in this country that need addressing, but appreciating art is part of what makes life worth living.  Firefly is one of those works of art.
B00009V7RF|4.0|This is the perfect album to just have a good time and party with. The beats are mad, the flow is irrestistable, and the songs are all hyped up. &quot;Hands Up&quot; is fun and really makes you want to put your hands up, &quot;Hey Mama&quot;, &quot;Shut Up&quot;, &quot;Smells Like Funk&quot;, &quot;The Boogie That Be&quot; are all just a pleasure to dance to. My favorite &quot;Let's Get Retarded&quot; (which is now released as &quot;Let's Get It Started&quot;) lifts you up and gets you so hype its unbelievable. All the tracks will have you flowin' in your own individual way. If your a party person, who loves to just have a good time then pick this LP up and, as they so politely put it, LETS GET COO-KOO.
B00024BHTC|2.0|I'd like to do a proper review of Nightwish as well.  Lets go back to the seventies when rock/opera and classical music met, Ritchie Blackmore, the late Randy Rhoads and chart toppers Queen especially incorporated classical and opera into their music.  During the 80's Neo-classical metal thrived with Yngwie J Malmsteen, Calchony and countless other Metal Bands that played their guitars in Minor Keys, incorporating Bach, Paganni and Opera into their Metal Music.  In the Nineties, bands like Dream Theatre, Symphony X and numerous other neo-classical based musicians from Shrapnel records appeared.  Even well established bands like Metallica took to mixing their music with orchestral arrangements.  To anybody who hasn't lived through all this, then Nightwish would seem to be a good band.  To anybody that has then they would notice straight away that Nightwish are using countless pieces of musical ideas taken from the past.  I honestly think the difference between the reviewers is simple.  One set are young and the other set are old.   Nightwish sound like a goodish band, their music is tight and is a change from the nu-metal crap that's out there, so that's a thumbs up from me in that respect.  But, whenever I have listened to any tracks of theirs, I know in the back of my mind that I have heard a band do something similar before, and when this is in the back of your mind it's impossible to get into them.   It may be fresh in Finland, but it sure as isn't fresh in the West.
B000002GDJ|5.0|IMHO this is the best police record ever made. evolving from the rough punk of outlandos d'amour and before the commercial involution of zenyatta mondatta, the record has a good balance of music and lyrics.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have to admit, when I first heard of this show I just dismissed it because of its premise: A western-type series set in space 500 years from now. I HATE WESTERNS and the only entertainment I enjoyed that dealt with space was Star Wars. I was the anti-trekkie. Then one day I saw Roswell here on amazon.com and went to buy it and saw that there was a discounted price if I bought these two shows at the same time. <br />  <br /> I then figured &quot;Hey, it's a Joss Whedon show, it can't be too bad, and if I don't like it I'll just resell it.&quot; Well, two months later I still hadn't watched it and I was sorta bored so I put it in my DVD player and started watching it. I immediately fell in love with the show and was so upset when I finished it and there was no more episodes left. <br />  <br /> Now, a month later I was searching through imdb.com and came across the name Gina Torres, whom I had seen before in Angel - Season Four, Cleopatra 2525, and recently, Firefly, I clicked onto her bio and read her other films/appearances and was shocked when I saw the name &quot;Zoe&quot; twice, I looked at both titles and was elated to find out that Joss Whedon is now filming a movie entitled &quot;Serenity&quot;, which is a movie based upon this TV show, and he is having ALL of the original actors in this show portray the same characters again. THERE IS JUSTICE IN THIS WORLD!!! <br />  <br /> I know I got off task, so back to the show, this show transcends the generalization people give to it, it is a drama, comedy and space show all in one. But this does not state how easy it is to love this show even if you do not like these genres. My advice is to buy this set, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!
B00003CXA6|5.0|Turner Entertainment's 3+ hour film on the battle of Gettysburg; the turning point of the Civil War where over 53,000 men lost their lives after 3 days of fighting near a small Pennsylvania town in July of 1863. The film has a good script, strong cast, and great cinematography. A good film to be watched by the whole family.          The film primarily covers the strategic aspects of the battle through action scenes and character studies. Almost all of the political, strategic, and tactical aspects at play in this battle are covered by the film. The characters depicted are primarily the Union and Confederate officers who participated in the battle. This allows the viewer to identify with the characters while not losing any sense of the events in the battle. The audience is enlightened to both the confusions and revelations generals such as Lee, Pickett, Bufford, and others experienced through the course of the battle. All of the actors delivered impeccable performances: especially Jeff Daniels as Chamberlain.          In terms of action, the film is very meticulous as to detail thanks to the many Civil War reenactment societies that participated in its making. One draw back is that the battle scenes are somewhat sterile and unrealistic: unlike the PC carnage shown in the film, victims of grape shot and shrapnel didn't simply fly in the air and fall down again as if they were making a touchdown at the Super Bowl. The Napoleanic tactics of marching in close formations to within less than 50 yards of the enemy usually resulted in bodies being butchered in every horrible way: leaving only blood, guts, and loose limbs on the ground. The film's sensibilities are understandable though, it was made for TV and its format allows for a wider audience of all ages.          This is a great movie that satisfies on many levels. History buffs will like it because of its detail while others will like it because of its deep character studies. This is a film to be enjoyed by the wholefamily.

B000065U1N|4.0|Riddley Scott sure did a great job at covering every tactical detail of the botched 1993 extraction mission. The film is perhaps less successful in presenting the political complexities involved in the conflict and the motivations of the parties involved. I felt that the political message of this movie was rather vague if not naive, thus my reason for four stars. <br /> <br />The film is brilliant for its reenactment of the events and its detailed depiction of commando operations in an urban setting. The film properly shows how the commanding officers failed to include the chaotic volatility of Mogadishu as a factor in their plans: General Montgomery made very similar logistical errors in preparing the plans for Operation Market-Garden in 1944. As a result, many of the soldiers were ill-prepared for the mission. An example of this was when the transports were leaving the target area and trying to find their way through the town. The topographical surveillance was made by satellite and relayed by officers either in helicopters or in headquarters: their instructions to turn left, go right, go straight were useless if not harmful because none of their GPDs or sattelites could show the armed mobs and road blocks spontaneously forming all over the city: more often than not, the COs led the soldiers straight into roadblocks and ambushes. Montgomery made similar errors in underestimating enemy resistance and thinking that reinforcements would come to Arnheim in 2 days as opposed to a week. <br /> <br />The film remains rather apolitical but should have done more in showing how the politics were self-serving and Machiavellian on all sides. The film should have done more to elaborate on how US intelligence/counter-terrorism operations and influence over navigation in/out of the Red Sea were the primary US political interests in East Africa as opposed to the official propaganda of saving human lives from imminent starvation (Muhammad Adid was sought more for his terrorist/arms trade links than his starving of political undesirables.) Interestingly enough, the US didn't seem to care too much about the millions killed in the Rwandan genocide at just about the same time. Aside from that, there wasn't too much jingoism in the film. The central theme of the film is more of the commeraderie between soldiers in a time of conflict and how that keeps them functioning as a fighting unit. <br /> <br />
B0000028UK|4.0|Ok. First of all, this is my first review so I am kind of clueless to all of this. I just want to say that I am the kind of reviewer where a CD has to be PERFECT in order to recieve 5 stars. Some reviewers like using big words to describe a CD or go through every song and evaluate each one. I will just give you the facts. Anyways... <br />  <br /> Vs. was the first Pearl Jam CD ever listened to and I'm glad it was. There isn't a song that I skip over or just to burn time. I was fairly surprised to find that none of the songs sounded the same which is pretty good in comparison to today's music. My favorite songs on Vs. are 'Dissident,' 'Leash,' 'Elderly Woman...,' and 'Indifference.' Finding Pearl Jam recently has given me a relief to know that there are still bands around that play good, thought out, musically driven songs unlike some other bands *cough* Taking Back Sunday, Blink 182, etc. PJ has a unique sound that no other band has. Ed Vedder's low voice can go to a screaching high and the way Mike McCready and Stone Gossards' guitars over lap sounds great. This CD has to be heard by any Grunge or Hard Rock enthusiast looking for something different than crap played on the radio. The more you listen, the better it gets.
B000286S8S|1.0|DO NOT BUY THIS VAN RIP-OFF Release. The 3 new songs don't even sound like Van Halen, the lyrics must have been written by a 2 year old, and the vocals are horrible. The rest of the 2 CD's were released on the last Best Of, and other previous albums, so why did I buy the same old stuff again. Just dumb! <br /> <br />Eddie Van Halen said he had written enough new material for 10 new albums, and this is all we get. Total rip-off!. One of the CD's also has a defective track, which makes the 3rd Van Halen album release in a row with problems. This band should have retired years ago, when they still had some dignity!  <br /> <br />This album is nothing more than a cheap money grab. <br /> <br />
B000002H97|5.0|First and foremost, this album should not be compared to Thrash &quot;classics&quot; such as Ride the Lightning or Reign in Blood. Metallica has moved on to the Heavy Metal genre, as opposed to their previous Thrash Metal label. <br />  <br /> This album has so much more to offer than any of Slayers' garbage such as the 28 minute thrash 'epic' Reign in Blood. James Hetfield can actually sing, as shown by &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot; and &quot;The Unforgiven&quot;, unlike the bassist (i dont even know his name, nor do i care to learn it) for Slayer.  <br />  <br /> Kerry King and Jeff Hennamen (sp?) are the most over rated guitar duo in Metal. Unlike the Slayer duo, who think that speed and squeels are everyhing, Kirk Hammett proves that playing a million miles an hour isn't always the best way to deliver a breathtaking solo. Having already proved his chops (AJFA, MOP) he delivers a straight-foward powerful solo on each and every track of this album. <br />  <br /> Though hated by millions of Metallica fans, Bob Rock does finally get Jason Newstead heard on this album (My friend of Misery) and manages not to drown the rest of the band members with Lars' symbol play and heavy bass tom passages (think of the beginning of enter sandman). <br />  <br /> I have grown up with this album (bought it when i was 8 or so) as well as every other Metallica album. I personally rank it third, right below Master of Puppets (the greatest metal cd of all time) and ...And Justice For All. The 'Black' album blows anything slayer ever did out of the water, which is why this cd has sold over 15 million copies world-wide, and why Slayer cant get out of playing festivals and small arena tours. <br />  <br /> I fully recommend this album. 15+ million people can't be wrong, you won't be let down.
0553573403|4.0|I'm generally not a fan of epic fantasy series, but a friend recommended this novel to me, so I thought I'd give it a shot.  I really enjoyed reading it--what appealed to me most were the characters, particularly Eddard because of his committment to his family, Arya, and Jon.  Since you're reading from each individual perpective, there are times when you know more than your character-- and I found that sense of dramatic irony to be very effective.  The episodic nature kept the action and intrigue fresh, so I never found myself weary of reading.  My criticisms with the book are that there were too many characters to keep up with, and sometimes I felt like I was reading towards something that never happens.  Additionally, I felt as thought Martin should have included a little more information about the 'common' people of the realm and the general economy (which seem to be tacked on in the next installment as an afterthought).  Overall, it was a thoroughly fascinating read.
B0000C9V3T|4.0|I'm pretty happy with this volume.  Quentin is a genius.  This is a must have for any Kill Bill fan.  Save your dough on volume 2 though.
B00006879E|5.0|Well, I'm not going to write a new york times review or anything, but what I'm going to tell you is stop in and pick one of these cd's up. Maroon 5 is one of those great things in the music world that come along when your desperate for a breath of fresh air.  I'm a huge John Mayer and DMB fan and this hit the spot. This is some great stuff to take along in the car and sing like crazy to. (Who cares about the guy next to you at the red light....he's probably listening to them too!!) Pick it up, give it a listen, and I promise you'll enjoy it, I give it five bright and shiny stars!!!
B0001LJCPC|3.0|I was a little dissapointed with the second volume (I have both 1 & 2).  There are a few diamonds in the rough, but overall, the first volume was much better.  Only buy the second volume if you absolutely must have it for your collection-if you can do without, save your dough.
B000002H2H|5.0|From whence does the inspiration for a piece of music like &quot;Fight Fire With Fire&quot; come? Sure, you can name the band's main influences at the time - mostly British metal like Motorhead and Diamondhead - but there was really no precendent at the time for music like this. Metallica was the pioneer of thrash/speed metal. They invented something, a brand new idiom that was unfamiliar yet well-defined. This is no small feat. Give it a try, you'll see. <br />  <br /> &quot;Ride the Lighting&quot; set the standard for this new genre. Their debut record just set the tone, but this one defined the esthetic. Despite the fact that it is really (arguably)the first statement of a whole new art form, &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; sounds assured and well-conceived. These guys knew exactly what they wanted and these compositions are as solid and sophisticated as they are raucous and radical.  <br />  <br /> Metallica topped this recording with &quot;Master of Puppets.&quot; Then, Cliff Burton (bassist) died and the band began it's rapid simultaneous decline into mediocrity and rise to commercial success.
0517194112|5.0|I've had the privilege to meet Barack Obama, and to read 'Dreams From My Father' several years ago. For those who have just discovered Barack after his convention keynote speech, what you saw was only the tip of the iceberg. This is an immmensely talented, complex, intelligent and inspiring man on so many levels. As eloquent as his speech was, his book is equally so, and offers insights into how, as he put it, 'the skinny boy with the funny name' has evolved. I can only hope there will be many more books from Barack, who promises to be one of the most exciting politicians of the 21st century.
B00000J7SS|5.0|No one but Miles Davis could have gotten away with 'Bitches Brew' when it came out. While this album did divorce Davis from the general jazz-buying public at the time (they accused him of selling out to the rock movement), the reality was that Davis had thoroughly explored the traditional jazz idiom, and he was getting restless. His second great quintet's albums in the mid-60s had given ample warning that changes were coming.  Here, Miles fully fuses his far-ranging jazz conception with rock, and by doing so he nearly single-handedly invents... yes you guessed it, fusion. Nearly all of the tunes feature a large ensemble of players, many of whom would later front the popular fusion bands of the 70s. In some cases there are three keyboards, two basses, and a full horn section (including bass clarinet!) going at once. And don't forget John McLaughlin tearing up the guitar. The longer tunes are hypnotic group improvisations around very simple, spare themes - often just a bass or keyboard vamp. Producer Teo Macero does a masterful job of paring the jams down into more palatable slices, and assembling them into cohesive, organic compositions. My favorite track is 'Sanctuary', a fusion ballad that serves as proof of Miles' unquestionable command over the ensemble process, even in this new musical landscape.
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|i bought D12 1st cd beacuse i liked their 1st song  purple pills. i ended up listening to the whole thing and it was really good. I was excited when i found out they were making a new cd!!! the 1st day it was realesed i bought it!!! and i love it! D12 is my favorite group and i hope they make another one! if you like eminem or d12 i strongly erge you to buy this album!!!
B000174LVQ|5.0|How in your right mind can you not enjoy a Paco De Lucia album? I mean: the guy is a genius and he's helped shape Flamenco for the past 40+ years. This is his first album in a while, and one that pays tribute to the genre that he's so well known for, by sticking to the basics: his guitar, hand clapping and six different vocalists sporting heart tearing voices interpreting his bulerias, rumbas and tientos. My favorite tracks are &quot;Patio Custodio&quot;, Antonia&quot; and &quot;Que Venga El Alba&quot;. By all means, get yourself a copy and chill out to the best Spanish guitar in the world.
6305308659|2.0|Pleasantville is yet another gnostic-inspired psy-op movie, intended to convince one that   authencity and spiritual fullfilment require the rejection of traditional images of Man. On the surface,  Pleasantville is an allegory about ignorance, bigotry, and the propagation of false consciousness in regard  to gender, family, and sexuality: Reese Witherspoon's character, cynical and jaded, succeeds in seducing the  all-American boyfriend she has in Pleasantville, giving a whole new meaning to sexual liberation. The   consequence of her sexual promiscuity is a sort of enlightenment - literally and figuratively - that results in a  chain reaction in which the black and white world of Pleasantville begins to turn colored. Whether this is   a nod in the direction of occultic beliefs regarding sex magic is for its Hollywood creators to address; in   any case, sex then becomes the vehicle by which teenagers and eventually adults overcome the lies of   the Garden of Eden in which they live. Gnostic elements are especially brought into focus when Toby   McGuire is offered an apple by his date. Later, Don Knotts, the God figure who transplants McGuire and  Witherspoon inside the 1950s-esque sitcom world of Pleasantville, berates McGuire for screwing everything  up while showing McGuire his eating of the apple as proof of his causing Pleasantville's corruption. Essentially,  the movie, like other gnostic - kaballistic Hollywood movies, inverts the moral scale: God is bad, a petty tyrant, who   seeks to keep Man enslaved in ignorance and fear. The movie uses avant-garde art, literature, and even a   few cuts from Dave Brubeck and Miles Davis' Kind of Blue to make it clear that culture and spiritual enrichment   require experimentation and the destruction or rejection of the Ancien Regime. So, the message seems to  be that the Fall was both necessary and good if Man was to ever become existentially authentic and free, while  spiritual enlightenment requires a rejection of the liethat created the apple in the Garden of Eden. Pleasantville  paints Christianity and Christian anthropology, by default, as responsible for all the true evil and degradation of  Man. At one point, the black and white conservative holdouts take to burning books and smashing windows  with alleged obscene art on them. While the film would like one to think of Nazi Germany or, perhaps, the   segregated South (boy, doesn't that court room in the closing scenes of the movie look like the one from To   Kill a Mockingbird?), no where does the film depict anything allegorical in regard to the Bolshevik   destruction of Orthodox churches, the destruction of centuries - old icons and art, and the repression  of millions that the same metaphysical and spiritual revolutionary movement evident in Pleasantville was   responsible for in Russia. Now where does this moral inversion really come from?  Like Field of Dreams (&quot;Build it and he will come&quot;),. the Truman Show, The Matrix, and Eyes Wide Shut,   Pleasantville is another coded movie -- coded for whom is one's guess.
0804102988|3.0|Rutherford's Sarum is a sweeping epic tale of the history of Salisbury as he chronicals five families from the Neolithic Age through the 1980s. What begins as an easy comprehension of the relations of the families develops into confusing, complex intermarriages and overlaps that are all but incomprehensible. If Rutherford had not included the family trees in the beginning of the book I would have been completely lost. As another reviewer mentioned previously, it is easy to become involved in these characters' lives and wanting to know what happens next in their stories. But then you turn the page and find that the novel has progressed 80 years and those characters that you came to love are dead. <br /> <br />For historical fiction, this is a decent novel that is thoroughly research. He includes details and facts that truly make the story seem as though it was once living. However, as any history goes, some parts are more interesting than others, but this varies based on the reader's interests. <br /> <br />Overall, a fairly well written book with great research. If the size isn't daunting, give it a shot.
B0000CABJ1|4.0|WELL, I HAVE A NEW CD WITH ALMOST THE SAME MUSIC IN OTHER COMPILATIONS, THE SOUND IN THIS EDITION IS GREAT AND ARE INCLUDED ALL HER FAMOUS SONGS, BUT WHERE ARE; DINNER WITH GERSHWIN, CARRY ON, WORK THAT MAGIC AND MELODY OF LOVE? I GUESS THOSE SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED AS VERY BEST. ANYWAY THIS COMPILATION INCLUDE TWO BRAND NEW JEWELS;THAT'S THE WAY IT IS AND I WILL LIVE FOR LOVE AND THE REMIX OF MY FAVORITE; YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL.
B000089CJI|5.0|Postal Service was introduced to me early in the year and it has been a staple in my car and on my iPod ever since. A bit mix of electronica and pop that can get you ready for a night on the town yet mesmerizing and soothing when you want to just chill and relax with some friends.  <br /> <br />Highlight songs include: Clark Gable, Brand New Colony and Nothing Better.
B000060P79|4.0|I am a huge fan of Simple Plan, and I have to say they are my favorite band. But the reason I'm giving this album 4 stars is because,it's a bit on the poppy side, and I can only listen to one of their songs once or twice before i have to turn it to another one.I used to think that Simple Plan was all punk-rock and stuff, and then my sister came in, and her being like the hardcore music fan and always listening to bands like murderdolls and static-x, showed me Rancid and The Casualties. Those bands were really punk-rock. Simple Plan is more pop-punk than punk-rock, but it dosen't bother me. And I don't run around saying SP is sooo punk-rock and I'm so punk rock. If someone asks me what kind of music I like or what I consider myself to be, I'm speechless. I hate labels, and so do the rest of the 'punks' out there, but really, i don't think anyones true to that. Look at all the people who gave this album a bad review. They had to stick in that they are poppy punks or they are posuers or something. And then they rip on them for being Canadian. What's up with that? Does Canada effect punk music now? That's a really stupid excuse. I actually find Canada better than America right now. I really don't care what all the quote on quote 'real' punks say, and I recommend this CD to everyone. Don't listen to the people who are too obsessed on picking out who's punk and who's not these days. If they wouldn't have been listening to that 'Top 40' radio station or if they wouldn't have watched MTV or whatever, they wouldn't know who the band was.The CD is great. Enough Said.
0553213105|5.0|Nearly 600 reviews have been written on this book at the time of this writing so I suppose there is little I can say that has not already been said about Austen's masterpiece Pride and Prejudice. What I can say is this: this is probably my all-time favorite book and seems to be the same for countless others.<br /><br />Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy are the two main protagonists and are surrounded by the ill-matched Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, the fatuous Mr. Collins and his condescending patroness Lady Catherine de Bourgh and the unscrupulous George Wickham. As the story unfolds, there are twists and turns in the plot as the reader keeps wanting Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy to give up their own pride and prejudices about each other.<br /><br />A wonderful portrait of nineteenth century English society as well as an entertaining satire on Jane Austen's England. A must read.
B00005JM02|5.0|People often enjoy movies the first time they see it, but lose interest by the second, third, or fourth times.  I've seen Finding Nemo 4 times, and I've enjoyed it each time.  The plot is originial, the jokes are fresh, and the movie is lighthearted enough for little kids to watch while still being exciting and suspenseful enough to catch an adult's attention.  The Toy Story series was pretty good, but this movie is great. <br />
B000002TQV|5.0|This is one of my favorites. I remember being a junior in highschool and listening to it. Brings back some cool memories.
B00005OMTT|4.0|I enjoyed this collection of Enigma's grestest hits immensely but I don't like the album version of Mea Culpa as much as I enjoy the Fading Shades mix. I was actually rather surprised that it wasn't included on this collection. The remix of TNT For The Brain is far better than the original.  <br /> <br />The edited version of Push The Limits could have been left out and the album version put in. Other than these few minor flaws, I do recommend this CD for all Enigma fans.
B000068VHQ|5.0|This cd is sooooo soothing and relaxing. This music is well produced and the vocals are emotional and original.
B000000OQF|5.0|this is the greatest rock n roll album ever. at a time when disgusting hair metal was dominating tv, along came Guns N Roses. they flung some dirt on the squeaky clean face of rock with this 50 minute piece of hard rock heaven. the album starts off with WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE, a slammin heavy metal anthem, which leads right into ITS SO EASY, another hard rock classic. next is NIGHTRAIN, one of my favorite songs on the album. OUT TA GET ME i dont realy enjoy at all, i usually skip it, but that doesnt mean its not a good song. MR BROWNSTONE is a cool song with awesome guitar and awesome drums. PARADISE CITY is one of the greatest songs ever. MY MICHELLE is a bit darker, but still a good song. THINK ABOUT YOU is a nice lighthearted fast paced song. SWEET CHILD O MINE is the best song on the album, with a classic opening riff, and only slash could accomplish this. YOURE CRAZY is a more punkish song a bit more fast. ANYTHING GOES is kind of dirty, but has a nice melody. the last song, ROCKET QUEEN, is one of my favorite songs, but the womans orgasms in the middle kind of annoy me sometimes. about halfway through ROCKET QUEEN it switches to a nice love ballad which closes the album on a great note <br /> <br />BOTTOM LINE: GREATEST ROCK ALBUM EVER YOU MUST OWN IT!
B000000H57|5.0|The production and sound quality is really good and they really pull you in to feel the emotions of the music.  <br /> I remember listening to Love You to Death and Red Water over and over again. <br /> Really solid album.
B000060P79|1.0|simple plan are just the worst. they have no talent whatsoever, theyre guitar riffs are nothing but pointless bangning on the strings, their singer hanst even hit puberty yet, they just arent good. i will give it to them that they probably have the best lyrics out of the pop punk movement today, since good charlotte couldnt write a decent song if their life depended on it, new found glory just sing about their relationships and their singre is even worse, and blink 182 are just plain annoying. i despise pop punk, but if you are going to listen to it, i suggest green day above these retard canadiens or any of the talentless pop punk  bands that have arisen in the past 3 years. i just hate the fact that everytime i turn on the tv i have to look at usher or beyonce or lil homo or whatever the hell those rappers are caling themselves today. so when i finally see a real band, im looking for something like metallica or gusn n roses, but no, i am faced with simple plan and good charlotte. will somebody please fix this problem? get all this MTV trash off the tv and lets get some good music back. MTV needs to get headbangers ball back if their still gonna keep their garbage they have on there now, at least get some other stuff too.
B000000WJZ|5.0|This cd is really amazing. Mayonaise is my favorite song and it seems like it's also alot of peoples favotite, but it is weird how it never got popular or had a video ?HUH? <br /> Anyways this cd is cool.
B00005JN2F|5.0|Being a Robert Ludlum fanatic I had to see this movie. If you have read the book and are looking for a movie based on the book, you will be disappointed. The movie is great but only shares the title of the book. Most of the storyline isn't even close to the plot of the book.It is definitely one of the greatest action movies I have ever seen. Matrix doesn't even come close. Definitely better than The Bourne Identity. Read the book and see the movie. They are two different stories. Both well worth the price and time....
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This is a unique look at addictions of all kinds - TV, food, chocolate, dieting, fame, wealth, coffee, shopping, cults, thrills, sex, and drugs just to name a few. This movie will haunt you. The final chapters are harrowing. It's not just a cautionary tale about drugs, it's an eye opener about the addictions we all have and how otherwise good people can be thrown into chaos by an obsession. To view this as an anti-drug movie is to miss the point -any addiction could prove just as deadly. The cinematography and music are incredible. Buy it!
630521610X|4.0|Casey Becker (Drew Barrymore) innocently answers the phone as she prepares to watch a scary movie. She doesn't recognie the voice on the other end, so she hangs up. The person persistantly calls back and says that if she hangs up gain, he'll gut her &quot;like a fish&quot;. He then tells her to look on the back porch. <br />  <br /> She does as she is advised and discovers her boyfriend on the back porch with his insides on the outside. She begins to run, but doesn't get far. She makes it outside but then the killer stabs her in the chest. Her parents find her blood corpse hanging from a tree shortly after. <br />  <br /> Everyone is talking about the murders the next day at school. That night, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), whose mother was brutally raped and murdered one year earlier, gets a disturbing phone call from the same voice. The killer gets into her house but she just barely escapes. <br />  <br /> The killer continues to try to murder Sidney throughout the movie. He also tries to kill other people, including Sidney's best friend Tatum Riley (Rose McGowan), &quot;Top Story&quot; correspondant Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox), Deputy Dwight Riley (David Arquette), Sidney's boyfriend Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich), Principal Arthur Himbry (Henry Winkler) and others. This shows that the movie had a good cast. There were a lot of talented actors such as the ones mentioned above, which helped make the movie better. <br />  <br /> The kills are done rather well. Most of the deaths come from a result of a knife wound or in some cases a gun shot. There are some pretty creative ones though, such as the death that takes place in the garage scene. <br />  <br /> It's nice to see a regular phychopathic killer going on a murderous rampage, rather than some superhuman freak that can't be stopped. Another good aspect about the movie is the sense of mystery as to who the killer really is. You have your suspects throughout the movie but you don't find out who it is until theend. As Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy) says in the movie, &quot;Everybody's a suspect!&quot; <br />  <br /> When you finally find out who the killer is, it's a bit shocking. Then the motive and cover up is revealed. This is when everything comes together. <br />  <br /> I like how the theme of this movie was that they were living out a scary movie. The aforementioned Randy, horror movie fanatic, gives us the three rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie. They are usually true and pretty acurate. However, there are exceptions, as proved in the movie. The rules are as follows: <br />  <br /> 1. You can never have sex -- &quot;sex equals death&quot; <br /> 2. You can never drink or do drugs -- &quot;the sin factor&quot; <br /> 3. Never say 'I'll be right back' -- &quot;you won't be back&quot; <br />  <br /> The movie also makes reference to and/or mentions multiple horror movies. These include Halloween, A Nightmare On Elm Street, Friday The 13th, Prom Night, Evil Dead, Psycho, and Carrie, among others. <br />  <br /> Wes Craven, the man behind A Nightmare On Elm Street, directed all three of the Scream movies. In fact, his name is mentioned in the film and there is a janitor wearing the old freddy sweater and hat ensemble. It doesn't live up to Nightmare, but not many movies do. <br />  <br /> In my opinion, Scream is easily the best movie in the trilogy. It had a pretty big impact on moviegoers and was pretty successful. The 'ghost face' mask is like the present-day equivalent to Jason's hockey mask or Freddy's glove. Everyone can recognize it and tell you what movie it was from, even if they haven't seen the movie. Scream is probably one of the best horror movies of the 1990's.
0553579908|5.0|Despite my hobbies that continually surround the fantasy genre, my hatred for fantasy novels knows no bound. I puke at the lack of character development, plot driven story arcs and the lack-of-gray good or bad guys.<br /><br />George RR Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series has done all the cliches: raised the bar, above and beyond reproach and easily the best epic fantasy ever. While all credit is due to the godfather of fantasy (and fantasy epics), JRR Tolkien has many children whom all drank from the teat of the first best fantasy epic, Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />Where GRRM differs is this: strength of plot and character development does not depend on fantastic monsters or beasts or incredible items of power but from the actual (gasp!) characters themselves. Never have I read about characters that felt real and yet heroic or despised at the same time. These people are not cookie cutter characters that you could pull from a typical fantasy novel. Their motivations and desires have an incredible foundation. It helps to understand why certain people do certain things especially when you know all the facts.<br /><br />One of the very things that is semi-resolved in A Clash of Kings is &quot;would you sacrifice someone else's child to save the life of your own children?&quot;. It is this and so many more themes that come into play that makes this book and the series thus far a literal page turner. (Two exact weeks to finish both A Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings... hopefully with A Sword of Storms, I can make it three for three.)<br /><br />If you like reading or fantasy at all and not necessarily both, do yourself a favour and get all three books. You will kick yourself for having to wait if you ordered separately.
6305546789|5.0|He goes by many names... The Shape, The Boogeyman, Michael Myers. Whatever you want to call him, this John Carpenter creation is an icon of horror and strikes fear in all of us. Carpenter, who not only directed and co-wrote the movie, also provided the suspenseful music, including the famous 5/4 timed theme.<br /><br /> Though it's just a low buget film (of $320,000), it spawned sequels, masks, toys, and a following of horror fans. It spread by word-of-mouth when it first came out and then got its break when it was shown at the Chicago Film Festival in 1878. From there, it became the most success independently released film to date, grossing over $70 million worldwide in its original theatrical release. It's now one of the most influential horror movies of all time. Many imitators have tried, but nobody can capture the terrifying greatness of Halloween. It's very impressive that it was only filmed in just four weeks.<br /><br /> The movie starts on a cold Halloween night in 1963. We see the beginning of the movie through the eyes of a six year old Michael Myers. This technique of first person point of view from the killer's eyes was rarely used before this. After its success, other movies tried to copy it, but couldn't capture the moment like Halloween did. Michael goes inside his house, enters the kitchen, opens a drawer, and pulls out a large knife. He hides in the shadows, making sure he can't be seen as he makes his way up to his sister's room. He puts on a clown mask and reaches his destination. His sister turns around and sees him. This doesn't stop the mini-maniac -- he stabs her multiple times and runs out of the house.<br /><br /> We are then taken to Octover 30, 1978. It's been fifteen years since Michael's vicious killing. Michael is locked away in Smith's Grove-Warren County Sanitarium. Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence), his physchiatrist, wants to bring him to a safer places because he is the only one who knows the evil this now twenty-one year old is capable of. When he attempts to do so, Michael manages to steal his car, despite the fact that he's never driven before. An interesting fact is that you can see the wrench he uses to break through the car window, although it's supposed to be done with his bare hand to show his monstrous power.<br /><br /> The next day, which just so happens to be Halloween, you are introduced to the main character, Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis). You also meet her two friends, Lynda VanDerclork (P.J. Soles) and Annie Brackett (Nancy Loomis). Michael stalks these girls throughout the movie in their small, suburban town of Haddonfield, Illinois. Why he is doing this is revealed in the second installment of the series. He's not a very good stalker, but Laurie is the only one that catches on. He does a lot of there-one-second, gone-the-next sort of things.<br /><br /> After some killing and scaring, Michael chases Laurie into her house and attempts to kill her. It's pretty amazing which he goes through in just the first movie and still manages to come back for another seven squels. This includes being stabbed in the neck with a sewing needle, poked in the eye with a hanger, stabbed in the stomach with his own knife, shot seven consecutive times, and fell out of a second story window. Nonetheless, the ending paves the way for a sequel.<br /><br /> One unique thing about this move is the murders. Michael only kills five people and two dogs in the whole movie and the majority of the them happen off screen due to the lack of special effects. This shows that a horror movie doesn't have to be bloody and gorey to be a classic. The sequels went in a bit of a gorrier direction and none of them were as successful or as good as the original.<br /><br /> The acting was good, particularly from Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence. Most people involved in the movie, behind and in front of the camera, went on to bigger and better things. Casting Curtis as Laurie, the herione of the film, was a very smart idea.She's the dauger of Psycho star Janet Leigh and screen performer Tony Curtus. Halloween was her first role in a feature film and she was paid only $8,000.<br /><br /> Curtis has been deamed a &quot;scream queen&quot; after going on to other horror films, such as Terror Train, Prom Night, and The Fog (all in 1980). The next year, she did other horrors such as Road Games, Death of Centerfold, and Halloween 2 (all in 1981). Then she went on to do comedies, dramas, thrillers, and other types of movies. She came back to the Halloween franchise in 2001 to do Halloween: H20.<br /><br /> There is no doubt that Halloween is a great movie and the best in the series. It's been proclaimed &quot;The Gone With The Wind of horror movies.&quot; It's no wonder that so many other slasher flicks have tried to copy it. Is in necessary to see this?

B00008EY65|3.0|This movie was exactly what I was expecting.  It had entertaining CGI action sequences, and cheesy not-very-well acted drama.  The plot doesn't keep you on the edge of your seat, but overall the movie was worth seeing.

B00028HBKM|5.0|Unlike the other Jesus movies of the past which portrayed Jesus' suffering and death in a very &quot;sugar-coated&quot; manner, Gibson holds nothing back from the audience in this blood-soaked version of the &quot;Stations of the Cross&quot;.  <br />  <br /> I don't understand what some of the pastors and parents of young children were thinking about when they would tell reporters that they would take the kids to the opening of &quot;Passion&quot; back in February 2004. THIS IS NOT A MOVIE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN. And, as I saw at the theatre, there are a lot of adults that can't handle it, either.  <br />  <br /> With more violence than you can shake a stick at, it is not a movie that you sit and enjoy a bucket of popcorn while watching it.  <br />  <br /> With that said, I thought it was one of the best movies that I have seen in a long time. I was on the edge of my seat while watching it, mainly because of the dread of knowing what was going to happen next, and the uncertainty of how the scourging and crufifixion were to be portrayed. Because of this, I feel like &quot;Passion of the Christ&quot; is more of something to be experienced for yourself.  <br />  <br /> I highly recommend the movie, and I will be very surprised if it does not win a single Oscar next year.
B000003TAR|5.0|It is a much harsher album compared to the last two albums. This one does contain the better lyrics in it, but I just think &quot;Nevermind&quot; is slightly better. The songs are: <br />  <br /> Serve the servents: This is a good opener. There are some good verses, but a not-so-good chorus. All about his dad. 4/5 <br />  <br /> Scentless apprentice: Weird lyrics. It's one of the heavier tracks on the album. Massive shouting in it. 4/5 <br />  <br /> Heart-shaped box: Probably the best track on the album. Great lyrics and an unbeatable chorus. San very emotionally. 5/5 <br />  <br /> Rape me: Another good track. The intro sounds a bit like the intro to &quot;Smells like teen spirit&quot;. You think this is goanna be a soft song, but it gets louder. 5/5 <br />  <br /> Frances farmer will have her revenge on Seattle: This is a very catchy song. It's just a bit too long. 4.5/5 <br />  <br /> Dumb: Very relaxing. 5/5 <br />  <br /> Very ape: Quite a fast-paces song, and it's too short (1:55). The guitars sound amazing. They make a sort of crunchy sound. 3.5/5 <br />  <br /> Milk it: This a favourite. A very underrated song. It's one of those songs that's haunting and soft in the verses but gets louder in the chorus, with Kurt screaming. 5/5 <br />  <br /> Pennyroyal tea: This is another good track. I think this chorus is very catchy. 5/5 <br />  <br /> Radio friendly unit shifter: The chorus is good, one of the more faster songs. 3/5  <br />  <br /> Tourettes: Very short and very fast. It can be quite hard. Contains really long shouts. 4/5 <br />  <br /> All apologies: This is quite good when it starts off, but it does get worse. It's another relaxing track. 4/5 <br />  <br /> So, that's basically Nirvana's last album, and probably their best acomplished. I just think &quot;Nevermind&quot; is a tiny bit better.  <br />  <br />

B000002KN8|2.0|Before I begin this review, it may be unfair of me to judge the album so harshly. Firstly, I was introduced to Depeche Mode through Ultra, though I've explored and enjoyed their 80s stuff too. Secondly, Speak and Spell was released in '81, just when electro-pop was really starting to kick off, so of course it's not as good as what we have now.  <br />  <br /> This album is basically fluffy bubblegum pop (though it's a lot less sleazy than today's pop). This is not the dark, angsty and romantic Depeche Mode we all know and love. People who like upbeat synth sounds might enjoy this album, but it definitely wasn't my cup of tea. There was just nothing interesting about the music. In terms of the sound, I only enjoyed &quot;Tora Tora Tora&quot; and &quot;Just Can't Get Enough.&quot; <br />  <br /> My biggest problem with the album, however, is lyrics. Whether you're a hardcore DM fan or just someone looking to dabble, there is no possible way to deny the ridiculousness of some of these lyrics. I mean, the chorus to &quot;Photographic&quot; is: &quot;I take pictures / Photographic pictures&quot; - need I say more? The chorus to &quot;What's Your Name&quot; is: &quot;Hey you're such a pretty boy, you're so pretty&quot; (the band then proceed to spell out &quot;pretty&quot;: &quot;p-r-e-double t-y&quot;). And I won't even go into the terror that is &quot;Boys Say Go.&quot; Not surprisingly, the only decent lyrics on this album were found in &quot;Tora&quot;, which was written by Martin Gore as opposed to Vince Clarke. <br />  <br /> I applaud Depeche Mode for replacing Vince with Martin as the songwriter and for coming such a long way from this corn. If you're a diehard fan I suppose you might want to add this to your collection, but otherwise it's barely worth even burning.

B0002234LS|1.0|I do like Johnny Depp and most of his films, unfortunately this is his worst effort to date (even his short part in the first 'Nightmare On Elm Street' film is better than this). The director was messy and in a hurry while making this film. Why do I think this? I'll tell you why. All throughout the film, you can see the camera lights reflected in Johnny's glasses. Look for the green box in his glasses. When I see this, I wonder how a director can be so clumsy, it is as if he doesn't care about his work. And it doesn't happen once, it happens through the entire film!!<br /><br />Now as for the acting. Johnny looks as if he decided to dress up as a writer for Halloween. It looks like a bad high school costume. He is suppose to be a writer and walks around with an Einstein hair-do and a beaten up bathrobe. His acting as a writer is even worse. He sits with his legs crossed while polishing his glasses and his head cocked. Give me a break!!<br /><br />This is suppose to be a thriller. But I had my hand over my mouth trying to stifle my laughter. This movie is hilarious. The scene where he confronts his stalker by the truck which contains his 2 dead friends is beyond ludicrous.<br /><br />The ending will have you rolling your eyes. As Johnny sits eating his corn on the cob, which is suppose to be a metaphor. I just cannot believe how bad this film is. Watch if you want to laugh...
B00005JN2F|5.0|Dark, crisply directed, smartly written and harkening back to the 1960's style of political thriller like \\"The Spy Who Came in from The Cold,\\" \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" is the perfect antidote to the bloated, zeppelin balloon-sized messes of \\"I, Robot\\" and \\"The Day After Tomorrow.\\"<br /><br />And Matt Damon's performance as Jason Bourne has now deepened and matured and in the process has become irretrievably lost, mortally wounded, deeply touching and ultimately sad. His Bourne is a man without a family, without memories, without anything resembling a life. He has been manipulated and used and lives without any hope. Damon shows us all this without much more than a glance or a look of desperation emanating from his troubled eyes.<br /><br />Like \\"The Bourne Identity\\" before it, \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" succeeds because of the filmmakers commitment to stylish and cogent story-telling and intelligent writing.  At  \\"Supremacy's\\" end and Bourne walks off towards the horizon it is all too obvious that his so called Supremacy can only be described as that of a man forever doomed to spend the rest of his life looking over his shoulder, trusting no one and having nothing or no one to call his own.
B00008972S|5.0|I was not a fan of Romeo and Juliet when I read it freshman year, but after viewing this musical for the first time, I want to read it again! The end of this movie actually brought me to tears! I couldn't help it! I tried to hold them back, but when Maria held Anton (Tony)'s dead body in her arms, I cried! It is the story of two gangs who hate each other and are fighting over territory in the streets. The Jets are a group of white boys who have grown up in the streets because their parents aren't really the Brady Bunch kind (they are druggies, etc.). The Sharks are Puerto Ricans who have just moved to America and are trying to establish themselves in the new territory. The female Puerto Ricans see much opportunity in America, but the males are very pessimistic and feel unwelcome in this strange new land. The Sharks and Jets are cautious around each other and even taunt each other, but they never take action until Bernardo notices that his sister, Maria, has a love interest in Tony, who is a Jet. Anita, Maria's best friend, and Bernardo try to convince Maria to stop loving Tony, but Maria can't help it! Tempers flair and Bernardo and Riff are killed in a fight. You can guess what happens next if you have read R&J- revenge is on the minds of every gang member. The choreography is great and the music awesome. &quot;I feel pretty,&quot; &quot;Tonight,&quot; and &quot;Somewhere&quot; are some of my favorites! The extra dvd is disapppointing, but hey. The booklet has the full libretto and is nice, but I don't know how long it will last because unfortunately it doesn't appear to be made well.
B00005JM4Z|1.0|When I first saw the preview of 2 fast 2 furious in the tv commercial,I thougt that the movie will do a great job bringing the old cast back from The fast and the furious.But when I found out that Vin diesel was'nt going to appear in the second part,I was'nt happy about it at all.However,Paul walker who play the role of an ex-cop,tried his best to save the movie but he could'nt do it...It did'nt get the good stuff that part 1 got,the driving and the crashing looked too much like The Simpsons Road Rage,The Simpsons hit & run and Namco's Smashing drive.Spend your money in another place.
B0002858YS|4.0|I saw the band performing on Pepsi Smash, and liked their sound so much I took a chance and bought the cd. Thank God for luck, because the cd is nothing short of great. It had a certain 80's vibe to it, and it's something different from what's already out there. Some of the songs do sound the same, but for the most part, it's a great cd.<br /><br /> Stand out songs include &quot;Mr. Brightside&quot;, &quot;Somebody Told Me&quot;, &quot;On Top&quot;, and &quot;Midnight Show&quot;. I might skip one song on the entire cd, but all of the songs are good, so I could deal without skipping any.<br /><br /> If you're looking for a new band to listen to and you're not sure who, I recommend that you look into the Killers. You will not be disappointed.. or at least I hope not concidering how I've been raving about this cd for the last few lines..
B00005JN2F|4.0|It has been two years since we last saw Jason Bourne (Damon), and in that time he has been trying to live a &quot;normal&quot; life with his girlfriend Marie (Potente) in India. But quickly, two things go wrong for him. First, someone has killed a CIA agent and planted clues that point to Bourne as the murderer. Second, an assassin has arrived in India to kill him.<br /><br /> While dodging the assassin, he attempts to track down the CIA team that is after him. While the team leader, Pamela Landy (Allen) is new to the situation, Bourne's old boss, Ward Abbott (Cox) is also in the mix. What follows is basically a revenge movie filled with action and intense chase scenes. The final chase is expecially edge-of-your-seat cinema.<br /><br /> Almost all the cast and crew are back for the second installment of the Bourne series, and that provides a nice feeling of continuity. Certainly, the third novel in the series will be made into a movie, and hopefully the same continuity will be preserved with that one as well. Matt Damon once again is the surprising action hero, a role that one would not have thought possible of him a few years ago. Brian Cox is his usual delisiously evil self playing a character whose motives are unclear.<br /><br /> If you found &quot;The Bourne Identy&quot; entertaining, you will not be disappointed with &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot;. It is a good, smart action movie that keeps you involved from beginning to end. Bring on &quot;The Bourne Ultimatum&quot;!

B00003CXCT|5.0|I really don't understand the problem everyone has with the Special Editions. These DVD's are supposed to have some more changes that Lucas has added to help further tie them in with the prequels and fans are complaining about that now too.           Keep in mind that with the new films, the scope of Star Wars has changed dramatically. In order for the old films to appear as if they are part of the same continuity, they too must change. There's nothing wrong with that. It's an improvement.          I can understand the opinions of some fans that having Greedo shoot first or adding Jabba to A New Hope weren't the best ideas, but the changes that DID serve to enhance the films, like improved special effects, extended sequences, new locations and backgrounds are too often overlooked. The further changes to the DVD, like putting Ian McDiarmid in the role of the Emperor for The Empire Strikes Back or adding Hayden Christensen to the ending of Return of the Jedi to further tie in the old movies with the new are excellent improvements. Personally, I applaud Lucas for having the courage and taking the time and effort to re-visit these classic films and make them even better. Let's face it-these movies are old, and they show their age. To bring them up to speed with the new films, changes have to and should be made so the series looks like it is all part of a continuous whole, and not suddenly like one group of movies made now and the next three chapters looking like movies made over twenty years ago. Puppets, stop motion, and careless special effects mistakes just don't cut it anymore.           I had originally heard Lucas wasn't going to make further changes to the DVD's beyond those of the Special Editions. Now that it looks he will, I am ecstatic. I can't wait to see these great films again, and for them to be even greater now with these exciting, necessary changes.
B000021XS0|4.0|Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes From A Memory(1999). Dream Theater's fifth studio album. <br />  <br /> Ever since Dream Theater hit big with their second album Images & Words(1992), they have been gradually evolving and changing as artists, never sticking to the exact same sound twice. The third album Awake(1994) saw DT take on a darker, heavier tone than before, and the EP A Change Of Seasons(1995) had DT tackle on a massive 24-minute epic. The following year, they released the noticeably more commercial Falling Into Infinity(1996) which didn't bode very well for the band at the time. They felt unsatisfied with the outcome, so the band decided to break off and create their most progressive album yet, in the form of the famous, SFAM. <br />  <br /> Before I talk about the album itself I'd like to get something out of the way: I DO NOT think that this is the best DT album, but at the same time, it's not bad or average either. Judging by the reviews I've found here, there are two types of people: ones who love this album and hail it as the pinnacle of all music history, or the ones who bash this album needlessly because they hate DT. I come from an uncommon middle stance where I love DT and like this album a lot, but do not think of this as an absolute masterpiece either. I first got into DT with I&W, which literally blew me away upon first listen. Then I bought Awake and Train Of Thought(2003). Loved those ones too. And then came SFAM. I saw all kinds of reviews all over the place praising this release as the greatest progressive metal album of all time. Hmm... that's a pretty bold statement considering all the amazing stuff I've heard over the years, so of course with all this hype by EVERYONE, it would only set me up for disappointment on the first listen. And I was right. Initially, it didn't grab me much at all, and I didn't feel the need to give it repeated listens, but eventually over a long time I gradually grew into it. And now I like this album quite a bit. Many of the tracks on here are some of the best DT has ever conceived, while others fall a bit short. I still like and listen to I&W, Awake, WD&DU, and 6DOIT more than this one, but it's a great album once it grows on you. <br />  <br /> SFAM is an album that DT definitely had to make eventually, as evidenced from the way they indicated the I&W song Metropolis as a &quot;Part 1&quot;. Throughout the album, you'll hear familiar musical passages and lyrics taken from that song. Of course, SFAM is a fully-fledged concept album detailing the story of a man who goes to a psychotherapist to enter a dream and recall the events of a possible past life in 1928 where a woman gets murdered by his brother. It all plays out in a rock opera-style two act play with each track or two tracks covering a scene of the story. You can tell that DT were careful in crafting the music so that it directly tied in with the story, and in that aspect they were quite successful. All the bandmembers show outstanding musicianship, not always all at once, but you'll get to at least hear everyone shine somewhere. Portnoy and Petrucci are great here, though I believe they sounded better on the next album. However, Labrie and Myung are the ones who stand out the most to me on this album. One notable addition to this album is Jordan Rudess. He is definitely the most qualified keyboardist for DT as his prowess is often unmatched. Now onto the tracks: <br />  <br /> 'Regression' starts off with the psychotherapist who causes the main character Nicholas to begin dreaming, entering a brief accoustic passage with Labrie's singing. It breaks right into 'Overture 1928' and 'Strange Deja Vu' which see the classic DT sound we know and love. 'Through My Words' is a short musical interlude which leads into the awesome Queen-like 'Fatal Tragedy'. 'Beyond This Life' is interesting as well, followed by the slow and okay 'Through Her Eyes'. It picks right back up again with the two best tracks on the album, 'Home' and 'TheDance Of Eternity'. 'One Last Time' is short and slow, but sweet, while 'The Spirit Carries On' is more of a soul ballad. Not my type of song, though I can see many people enjoying it. The last track 'Finally Free' wraps things up nicely with the psychotherapist bringing Nicholas back to reality through a decent lighter prog rocker. I do find the ending to be rather odd, but whatever. I guess it fits. <br />  <br /> While this album doesn't blow me away like I&W, Awake, and 6DOIT did, and though Queensryche's Operation Mindcrime is still my all-time favorite progressive concept album, I do highly recommend you to check out SFAM and form your own opinion. Come in with an open mind, and remember that it's a great album, but don't walk in expecting it to be the best album of all time or you might be disappointed. In other words, don't listen to the reviews that bash this album, but be wary of all the constant praise as well. Just like it for what it is, as an excellent concept album that no DT fan should skip. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  <br />  <br /> Other similar albums: <br /> -'Images & Words' by DT <br /> -'6 Degrees Of Inner Turbulence' by DT <br /> -'Operation Mindcrime' by Queensryche <br /> -'Pleasant Shade Of Gray' by Fates Warning
B000068PQ0|5.0|This is the first Lips album I have purchased and I enjoyed it thouroughly on my first listen. The simplistic yet soothing melodies, as well as Mr. Coyne's upbeat, honest lyrical style, has captivated my senses. The first 6 tracks (minus Yoshimi Pt.2) are breathtaking and those that follow are far from mediocrity.<br /><br /> If youre into sheer visceral enjoyment of what you are listening to then this is the album for you. If youre into turning everything into an intellectual gamut of genres and comparative analyses then perhaps you should not be listening to music at all...go make spreadsheets or something.<br /><br /> Now, I absolutely have to see about &quot;Soft Bulletin&quot;.
B000059ZLH|3.0|DT are great. They did a great job on this concert, as they do on every show. Few people can play so well. They play live with no mistake. All of them are extremely talented. I practiced tens of hours to do some of those licks. They don't have to practice ... they know it, because they are good.  <br /> <br />But let's not talk about DT, let's talk about this DVD. <br />I might suck at playing guitar even after 20 years practice, but my a/v gear is brilliant. So i wonder, why this beautiful music sounds soo creepy? The audio is really bad. Really really bad. It's a shame. Did they hear it?  <br /> <br />I just bought this dvd. It's the first time i look at it. I think i will turn it off, and i'll put on a CD. (I have all of their CDs, all of them are high quality recordings). <br />I wonder , how .... how is it possible that a group like them sounds so bad? The mixing is good, but basically all the music is compressed. No soundstage. No dynamics. No air. No bass. No higs. Muddy. MP3s are wounderful compaired to this. <br />I'd like to turn it off, but the music itself is soooo good that i can't. I will listen it as it is. It seems to listen to my grandma's old radio.
0679746048|5.0|This is one of my favorite books of all time - if you're even *considering* buying this book, please do it!  If you're a fan of The Bell Jar, I Never Promised You a Rose Garden or other books dealing with psychology, you'll love it. <br /> <br />Girl, Interrupted will made me laugh, cry, and feel everything between!  Delving into the mind of Susanna Kayson, she describes in her memoir what it was like to live in Belmont - an expensive mental hospital - for almost two years during the 60's.  Each character is so unique and engrossing, I wasn't able to put the book down.  Now, even though I've read it so many times that the spine is wearing out, I still can't put it down once I stop!  You'll love this book to death - and knowing that it's a true story makes it that much more facsinating.
B0002EXH5E|5.0|Hi, this is my first review ever, and ironically the first for this title. When Dave Mustaine finished production on the album RISK, He would find that many of his original guitar parts had been replaced by producer Bud Prager from Bad Company. This upset Dave and many of the fans(including me). It was also lead guitarist Marty Friedman who wanted to take an alternative approach with the band.  <br />  <br /> Most of the Techno/Disco effects from the tracks were taken out. This is evident when you hear the first track, Insomnia.  <br />  <br /> Imsomnia- I never liked this song until I heard the remaster. I used to hate the techno effects. But some of its still there.  <br />  <br /> 8.5/10 <br />  <br /> Prince of Darkness- Another track i never particulary cared for. But much better now for some reason. I still cant put my finger on it.  <br />  <br /> 8/10 <br />  <br /> Enter The Arena- Nothing to review here. Just fans chanting &quot;Crush, Crush!&quot; An Intro to the next song.  <br />  <br /> Crush Em- I always liked this better than that stupid Gary Glitter song. A great song for when your home team scores!  <br />  <br /> 9/10  <br />  <br /> Breadline- The catchy chorus, the catchy solo by Dave. Plus a new cool intro. My Favorite On the Album! <br />  <br /> 10/10 <br />  <br /> The Doctor Is Calling- Probaly the heaviest track on the cd. Very Dark Riff just brings you in to this Metal Masterpeice.  <br />  <br /> 10/10 <br />  <br /> Ill be There- Decent song. I never cared for the chorus. But cool nonetheless  <br />  <br /> 8/10 <br />  <br /> Wanderlust- I like the mid eastern + wierd feel the album has. The Chorus is especially Catchy. I love it, always have.  <br />  <br /> Ecstacy-Very cool acoustic guitar during the verses. Nothing like any of their other songs.  <br />  <br /> 9/10 <br />  <br /> Seven- A pretty wierd riff in a very wierd song. I never listened to it much but its not bad.  <br />  <br /> 8/10 <br />  <br /> Time: The beginning- An honest song here. Time catches up to all of us. Dave can't be a 28 year old playing RIP Songs forever.  <br />  <br /> 10/10 <br />  <br /> Time:The End- Very different to the beginning but its about the same thing, accept here the Reaper confronts him.  <br />  <br /> 9/10 <br />  <br /> Overall the bonus tracks are pretty cool to. This is definatly different from the original. A must have! <br />

1586210912|1.0|Kiyosaki is a mediocre story teller at best and an even worse financial/life adviser.  I'm no expert but I suspect he suffers from multiple personality disorders.  It's obvious that all the stuff he talks about his rich dad and Mike and himself are made B.S.  The materials reads/sounds like as if 4(the 2-dads, Mike and him) of his multiple personalities are talking to one another and he has the insight and bravado to put it down on paper and make a fortune out of it.  Someone once told me that if you package feces right, you can sell it.  Kiyosaki's books are proof of that. <br /> <br />PZ

0385510438|4.0|I wouldn't call this book amazing, just because I read THE RAINMAKER before I read this one. Although this book did not have the same thrilling-suspense like some of his other books, it still maintained the Grisham cliche courtroom drama we've grown to love. But what it also adds is his amazing descriptive ability to actually bring the reader inside the book and make them feel like they are a citizen of the town standing right behind the main character, watching every move he makes. You want the book to move on, you don't care if anything exciting happens, you jsut want to know what's going to happen tomorrow in Clanton. This book was beautifully written and deserves no less than 3 stars on ANY review.
B0001GL3KE|5.0|This heartwarming story brings together everyone's favorite time of year and some of everyone's favorite actors.  I loved this movie because it was entirely about that that mystifies us so much that we have to read about it, and watch it.  There's so much in this movie that makes you feel fuzzy and warm inside.  I absolutely loved this movie!  I definately recommend it!
B000148KK2|1.0|... and, unfortunately, this thing swings about as much as Ben Stein on 'ludes. My advice to Diana: don't allow yourself to become influenced by Elvis Costello's vision of what direction you should take your music and get back to what people have come to expect from you - don't fall into the trap of becoming a self-indulgent artiste. Your fanbase really isn't interested in listening to Tom Waits, Joni Mitchell or, for that matter, Elvis Costello interpretations. My advice to you: don't waste your money - this disc is nothing more than a misguided attempt at becoming hip with the Elvis Costello crowd. Perfect for slingshot practice.
0812523334|5.0|Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but &quot;Little Women&quot; retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of &quot;Little Women&quot; come alive.<br /><br /> The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, &quot;poor little rich boy&quot; Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.<br /><br /> The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.<br /><br /> There's a clearly autobiographical tone to &quot;Little Women.&quot; Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- &quot;scribbling&quot; down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.<br /><br /> Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But &quot;Little Women&quot; is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.<br /><br /> Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as &quot;heartwarming&quot; stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.<br /><br /> Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the &quot;perfect little homemaker&quot; image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.<br /><br /> &quot;Little Women&quot; is one of those rare period novels that is still relevant, funny, and heartbreaking today. Fun, sweet, and a beautiful experience.stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well.

0553573403|5.0|This book kept me up nights. The story is so well developed and the characters so complex I couldn't stop reading it. George R. R. Martin is, in my eyes, the best fantasy writer on the market today. Long live the king!
B00003CXGG|3.0|I owe Jet an apology.I saw Cradle 2 The Grave in March and trashed it in a review.TV Guide described C2G as a derivative thriller,and now I see why,it ripped so much from Romeo and Exit Wounds,it was a perfect cookie cutter movie.I still think C2G was a bad movie and everyone that was involved in it and this movie took a major step down,but I now do think Jet has some acting ability,as he demonstrated in Romeo.Romeo is a hip hop/martial arts version of Romeo and Juliet,and although the story was not a believeable one,but it was written well enough to keep you guessing who was up to what.Jet played the imprisoned former cop who escaped from jail in Hong Kong to find the killer of his brother and he has the chops to came off as a likeable character.Aaliyah played his love interest.She was good in the role.It's a shame she died tragically,she could have went on to become a decent actress.Anthony Anderson played a comic relief role as a body guard,and DMX played a believable part for once as a night club owner.The rest of the cast really did not impress me,interchangeable Asians and blacks to play the stereotyped gangsters,but they really played secondary roles.I would not recommend buying this,but as a rental you could do worse
0765310015|3.0|This book had lots of plots and subplots. There is lots of action in this one from start to finish. I would have given it 4 stars if not for the same things mention in the first review. I hate when authors kill characters and then magically bring them back.
B0002KQNJU|5.0|Speaking only as a fan of this movie and not wanting to get into any technical aspects, this is a very charming movie that really deserves better than it's been treated. While some may deride this as fluff and a showcase for Sharon Tate or, even worse, a mediocre attempt at broad humor by Polanski, it is none of those. It's clever, witty and very dry in it's humor.       \\"Oy, have you got the wrong vampire.\\" Teases Shagal.      As a nine year old, when this was released, I did not get that at all. But later I noticed this type of causual and sardonic humor was peppered throughout the dialog. You just have to catch it. This movie suffers with a cropped version. Every inch of the screen is used here. From the crowd at the Inn to the vampire's ball, you need to see this in it's original format. For years the only available widescreen version has been on laser disc, although a Brazilian DVD has surfaced using the same transfer. Comparing all formats, it's no wonder fans have been screaming for a decent print of this film. Warners has the masters, so they should be releasing a very good looking DVD.      So, a review. A very unique and different vampire movie. Yes, I know, they all say that. But in 1967, it was. Having nothing to do with Dracula, who's story had been flogged to death even back then, or horrible family curses, it showed a completely different history of vampirism. This played on a double bill with \\"House Of Dark Shadows\\", which scared me to death, and was a great counterpoint to the serious attitude of the legend. Roman Polanski is a very good actor. His scene with the count's son still kills me to this day. He is also a great director who can work with seasoned actors and get great perfomances from them.      Why is this a cult movie and sometimes panned? Who knows. Perhaps coming after two intense and psychologically dramatic movies this shocked and disappointed people in the same way his Pirates did. Speilberg had his 1941, which I thought was brillant, so it seems certain expectations are demanded of directors. You can't please everyone, so why try? Because you're creative and can't help yourself. That's why a movie like Fearless Vampire Killers exsists.
1594200106|4.0|I really liked this book, although I found the beginning kind of slow-going. This could've been my fault, though. I'm glad I stuck with it...this is by far one of the best books I've read in a long time.
B000002G23|5.0|I grew up listening to the Every Breath You Take: The Classics album, and never knew that the version of Don't Stand So Close to Me on it was not the original. After reading many reviews, it appears as though I am the only Police fan in the world who enjoys it!<br /><br /> More importantly, however, is the fact that I also seem to be the only person in the world who has noticed a glaring glitch in the original version of the song. At 20 seconds, there is a distracting click/pop sound. The error is on the cut from this album (disc 2; track 11) and also on The Classics album (track 5). Interestingly, the pop/click is not on the cut from The Very Best of Sting & The Police (track 16).<br /><br /> Also, because I grew up listening to the Classics album, I was a little dissapointed that the New Classic Rock Mix of Message in a Bottle was excluded from this &quot;Complete Recordings&quot; box set. They had to realize that by bragging that everything was included, fans would scrutinze the track listing to ensure they really put it all in!
B000000OQF|5.0|I write this review for Appetite for Destruction because of a special I just saw on VH1. This was an amazing album, the way Slash played guitar and Axel's singing here are legendary. I begin to see how without hearing this album and understanding it people become fans of bands like Linkin Park or Staind, you simply have missed out on such an extraordinary piece of music and your just ignorant to how good its been done before. Sweet Child of Mine is one of the greatest songs I've ever heard and this VH1 special made me look back at the first few times I heard it with such fond memories that I had to rush to the keyboard and write a review. I especially love when the time change occurs towards the end of the song and Axel howels out \\"where do we go now\\" and Slash starts ripping into guitar solos. Pure magic. Its a shame not everyone hears this magic. More of a tragedy actually. Appetite for Destruction is absent of a single flaw from beginning to end, this topples anything GNR or Metallica does in the 90s or since 1988, really my love affair with the two bands ends with And Justice for All, maybe the end just occured right in the middle of Oakland at Day on the Green. I miss the genious that went into these two bands back then.
B0002EXH54|5.0|All I can say is WOW.. Dave Mustaine really took his time to remaster his whole back catalog and it shows. I'm not going to go into detail of each song, because if you like metal or music in general then you should have already heard this album. STOP READING AND JUST BUY THE ALBUM!!! All the songs sound amazing, and the quality is incredible. Each song sounds like a new experience now, I was extremely surprised to hear the bass guitar in a few of the songs! STOP READING AND JUST BUY THE ALBUM!!!  The bonus tracks are different mixes of a few songs. The liner notes are good explaining the history of megadeth up to that point and some of the writing process. <br /> <br />It goes unsaid that this is a must buy for both metalheads and Megdeth fans. STOP READING AND JUST BUY THE ALBUM!!!  One of the best albums of all time with better production than most albums today. <br /> <br />Don't think about it just buy it...
B000244EMO|5.0|Predator is about as testosterone supercharged as you could possibly get in a movie. Every actor is pumped up. It has tough dialogue, big guns, and lots of macho action. Throw in a cool alien with amazing special effects and you have pure guy movie nirvana. It doesn't hurt matters that it was the film that John McTiernan directed right before making Die Hard. It established that he could really handle action. <br />  <br /> The cast of this film was perfect. It was a real ensemble piece with Schwarzenegger in the lead. In fact, I think Arnold was helped tremendously by the additional cast. He didn't have to carry the whole movie on his shoulders and they helped elevate the level of acting and characterization. You had Carl Weathers as the CIA agent. He seems more than a physical match for Schwarzenegger and he definitely acts better. You also had Bill Duke as Sgt. 'Mac' Eliot. His quiet, intense gaze said more than anything else he did. You had Jesse Ventura playing the tough, tobacco chewing, gun toting guy who ain't got time to bleed&quot;. (Did Ventura inspire Arnold to be a governor, too?) You had American Indian Sonny Landham as Billy, the guy with the haunting laugh. Then there was Richard Chaves as Poncho Ramirez who was also a favorite of mine. <br />  <br /> The effects of Predator were also remarkable. Not only was the camouflage effect unique but the alien makeup itself was stunning. The alien was definitely a guy in a rubber mask, but the helmet, dreadlocks, and mandibles made him one of the more amazing looking aliens in movie history. Everything about the Predator was just cool. The character was a real high point in Stan Winston's career. <br />  <br /> The music by Alan Silvestri was also unique and a perfect blend of military march and horror suspense to give the movie the right feel. <br />  <br /> This is one of those rare movies where everything came together just right to make a fun film. The actors, director, effects, music, and everything fittogether just right to make one of the best popcorn flicks ever made. <br /> the extras  <br /> The Extras: <br /> This is about the third or fourth edition of the Predator DVD. I don't have the others, so I can't compare this edition to them. However, it is a big treat for any Predator fan. It's on par with the Alien collector editions that recently came out. There are a ton of extras and bonus features that I had never seen before. Here are the highlights: <br />  <br /> Commentary by John McTiernan - This commentary by the director is admittedly a bit dry. McTiernan comes across as a little flaky, but he does have all sorts of interesting trivia about the film. However, I don't think I learned much from the commentary that I didn't get from the other featurettes on the DVD. <br />  <br /> Text commentary - If you turn on this option, subtitles appear on the screen. They are apparently transcribed commentary from the sound effects guys, some actors, editors, and other crew members. It's interesting, but it's a little distracting to have their conversations appearing as text on the bottom of the screen. I think I would have preferred an audio commentary. However, it is full of all sorts of Predator trivia that's quite interesting. Predator fans might find one or two new things here they haven't heard before. <br />  <br /> Deleted scene: Arnold Schwarzenegger Fleeing Predator - In this deleted scene, Arnie hides under a log from the Predator and is covered in ants. He then runs and dodges explosions in the jungle as he runs from the Predator. The scene ultimately isn't that great and is not missed from the film. <br />  <br /> &quot;If It Bleeds, We Can Kill It&quot; documentary - This is an extended documentary on the making of the film. It's about 30 minutes long. It shows interviews with the cast and crew from the 80's and more recently. You learn the origins of the script, what it was like filming in the jungle, and more. It's an excellent documentary. <br /><br /> Inside the Predator: seven featurettes - These are a series of 3 to 10 minute short features on various subjects. They include the special weapons from the film, the casting, the camouflage makeup, the Predator suit, Kevin Peter Hall, shooting in the jungle, and more. I was really surprised to see that the Predator in the film wasn't the original one they had in mind. It was originally more bug-like and it looked quite stupid on film. It was good to see they went with the design they did. You also learn that the film was originally called &quot;Hunter&quot; rather than &quot;Predator&quot;. Again, there are all sorts of cool stuff for Predator fans here. <br />  <br /> Three outtakes - One &quot;outtake&quot; shows Anna picking up a chameleon in the forest. Another shows Dutch preparing for battle with the Predator. I don't even recall the third one if that tells you anything. They are all better left on the cutting room floor. <br />  <br /> Three Predator &quot;red suit&quot; special effects - In order to make the camouflage effect in the film, they had the alien actor in a big red suit that was optically removed later. These show the original shots of the suit. Even the cheesy original alien is shown here. <br />  <br /> Two Predator camouflage tests - This shows the various camouflage effects they tried before settling on the one seen in the film. These tests happen to use the footage of the original sucky alien. <br />  <br /> Alien vs. Predator and I, Robot sneak peeks - These are quick sneak peeks of AVP and I, Robot. The AVP one is only around 2 minutes long, but you get to see the mechanical alien, the making of the Predator helmets, and more. It's fun stuff. <br />  <br />  <br />
0375703764|5.0|This book only appears to be 'complicated.'  When my friend showed it to me, I said 'no way' at first as well.  But after her book-ly naggings, I picked it up from the library, and ended up buying it as well. <br /> <br />I think I read it in...2 days?... maybe, which may seem slow to you zealots out there.  But I was absolutely engrossed.  The way the pages are laid out actaully helps you really to 'feel' the book.   <br /> <br />I think 'pretentious' is a pretty poor way to describe this book.  The plot and ideas aren't that esoteric to where you can't understand what's going on...at least by the time you are halfway through the book (granted, the begninning is a bit muddled).  It's just something where everything falls together later on.   <br /> <br />Skimming through random pages does give a rather intimidating, or at least irritated 'i am not going to squint for all that type' effect, but most of it is just scenery; i think this book is an excelent choice, if you have the time to focus on it <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JMEW|4.0|Quentin Tarantino's fourth film is his love letter to the 70's Kung Fu movies that he cherishes so much. The music, sound effects, camerawork, dialogue, and stunts are all directly from those cheesy flicks from way back when. But Tarantino doesn't stop at just borrowing from the Kung Fu genre. He also borrows from Samurai flicks, exploitation films, Yakuza movies, Westerns, and even anime. Because of that, Kill Bill ends up being a really weird movie. Your enjoyment of Kill Bill Vol. 1 will depend heavily on how much you appreciate a good homage to those films. Though I'm not a big fan of any of these kinds of movies, I still appreciated what Tarantino was doing and I enjoyed Kill Bill Vol. 1 quite a bit. <br />  <br /> Kill Bill's greatest strength and its greatest weakness is the action and violence. The film is filled with cool fight scenes. The best fight of the movie features Uma Thurman battling the Crazy 88's, a gang of sword wielding Japanese thugs. The fight choreography is amazing and the swordfights are some of the best ever seen on film. There's also a spectacular knife fight in a kitchen between Vivica A Fox and Thurman. It is tough, bloody, and brutal. It's awesome stuff. However, as anyone familiar with Tarantino knows, the fight scenes are underlined with tons of blood, shocking moments, and brutality rarely matched in today's cinema. In fact, Tarantino takes it to the far end of the spectrum to the point that it becomes parody. . There's so much blood that it becomes silly. (Believe it or not, this is what some of those old movies were like.) This violence may be a turn off to some people. <br />  <br /> The film also changes in look at a fast rate . The movie goes from color to black and white, from live action to cartoon, and from crystal clear to grainy. It's a bizarre mix, but it works in the film. Also aiding this movie is the awesome soundtrack. It's an eclectic mix of tunes featuring everyone from Nancy Sinatra to a Japanese surf band to Wu Tang Clan's Rza. I particularly liked the music from the trailer (also heard in the club scene) which I believe if from Rza as well. <br />  <br /> Kill Bill also has a wicked sense of humor. There are hilarious moments all through the film. It's this kind of one-two punch of horror and comedy that makes Kill Bill unique. <br />  <br /> Uma Thurman is incredible as The Bride. She's tough, intelligent, and someone you wouldn't want to cross. Her stunts and swordwork and very impressive as well. She really makes you believe she could do many of the stunts she performs. Vivica A. Fox also comes out of nowhere as Vernita Green and does impressive stuff. She switches from DiVA assassin to soccer mom with amazing ease. She, too, does some impressive fight work in her showstopping fight scene with Uma. Chiaki Kuriyama is also cool as Go Go Yubari.  <br /> One of the other major handicaps of Kill Bill Vol. 1 is its length. It is cut abruptly short with a cliffhanger ending that leads you into Kill Bill Vol. 2. From a business standpoint, it's a good move. People who enjoyed the first will be back to buy tickets for the second. From a storytelling standpoint, I think the film could have been trimmed down and all been fit into one movie. It would have been a lot more satisfying story, I think. <br />
B0001UL7RY|4.0|i listen to a massive variety , so hers my thoughts/opinions..<br /><br />Its pretty sad when everyone thinks their opinion is unique when they all sound the same . The average avril basher is a snot nosed teen who thinks he/she is punk cause he/she listens to the clash and pop punk music of the sort .very funny . Ive listened to this cd and for a pop alternative cd it comes through nicely . It has your reapeat loops but dont be so quick to bash this cd . It has some powerful lyrics that are short yet sweet . I dont think people are looking/listening closer than they should . aside from the trendy bashing of this artist ive noticed this thing avril does in her songs . its this motivation she brings out that i think if anything is going to be mainstream it should atleast be positive .which this is. If youre only listening to the singles and think you know this artist .. well youre wrong . also , i can tell by the comments of bashers cause all they seem to be commenting is on the singles and what does this mean kiddies ... they infact watch mtv or listen to the radio more than the average avril fan who buys the cd's and has been to the concerts . so they lie and what do we call liars ... posers .
B0001XAPX8|3.0|I wasn't sure what to expect with The Human Stain when it arrived. On the one hand, it had probably one of the worst movie titles I've ever heard. On the other hand, it featured some of my favorite actors - Anthony Hopkins, Nicole Kidman, Gary Sinese, and Ed Harris. But on the down side the trailers ruined most of the movie. Throw on top of that the fact that it's a dark, depressing character drama and not even the stellar cast could make this movie enjoyable for me. <br /> <br />The Human Stain is a really depressing movie. Every character in the film is depressed, tortured, or otherwise put through emotional hell at one point or another. It's a bit intense and not for you if you're looking for some light entertainment. <br /> <br />The script is pretty good. The story jumps back and forth in time and features Silk as both a young man and an older man. (I personally found the less star powered tales from his youth to be more interesting.) There is also some pretty good dialogue offered. However, it has some problems. It asks the audience to take some pretty big leaps in believability. First of all, we're asked to believe that Anthony Hopkins is a light skinned black person. (And that secret was ruined in the trailers early on, another bad mark against The Human Stain.) Believing Hopkins is black makes about as much sense as believing he's Hispanic. (Zorro, anyone?) As much as I like Hopkins, someone else should have been cast as Silk. The second big leap in logic is the fact that Silk, a highly educated older professor, would fall for an uneducated, psychologically tortured character like Faunia. I can't see the two falling for each other under many real world circumstances. And any time a character in the film suggests that it has something to do with sex, Silk flies into a rage. Well, seeing as how most of the time they are only shown in bed together, that seems like the only explanation. They certainly don't seem to have any other believable connection. My finalgripe on the script is that it repeatedly mentions the Bill Clinton / Monica Lewenski scandal. It seemed to be trying to offer some sort of commentary on the subject, but I never quite figured out what it was. It seemed to be saying that the whole incident was trivial, but I wasn't sure. <br /> <br />Despite not being black, Anthony Hopkins does a pretty good job as Coleman Silk. He has no problem portraying the intellectual side of the character. He also doesn't seem to have any problem playing the horny old man side, either. Nicole Kidman goes through an impressive trailer trash transformation as Faunia Farley. Kidman is good at playing the tortured soul and that's what she does here (along with having a surprising number of nude scenes). Ed Harris is also good at playing the psychotic Lester Farley while Gary Sinise plays the straight man and narrator as Nathan Zuckerman. However, I was very much impressed with Wentworth Miller as Young Coleman Silk. He imitated Hopkins fairly well and he's a handsome young actor who I could see taking on larger roles. I found the scenes where he turns his back on his family and race to be the best of the movie. <br /> <br />The Human Stain is also a good looking film. The backgrounds and sets are beautiful and the camera flatters all of the actors. A good film score also helps to elevate the film. It's fortunate that The Human Stain had these things going for it along with the excellent cast, because otherwise it would even worse. In the end the excellent cast helps raise the quality up a bit, but not enough to sell me on it. <br />
B0000DD7LB|1.0|This album is a complete joke.  If you research the album credits (oddly they don't disclose them here, maybe because it would effect sales?) it took more people to put out this album than those needed to fill out an orchestra.  Whatever happened to the band, sitting down with one sound engineer and one producer to produce an album of exceptional quality?  Instead now you get an exceptional number of people who put out an album that by all reasonable standards is a complete waste of airtime?  Why does it take an army of people to make her sound good?

0684833395|4.0|That catch-22 is a very funny and insane book. Why i say it is insane is because it reveal the truth about the Wars an the views of Men. The characters in the book are in the War but non of them knows why they are there fighting so they are totally crazy as they are flying to bomb and kill the people. The main character, Yossarians, is the one we can say is the craziest of all, but,in my opinion,he is the one with the clearest state of mind to judge the war. Because he is the one who is trying to avoid the wars and refuse to fly. Milo who is a mess officer who is trying to do business out of the war and really make popular and success in the book. And the other characters are also very interesting and make you to think that if it is possible that people who in the war really look like them. The most interesting of all is &quot;the catch&quot; that is catch-22 in which people are trapped. It says, &quot;Yossarrians can be allowed to stop flying if he is crazy but then he has to ask the doctor to ground him, then he is not crazy when is asked then he can not be grounded.&quot; Isn't it crazy and confused? <br /> As the story goes on, the real purpose of the wars is becoming more clear, the more the stupid the wars become, and the sad the story become.  <br /> As an Asian, I found that book is really difficult to understand but it will become more and more interesting and exciting in the end. So keep reading and you will find it really funny and insane or may be sad in the end. <br />
B000286S8S|1.0|So we've all waited for how long for a new Van Halen album? Didn't Eddie say in an interview that he had written more music than he know's what to do with (or words to that effect)? And the band rewards loyal fans for waiting a VERY long time with a compilation album with three new songs. What a crock. I'm going to have to say that \\"It's About Time\\" shouldn't be on any greatest hits album. The music and lyrics are awkward - a far cry from the great tunes of the early Roth and Hagar years.

B00006X06U|5.0|There seems to be a debate going on about early Joni vs. present Joni. I grew up listening to Mitchell's music, and I love those early tunes, but I prefer the mature Joni. Travelogue and her last effort, Both Sides Now, are a couple of my favorite CDs. Her recent releases strike an emotional chord with me that the early work does not. I'm barely holding on to my 20s, but I can still relate to the life experiences in her music. I even find myself understanding her music better with these new treatments than I did with the earlier *innocent* original versions. I also think her mature voice, cigarette smoke and all, is just beautiful. I wish that this would not be her last.
0425188809|5.0|This is the best Koontz book I have ever read.  It is an oxymoronic heart warming horror novel.  I cared deeply for the characters.  The dog absolutely broke my heart and I even felt sympathy for the monster which reminds me of when I read Frankenstein.  I highly recommend this book even if you are not a fan of the genre.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I agree that this album has enough songs on it to give it 5 stars. However I also think, and avril has said this, that there are the radio friendly songs (which are the good ones), and the songs that are more rock and yelling (the ones she prefers). The best songs on this album are her two current singles (Dont tell me and My Happy Ending), also Slipped away, Fall to pieces and How does it feel. Slipped away is great and that should be the next single! OK peace out and enjoy the CD.

0553573403|5.0|A Game of Thrones is one of the best books I have ever read, and definitely the best fantasy book I have come across. Martin has created a milestone in the genre with a series that is sure to become a classic just like Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. If forced to choose between these two brilliant authors, I'd choose Martin ten times our of ten.
B000089RVX|4.0|I purchased Fallen back in March of last year and loved it at first. Amy's voice is spectacular and Ben's guitar work, while basic, just sounds good. <br /> <br />However, I recently purchased Comalies by Lacuna Coil, and it totally blew me away.  Christina Scabbia has a beautiful voice, different than Amy's (she actually sounds like Madonna on a couple songs).  But the music with Lacuna Coil is so much more complex and just better. <br /> <br />And if you have not seen Christina, you will blown away as much from her looks as her voice.   <br /> <br />I would recommend buying both, but bottom line is, Lacuna Coil is just a better CD.  But they are much less commercial than Ev, and I doubt if you be hearing them on top 40 radio ever.  <br /> <br />I am not bashing Evanescence either. Just give LAcuna a listen
0375703764|4.0|Let's get this out of the way right now: House of Leaves can be called pretentious, art-wrecked, over-the-top, and poisoned by the pop era mentality. I say &quot;can be.&quot; Consider it this way: harlequin romance novels &quot;can be&quot; cheesy, overdone, melodramatic crap, but there are people out there (lonely and/or horny people) to whom the books fullfill a very specific need. All art has its patrons. Even &quot;Jackass&quot; has its fans.<br /><br /> To that end, for those of you looking for some complex brain cud to chew on for a while, here's the book you've been looking for. The only thing that makes House of Leaves &quot;pretentious&quot; is its intelligence. The only thing that makes it &quot;art-wrecked&quot; is its multi-tiered narration (it is, literally, a story within a story within a story within a story). The only thing that makes it &quot;over-the-top&quot; is its self-imploding nature and its grandiose goals. The only reason it could be called &quot;poisoned by the pop era&quot; is because it is informed by the need to preach to short attention spans with cultural references and the type of &quot;cool for cool's sake&quot; attitude that pervades most middle-class entertainment.<br /><br /> To that end, if you are an impatient, straightforward type of person, you will be annoyed by House of Leaves. Not only does it contain six or seven different (albeit partially connected) stories, but these stories are so intricately woven together, that even the text itself curves on the page, appears upside down, is actually woven sideways and slantways and backways. Literally. If you read this straight through, you will be holding the book upside down at one point.<br /><br /> At its core, the story is about a house that is bigger on the inside than it is on the outside, a tale that, were it isolated, would've fit nicely on the shelves next to &quot;Carrie&quot; and &quot;It.&quot; (Stephen King himself is actually &quot;interviewed&quot; in the book) If you were to only read the segments pertaining to the spooky house, you would find it legitimately creepy and unsettling, and most of the negative reviews you see online would, I'm sure, be more positive.<br /><br /> Except that this book is actually about a lot more than just an impossible house. The haunted building, in fact, is a metaphor for bigger themes, and here is where many people may be lost, or insulted, or just bored. Like the structure at its core, the book itself is much bigger inside than it appears to be (or should be, to some) on the outside. I won't attempt to detail here what I believe to be Danielewski's motives or meanings, except to point out the most obvious: that beneath the trite cliches and bubble-gum pop we embrace and he employs, we are all much bigger inside than we seem on the outside. Each of us, Danielewski seems to be saying, appears normal, but we all know that at our core, we are an endless and exhausting supply of dark rooms and incomprehensible mazes.<br /><br /> I am loathe to reduce Danielewski's intent to such pat terms, however, so I will reiterate that this book has enough meat on it for mutiple feedings; some of you, however (and if I may torture the metaphor), may find it too tough to chew.ook) If you were to only read the segments pertaining to the spooky house, you would find it legitimately creepy and unsettling, and most of the negative reviews you see online would, I'm sure, be more positive. <br />  <br /> Except that this book is actually about a lot more than just an impossible house.

B000286S8S|1.0|Well... some of the songs I like them, but I already have them... so why waste my money? Besides, I think Van Halen gave us 'the best of' them a long time ago. I have no use for the new songs, at best they sound disappointing... If you're a newcomer get and experience the band's original recordings. I like'em both, Sammy's and Dave's eras and I believe there is a lot to like back there.
006097625X|5.0|I have a very personal reason for loving this book.  When I was an undergrad at Syracuse University in the early 80's there was a crazy Art History and Aesthetics Prof named Larry Bakke, who really changed the way I looked at art and media in general.   <br /> <br />Bakke has since died and I am thrilled to find that someone who really grasped the ideas that Bakke presented has applied those ideas to comics in the media of a comic book. <br />
B00006SFLV|4.0|My So-Called Life was a show ahead of its time. The 19 eps that aired suggested a very progressive and intelligent look at a family from their high school aged daughter's view from her suburban home. <br /> <br />Whimsical, serious, hilarious and even at times morbid, the program sometimes occasionally bordered on the soapy or sometimes strayed toward the outrageous. But it tackled a lot of important topics... hand guns in school, illiteracy, sibling rivalry, extramarital affairs, homosexuality, underage drinking, adoption and, of course, sex... and they did it with thought and wit. <br /> <br />This collection of the series gives you the 19 episodes. That's it. And that's why I only gave this collection 4 and not 5 stars. I would have liked something, ANYTHING, more! Outtakes, or screen tests, or even network promos for the show! Still, the episodes are fantastic, featuring great acting from a stellar cast who were mostly unknowns at the time, that went on to become famous for their work.  <br /> <br />But television is really about the writing, and this show had brilliant writing throughout. If you've seen the show, then you already know it. If you haven't, you are in for a very big treat that will make you ask, why didn't this show make it to a second season? <br /> <br />Highly Recommended.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|I have to admit that I was very disappointed after first listen due to the changes in TNP and 5 Magics.  After all, this was my favorite album for the past 10 years of so. <br /> <br />After a few listens though, I calmed down, and nothing's going to change it being my favorite album.  This album can't be beat, changes or not. <br /> <br />Every song rules and I like the higher volume levels--could never get the sound high enough on the highway with my lousy car stereo.
B00005JN0A|5.0|When this movie came out, there were many advertisments for many different movies. The ones I were concentrating on were The Girl Next Door, Club Dread and Eurotrip. TGND and CD I thought were going to be really great movies and Eurotrip, I thought would be really stupid, but worth a look. The first two were as good as i thought they would be, but I was wrong about Eurotrip. Eurotrip has to be one of the best and funniest movies of the year. <br /> <br />The movie's about a kid fresh out of high school named Scotty who recently found out his g/f was cheating on him (the way he finds out who she was cheating on him with is one of the funniest parts of the movie). Scotty finds out that his penpal from Germany's name is pronounced Mika and not Mike (spelled Meike)and is an incredibly hot chick. Scotty decides to head off to Europe with 3 friends where they experience some really funny stuff on the way to getting Meike. <br /> <br />Overall this movie was very good and funny, unforunately I bought this movie at Wal-Mart, and they don't carry Unrated versions of any movie, so I had to settle with the R-rated version, good, none-the-less.
B000260R82|5.0|Amazon.com already includes ten complete DVD versions of Aida. My favorite is the one from the Metropolitan Opera (New York) with Aprile Millo and Placido Domingo. This latest arrival comes from Barcelona (two discs; 186 minutes; recorded live in the Gran Teatre del Liceu, Barcelona, 21-24 July, 2003). In addition to the many virtues found by the previous reviewer (J. Scott Morrison, July 13, 2004), I would summarize my overall impression as: this is a magnificent performance! It has been recorded with superb sound. The orchestra, the chorus, the rhythm adopted by the conductor and, particularly, the restored trompe-l'oeil sets from the Catalonian painter, Josep Mestres Cabanes, make you forgive and forget the limitations of this new version of Aida. In some of the scenes (particularly in the last two acts), you are able to achieve such a level of immersion in the work that you forget some of the limitations of the two principal singers (Daniela Dessi and Fabio Armilato). Elisabetta Fiorillo (Amneris) and Juan Pons (Amonasro) provide an intensity rarely seen. The DVD includes also a short documentary (10:26 minutes) about the Liceu of Barcelona (before and after its reconstruction following the fire of 1994) as well as on Josep Mestres Cabanes, the real idol of this production.
B0002BO0AS|5.0|I think this is one of the few bands that has yet to receive the recognition they deserve. Their first debut album, The Stings of Conscious was a superb first effort. Years have passed since that album met with a record label change from Eulogy to Metal Blade as well as a new drummer Mike Justain (the Red Chord). Whether you are familiar with that band or not, this guy is a pro and adds a whole new dynamic to the band. The guitar work is tight and very well done, improving even on the high standards set by TSOC. The riffs are original and melodies are excellently intertwined amongst the breakdowns. And the breakdowns are SICK - at least 2 or 3 per song and they are all unique and rhythmically tight. Just download \\"This Lying World\\" to hear what I am talking about. The vocals are also an improvement over TSOC. Trevor's lyrics have always been good but on this album they are less abstract here. Unlike a lot bands today, particularly ones in this genre, they actually sing about issues of relevance and importance, about the state of this world and where we are headed if we continue these destructive trends. No dragons or crying over ex girlfriends here. The lyrics are pissed off as all hell and it does nothing but compliment the scope of this bands' art. As far as the new record label goes, the production quality on this cd is ages ahead of what is heard on TSOC. I consider myself to be pretty picky when it comes to audio production but they got this right on. I'm making no understatement when I say the production on this cd is damn near PERFECT for this band's sound. My only complaint would be the clichd \\"soft\\" track titled \\"Aries.\\" I mean, it's good...it just seems rather out of place, same with the acoustic ending of \\"Black Hearts Now Reign.\\" This band is about brutal metalcore and this record exemplifies it by pounding you into submission. This is definitely one of the best releases this year. If you have any respect for yourself and loud music, you owe it to yourself to pick up this album.      p.s.   An open letter to heidi kakes,      Justain's talent on this album shines through just as much if not stronger than in Fused Together. Also, there aren't 10 breakdowns per song. You just couldn't handle the couple that are there.      p.p.s. using the \\"open letter format\\" in reviews is lame. If people did that in the 80's, it wasn't cool then and it isn't cool now.      Thanks,   R.V.
B00001QEBQ|4.0|Mulan is a favorite to me. it's excellent in matters of characters, making, and music. smart and funny too. but the only hitch is that I regret that I have showed it to my little ones because: <br />1- they got terrified at the shan-yu introduction scene <br />2- they learnt the skill of spitting from Mulan (tsk tsk) <br />other than that, I think it's worth the buy and a treasure of a Disney movie to keep.

Maybe I'm just being biased in my review of it because of my love for everything Ramones, but this is just a great straight forward rock & roll record. You really don,t find many albums coming out now where every track is worth while.

This album kind of tells a story from the beggining to the end. Jimi Hendrix was doing some great things in the studio and on the side he was touring. But Hendrix still had time to complete alot of the songs on this album including Freedom, and Izabella. For most this album is extra special being it was his last album that was never finished. This is more than words. Enjoy!

The worst song on this album is Shattered the rest is history.
0792101448|5.0|The VHS version I saw was a two-cassette set and was not subtitles, but in English.      Sergio Leone made a trilogy of films about the Man With No Name, starring Clint Eastwood.  The westerns were: A Fistful of Dollars (1964), For A Few Dollars More (1966), The Good, The Bad and the Ugly (1966).    Sergio Leone's follow-up film is this one: Once Upon A Time In The West (1968).  The all-star western epic includes the cast of Charles Brosnan, Jack Elam, Henry Fonda, Claudia Cardinale, Lionel Stander, Jason Robards Jr and Keenan Wynn.  (There is not Clint Eastwood).    This set is the original uncut version running at 2 hours, 45 minutes.    Henry Fonda is a real cold-hearted killer in this one.  Quite disturbing!  For a lighter western that you can laugh at, may I recommend, [[ASIN:B0007M21Z8 My Name Is Nobody]] (1973) starring Terence Hill and Henry Fonda.    Claudia Cardinale also was in THE PINK PANTHER (1964) and SON OF THE PINK PANTHER (1993).

0380002930|5.0|I was not supposed to like this book.  I don't read fiction.  I certainly would not read a book about the life of a bunch of rabbits.  Fortunately, I was forced to read it.  It was required reading.  My approach to required reading is this; I read a couple book reviews and the notes inside the cover.  I then read the first couple chapters and then the last chapter.  I wrap it up by listening to my other classmates talk about the book.  I am very good at it and everybody thinks I have read these silly books.  My plan didn't work with this book because after I read the first couple chapters I could not put it down.  I just had to know what happened to these rabbits next.  I told myself I would just read a little more to see what happens next.  I kept saying that until I finished the book.  It was absolutely outstanding!!
B00006AW2S|5.0|Out Of Our Heads is the Rolling Stones second album. I have the US copy which is much better than the UK version. The difference is they cut out songs on the UK version, the american version has different tracks. I think the best song on this album would have to be Satisfaction. This is one of my favorite early recordings. I have the 1986 version on abkco, if your wondering the 86 US version is the best. Enjoy~!
B000BTC5LW|3.0|Of all the Pink Floyd concerts I have on DVD (Pink Floyd - Live at Pompeii, Roger Waters - In the Flesh Live, Roger Waters - The Wall live in Berlin, Pink Floyd - Pulse) this one would be last on my list. I searched far and wide to get my hands on this rare, limited release DVD. After watching it I think it's somewhat over-hyped on this and other review websites. Here's the main problem: I'm trying to watch my favorite band perform live... could you please get that obnoxious giant circular video screen out of my line of vision!! That's right folks - throughout this concert footage there are two main camera perspectives: One is a wide shot that is so distant in order to frame the gigantic circular video screen that you can't really see the band, and the other is more close up. But wait there's a catch. In the close up footage the producers have decided to superimpose that giant circular video screen again. It's baaaack. When viewing my monitor during these scenes I estimate that David Gilmour gets to occupy about 1/5th of the overall image. In fact, most of the time he is literally partially cut out and hidden behind this thing. It's really bizarre. It's as if the producers are demanding that we watch their 'cool' film clips instead of the band. These clips run the gamut from the usual psychedelics to actual newsreel footage (some of which include images of George Bush, Bill Clinton, Vladimir Putin, Tony Blair etc. - Gee, that's something I look forward to in my Pink Floyd concert experience). In all fairness the camera does occasionally go up on stage and roam amongst the band. But even here the cinematographers were trying to be really fancy and used blurring effects, overexposure and monochrome lighting and it just didn't work well. When the credits rolled I couldn't remember 'seeing' this band.<br /><br />The performances are lackluster and I'm sorry to say that that includes Gilmour (oh no, here comes the wave of public anger and hostility). When the accompanying lead guitarist takes the spotlight he takes too many liberties (see Another Brick in the Wall when he decides to do some Eddie Van Halen-esq fret tapping... c'mon). Unlike other Floyd concerts I own, the backup female vocalists don't get a lot of attention. Perhaps that's not so bad because also unlike other Floyd concerts I own, here they are not as remarkable.<br /><br />I must agree with others who have reviewed this concert and say it is a grand production. The light show, the pyrotechnics, the enormous props... amazing. But as concert performance and as an overall concert experience captured on film, this is a disappointment. Granted, the encore does indeed build to a stunning climax, but if you're a huge Floyd'o'phile like I am, be prepared to endure some frustration to get there.g lead guitarist takes the spotlight he takes too many liberties (see Another Brick in the Wall when he decides to do some Eddie Van Halen-esq fret tapping... c'mon). Unlike other Floyd concerts I own, the backup female vocalists don't get a lot of attention. Perhaps that's not so bad because also unlike other Floyd concerts I own, here they are not as remarkable.<br /><br />I must agree with others who have reviewed this concert and say it is a grand production. The light show, the pyrotechnics, the enormous props... amazing. But as concert performance and as an overall concert experience captured on film, this is a disappointment. Granted, the encore does indeed build to a stunning climax, but if you're a huge Floyd'o'phile like I am, be prepared to endure some frustration to get there.
B00000DGUG|5.0|This album is my favorite one out of the four that Alanis has offered. Every single song captures me and drags me into them, where I get lost amongst creative words, a beautiful voice and awesome music that somehow travels up my spine and makes me feel really good. Mm..    When I first owned this album, the only song that I would listen to over and over again, was Thank U. I could not fall out of love with that song. I wasn't giving the other songs a chance. I was too afraid. Now that I am sixteen, I've broken that barrier. I've taken in more things. These songs are so amazing and so beautiful. They touch my heart and moves it.    What I love most about this album, are her lyrics. Very creative. There is still some anger, some pain. But, three years after her album, Jagged Little Pill, she's changed. She's made it even more beautiful than it was on Jagged Little Pill. I just love listening to this album with my eyes closed, at night, in my bed. It really relaxes me. Thank U, Alanis.
B0000CFW87|5.0|When compared to Josh Groban's first CD, there is so much more artistry and maturity in this recording, with more depth to his voice, and sincerity of emotion. This is a truly beautiful offering, much in the same vein as the Andrea Bocelli discs, with glorious melodies and romantic lyrics.<br /><br />'Mi Mancherai' from the film 'Il Postino', features Joshua Bell on violin, and in 'Remember the Rain' we get to hear Josh on piano for the first time in a recording, in a song he co-wrote. He also had a hand in 'Per Te', and 'Never Let Go', which he sings with Deep Forest. 'You Raise Me Up' was a # 1 hit and in the charts for months, as well as this album, which has gone multi-platinum.<br /><br />Working once again with David Foster, there are lush arrangements and excellent musicianship, and Josh's gorgeous voice with its power and huge range will delight anyone who likes the 'opera light' type of music. For his youth, Josh is remarkable, and one can only imagine the career that lies ahead of him, as a charismatic performer and marvelous singer, and a young man with a style and look all his own.<br /><br />Favorites include 'My Confession', and I never tire of hearing Lucio Dalla's 'Caruso', no matter who is singing it, and Josh's interpretation is wonderful, and one of the best.<br /><br />Five songs are sung in Italian, one in Spanish and one in French, all well enough enunciated so that I find them understandable.<br /><br />The booklet insert has the lyrics in their original languages, and some nice photography, and total playing time is 59'02.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Big fish is truely a Forrest Gump style movie; in the idea that the father tells outragus stories that are too strange to believe, but near the end of the show you see that most of his stories were much more real than belived. This is realy a must see movie!
6300182193|4.0|At the end when we see &quot;Dracula&quot; fly off we aren't sure what we see. It could just be Lucy's delusion we're seeing. Hey she just came back from being a Vampire herself you know. More likely though it's just Dracula's cape flying away in the wind without him in it.
B0000027RL|5.0|Many people think this album is overrated. I definitely disagree with that statement, since this is pure and candid rock'n'roll at it's best. It's not pretentious, it has great riffs and enthusiastic vocals. 'Even Flow' is one of the most inspired songs ever composed with it's gloomy and at the same time uplifting melody. All PJ's albums are good. This one is flawless!

Death are f*cking gods mannnnnn!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00008EY65|4.0|I passed on seeing 'Hellboy' in the theatre for one reason. Every comic book movie excluding the 'Spider-man' and 'X-Men' films have lived up to expectations. I was certainly surprised when I read quite positive reviews for the film. I picked up the dvd the other day to see what all the buzz was about, and I was pleasantly surprised. Director Guillermo Del Toro(Blade II) did an excellent job bringing this hero to life. Using the right amount of humor, action, and a great introduction film, 'Hellboy' was great. Ron Perlman was quite fun to watch, and it was nice to see this veteran actor finally land a starring role. While this film may not be quite as good as films such as the forementioned 'Spiderman' and 'X-men,' 'Hellboy' succeeds in all the right facets and hopefully del Toro can further the series along with a sequel. 'Hellboy' is worth checking out and even if you have doubts like I did, you may be surprised at how much fun this film is to watch.
B00011F5DK|5.0|A friend, who knows we love games in our family, bought us this. Well, within a day we all were hooked. my 5 year old and 12 year old can play with my husband and me and we all are challenged and have a blast! i bought a set to bring to our family vacation home, and my sister in law and i were up until midnight every nite for a week playing this game with whomever we could snag to play it with us!! even really little kids have fun just playing with the pieces, not actually playing the game. the only caveat I have is DON'T LOSE ANY PIECES!!!!! all of the pieces are critical to the game.. that is a real challenge in our household!!
1592400876|5.0|Why can't all educational nonfiction be this entertaining? If Truss can do this with a subject as unpromising as punctuation it ought to be possible with any subject. Not only is this book just plain fun to read, the author has a knack for explanations that immediately make one's light bulb go on: For anyone who doubts that the movie title Two Weeks Notice needs an apostrophe, she simply asks if one can give One Week Notice. She also has an ingenious way of building examples right into her explanations. I often had the feeling that there was cleverness going on here that I wasn't even aware of. <br />  <br />I was a little concerned at first that this was a British book but impressed that the publisher declined to revise it for U.S. publication. Truss is careful to point out differences with American usage, anyway, and the mother-tongue perspective is actually another of the book's charms. Finally, despite her consistently funny viewpoint, I think she achieves a more serious end with her many illustrations of the improbable power of these nonverbal squiggles, dots, and lines to convey subtle shades of meaning. It seems miraculous, really, that we can communicate so much with so little when both writer and reader are paying attention.
B000286S8S|5.0|i was so happy when i heard van halen was touring again , those guys rock they havent missed a beat and sammy can still hit those high notes, eddie he is so awsome , alex drumming is so tight and so tasty not the same beat its always a surprise ,michael hes one mean guy on bass i dont think he ever puts that bass down . again to all the van halen fans and i mean the true fans van halen is back yessssssssss, lets push for another new cd guys with all new tracks .YOU GUYS ROCK , DONT STOP
B0002EXH54|5.0|This is the first cd I listened to out of my set of remasters I purchased. This is the cd that put Megadeth on the map so to speak. Dave Mustaine did a fabulous job on this cd. It just sounds incredible! I remember when this cd first came out when I was 16 and in high school. Someone I knew at school lent me his copy and I thought it was an awesome CD. <br />  <br /> The three best tracks are &quot;Wake Up Dead, The Conjuring and Peace Sells.&quot; However, actually all the tracks are good. There isn't a bad song on this cd. The 4 bonus tracks are interesting to listen to as well. <br />  <br /> The cd booklet includes a new commentary by Dave Mustaine about &quot;Peace Sells But Who's Buying/&quot; It also features some cool photographs of the band in 1986.  <br />  <br /> Long time and new Megadeth fans will be pleased. I'm glad Dave Mustaine is back to playing in top form. I can't wait until the new Megadeth record &quot;The System Has Failed&quot; comes out on Sept. 14, 2004. I'm also looking forward to seeing them live in the upcoming tour.
0671027387|2.0|Where THE DA VINCI CODE was a light and entertaining puzzle, benefiting from a compelling mix of conspiracy and art history that masked its author's mediocre prose style, Brown's DECEPTION POINT enjoys no such advantage. The fast-pitch pacing of this techno/political thriller does little to make up for the painfully telegraphed--and occasionally ludicrous--plot twists. While the main settings (a state-of-the-art NASA lab on the arctic ice shelf, and an unusual research ship off the Atlantic coast) serve as effective stages for some tense action set pieces, the threats and resolutions are manipulated with such a heavy hand as to seem inevitable. People who've read both of Brown's Robert Langdon books will surely recognize the last-person-you'd-suspect formula for the ultimate evil-doer, but where those revelations, though unlikely, managed to be somewhat acceptable or explicable, the same twists here feel cobbled together, and thus, unearned. The success of THE DA VINCI CODE and, to a lesser extent, ANGELS AND DEMONS earned Brown respect as a smarter Clive Cussler.  DECEPTION POINT, however, feels more like a remaindered Dirk Pitt novel where all thought of language or craft is swept away in a rush of ice bullets and spider-like politicians.  Writing a negative review certainly seems a waste of time, but the botched suspense and sinfully obvious reveals of this novel's mysteries left me just disappointed enough to do so.

B000059HB7|5.0|Howard Hawks typified as any other western fim maker the multiple profiles inmersed in this north american mythology as the western was .<br /><br /> &quot;The war is won only with the available you have , and not with that you would wish to have&quot; , if you translate this statement to this movie , you will notice that it foits accurately .<br /><br /> Since all the allies forces under the sheriff ' s service are not the cream of the cream , that is the only you have for fighting . A clear example about the effective leadership and this film shows us through vignettes and rhapsodic moments .<br /><br /> Since I have been a hard admirer of Howard Hawks is above all his powerful capacity to rtell stories with a prodigious simplicity of resources . He directed a film like a great symphony and that 's his secret .<br /><br /> He was a very introspective man , very quiet but gifted with this clearness about the western meant as life experience . And that premise signed his films , the Howard's conceptual seeds still remain in the mind of so many actual directors . Notice for instance that Hawks was one of the few directors that won in every genre he filmed . since his famous Scarface (one of the film noir pioneers) to The gentlemen prefer blondes . His path seems suggest the enormous interest for developing the inner character and personal philosophies around the subworld reflected in every one of his works .<br /><br /> Timeless western movie!
B0001NBMBC|3.0|Can you say Stone Sours 2nd album? Some songs rock, some are lame. I thought Rick Rubin was going to bring out the best in them but this is worthless. Very boring. Where is the energy from the first album? Some very mature stuff here but acoustic guitars, come on guys...........
B00000JCOV|5.0|anyone who hates this cd, either a) didnt buy the cd and is making assumptions about its crappiness or b) bought it and hated it which means they dont like this style of music. because anyone who likes it likes slipknot, got it? because slipknot is the best band ever. <br />by the end of the opening track, you're dying to hear the rest of the cd, its like building anticipation and when the cd starts, for real, its amazing. if you like metal, rock, w/e, go buy this cd. and while you're at it... but the other two.
B0002EXH5O|3.0|Let me begin by saying everyone should own the original. <br />Now on to the remaster. The sleeve looks great, pics are great. The instruments shine like they never have. There are so many bass lines on that album that I have never heard before. So many little fills that shows how good of a bassist David is. Nicks drumming is great he does a few things that I had never noticed. Now on to the disturbing part. THE ONLY ORIGINAL VOCAL TRACKS ARE HOLY WARS AND HANGER 18. Please people, listen closely to the album and if you know the original album like the back of your hand you will come to this realization. I don't know what had happened in the process of this remaster. But Dave certainly did ruin TNP, 5 magics. The others sound ok for being redone. If you are looking for a better remaster of the old MD. Pick up Peace Sells or So Far....... they sound awesome to say the least.
0425180638|3.0|To get the gist of The Last Precinct, one must read Black Notice -- quite probably, Point of Origin is also required.<br /><br />Whereas Black Notice was a complete and satisfactory novel within itself, even though I had not read Point of Origin, this book falls short of Cornwell's immense talent.  There is sufficient dialogue that the effusive use of descriptions and time lapses are somewhat explainable, the continuous narrative quality, however, turns this into a tell story rather than a show story -- a fatal flaw in manuscripts by new authors.  Those with a reputation get away with it, but the fan club dwindles.  When I finished reading Black Notice, I wondered why I stopped reading Cornwell, now I remember.<br /><br />This does follow through regarding the Chandonne crime family based in France, but the involvement of Interpol, ATF, FBI, CIA, Virginia and New York medical examiners, law enforcement, and District Attorneys, and though I can not recall specifically, maybe the NSA, and it censures the plausibility of the story.  Is ATF Lucy's shoot out in Miami connected?  What does this have to do with crimes in New York, which occurred prior to the Virginia events?  Three men are murdered and disfigured -- why?  Why is the New York DA in charge of a Virginia case?  Who killed the young boy and why?  That does, at least, have an answer.  However, most of the questions do not.<br /><br />Characters that have been apparently way in the background of her earlier novels suddenly appear in this one -- the main one being Marino's son.  Most likely, he was discussed in earlier books, but I do not recall.  He seemed to be a pro bono addition to make the story more interesting and give Marino a bigger part.  If Cornwell had simply completed the novel rather than open it for a sequel, then I never would have missed many of the characters.<br /><br />If you have read Point of Origin and Black Notice, then you will want to read this.  This book was published in 2000, since that time there has been a Kay Scarpetta cookbook.  Kay Scarpetta, for those who do not know, has been the Chief Medical Examiner for the State of Virginia since the series began, and she is an Italian Chef with an unlimited supply of time and food when the mood suits her.  Blow Fly (released in 2003) is the sequel for this story.  I have not read it yet.  I can wait.<br /><br />Sorry, this is just worth three stars for the total frustration of leaving so many questions unanswered, and telling me what is going on, not showing me.<br /><br />Victoria Tarrani00, since that time there has been a Kay Scarpetta cookbook.

0553277472|5.0|I bought this book in my twenties and tried to read it. I felt that the book was significant for me but couldn't grasp the depth of it. Now, in my thirties, I read it again and it landed. It didn't change the way I looked at the world but it totally confirmed my view and put it in words. Pirsig perfectly describes the drive (named 'Quality') that is running our lifes from behind the mind-scene: Quality in search of itself. Understanding this is not a mental thing, not something to be exercised. It just happens to you.
038551123X|4.0|I don't usually like thrillers, but I was pretty thrilled with Dexter. I've never read a book with a narrator quite like him. He's witty, quirky, original, and very lethal.  <br /> <br />I thought the ending was a bit abrupt and left some major threads dangling. There were a couple thin spots in the plot, but overall this was a delicious and devilish concoction. I'm looking forward to the next book.
0780622553|5.0|John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) wakes up in a bathtub, a dead prostitute in the bedroom. What happened? Why can't he remember? Why can't he recall his own name? Did he kill the girl? John has no idea. You see, he was destined for a completely different reality than the one he's awakened to / in. Mr. Murdoch was supposed to be a serial killer. He somehow resisted this fate and must now find out who he really is. Along the way he meets THE STRANGERS, an odd group of humanoids, led by Mr. Hand (Richard &quot;Riff Raff&quot; O'Brien). These scary folks seem bent on Murdoch's destruction. They control everything, making the entire city sleep, so they can rearrange buildings, erect whole new cityscapes, and inject whole new lifetime &quot;memories&quot; / &quot;experiences&quot; into the minds of their subjects (the populace). John soon finds that he can manipulate things with his mind and battle the strangers on an equal footing. Helped by a police detective (William Hurt) and John's &quot;wife&quot; (Jennifer Connelly), Murdoch sets out to discover the secret truth behind the artificial world he's trapped in. Kieffer Sutherland plays a psychiatrist who may or may not be trying to help John Murdoch. The ending is positive without being sappy. DC is sort of a good cross between THE MATRIX, BLADE RUNNER, THE TRUMAN SHOW, METROPOLIS, and THE TRIAL, among others. Would make a mind-blowing double bill w/ MEMENTO! Highly recommended...
B00007KQA3|1.0|This film premiered late in 1984 with a lot of hype about Eurythmics soundtrack. The story goes that when Eurythmics attended the London preview which featured the now DVD version of the soundtrack, they thought it was a joke. Sadly, this was in fact the director's vision of what might otherwise have been a really powerful realization of Orwell's famous novel. After a legal suit, Eurythmics won out and director Michael Radford was forced to honor his own advance publicity and include Eurythmics soundtrack for the public release of the film. Because he had never intended to use the soundtrack at all, the original cut of the film (available on VHS) is hauntingly silent, devoid of music except for the very odd and occassional moment where Eurhtymics soundtrack makes an appearence. This is the film I remembered, a retro-futuristic examination of Orwell's work. Eurythmics' music was powerful and unsettling and really stands on its own as a studio recording (for those who are fans of 80s techno-pop)- keeping in mind that the lp release of the sound track was sooped up for the dance-floor. All in all, Radford's original/DVD vision of this story was hoakey and uninspired. Had he stuck with the material Eurythmics brought to the film, he might have had a real daring film on his hands. As it stands, well...it's hoakey, and uninspired.
B00000GAIW|5.0|Jethro Tull's  1971 concept album, Aqualung, takes on the ambitious theme of man's relationship to God. Begun as a blues band with its original line up in 1968, Tull became musically more experimental, as did so many of the significant groups of the era. Personnel changes accommodated the musical shift towards more pop-classical, folk and rock elements. Despite the new personnel and style, the performances gel around the emerging song craft of Ian Anderson. The quirky spirit of the band seems to reach its definitive apotheosis here. This album, perhaps better than any other at the time, was able to express the popular discontent with traditional religion. The  sequence of songs explore the sufferings of a poor beggar man, the sick, alienated, and homeless Aqualung. As the sad story unfolds, we find him sitting on a park bench, hungry (horny) and lonely; a  picture of destitute misfortune, as the album art shows. The forces of religious charity appear unable to help him;  the religious dogma he's apparently asked to consume does nothing to improve his condition. The scene is set, then, for a scathing social commentary, where the forces of religion seem either powerless or, even worse, contribute to the overall breakdown in Aqualung's world.<br /><br />  Despite the brain numbing caused by the title track's being overplayed on classic rock stations, this concept album holds up well as a significant piece of rock art, a masterpiece. The theme is as relevant today, if not more so, than when it was released over thirty years ago. And the music sounds just as good.
B00005JN2F|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect going into this film, having had seen The Bourne Identity a few years back (and not even knowing until two months ago that it was the first in a trilogy). Overall I have to say I was quite pleased with the film as a whole. The following is a breakdown of all aspects of The Bourne Supremecy. <br />  <br /> Story: (A-) I think the story and plot development was intriguing... giving u twists, turns, and surprises. However, there were some points which were a bit convoluted and a times confusing, but these were minor. Overall the storyline was very enjoyable to follow <br />  <br /> Casting: (A) A really smart casting move was Karl Urban as a Russian assassin; he was the part. A good use of consistancy by keeping all actors from previous movie onboard...a big plus for any film. Refreshing to see new faces and different dynamics. <br />  <br /> Cinematography: (B) I will agree with everybody about the shakiness of the camera in pretty much all dynamic shots; static shots were fine. It's understandable that camcorder shakiness is good when used for certain situations, however it seemed a bit much (I was honestly thinking the film was slipping a little or something). Otherwise, everything seemed alright here. Nothing that really stood out as unconventional or original to make this a perfect A. <br />  <br /> Visual Effects: (A) Not much here except the carchase material and ending credits, which was a really cool effect (and refreshing in that it's nothing like I've ever seen before). Anything which required digital aesthetics held it's own here. <br />  <br /> Music: (B+) Although composed by John Powell, a very good musician, the soundscape was a tad bit bland like his work on The Bourne Identity. I will say I enjoyed his homage to the &quot;Treadstone Assassins&quot; motif from The Bourne Identity...probably his best and most recognized piece of music for the Bourne trilogy. Moby's &quot;Extreme Ways&quot; was a nice touch, especially in lyrical composition in regard to Jason Bourne. <br />  <br /> Overall, a quite decent summer flick, and I think it would be worth seeing again to try and unravel some of the minor confusing points. If you enjoyed The Bourne Identity, you will enjoy The Bourne Supremecy! I recommend!

B000089RV6|4.0|I am 15 years old, and this was the first AC/DC album I ever bought. It still rings true as one of my favorite rock albums of all time (and that's all I listen to, by the way; I'm an anti-rap teen). I soon became an AC/DC fanatic, and I bought Dirty Deeds and the Live at Donington DVD within the next few months. I became more interested in their older material, and so I started listening to their pre Highway to Hell material. I came to the conclusion that although Back in Black is a great AC/DC album to start with, a fan looking for rock with more of a bluesy/'60's rock&roll edge might want to dig a little deeper. My personal recommendation would have to be Let There Be Rock, if you can find it. However, Back in Black will still stand as a testament to one of the greatest rock bands of all time.
B0002J4X1Q|5.0|I can not figure out why for the life of me why this movie was considered bad. It was awesome. The zombies were cool. It had a killer sound track. A WAY above average story for a zombie flik, excellent pacing and cool mutant things.The only thing I disliked this movie was because jill sometimes did karate on the zombies and on one point ran up a wall. But its only a minor flaw. BUY IT TODAY. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000059POY|5.0|I give five stars to this hilarious movie because of two reasons: <br />the beauty of Ewa Aulin and the role of Marlon Brando as the guru, really something rare and another demonstration of the versatility of the greatest American actor.
B000268QB2|4.0|If you've read Rolling Stone lately, or any other popular Western based music periodical, you're certainly conscious of the comparisons (they sound like Coldplay or Travis..... his voice smacks of Freddy Mercury).  All debatable (but none too insulting I must point out - nice company).  Nevertheless, it doesn't much matter, because this debut full length offering is undeniably a rich tapestry of sounds. Its comprised of melodies that sport both catchy, wide eyed hooks, as well as that infamous brand of British melancholy... the kind that's so infectuous, you simply can't resist yielding to the sweet angst of it all.  I loved the purity of the instrumentation, set against those pointed lyrics that hit you dead in the chest.  <BR>    <BR>Its a sea side town in the Fall. Leave it at that.  Keane has arrived.
B00000D9TQ|3.0|There once was a minor rock star who spent years working in the rock and roll quarries touring, making records and living from paycheck to the next uncertain paycheck.  Then his band's charismatic singer goes solo followed by the band's hot guitarist departing as well.  The remaining members decide to make one last go of it-hoping to kindle some magic of their own.  Most of the rock press dismisses any possibilities for the band.  Most of the world's attention is focused on the departed singer as he releases a series of enigmatic records.  Then our rock star's wife tells him he is to quit the music business and get a regular job or she's leaving him.<br /><br />Sadly, our rock star goes on tour and his wife indeed does divorce him.  Depressed and angry, our rock star writes a series of dark songs which surprisingly turn out to be very popular and raises his band to heights it (and few others) had never known before.  Now surrounded with new found riches, our rock star's former wife returns to sue him for a portion of those riches citing her contributions as a \\"creative influence\\".  And she wins.<br /><br />As you have probably guessed by now, our rock star is Phil Collins.  For nearly twenty years Collins was a member of Genesis.  For most of Genesis' history, the band specialized in dark, fantastic songs drenched in progressive musicianship.  Little did we know that the last song on 1978's AND THEN THERE WERE THREE would mark the beginning of Collins own personal new direction.  \\"Follow You, Follow Me\\" was lovely bright and accessible:  just about everything Genesis never was before.  Genesis would continue on its path for years; but Collins chose to develop a solo career of his own.  This began in 1981 with \\"In the Air\\"-a song so menacing and vengeful it sort of out \\"Genesis\\" Genesis.<br /><br />In reality, \\"In The Air\\" was just a diversionary attack.  Collin's solo career really began in earnest with the remake of the very Motown tune \\"You Can't Hurry Love\\".  Soon it was clear Collins was steering himself back into the mainstream with very popish and blue eyed soul songs.  This opened another career in writing and recording songs for movies.  As they say, the rest is history.<br /><br />Most rock opinion makers dismissed this \\"poppy\\" Phil Collins as a lightweight and something of a sellout.  These opinions turned down right vicious as Collin's solo success eventually changed the direction and sound of Genesis itself.<br /><br />In surveying this collection, it is surprising how difficult it was to keep Collins' solo material separate from his Genesis material.  Generally, I tend to enjoy the Genesis material more and so it's absence effects my appreciation of this CD.  I kept looking for \\"That's All\\" and \\"Invisible Touch\\" until after review these were never on Collins' solo records.  Naturally, \\"Home By The Sea\\", \\"In Too Deep\\" nor \\"Land Of Confusion\\" will be found here.  I realize that true fans will liken this to expecting to find a Plymouth Neon at a Honda dealership; but I bring this up to warn other record buyers who don't keep a data base in their head that Collins' solo career may be less than you remember.<br /><br />As it stands, this CD is not in chronological order.  This is to it's benefit as a precisely historically ordered presentation would only confirm the prejudice of others such as myself that Collins lost his progressive rock and rock and roll legitimacy the longer he went.  Attempts for rock stars to be \\"socially conscious\\" such as in \\"Another Day In Paradise\\" only invite contempt.  The joyful \\"Motown\\" songs such as \\"Two Hearts\\" and \\"Something Happened On The Way To Heaven\\" are Collins at his very best.  Romantic material such as \\"One More Night\\" and \\"A Groovy Kind Of Love\\" tend to put many in insulin shock from the high sugar level but they are excellent with modest exposure.  \\"Sussudio\\" was mildly interesting the first time I heard it but it becomes grating with each repeated listening.  Fittingly, thiscollection closes with \\"Take Me Home\\":  a song as attractive and satisfying as \\"Follow You, Follow Me\\" was at the beginning of this journey.<br /><br />Just as changes in the music universe made it impossible for Genesis to return to its progressive stomping grounds, changes since 1990 have banished music of this flavor from the rock charts to the more \\"adult contemporary\\" formats.  In other words, it is miles from being cutting edge.  Still, it is very good for what it is.  We have to at least admit that.  While I'm happy to have this CD, I also know I won't play it much.<br /><br />The other day I was watching the local PBS station as it played a recording of concert.  The audience was filled with these matronly ladies and gray bearded, potbellied dudes swaying side to side and twisting to the music.  On stage was this thin set foursome of middle aged to silver haired men playing what sounded like some very familiar tunes.  I found the whole sight very odd.  Then I was horrified by the realization that this was the Troggs as they ripped into a lukewarm version of \\"Wild Thing\\".  I have tried over the years trying to explain how truly groundbreaking \\"Wild Thing\\" was when it was released in the mid-1960's.  Now here it was on the very vanilla PBS for the love of Pete!!!  I guess it only shows you how radical sounds end up being absorbed into the common sonic vocabulary.  What is new and revolutionary today just becomes old hat in a short time.  It seems to me Phil Collins met this fate much quicker than most.ittingly, this collection closes with \\"Take Me Home\\":  a song as attractive and satisfying as \\"Follow You, Follow Me\\" was at the beginning of this journey. <br /> <br />Just as changes in the music universe made it impossible for Genesis to return to its progressive stomping grounds, changes since 1990 have banished music of this flavor from the rock charts to the more \\"adult contemporary\\" formats.

B000002IZ4|2.0|This is a flavor of the month group. Nothing more nothing less. Half of thier problem was that they were getting too much airplay all at once. It was like the Moby Grape Syndrome of 1967 when Columbia records released a single a day for 5 days after the album was released, and I feel that's what happened here, or possibly STP just has a bigger following down here in Central Florida. When you're gettting bombarded by songs like &quot;Sex Type Thing&quot;, &quot;Plush&quot;, &quot;Creep&quot;, and &quot;Big Empty&quot; 24/7 almost you keep saying &quot;That's Enough&quot;, but then you include &quot;Vasoline&quot; into the mix 2 weeks before the albums released then you have a problem. By the time &quot;Interstate Love Song&quot; was getting airplay in August of 94 I was dissolusioned with radio, and I was in a personal funk as well. The other half is they aren't really original anyhow. The first album proved that as &quot;Dead & Bloated&quot; they rip off Danzig, &quot;Sex Type Thing&quot; they rip off Alice In Chains, &quot;Wicked Garden&quot;, and &quot;Plush&quot; they rip off Pearl Jam. They try to be more themselves here, but the key word is try, but the material is so lame that it's just not worth the effort. They would release 4 more albums after this, but thier effect slowly ebbed away. Now Scott Weiland is playing with Guns and Roses minus Axl, and the rest have just gone away.
B00020X88O|1.0|I sat there watching this thing on some cable channel one night and realised to my self that some of the moral highlights and underlining meaning of this film are truely noble, however the fact that most of this film is nothing but a high budgeted smut film with some pretty terrable acting I can't really stomach it.  I enjoy Verhoeven's other films such as Robocop, Total Recall, Starship Troopers, Basic Instinct and some of his other less known films, but this film was just trash.  Alot of nudity of un-needed nudity and bad scripting of a rather lacking plot made me gag.  As for the moral lession of the film you might as well watch a Kevin Smith film such as Dogma or Clerks to get simular moral messages that are in surprisingly good films.  But if you like stuff that you can just sit back and get lost in the amount of titilation and air humping then you'll probably love this film.  I recomend this to pretty much no one.
B000000WF0|1.0|This is one of the worst albums ever released in Rock and Roll History. &quot;Bittersweet Symphony&quot; kicks off the album nuff said. If maybe one of the other songs kicked the album off it may have had a chance, but since the group chose to kick off the album with this vomit then the whole album is bad. Yes you may argue that it has the classical music which makes it sound cultural, but it's so mind-wrecking so psyche-damaging that it makes me want to suck a lead piece with a trigger at the end. The vocals are at best nasly and whiny too. I was left with the sense of &quot;Why Bother?&quot; The group comes out of Michigan which is notorious for artists like Ted Nugent, Frijid Pink, Brownsville Station, MC5, Iggy and the Stoooges etc. The Verve are the dishonorable boys from the Wolverine State.
B00005JMCT|1.0|I gave this DVD a quick spin (borrowed it, didn't buy it - thank GOD!) only because I'm a big Alyson Hannigan fan, and boy what a puerile MESS this movie is; I ended up fast-forwarding through 85% of the film and even then it was too long.  <br /> Alyson Hannigan is totally WASTED in this film - hardly even used, actually, much to its detriment - although even her considerable talents couldn't save this travesty. No, instead we're left with Jason Biggs and that gaggle of three-name actors who are the most witless, insipid and unpleasant screen performers in a long time. Talk about flop-sweat!! Watching these guys flail away in an effort to enliven the sagging, unfunny and juvenile script is akin to witnessing a really bad car wreck - you know you should avert your eyes, but you're stupefied with morbid interest. The writers obviously followed the hacker's trusty adage: &quot;when in doubt - or simply out of ideas, use the &quot;F&quot; word, and profusely.&quot; Foul language flies like cake sprinkles in this sorry concoction - why anyone would debase themselves by participating in this project is beyond me. And the DVD extras? Who cares? The whole THING blows!! To paraphrase Dorothy Parker, &quot;this is not a movie to be taken lightly, it should be tossed aside with great force.&quot;
B00000099Y|5.0|This is the second full length album by TOOL, and their albums get better as they go along, mainly because all the albums are longer than the last one (with the exception of salival). This album has a perfect mix of dark, haunting music (third eye), along with something pretty funny if you can speak german (die eier von satan). All the songs seem to be either a filler, a VERY well done filler, but a filler none the less, or a extreamly well done song with guitar in which Adam would play with a hammer, epilady, whatever...and all the songs seem to be an intro to the song after it. Finishing off with the 13:45 song, &quot;third eye&quot;, which is one of my favorite songs. TOOL's song structures are almost identical to The Moody Blues'. Each song has an introduction, beginning, middle, end, and resolution. All magnificantly done, on a scale of one to 10 this is a 50.
0380789019|5.0|This book is a feast for the imagination. Truly a step into another world. It is the story of Richard Mayhew, an average Londoner transported into a secret underground London world, that is dark and strange, where anything can happen.<br /><br /> First of all, I must say that I love Richard! He is so sweet, caring, and funny, and I love watching his evolution through out the book. Really, I think this is a story of finding your own strength.<br /><br /> All of the citizens of London Underground are colorful and original, Hunter, Door, Old Bailey. And the Marquis who is my personal favorite, who has &quot;created himself as a grand joke.&quot; Read this book if you want to experience something not like anything you've experienced before, if you think there might be more out there than just the daily routine.<br /><br /> Colorful villains, and some scary situations, but also lots of great subtle humor. Highly recommended.
B000286S8S|2.0|The bottom line: the compilation is OK (a little lacking in the David Lee Roth department) and the new songs are forgettable. My biggest complaint - the end of &quot;Finish What Ya Started&quot; is cut off - no fade out, nothing. Is this a defect in the CD or intended?
6305882592|5.0|The first of perhaps 4 times I saw Harold and Maude was at a theater in Berkeley on University Avenue. I must have been the only person in the audience who had never seen this iconic black-humor film before, because the entire audience applauded for every credit that came on the screen both at the beginning and again at the end. It was obviously a cult film with a rabid cult following, and I wondered what I was getting myself in for. <br />Well. I had no idea what I'd been missing! Harold and Maude (Maude is played by the inimitable Ruth Gordon in one of the best roles of her very long career) is perhaps the blackest of black comedies - and it's a hoot and a half - and then some. It portrays the unlikely but, given the context, perfectly understandable relationship (love affair?) between a death-obsessed teenager, Harold, and an life-celebrating octogenarian widow, Maude. They meet (where else) at a funeral of someone that neither of them knows and they recognize their weird common-ground: funerals. <br />This movie is sweet. It's endearing, touching, beautiful, life-affirming - it's a romance and a passionate plea to reach out and grab life by the lapels, suck it of its essence before it's too late. <br />Marvelous, marvelous - but a warning: you've got to be a certain kind of quirky person in a particularly quirky frame of mind to appreciate it. If you fit the description, this might become one of your favorite movies of all time. <br />
B000058DFO|5.0|It was so sad to hear about Syreeta's passing. &quot;Stevie Wonder Presents Syreeta&quot; was recorded in 1974 and I was 11 years old when I heard my older sister spin this masterpiece. To this day, that album remains my favorite LP of all time. She truly had the voice of an angel. Along with the late great Minne Riperton and Deniece Williams they were &quot;Wonderlove&quot;, Stevie's backup singers. Stevie knows talent!! Now we only have one angel still down here with us. Minne and Syreeta, R.I.P. I love your voices and I miss them dearly.
B0001RVTXO|5.0|Buy this disc, it's an outstanding compilation! I just wish that they have included Levitate Me (the BBC version), I've Been Tired and Head On. I don't care what they say, I find Trompe Le Monde to be an excellent album! Heck, anything that Pixies does is excellent! I am so glad that they are back.
B00003CXCT|3.0|To all those who are giving the purists a hard time--yes, maybe they are a little over-zealous. But no one can ignore the fact that GL has issues. He sincerely believes that the prequels are as good as the original films, and that anyone who says otherwise is just a crazed super-fan. He didn't write the dialogue for the original trilogy, right? Now that we've seen the prequels, we know why--he sucks at writing dialogue. But he doesn't believe anyone that tells him so! The guy has become such a moviemaking legend that he thinks he can do anything and that people will love it no matter what it is--and based on people writing about how they own every one of the twenty versions of the original trilogy that have been released is proof that he's right. I had no idea until reading the reviews that he had changed the ending of Return of the Jedi yet again to insert Hayden Christensen in?! I don't mind some new scenes and all, that's cool--but sticking whineyboy in somewhere he does not belong just to support his self-delusions about the prequels being as good as the original trilogy ever was is sacriledge. Sorry--Hayden was okay for the prequels, but good grief man, get a clue. We didn't need him to make the trilogy good before, and adding him now is pathetic. If your prequels need tie-ins that badly, maybe it's because they were poorly written in the first place? Adding in Hayden is equivalent to the White House taking a big kickback to put a giant Pepsi can in the statue of Liberty's hand. It's in such poor taste as to be not only clearly a pathetic attempt to strengthen the weak prequels by tying them in to something that actually IS good, and so tacky and in such bad taste as to be disgusting. Unfortunately George is so full of himself we can all write whatever we want and he will never bother with any of it--since after all, the only opinion worth listening to is that of the GREAT George Lucas. The rest of us are just commoners, what do we know? This, boys and girls, is called fame going to ones' head. I don't know if I want to buy these or not, anymore. Shame, too-they would have made a nice birthday present. But fear not, purists--I'm willing to put money on the fact that once we've all gone out and bought this version, an 'Original' verison will be released so we can all go out and buy it again. It's not like it would be the first time George and company have used that kind of marketing to make suckers out of all of us. Just wait a few years and then you can pick from the 20 different DVD versions Mr. Lucas will have released by then.
B00000DREB|5.0|there's not a bad song on the album. infectious hospital waste, 44 caliber brain surgery and gellid remains are the highlights. but they are all great tunes. it's pure chaos from start to finish.
B00000K31Q|3.0|I liked the film because it was a hip take on Shakespere's The Taming of the Shrew. It was creative in that spin, yet it was to slapstick to take on a deeper intent. I enjoyed that Heath Ledger really showed a comic and fun character to us. I haven't seen him like that in his more recent movies. Julia Stiles is good as a bitchy teen, taking on the shrew role quite well. I also really liked the counselor, Ms. Perky. She just did was really funny acting like the romantic writer slash autoritarian. It was a pretty much a basic formula for teen films, excepting the 2 leads. One of the actors I have seen before in a movie, he played the other guy dating Stiles popular sister. The movie was pretty much boy meets girl, falls for girl, girl takes a while being a shrew than falls for boy. The other side story is the sister who is completely opposite, bordering on shallow while her sister is deep. She also has the similiar thing going, boy meets girl, girl takes a while to warm up, than girl falls for boy. Oh well, it was a fun film and not a waste of time. <br /> <br />Lisa Nary
B000002IO8|3.0|This is a fine album, with good to very good live versions of some classic MJQ tunes. However, the quartet's &quot;last concert&quot; was not really their best. At times, the music on these discs is a bit too staid and careful, and one gets the feeling that the decision to disband (temporarily, as it turned out) was motivated at least in part by a slight loss of enthusiasm for a project in which these musicians had been engaged, by 1974, for over two decades. This impression is reinforced by the inclusion, in this CD reissue, of some of the weaker material that was wisely omitted from the original 2-LP set. <br />  <br /> The excitement the MJQ at its best generated in live performance is much better captured by the excellent &quot;Dedicated to Connie&quot; (ASIN B000002J4T) and &quot;European Concert&quot; (ASIN B000058TGY, but currently out of print). Both were recorded in Europe in 1960, when the group was at the height of its ability but still had something to prove, and both feature taut, committed performances of an intensity that &quot;The Last Concert&quot; doesn't quite match.
6304082428|4.0|The first time I watched this VHS version of Pride and Prejudice, I very much enjoyed it. Every time I watch it I pick up some nuance I hadn't seen before. My favorite scene is the dance where Darcy and Lizzy match wits as well as steps. Make no mistake: this is a fairly complex dance that would have most non-professional dancers counting under their breaths today. Yet Darcy's and Lizzy's verbal fencing cause the dance to seem effortless. I challenge viewers to match similar wit and grace today. That Ehle and Firth can achieve this as Lizzy and Darcy speaks volumes of their own abilities. <br /> <br />Yes, it's not a perfect adaptation of the novel, but it's a great holiday from today's concerns for five hours. <br /> <br />I've been wanting to get the DVD version of P&P, but if it's going to be just as washed out as my VHS version or worse, I might wait until they re-release the regular edition. I wish A&E had not compromised on quality and called it a 'special edition.' Cost versus quality -- you'll have to decide what works for you. 4 stars only because of poor PAL to NTSC transfer and not due to quality of acting or content.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|now,mind you....if anyone besides me can remember a time earlier this year when Slipknot said that this album was going to be a SLIPKNOT album....you'd agree that this is just &quot;StoneSour #2&quot; <br />  <br /> that being said...the only good tracks on here are,&quot;&quot;Before I Forget&quot; & &quot;Welcome&quot;.The rest of this of this album just drones on,and seems to go in a systematical cycle.Corey sings,Corey Talks,Corey Screams.One pleasent surprise is that there IS guitar solos...and I'm proud of them for making that step.But however that still does not balance things.Songs like &quot;3 Nil&quot;,&quot;Ver Million&quot;,and &quot;Prelude 3.0&quot; are total peices of crap,while songs like &quot;Pulse of the Maggots&quot;,&quot;Danger:Keep Away!&quot;,and &quot;Ver Million PT.2&quot; sound like they were written in 10 minutes,while the band members were stoned (-no pun intended-) sour.So don't waste your $17.00 bucks on this drivel,there are more bands worthy of praise for their offerings this year,like Fear Factory,Demon Hunter,and Killswitch Engage. <br />  <br /> If you do buy it,you'll want to burn it & bury it within 15 minutes.
B0002EXH5O|2.0|Dave mustaine stole the soul of this album when he resang so many of the songs. The album was perfect to begin with it didn't need to be touched. When he resang five magicks he ruined a great song. When the deeper voice comes in it sounds like a happy retard. Buy the orginal print used and you will see that the album was perfect to begin with.
B0001Z53CY|5.0|Everytime I listen to this album, it sounds better and better! At first, I was not all into it. Now, after listening to it, on several occasions, I have really adapted to it. <br /> <br />The five best songs on the album are: <br /> <br />How Come <br />Keep Talkin <br />40 oz. <br />D-12 World <br />Just Like U <br />(This List Is In No Particular Order!!!) <br /> <br />I encourage everyone to go out and buy this album, pronto!!! Also, if you do not have the group's first album, Devil's Night, you should acquire it to!
B000000OF6|5.0|So many classic songs on here like  Another one Bites the dust, We are the champions, we will rock you, Under Pressure, Bhioman Rhapsody, etc.  Awesome.
B0001CNRS4|1.0|This DVD is truely dissapointing. The plot line takes a huge chip off &quot;Save the Last Dance,&quot; only difference between that movie and &quot;Honey&quot; is that the &quot;Save the last dance&quot; had a better plot line and talented actors, while &quot;Honey&quot; stars Jessica Alba, who was obvisouly casted for her sub-par looks and her worse then your high school cheesy production of romeo and juliet acting talents. The movie has as much pizazz as &quot;Glitter.&quot; The plot line of the road to fame was not as easy as i thought it could be is getting really old. please don't waste your money on this junk.
0553260111|5.0|This book is so in depth that its crazy to think it was writtin in th 70's.  A must Read

B000067CQK|5.0|David Bowie's classic album with such great songs as Ziggy Stardust, Sufragette city, Star, etc.  But not only is there the awesome 11 song classic... theres a 12 song second disk.  It has great new mix's, alt. version's, demo's, and great regular songs like John, I'm only Dancing , The Superman, etc.  So let me end in 3 words. <br />BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br />
6305696071|4.0|One of my favorite romantic comedies of all-time (probably the movie I've seen the most no. of times...shhhh! Don't tell...) Roberts and Gere have great on-screen chemistry. It's a true modern Cinderella story. Definetly my fav Garry Marshall film. BOTTOM LINE: A total feel good flick, great for a night in with the girls. A must-see for the classic piano scene (send the kids to bed). Grade: B+
B000286S8S|4.0|but unfortinatley the new material is weak but the old material is still as freash as when it was realeased.  And any song on here is great minus the 3 new ones.
B00005R1N3|5.0|This is one of the scariest movies ever made. I can still remember seeing this in college with some of my dorm buddies and we were all scared. On television this was called Stranger in the House. You have to remember this came out years before Halloween and When a Stranger Calls. You probably would had to have seen this before all the other horror movies that came after it (and stole from it) to truly appreciate the greatness of this movie.
B000001Y42|5.0|When I read some of the more recent reviews, almost all everyone said was it was bad. But when I bought it(used, of course) I was impressed! Here's a rundown of the songs:<br /><br /> 1. Intro-(N/A)-There intros, nothing special<br /><br /> 2. Pollution-(9/10)-Opening track starts with a cool intro then BAM! It gets into a heavy song! The end of the song is funny.<br /><br /> 3. Counterfeit-(10/10)-Reminds me of 'Fake' by KoRn cuz both songs are about people who are 'fake'.<br /><br /> 4. Stuck-(9/10)-Good song<br /><br /> 5. Nobody Love's Me-(10/10)-Starts with fred saying 'Shut up' in the background and gets very heavy, until the big finish, which is just okay.<br /><br /> 6. Sour-(9/10)-Pretty good song.<br /><br /> 7. Stalemate-(8/10)-Good song but it's not the best, but definetly not the worst.<br /><br /> 8. Clunk-(9/10)-Love the heavy bass intro.<br /><br /> 9. Faith (George Michael cover)-(10/10)-My favorite song here. A George Michael cover but LB added heavy guitar parts and screaming during the chorus, turntables, and a new line: 'Get the [f-bomb] up!' Advice: Skip the song when it gets to 2:25 so you won't here that bad bonus track.<br /><br /> 10. Stink Finger-(9/10)-Sorta reminds me of 90 Teen 90 Nine from Significant Other. That's all I can say.<br /><br /> 11. Indigo Flow-(10/10)-The &quot;Show Me What You Got&quot; of the album. If you own Significant Other you'll know what i'm talking about.<br /><br /> 12. Leech-(10/10)-The heaviest song on the album!!!! The only problem is that it's too short, but why let one problem bring down the rating?<br /><br /> 13. Everything-(8/10)-At 16:40 it's the longest song on the album. It has some cool effects in it.<br /><br /> Bottom line: It's actually a very good album. Buy this and Significant Other for LB's best albums.<br /><br /> I'm done here.

B000001ESP|4.0|I recall a quote mentioning that 'Moving Pictures is Rush's Who's Next', the quintessential recording that defined a bands career, the pinnacle, the high watermark, the best. Rush never made a weak album, but 'Moving Pictures' represented a band clicking on all cylinders, at the peak of their musical prowess, the perfect vehicle to showcase a band who excelled at each of their instruments. The bands fanbase and critics always knew how gifted/technically adept the trio were...now the masses were about to discover the samething. Aggressive power-riffs, furiously fluid basslines, stampeding drum barrages, cameos by mystical-synths, all binded together by Geddy Lee's unmistakable high-pitched wail. A powerful album of exceptional musicianship, from the urgency of 'Tom Sawyer' and rolling thunder of 'Red Barchetta', to the fiery instrumental 'YYZ' and the sheer brashness of 'Limelight'. Not to be excluded is the synth/guitar epic 'The Camera Eye', a 10 minute joyride displaying the bands musical virtuosity in true Rush fashion. There's no denying that Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson and Neil Peart are bonafide musicians in every sense, constantly name-dropped, their influence is legendary amongst musical peers. There's also no denying that 'Moving Pictures' demonstrates Rush at the peak of their creative powers. But words are cheap. Listen to the CD itself and allow the music to convince you, allow your ears to pass judgement on one of the greatest classic-rock albums of alltime.
0783225857|5.0|The film To Kill A Mockingbird is likely a live history document to me. There is a lot of interesting differences between the present America and the one in years of 1930's that I have found after watching this movies. This movie drives you backward to the nation of American a couple years before the World War II where racial discrimination and all other prejudices were existing and deeply impacted every single aspect of the life of American people especially African American. You will know how American children grow up at that time, how they develop their point of view, how they see, look and accept the reality.  The film also teaches you what is the courage, how to be courageous and in what situation we need to be courageous. For me the biggest theme that I have learn from this movie is that no matter who you are, where you're from, what you do, if anything wrong just happen to you,  just accept and face it as if it is a step you need to go through in you life. You must use all your courage to overcome any obstacle that might stop you on your way. There might not be an exit at the end of the road but if because of that you don't go forward, it means you are going nowhere.
B0000AM6K2|4.0|As you have read all over this webpage, the album is excellent.  The style of music and the vibe it gives is very mellow and chilled.  It is true to say that this album is unique for its time period.  Not many people, if any, have released music of this nature in the new mellenium.  If there are, I have yet to hear.  The only reason I give this album 4 stars, is due to the lyrics.  I find the lyrics didn't have much thought put into them.  Almost rushed.  Finally, I'd reccommend this album to anyone who likes chilled, relaxing music with superb instrumental and melodic qualities.
B00005QY5Y|5.0|Buried in the irony of underacted and emotionally-charged songs of this wonderful album is a musical gem by an extremely gifted singer/songwriter. <br />  <br /> &quot;La Cienega Just Smiled&quot; is a haunting accoustical peice that steals your heart on the first heavy strum and pulls you deeper in the composed yet distraught poetic rambling of a man loving in isolation.  <br />  <br /> The whole song, while oozing of sadness and despair, ironically doesn't recount the details of a sad story. In fact, it is only the pervading sad strumming that reminds the listener of the actual heaviness of his feelings, as Ryan Adams mumbles through his introspection in casual tonality. <br />  <br /> All components of the song (lyrics, arrangement and vocal stylings) conjure to elicit a sincere, melancholic mood that has more enigmatic qualities than a Clapton composition, without the tearful indulgence of a Lilith Fair sap.  <br />  <br /> Ryan Adams deserves a place among such stellar talents as Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, Bruce Springsteen, Peter Gabriel and Rufus Wainwright! <br />  <br /> (Now if only someone can tell me what &quot;La Cienega&quot; really pertained to...)
0679731725|5.0|\\"The remains of the day\\" is one of famous literature books in England, and the book was got England's highest literary honor in 1989. Especially, this is an England's literary work though its author is Japanese, Kazuo Ishiguro. The story tells about a Steven's life who is a butler in Darlington Hall. Steven was very successful in his job, but he bitterly failed in love. Why? Because he only focused on work even to complete his work, he did not care about himself. If Steven early realizes that love plays an important role in our lives and our lives will be meaningless without love, his life will be able to positively change a lot and he will not be alone in the rest of his life. In addition, the professionalism that Steven always follows does not allow him to have any romantic or sexual pleasure. Stevens is too late when he finally realizes he fell in love with Miss Kenton, the former housekeeper in Darlington Hall, but she has gone away to make her own life. That is an expensive price Steven has to pay to get success in work. What a pity for Steven's fate!
1592400876|4.0|This little book about punctuation has gotta be one of the most unlikely non-fiction bestsellers in recent memory.<br /><br />For most of John Q. Public, a PURE 'reference' book about punctuation will cure insomnia better than a double-dose of sleeping pills.<br /><br />But 'Eats, Shoots and Leaves' is different.  It's in the 'reference' AND 'humor' sections at most libraries and booksellers like Amazon.com.<br /><br />Author Lynne Truss - a novelist, radio personality and a former television AND sports critic for the Times of London (geez, what a resume) - obviously isn't the first to say that punctuation MATTERS.<br /><br />But she's the first to scream her case globally, armed with a comical and politically incorrect poisonous pen.  In truth, Truss doesn't take herself too seriously, but she gets to choose what's good and bad, which offenses are egregious and which aren't worth bursting a vein.  Her 'zero tolerance' mantra is actually a selective ruse.  Bad signage in particular gets a big-time skewering.<br /><br />Where Truss succeeds best, though, is going for the jugular to push her point, using hyperbole that's laugh-out-loud funny.  Examples:<br /><br />* If you persist in writing, 'Good food at it's best,' (instead of the correct possessive, 'its'), 'you deserve to be struck by lightning, hacked up on the spot and buried in an unmarked grave.'<br /><br />* Punctuation vigilantes who spot offenses must be armed with tools, such as:  correction fluid, big marking pens, a bucket of paint, a big brush - and - a gun.<br /><br />There are patches in 'Eats, Shoots and Leaves' where you want to shake Truss silly for pounding you with one history lesson after another.  Some of it quite dull.  Her stories about the origins of punctuation marks - the changing acceptance of apostrophes, periods, commas, colons, semicolons, dashes, hyphens, parentheses, brackets, question marks and periods - aren't as effective as hard examples about their proper use today.  Although I did laugh at her rueful comment about how upset she is for not volunteering to meet a centuries-old punctuation advocate to have his babies (Aldus Manutius the 'Elder, 1450-1515).  As if she had a choice.<br /><br />'Eats, Shoots and Leaves' is a reference (each punctuation mark has its own chapter), but you can easily thumb (or skip) through some of her prose to get to the meatiest examples.  Truss is best when she demonstrates how two sentences, for example, identical in every way EXCEPT for their punctuation marks, can have opposite meanings:<br /><br />A woman, without her man, is nothing.<br /><br />A woman:  without her, man is nothing.<br /><br />Meanwhile, it's a little disrupting to see what's OK in the U.K. that's NOT OK in America (putting a period outside a quotation mark at the end of a sentence, for example, instead of inside it).  But these differences are noted and Truss doesn't force British usage down your throat.<br /><br />Finally, to critics who say the 'better book' about punctuation is 'Elements of Style' by William Strunk and E. B. White:  Well yeah, of course.  But have you ever tried reading 'Elements of Style' from cover-to-cover?  It's pure reference, not entertainment.  'Eats, Shoots and Leaves' is irreverent, but not irrelevant.  And Lynne Truss, to her credit, pays proper homage to both pioneers.  She even revisits a 1999 Washington Post parody by columnist Bob Hirschfield about the 'Strunkenwhite Virus,' which rejected e-mails with improper punctuation, bringing commerce and productivity to a screeching halt.<br /><br />It's no crime taking on an otherwise dull subject and loading it up with laughs.  Truss obviously wants to reach more than just educators, librarians, writers and readers.<br /><br />With 'Eats, Shoots and Leaves,' she's done it.  So put 'em both on your shelf.per use today.

0780629450|5.0|Kenneth Branagh's &quot;Hamlet&quot; is a sumptuous adaptation of Shakespeare's play. His version takes place in the nineteenth century, and while this may seem a radical and unnecessary departure from the original, it works out beautifully. Branagh retains Shakespeare's exact language--word for word--and although I thought it would be hard to understand, the subtle, superb acting and rich scenery made it completely comprehensible. There's a stellar cast--Kenneth Branagh as Hamlet, Kate Winslet as Ophelia, Glenn Close as Gertrude, Derek Jacobi as Claudius, and many more well-known faces. The cinematography is beautiful.       I found this version far more poignant and touching than Mel Gibson's version or even the Laurence Olivier one. There are so many excellent scenes--the one in which Hamlet vies with Laertes over whose love is greater for Ophelia, over her gravesite no less, stands out, as does Hamlet's &quot;To be or not to be&quot; sololiquy in that hall of mirrors. Ophelia also goes crazy in that hall and sings her flower song, another outstanding scene. Finally, Hamlet's recollection of &quot;poor Yorick&quot; lends a depth and poignancy to this scene that I never felt when reading the play.      The film clocks in at a little over four hours I believe, but it's worth it. I also recommend the soundtrack, by Patrick Doyle--it's moving and well done.      When will this be out on DVD?

Whoever says that this is no good DOES NOT KNOW WHAT HE IS SAYING! There are songs here that are otherwise not available in live versions, and the presence of such guests as Charlie Daniels, Toy Caldwell, and Steve Morse creates a unique \\"family\\" feeling. The instrumental \\"Free Bird\\" offers proof of how hard it really was to fill Ronnie's shoes, but Johnny's vocals on the other songs prove that it could be done. You should get this album if you can find it.
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay first caught my attention with &quot;Yellow,&quot; a melodious, catchy tune from their freshman album. And although &quot;Parchutes&quot; is a great album within itself, &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; is simply stunning. There are few cd's that I listen to over and over again, but this is one of them. And there are no songs on the cd that I intentionally skip, because all of them are truly good. &quot;In My Place&quot; is a wonderful ballad, a song infused with yearning and desire, and probably my favorite on the cd. &quot;The Scientist&quot; is as full of heart as is &quot;In My Place,&quot; and &quot;Clocks&quot; is also a winner. There's something playful about &quot;God Put A Smile Upon Your Face,&quot; and it's fun to rock along to in your car. This is a beautiful cd and deserves all the gushing praise it has garnered. It's hard for me to imagine anyone being disappointed with it; it just sounds too good!

B00008NRLX|5.0|The Jayhawks' &quot;Rainy Day Music&quot; was recommended to me by a friend, and I was skeptical. I'm no fan of country music and I was told this was &quot;alternative country.&quot; But I listened, and I liked! With the exception of a couple of songs near the end of the album, &quot;Rainy Day Music&quot; is exceptionally pleasing to listen to. &quot;All the Right Reasons&quot; is a quiet, shimmering song with a lot of emotional resonance. &quot;Save it for a Rainy Day&quot; is vibrant and engaging, and &quot;You Look So Young&quot; is a beautiful song about innocence and experience. &quot;Angelyne&quot; has a lot of beat and gusto to it. All in all this is a great album--go out and buy it for a rainy day!
0684833395|4.0|Captain Yossarian has a problem.  He wants to live, but thousands of people he has never met are trying to kill him!  Every mission he flies as bombadier for the Army Air Forces could get him killed, and he wants to get out of the war.  Unfortunately, the only way he can get out is if he's crazy, and wanting to get out is proof that he's sane.<br /><br />This is a biting, cynical indictment of beauracracy and the narrow-minded paper-pushers who make it so disfunctional.  From the squadron commander, Major Major, who was promoted based solely on his name, to Colonel Cathcart, who keeps raising the number of missions needed before the crews can go home and volunteering his crews for the most dangerous missions, to General Peckem, who wants to add the bomb groups to his special services command, this book is full of over-the-top characters that are just barely within the realm of believability.  This book is funny and infuriating, at the same time, and reflects the worst traits of any beauracracy.
6303014100|4.0|'Pro-Confederate bias is pretty standard revisionism'? I question the reviewer who wrote that critique. So often in today's world of \\"dumbed down\\" history the opposite is true - slavery is often the only reason given for why the civil war was fought. This is a disservice both to history and to our educational system.<br /><br /> Thankfully, \\"Gettysburg\\" is at least fair enough to look at both sides and not blithely jump on the politically correct bandwagon. Yes, Lincoln wanted to free the slaves and many in the Union fought for that reason, but many did not, just as many in the South were not fighting specifically to defend it. As a southern prisoner of war in the movie states, \\"I don't care much about the 'darkies' one way or the other....I'm fightin for my 'rats'\\".<br /><br /> The movie itself is gripping and rarely boring. My one criticism are the occasional preachy scenes (such as Chamberlain and Kilrain discussing the black race), but there aren't that many and it's almost to be expected in today's cinema.<br /><br /> Sheen is excellent as Lee and Berenger decent as Longstreet (could they have redone his beard, perhaps?)....but as others have said, Jeff Daniels steals the show as Chamberlain. But perhaps the most powerful single scene in the movie is performed by Richard Jordan as Armistead, when speaking to Longstreet about his very close friend Winfield Hancock who is now commanding part of the Union army just a couple miles away. His reluctance to fight someone as close as a brother to him is certainly a theme often discussed regarding the civil war (brother vs. brother, friend vs. friend) and Jordan does a perfect job bringing this unfortunate paradox to life.<br /><br /> Cinematography and score are first rate. You really don't want the movie to end. Something the whole family can watch and enjoy.....you might even learn something too.
B000059LGC|5.0|To my mind, Peter Ustinov is Hercule Poirot. He may not bear much resemblence to the character famed mystery writer Agatha Christie described him in the many novels in which he appeared, but Ustinov made the role his own in a series of movies in the late 1970s through to the late 1980s - of which DEATH ON THE NILE is the first.<br /><br /> Brought to the screen by the same team who entertained four years earlier with the MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS production that headlined Albert Finney as Belgium's most famous literary detective among a high calibver all-star cast, the 1978 production of &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; also presented an impressive group of veteran actors (such as David Niven) to ypung and upcoming stars such as actress Lois Chiles (who would go on a year later to appear in the blockbuster MOONRAKER).<br /><br /> Chiles plays the victim in this riddle of a mystery, a spoilt heiress who seems to have the misfortune of having taken a cruise with a boatload of people the majority of whom all have a reason to kill her. It's up to Poirot to navigate his way through all the red herrings and clues and come up with a conclusion that is just as shocking and ingenious as any that has ever been brought to the screen.<br /><br /> This is my favorite of all the Christie adaptations, the entire cast is uniformly excellent, the direction solid and the locations awe inspiring.<br /><br /> Also of note is the inclusion of a MAKING OF... vintage featurette made to coincide with the movle's release as well as an interview with Ustinov.<br /><br /> All in all, well worth a look by mystery fans and a definite purchase by Christie devotees.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Muse are one of the most exciting British bands to grace our land (yes, im English) in the past decade. They do everything that no other band can do. They are unique, special, hypnotizing and inspiring.  <br />I don't understand the comparision to Radiohead, and although i love Radiohead i think Muse do that little bit extra and go that extra mile.  <br />i like Radiohead because they are weird, but they are also getting boring. I like Muse for the same reason, they are weird - but they are certain not boring.  <br />I can't think of any other band that had done a space opera rock theme for it to actually work. Muse have. <br />Muse make me proud to be British and show that we can actually produce brillant masterpiece's that not only are successful in the strange world of European music,  but also in the farer parts of the world like America, Japan and Australia. <br />Bring on album number 4!
B0000C8AVI|5.0|All controversy about Dylan's faith aside....<br /><br />This album is considered to be the best of Bob's gospel albums (with Saved and Shot of Love). The songs here are more varied in style than Saved, and the Christian message is more subtle. It is more of a rock album with Christian lyrics, rather than a Christian rock album. This does not make it any better or worse than Saved or Shot of Love.<br /><br />From the medium grind of Gotta Serve Somebody to the reggae of Man Gave Names To All the Animals to the simple beauty of I Believe In You, Bob runs a gamut of styles and it all works. The back-up musicians mostly stay out of the way, which sometimes works for Bob and sometimes it doesn't. Here it does. These are beautifully written songs by a man who had found a new passion in his soul.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|I am not sure if I heard the music or saw one of the videos first, but anyway whatever the order, they ended up blending together into something that for me was intriguing and beautiful at the same time, like any contemporary art should feel. <br /> <br />I have to admit, although, that without the first three or four videos suggesting that there was a story behind the music and the anime I wouldn't have probably even noted this DVD, but I would have also probably bought the CD anyway, that powerfully echoing  this music is. After seeing the DVD I can only say buy it. You like Daft Punk and anime? you must buy it. You like Daft Punk? buy it because with the added animation it feels like a mature and round work. You just happen to like anime? well there are other DVDs that you should probably dig first (starting with AKIRA), but this one has no reason to envy them at all, and maybe you will end up liking Daft Punk music too. <br /> <br />The style of the anime is a real pleasure, reminding me of all the japanese cartoons of my childhood (I didn't know they were called anime at that time), that's a plus.
0684857219|5.0|People who go to the gym have many goals.  Some want to bulk up, some want to slim down.  Some just want to get in better shape or get stronger.  No matter what your goals are, this book can help.  Arnold was a 7 time Mr Olympia winner, and a 3 time Mr Universe winner.  He DOMINATED the sport of bodybuilding.  So who would be better to teach you about it?  The book is geared toward a bodybuilder trying to compete, but no matter what your skill or what you want the final result to be, the book can help you.  He explains not only what techniques worked for him, but also what techniques work for other people. so you can hear it all, and try it all, and take what works for you.  He also does more then just discuss lifting weights- he talks about nutrition/diet, injury prevention and recovery, plus competition related information like posing and appearance.  It is a great book, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to change the way they look.

0803723865|4.0|After taking Britain by storm and becoming one of the most popular picture books to hit it big in merry old England, America finally got a chance to read &quot;The Gruffalo&quot; in 1999. And, to be honest, it didn't make that big of a splash. It's a nice story, no question. There's a good basic plot and amusing illustrations by the talented Axel Scheffler. It's just a nice book, no more, no less. If you're looking for a picture book fable that adapts old variations of ancient folktales, methinks &quot;The Gruffalo&quot; might be exactly what you're looking for.<br /><br /> One day a carefree little mouse takes a jaunty stroll through the big woods. While doing so he comes across a sly fox that wishes to invite the mouse to lunch (wink wink). The mouse is no fool and makes his apologies, saying that he wishes he could but he's already meeting a gruffalo. The fox is unfamiliar with what a gruffalo exactly is, so the mousie comes up with an extravagant and horrific monster. This description is so effective that the fox speeds away. Next, the mouse meets a hungry owl and the same scene occurs only with slightly new gruffalo descriptors. After the owl makes his excuses and flees the mouse meets a snake and the whole process begins again. Once the snake slithers out of slight the mouse (who up to this point had no idea that gruffalos actually existed) comes across an honest-to-goodness gruffalo. The gruffalo is delighted to see the mouse (quote unquote, &quot;My favorite food!&quot;) and the small rodent must come up with a way to escape this new hitherto unthought of danger.<br /><br /> The story reminded me of the old fable about the boy and the giant. You've probably heard it at one point or another. In the story the boy convinces the giant (though delicate trickery) that he, not the giant, is the strongest creature on earth. This story is very similar to that idea, with the mouse convincing the gruffalo that he is the reason the fox, owl, and snake run away when the two of them approach. The text is definitely bouncy and fun and the whole book is written in rhyme. There's not a single line of text in this puppy that doesn't scan either, so the book's a fabulous read-aloud. It's great reading the smug mouse's, &quot;Silly old Fox! Does he know? There's no such thing as a gruffalo!&quot; Author Julia Donaldson (who also wrote the fabulous you-must-check-it-out &quot;Spiffiest Giant in Town&quot;) mentions in her author bio that originally she envisioned this story with a tiger. But it's hard to come up with many rhymes for tiger (Geiger?) so she changed her mind and invented the gruffalo instead. It's a far superior choice. Rounding out the story are Mr. Scheffler's great great illustrations. The small mouse protagonist never looks particularly scared by the dangerous situations he finds himself in. I also have a soft spot in my heart for any picture book character that regularly stands about with his arms crossed behind his back oh-so-casually. But that's just me.<br /><br /> A fine bit of storytelling with lovely illustrations and an enjoyable plot. I doubt very much you'll ever find anyone who dislikes &quot;The Gruffalo&quot;. I'm not saying it's impossible, but it's definitely unlikely. If you'd like a fun story to read aloud to one, two, or twenty youngsters, this might be an excellent choice.

B00006RAKP|5.0|I've been an Elton fan since the early days of his career. While (as other reviewers have noted) there are a few holes in this compilation, it's an excellent overview of Sir Elton's entire musical career (and has proven to be a good substitute for my collection of Elton vinyl LPs). When first released in the US this set came with a \\"bonus\\" CD (which adds 4 tracks, including live recordings of \\"Candle In The Wind\\" and \\"Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me\\"), but the current Amazon offering doesn't appear to include the third disk.     What's missing? \\"Funeral for a Friend / Love Lies Bleeding\\" is one of his best musical pieces -- but you really should have the \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\" album in your collection anyway. I'd also have added \\"Pinball Wizard\\" which is found on the soundtrack from the musical \\"Tommy\\".     If you're only going to own one Elton CD, this is it.

B00001U0DP|5.0|The first time I watched this film was in the last week or so of Spanish class. When he'd first mentioned it, I'd shrugged it off and thought, &quot;Oh boy, not another one of those preachy movies..&quot; <br />  <br /> The first 30 minutes we spent watching the movie, I didn't pay much attention because I'd thought it wouldn't be worth it. Boy, was I wrong. <br />  <br /> This movie blows you away. It's a comedy, it's a tragedy, but it's also a hopeful movie. <br />  <br /> The movie begins with no real hint of what's to come - it starts with Guido trying to win the attention of his &quot;Principessa&quot; using his endless imagination and terrific sense of humor. He loses neither when the Holocaust begins - in fact, he makes good use of both in order to make sure that his son would be shielded from the horrible reality. <br />  <br /> This movie had me laughing and crying, sometimes at the same time. When it ended, I wanted to watch it all over again, from the beginning. It's definitely a film worth watching - and remembering - and even re-watching. <br />  <br /> Watch, be blown away.. and be sure to have some tissues nearby, just in case :)
0684833395|3.0|I do not like \\"Catch 22\\" book. The expression of this book is so difficult to understand. It was very long and too many characters. I was very bored when I reading this book. Also it is not my favorite type of book.  <br />However, sometimes the language of book is very funny. I like the scene, where Yossarian- a bombardier (main character) had the conversation with Luciana (Italian woman). Yossarian asked her to marry him, but they talked as if they are all crazy. That kind of conversation made me laugh the whole way of reading the \\"Catch 22.\\" Also the conversation between Yosaarian and Doc were very crazy too, it seemed as if they were out of mind. So sometimes I need to concentrate about what they tended to say to understand the conversation. <br />\\"Catch 22\\" is about Yossarian who do not like the war. Yossarian always thinks that someone is trying to kill him. He thinks that the war is stupid and people are dead for nothing. <br />I agree with him, I hate the war too. People die in the war.

0553382179|5.0|Dear fellow disorganized, unhappily hermited soulmates,<br /><br /> You don't need to buy this book if you have access to the Internet (and how else would you be reading this review?). Everything you need to know can come to you in daily emails if you register at the Flylady website (.net).<br /><br /> Hard to believe, but the website and email services are completely FREE. This is a labor of love from our dear Flylady, Marla Cilley, who wants everyone to have the peace she has, with a house people can visit, time for the kids and relatives, healthy meals. It happens when you take her advice, stop beating yourself up, and take the baby steps in the order she describes (first, clean out your kitchen sink and shine it; don't worry, she tells you exactly HOW to do it too). Another magic trick is to get up in the morning and get dressed, all the way to makeup, hair, and shoes, so you can answer the door if needed, and watch your self-image magically transform!<br /><br /> But after you've been on the website or getting the daily email bulletins for a while, you're going to want to have this book by your bedside as well, telling you what a GOOD job you're doing just by STARTING (for a change!). THIS BOOK IS NOT GOING TO MAKE YOU FEEL GUILTY. Neither is the website.<br /><br /> Marla is more religious than I am (WAY more religious; I'm a Unitarian Universalist!), but it doesn't get in the way for me because she is so motivated by love and isn't preaching any specific religion.<br /><br /> Let me end with a quote from the book, 'If we do nothing else, I hope we impress upon you that if you don't take care of yourself, you will have nothing left to nurture your family. You will be filling their cups with an empty pitcher. Everyone will be left unfilfilled. You have found this book because you were searching for something, anything, to help you get your home in order.'<br /><br /> Do yourself a favor, honey, and treat yourself to a copy of this revolutionary book.<br /><br /> Your friend,<br /><br /> Harrietnary book. <br />  <br /> Your friend, <br /> Harriet <br />
B0001ZX0PG|1.0|There are some movies that draw attention from awards shows... there are some that draw fan attention.  Usually I can understand one way or another and accept the differentiation and enjoy either type for what they are.  But then a movie like Mystic River comes along and makes me wonder if my whole world is off.  Yes yes this movie is by Eastwood... maybe that explains the interest.  But nothing should forgive such overacting that only Mr. Penn can conjure up.  And nothing should forgive plot holes that would annoy a seven year old.  Sometimes Hollywood manages to trick people into watching a crapfest...  Well folks, this is one of those times.  I honestly say that this movie has NO redeeming qualities.

And I watch the DVD like several times a day! <br /> It`s one of my favorite movies now! <br /> You can really relate to the movie character`s relationship of Javier Suarez and Katey Miller and you just admire them, they`re so loveable!!! <br /> I wish I could be Katey Miller and love, kiss and dance with Javi. He`s totally cute and sexy. I`m a big fan of Diego Luna now! But Romola is also a great actress! <br />

0316666343|5.0|It is with no little irony that THE LOVELY BONES should be published now. The decision that resulted in this incredible book being released midway through 2002 was made months before its appearance, months before a young girl in Utah vanished mysteriously, months before a young woman in Washington, DC, having abruptly and involuntarily taken leave of family and friends, was found in tragic circumstances. That THE LOVELY BONES should have its birth in the midst of these events is, accordingly, happenstance. Any sensationalism imputed to Alice Sebold, the author, or her publisher, for the timing of it would be worse than wrong-headed; it would be deliberately and maliciously ignorant on any number of levels. No, THE LOVELY BONES deserves notice solely upon its own merits, which are considerable and ultimately immeasurable by any current standard we may have. <br />  <br /> Sebold has one previous work to her credit, that being the nonfiction LUCKY, a haunting account of the author's rape at age 18. THE LOVELY BONES is a haunting work as well, but in the literal sense of the word --- for the narrator of THE LOVELY BONES is a 14-year-old girl murdered during the commission of an unspeakable act committed by a quiet, monstrous man of such vileness that the reader wants nothing other than to reach into the pages of the book, grab him, and rip his face off. The victim, Susie Salmon (&quot;like the fish,&quot; as she tells us early on), relates her fate with a poetic matter-of-factness; she is at peace as she narrates, from her heaven, an account of what happened before and after her death as well as the repercussions of her death upon her family. What she wants is that her family achieve peace and that her murderer encounter justice.  <br />  <br /> What is most striking in THE LOVELY BONES, however, is Susie's description of heaven, a place of many things to many souls. Some of the places intersect in spots, some do not. One has only to wish for a good reason for something in order to acquire it. When Jesus Christ said &quot;My Father's room has many mansions&quot; He was talking about Susie's heaven. Susie is able to witness events on Earth without the limitations imposed by time and space, and can thus witness her family, friends, and murderer, and know what they are thinking and doing. Sebold's writing is masterful --- no, it's incredible. Although Susie's voice never manifests itself beyond a quiet peacefulness, her tale of what has gone before and what is to be excites a passionate desire to know what is to happen to those left behind. Susie's subtle delight in her burgeoning ability to influence things on this side of the shade raises hope that she will be able to fully realize her desire to bring peace to her family, who seem irrevocably fractured as the trauma of her sudden, senseless disappearance and passing lays fatal stress on already fractured relationships. It is, in the end, a false hope; but things have a way of working out in the end for how they are supposed to be, and they work out without Susie's assistance. Well, that's not quite right. Maybe she does help a bit. <br />  <br /> Sebold's bag of talents is large enough and complete enough that THE LOVELY BONES never even approaches the maudlin; readers, however, will be moved to tears several times during their encounter with this work. That Sebold is able to elicit sorrow, righteous anger, regret, and ultimately, hope through a narrative of events in a voice rarely raised above a peaceful whisper is a statement to the level of her artistry. If she never writes another word she will be known for decades for this work. <br />  <br /> --- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub <br />
B000005S6B|5.0|I've listened to this many times over 13 years, but something recently connected with me in the song Medley.  It is the pinnacle of the album, quietly hiding late in the mix and devoid of the big hooks in the better known songs.  Its the heart of the album, and doesn't doesn't stroll, walk, or run but runs screaming with arms flailing.  Its unassuming and stealthy but will knock you over.  If you're up to the task of hanging on, its among the best musical rides you'll find.
B00005NKKV|4.0|The songs on this album are really soft and lovely, but the most memorable songs on here are the title track and \\"I Am a Rock.\\" It's not that the rest of the tracks are bad songs, just not as memorable, critically-acclaimed, or polished as the material on an album like PSR&T is. The two hits are padded out with nine filler songs; the most enjoyable of them are \\"Kathy's Song,\\" \\"April Come She Will\\" (a gorgeous song based on a childrens' nursery rhyme), \\"Leaves That Are Green,\\" \\"Blessed\\" (based on some Biblical verses), and the two suicide songs, \\"Richard Cory\\" and \\"A Most Peculiar Man,\\" which are placed back to back (on purpose?). \\"Somewhere They Can't Find Me\\" is a faster version and lyrical reworking of the earlier slow song \\"Wednesday Morning, 3 AM,\\" and \\"Anji\\" is an interesting instrumental which was written by Davy Graham. \\"We've Got a Groovy Thing Goin'\\" is upbeat enough, but the mere title really dates the song; who says \\"groovy\\" anymore? Overall they're all good songs, but taken in comparison to their later albums just not as memorable or mature.
0062515675|1.0|Unfortunately, I WASTED my hard earned money on this one. I expected a story in the same realm as Paulo Coelho's The Alchemist, because that was the way it was marketed in my bookstore. However, what I found was a trite and shallow narrative about how a multi-millionaire found peace and harmony in India. Throughout the entire book I kept laughing to myself, shaking my head and thinking, \\"of course this guy found inner-peace, I would too if I had a few million dollars in the bank back home and went on a extended holiday to India.\\" Nice try Robin S. Sharma, I didn't buy into your make-believe world. My recommendation: For all you billionaires out there, you might find a small bit of inspiration in this book. For the rest of us save, your money or better yet, buy another up-lifting book that will actually move you to reach for your dreams. I highly recommend The Alchemist, by Paulo Coelho.
0060012218|5.0|&quot;What was the purpose of the Geography Club?&quot; sixteen-year-old narrator Russel Middlebrook asks himself near the climax of Brent Hartinger's debut novel, a quick-paced chronicle of the founding of a secret gay students' club at Goodkind High School. <br />  <br /> That's a good question in regard to the book, as well as the club. <br />  <br /> While there remains a need for young adult fiction that shows exaggeratedly positive gay role models, Hartinger has done something more daring with GEOGRAPHY CLUB: he shows both gay and straight teenagers being upstanding and understanding; he also shows them being selfish, cliquish and, well, jerkish. This is a good thing. <br />  <br /> As all adults --- and most adolescents --- realize, the American teenager is a moody, capricious creature, occasionally subject to self-esteem shortages, peer pressure and all-purpose insecurity. And if Russel and his pals can put a check next to all of the above, well, readers will know it's a reality check. <br />  <br /> In an effort to write wonderfully realistic characters, Hartinger knows they must sometimes do things that are terribly realistic. So, despite knowing it's wrong, Russel, who's gay, at one point refuses to stand up for Brian, the tormented school spaz. Kevin, Russel's closeted jock boyfriend, joins his teammates in taunting Russel with homophobic remarks. Kevin's best friend Gunnar pushes Kevin into dating girls, despite the fact that he recognizes he's gay. There are scenes in GEOGRAPHY CLUB that will make your stomach knot, because you'll find characters you're fond of doing things they shouldn't do. It's a heck of a lot like high school. <br />  <br /> The purpose of the Geography Club at Goodkind High isn't immediately recognized by any of the gay, lesbian and bisexual characters who make up the club. Once Russel discovers --- via an online chat room (in another sharp bit of realism, he readily acknowledges an attraction to online porn) --- that there are other gay kids in his school, they start an official after-school group so they can socialize and talk about their concerns. They call it the Geography Club, trying to sound boring and nerdy so that they won't be found out: &quot;No high school student in their right minds would ever join that,&quot; thinks Russel. Clearly, there's a vein of shame here, a need to feel hidden and secretive about one's identity. While gay kids surely serve as a good example of this sort of thinking, it's hardly their private domain. What high school student doesn't at some point feel that she is hiding her 'real self' in order to fit in with her social environment. And what high school student (or adult) doesn't eventually feel the need to 'come out' from an inaccurate public persona. <br />  <br /> It turns out that the purpose of the Goodkind High Geography Club is a temporary one --- a short, important first step in Russel and company's longer journey toward accepting themselves. Throughout the novel, one senses that if these gay kids and their straight schoolmates were more comfortable with themselves, they would be less cruel to each other. When, in the novel's final chapter, the Geography kids officially rename their club The Gay-Straight-Bisexual Alliance, they begin a critical second step, not just in the coming out process, but in the growing up process as well. <br />  <br /> --- Reviewed by Jim Gladstone <br />

B000002LFU|4.0|I love this recording, even if not everything on it is absolutely top-flight R.E.M. But there's enough invention here to justify anyone's buying this and getting hours of pleasure out of it.  <br />  <br />Favorites are Pop Song 89, Stand, Get Up and Orange Crush, the latter track being one of the most chilling of their output.  All of these are irresistibly catchy, very well played with high production values, and recorded with a clarity that makes Michael Stipe & Co. seem right in your living room.  <br />  <br />No, this project isn't as edgy as their earlier work, but I still like most of what's here.  Even so-so R.E.M. is a good bit better than many other bands out there.  (And hey, just program out what you don't care for.)
B0000C6E4D|4.0|'Afterglow' is the much anticipated and long overdue followup to 'Surfacing' by Sarah Mclachlan. the album at times can seem quite familiar at times as if you've heard this from her before. she went with the 'if it ain't broken then don't fix it' approach. this album has nothing new and mind-blowing that will amaze you, it's just the good music that's she's been making that we've come to love from her. the album boasts some fantastic new songs like 'Fallen', the lead single, 'World on Fire', 'Time' & 'Stupid', the 2nd single. however there exist a few mediocre tracks like 'Push' & 'Drifting' which i don't feel quite live up to her past work or even that present on this album. not to worry though they're not bad, they're just not up to her standards. the album in general is an album that after some time you'll come to treasure. At first, i thought this album disgraced Sarah but now i see it's some really good work. i won't say it's better than 'Surfacing' but this a healthy attempt as a follow up and promises good work from her in the future. all i can say is that it's fantastic to have her back!

B00004TJWE|5.0|The Pretty Things' 1968 album \\"S.F. Sorrow\\" did not 'cause much attention when it was originally released.<br /><br />The band had already shown, with their previous album \\"Emotions\\", that they wanted to explore new grounds, and that they felt that the r&b concept was too limited for them.<br /><br />\\"Emotions\\" showed that the band possesed excellent songwriters in Wally Allen, Phil May and Dick Taylor. Unfortunately the production of that album was not too successful; at least at the time it was considered as some kind of a \\"disaster\\".<br /><br />This is not the case with the follow-up album \\"S.F. Sorrow\\". The sound is great and Norman Smith's production captured the new psychedelic sounds and trends of the late 1960's perfectly.<br /><br />\\"S.F. Sorrow\\" is a concept album, which tells the sad story of the life of S.F. Sorrow. The idea of doing rock concept album was very new at this time. And Pretty Things were among the very first to come up with a rock album; but in my opinion this is not what makes \\"S.F. Sorrow\\" a classic album. The album's strength is clearly the music; though the story is quite interesting too.<br /><br />The catchy \\"S.F. Sorrow\\", driven by great acoustic guitars, gives the album the perfect start. The song almost has hit-record potentials.<br /><br />The musically more complex \\"Bracelets\\" follows. It's a song in the same vein as their great \\"progressive\\" 1967 single \\"Defecting Grey\\". The song did not make it to the charts, but I remember that it got some airplay here in Denmark in 1967-68. The song is featured here as a bonus-track.<br /><br />\\"She Says Good Morning\\" indicates that the Pretty Things were also inspired by the Beatles' \\"Revolver\\" album.<br /><br />\\"Private Sorrow\\" is another great track -  the flute and the acoustic guitars almost sounding like Jethro Tull.<br /><br />The dramatic \\"Ballon Burning\\" tells the dramatic story of the \\"Hindenburg\\" crash in which Sorrow's girlfriend dies<br /><br />\\"The mysterious \\"Baron Saturday\\" enters the story in the song of the same title. Great Beatle-like vocals.<br /><br />Musically some of the last tracks are obviously songs that serve to tie the story together and not meant to stand alone.<br /><br />2 tracks stand out, though.  \\"Trust\\" and the sad but very beautiful finale \\"The loneliest Person\\" featuring only an acoustic guitar and Phil May's vocals.<br /><br />The 4 bonus tracks are 2 Columbia singles released in 1967-68.

B0000042H4|4.0|In this review, I will compare Solti's Ring with Karajan's (I haven't yet heard Bohm's, and I leave out the historical Rings [Furtwangler, Knappertsbusch, etc.] because of comparatively poor sound quality, which is likely to turn off many listeners).  To be honest, I don't think it compares very favorably.  On the positive side, the cast is more or less a who's who of the greatest singers of the late 1950's, early 1960's, so vocally the set is magnificent.  On the other hand, characterization-wise, this Ring is good, but not as good as some would make you believe.  I think that Nilsson's Brunnhilde is quite typical in this respect, towering power with little genuine feeling.  Of course, the old Wagnerian standby's (Hotter, Flagstad, etc.) are masters of their roles, but vocally they are clearly past their prime here.  In Karajan's Ring, the singers are sometimes not as vocally secure as those in Solti's, but the best (Janowitz, Vickers, Dernesch, Brilioth, and many others) are quite beautiful vocally, and all of the cast gets their characterization spot on.  The Vienna Philharmonic does a fine job, but again, not nearly as well as many would have you believe.  The sound the orchestra produces is frequently rough and not very well balanced (especially with the brass): frankly, the orchestral playing is not even in the same league as the sublime playing Karajan gets out of his Berliners.  Then one comes to the overall interpretation.  Some find Solti's approach (squeeze as much sonic power out of the score as is humanly possible) thrilling; I find it rather boring after a while.  Generally speaking, he paces the score quite poorly: the big moments of the Ring, those defining moments when the work transcends organized sound to a higher state of being, are simply played more loudly than the rest of the opera, with little buildup of tension leading to these great releases.  Comparing this with Karajan's wonderful sense of poetry and majesty does this set little good. I have repeatedly heard reviewers say how un-dramatic Karajan's set is, but in fact I find the big moments in Karajan's Ring to be far more inspiring: I always get tears in my eyes with Wotan's farewell to Brunnhilde (Leb wohl, du kuhnes herrliches Kind), an effect entirely absent with Solti's Ring.  Then there is the recording quality, which is quite excellent in both; on the other hand, this set has innumerable special effects (many of which have been listed in other reviews) which I simply find distracting.  I feel that they have much more entertainment value than really contributing to the dramatic essence of the Ring.<br /><br />  In short, if you like sheer sonic power, you might like this Ring, but if you are looking for deeper meaning, beauty, poetry, I suggest Karajan's Ring; if you can tolerate poor sound, I highly recommend Furtwangler, by far the greatest Wagnerian on record, who has the deepest insights of all..

B00007LTIA|5.0|If you are reading this, you probably want to know if it is worth the money to buy Tales from Topographic Oceans yet again. Is this new package worth it? The answer is a resounding YES!!! [no pun intended]. The sound is much improved, and this is true for every instrument. The vocal arrangements are well-balanced for the first time, revealing a layer of complexity it was difficult to detect on album and the first 2 CD releases. The drums sound fantastic (ditto on the Close to the Edge remaster) and you can really hear the misc. percussion instruments that were previously buried in the mix. The main instruments all sound wonderful. When CTTE was first remastered, the keyboards were too high and Steve Howe was buried in the mix. I feared this might be the case on this album, but on this Tales remaster the balance of all instruments is spot-on. Tonally, the timbre of Howe's guitars is improved by the remaster and the bass also has increased presence. I highly recommend this CD on the basis of the improved sound alone. I own other CDs from the YES remasters, and this ranks with the best in terms of improved sound quality. <br /> As for the bonus tracks: If you love Tales and know it by heart, you will appreciate them. They are rough mixes, and the lyrics and vocals are very much works in progress. They are bonus tracks, and that is all that can really be said about them. I do enjoy them very much, but I love this music. To a die-hard Yes fan and Tales lover they do add value to the CD. However, the CD is worth buying without the bonus tracks. <br /> The only thing I think would improve this set would be for the keyboard introduction to The Revealing Science of God to be a seperate track. This would allow those of us who prefer to listen to this track the way it is on vinyl (Dawn of light...) could skip the introduction.  <br /> You either love Tales or you don't. It is my favorite Yes album and my favorite album of all time. So, I will not try to persuade you one way or the other. I am simply writing this review to help those who do love this CD determine if it is a good value. It is. <br />  <br />

0452277752|5.0|It makes me somewhat angry that a book like Rage has to be shelved because of an incident like Columbine.  It's one of the best books I've read in a long time, a book I would tell other to read in an instant, but I can't.  The novel has been pushed in to oblivion because it deals with a school shooting.  Yes, it deals with teenagers being violent, and blowing up emotionally, and then it also deals with them coming to grips with everything, realizing who they are.  That may be what disturbes most people about this book.  When they realize who they are, what they realize is far from pretty.  But at no point did the story feel forced.  Everything these teens said fit with their characters.  Everything they did fit with what was being thrown at them.   <br /> <br />Do I think this book is dangerous?  Not at all!  It actually shows the danger of holding your fears and problems inside.  That's why Charlie went crazy.  He held everything inside, just so he could conform to the norm.  And conforming led him to something... well, read the book and find out.  That's why, in the end, everything works out in it's own twisted way.  And yes, this book is twisted.  Very twisted.  But not dangerous.  What happens in the end was was truelly frightening though.  If you can get your hands  on a copy, grab it.  You'll never be able to put the book down.  The pace is fast, the story is amazing, and the characters are so well thought out that you'll feel that you may have actually known them.  This is one of King's best books.

It starts off with two relitively short segments bulding up to the epic Time then transfering though The Great Gig in the Sky(a magestic piano driven epic)to the second high point of the album Money. this is the song that can most easily be passed off as a run of the miss rock song.(alot of radio stations play the edited version which edits out most of the gitar solo which would make even Jimmy Page get up and play the air guitar)Then comes my personal favorite Us and Them a seven minute masterpiece soft and erie. Next is another tarsition Any Color You Like and then Brain Damage/eclips a majestic and fitting closing to the album. <br />  <br /> Also the album is a perfect soundtract to the wizard of oz if you start it right after the MGM lion roars the third time. <br />  <br /> This album is a testament to the the talent and questionable sanity of bassist/singer and writer Roger Waters

B000089RVX|5.0|Another hot goth chick?  You bet.  But boy can she sing.  These songs grab you, shake you down, take your feelings hook 'em up to jumper cables, and you live for the first time.  No, not frankenstein, but the power of these tracks are frightening.  Yes you need to bow down.  Tourniquet - I can hear the heart pumping out blood through the slit wrists, My Immortal - oh my I cried.  Bring me to Life says it all.  Best CD I have heard in 10 years.  Do yourself a favor, skip the next tattoo and spend your money on something that will save your forsaken soul.

B00023BLXK|3.0|I knew it wouldn't be as good as the original, but I don't think it is as bad as it has been made out to be, particularly the dancing. From what I could see of the actors, they looked really good. Unfortunately, the camera almost always shot them from the waist up so you couldn't really feel the dance or even know if they weren't messing up. The only thing you could make out was whether they were supposed to be dirty or ballroom dancing. In fact, the only dance I could see clearly, and thus the most riveting, was the recreation of the original dirty dance with the Patrick Swayze cameo. Even when the actors finally get to their big routine you don't get to see much of it due to camera angles and the plot twist. I only harp on the dancing aspects because I am sure many other people will be interested in this movie, as I was, for dancing. The dancing is good but you see so little of it is not very inspiring.  <br /> <br />In fact, it didn't really feel like a dancing movie. The dancing almost seemed to be a subplot to the Cuban revolution theme. The themes of the  different social classes and the revolution felt trite though. It didn't seem to fit in the movie too fluidly and it was not dealt with in depth.  <br /> <br />Other detractions of the movie were the simplictic language used, the youthful pubescent look of the leading man which made it hard to look at him dirty dance without feeling uncomfortable, and the inconsistent texture of the movie. What I mean by texture is nothing that really detracts from the plot, just little things which seem implausible. I found it hard to believe this rich, protective, socialite family would, upon discovering their young, high school daughter's romantic relationship with a lower class Cuban would allow her to spend entire nights away from the family in revolutionary Cuba.  <br /> <br />On a more positive note, the visual look of the movie made it a treat for the eyes. The colors and scenery were delectable. The music was a pleasure to hear. And although the dialogue is simple, it is pleasantly interspersed with Spanish language (which is refreshing after seeing many movies set in other countries where not only do the main characters not speak the language, but have no accent!).  <br /> <br />Overall, the movie is not hard to watch. It is rather pleasant. However it is not exactly a must-see and of course it does not compare to Dirty Dancing. <br /> <br />

020530902X|5.0|In his 288 page book, &quot;On Writing,&quot; Stephen King sings the praises of Strunk and White's &quot;The Elements of Style,&quot; then proceeds to violate one of their cardinal rules: &quot;avoid needless words.&quot; It's a mistake made by almost every book meant to assist the writer on the rules of the craft. There are plenty available, too many, in fact, but none have ever improved on Strunk and White's comparatively tiny volume.<br /><br /> Everything you need to know to improve your writing is here in a style that adheres to the advice offered. Strunk and White don't tell you how to write, they show you in prose as entertaining as it is educational. You've heard that less is more? The authors prove it in little more than 100 pages.<br /><br /> If you want a handy guide to more effective writing, Strunk and White's &quot;The Elements of Style&quot; is the only one you'll need.<br /><br /> Brian W.

B000286S8S|1.0|This album contains 14 of the 17 tunes on the Best of...Vol 1. No wonder it's not called Vol 2. Don't get me wrong, I love the songs on this compilation, but I could have done without all the repeats. Many of us today have multidisk cd players so a new selection called Vol 2 would have been complimentary to Vol 1. Now, Vol 1 is just an annoyance to have to pull out for the 2 songs that only appear on it. <br />  <br /> C'mon guys!!! Get with the program. If you really want to put out a first class record, break out the master tapes from Van Halen 3. Let Sammy re-write the lyrics and let someone, who knows what they are doing, re-mix it. (Eddie, step away from the board. Just play your little guitar and leave the technical stuff and lyrics to the pros.)  <br />  <br /> For a true BEST OF... dump all your original VH records to MP3, burn them on one disk and play at random. If there's a song you don't like, leave it off the disk. Imagine...you decide which are the best songs for your taste and are not at the mercy of the record company or the artist. Personally, I don't think VH needs a Best of... Each album accomplishes this. (Except VH3 but that's due to poor lyric writting and mixing...as stated above).
0140431179|5.0|The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde is a masterful short story.  This is a fun, quick read about a man, his dark side, and friends who wish to save him.  Robert Louis Stevenson is certainly a great writer and it shows in this short story; Stevenson at his best!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I enjoy this CD.  Avril has a lot more of a mature sound to her with this CD.  Like one reveiwer mentioned, it's a bit darker.  Some of the songs have a rocking sound that are great to workout to (especially if venting out some frusteration).  I would recommend this CD to any Avril fan and anyone interested in getting to know her music.
0316776963|4.0|I too feel like the gushing reviews somewhat dampened my otherwise pleasant experience with this book.  For me, it would have been better without so many critics insisting I would love the book.  But that said, he IS funny and this book is well worth reading.  His self-deprecation grounds the story, and his characterizations of his family are incredibly vivid.  I just wish future editions would pare down the reviewers' comments.
B000002I25|4.0|Let me preface my review by stating my opinion that the Doors were possibly the most over-rated band in the history of rock. A &quot;fan&quot; of this band, I most certainly am not. <br />  <br /> Now that's out of the way, this is still a heck of an album. With the possible exception of Krieger, these guys were pretty much third-rate talents who happened to be fortunate enough to be swept up at the top of a countercultural wave that was peaking right when they happened upon the scene, though it would be unfair to say that they didn't do their bit in adding their fair share to it. I think this goes a long way toward explaining why the Doors' first album is so much better than everything else that would follow.  <br />  <br /> Everyone knows about Morrison and his penchant for weird themes/lyrics, and though he doesn't sound like anything special at all today it has to be remembered that he was the first (or among the first) to introduce this sort of thing to the rock idiom. Krieger was an OK guitar player, nothing special. Manzarek's organ playing is right around third or fourth-grade level, and Densmore was competent on drums without being exceptional.  <br />  <br /> Great songwriting also wasn't anybody's forte in this band, but I think creative inspiration from the &quot;Zeitgeist&quot; I inferred to above helped to elevate the unit as a whole, and enabled them to make a better record than (in ordinary circumstances) they would have been capable of making.  <br />  <br /> You've all heard the songs a million times, so there's no need to rehash what I think is cool about the great ones and what I think sucks about the others.  <br />  <br /> My point is simply that even if you dislike the Doors, DON'T dismiss this first record. I hope I don't sound too pompous with this, but I've heard just about every rock record under the sun from the mid 60s onward and in all that music, it's tough to find something that beats that middle solo part on &quot;Light My Fire&quot;.... Standard 4/4, two minor chords, elementary organ playing, a good guitar solo......and it all somehow comes together to make three minutes of pure, absolute heaven. If the rest of this disc was pure, unadulterated trash (and it is not), I'd still own it just for those three glorious minutes.
B00000K19E|5.0|This is THE movie. I never grow tired of it. Though I've watched it literally hundreds of times, it just gets better and better. One hundred years from now, when movies will no longer exist and people will be playing along in holodecks, if they choose one movie to represent this era, I hope this movie wins hands down. <br />  <br /> &quot;...I didn't come here to tell you how it's going to end, I've come here to tell you how it's going to begin.&quot;
B000093BDX|4.0|I realize a one-album greatest hits package has to be picky, but why isn't Sail On Sailor on this album? Of all their great hits, I think this one has stood the test of time better than almost all of the other beach songs. It's a glaring ommission that mars an otherwise great collection.
B0000CBHOI|2.0|I'm a big blues fan but was very disappointed with this series. <br />  <br /> The problem, to me, is the concept: have movie directors make films about the blues. This leads to trying to come up with some &quot;plot&quot; to carry each installment.  <br />  <br /> In striving to come up with a storyline, most of the directors came up with the same one: a contemporary musician (blues guitarist Corey Harris, rapper Chuck D) travels someplace to find his musical roots in some form of the blues (Delta blues, Chicago blues). <br />  <br /> This repetitive storyline leaves no room for the history of the blues. <br />  <br /> Another problem is that not only are the storylines repeated, but so are many of the film clips and songs. <br />  <br /> I do have to single out the episode Clint Eastwood directed about piano players. It was excellent, and the concept (have piano player Eastwood interview and play with legendary pianists) sets it apart from the other episodes. <br />  <br /> My advice: buy the CDs from the series and skip the video.  <br />
B0002DB52M|4.0|I'm glad to see this movie has finally made it on DVD and VHS in the States. It took a long time to do so. Lars von Trier follows up Dancer in the Dark, with an even darker view of small town life in America. In this case, we find a town quite literally at the end of the road, buried in a hollow somewhere in West Virginia, where the denizens are reduced to having to pick up the scraps left behind by others and live out a marginal existence. But, in its midst there is a dreamer, Tom, who at first appears to be the moral bellwether of the community. He tries to convince the community to take in a fugitive, evocatively played by Nicole Kidman, and finds that he has to make certain concessions in order to do so.<br /><br />This film unfolds on stage as a highly theatrical telling, lending to the story the strong sense of a parable. Von Trier has assembled an impressive cast including old favorites Lauren Bacall and Ben Gazzara. The story builds slowly, with some fascinating twists and turns before reaching its shattering climax. It reminded me a lot of Shirley Jackson's classic story, The Lottery, but seems to owe more to the small town vision of Sinclair Lewis and Thornton Wilder.<br /><br />I suppose some will be turned off by von Trier's disturbing view of small town life, but this film is masterfully handled, and shows what an accomplished director he is, drawing the most from his actors, in particular Nicole Kidman.
B00000AFHM|5.0|OK, this album came out around 6 years ago...if u don't have it, shame on you....u call yourself an &quot;indie&quot; rocker??? huh tough guy?&quot;?? well, you're not. Buy this album, cause it will make you a better person. Oh sorry.... did someone make you mad at work today??....listen to this album. Oh sorry... did your girl break up with you???...listen to this album. Did the world end????.... listen to this album. Trust me. I'm a trustable person.
B000268QB2|4.0|Shades of Supertramp and Depeche Mode....  Of course, the Coldplay comparison is obvious but there's something less slick and packaged about Keane that makes them appealing....  Definitely worth a listen but the tunes are lovelorn enough that you might need a drink.
B00024BHTC|4.0|This will be my 7th Nightwish CD (counting the two MCD &quot;Wishmastour 2000&quot; and &quot;Over The Hills And Far Away&quot;). After the dissapointment with &quot;Century Child&quot; and pretty sure the band was about to make a transition from Tarja to Marco as main vocalist, plus to put down the metal edge of the band &quot;Once&quot; came to prove me wrong..and right. <br /> The band didn't let Tarja go, but Marco's voice still too prominent for my taste (I love's Marco's band Tarot and his vocals THERE, not here). <br /> Yes Tarja is NOT as operatic as she was in the begining of the band, but she hasn't lost her voice either (that goes to the many crapsters out there speaking garbage when they don't have anything intelligent to say in a review, I wonder why Amazon let anything to go without a moderator). <br /> The band has lost a bit of metal edge going symphonic, but on the other hand some of the riffs in this album are the heaviest yet by Emppu, so is a 50% situation. <br /> 'The Siren'which is basically Marco singing with Tarja making background chant is most definitively a down, on the other hand 'Dark Chest Of Wonders' is an up, so is 'Dead Gardens'. <br />  <br /> I can go on and on with pro and cons, but I'll let the owner of the album to decide by itself. As for me I'll recommend to the band: <br />  <br /> a) Bring Tarja's opera side back <br /> b) Let Marco play bass..in silence <br /> c) Store the symphonic orchestra and play more heavy fast riffs <br /> d) Summary: make another &quot;Oceanborn&quot; mixed with &quot;Wishmaster&quot; and keep like that, we'll be here too. <br />  <br />
B0001MDP3G|4.0|Cold Mountain, the story of sacrifice and love between two citizens of a small Southern town, leads you as the viewer on a roller coaster of emotion.  From joy, humor, to pity and sadness.<br /><br />Interesting as it should the tragedy on both the war front and the home front.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed the character Ruby played by Renee Zwelliger and I thought Jude Law played a convincing tragic hero.<br /><br />Nicole Kidman did not have much to work with and I thought she did well eventhough she did not fit the part in my eyes.<br /><br />The plot and story moved well, and one of the more poignant moments was acted out by Natalie Portman.  We have a newborn so it tore our hearts to see her predicament and the cruelty that war brings out.<br /><br />A good movie that kept my attention,even with the tragic ending.
0790731002|4.0|I'm a huge Batman fan. I've liked him ever since I was a little kid. He's always been such a dark edgy superhero, and not quite such the goody good like Superman. The first time I saw this movie I loved it. Almost 10 years later though I've seen some flaws that have taken it from a 5 star to a 4 star. <br /> <br />Two Face(Jones) is back on the rise in Gotham City. He wants Batman(Kilmer) dead and keeps bring out tricks to kill the dark knight. Dr. Chase Meridian(Kidman) is a shrink that comes to Gotham to help the police and batman bring him in. What she gets is a huge crush on the dark knight. <br /> <br />In the meantime a former Wayne Industries employee named Edward Enigma(Carrey) is on the rise. He wants to see Bruce Wayne ruined because Wayne wouldn't fund his project that could control and manipulate brain waves. Enigma becomes the Riddler and teams up with Two Face so both can acomplish their goals. <br /> <br />Bruce Wayne has also fallen for the good Dr. Meridian. While the two are at a circus fundraiser Two Face strikes. He kills The Flying Graysons all except for the youngest Dick(O'Donnell). Wayne gives him a place to stay and Robin is born. Now the two must team up to save the city, the girl, and confront their own demons all at the same time. <br /> <br />I liekd the cast they put together for this one. Kilmer is a good Batman. He can play the billionaire playboy and he has the dark edge to be Batman. Nicole Kidman is Nicole Kidman and she's great. She's hot in the movie, and thats really what she is there for. O'Donnell was a good choice for Robin, the character just stinks in the movie. <br /> <br />The Bad guys are awesome. Jones as Two Face is great. He's much better than the original guy they had as Harvey Dent in Billy Dee Williams. He's funny and he plays the split personality to perfection. Jim Carrey is the man. He makes me laugh everytime I see him. He really steals the show as Riddler. These two make the movie <br /> <br />I only have onebig problem with this movie and it's the script. It's full of horrible one liners and dumb cliches. When I was younger I liked it, but the more I see it the more I laugh at how dumb it is. Kilmer and Kidman have nothing to work with for there characters. O'Donnell with Robin is annoying. I just wanted to reach into the screen and slap him. The Bad guys though are pretty good. Carrey and Jones both take their respective parts and run with them. <br /> <br />This is a good Batman movie. It and one are a tie for me as the best one ever done, though the new one looks like it could be the best..well at least on paper. If you can get over the annoying script and a couple of cheesy fights you really will enjoy this movie. Joel Schumacher did an adqueate job directing the movie. Tim Burton was better, but he did tag along and produce this one. <br /> <br />The DVD extras are next to none. I wish they'd put more on there. <br /> <br />If you like Batman you'll like this movie. If your not a big die hard Batman fan, you probaly will sill like it because of the cast and the action is pretty good. I love this film. So go check it out.
B000005S0E|4.0|The Top is the last of the three albums that resulted from the Pornography fall out (excluding the japanese whispers singles). The first of the three was The Glove release Blue Sunshine and the Second was the Banshee's album Hyeana. So one could imagine that an artist who had already contributed musical ideas to two album wouldnt have much left but somehow robert smith pulls it together. Especially on the achingly beautiful &quot;Empty World&quot; and the pop masterpiece the Caterpillar. Sure at times it is apparent that Robert is searching terribly hard for ideas (Bananafishbones). But for the majority of the time Roberts experimints are successful, like on the title song and Dressing Up. Although the album is technically a cure album it is essentially a solo album. Robert Smith described the recording process as him sitting in a room and banging on anything he could to make some music. But its the music not the story that matters and the music is astonishingly good.  <br />
B000286S8S|1.0|This album sucks!  The 3 new tracks sounds like Van Hagar are  now influenced by Nu-Metal.  Why can't they release their live Concert from California with Roth in 83 on DVD?  Hagar's song writing is crap.  He never was able to keep the cheeky song writing of Roth.  In fact I'd recommend Roth's 'best of' album in comparison to this, because the guitaring for starters is better.  Like previous reviews anyway, weve already had one 'best of' album, so why another?  Warner Brothers just wanna keep the money flowing in. Also I noticed when listening to some parts of this CD that the sound stops occasionally, so the CD is flawed.  Overall, if you are a Van Hagar fan, buy it.  But if you are a little weary of listening to the same VH tracks over and over again, avoid!
B00005TT77|5.0|As a second generation Beatles Maniac, I've grown quite accustomed to my favorite tunes sang by the Fab Five. When I first watched this movie, I immediately knew that this soundtrack was one that I would buy and play for a long time to come. The producers did justice to the Beatles and their fans with this CD. Sheryl Crow, Eddie Vedder and many more pay tribute to the Beatles while adding a new flavor and sound to these wonderful classics. This CD took me back to my childhood and filled me with fond memories (Sarah McLachlan's singing Blackbird) brought tears to my eyes. If you're a Beatles Fan, this CD is a must have.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Hmmm..I admit Avril Lavigne did mix up something a bit different for her fans. Ahhh..but hold on my friends, just because it's something different doesn't make it good. Now when I first listen to this album and looked at Avril's *ahem* new sense of style I thought Amy Lee rip-off. Now while Amy Lee doesn't really have any original sense of style either (i.e her ripping-off Lacuna Coil) anyone with eyes could see Avril's copying off of Amy. *ahem* Anyway, back to the music. Avril's new sound sounds a bit like Michelle Branch's &quot;Are you happy now&quot;, remixed a bunch of times to create an album. Her attempt to sound &quot;rock&quot; has failed terribly. Instead of sounding pop now she sounds pop/rock. But people that are fans of her might still enjoy her new sound. And even the people that hated her before might enjoy her new style now. She sounds a bit like Evanescence with a more poppier/softer sound. All her songs (except the last 2) are about her ex-boyfriends or some kind of boy. Basically she's like Dashboard Confessional with a female angle. Her lyrics are so simple that Barney's Sing Along tape probably used bigger and more educated words than she did. Example: Her chorus to her song &quot;Who Knows&quot;-Who knows what could happen? Do what you do, Just Keep on laughing, one thing's true, there's always a brand new day, i'm gonna live today like it's my last day...&lt;-simple much? Her lyrics are so dumb that they sometimes don't even make sense. Oh, and don't even get me started on the voice. Two words for it though: Dying cat. Anyway I hope I helped you, but to sum this up, if you like pop/rock, you'll probably like this album. Or even if you like just pop you'll like it.
B0001MDPV8|4.0|...If you've only recently become a Nas fan, and you don't own Illmatic, this album is a must-buy. After 10 years, Illmatic is still the blueprint of east-coast rap. Nas has been, and still remains one of the best lyricists in the game. It's true this album is very short, but in most cases, long doesn't always mean GOOD, and Nas keeps it short and sweet here. If you haven't heard classics like 'Life's a B****' (featuring AZ), and 'The World is Yours', you haven't listened to real east-coast hip-hop.<br /><br /> Like I mentioned earlier, this album is perfect if you don't already own Illmatic for some reason, because it's the original album, with upgraded sound quality. The remixes and unreleased tracks could have been better though, but they are still a nice addition. So spend a few extra bucks and pick this one up instead of the original, it IS worth it.
0385512104|4.0|I found this a fascinating and enjoyable (and quick) read.  Christopher Boone's logical approach to life taught me much.  (Yes, I saw 4 red cars in a row today and it is a VERY GOOD DAY).  It is a book about taking risks, trusting loved ones, and overcoming fear and weakness to journey outside our comfort zone.  I recommend this book (it's not for kids, however.. too many F-bombs for my comfort).
B0000DD7LB|4.0|All you guys giving this album less than 3 stars are just hatin on this woman. You guys need to stop all the &quot;She's not real music&quot; bull crap, because the tracks on this recond are red hot. If your truly gave this record a chance, there is no possible way you can give it less than 3 stars. If Rolling Stone (the most popular music magazine), Spin, People, and all the other reviewers like it gave it a good review then their is something to it. &quot;Me Against The Music&quot; is a traffic jam of hot beats that keeps you pumped up until the end of the song. The sassy &quot;Showdown&quot; is one of my favorite songs on this record, while &quot;Breathe On Me&quot; and &quot;Early Mornin'&quot; glittering beats add to the trance appeal of this album. The hottest songs on the album are all influenced by todays fascination with Hip-Hop, like &quot;Boom Boom&quot;, &quot;Outrageous&quot;, and &quot;The Hook Up&quot; that all pound you senseless with rhythm that forces you to get up and dance. The two best and most irresistable tracks though are &quot;Touch Of My Hand&quot; and &quot;Everytime&quot;. Both of these songs are equally fantastic and deserve a listen. If you want scorching hot club songs, and slow-motion ballads like &quot;Shadow&quot; than this album is worth a buy.
B000286S8S|1.0|No wonder Warner Brothers dumped Van Halen years ago if BOBW is all they can do. I am very sorry I bought this hunk of junk. Nothing but a Van ReHash album with 3 new singles that are a total joke. It is obvious no real thought went into making the 3 new tracks or BOBW. And why would anyone mix Van Roth and Van Hagar years tracks together. Just totally stupid!
B000006ZVU|5.0|Firefly is the first album of the short lived (unforunately) John Lawton era. This album is right up there with their classics of the early 70's. John Lawton is just below David Bryon as far as vocal talent and much better than any of his successors. He's more blusier than Byron,but doesn't have the range. <br />  <br /> If you are looking for the heavy side of the band, this album is not it. The material on this album is closer to the laid back tracks that dominate &quot;The Magician Birthday&quot;. <br />  <br /> Breakdown review of the tracks. <br />  <br /> 1. The Hanging Tree - UH returns to the fantasy theme on their earlier albums with this one. Nice guitar echo effects at the songs introduction. <br />  <br /> 2. Been Gone Too Long - Start out slow and then speeds up, though not too loud. Fits Lawton perfectly. <br />  <br /> 3. Who Needs Me. - A Southern rock boogie style song. Songwritter Ken Hensley would leave Heep for Southern rockers a few year later. His interest in Southern fried rock seems to show early here. <br />  <br /> 4. Wise Man - The Wizard, part II. Nice piano ballad that continues the theme of the Wizard on Demon and Wizards. <br />  <br /> 5. Do You Know - The weakest track on the album. A throw away. <br />  <br /> 6. Rollin On - Could easily be mistaken for a Paul Rogers' Bad Company ballad. Good song though. <br />  <br /> 7. Sympathy - Nice mid temple rocker. <br />  <br /> 8. Firefly - One of the best epic UH has ever done. Song by organist/guitarist Ken Hensley. Nice soft keyboards and accoustic guitars. Has a Crosby, Still, & Nash feel to it. <br />  <br /> 9. Crimes of Passion - Another song with a Bad Company feel to it. <br />  <br /> 10 A Far Better Way - This is a bonus track that should have made it on the original album. A soft ballad that sounds like it's was song by Ken Hensley (Doesn't sound like Lawton's gritty voice). Could have been an Elton John song. <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />
B0002858YS|4.0|This song stands out because of the electronics that the guitars lazily layer over. When listening to this CD I don't even hear the lyrics sometimes.  <br /> I really like the sound. I was a little wary of anything with &quot;The ____&quot; as a band name, but I'm glad I saw &quot;Somebody Told Me&quot; on MTV. The songs work like lights flashing briefly by while driving 60 around the city. It seems fitting that these guys are from L.A. <br /> So what exactly is different about the Killers as opposed to the White Stripes, the Strokes, the Hives, etc etc? I don't have a clue, because I can't stand any of the previously mentioned. Maybe that's what is so attractive about this piece...it is unpretentious, and not really Hipster music. They seem to truly have a soul that lives somewhere in this album. I recommend the first track, Jenny Was A Friend of Mine. You know what you're getting into. Overall, a great effort, and as an artist, I must say...very nice cover design.
B000063JZQ|4.0|Polanski's adaptation of Shakespere's great play is a masterpiece in film. Polanski follows the basic theme and plot of the play but emphasizes more on the murderous madness of MacBeth and his devious wife.    Polanski focuses a substantial amount of time on the gruesome murder of King Duncan. The scene succeeds in showing how MacBeth's mind is overtaken by madness and how pointless his crime really is. The scene with the witches also adds an element of the occult: emphasizing how credulence and superstition lead to foul thoughts and deeds. Taking into account that the film was done shortly after the Manson killings, one can see some parrallels with Polanski's adaptation.    I find this film to be one of the finest (but not most faithful) adaptations to one of the bard's most somber plays.
B0000AQVCL|2.0|I kinda liked Jet when I heard their Cold Hard .... song.  But personally, I don't like the fact that these guys are so banal ALL the TIME.  I read an interview of them, and they sure seem to be lovin' the rock star style, with all their women and drugs.  Well, good for you guys.  But here's a tip.  Next time, at least create music that deserves that lifestyle, and not the same song on every track.  I seriously thought my player was skipping like mad, everything sounded regurgitated.  All I'll give them is that they can play good (and that's mostly because the licks were borrowed from old masters.)  But then again, I know 10 year olds that can play Stairway to Heaven.  So try a little harder, guys, and maybe I'll have a listen, but for now, I think I'll stick to something a little more authentic.
B000005JA8|1.0|Mega-garbage hand crafted by non-musicians for pseudo-intellectuals with built-in cloth ears. <br /> <br />Also recommended: <br /> <br />Lou Reed Metal machine Music <br /> <br />Miles Davis Bitches Brew(the 4 disc box set with ultra long bonus tracks for extended torture). <br /> <br />Get it yet?
B0000DD7LB|2.0|I really did try to listen to this album. But it is really a sad effort. Her first album was tolerable. This is pure trash. I never wanted to even hear it, but I decided to give it a listen. It is pure trash, just like her public lifestyle. The songs are at most, predictable, the lyrics are downright BANAL, and only a couple songs on this CD are &quot;club ready&quot;. It is microwave ready. Here's the reasoning behind my decision. <br /> -Me Against the Music-first if all, Madonna sucks. But really, the music is horrible. It is inconsistent, beats all over the place, but unconvincing as spontaneous, and doesn't really capture the idea of getting into sync with the music's beat. Ugh.  <br /> -I Got That(Boom Boom)-My LORD. The Yin Yang Twins? WHYYY I ask you. They take more away from the song than they add. And what's this dedication to southern boys? This is just a weird song, here. <br /> -Showdown-Just not good. I don't want to hear her TALK on every song. Then again...her singing isn't exactly a treat either. <br /> -Breathe on Me-A decent song. Very club-ready. I like the tune alot, and her vocals are kinda nice here. She should work more often with this idea of club music and not RnB. RnB needs help anyways. <br /> -Early Mornin'-More talking, and her trying to convince me that she is hardcore. Hah. Blech. This would be a good song if it wasn't like a bad hangover. Or about one. <br /> -Toxic-A much better single than Against the Music. The lyrics are stupid, but the music is kinda creative. I like the looping. So yeah, this is the 2nd decent song on the CD. <br /> -Outrageous-Oh man. She's trying to convince me she's hardcore again. Who is she trying to convince, me or herself? These are just a few things on her list of outrageous things she boasts-her partying skills, how her jeans look, her world tour, her sex drive, her shopping sprees. And then she goes into a weird cultural guy chanting. Whatever culture that is, I'm sure that they would be offended. I can't tell you HOW much I hate this song.  <br /> -Touch of My Hand-Beautiful intro. Sounds like a downtempo lounge tune, until she starts singing, her voice way lower than sounds natural. Overall, this a a marginally decent song. Mostly the music is nice. I don't like the theme. Ungraceful lyrics. <br /> -The Hook Up-No Doubt did the dancehall deal better. The music is cohesive, at best...I don't know, I don't like it, especially her lyrics. &quot;Drop lowa, to the flowa&quot;? What? Anyways... <br /> -Shadow-Her voice sounds nice in this one. Britney seems to know how to pick clothes (though many times her outfits are questionable...) but she needs to pick tunes that flatter her voice, like this one. This is one of the best tracks on this awful CD. <br /> -Brave New Girl-No. No no no. Sounds like the influence of Madonna here. Like a regurgitated Material Girl. <br /> -Everytime-Beautiful music. This is the best song here. End of story. <br />  <br />  <br /> So all in all, I feel that thought this CD sucked, I gave it a legit review, explaining my opinions. In the end, for $13.49, you walk away with 4 decent tunes (Toxic, Everytime, Shadow and Breathe on Me) Not worth it to me, though.
B00004XPPK|4.0|As World War II ends, a young hustler in Buenos Aires, Argentina, meets a wealthy casino owner with whom he has a lot in common. The hustler, Johnny Farrell (Glenn Ford), becomes the casino's manager and right-hand man to aristocratic Ballin Mundson's (George Macready). The two men become perfect partners in business and close friends. One day, Mundson returns from vacation with a new wife, Gilda (Rita Hayworth), an attractive, headstrong young woman whom Johnny has met before. Gilda's presence threatens the men's relationship and their equilibrium.<br /><br /> Thanks to her smashing rendition of &quot;Put the Blame on Mame&quot;, &quot;Gilda&quot; is Rita Hayworth's best-remembered role. Many have called it a &quot;clothed strip tease&quot;. It's certainly a sexy, energetic, eye-catching performance. Rita Hayworth never sang in movies, though. Anita Ellis provided the voice for &quot;Put the Blame on Mame&quot;.<br /><br /> &quot;Gilda&quot; owes most of its success to Rita Hayworth's charisma. Love triangles are always popular fodder, but this one doesn't make a bit of sense. The story is incomprehensible. The tension that exists between Gilda and Johnny is constantly alluded to, but never explained. The film features the most hateful romance I've ever seen. &quot;Gilda&quot; might be about people imprisoned by their own desires, but to say it is about anything would be presumptuous. &quot;Gilda&quot; has great style, though, and seductive noir-ish characters. So it's entertaining, even if the story is off the wall.<br /><br /> The DVD: Bonus features include one featurette and some odds and ends. &quot;Rita Hayworth: The Columbia Lady&quot; is a 9-minute documentary that follows Hayworth's career at Columbia Studios, where she made 32 films between 1936 and 1953. It doesn't say much, but there are nice film clips. &quot;Vintage Advertising&quot; displays 8 old movie posters for &quot;Gilda&quot;. &quot;Talent File&quot; provides written bios and abridged filmographies for director Charles Vidor and the film's three stars. &quot;Theatrical Trailers&quot; includes 4 old trailers for: &quot;Gilda&quot;, &quot;The Loves of Carmen&quot; (which also starred Hayworth and Glenn Ford), &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot;, and &quot;The Last Hurrah&quot;.

B0001UL7RY|4.0|I owned Let Go for a couple of years and really liked it, even if I suffered tons of flack from my friends for owning it.  I eventually grew to mature with my tastes, and SK8er Boi just didn't satisfy those feelings.  The songs were adolescent and fluffy.  There were many tracks I would skip by last December. <br />   <br />I have new respect for this lady.   <br /> <br />I decided to check the CD out, knowing it would suck big time, but I was suprised.  The tunes are darker, lyrically and musically, with more powerful, passionate guitars.  She is more convincing this time.  Some songs strike me as a bit Linkin Park-ish, but I cannot complain.  She awakens feelings in me with some songs that provoke old angry fires and I really relate.  <br />I think it's very easy to hate this album, unless you go beyond the box and open yourself to the possibility that some of these tunes might be good. I did, and though I'm picky and feel that she still has room to grow even more, Under My Skin moves closer towards a style, form and meaning for Miss Lavigne.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|If you think this album is good then you need to explore the world of music....do you really think this is the best music ?? come on... there is so much music out there that is at least 10 times better than this bullshit
B00006BTCA|5.0|Okay, so maybe I'm 20 and am enchanted with everything, but this CD really does feel great.  Everything about it awakens my senses.  I agree it isn't the best CD ever written.  Some of the lyrics are a little silly, and some are so profound and meaningful on many levels.  The songs move like a book.  They start off with a grasping intro, move to the lulling build, and move around to a rushing high point, and bring you back down just in time for the next song to drift you away.  The CD is like laying in the grass looking up at the clouds until the street lights come on. The first 5 songs are mindblowing alone.  I would definitely give this one a shot.  I thank the person for recommending it to me.
B00008K7AM|5.0|YES, it's been done countless times before from BIG to FREAKY FRIDAY, but what really makes this such a fun movie is the cast.  THE HOT CHICK is your standard role/body reversal flicks, this time it's Rob Schneider's petty thief with caustic teen beauty Rachel MacAdams.  Schneider's impersonation of a teenager is hilarious and witty, and surprisingly very touching.  His rapport with Jessica's best friend, Jessica's father and brother is priceless and engaging.  Whether he's strutting around like a prissy drag queen, or trying to utilize his/her new peeing vessel, Schneider chews up the role and is gloriously funny.  The fart/peeing gags work this time because they are part of the plot--imagine the difficulty a girl might have in using a urinal.  Schneider as the gardener, the janitor, the cheerleader, he's a real hoot.<br /><br />And once again we get the talented and underrated actress Anna Faris in the role of Jessica's friend, April.  Faris has been the heart and soul of the SCARY MOVIE trilogies, a physical, sensual and sensitive performer who gives her all to any role she tackles.  Here she's brilliant as the best friend who finds herself falling in love with the man Jessica's become.  Other wonderful performances include: Michael O'Keefe as Jessica's jock father who wants to rekindle his marital passion; Matt Weinberg as Jessica's little brother, Boogar, who likes to dress up in his sister's clothes; Matthew Lawrence as Billy, Jessica's boyfriend who has a hard time believing Schneider is his girl.  Add Adam Sandler's spacy bongo player in a few hilarious scenes, and you have a very funny, entertaining and surprisingly touching movie.  I think it's Schneider's best so far.  Remember, it is a comedy and you don't have to take it too seriously, but it's worth a look.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|There's so little that's good on television now that any halfway decent show stands out.  So it's hard to be objective about a show like \\"Firefly.\\"  However, I am convinced that Firefly is such a brilliant genre-defining show it would shine in any era, and that science fiction fans will still be watching and talking about this show in thirty or forty years as we do about the original Star Trek today. <br /> <br />When I first heard that Joss Whedon was doing a sci-fi Western, I looked forward to it.  I thought \\"that's great; he's figured out that Science Fiction is the successor genre to the Western.\\"  Both offer limitless possibilities for adventure and action.  It's no coincidence that the popularity of westerns faded around the time movie science fiction started to become popular.   One genre looks back; the other looks ahead.   But I hadn't guessed that Whedon would put the two together quite literally.  One criticism the show gets is the unlikelihood of high and low technology existing together.  I'm sure Whedon has read his Robert Heinlein (Tunnel in the Sky, Farmer in the Sky), and low technology makes sense on a frontier world where there's not much money for power.  (They don't use modern tractors for farming in many parts of the world even today - they use horses and oxen.)  Firefly combines well thought out, logically coherent world building with the adventure and sense of wonder offered by the best space opera.   <br /> <br />The dialogue, special effects, acting, and even the music is top notch.  The worst you can say about the series is that the plotting in some of the episodes is fairly pedestrian.  If you watch the extras, you get the sense that the cast, especially Nathan Fillion who clearly has a deep appreciation of what Whedon is doing, knew that it was part of something special.  The attention to detail is stunning.  Several of the episodes are among the best television I've ever seen - the last half hour of the pilot \\"Serenity\\" just moves, andOut of Gas, and Objects in Space.  Most of the episodes are worth seeing more than once. <br /> <br />Here's hoping the upcoming Serenity movie lives up the show's quality and becomes a success and that we get several more Serenity movies.  And here's hoping that the money people in Hollywood give Joss Whedon carte blanche to do what he wants in the future.  He's the rare talent who can transform genre fiction into art. <br />
0553212737|4.0|So what does a &quot;handsome, clever, and rich&quot; girl like Emma Woodhouse do when she has no professional aspirations and no intention ever to marry? In addition to painting, playing the piano, and condescendingly visiting the poor, she is what might be called a social organizer, which primarily means finding husbands for single women and arranging all the social details involved in doing so. Her decision not to marry stems from her opinion, conceited but sincere, that there's not a man out there who could entertain her as a lifemate; and besides, with her mother pushing up daisies and her older sister Isabella living away in her own marriage, she already has a husband: her father.  <br />  <br /> Jane Austen's novel weaves a group of several characters, balanced almost equally between men and women, into a web of romance in which the reader is led through various scenes and situations in a guessing game of who will end up with whom. Emma makes herself the prime mover of this group, but she is not as infallible a love broker as she would like to think. After she has successfully matched her childhood governess Miss Taylor with an affluent man named Weston, she turns her attention to the naive and impressionable Harriet Smith, for whom she has identified the young vicar Mr. Elton as a suitable beau. But then Elton declares his love for Emma, who of course is not interested in him, and...oh, what a mess. <br />  <br /> The plot thickens when a pretty girl named Jane Fairfax arrives in town to inspire Emma's curiosity and jealousy because she, unlike Harriet, is charming enough not to need Emma's assistance and tutelage. The main heartthrob among the women is Frank Churchill, actually Weston's son from a previous marriage, an impulsive and not totally honest young man whose amorous unpredictabilities shake the foundations of Emma's schemes. The man designed to be a traditional hero is George Knightley, sixteen years Emma's senior, who acts as Emma's moral anchor and monitors her matchmaking endeavors, gently cutting her down to size when her head gets a little too big, such as when she tells him that Robert Martin, a farmer, isn't of the proper class to be Harriet's husband.  <br />  <br /> Austen maintains the right narrative pace, giving her major characters just enough room to develop themselves plausibly through interactions with some colorful minor characters. Emma's father, the slow-on-the-uptake Mr. Woodhouse, a man of extreme sensitivity to gastronomical disorders and temperature fluctuations, is an innocuous but amiable fellow who appreciates his daughter's loyal devotion but is judiciously content to remain in the background of her life and activities. The Highbury seniors are represented by the elderly Mrs. Bates and her slightly less elderly daughter Miss Bates, who has a marvelous talent for prattling about trifles in which nobody else is interested. She can be outdone only by Miss Suckling, the annoying chatterbox Elton decides to marry after being jilted by Emma. <br />  <br /> Emma is not a bad or cruel person--she genuinely feels guilty about Harriet's continual romantic misfortunes and her own momentary sarcastic behavior towards Miss Bates. However, it cannot be denied that she's a snob whose goal is a Perfect Society with all the right ladies married to the right men, and to hell with all those other little people (the farmers, the servants, the unattractive, etc.) who don't fit into her master plan. But Austen herself admitted this much, showing that Emma is far from perfect herself and allowing her to learn a lesson in humility by the end of the novel, for which she is duly rewarded--the denouement is a little too neat, but of a style so familiar to us by now that &quot;Emma&quot; seems nearly two centuries ahead of its time. <br />  <br />

1565847032|5.0|It is a shame that Chomskey is not more widely known and read among non-intellectuals. One need not be an intellectual or deep into national or world politics to immediately grasp the fact that for the past 50 years, our foreign policy has led this nation into one bloody disaster after another. After reading this book, you will understand why a nation that bills itself as a \\"peace loving nation\\" finds itself embroiled in what has now become a continual state of war.
0788815490|3.0|Held my attention, as pretty much any grandiloquent romantic period piece would. With its --<br /><br />* Sumptuous shots of Venice and London where the plot carves its predictable isosceles love triangle.<br /><br />* Helena Carter's glowing presence which hides some lurid unlady-like thoughts.<br /><br />* Roache's probing eyes that burn with primal ferocity beneath wide-brim hats.<br /><br />* The tension in interpersonal dynamics, always poised to explode.<br /><br />Yet...for all its passionate splendour in Venitian gondolas and frilly costumes, the plot simply under-delivers in transcending its rather languid unraveling. The characters are all somehow left holding the bag at the end, an expression that quite aptly describes my own feelings as well.<br /><br />Were this to be on cable, I'd most likely be glued, if only for the benefit of my pheromones. But I doubt I'd be seen standing in line to purchase this sparsely featured DVD.

B000022TSW|1.0|Or perhaps that's a very gentle title for this crude, long-winded profane rant of a movie, with no semblance of a plot except for grating rhyme jigs every minute.<br /><br /> No, I am not a prude, far from it in fact, so I did not mind the egregiously dirty language. But hinging a caper \\"comedy\\" only on lowest denominator toilet humor, replete with vomit gags, for 2 hours, is idiotic at best and intolerable at worst. This South Park farce is both.<br /><br /> Couched in a puerile screwball story about a war between the U.S. and Canada is a self-serving message on the dangers of censorship. Among all the farting and four-letter words are musical numbers and Kenny's trip to hell after he fatally sets himself on fire while experimenting with lighting farts for a wager.<br /><br /> Are you still listening? Well, try not to, the film is utterly skippable by kids, teens, the easily offended, or anyone with any sense of taste or humor. Which is basically everyone, really. A collossal waste of time.

0671510991|5.0|Diplomacy by Henry Kissinger is a masterful survey of diplomacy and the two strains that have marked its American application:  realism, most associated with \\"Realpolitik\\" and in the United States, Theodore Roosevelt, and idealism, most associated with Woodrow Wilson.  These tow variants of diplomatic thinking have competed with each other over the years to capture the direction of American foreign policy.   <br /> <br />Realism focuses on a nations objective geopolitical strengths and resources and maintains that foreign policy decisions should be made in a calculating manner so as to enhance the raw power of a state.  Military power, control over vital resources and unilateral actions are the hallmarks of this approach.  Idealism asserts that the very heart of war is the concern over raw military power and the acquisition of control over vital resources.  Collaborative organizations, mutual security and multilateral action are the characteristics of this approach.   <br /> <br />The book focuses on the exceedingly long run up to the First World War.  This begins with the Concert of Europe at the end of the Napoleonic Wars and ends with the unification of Germany and the rise of the German Empire.  The Great Powers then abandon all of the shared security arrangements they had so meticulously marshaled for over 100 years and through themselves into war.  Kissinger does a remarkable job of showing how military decisions and preparedness outstrip the political ability to control the fate of nations.  Suddenly, nations find themselves locked into rigid and aggressive mobilization schedules and in war before the reality of the decision has been fully apprehended by the civilian leadership. <br /> <br />Kissinger then turns his focus to the Treaty of Versailles, the chaos of the interwar period, the rise of Nazism and the Second World War.  All of this to show how the Cold War began and how this period of increasing tension and hostility between the US and the Soviet Union colored the foreign policy decisions of the US and eventually enmeshed us in the Vietnam War.   <br /> <br />Finally, the end of the cold war and the rise of the \\"New World Order\\" is discussed.   As an aside, it is amazing to me that George H.W. Bush got so much grief from the black helicopter set when he used this term.  Some people assumed he was referring to some \\"end times\\" interpretation of scripture while those versed in the language of diplomacy understood he was referring to a new structure, with the demise of the Soviet Union, to the international system of power among nations.   <br /> <br />All in all this is an incredibly well written work; a broad and complex subject treated with the assurance of a dedicated student and masterful practitioner of the discipline.  Finally it is astounding how the errors, and travails of one generation of diplomats set up the conditions for war or peace for the next.  Indeed, one can trace back the antecedents of the cold war to the events in the Concert of Europe. <br /> <br />A long and satisfying read. <br /> <br />John C. McKee <br />
B000001ESF|4.0|Coming off a critically lamented album (Caress of Steel, 1975) and the accompanying &quot;Down the Tubes Tour&quot;, Rush decided to ignore what both the critics were saying about their pompous change of musical direction and what some fans were wanting, a return to their straight ahead rock sound. Instead, they turned out one of their greatest albums, 2112, which would become a trademark piece and a mainstay of their concert tours. <br />  <br /> Instead of the raw sound of 'Caress of Steel' we get a more polished venture. Instead of the disjointed 'Fountain of Lamneth' we get a 20 minute epic that is tight and fluid, both lyrically and musically. Side Two of the album can't compare to the epic 2112, but not much can. Here is how it breaks down: <br />  <br /> 2112 is split up into 7 parts (some segueing into each other), it tells the story of a man who discovers a guitar in an Ayn Randian world (an early influence of Neil) of hopeless, government-sactioned mundanity. What follows is a logical telling of events nicely laid out in both music and word. From the opening salvo of 'Overture', which, as the name states, wraps up most of the themes into a 4.5 minute package, on through the bombast of the closing 'Grand Finale', 2112 is unrelenting in scope and execution. The 'Temples of Syrinx' is appropriately menacing, whose priests act as a high council through Geddy's broadly captured vocals. 'Discovery' is a wonderfully concieved and played movement of, well, discovery and hope. 'Oracle', my personal favorite section, is a standout, with its rhythmically addicting poundage, and the saddening and raw 'Soliloquy' leads us into the end. All in all, a long form piece of rock that holds up with the best of them (Yes' Close to the Edge, Genesis' Suppers Ready, etc). <br />  <br /> A Passage to Bangkok is a sort of cult status song in Rush's catalogue. Not played very often live, it's an ode to the 70's herb of choice. Lyrically it's fun and inventive, musically it's cleverand memorable (especially Alex's lean guitar sound and Geddy's exceptional bass work). The best track on Side Two, even if it touchy subject matter is a matter of taste nowadays (no pun intended). <br />  <br /> The Twilight Zone is a bit cheesy lyrically, but musically it holds up quite well. It's a leaner and more sparse track than most on the album, which helps it to stand out. <br />  <br /> Lessons is a bit of a throwback to the earlier albums. More rock, less insight. Some great moving bass lines by Geddy, once again. <br />  <br /> Tears is the obligatory overly sentimental ballad, of which they had quite a few of in the 70's (they would later better the formula with tracks like 'Different Strings' and 'Entre Nous').  <br />  <br /> Something For Nothing is also another throwback. More straight ahead, more of Geddy screaming, raw guitars. A weak close to a monumental album. <br />  <br /> 2112 is essential listening of the 1970's and the rock genre in general. They would never better the 'rock opera', even with the even broader 'Hemispheres' in 1978.
B00007ELEL|3.0|During the 90's I had heard a little about this film but I never got a chance to check it out. Since I have become a massive DVD collector i decided to pick it up (...) to see what the hype was about.   The movie had some funny moments and it was a descent film but it makes sense why its only (...) and wasn't received well by critics.   Some films you enjoy because of the actors, the plot or the style.   This film is none of those, its only worth it for a few laughs.   Turturro was funny, Buscemi is always great but John Goodman and Jeff Bridges i dont think can hold my interest for too long.   The film and plot are descent (makes little sense-which is one reason its funny). I guess the problem is I am not a huge fan of John Goodman or Jeff Bridges. I dont despise them as actors, there are very few actors i dont enjoy, but they aren't enough to hold this film together. Maybe the hype or the anticipation through out the years made it a bit of a let down, and maybe i just dont like the two main characters too much. \\"THE DUDE\\".   Even though I bought it, i couldn't find myself wanting to watch it again any time soon.      The replay value for me is weak   Story isn't all that interesting   The main characters are interesting but the actors playing them aren't.   P.S. A quick shot of Julianne Moores breasts is always a plus, as she is one of the few attractive red-heads that I love.
B00005JMEW|5.0|I had never really given Tarantino a shot until this movie which is a sin in most obsessed-Tarantino fans' eyes but I have to say after watching this one I went back and completed my Tarantino education. <br /> <br />Kill Bill Vol. 1 is the first half of what is really one long movie cut in two. It centers on the story of The Bride, an assassin who is gunned down by her former boss and lover. Unfortunately for him and his Deadly Viper Assassination Squad she survives and goes on a revenge-seeking, blood squirting, samauri sword fighting rampage that leaves barely any one alive. <br /> <br />Uma Thurman gives a great performance as The Bride and is not a just a pretty girl kicking some major ass but also an emotional woman who has lost her baby determined to do justice. Lucy Lui, Darrel Hannah and David Carradine also give great performances. <br /> <br />This is not a movie for the faint of heart, that is for sure. There are limbs flying, blood squirting and gruesome killings that would make most people squirmish. But these scenes are done artfully with full attribute to the samaurai movies that inspired them. It makes the viewer appreciate Tarantino's filmaking abilities to the fullest. <br /> <br />When this movie is over it will definitely leave you ready to see Vol. 2. Don't worry, it comes out on DVD on August 6.
B000000H7I|5.0|Not that it is possible for Suffocation to ever produce a bad album, but this is easily their best. No question about it. Death metal band Suffocation was formed in New York in the early '90s, comprising vocalist Frank Mullen, guitarists Doug Cerrito and Terrance Hobbs, bassist Chris Richards, and drummer Mike Smith. The group's 1991 debut album, Effigy of the Forgotten, became quite influential in the grind/death metal community. Following an important, but often overlooked first album, Long Island, New York's Suffocation really broke through to the underground metal masses with their sophomore Effigy of the Forgotten in 1991. A truly devastating display of technical death metal bordering on grindcore, this incredibly influential release opened the doors for an entire generation of extreme metal miscreants, who, in retrospect, made it the prevalent template for East Coast metal in the '90s. Matching impossibly guttural vocals with a bottom-heavy guitar foundation spewed forth at blistering speed and unparalleled brutality, Effigy's overwhelming, claustrophobic, and, well, suffocating rush, belies a surprisingly developed and, dare I say, 'sophisticated' sense of songwriting. Oh and the brutallity and heaviness has rarely been topped, but only by a mere few...ala Crimson Thorn, Disencumbrance/Detrimental, and Vomitorial Corpulence. Crushing examples like the title track, &quot;Infecting the Crypts,&quot; and the masterful &quot;Seeds of the Suffering&quot; probably frightened many unprepared listeners with their unapologetically blunt approach.Suffocation's gradual rise to prominence proves that even more listeners hung in there long enough to learn to appreciate the attention to detail and the hours of fascinating discovery to be found in the band's maniacally complex rhythms and lead and rhythm guitar acrobatics and not to mention the technicallity. NOT FOR THE WEAK OF HEART. An absolute must have for all metalheads. SUFFOCATION!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005J6UP|4.0|The Goonies is one of my all-time favorite movies from when I was a kid in the '80s. Honestly, what 10 year old wouldn't want to be a Goonie, running around your neighborhood looking for lost treasure and trying to escape from the Fratelli gang who are after you and your treasure?  <br /> <br />This DVD is a pretty good one when it comes to feaurettes and extras. There is an outtake montage scene which is  not nearly long enough but that is a negative I find on a lot of DVDs. The Cyndi Lauper music video could have definitely been left out but the extra scenes and the commentary more than make up for it. <br /> <br />This is a rare look at the early career of Sean Astin as well, who has gone on to star in Rudy and The Lord of the Rings trilogy. He has said that he has very fond memories of making this movie (his first) and it is no wonder. Being on a set with a bunch of other kids with that great pirate ship and waterfall to go down, who wouldn't. <br /> <br />I recommend this DVD to anyone who is looking for a little adventure and a little fun. This is a movie that's been around a while which attests to its staying power. After all Goonies never say die!
B00003CXCT|3.0|It's official: there are even more changes being done to the trilogy. Old Georgie's at the computers again, and this time his corrections are even more drastic than before. Nobody liked the changes made for the Special Edition 1997 release of Star Wars, and nobody's gonna like this one's either. Call it a Super Deluxe Temporary 2004 Limited Edition DVD Version 1.2 Star Wars, if you will. Whether or not fans appreciate this continuous tampering of the films, as well as having to buy release after release, is debatable. But who can appreciate the removal of Anakin Skywalker's ghost in Jedi in place of a younger Hayden Chrissomething's? Or replacing Boba Fett's voice in Empire with the Australian guy in the new one? Or (worst of all) including Naboo and the Gungans in the victory celebration, one of whom is compelled to exclaim &quot;Wesa free&quot;. I have seen the photos with my own eyes, and those compelled to disbelieve will be shocked come September. And Greedo still shoots first. Seriously. And since Lucas feels that every time he has a bright idea about the movie he can make the &quot;official&quot; change permanently, there will be no option to watch the original versions. Take it or leave it, this is the new Star Wars, and it's here to stay. Until George changes his mind again.
B0001ENYKS|4.0|As a recent newcomer (I will admit it) to the indie rock scene, when I first listen to this CD I thought it was a good addition to this year's music. I listened to it endlessly, enjoying the rhythmic beats of such songs as &quot;Darts of Pleasure&quot;, &quot;40'&quot; and even their single &quot;Take Me Out&quot;.  <br />  <br /> Imagine my surprise when I turned on VH1 to find that their video for the above-mentioned video was in VH1's Top Twenty Countdown. Was this the indie end for Franz Ferdinand? Some seemed to think so. But maybe not. <br />  <br /> If you are looking for a solid indie CD I would suggest looking elsewhere (to Interpol or The Shins ) but if you are looking for a good semi-pop with indie influence album look no further.
B000063DI9|5.0|Iron Maiden are one of the few bands I know that always maintain their signature sound on every one of their albums, and at the same time can make an album that doesn't sound like any of their others.  7th Son is probably the best example of this.  It's obviously Maiden, but it's the only album in their discography that sounds the way it does.  And the album is kick-you-square-in-the-butt fantastic.  Many fans say this is one of Maiden's best, and the last truly great album the band put out.  It's not hard to see why they think that.  Of course I happen to like the albums after this one, but that's another story.  7th Son is very epic sounding with a concept running throughout all the songs.  In a bizarre way I find this album soothingly mellow if I'm in the right mood.  But make no mistake about it, your reaction to this great album will anything but mellow.
B00008EY65|1.0|Mexican horror master Guillermo del Toro strikes out this this noisy, superficial action film about open portals to hell, paranormal superheroes and big, ugly monsters with tentacles. Mostly, &quot;Hellboy&quot; exists to showcase proficient special effects and an explosive climax similar to every other action film. I was bored by it all.
B00024BHTC|5.0|Okay, i have read all the reviews here on the new NIGHTWISH CD ONCE. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion that is what makes the human race so unique, it is also what makes NIGHTWISH so unique. Their ability to explore the unexplored places for metal and to formulate a CD like ONCE. <br /> Tuomas Holopainen is undoubtley the greates songwriter/arranger in metal music today. This CD proves it. Tarja Turunen what can i say, not only is she beautiful, but has the voice of an angel, and on ONCE she explores with confidence areas of her vocal ability to the fullest. Now for Marco Hietala, the worlds best bass player and a voice that compliments Tarja, not overpowers her ROCK ON MARCO. Jukka Nevalainen, who is in a league of his own, there is no drummer today who can hold a candle to him. Emppu Vurinen, the most underrated guitarist in the world today, he can do things with a guitar others only wish they could do. Though not flashy just solid. Now the best songs from ONCE are Creek Mary's Blood, and Dead Garden. The use of Mr. John Twohawks was a stroke of brilliance, go to his website and read the reviews of NIGHTWISH if you want honest opinions. The production on this CD is the best i have every heard. So these so called metal lovers who berate NIGHTWISH they need to get a life, come out from under their rock and then listen to all types of metal before they say the things they do. IF you ever get a chance to see NIGHTWISH in concert you are in for the biggest thrill of you life, they will blow you away and change you preception of what a concert should be. Enought said NIGHTWISH ROCKS and will go down in history as one of the greatest Metal bands of all times.
B00008EY65|2.0|This movie's target audience is 14-year-old boys. There's no question about that. It's packed with special effects, weird characters and plenty of over-the-top action. It's also packed with corny dialog, mediocre acting, and just about every action movie cliche you could think of. It could easily be called the Masters of the Universe of the 21st century. Lots of window dressing and not much else. Oh, and what's with the fey fish-man? Very disturbing. Rent before you buy.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Do you want to see Jimmy Smits sitting in a comfy chair on Alderaan moments before the Death Star blows it up?  <br />  <br /> Do you want to settle for altered lines from Han and Luke and even Obi-Wan?  <br />  <br /> I mean there is a big difference in character when Han says --It's ok, i can see a lot better now-- than his original --Trust me!-- remark. and even Luke's lame --You're lucky you don't taste very good.-- is better than --You're lucky you are made out of metal.-- <br />  <br /> What about the horrible new Celebration Flute Song at the end of Jedi, that replaces the once loved Ewok Celebration song...can you live with that? Do i care what things might have looked like on Coruscant after the second Death Star was blown up? no, i really don't. because let's face it, that wouldn't be enough to send the whole planet into an uproar of celebration...where they all rebels? so where is the Imperial presence George? <br />  <br /> i personally cannot bear to watch some cheesy CG ronto throw Jawas all around. my teeth grind audibly when i see the very poor CG representation of Jabba. He's intimidated by Han in A New Hope then in Jedi we are supposed to believe the Han is intimidated by him? what the heck gives here George? <br />  <br /> i will not be supporting this remedial collection on DVD. i would rather simply ignore it's existence and enjoy my old THX Remastered Trilogy VHS tapes. heck i'm even considering buying a LD machine and tracking it down on that. Anything will beat this mockery of the Star Wars universe. <br />  <br /> some of us care that George Lucas is off his rocker and simply trying to exert his power over the universe he created....but old man, sometimes you must let your creations grow on their own. the war is over...your empire has fallen, let the new Rebellion take over and bring your injustices to a halt. <br />  <br /> I care that Greedo shot first, and frankly so should you!
B0002BO0AS|5.0|Unearth truely has put Massachusetts on the map, This five piece proves that elements of brutality, beauty, and power can co-exist on the same cd. Much Props to Adam D. from Killswitch Engage for producing such an awesome CD. The vocalist Trevor has obviously done work to better his voice for this outing. My favorite song on the CD has to be Zombie Apocalypse.If you like The Oncoming Storm be sure to pick up the Endless EP. Unearth is coming to destroy your town with The Oncoming Storm.
B00003CXCT|1.0|This isn't really a review so much as a mini-proclamation. I won't be buying this DVD set. I love the original trilogy and, for me, the running changes add nothing to my enjoyment of it. In fact, they stick out so much that I find I cannot watch the film for being distracted by the changes. So, buy it if you must. Heck, I even hope some of you enjoy it. Me? I won't drop another dime into the Lucas Film vault. Not until the original Original Trilogy, warts and all, is released.
078681859X|5.0|I thought this book was exciting. I enjoyed getting to hear parts of the same story, told by two different things, so you got to get different views. I think people of all ages can enjoy this book. It is full of different emotions, sadness, happiness, humor, enjoyment. I thought this book is a great example of how things should be. In some books it explains things in the back, then you have to keep turning the pages back and forth. But in this book the explanations are at the bottom of the page. Which makes it very much more enjoyable. If you haven't read this book, I would reccomend it. I would also reccomend the book Eragon by: Christopher Paolini, and Abarat by: Clive Barker. Those are two great books which I am sure you will enjoy. If you need any help in finding books, send me an e-mail at DolphinLvr1991@cs.com. I will try my best to answer any questions
B0002EXH5O|5.0|lets get seomthing straight, dave had to re-record the vocals for Take No PRisoners and Five Magics because original tapes that contained the vocal tracks were gone. stop complaining. <br /> <br />the demos are a real gem as well, you can hear what Rust In Peace would have sounded like had Chris Poland not been kicked out of the band, awesome, awesome music!
0920236162|5.0|If you are looking for a book with a smart heroine with common sense who doesn't just wait for her prince to save her, you will have trouble beating Elizabeth, the Paper Bag princess. In this story Elizabeth is betrothed to a prince named Ronald. When a dragon comes along and smashes her castle, burns her clothes and carries off Ronald, Elizabeth doesn't just sit crying in the ashes, but decides to go save her love Ronald. Sadly all she can find to wear is a paper bag, so she dons that and follows the trail of burnt forests and horses bones left in the dragon's wake. Through several tricks Elizabeth manages to outwit the dragon and incapacitate him. Ronald however, doesn't seem to appreciate her efforts. His warm welcome to Elizabeth goes something like this: \\"Elizabeth, you are a mess! You smell like ashes, your hair is all tangled and you are wearing a dirty old paper bag. Come back when you are dressed like a real princess.\\" What makes this book one of the best books written is Elizabeth's response \\"Ronald, your clothes are really pretty and your hair is very neat. You look like a real prince, but you are a bum.\\"<br /><br />The illustrations are wonderful. They are bright, colorful, bold and expressive. The dragon is exactly as I would imagine a dragon to look like. The story is told in a very straightforward, simple manner that endears it to me.<br /><br />Loggie-log-log-log
B0002EXH54|5.0|when i heard this, its so amazing. the boosted bass, drums and now you can even hear the guitar solos *begins drooling again*
B000001Y16|5.0|This is a classic must-have album,  <br />it has classic cuts like:Me And my girlfriend, To Live and die in la, ect.  <br />which makes this album as classic as it is, so buy infuence u to buy it if u don't own it.
B0002EXH4A|5.0|this album is pure thrash, and now that dave has remixed/remastered it all the reverb that was drowning the instruments is GONE!!! :) its so amazing it aint even funny. buy this. its NOW the best megadeth cd ever.
B00005AQE8|5.0|This album is classic. Songs like Got My Mind Made up, all about u, and how do u want it, make this album a must have. If you want a collection all classic production, then this album is for u.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|godsmack is one of my favorite bands. i own all of their albums except the OTHER SIDE. but, they dont have anything really original, and when they put out album after album, they never really change at all. this is both good and bad. this is good because i hate it when my favorite bands change (metallica). this is bad because sometimes you need to bring soemthing new to the table, not let all of your songs sound the same. this was, at a time, my favorite album and i couldnt stop listening to it. this was a mistake. i almsot never listen to it anymore but ill give it five stars on the quality of the album. bottom line: good but dont overplay it.
B000002540|5.0|In a darkened room, set up your speakers on the floor about four feet apart. Now, lay down with your head on a pillow positioned midway between your speakers. I'm serious! Crank up Last Days of May (without making your ears bleed) and close your eyes.      Now, picture white clad Buck Dharma, bathed in blue light, standing alone in a smoky spotlight beam. A heady brew of pot and perfume permeates the air. Buck looks down as you strain against the crowd that yearns for your spot on the barrier, longing to worship at his feet. He smiles at you with his infectious grin and nods knowingly as he effortlesly produces the most unearthly, mournful wails ever to emanate from a guitar. You stare in disbelief and a shiver comes over you as if it was you in that ill-fated back seat, with your life-blood flowing and your mispent life slipping away before your eyes. The crush fades as the crowd becomes mesmerized. Lighters begin to pierce the darkness like stars on a moonless night. Someone nearby lets out a shrill whistle. Buck turns and your ears buzz with a harmonic ringing, like a pickup on Buck's guitar. The solo ends with a flourish, the lights come up and he joins Eric Bloom, clad in sunglasses and a theatrical black cape, as they bring the song to a finish. The spell is broken and the air is forced from your lungs as the crowd surges forward, pinning you against the barrier. You could die a happy man now. You have witnessed one of the greatest live songs ever recorded.     This album captures Blue Oyster Cult's musical genius and raw power like lightning in a bottle. At the time this was recorded, the sound level at a BOC concert could probably be measured on a seismograph!     Unlike most live albums, many of the songs here are actually better than the studio versions. Last Days of May compared to the studio version is like The Red and the Black compared to I'm on the Lamb: not even close. Subhuman is unbelievable! Buck flat out wails and Allen plays the Hammond like a six-string axe. Seven Screaming Dizbusters just keeps building and building to a diz-busting climax. Harvester of Eyes is transformed into a crunchy boogie that is far more enjoyable than the already good studio version.     The CD is not without its faults such as bad production, that annoying screech between two tracks, the repeat of a portion of Buck's Boogie as a jam at the end of Maserati GT and of course, several conspicuously absent classics. Despite this, it still ranks as one of, if not THE greatest live album in rock history.     I for one would not mind if this album was remastered, if for no other reason than to get rid of that awful screech. As an owner of a vinyl copy as well, I am annoyed by the crossover added to the CD to meld four album sides into one
B000000OSG|5.0|i picked up UYU 1 and 2 a little while ago and i was blown away. together, they were the most beautiful, hard, rockin album i had ever heard. UYU 2 starts off with CIVIL WAR, the best song on the album, starts as a nice ballad, and then switches to a hard rock classic. 14 YEARS and YESTERDAYS are two nice ballads, along with KNOCKIN ON HEAVENS DOOR. GET IN THE RING makes me laugh and it rocks pretty hard even though it may have taken Axl all of five minutes to write the lyrics. SHOTGUN BLUES is just a little weird, still a cool song, and BREAKDOWN is another nice ballad. the album continues in this pattern, until the final track, MY WORLD. its a good thing this song is only a minute and a half, this is just pointless, i dont know why the hell Axl had to put this on the album it makes no sense and none of the other bandmembers are in it. o well you cant win em all. even still, this album along with 1 is andisputable masterpiece, even if you dont like the direction Axl wanted to take away from APPETITE.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|This movie, for all that's been said about it, just goes to show you that it's not your talent that matters but who you are related to.  <br /> I gave Coppola another chance after Virgin Suicides and have decided to give up on her after seeing Translation.  <br /> This movie was pointless, uneventful and boring. This is the only movie I can honestly say is better understood when fast forwarding through the whole thing.  <br /> HORRIBLE!!  <br /> For Coppola: stick to being behind the camera because your stories are worse than reading Lillian Vernon catalogues while on the toilet.
B000002JS6|5.0|im a little bit younger im only 14, so i have yet to be educated in real rock, but when i heard YOU SHOOK ME ALL NIGHT LONG on the radio, i had a feeling that was it. i went out and bought BACK IN BLACK and i loved every bit of it. <br /> <br />HELLS BELLS- 8/10 this song kind of annoys me, but the guitars and lyrics are cool <br /> <br />SHOOT TO THRILL- 10/10 this song just plain rocks, classic hard rock <br /> <br />WHAT DO YOU DO FOR MONEY HONEY- 10/10 another great rock song <br /> <br />GIVIN THE DOG A BONE- 7/10 i dont kno, this song jsut gets kind of repetitive and gets old after a while <br /> <br />LET ME PUT MY LOVE INTO YOU- 7/10 i just dont like this song, its just too slow, but not slow enough to be a ballad <br /> <br />BACK IN BLACK- 15/10 YEA HERE WE GO!!! AWESOME GUITAR SOLO, COOL LYRICS, JSUT A POWER PACK ALL THE WAY <br /> <br />YOU SHOOK ME ALL NIGHT LONG- 10/10 the whole reason i bought the album, never gets old <br /> <br />HAVE A DRINK ON ME- 8/10 eh, just ok <br /> <br />SHAKE A LEG- 9/10 repetitive, but still a cool song <br /> <br />ROCK AND ROLL AINT NOISE POLLUTION- 10/10 nice way to finish off the album, slow cool song <br /> <br />to sum it up, this is classic hard rock, and if your a rock fan this needs to be in your collection
B00006879E|5.0|I love this band. Too bad many of us fans didnt hear about them sooner, when they first released &quot;Songs About Jane.&quot; I absolutely LOVE his voice! I am excited about going to see them with John Mayer, I know they are going to rock! I definately recommend this album to all.
B000000OSE|5.0|Ok ive edited this review and i originally sed this was my fav album which i take back. both I and II are equally as good, I has more hard rock songs, and II has more strange ballads. RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO HELL, a good old fashioned kick ass rock song, opens the album. from there on it switches between ballad and hard rock, until NOVEMBER RAIN, the greatest song on the album. THE GARDEN just doesnt do anything for me, i usually skip it. GARDEN OF EDEN is an awesome, very fast paced song, and from there on is followed up by more hard rock songs, and then it gets to COMA. i dont really understand this song, it sounds cool so ill listen to it, but its just kind of weird, not to mention that its 10 minutes long. anyway, USE YOUR ILLUSION I along with II is my favorite album ever, whether your a GNR fan, a hard rock fan, a classic rock fan, whatever youre looking for GNR has it in this unbelievable 80 minute masterpiece.
B00005QY5Y|4.0|I grew up on country music. In fact, it was practically the only music that I listened to until I was about 11. I remember the moment I discovered the world of rock through Nirvana (as so many young men of my generation did) that I decided country music was conservative, cheesy, and boring. I even scoffed at CCR and Bob Dylan for the longest time until I started listening closer to the words, chord choices, and tone of voice and realized that sometimes more can be said with a few simple chords and knowing your way around them than with high-end, reverberating guitar noises and confrontational distortion. <br /> Ryan Adams is no Bob Dylan. (How many people are?) Instead of a city boy infatuated with rural America, Adams sounds more like a country artist with a city obsession and this is probably what makes him so damn pleasurable to me. Case in point: The very first track on the album, a country-rock anthem that wouldn't sound out of place on early 90s country radio next to Garth Brooks, is a nostalgia piece about love in the Big City. As much as I love the open road sound of the rhythm guitar throughout, the best part of this particular song is when it builds to a climax with a jazzy saxophone interlude. <br /> Experimentation with different instruments in his songs (along with pop sensibility) is Ryan's secret to catching your ears. \\"Firecracker\\" starts off with a harmonica riff that trades off with guitar-twanged pop through the duration of the song. Skipping to arguably the best song on the album, \\"La Cienega Just Smiled\\" a subtly painful ballad about (surprise!) a relationship with a chick and the problems that go along with them. Adam's voice, lyrics, and delicate melody will all leave you feeling wonderfully cleansed and miserable at the same time somehow when it ends. <br /> Other notable tracks on this album are: Somehow, Someday; Harder Now That It's Over; and Goodnight, Hollywood Blvd which closes the album on a bittersweet note after two okay-ish more nuanced numbers. Tracks Nobody Girl and Sylvia Plath are overly long and terrible respectively. <br /> On a shallow endnote, the guy has a great sense of humor. In the liner notes he thanks both \\"the Grateful Dead and Black Flag at the same time\\" and then \\"MEG WHITE for saving Rock n Roll,\\" probably a tongue-in-cheek reference to the embarrassing number of magazines that have crowned the lovable Stripes as \\"rock saviors\\". Ha Ha. Yeah! That's cool... In any case, this is one of the most diversified and enjoyable alt-country albums that I've heard and I'm more of a noise/space rock fan; therefore, it's not even really in my genre. Take that for what it's worth. <br />
B000002H2H|5.0|the album that really introduced me to classic heavy metal, always will be a favorite of mine.    fight fire with fire- 10/10 kick ass song with classy intro followed by great headbanging solo.    ride the lightning- 10/10 great opening guitar riff, some alright lyrics, a classic metal song    for whom the bell tolls- 10/10 great song, timeless metal anthem, at least vocal wise, theres nothing much on guitar here    fade to black- 10/10 best song on the album by a long shot, one of the greatest solos and greatest lyrics ever written    Trapped under ice- 10/10 fastest paced song on the album, some good lyrics and great musicianship    escape- 8/10 good tune at first, but doesnt hold up after a couple listens    creeping death- 10/10 another timeless metal anthem that this record managed to spawnm, awesome song but the lyrics are a bit cheesy    the call of ktulu- 9/10 in my opinion ORION is a better instrumental, but this has some good stuff
1400032717|4.0|This is a depiction of the world through the eyes of an autistic 15-year-old, Christopher Boone. Christopher's prose is simple and terse. He bluntly expresses his distaste for metaphors because to him metaphors are nothing more than sources for confusion. As a result the book is scant in adjectives, adverbs, and verbs, anything that might invite ambiguity. However you should not allow this simplicity in presentation fool you. Christopher's is a sophisticated mind -- he would be able to explain to you things varying from the characteristics of black holes to the exact scholastic names of obscure animal species (unusual nouns are abundant). What he abhors is the uncertain, the un-orderly. He requires definite algorithms to perform even the most basic of tasks, like finding a way to his mother's new flat in London. <br /> <br />The breadth of emotion the author conveys through these simple sentences is astounding. For instance, was it not simple, abstract grievance Christopher felt when he encountered difficulties, discovered the truth about his parents? Readers are given the ultimate freedom to interpret, yet what we feel is nothing less than concrete. Deeply empathetic, and a well-deserving winner of the 2004 Whitbread prize in my humble opinion.
B00005JLSE|3.0|I'm afraid I have to dissent somewhat from the gushing reviews preceding this.  <br /> <br />Certainly, there's plenty to admire in Chicago. The song-and-dance numbers are staged with verve and imagination. You get Kander and Ebb's good, though not great, score. (The sound recording has marvelous presence, especially if you have the equipment to play back the DTS version.)  <br /> <br />You get one and a half superlative performances in the lead roles. Who ever would have thought Catherine Zeta-Jones had it in her to be a mesmerizing singer and dancer? A very pleasing revelation. <br /> <br />Renee Zellweger continually brings up a conflict for me: she's adorable, obviously talented ... and seems to need very little encouragement to over-torque every expression and gesture. I'm sure Rob Marshall encouraged her to play broadly, in keeping with his own directorial style, and the net effect is just too much of a caricature. But she, too, is a knockout in the musical and terpsichorean department. The big climactic scene when Zeta-Jones and Zellweger perform a duet is the most electrifying thing of its kind I've ever seen. <br /> <br />So why don't I give Chicago a rave? <br /> <br />First, there is the preening, simpering embarrasment that is Richard Gere, who has ruined more movies than I care to remember. He can't ruin this one, but it's a close call. Again, I'm sure the director didn't ask him for subtlety, but even farce takes some discipline. (Some would say it takes more discipline than any other form of acting.) Gere is such a clumsy actor that he's painful to watch. Maybe the ladies (or guys, if so inclined) who think he's dishy won't care. <br /> <br />But the overall problem, for me, is a matter of tone. It's set in the '20s, but nothing about it (especially the dialogue) authentically evokes the time, or, I suspect, the place.  <br /> <br />Worse, the film is so relentlessly cynical and mean-spirited that, even when it's impressive, you can't shake off the feeling that the drink has been spiked with something poisonous. Chicago just keeps punching you out, showing you what a sucker you are for caring for any of these people, or for anyone in the world.  <br /> <br />Musicals don't have to be lollipops, and some of the best have darker shadings. Rodgers and Hammerstein's Oklahoma! mixes serious emotions with its flamboyant music and choreographic artistry, for instance. Chicago, for all its energy and compelling vitality, is monomaniacal  -- a steely, misanthropic supershow.   <br /> <br />
0553062182|3.0|When I read the first two chapters of this book, I felt that I was an HSP and this is the book right for me. However, when I read further, I was confused about the different methods that the author recommended, such as &quot;baby talk&quot; for adults, networking is not for HSP, etc. I don't think these ideas will give any positive impact on someone's life. But I do agree with the author that HSPs need sufficient rest, but so do non HSPs. At least, everybody needs to take good care of oneself. And be bold to pursue one's dream. Even if you are sensitive, it doesn't mean that someone will overprotect you.
B000286S8S|2.0|I read the track listing when I bought this. Its missing a few key songs from their history. Take Your Whiskey Home, Ice Cream Man and my favorite So This Is Love. The last tune should have made this collection. I know Jump is famous, but I didn't like the song when it was first released and still don't till this day. Why two stars? The new songs, except for the second one, are terribly grungy. Weak and the production sounds like mud. I've waited how long to hear some good new material from these guys (since at least the time when Balance came out) You're better off spending your money on the remasters themselves. I see them often at places for 8.99 and 10.99. Its worth having the other tracks that are missing here. And Amazon, go back and redo your track listing, its out of order and missing the new songs which follow Eruption on the CD. That's another thing, Eruption and You Really Got Me go hand in hand. They've turned into Kiss, putting out one greatest hits album and live album after another, just to make a buck and tour off their oldies. Pretty soon, we'll see Van Halen playing the local summer festivals for $5.00 a ticket and wander, what happened to the greatest guitarist in the world. Sad, very sad. However, if you don't have the cash to get all the old CDs or don't have the last best of album Vol 1, then this is a good collection of the radio hits. (that at least earned the second star) Let's hope that when Gary Cherone gets back together with Extreme (and it is happening), that they produce a stellar CD that picks up where III Sides left off, and not just some Jump-On-The-Grunge-Alternative-Bandwagon, like Punchline was. You want to listen to someone who still rocks and write some killer new stuff? Go get a Jeff Scott Soto CD or his other band Talismen, pick up their last release Cats And Dogs, now that album is 5 stars, hands down. Thanks for listening.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|Even though the expression may be immeasurably clich&eacute;, I firmly believe that, at this point, you have been living under a rock if you haven't heard \\"Take me out,\\" Franz Ferdinand's breakthrough single that has been garnering the band so much media attention.  Like nearly everybody else, that song was my first exposure to the band, and (perhaps not like nearly everybody else) was very impressed with it.  It grew on me like a fungus, but when I starting thinking about picking up the album itself, I feared that it would be essentially built around that single and maybe one or two others, but mostly consist of average filler songs displaying future potential but no immediate substance.  To put it plainly: I was wrong.<br /><br />The band's eponymous debut LP is one of 2004's best releases so far, especially by a fairly straight-up rock band.  Though Strokes comparisons are frequent, there is nothing you hate about the Strokes (i.e. total lack of energy/stage presence, unabashed VU worship, false image, etc.) present on this record.  The only real point of comparison between the two bands is that they're both incredible songsmiths who can come up with hooks and melodies that you'll take to your grave.  The difference is that Franz Ferdinand do it with style and flair.<br /><br />The album's opener, \\"Jacqueline,\\" starts with quiet, acoustic strums and reflective storytelling, and abruptly morphs into uptempo, energetic guitar rock with lyrics like, \\"I'm so drunk/ I don't mind if you kill me.\\"  Following the first track is \\"Tell her tonight,\\" which has got to be the best disco rock stalker anthem ever.  Then there is, of course, \\"Take me out,\\" which, now I've become more familiar with the rest of the album doesn't really feel like one of its stronger points.  It's still a great song, especially considering its popularity, but it doesn't shine as brightly as most of the other songs on this album, especially highlights such as the yearning, almost plaintive \\"Auf Achse,\\" the snotty, punky \\"Cheating on you,\\" and the bouncy \\"The dark of the matinee.\\"<br /><br />The album's finest moment, however, is \\"This fire\\": the catchiest, most danceable and energetic song on the album.  It cycles through periods of tame, subdued verses into its anthemic, unstoppable chorus (\\"This fire is outta control/ I'm gonna burn this city/ Burn this city\\"), and eventually builds up to its own mini-climax of sorts.<br /><br />Bottom line: This Scottish rock group has created an immensely enjoyable, danceable, hook-laden record that will appeal to almost any fan of rock music.the snotty, punky \\"Cheating on you,\\" and the bouncy \\"The dark of the matinee.\\" <br /> <br />The album's finest moment, however, is \\"This fire\\": the catchiest, most danceable and energetic song on the album.

B00003CXA3|5.0|Both Oscars won by Hackman were for portraying brutal & arrogant individuals.  Popeye Doyle is the persona of the 70's cop, ruthless, determined, bold.  It was a well made film that I love watching over and over again.  Many of the scenes were done in my old Brooklyn neighborhood, especially the begining scene which I so remember being in (Bedford-Stuyvesant).  It is New York through and through.
0812548094|1.0|Well, I read the first in this series years ago, and tried reading this one right afterwards.  I started and was disgusted with it.  I for one do not like the neverending list of baddies that suddenly crop up in the beginning of each new book.  The characters seem fairly stupid to me, and even though they have all these powers and gifts, they cant seem to ever use them to advantage.  Also there are so many things ripped from other recent fantasy, very blatantly I might add(a silver collar that controls magic with no visible clasp... um is it just me or is that a direct rip off of the collar thing in Wheel of Time?) I just put it down in disgust after a few hundred pages, but thats just me.  I know fantasy 'borrows' often one from another, but this is just copying.  etc etc, I dont really see how so many people rate it so well, Proceed with Caution!
B00005JLYW|3.0|Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle...now this was one interesting movie.  I knew going into this thing that it wasn't going to be award winning material at the Academy, but I braced myself and tried to enjoy the time.  The movie was sort of a feature length music video.  Some of the effects and stunts were so over the top, and so obviously computer generated that at times I wanted to vomit, and at times I couldn't have laughed harder.  The three girls were great in the movie though, you can tell they were all just having a blast, which really helps the movie out. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a pretty fun movie that does cross the line sometimes with the absurd, but if you don't stop to laugh and enjoy yourself with some of the dance sequences, then this is definately not the movie for you.

B00024BHTC|4.0|Alright kiddies, listen up. That got your attention, eh? Nightwish are not the ultimate in metal, rock or anything else - but they ARE very good. Their songwriting lyric-wise suffers very poorly in translation, or is at best poor new-agey tripe, but they have a sound that most rock bands around now would (or at least should) kill for. The first song I heard by them was End of All Hope from Century Child, and it got my attention across a very crowded, noisy room - they provide an almost gut-wrenching surge of power when they cut loose, and if there's better driving music out there I haven't heard it. The fact that other bands have tried to mix a more symphonic sound with metal noise and haven't come close to the tight, layered sound that Nightwish achieve enhances, rather than detracts from, their potential. Get them a good lyricist to match that sound, and you have an indispensable band. Want to get a feel for them? Listen to &quot;Dark Chest of Wonders&quot; from this and concentrate on the sound, not the words. You'll get it. With more albums like this, more will....
B00004T8RK|4.0|This album gets a bad rap from many PJ fans... All I have to say is that any album coming after Yeild(imo their masterpiece) was bound to get mixed feelings.  This was, however, the first PJ album where there more than a couple of songs I did not like.  This album has some great slow songs.  Light Years and Thin Air are fantastic songs. Another upside to this album is that there are no crappy talking tracks in which Vedder just talks behind some wierd music. Their faster songs though are flat and boring. If you combine these slow songs with the better fast songs on Riot Act you have a great collection of songs... Just not good overall albums.  Pearl Jam has made its best albums when they have combined strong and catchy fast songs with slow and beautiful ballads.  If you want those kinds of complete albums get Vitalogy and Yeild.  If you want mostly fast, get VS. Only after getting these would I ever think about looking at these albums.
B00005JN2F|4.0|This has been a surprisingly good summer for sequels as a greater than usual number of them equal or surpass their originals (Spider-Man, Shrek, Harry Potter) and now Bourne Supremacy can be added to that list.  The action does not slow down which is a wise move as it never allows the viewer to think about the holes in the plot or to dwell on the rather too obvious solutions and twists.  Matt Damon carries the movie with ease showing himself to be an actor of great charisma with little visible effort.  Joan Allen is a treat in a performace so brittle it almost threatens to shatter, but never does, at many points.  Julia Stiles has a little more to do this time around but still feels wasted in a small, underwritten part.  But it is the action that holds this movie together and makes it worth a viewing.   A good summer movie, if not a classic.
055357342X|5.0|A month later, I finally finish this epic fantasy novel. It is a very long book, but I love long novels. It is the third book in the series and it continues to be amazing. If you've never read George R.R. Martin I highly recommend him and this series. The book had me facinated from the very beginning and it seemed like every chapter brought yet another amazing twist that I didn't see coming. The book ends on a major cliff hanger and has me ready to scream because I want to read the next book now.

B00027JYLC|5.0|For years I had heard about the legendary Tod Browning film &quot;Freaks&quot; that so upset audiences it was banned in Boston and Great Britain. I had read the short story &quot;Spurs&quot; on which it was based and when the film was finally screened on campus I talked my roommate into going with me. Most of the people sitting around us knew nothing about the film and when I told them about it everybody started to get nervous. Then the film began...and we all loved it! My roommate and I both had crushes on Daisy Earles who plays Frieda in the film, opposite her brother Harry as Hans (for years I thought they were really husband and wife; my mistake).<br /><br /> The story is quite simple: Hans and Frieda are a pair of midgets in love, but Hans thinks that Cleopatra (Olga Baclanova) the bareback rider is beautiful. Cleopatra plays with Hans' affections until she learns he has money. Over the objections of her boyfriend, Hercules (Henry Victor) the freak show strongman, she accepts Hans' proposal. During the wedding feast when the freaks accept her into their ranks, she makes it clear how much she despises them all. But when Hans starts to become ill because of the poison she is feeding him, the freaks decide it is time to take matters into their own hands. The film's climax, when the freaks chase Cleopatra and Hercules during a rainstorm, is truly chilling, although Cleopatra's final fate is as unreal as it is ironic and was supposed to be even worse. But the scene of Hercules singing soprano in Madame Tetralini's new sideshow because he had been castrated was found to be too intense for early audiences and was cut.<br /><br /> All Browning really did to terrify audience was to include real freaks in his film, such as Daisy and Violet Hilton the Siamese Twins, Schlitze the Pinhead Girl, Josephine Joseph the Half-Woman/Half-Man, Johnny Eck the Half Boy, Frances O'Connor the Turtle Girl, Peter Robinson the Living Human Skeleton, Olga Roderick the Bearded Lady, Koo Koo the Bird Girl, Martha Morris the Armless Wonder, and Randion the Living Torso, who rolls his own cigarettes despite having neither arms nor legs. The original short story &quot;Spurs&quot; by Tod Robbins had a midget falling for a bareback rider who marries him for his money and at their wedding feast puts her husband on her shoulders and boasts that she will carry him across France. With the aid of his large, angry dog he forces her to do just that. Browning's film expands the scope of the story into something more complex and much more satisfying.<br /><br /> However, the film clearly portrays the &quot;Freaks&quot; with dignity. As Madame Tetrallini (Rose Dione) tells someone, &quot;These are all God's children.&quot; The true monsters in this film are the &quot;normal&quot; human beings, who receive their just desserts. But when &quot;Freaks&quot; was relased it was banned in the United Kingdom for thirty years (and is still banned in Sweden). During that period Browning was blackballed in Hollywood. He had promised MGM the ultimate scary movie and given the reaction you have to conclude that he delivered. The film was originally intended to have what we would now consider an A-List cast with Victor McLaglen as Hercules, Myrna Loy as Cleopatra, and Jean Harlow as Venus. However, all of the stars reportedly balked at the prospect being in a film with &quot;sideshow exhibitions.&quot;<br /><br /> This 1932 film is clearly Browning's best film, vastly superior to the more famous &quot;Dracula,&quot; which, after all, was basically a filmed stage play for the most part. It is not even close. You might screen this film for the first time because of its reputation, but you will watch it again because it is a pretty good film, especially given the time at which it was made.d Lady, Koo Koo the Bird Girl, Martha Morris the Armless Wonder, and Randion the Living Torso, who rolls his own cigarettes despite having neither arms nor legs.

B00005JMJ4|2.0|I do not understand how anyone can rate this film 5/5 notwithstanding the fact the director received an academy award for best director?!    When I think of this film, the two words that ruminate over and over again in my head are \\"boring\\" and \\"trite\\".    Besides one or two scenes with Bill Murray the film has no value as a comedy. The storyline is weak and amounts to nothing more than a friendship struck between two people in a foreign country...um...with a few stereotypical scenes thrown in of Tokyo/Japanese culture...and then it ends.  I just cannot see that the film possesses any deeper meaning or artistic merit than that.     I guess American audiences will lap it up but otherwise for those who have a tangible understanding of the outside world you will find the attitude the film has towards Japenese culture and language to be contrived and shallow.

0393316041|5.0|This collection of anecdotes from Professor Richard P. Feynman is an excellent treatise into the life of a remarkable scientist. With stories ranging from playing the the Carnival in Brazil to his visits to Japan and Vegas, Feynman shatters the illusion that a scientist must be dry and dull.

B0001HAHXW|2.0|This entire album sounds flat and uninspired. The guitar playing is just okay. The rhythms Clapton chooses for many of these Johnson gems seems off and further detracts from their impact on the listener. Some cuts seem to drag and sound somber, others are played too fast when they should be done slower, with more feeling. <br />  <br /> If you want to hear some terrific covers of Robert Johnson songs try Peter Green's; Hot Foot Powder (his Robert Johnson Songbook is also pretty good). Or you can always go straight to the master himself with The Complete Works of Robert Johnson.  <br />  <br /> This CD does nothing to change my opinion that Clapton's best blues playing is past. Clapton sites Johnson as his main inspiration, but here he doesn't do justice to Johnson's songs.

B0001ZX0PG|3.0|A decent entertaining melodrama, but very far from great. The plot depends on entirely too many improbable coincidences and late revelations to be taken seriously. Many of the characters speak obscurely instead of plainly (just like all your blue collar aquaintences  ). Eastwood's overall direction is competent, but not outstanding. The editing is horrible: the last scenes come out of nowhere like they're from a different movie and some of the character arcs get distractingly short shrift. Tim Robbins does an excellent job of portraying a tortured soul. Sean Penn is an Oscar level actor, but since when is playing high strung Irish a stretch for him? In any event, one viewing is enough.    I have to add something for the folks who weren't paying attention: there are two facts presented (one very early in the story); that separately establish that Tim Robbins did not murder Sean Penn's daughter.
1592400876|3.0|One can hardly grant full marks to a punctuation book that does not extol the serial comma. The author (usually) omits it and gives no reason for her preference; unlike most who avoid the serial comma, she mentions a couple points in its favor. Ironically, she fails even to note that her later example &quot;Don't guess, use a timer or watch&quot; lacks the ambiguity she ascribes to it if written by an author who consistently uses serial commas. If you require solider reasons for insisting on its use, try an Internet search on &quot;parents God comma&quot;. <br />  <br /> This is rather a funny book, and we in the U.S. certainly needn't expect British humour to be exactly the same as ours. Still, it seems a bit odd to allude to abortions in a humorous context even in our so-called civilization. <br />  <br /> Indeed there is much to praise in this book. Most of the advice given is sound, particularly that on the use of what we Americans call quotation marks. It was a nice surprise to see double quotes used in a British context (and kudos to the American publisher for not dumbing down the opus by Americanizing it). The modern British preference for leaving punctuation outside quotation marks, when warranted, is catching on over here too, especially in technical use; this book provides a welcome introduction to it for non-technical Americans. <br />  <br /> The advice on forming possessives turned out to be sound but unnecessarily prolix, and the author omitted the key information on how a possessive such as Thomas' is pronounced by the organization that insists on that spelling. (And did you know there's no apostrophe in Harrods?) <br />  <br /> The author provides a lot of information new to me; still, I've run across a lot in other places that could have given some valuable weight to this slender volume, which you can enjoy in a single afternoon or evening. So, unless you're a student in a course for which it's recommended or required, my advice is to save money bywaiting for a future paperback or remaindered edition. This book is timeless; you needn't rush...
B00008ADPF|4.0|this is what rock music is supposed to sound like, I heard &quot;feelin' way too damn good&quot; and &quot;figured you out&quot; on the radio and actually wasn't sure what band it was, not that is a bad thing, I'm not real good at names, but was just stunned at how good the songs sounded compared to most of the crap on the radio. I am not sure I would classify Nickelback as grunge, but they are a very good rock band, Maybe borderline grunge (smile)
0792110188|5.0|I know that &quot;El Dorado&quot; is basically a remake by Howard Hawks of &quot;Rio Lobo,&quot; which was made a whole seven years earlier, but I like this 1966 film better. It is not just that you have both John Wayne and Robert Mitchum fitting comfortably into their roles but you also have young James Caan and old Arthur Hunnicutt in colorful supporting roles. There is a sense of fun to the proceedings even as everybody takes them seriously.<br /><br /> Wayne is Cole Thornton, an ace gunslinger who turns down an offer to join up with hired gun Nelse McLeod (Christopher George) at the behest of Bart Jason (Edward Asner), the big shot of the town of El Dorado, because it means going up against old pal J. P. Harrah (Mitchum). But it turns out that Harrah has been hitting the bottle hard, so Thorton decides to help his old friend. Unfortunately he is wounded by a bullet that is lodged near his spine and causes paralysis from time to time. Also on their side are old Bull Harris (Hunnicutt) and the young Alan Bourdillion Traherne (Caan), who is called &quot;Mississippi&quot; by his friends for obvious reasons. Maudie (Charlene Holt) is the woman who would like to see Colt and J.P. live to die of old age and Joey (Michele Carey) is the young hothead who shots Thornton and catches the eye of Mississippi.<br /><br /> This is an interesting film from Wayne's perspective because the Duke keeps letting his co-stars have most of the big moments. True, the script dictates that his character has to allow Mitchum's drunken sherrif to redeem himself, but Wayne gets credit for being the rock on which this film is made. Ultimately, &quot;El Dorado&quot; is driven more by the engaging characters than the action of suspense. It is also one of the last Westerns to have a rowdy theme song, with George Alexander, backed by the Mellomen, singing the title written by Nelson Riddle and George Alexander.<br /><br /> In addition to Hawks and Wayne being around for both films, Leigh Brackett did the screenplay for both as well and I think a large measure of the success of &quot;El Dorado&quot; goes to her for creating these characters. She obviously gets the credit for the dialogue, which really does not provide the sort of one-liners that you want to quote ad infinitum, but which still provides a lot of humorous little moments driven more by the characters than the words. The result is not a classic Western in the John Ford mold, but still it is a solid one which makes it well above average all things considered.Brackett did the screenplay for both as well and I think a large measure of the success of &quot;El Dorado&quot; goes to her for creating these characters.

B00008EY65|3.0|I really enjoyed Hellboy. I have been reading the comics since they started, and this film does a great job capturing their gothic feel. Also, Ron Perlman is Hellboy; absolutely perfect, in fact.<br /><br /> BUT, from the director's commentary on the deleted scenes, we learn that in a few months an extended version is going to be released. del Toro has said that this release &quot;is for the fan of the movie; the second will be for the collector.&quot;<br /><br /> Get this movie, but wait to see what the specialer version looks like in a few months first.
B00008EY65|5.0|&quot;Hellboy&quot; is the movie adapted from a comic book for people who did not read the comic book, which, in this case, would be me. That means I was free of any and all preconceptions regarding characters, casting, and plot this time around, unlike previous experiences with Batman, Spider-Man, and the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. But even from a tabula rassa perspective it is hard to believe that anybody other than Ron Perlman could have played the title role in &quot;Hellboy.&quot;<br /><br /> The first key point about this movie is that &quot;Hellboy&quot; works even before Perlman shows up as Big Red and takes over the movie. We begin in 1944 in Scotland, where a bunch of Nazis have shown up in order to open an inter-dimensional portal to the dark side and summon forth the Seven Gods of Chaos. True, this is going to end the world, which is probably a bit more than Hitler was bargaining for, but it seems that the original Russian mad monk Grigori Rasputin (Karel Roden), his Aryan bride of death Ilsa (Bridget Hodson), and the blade loving Nazi psycho Kroenen (Ladislav Beran) have a slightly different agenda. Fortunately, young Professor Trevor Broom (Kevin Trainor), FDR's psychic advisor, and the U.S. Army stop the Nazi plot. The portal is closed, but not before a little red-skinned horned demon comes through from the other side.<br /><br /> We jump ahead to the present, where the rumored sightings of Hellboy are a tabloid staple. Young clean-cut F.B.I. agent John Myers (Rupert Evans) becomes a part of the agency's Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense where Professor Broom (John Hurt) introduces him to &quot;Abe&quot; Sapien (Doug Jones does the acting but the voice is provided by David Hyde Pierce), a fish like mind-reader/psychic and the adult Hellboy in all of his glory. Meanwhile, sixty years later Rasputin and his sidekicks are back again and have managed to unleash a monster from inside a statue at the museum. The fun part about this particular monster is that every time you kill one, two more are born to take its place. Hellboy has his work cut out for him this time, but Rasputin and Kroenen do something that makes this really personal for our hero.<br /><br /> But the ending of the world as we know it is a minor problem compared to Hellboy's love life, which is fixated on the melancholy Liz Sherman (Selma Blair). She is a pyrokineticist who bursts into flames when she gets excited or angry. He is a seven-foot red skinned demon from another dimension who is impervious to fire, so it is clearly a perfect match. But once John convinces Liz to come back to the fold they start spending time together, forcing Hellboy to sneak around on rooftops spying on them. However, this is all just a prelude to the final showdown with the bad guys and their monsters. More than any other comic book superhero on the big screen, Hellboy really takes a pounding. But the big guy keeps coming back for more.<br /><br /> Perlman is pitch perfect as Hellboy, his baritone voice providing depth to the character beyond the awesome makeup job. Working from Mike Mignola's Dark Horse comic books, director Guillermo del Toro (&quot;Blade II&quot;) creates a suitable gothic atmosphere for Hellboy to have his knockdown drag out battles. But the star here is Perlman's Hellboy. This is pitch-perfect casting and Perlman is even better here than he was as Vincent on television's &quot;Beauty and the Beast.&quot; If anything, he is bigger and better than the movie he is in, which is a pretty good accomplishment for a comic book movie. This guy watches out for kittens during a fight. What is not to love about Hellboy?<br /><br /> The bonus disc for this DVD is even better, especially for those who like to see the nuts and bolts of making a movie. There are two commentary tracks, the first by the creative forces of director Guillermo del Toro and the comic book's Mike Mignola, the second with actors Ron Perlman, Selma Blair, Rupert Evans, and Jeffrey Tambor. The documentary, &quot;Hellboy: The Seeds of Creation,&quot; is longer than the movie and you can spend hours going through everything. Be sure you find the illustrated biographies of the characters along with all the scene by scene comparisons available. I rated the movie, which is arguably the second best superhero movie of the century after &quot;Spider-Man 2,&quot; a 4.5 and was going to round down, but that is impossible with this bonus disc.ert Evans, and Jeffrey Tambor.

0800141660|4.0|Sense and Sensibility wasn't the strongest or most well-developed of Jane Austen's novels, but the characters will still draw you in, especially as they are portrayed so well in this movie version.  The film is visually beautiful (it has the quality of a brightly colored painting), and the performances are absorbing.  Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet play Elinor and Marianne Dashwood respectively, two sisters whose family has been made poorer after their father's death.  Elinor is a sensible and practical young lady, so level-headed in fact that Marianne wonders whether she will ever love passionately; Marianne, on the other hand, is a decided romantic, easily swayed by flowers, poetry and pretty talk.  In the movie they experience the highs and lows of love, and come to learn more about one another and lean upon each other as sisters should.   <br /> <br />On the male side of the equation are Edward Ferrars (Hugh Grant), John Willoughby (Greg Wise), and Colonel Brandon (Alan Rickman).  Elinor comes to feel deeply about the genial, slightly bashful Edward (more than anyone can guess), but must keep her feelings restrained when she discovers that he is promised to another.  As for Willoughby and Brandon, both men factor in Marianne's life.  Willoughby is young and dashing, sweeping Marianne off her feet and playing to all her fantasies of romance; Brandon is an older man who knows he has slim chances with Marianne, and for most of the movie resigns himself to admiring her from afar. <br /> <br />The movie is not always tidy in bringing these relationships to resolution (just as the novel is not), but the acting is wonderful, particularly Emma Thompson as Elinor and Alan Rickman as Colonel Brandon.  Sense and Sensibility is ultimately a delightful entertainment.
B00007KWI9|4.0|&quot;Yes&quot; is the original debut album from Yes not to be confused with &quot;The Yes Album,&quot; which was their third album but the first one with which most people would be familiar. &quot;Yes&quot; is not as strong an album, but it is a lot better than you would expect given the level of performance excellent you expect from the group down the road, especially since at this point you have Peter Banks on guitar and Tony Kaye doing the assorted keyboard work. Most of the songs are written by vocalist Jon Anderson and bass player Chris Squire, along with covers of songs by Lennon & McCartney (&quot;Every Little Thing&quot;) and Crosby & McQuinn (&quot;I See You&quot;). It is rather strange to thing of the Beatle and the Byrds being major influences on Yes, but there you go. This is an album for lifelong fans of the group to check out, now that it has been reissued. Knowing where the Yes sound ends up, you can hear it in embryonic form, most notably on &quot;Harold Land,&quot; which most anticipates the multi-part suites that would consume an entire record side on the group's best albums. However, when you hear the driving sound of the opening cut, &quot;Beyond and Before,&quot; you will wonder who you are listening to. Banks does some interesting guitar work on both of the cover songs, especially the atypical version of the Beatles song.<br /><br /> This 2003 reissue is impressive because the bonus tracks add up to more playing time than the 8 original tracks on the album. The informative liner notes are from Mike Tiano. There early and finished versions of three songs, including &quot;Something's Coming&quot; from &quot;West Side Story,&quot; which particularly fits Anderson's distinctive vocal style (you will be reminded of Yes' later cover of Simon & Garfunkle's &quot;America&quot;). The before and after approach with these bonus tracks is quite interesting. There are few opportunities this good to go back and look at what one of your favorite groups was doing when they were first starting out, which makes this expanded reissue of &quot;Yes&quot; a real treat.favorite groups was doing when they were first starting out, which makes this expanded reissue of &quot;Yes&quot; a real treat. <br />  <br />
B000286S8S|1.0|Washed up bands keep putting out Best of Albums, because they are not good enough to do anything else. This album is no exception. Wasted my money buying this one. Thought maybe the new songs might be good, but they sucked. Seems like a sad ending to a band that was a legend in their time. RIP Van Halen
6302194296|5.0|One of the earliest and best horror films of our age. Nosferatu stars Max Shreck as the horrific vampire, Nosferatu, or Count Orlock. Every single time that the vampire walked into the room towards Harker, I felt compelled to hide under a table or a safe area!  <br /> This is the story of a young townsman named Jonathan Harker, who is sent a business letter by a certain &quot;Orlock&quot;, whom Harker simply knows as a rich count. So, Harker embarks on a long journey through mysterious mountainous, woodsy, and shrouded places to the count's ominous castle. The next events in this silent masterpiece are too terrifying to explain. The best horror film, beside Phantom of the Opera and Metropolis, ever made in our early history. Possibly even in our long century.  <br /> Are we ready for some serious discussion? Can we talk? Unfortunately, countless bad prints, both VHS and DVD, have been made of Nosferatu. The Goodtimes Video release has grainy image quality, but is in the original black & white color format. It does not have a musical score. <br /> A tinted version by Type O Negative has pretty good image quality, but a distracting soundtrack.  <br /> Blackhawk has produced a fairly credible DVD of this classic, with fuzzy image quality but a classical music score.  <br /> Madacy has released an expensive DVD. The picture and sound quality also leave something to be desired.  <br /> Yet another VHS print was duplicated by Timeless Video. I own a VHS version of Metropolis released by Timeless Video, and found it to be better than I expected, though the quality is shoddy compared to the Kino Video print.  <br /> The Kino DVD of Nosferatu is the best on the market yet. The picture quality is fine, and the soundtrack is suitable.  <br /> This old horror classic is guaranteed to send a chill up your spine. So purchase the Kino version today!
B000000WFU|5.0|This album is hard to describe because I havent heard anyting like it. Once could describe it as classical music meets &quot;new age&quot;. The closest thing that comes to mind would be Enya.  <br />  <br /> The music in this album is varied. For myself, I really enjoyed the first 5 songs on the album (hard to say which I like best, perhaps Adiemus or In Caelum Fero??). Several of the songs have a variety of sounds where the music style changes quite a bit (start slow, get faster, and so on). <br />  <br /> However the most unique feature of this album is that the words are made up (check out the website). That's right ... the words were chosen to flow with the music. The composer loves the sound of the human voice (what a wonderful instrument!) and uses it well in this album. I find the tunes very relaxing, and listen to them if Im trying to concentrrate (since the words are gibberish, I dont try to translate them). <br />  <br /> If you are a big Enya fan, perhaps another Adiemus album, &quot;Adiemus IV: The Eternal Knot&quot; is more your speed since it has a distinctive Celtic flair. Overall this is a very enjoyable album if you enjoy classical new age combinations.
B00023BLXK|5.0|I loved this movie i watch it almost every day! it was so great and the acting was really good! Diego Luna was sooooooo great in this movie! The dancing was really really REALLY good i thought. I liked the first dirty dancing but i thought this one kicked it right out of the water! it was so good! Romola Garai i think is one of the luckiest people in the world to get to dance and act with Diego Luna but sometimes during the movie it seemed like she couldnt act...like she great but at times for very short periods of the time i found it really hard to watch cause how she acted didnt seem...right i guess. but other then that i LOVED the movie! the plot, setting, costumes, and EVERYTHING basicly was VERY well done. Everyone who sees this movie will like it; its a very good movie. When and if you see it i hope you enjoy it as much as i did! it was AWSOME!
B000068GA4|5.0|With Danzig's first album release, most believed the band were only capable of playing hard rock and roll, yet with their second release in Lucifuge Danzig adapted more of a blues rock sound to their music. In doing so I believe the band broadend their musical talents and limits and enabled the band members with the chance to play a more comfortable style of music to their liking. Danzig's vocals work better with the overall flow of music and this further increased Danzig's status as one of the most essential rock bands in America. <br />  <br /> Lucifuge continues with the same dark edge of music this band adapted in their classic debut album, though this time contains much slower musicallly talented songs such as the dark Killer wolf(one of danzigs greatest vocal songs), and the classic Evil Elvis ballad that is Blood and Tears. As Proven in the 50's rock and roll style &quot;Long way back from Hell&quot; and the metal style &quot;Tired of being Alive&quot; Danzigs voice could not be more perfectly suited to this album if he tried. I play this album almost everyday as I believe I do not own a greater album than Lucifuge at this point in time. Perhaps the main reason for this is that no other band has ever been able to match the musical talent and strenghth shown in Danzig's albums since the original Misfits. <br />  <br /> Glenn's vocals are supported perfectly with the exeptional talent of guitarist John Christ, the smooth, bouncy basslines from the legend that is Eerie Von, and the pacy drumlines provided by who i believe to be the greatest rock drummer of all time, Chuck Biscuits. The pure raw talent of Lucifuge has not yet been matched by any other rock band since it's eagerly awaited release in 1990. There is not one single filler track that can be found in this perfect album. It's talented music matched with the equally classic vocals from the great Glenn Danzig in all his pure, howling, vocal glory.  <br />  <br />
0671027387|4.0|After reading the subject of this book I was a little worried that I wouldn't enjoy it as much as Angels & Demons or DaVinci Code but I was very wrong.  Although I found the revealing of the villian to be anti-climatic because I felt like I was being led there...I still really enjoyed the details that Dan Brown placed in this book much like his others. I had a very hard time putting it down and would reccomend it to anyone.
B00028HBKC|1.0|I dont see why people would cry over this garbage I can see recognizing the suffering Jesus went through but come on, how come u never hear of people cryin their eyes out when they read the same story in the Bible or watching the movie Jesus of Nazereth which was so much better. This movie is overrated at best I give it one star just because it was directed by Mel Gibson if he wasnt the director I would have given the movie negative stars if i could. Another let down was it WAS NOT IN ENGLISH! I can see trying to be precise or make it feel more real but I do not go to the movies to read I would have rather read it in the Bible again and saved the money it costs to get into the theatre. South Park was so right when stan and kenny was mad they paid and went to get their money back I felt the same way. Shame on people who say Tarantino is too violent and make an exception for this movie.And no most people do not watch Tarantino movies for violence most people watch them because theyre actually good movies. Unlike this one, any ways it sux dont buy it I still can't understand why people could cry during this movie. <br />  <br /> &quot;Is there a sign on the front of my house that says Dead N**ger Storage?&quot; - Q.T. Pulp Fiction :)
B000286S8S|4.0|I was never a big enough fan of the band to buy an album. I don't go for theatrics, etc, and I reacted badly to David Lee Roth's excesses (and some of Eddie's, too). I prefer the Hagar era. This is a great compilation, however, that highlights some really great rock songs. They really are a talented band, and I had a lot of fun listening to this double-disc. I was put off by the cut off ending of &quot;Finish What Ya Started,&quot; but I wonder...is it a joke related to the theme/title of the song? How did it end on OU812? Two of the new songs are okay...the breakfast one was a little too hokey for me. I thought the live tracks were cool to emphasize that Hagar was a good replacement for DLR, and can handle &quot;Panama,&quot; etc. There's definitely a &quot;hit formula&quot; that Van Halen used over and over again...but, hey, these are some of the best power ballads around. (Love Comes Walkin' In, Higher, When It's Love, etc). And who doesn't like &quot;Right Now&quot;???? I would've like to hear one track from Van Halen III with singer Gary Cherone (ex-Extreme singer) just to give a nod to the fact that they had that album. They don't mention that era in the liner notes OR list it in the discography that lists ALL their other albums. There must've been ONE good song on there, right?!?!?!!?
B00024BHTC|1.0|I have read all these reviews and have listened to every track that Nightwish have released to date, and there is nothing special about this band at all.  Dream Theatre is much better than this.  They are heavier, they play decent guitar solos and they write original material.  What half these people are on beggars' belief.  Nightwish's music is annoying to listen to.  I was listening to their album `Destiny's Child' and a track called `Phantom of the Opera'.  I have never heard such a stupid track ever.  It's total b******s.  The album `Once' is just a bigger compilation of stupid tracks which only a **** head could get into.  The opening guitar riff for starters has been done a dozen times before.  What let Nightwish down are 3 main things.  Their singer is awful, they can't write anything original and they are blatantly ripping off music from past metal bands.  If you are looking for something original, avoid Nightwish.
B00004XPPB|3.0|Donnie Brasco is one of those movies I always regarded well...until I watched it again.  After a few years, it doesn't hold up.  Actually, I think it's a pretty bad movie, with only the acting of the leads to recommend it.<br /><br />Perhaps it's The Sopranos effect--we've seen much better written and acted drama involving the Mafia since this movie appeared.  Perhaps we've just been spoiled, so Brasco looks even weaker. Or perhaps Brasco isn't really much to begin with.<br /><br />While it's based on a true story, it's pretty loose.  In fact, the story is almost completely fabricated in order to present a drama that comes off as very forced in some spots, again with the acting being the only saving grace.<br /><br />In the mid-1970s, FBI agent Joe Pistone went undercover as 'Donnie Brasco', a connected guy.  After a couple of years of hanging around made guys, he hooked up with Benny 'Lefty' Ruggeiro, a made guy in the Bonanno crime family.  He hung around for a few more years, even meeting with a couple of bosses, until he ended the assignment and went on to help put about a hundred wiseguys in jail.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the film tries to fit a lot into its running time.  We never get a good sense of how long this assignment is, and how Brasco (Johnny Depp) really gets along with the family.  Instead, we get cliche after cliche.  He's away from his wife (Anne Heche) and his kids, slowly bending his marriage until it breaks, with the requisite cliches about how 'you're becoming like Them', etc, etc.  He has to engage in several unpleasantries, like beating the maitre'd of a Japanese restaurant who insists Brasco remove his boots before being seated...except Brasco keeps his trusty FBI tape recorder in there.  Brasco even helps the crew chop up some bodies after a grisly quadruple hit, reluctantly sawing a leg in a dingy basement.<br /><br />The only recommendation points are the two leads.  Pacino is perfect as the rumpled, passed-over Lefty, who spends much time complaining about the unfairness of the current Mafia administration.  Depp seems much older, and he holds his own.  The rest of the cast is good, though we get the feeling they're not acting so much as playing up stereotypes of guys they've seen in other movies, or even played (Bruno Kirby).  Michael Madsen also does a raspy, Brooklyn accent that slips a couple of times.  It all seems forced, too contrived, and I chalk that up to the writer and the director.  There are some seriously laughable lines in here that I doubt any wiseguy has ever said, the kind of lines and scenes that are flashing 'Exposition'.  The director is a Brit, having previously helmed Four Weddings and a Funeral, perhaps not the best choice for a flick about the Mafia in Brooklyn.<br /><br />Overall, if you're a mob movie addict, you'll have to see the movie.  But I remember it being much better back in 1997.  It's kind of tired, the drama is very connect-the-dots, and perhaps worst of all, most of the material is downright fabricated with only a very loose connection to the real events Pistone covered in the source book.  Also, the movie does very little to even explain what's going on in the Mafia it's depicting--the internal wars, the personal beefs--and it's only illumination is about 'the rules' that Brasco slowly learns from the veterans.  In 2004, many of the details of these events came to light in a federal trial for the current Boss of the Bonannos, making you think the real wiseguys laughed out loud at this.  The film hinges on self-parody many times, especially the repetition of 'fuhgettaboutit', repeated by no less than three of the main actors.  If you don't take it too seriously, and if you realize it's just Hollywood-ized Mafia, it can be a lot of fun.spends much time complaining about the unfairness of the current Mafia administration.

0425166805|1.0|I chased Von Daniken's Chariots when I was in junior high in the mid-70s -- before I was brave enough to read books other than those that fed me what I wanted to hear. After EVD published Chariots and a few sequels, his claims were trashed by the great adventurer Thor Heyerdahl, who recreated how ancients most likely did the things EVD claimed needed the help of ET visitors. Astronomer Carl Sagan also ridiculed the idea that races of ETs, from a planet evolved separately from us, would match ancient drawings of human-like spacemen. Even before these men, Clifford A. Wilson came out with &quot;Crash Goes the Chariots.&quot; Well, after the embarrassment by Heyerdahl, it was if EVD folded his tent and disappeared... until a new generation of book-buyers came of age, I guess.
B000002P7R|5.0|South Saturn Delta gives you a inside look at Hendrix's unreleased studio work. It's always a pleasure listening to new released music that over the years has been sitting at the vaults. As many do know Jimi Hendrix did over hundreds of recordings during his short lifetime. South Saturn Delta is worth a buy for a Jimi Hendrix fan. This is really great work done by the man himself Jimi Hendrix. The coolest recordings on this album is Message To Love, and Little Wing. This is a great album five stars of unreleased material.
B000089RVX|1.0|This CD is nothing but a &quot;polished main stream&quot; Christian &quot;rock&quot;, the lead singer may have good pipes on her but the whole rock & rap and mostly crap is got to go.
B00006AW2M|2.0|I never liked Their Satanic Makesties Request by the Rolling Stones, the whole album was just thrown together poorly. The band actually never where in the studio together for this one. This was all done by Mick Jagger, the way this worked was each band member recorded their part and left it for mick to do the mixing and arrangment. Besides the fact I never liked this album to be honest. Around the same period of time the beatles had just came out with Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band so the rolling stones had to do something very similar. For instance look at the record covers it looks very similar to Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band cover. This was my least favorite Rolling Stones album. Not Recomended!!!!!
0684803356|5.0|I had to write this review because of the review someone else wrote...This person said it was about Hemingway's support for anti-communists and young americans going over to Spain during the civil war to fight the communists...He must not have read the book.  The main character of the book went to fight against the FASCISTS, not the communists.  He hated fascism and wanted to stop the fascist regime from taking Spain.  Fighting on his side were many communists, or Spanish backed by communist nations, such as the spanish generals trained by the communist Russian nation, so how on earth this reviewer could think it was against communism if he read the book is beyond me.  Also, this book is about much more, it explores moral issues and covers themes from love to the truth of war.  Hemingway really makes you see the tragedy and pointlessness of war.
B0001AP158|1.0|I just bought this DVD and was dissapointed beyond belief. Here I was expecting to be rocked and instead it was Bon Jovi on qualudes, playing in a bar that forgot to pay the electric bill. They really should label it when it is an ALL ACOUSTIC concert. But no...instead they make it LOOK like it was worth buying.  <br />Don't get me wrong...some bands can do acoustic sets and still rock. But either this band can't or it was a really bad night. My advice is if you like the acoustic versions of songs then buy the CD and turn out the lights cause this DVD has no visual stimulation at all and too many meaningless, boring ramblings between songs.
B000002I77|5.0|Tommy Bolin's solo on Quadrant 4 is one of the most exciting ever recorded. Cobham's driving him into a frenzy.
B000025H0Q|5.0|the soft fingerpicked guitar at the beginning of introduction just gets you into this masterwork of an album. nick draakes second album is considered to be his masterpiece, and rightfully so. it is definetly his most up beat album, but thats to nick drakes standards. the album is full of beautiful poetry, nicks humble fingerpicked guitar playing, lush instrumentation, and even horns. northern sky, fly, and hazey jane 1 are probably 3 of the greatest songs ever written by anyone. if you are new to nick, this should be the second album you pick up, after pink moon. but all three of his albums should be in everyones colection
B000089RVX|5.0|The CD has no filler. It's a great mix of total thrash metal and beautiful piano melodies with the amazing voice of Amy Lee. I love the songs &quot;My Immortal&quot;, &quot;Hello&quot;, and &quot;Everybody's Fool(opening)&quot; for the beauty, and also like &quot;Going Under&quot;, Tourniquet&quot; and &quot;Whisper&quot; for its raw metal. It's an awesome CD.
B000026FOA|5.0|nick drakes debut album sounds like the starting point for a lost cult legend. even though it's nicks first album, he sounds as though he has been recording his entire life. it's a very sad album (although not as sad as pink moon, mind you), but includes many more instruments than later works. there isn't a bad number on this entire album. every song is a work of art. nicks lyrics(even though they're much more like poetry) sound as though they were written in the 17th century. they really are works of genius and beauty, and nick was without a doubt, one of the greatest poets of the 20th century.
B00005JKJA|1.0|I like thinking movies but this movie made no sense whatsoever. I had a better time watching the George Clooney film Solaris and figuring it out than I did this movie. I like thinking movies and I understand that the director wanted to make people think, but I think the film should also provide a storyline and some answers at the same time. Instead it feels like the movie doesn't know which direction it should go and becomes a huge tumbled mess.  <br /> <br />The movie goes from point A to C, then to point B and back to point A. That's how the scenes seem to go, they feel jumbled and out of place. You'll see what I mean when you see this movie or if you've seen it already. <br /> <br />It starts off with a woman named Rita who is held at gunpoint but in a few seconds the car is involved in an accident and she escapes. She doesn't know who she is or where to go, she hides off in an apartment when she sees the current owners moving out. In the next couple of scenes Naomi Watts comes in, her character is Betty and she comes in to her Aunt's house and discovers the Rita, then she helps Rita find her identity.  <br /> <br />I felt the movie was meaningless especially when the two men are out at a diner and one of them discribes a dream that he had. The two then go out from the diner to the back and a scary face comes up and kills one of the guys because its so scary. What does that mean? What the heck??? <br /> <br />The diner scene is again revisited but makes no sense whatsoever. As the movie continues the viewers find out that Naomi Watts was once the lesbian lover of Rita (who is a movie star). Jealousy ensues and then Naomi Watts's character ends up dead somehow.  <br /> <br />One of the scenes has Betty and Rita find a blue box with a mysterious key, that leads them to go to a night club. Yeah I didn't get the meaning of that.  <br /> <br />I wish the movie had been a thinking movie, that provided a good storyline and had some answers in addition to the viewers answers. And I wish the movie had gone from point A to point B and to point C like it does in 99% of Hollywood movies. Instead it doesn't make any sense. I was really disappointed. The movie is complete garbage. <br /> <br />Another thing that I didn't like was all the lesbian scenes. I wasn't comfortable with it, its just weird seeing two chicks kiss and be affectionate with each other. If gay people can speak their mind then so can I. Rita and Betty are lesbian lovers, and in one scene Betty (Naomi Watts) masturbates. Blech! <br /> <br />Do we really need to see that? No! It's complete porno. What a piece of junk this movie is! I'm sorry that I wasted my time watching this piece of garbage.
0767811070|4.0|One of the things few people notice when watching Boyz N tha Hood is that the plot is just a rehash of Cooley High. Basically Ghetto quasi-intellectual has a friend that is really good at sports and got a scholarship. And while this quasi-intellectual kid is around in the movie he makes some girl lose her virginity.  <br />Even though this movie's plot is just a rehash it is important to judge a movie on its own merits rather than contrast it to others. Boyz N tha Hood is a good movie in its own right. The acting is very good. Even Ice Cube who has today been relegated to cheap black comedy and lame action films did a fine job. However this movie does have its plotholes, for example why did Cuba's character have to move from the nice parts of town to the ghetto? But that is all ok. <br />What this movie is, is Cooley High for a new generation. Set in a different city, a different decade, and with a different soundtrack (the soundtrack of the former movie was Motown). This movie was entertaining and one could truly feel sorry for the characters who lost their lives for no good reason. Unfortunately this movie mirrors the reality of the life people face in the ghetto.
B00008GKEG|3.0|I liked this series, especially the various live footage, but I also have a few complaints. <br />  <br /> &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot; is a VERY nice, almost fawning, portrayal of the Beatles, and their bitter and sometimes even hate-filled breakup is made to look like a friendly mutual decision where everybody loooooooves each other and just want to move on with their lives, yadayadayada. <br />  <br /> The fact that comments from the three surviving Beatles (anno 1996-97) and their various associates are never commented upon or analyzed in any way makes &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot; a bit of a bland experience at times...some sort of unbiased commentary (other than various newscasters in old 60s TV clips) would have been nice. <br /> As it is, &quot;Anthology&quot; just rolls along, a bit monotously, offering a pleasant, often entertaining look at the career of the Beatles, but never analyzing or explaining or commenting or just seeing things in a larger context, and that's really a shame.
B000002H97|5.0|OK, I agree with many fans that this Album was quite different from the previous four. However, I do not agree in any way that it was deficient in quality. Sure, they're first couple albums were Thrash Metal at its best. Then the masterpiece, Master of Puppets, and I think the overly-complicated and at times boring ...And Justice For All. Then came this one, which shifted the group into the mainstream. Many feel the songs weren't as rugged and tough just to appeal to radio-listeners. But, I feel that this was the absolute peak of Metallica's career. The writing was great, all members still played hard but toned things down a notch, and as a result came out their best release. All songs are solid, especially &quot;Enter Sandman&quot;, &quot;Sad But True&quot;, &quot;The Unforgiven&quot;, and &quot;The God That Failed&quot;. This is a must for any Metal fan! Long live Metallica!
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|Why do people buy this cool movie? The acting of Ralph Machio? No! They buy it for Steve Vai's bad ass duel scene. Therefore, why not stick Vai's face with his model-like cheek bones on the cover? <br /> <br />This movie, perhaps similar to other guitarists, was my Ed Sullivan moment. I just had to go out and buy a guitar and boogie like Steve! <br /> <br />Aside from the Steve Vai goodies, the story is an interesting one, with lots of southern and blues folklore.
B00005JKGO|3.0|The movie that put the 'pap' in 'paparazzi'.  Fellini's examination of the decline and fall of just about everybody ,God included, was such a sensation here when it first opened that theatre owners who had never shown a foreign film before booked it.  This movie was right at the beginning of a new era in movie making.  LA DOLCE VITA was discussed in newspapers and magazines, in sermons around the country and at parties on college campuses everywhere.  It became so famous that it affected the language and brought once taboo subjects openly into popular culture.  Yet it's mostly terrible.  Marcello Mastroianni in the role that took his name around the world plays a one time journalist turned gossip monger among Rome's wealthy indolent.  Yvonne Furneaux is his neurotic, suicidal mistress and Anouk Aimee is a rich play-girl who casually beds him (in a prostitute's flooded apartment) and casually betrays him.  In the most famous and entertaining sequence Anita Ekberg (in a marvelous performance) plays an actress with former Tarzan Lex Barker as her fiance.  This is the episode with the Fountain of Trevi scene.  Ekberg brings so much energy to her role that she keeps the first part of the movie afloat.  But Fellini treats her and most of the other people in the movie as grotesques.  In the final party scene he even quotes the movie FREAKS.  He puts Ekberg through her paces and all one can think of is:  How DOES she keep the front of her dress up?  In his next piece which was part of the anthology film BOCCACCIO 70 he uses her as a nightmare image on a billboard advertising (what else?) milk.  At the heart of the movie is Alain Cuny as Steiner.  Using Cuny was clever as he had become a symbol of European spirituality.  But Fellini doesn't seem to know what to do with him.  There's a party scene at Steiner's apartment where all the characters are supposed to be intellectuals but their conversation is strictly undergraduate.  (The search lights seen through the windows lighting up the Roman sky are for the premier of the Burton-Taylor CLEOPATRA.)  When Steiner comes to a violent end we're supposed to be shocked.  It's a sign that he's discovered that God is either dead or, worse, indifferent and there's no point in going on.  But these intellectuals are just as shallow as everyone else in the movie so there's no real punch.  Most people couldn't even figure out why this episode was there and felt confused rather than shocked.  Also for the first time Fellini used prople as themselves.  Nico shows up and gives a rather enervated impersonation of inert gas.  The end comes on the shores of the sea, the cradle of civilization, at dawn.  The dawn of a new era?  It is for Marcello.  He has become as nasty as the people he writes about.  Fellini may be saying that the world has gone to the dogs but so did MONDO CANE which did it in half the time.  And he may cluck his tongue in disapproval but he seems to love every dirty detail.  Only Ekberg and Nino Rota's music rise above this ash heap
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I can not write much here that the previous 217 reviewers have not. But let me say this, I am a huge Eric Clapton fan. Lately I have been more than disappointed by his spiritless and commercially orientated guitar playing (and music in general). So what's my point? <br /> Eric's guitar does gently weep. Clapton's performance on this release surpasses any I have seen (or heard) in recent memory. He is emotionally and spiritually motivated to play his best; an he delivers. Clapton's Stratocaster during the guitar solo on &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; does indeed shed tears for his departed friend. After the song was over, I was so moved, I found myself &quot;weeping&quot; gently. For that song alone, this set is worth it. Not to mention additional performers: Ringo Starr, Paul McCartney, Tom Petty, and Jeff Lynne to name only a few. <br /> The sound is superb and the bands play brilliantly. This is arguably one of the best concert dvd's I own and definitely the most emotionally & spiritually inspiring. <br /> Anyone who has ever been touched in even the remotest way by George Harrison's music deserves to add this 2 dvd set to their  <br /> cart. You will not be disappointed.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|All of Britney's albums were great,but this is by far the best. She was involved more in these songs and they have much more depth to them. My favorites are: (I got that) Boom Boom=extremely great upbeat dance song;Showdown=Very fun to dance to; Breathe on me=good beat and rhythm to it;Toxic=Great fun song to listen to;Outrageous=love the beat,great dance song;Touch of my hand=Has wonderful instruments in it that makes it a very &quot;have to listen to&quot; song,it's a very good slow song;Shadow=this is a great slow song that really concentrates on Britney's vocals,wonderful ballad;Brave new girl=unklike I've heard before,very upbeat,fun,and digital talking about finally exploring life and having fun;Everytime=Great classic love song,piano and other instruments don't over-shadow Britney's voice. This is a great CD and worth the money,if you are a long time Britney fan, you won't be disappointed.Just at least give it a chance. I wasn't going to get this CD until my friend let me borrow it and I had to get it! Worth 5 stars, she did a wonderful job.
0375432302|5.0|My opinions on this book are based solely on the book's writing style and plot. I don't know the accuracy of the claims in the book and I find them irrelevant in that I consider this book a work of fiction meant solely to entertain. The author only mentions that the societies mentioned in the book (the Priory of Scion and Opus Dei) are real societies.<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code is a thrilling roller-coaster ride of events that surprise the reader at every corner. Brown often ends his chapters on a suspenseful note which leaves the reader anxious to read on. He starts off the novel with the murder of Jacques Sauniere, a prominent man working at the Louvre. The plot continues as Sauniere leaves a message for his granddaughter Sophie Neveu and Harvard professor Robert Langdon at the scene of his death. Neveu and Langdon are sent on a sort of treasure hunt (where symbols and clues are everywhere they turn) to learn why Sauniere and others have been killed and to find the Holy Grail.<br /><br />I find that the plot is excellent in terms of its riveting sequence of events. I found myself involved, trying to figure out the clues along with the characters. Some of the things Neveu and Langdon find are very controversial. But, they don't shatter any beliefs I had before. If anything, the claims about the church and about Jesus make me want to investigate the issues for myself.<br /><br />For readers who can get past the controversial nature of the book, this is a suspenseful page-turner that keeps you hanging every step of the way.
0671027387|1.0|This is one of the worst thrillers I've read in several years.  Dan Brown does no research whatsoever in writing his books.  It may sound like nitpicking, but he gets every scientific and technical aspect wrong.  F-14s that fly at supersonic speeds from Washington to the North Pole and land on the ice.  Powered skis that can go up hill and then recharge on the downhill (perpetual motion?).  I won't give away the ending, but it's so implausible as to be laughable.  Don't waste your time with this one.  There are plenty of better authors out there that at least bother to do some fact-checking.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|Britney has released her album &quot;In The Zone&quot; and i have been putting off taking a listen to it. Well i have to say that i was pleasantly surprised when i finally popped it into the cd player in my car. Yet that doesnt mean i love it. Its all in good fun and Britney knows how to dance her butt off. The singles are the songs on here that really stick out. &quot;Toxic&quot; is a great piece of pop and possibly the best Britney single ever. &quot;Me Against The Music&quot; featuring Madonna would have been a whole lot better if there was LESS production and &quot;Breathe On Me&quot; sounds exactly like Kylie Minogue added with that Britney sass we have all learned to love or hate. Everything else on the album sounds like a mess. The R. Kelly produced &quot;Outrageous&quot; makes me want to commit suicide and the song that she wrote with Moby is putrid. My advice is listen to the singles on the radio and hope that &quot;Breathe On Me&quot; is released so you wont have to spend your hard earned allowance on this album.
0553266306|5.0|The day of the jackal without doubt was one the most powerful issues in the seventies . The story is loaded with potent realism and the characters are so well defined that it will be very difficult for you to abandon the reading.<br /><br />In my personal case , I read it in just one night . Forsyth wrote other brilliant best sellers but this is one of the top winners .<br /><br />This novel has been adapted to the screen twice , the first entrie directed for Fred Zinnemann (Edward Fox in the role of the Jackal) and the last for Michael Caton Jones (with Bruce Willis as the Jackal) .
B00028HBKM|5.0|I had very strong emotional feelings toward this movie, I hadn't ever cried so much on a film in my life, but this is not an ordinary film. I couldn't stand seeing someone I love so dearly getting whipped and tortured so horribly by the people he came to die for and loves ever so much. Jesus is such a beatiful person, the son of god. I could just feel the love and pain he had in his heart, but I saw not a trace of hatred. I would really want to thank the director who went ahead and made this truly amazing film, showing how it really was and not sugar coat the story. I can't stand hearing fools bad mouth this stunning film, so I try to avoid listening to their senseless sayings. The movie is not there to convert you to Christianity, it is a real-life look into Jesus' life and what he has done for you and me, and all of us. I can't believe that after all he has been through, that all we have to do on our part is accept it. I would recommend this movie to people of all ages, children and adults, for this is not a movie based on senseless violence or other meaningless criteria. It is based on our saviors life, and what he has done for all of us, living or dead.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I must say that Avril's second offering, &quot;Under My Skin,&quot; is a huge improvement from her debut CD. Track by track run-down: <br />  <br /> 1. Take Me Away - Not necessarily single material, but still a good opening song. (4/5) <br />  <br /> 2. Together - My favorite part of this song comes right after the bridge, when the chorus mixes with an upper-register breakdown. (4.5/5) <br />  <br /> 3. Don't Tell Me - Great choice for a first single. Allows her to make the move from punk-chic to...chic. (5/5) <br />  <br /> 4. He Wasn't - It's not bad, but it sounds like part two of &quot;Sk8er Boi.&quot; Hopefully, this will not be released as a single. (3.5/5) <br />  <br /> 5. How Does It Feel - One of my favorites on this CD. The song builds into this guitar driven rocker by the end. Deserves radio play. (5/5) <br />  <br /> 6. My Happy Ending - Second single from the CD...excellent choice, period. (5/5) <br />  <br /> 7. Nobody's Home - This song is slated to be the third single from this CD. I like songs that tell stories - this one is of a girl who has seen better days. Nicely executed. (5/5) <br />  <br /> 8. Forgotten - The spirit of Alanis Morisette in her Jagged Little Pill days now lives in Avril Lavigne. (4.5/5) <br />  <br /> 9. Who Knows - I usually listen to the first few seconds of this song, then skip to track 10. When I do listen to it, though, I realize that I like it (sans the first few seconds)... (4/5) <br />  <br /> 10. Fall To Pieces - Favorite song on this CD. I especially enjoy the bridge of this song, when she goes from her lower register to a full-on rant. Gives me chills. (5/5) <br />  <br /> 11. Freak Out - This is a fun song, kinda in the vein of Sum 41 (didn't she/isn't she dating a guy from that band???) Love the guitar riff. (5/5) <br />  <br /> 12. Slipped Away - Good closing song...a little sad, especially after track 11. (4/5)
B0002EXH4A|5.0|This album always struck me as their best. Maybe because it had been the first one I got. Or maybe because the music kicks ass and the lyrics are so sick. And now with this beautifully done remastered edition these songs become so much more. The worst song might be the cover of 'Anarchy' But there is no worst song.    Nuff said..........
038551123X|4.0|This is an awesome book. The first 10 minutes found me saying &quot;I don't know what to think about this book.&quot; The next 10 minutes found me in love! Dexter works for the Miami Dade police as a blood splatter analyst. In his off-hours Dexter is a serial murderer. With a very strict set of rules.  <br />  <br /> His foster father Harry, himself a cop, realized what Dexter was when he was young. He taught him the &quot;rules of Harry&quot; which include: blending in with others (even if they make no sense to you), only kill &quot;bad guys&quot;, prepare, prepare, prepare, keep your crime scene immaculate, etc.  <br />  <br /> Dexter has a girlfriend who makes no demands on him, and works to appear like everyone else. When his foster-sister needs his help to solve a series of murders of prostitutes and get moved from Vice to Homicide, Dexter goes to work.  <br />  <br /> As the &quot;artist&quot; keeps taunting the police, his elegant work begins to remind Dexter of someone. He's so enamored of the work this killer is doing that he makes a few mistakes of his own. Dexter begins to fear that maybe *he* is the one killing the prostitutes.  <br />  <br /> This is such an awesome story -- Dexter is wonderful! You couldn't help but like him. Great concept! This story is witty, dark and funny.
B0002EXH4K|5.0|This was the album that was going to put Megadeth on the map. New fans hopped on and the songs were mainstream(for MD at the time)enough for the masses to accept it.Very crisp and clear tight sound. Well done again Dave. This edition rocks. A few things different, new riffs emerge from the back of the old mixes and enhances the feel. I used to hate the title track for some reason or another. Now I can't get enough of it.And ofcourse the bonus tracks are always a treat.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Although Gavin DeGraw is just an up and coming artist this album really sets him up to be the next big thing.  It such a soothing album without putting you to sleep.  It is also a very upbeat album, which is a refreshing change from many albums that are being released today.
B000002H7I|5.0|Tracy's voice is full of truth.  She tells her stories with strength and honesty.  No bells and whistles here.  It's just Tracy.   <br /> <br /> <br />I highly recommend this CD.   <br />
B00023BLXK|4.0|I really liked this movie. I've watched it three times already and enjoy it each time. It's based on a true story of a girl who moved to Cuba with her family prior to the revolution. The story, dancing, and music make this movie a hit. Diego Luna and Romola Garai have great chemistry. I enjoyed this movie and the music so much that I had to buy the soundtrack.
B000002HHB|5.0|&quot;Wonder&quot; and &quot;Jealousy&quot; are the best tracks!  <br /> Merchant is a great singer and songwriter. She has a unique sound that she can call her own. That is a great way to be successful. It will be interesting to see her grow in her musical career over the next 10-20 years.
B00006SFBD|5.0|Yes,i will get bashed for saying this,but i think this is the best Opeth cd of them all. Being said, all of their cd's are top nocth. I feel that this is a pinnacle for them, in sound and production. This band redifines music everytime they put out and album, and as soon as you turn on this disc you will see what i speak of. You may ask, what are the stand out tracks on this disc? Well, the title track, A fair judgement, and the pain i see in others, and masters apprentices are those stand outs. To listen to the soft, melodic A fair judgement, then turn around and listen to the brutal, death metal sounds of master's apprentices, you will see the great variety you get in this band. I really cant think of another band who can make such sudden breaks and tempo changes sound so crisp, and do it so many times over in one song. This isnt the 3 minute pop punk of today, these guys are real musicians who play sometimes 13 to 20 minute songs. After listening to Deliverance, i pose the question. How many drummers can you name that are better than Martin Mendez? The list will be ever so short. Some say that this is the heaviest Opeth album of them all. I have heard other songs of thiers on older albums that may be heavier, but as a whole, i think this album may be the heaviest. If you are new to Opeth, get this cd before you get damnation. Damnation was a one time experiment, and not what Opeth really sounds like, although it is a great cd as well.
B000002UW1|5.0|Good group. Saw them in St Paul in the early 90's. It's a good show.   They are a nice alternative to commercial rock..and they remain fresh today. :)  <br />
B000286S8S|3.0|Where are...   (Dont Tell Me) What Love    Can Do, Where Have All the Good Times Gone, Humans Being, Ice Cream Man, Amsterdam (surprised more reviewers did'nt mention this track), Feelin', Without You(even though it's with Gary Cherone, still a great song),Mean Street, So This Is Love, and Me Wise Magic or Can't Get This Stuff No More (which were supposedly hits on the first &quot;Best of&quot; compilation). My opinion...leave out the 3 new so called &quot;hits&quot; and leave out the 3 live tracks, make it a 3 cd set, add all the songs I mentioned and make it a TRUE best of compilation.   I also do not understand why so many bands include new tracks on best of compilations. Release them separately.
B000069HK2|4.0|The Used first CD is amazing.The only reason That I gave it 4 Stars instead of 5 is because i know that they have only scratched the surface of there musical abilities, and there are a couple of tracks that just don't stand out to me. <br /> <br />1.MAYBE MEMORIES 7/10 an ok song doesn't really do the rest of the CD justice <br />2.THE TASTE OF INK 10/10 A great song, enough said <br />3.BULLIMIC 8/10 Good song and the screaming really adds to the emotion of it. <br />4.SAY DAYS AGO 7/10 good song nothing great <br />5.POETIC TRAGEDY 8/10 Good song starts off slow and picks up faster towards the end. <br />6.BURIED MYSELF ALIVE 9/10 another amazing song <br />7.A BOX FULL OF SHARP OBJECTS 9/10 Good song and the screaming really fits the song <br />8.BLUE AND YELLOW 10/10 This song comes out of nowhere, it souds completely different than the rest of the CD,but its just a flat out good song. <br />9.GREENER WITH THE SCENERY 7/10 Nothing Special <br />10.NOISES AND KISSES 8/10 Decent song <br />11.ON MY OWN 11/10 The only acoustic song on the CD and it really shows Berts singing ability <br />12.PIECES MENDED 7/10 it's ok
B00005JM0B|1.0|Same old repeat story from T1 and T2.. This is horrible non sense story with alot of foul words... Don't bother to buy this movie because it definitely will waste your time!
B00008EY65|5.0|The trailer actually looked good for this film. Despite that, it was with some misgivings I went and saw it. To my delight it was good! Perhaps not a truly great film, but a real piece of artisanship. The actors are very well cast, I would even say extremely so. The story is adequate to good, a bit standard fare. I liked Kronen. I thought that Baphomet, the monster, was a bit weak as an adversary, even if they do pull it off in the end.<br /><br />What does make it so good is that the director knows his horror. Inspiration from Lovecraft (the monsters in the sky, the labyrinth, the temple in Rumania), Templar myths (the church in the Hebrides), Escher (the labyrinth), and so on. Kronen and the reanimated dead are brilliant in their gothic horrror. Any fan of the old classic tales of horror an myths will find this film a delightful tribute to the old masters. All the while the director manages to create something new and exciting. He does not sacrifice a good story for special effects or gore.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Donnie Darko had me intrigued within the first two minutes. The music, the tone, and Jake Gyllenhaal's brilliance completely swept me away. Writer/director Richard Kelly has created an altogether awesome movie that is thought-provoking, funny, and sad.       This film is a psychological/sci-fi thriller about a teenager named Donnie Darko who is shown prophetic visions by a six-foot tall rabbit named Frank. Are you thinking Harvey? Think again. This is the scariest rabbit I've ever seen in my entire life. The film begins with a jet-engine crashing through the roof and into Donnie's room. Donnie's not sure what to make of this, and spends the rest of the film on a sort of spiritual journey of faith, love, life, and death.      This movie left me with so many questions, but after trying to pick this movie apart so I could better understand it, I decided to just give up on it. Take this movie as it is, don't try to nitpick it because it will seriously make your head explode.       Everything about this movie is great. Jake gives such a great performance, and he has yet to disappoint me. Noah Wyle, Drew Barrymore, and Jena Malone co-star to create a truly all-star cast. The music is probably my favorite part of the film. The original score evokes the sci-fi/futuristic feeling, but it's also extremely haunting. And the use of the song &quot;Mad World&quot; at the end of the film is the most effectively used song that I've ever seen in a movie.       HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh's latest album, Closer, is an incredible follow-up album to his first. I truly tear up when I hear Mi Mancherai from &quot;Il Postino&quot;. At such a young age, it is amazing that I actually feel he has felt the pain and joy of love when he sings. His talent is truly showcased on this album as a singer, writer, and musician. Every song on this album is beautifully orchestrated and it will be interesting to watch Josh's career blossom even more.
B0002JJBZY|5.0|Where, exactly, does one start talking about THE original series that single-handedly launched the TV sci-fi genre like none that came before it and none has done since? What does one say about the one sci-fi show against which all subsequent sci-fi seems to be some kind of lesser imitation or spinoff? Should discussion begin with the original and imaginative concepts and themes - space warp, time travel, alternate realities and universes, powers of the mind and spirit, transporter beams - or should discussion start by talking about how masterfully familiar human interest themes are woven into a technological vision of the future? Or, maybe discussion should begin with how perfectly the show's central characters both complement and supplement each other at multiple levels of the human experience - the decisive commander-warrior, the rational half-human science officer, and the empathetic healer? <br />  <br /> Ever since I began staying up late Friday nights to watch the original airings with my parents almost forty years ago, viewing rerun after rerun in syndication for the next fifteen years, sometimes twice a day, every day, and watching the spinoffs throughout the next fifteen years, the answers to those questions have always stayed just out of my reach. The problem has always been that my favorite Trek episode was usually the one I happened to be watching, or, if I hadn't been watching one, my top choices seemed to wander from episode to episode from day to day, even from morning to noon to night. I was vaguely aware that it had something to do with who I was, or what I was experiencing as a person at that particular moment. <br />  <br /> For me, the highlights of season one exemplify my sentiments, from &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot;, the powerful opening episode (which was aired out of sequence, for some strange reason) where two crew members, one a personal friend of Captain Kirk, become endowed with mental powers that grow to such strength as tomake them a danger to the ship and crew, to the question and problem of time travel raised in &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot;, which is regarded by many fans as possibly the best sci-fi episode ever produced.  <br />  <br /> Oh, but then there's &quot;Space Seed&quot;, whose sequel was produced in the feature film, &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot;, where the Enterprise is commandeered by a rogue group of genetically-engineered super-leaders from the 20th century. Ricardo Montalban may have turned out the two most memorable performances of his career as the charismatic but overly-ambitious Khan. It is even more impressive when one considers that genetic engineering was barely a blip on the scientific radar in 1965 when the episode was written and filmed.  <br />  <br /> Who can forget &quot;Balance of Terror&quot;, which was Trek's rendition of the movie classic &quot;Run Silent, Run Deep&quot;, which tells the story of two seasoned commanders playing a deadly game of cat and mouse in in deep space? This episode features Mark Lenard, who would also act the part of Spock's father in several future TV episodes and the feature film, &quot;The Search for Spock&quot;. <br />  <br /> Season 1 also gives fans the first glimpse of the mischievous but lovable space-rogue Harcourt Fenton (aka &quot;Harry&quot;) Mudd in &quot;Mudd's Women&quot;. Viewer beware - do not allow the episode's light-hearted tone to obscure it's message, that physical beauty is merely an outward manifestation of one's true, inner beauty.  <br />  <br /> After the resounding success of season one, season two delivered more of the same while yet retaining the original and imaginative themes and character development. Deforest Kelley, acting the part of Dr. McCoy, is now billed as a leading part in the series, and we are introduced to the young, quirky, and often funny Pavel Chekov. <br />  <br /> Season two gives us our first look at the mysterious Vulcan ritual of &quot;pon farr&quot; - the boiling of the Vulcan blood - which drives Vulcans to mate every seven years. &quot;Amok Time&quot; places Kirk between a rock and a hard place as he is maneuvered by a scheming Vulcan female to battle his friend and first officer Spock. The theme of the first Star Trek feature film is also foreshadowed in season two as the crew of the Enterprise are sieged by Nomad, an old Earth space probe that was reprogrammed by an advanced civilization to fulfill its original mission - return to its creator, at all costs. <br />  <br /> Season two also led the sci-fi genre as it explored the subject of alternate realities and universes in &quot;Mirror, Mirror&quot;, where a transporter accident causes Kirk and his landing party to switch places with their counterparts in an evil, chaotic universe. Rationality is constant in both universes, though, as &quot;evil&quot; Spock figures out what happened and aids &quot;good&quot; Kirk and co. in their return home. <br />  <br /> &quot;The Doomsday Machine&quot; tackles the problem of weapons of mass destruction 35 years before the concept became a household term. Always on the cutting edge of sci-fi, season two brings the viewer back to Harry Mudd, who returns in &quot;I, Mudd&quot; a whimsical adaptation of Asimov's &quot;I, Robot&quot; crossed with &quot;The Stepford Wives&quot;. Environmental responsibility is addressed in the perennial fan favorite, &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot;, which features a warm fuzzy exotic species that overruns both the Enterprise and a deep-space station while consuming a critical supply of super-wheat. <br />  <br /> Season two is also rich in material that examines Earth's own history. Imperial governments are critiqued in &quot;Bread and Circuses&quot;, where Kirk, Spock, and McCoy encounter the survivors of a previous space-wreck who have modeled a society using Earth's ancient Roman Empire as a model. &quot;A Piece of the Action&quot; revisits the issue of culture contamination as Kirk and Co.encounter an entire planet culture organized around a book called &quot;Chicago Mobs of the 20s&quot;. A social experiment runs out of control in &quot;Patterns of Force&quot; as a society is transformed into a 23d century version of Nazi Germany. <br />  <br /> At a time when most computers were used for experimental purposes in scientific labs, &quot;The Ultimate Computer&quot; addresses the questions of what might happen if computers ever get smart enough to act on their own volition. History is studied directly for the first time ever in &quot;Assignment: Earth&quot;, as the crew of the Enterprise employ their knowledge of the &quot;whiplash effect&quot; to purposefully travel through time. Their investigation of the first moon launch is interrupted as they intercept the mysterious spy-master Gary Seven beaming in from a far-away planet.  <br />  <br /> Season three is often criticized as being the least original and interesting of the three original Star Trek seasons. Although there may be some truth to that sentiment, I believe it is a matter of degree. To say it is the least interesting of the three is not the same as saying that it is not worth watching. There are still many good episodes to stir the imagination. <br />  <br /> In a theme repeated in future Trek spinoffs, Kirk feigns madness leading to his capture by the Romulans in order to execute his master plan to commit espionage aboard a Romulan ship in &quot;The Enterprise Incident&quot;. &quot;Let That Be Your Last Battlefield&quot; is a powerful allegory of the irrational and destructive nature of racism. The feasibility of artificial intelligence was correctly surmised long before the leading researchers in the field reached the same conclusion in &quot;Requiem for Methuselah&quot; where Kirk and Co. encounter a super-genius who has created a seemingly perfect robot spouse who, in the end, is shown to be nothing more than a sophisticated machine incapable of human feelings. &quot;All Our Yesterdays&quot; revisits the time travel theme in a wonderfully written story about Kirk, Spock, and McCoy's encounter with an automated librarian who is the caretaker of the archives of a great civilization that abandoned its homeworld as their sun nears the end of its life in a catastrophic explosion. <br />  <br /> As I watch all these episodes again for what must be the eighth or ninth time, I still see things for the first time I somehow managed to miss throughout all my previous viewings, and I still find myself pondering the large questions of life: who and what is man?, love and hate, war and peace, faith and reason, and all the other issues related to our purpose in this life. The voyage never ended for me.

B0002JJBZE|5.0|Where, exactly, does one start talking about THE original series that single-handedly launched the TV sci-fi genre? What does one say about the one sci-fi show against which all subsequent sci-fi seems to be some kind of lesser imitation or spinoff? Should discussion begin with the original and imaginative concepts and themes - space warp, time travel, alternate realities and universes, powers of the mind and spirit, transporter beams - or should discussion start by talking about how masterfully familiar human interest themes are woven into a technological vision of the future? Or, maybe discussion should begin with how perfectly the show's central characters both complement and supplement each other at multiple levels of the human experience - the decisive commander-warrior, the rational half-human science officer, and the empathetic healer?      Ever since I began staying up late Friday nights to watch the original airings with my parents almost forty years ago, viewing rerun after rerun in syndication for the next fifteen years,sometimes twice a day, every day, and watching the spinoffs throughout the next fifteen years, the answers to those questions have always stayed just out of my reach. The problem has always been that my favorite Trek episode was usually the one I happened to be watching, or, if I hadn't been watching one, my top choices seemed to wander from episode to episode from day to day, even from morning to noon to night. I was vaguely aware that it had something to do with who I was, or what I was experiencing as a person at that particular moment.      After the resounding success of season one, season two delivered more of the same while yet retaining the original and imaginative themes and character development. Deforest Kelley, acting the part of Dr. McCoy, is now billed as a leading part in the series, and we are introduced to the young, quirky, and often funny Pavel Chekov.      Season two gives us our first look at the mysterious Vulcan ritual of &quot;pon farr&quot; - the boiling of the Vulcan blood - which drives Vulcans to mate every seven years. &quot;Amok Time&quot; places Kirk between a rock and a hard place as he is maneuvered by a scheming Vulcan female to battle his friend and first officer Spock. The theme of the first Star Trek feature film is also foreshadowed in season two as the crew of the Enterprise are sieged by Nomad, an old Earth space probe that was reprogrammed by an advanced civilization to fulfill its original mission - return to its creator, at all costs.      Season two also led the sci-fi genre as it explored the subject of alternate realities and universes in &quot;Mirror, Mirror&quot;, where a transporter accident causes Kirk and his landing party to switch places with their counterparts in an evil, chaotic universe. Rationality is constant in both universes, though, as &quot;evil&quot; Spock figures out what happened and aids &quot;good&quot; Kirk and co. in their return home.      &quot;The Doomsday Machine&quot; tackles the problem of weapons of mass destruction 35 years before the concept became a household term. Always on the cutting edge of sci-fi, season two brings the viewer back to Harry Mudd, who returns in &quot;I, Mudd&quot; a whimsical adaptation of Asimov's &quot;I, Robot&quot; crossed with &quot;The Stepford Wives&quot;. Environmental responsibility is addressed in the perennial fan favorite, &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot;, which features a warm fuzzy exotic species that overruns both the Enterprise and a deep-space station while consuming a critical supply of super-wheat.      Season two is also rich in material that examines Earth's own history. Imperial governments are critiqued in &quot;Bread and Circuses&quot;, where Kirk, Spock, and McCoy encounter the survivors of a previous space-wreck who have modeled a society using Earth's ancient Roman Empire as a model. &quot;A Piece of the Action&quot; revisits the issue of culture contamination as Kirk and Co. encounter an entire planet culture organized around a book called &quot;Chicago Mobs of the 20s&quot;. A social experiment runs out of control in &quot;Patterns of Force&quot; as a society is transformed into a 23d century version of Nazi Germany.      At a time when most computers were used for experimental purposes in scientific labs, &quot;The Ultimate Computer&quot; addresses the questions of what might happen if computers ever get smart enough to act on their own volition. History is studied directly for the first time ever in &quot;Assignment: Earth&quot;, as the crew of the Enterprise employ their knowledge of the &quot;whiplash effect&quot; to purposefully travel through time. Their investigation is interrupted as they intercept the mysterious spy-master Gary Seven beaming in from a far-away planet.       As I watch all these episodes again for what must be the eighth or ninth time, I still find myself pondering the large questions of life: who and what is man?, love and hate, war and peace, faith and reason, and all the other issues related to our purpose in this life. The voyage never ended for me.
B0000541AM|5.0|One Of The Top 3 NYC Street Gang movies of all time,very action packed and true to life in some aspects.This film sparked alot of violent incidents all over the place.The movie captured the NYC Gang Culture as it sort of was in NY during the late 70's.If your into films about NYC Street Gangs then this is the one to buy!My only complaint is that the DVD doesn't included deleted scenes,commentary,or photo gallery.I would hope that in the near future the Paramount Company rerelease the DVD with the above included.If you buy this movie also buy The Warriors Book by Sol Yurick.Another Realistic NYC Street Gang Film is Defiance shot in 1979 also in Lower Manhattan.The DVD of this film is not out yet but I think you can get it on VHS.In The End The Warriors is a must buy despite the weak DVD version!I can't wait for the new Playstation 2 game The Warriors from rockstar games due to be released in Jan,2005 along side The Warriors Remake.
B0002I831S|5.0|Where, exactly, does one start talking about THE original series that single-handedly launched the TV sci-fi genre like none that came before it and none has done since?

I was vaguely aware that it had something to do with who I was, or what I was experiencing as a person at that particular moment.      For me, the highlights of season one exemplify my sentiments, from &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot;, the powerful opening episode (which was aired out of sequence, for some strange reason) where two crew members, one a personal friend of Captain Kirk, become endowed with mental powers that grow to such strength as to make them a danger tothe ship and crew, to the question and problem of time travel raised in &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot;, which is regarded by many fans as possibly the best sci-fi episode ever produced.       Oh, but then there's &quot;Space Seed&quot;, whose sequel was produced in the feature film, &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot;, where the Enterprise is commandeered by a rogue group of genetically-engineered super-leaders from the 20th century. Ricardo Montalban may have turned out the two most memorable performances of his career as the charismatic but overly-ambitious Khan. It is even more impressive when one considers that genetic engineering was barely a blip on the scientific radar in 1965 when the episode was written and filmed.       Who can forget &quot;Balance of Terror&quot;, which was Trek's rendition of the movie classic &quot;Run Silent, Run Deep&quot;, which tells the story of two seasoned commanders playing a deadly game of cat and mouse in in deep space? This episode features Mark Lenard, who would also act the part of Spock's father in several future TV episodes and the feature film, &quot;The Search for Spock&quot;.      Season 1 also gives fans the first glimpse of the mischievous but lovable space-rogue Harcourt Fenton (aka &quot;Harry&quot;) Mudd in &quot;Mudd's Women&quot;. Viewer beware - do not allow the episode's light-hearted tone to obscure it's message, that physical beauty is merely an outward manifestation of one's true, inner beauty.       As I watch all these episodes again for what must be the eighth or ninth time, I still see things for the first time I somehow managed to miss throughout all my previous viewings, and I still find myself pondering the large questions of life: who and what is man?, love and hate, war and peace, faith and reason, and all the other issues related to our purpose in this life. The voyage never ended for me.
B00029NMRM|3.0|I highly anticipated this sequel after laughing continually through The Whole Nine Yards.  And while this movie does have some good chuckles (due to the neurotic comedic performance by Matthew Perry), the rest of the movie lacks the punch of the first.  The scripting seems a bit shallow at times, and aside from Perry's performance, the other actors don't seem to be putting out the effort.  Amanda Peet's character shines at points, but at other times seems lackluster.  Since we've already been introduced to the characters in the first movie, the director attempts to throw off the viewer by introducing a plot twist - one which backfires by coming off as chaotic and cliche.  I would recommend the movie for any die-hard The Whole Nine Yards fans, but unfortunately this isn't one for the collection.
B000069KE0|5.0|Chicago are considered by the younger generations to be an 'oldies' band whilst by most jazz fans are genreally considered to have been far too commercial. I am neither of these and love Chicago (especially early) however am confused as to why people seem to right reviews for albums just to say how crap or great they are rather than saying why (I do realise that so far my review is exactly that) as lots of opinions unsupported give the (possible) buyer little help. So here are a few facts and tips for you, the customer... <br /> Chicago released this, their second album (although thier first under the actual name) Chicago (previously Chicago Transit Authority). It was a commercial success at the time and spawned three popular singles:- 25 or 6 to 4, Make Me Smile and Colour My World.  <br /> Musically, the album is a blend of Jazz, Rock, Blues, R & B and (sort of) Classical. If you like the sound of that, then get this. If you have enjoyed another of Chicago's albums, also get this. If you have enjoyed another late 60's early 70's Jazz band (e.g. Blood Sweat and Tears) then give this a try as it's worth that. (If you don't like it you can always write a nasty review about it here.) If you have never before heard Jazz then I'd say this is a good introduction as it is also quite Rock based.  <br /> I hope I've been of service- Toodle Pipskie (Is that how you spell it?)

B000003TA4|5.0|Before purchasing Nevermind, I had only heard a few Nirvana songs and knew little about the band itself. But my growing interest in grunge and the mostly positive reviews I read for the album drove me to purchase the 13-year-old CD, and my gamble paid off handsomely. Nevermind is an excellent album, and packs so much great songwriting, energy, and emotion that it has rightfully been called one of the outstanding records of the 90s. It opens with the classic grunge rocker &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; and moves on the catchy &quot;In Bloom&quot;, the infectious &quot;Breed&quot;, the anguished &quot;Lithium&quot;, and the melancholy &quot;Polly&quot;. Kurt Cobain's ingenuitive songwriting, his passion for music, and his soul-searching lyrics really shine on this album, and he demonstrates the ability to write both slow, introspective tracks like &quot;Something In the Way&quot; and wild, raucus songs like &quot;Territorial Pissings&quot;. Nirvana was a great band mainly because they had such a cohesive, earnest sound and were skilled at playing many different types of rock, from headbanging mosh-pit anthems to touching guitar-driven ballads. Today, Nevermind stands as both a rock classic and the quintessential record from the early-90's grunge era. Very highly reccomended.
0060537639|5.0|Outside the US and European education system, the rest of the world seems to understand that; Columbus did not discover America and that Magellan was not the first to circumnavigate the world. As one of the earliest explorers of the world, China's fleets had accomplished feats that were well ahead of it's time. This book captures those accomplishments in an illuminating and engaging fashion. Menzies cites some thought proviking DNA and physical evidence but I felt there was still need for a smoking gun of sorts.    All in all, this is one of my favorite books since Diamond's Guns, Germs and Steel.
B00026WU3M|5.0|Every Dylan fan has his own best-of list &quot;tatooed to the back of his head&quot; :) My all time favorites are the great 'Desire', & the monumental trilogy 'Infidels','Empire Burlesque' and 'Oh Mercy' (Well -'Knocked Out Loaded' had a few good tunes - but it's miles away...). <br /> Two tracks stand above the rest - 'Political World' & 'Everything Is Broken', that are fast & furious Rocki'sh Masterpieces, that would fit better in Infidels' sound... <br /> And than again, they give great contrast to the rest of the album, which is mellow and enchanting: you can actually feel the Dark, gloomy, swampy quality emenating from your speakers <br /> as you listen to 'She's Gone With A man in a Long Black Coat'... <br /> This Is One CD I can listen to over & over agin for hours. <br /> Yes - It's that Good ! <br />  <br /> The production is imaculate, the singing - in it's best, everything clicks ! <br /> The great guitar sound is so distinctive - you couldn't confuse it with anything else ! <br /> So - If you're a Dylan fan - And ever plan to spend some time on a Dsert Island - (& only allowed to bring a few cd's along ...) - Go for this one first !
B000286S8S|5.0|Here it is, a double CD set of Van Halen's greatest hits with David Lee Roth and Sammy Hagar appropriately titled &quot;Best of Both Worlds&quot; The three new songs &quot;It's About Time&quot;, &quot;Up For Breakfast&quot; and &quot;Learning to See&quot; are good songs. &quot;It's About Time&quot; is the heavy rocker, &quot;Up For Breakfast&quot; is the innuendo filled fun party song, and &quot;Learning to See&quot; is the more serious of the three. They are all filled with the rythyms and leads that made Van Halen what they are, the greatest rock band of all time. This could be the perfect addition to a Van Halen fans collection, or a great CD to get for a young listener just starting out on Van Halen. The remastered older songs take on a new life and make Van Halen sound even better than ever. The end of &quot;Finish What You Started&quot; is kind of annoying, but something I can live with. I could have done without &quot;Strung Out&quot; at the beginning of &quot;Not Enough&quot;, but I'm not going to complain too much about it. It is Van Halen after all! Buy this! You won't be sorry.
1594200106|5.0|Zaf&oacute;n's storytelling skill is quite remarkable, his prose doesn't just take you into the story, it completely transports you. In only a few sentances. Zaf&oacute;n crafts a world of remarkable visions and events--just a little bit magical (as all the best stories really are) but grounded in characters who live, breathe, and merrily cavort off the page and into your heart.<br /><br /> But Zaf&oacute;n isn't just a strong storyteller with an exact sense of prose (and my compliments to the excellent translation!), Shadow of the Wind connects to people, it's almost a watershed. It's been a long time since I've been so excited about a book. I tell -everyone- to read it: best friends, my mom, relatives, people I work with--they're all hearing raves from me. And I don't do that lightly, but this book is joyous and sad, heartfelt and even wise.<br /><br /> But most important of all is that Shadow of the Wind is true. It's one of those rare books where you don't just hear 'their' story, it becomes your story as well. To loosely quote Car&aacute;x, &quot;it holds up a mirror and a window to your soul,&quot; because it teaches us about who we are--about the communities that bind and define you.<br /><br /> And every single moment Ferm&iacute;n Romero de Torres was 'on screen' I had the biggest grins on my face, truly one of the great characters of literature.<br /><br /> I've not a single criticism or reservation about this book, and that puts Zaf&oacute;n on an extremely short list with Mark Twain, Frank Herbert and Orson Scott Card.

B00009MGGI|5.0|I won't rehash the plot, but the real appeal here is Ian Richardson's breaking of the fourth wall. He forces us all to admit that evil can be so fun, and that sometimes the wrong thing to do is completely the right thing.  <br />  <br /> I had read that Richardson wouldn't agree to end the series if F.U. didn't eventually meet his demise. I concur that The Final Cut (the third episode in the set) is by far the weakest, and a politically correct cop-out, but the devilish pleasures of the first two installments more than make up for its mawkishness. The same fascination with evil allows us to feel superior when Francis finally meets his end in the last volume. <br />  <br /> I have to recommend that you buy the whole set to see the complete story, but I'll bet that your repeat viewings will be of the first volume only. It is so awfully, spanking good that you may be shocked at how good you feel about leaving your conscience behind. <br />  <br /> Wish I could make this review relevant to current political times in the U.S., but this series exists solely as a British animal. Its appeal is grounded in the parliamentary system. It's all very Britishly perverse, especially the sexcapades of middle-aged politicians and royals. Pour yourself a Guiness and enjoy the ugliness. You might not think it's appropriate...I couldn't possibly comment. <br />

B00008EY65|5.0|In HELLBOY, author/illustrator Mike Mignola has conceived one of the meanest stories around. Quirky in its blend of macabre wit, searing suspense, and supernatural thrills, the ongoing Dark Horse fright fest is among the most stylish, hard-hitting, genuinely mind-blowing Sequential series ever rendered. Yet it's the author's fine line for depth and subtlety which accents HELLBOY's outrageous escapades with an intricate simplicity, marking the saga as the comic book equivalent of a musical tone poem.<br /><br /> Well, this past spring, Mignola hooked up with director Guillermo Del Toro and legendary character actor Ron<br /> Perlman to bring Mignola's chilling saga to the big screen. If you missed your first chance to catch this rollicking potboiler, run, do not walk, and buy the Columbia 2-DVD set, nicely packaging the film along with deleted scenes, film & TV ads, a detailed documentary and more.<br /> Del Toro, cast, and crew delivers a colorful roller-coaster ride which harkens back to the nail-biting pulp stories of the 1920s, and the cliffhanger matinee serials of the 1930s and 1940s. Its cunning terror opts for the majestically grotesque a la H. P. Lovecraft, amid topical monstrosities worthy of Clive Barker. HELLBOY is refreshingly free of the thudding goguery passing for &quot;Modern Horror&quot; a la ELM STREET's Freddie Krueger, among other cliches.<br /><br /> Perlman's take on Mignola's hard-bitten, acid-tongued, gold-hearted adventurer is a classic all in itself. The inner conflict between Heaven and Hell, grace and damnation, is outlined in every move he makes, and felt in the shading his voice can impart through even the lightest of lines. Catch HELLBOY's struggle in his very eyes, and begin to know what an exceptional job Perlman does here.<br /> Speaking of knockout acting performances, don't miss Selma Blair's smouldering cool as the diffident firebrand Liz Sherman, or Karel Roden's utterly creepy brilliance as the malevolent Rasputin.<br /><br /> From Marco Beltrami's penetrating score to Guillermo Navarro's<br /> unforgettable cinematography, HELLBOY is an enigmatic feast for<br /> the eye and ear and mind. Tweaking the tale just so, while keeping<br /> amazingly true to the heart of Mignola's text,<br /> Del Toro's result is a maddeningly delightful,<br /> gleefully mature film. Check it out!<br /><br /> Oh... and don't forget your cross.ng score to Guillermo Navarro's   unforgettable cinematography, HELLBOY is an enigmatic feast for    the eye and ear and mind.

B00005MAM2|5.0|when i first saw akira i had rented it from a local blockbuster being the anime fan i am i immediately popped it in to my dvd player i was completely unprepared for the shear magnifiscence of the film that is akira. Akira first takes place in 1980's tokyo when suddenly a strange and eerie explosion occurs without warning. Fast forward to a time that is much closer to our own tokyo is a much different place now run by rival biker gangs. This movie follows the exploits of two friends in a gang Kaneda and Tetsuo. Kaneda being the bossy big brother leader type and Tetsuo is more like the younger brother who never gets his chance in the spotlight. One night however they were chasing a rival gang out on an old highway when suddenly Tetsuo sees a little boy that resembles an old man in his headlights and just before he hits him the kid blows Tetsuo's bike up with him still on it. Kaneda and the others arrive on the scene to aid their friend but suddenly out of nowhere the military swoops in and abducts the strange looking kid and tetsuo as well. Tetsuo unaware of what is going on awakens in a hospital bed and comes to the realization he now has telekinetic powers. Tetsuo breaks out and goes to find Kaneda however after stealing Kaneda's bike he and naive girlfriend kaori are tracked down by the gang he was chasing the night before and ends up getting the crap beat out of him and his girl before kaneda comes to the rescue which makes it apparent that kaneda has been saving Tetsuo's butt since they first met.Suddenly Tetsuo is seized with a terrible headache and starts having dillusions of his guts coming out where he is later recaptured by the military. However as days pass tetsuo's power becomes stronger but so is his insanity and lust for violence. But when things start getting out of control Tetsuo becomes a threat to himself and others and it is finaly revealed who or what akira was. In a city full of lawless street gangs, violent police, corrupt poloticians, doomsdaycults,and numerous truth seeking rebel groups can the power of friendship save them? Akira is a violent yet touching story about one boy's search for respect and ultimately ends up worse off in his search for it. It has a somewhat confusing storyline for those who aren't imtelligent enough to understand that this is not a huge gore fest the story has a much darker tone to it than most anime films always keeping you in dread and yet manages to have a little guilty humor as well. With voice actors from trigun and other famous anime voice actors Akira is not a movie to be watched by the feint of heart. It however is an anime classic and a must see for those who wish to see something different other than the little kid stuff like pokemon or yugi oh. I liked it bcause it was masterfully done has a good storyeline great action and leaves you on the edge of your seat.
B00003CXA4|5.0|I can't believe what some people think. <br />I understand that we all have our own personal opinion, but earlier in the reviews someone likened Mahatma Gandhi, nonviolent peace and freedom fighter, to an anorexic Paris Hilton.  That is impossible for me to understand.  Just how are Paris Hilton and Gandhi alike?   <br /> <br />Additionally, that review also stated that Gandhi had no point.  Hmm, let's see.  What happened as a result of Gandhi's fasting and walk to the sea?  Freedom for the entire Indian subcontinent!  I can understand criticism of the cinematography, photography, and other details (which in this movie were excellent), but I can't grasp the reviewer's point.  Perhaps freedom for an entire subcontinent is only as important as racy entertainment (if not less important).  Only Time will tell. <br /> <br />-Concerned Observer
B0000019PA|5.0|I don't know why, but when I first heard this album, I thought Neutral Milk Hotel was a one man band.  The lyrics have such an intensly strange intimacy about them, and a sound that is at once clunky and booming--I could fully imagine some lone guy standing on stage with instruments strapped to every part of his body, belting out songs in a nasal, reedy voice with nothing even close to self-consiousness.  I also thought Jeff Magnum, the singer/songwriter, was Scottish.   <br /> <br />Regardless of my inital misconceptions, there is a magic about this album that is apparent from the first time you hear it.  The images Magnum uses in his lyrics are twisted and evocative, spiraling the listener out of the everyday and into some large and fantastic vision of the universe.  The music behind the words are epic in their way, much like the words themselves.  Each instrument remains a seperate entity, never quite blending with each other, but somehow this only increases the power of the songs.    <br /> <br />The genres that could be used to categorize this album range from acoustic folk to full-on rock, but as a whole it doesn't fit into either label.  Like the brains behind it, its an odd duck, but in a way that, if you're open to it, is absolutely wonderful.   <br /> <br />(I'm afraid I'm not a very objective reviewer...)
1592400876|3.0|Being an admitted stickler when it comes to grammar, I thought I would devour this book. Unfortunately, it never really &quot;took off&quot; for me and I abandoned it after only a couple of chapters.

B000002UAO|5.0|This is my favourite album of all time. A Folk Rock masterpiece, with a lot of innovation. Just looking to the strange cover art you know The Beatles were into something new. The record shines especially because of the six classic tunes (all of them included in the Red Album collection): &quot;Drive My Car&quot; is a perfect opener, the most rocker song of the album; John's &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; is maybe the highest point, with the first use of a sitar (played by George) in a rock record; &quot;Nowhere Man&quot; is about lonelyness, with very introspective lyrics written by John and some of the best harmonies by The Beatles ever; &quot;Michelle&quot; is the Paul's inmortal ballad of the album, an instant classic; &quot;Girl&quot; is a John's worderful acoustic song; and &quot;In My Life&quot; is maybe the best John's love song ever, with a delicious double-speed piano played by producer George Martin. But there is more first rate material in the album. One of my favourite songs is &quot;The Word&quot;, a song about Universal Love, with colorful lyrics written two years before the Summer of Love. Paul's &quot;You Won't See Me&quot; and &quot;I'm Looking Through You&quot; are about boy-girl relationships, but they are mostly anti-love songs. And George's two songs of the album (&quot;Think For Yourself&quot;, with Paul on fuzz bass, and the Byrd-ish &quot;If I Needed Someone&quot;) are among the best songs he ever wrote (in fact both of them were included in the collection &quot;The Best Of George Harrison&quot;). Finally, Ringo's percussion is excellent everywhere. Don't miss this album if you like the mid-60's rock!
0393317552|5.0|Hands down, this is one of the best books I have ever read. I learned so much--I feel like I have taken a college course in my spare time. My views about the world has definitely been enhanced because of this book. Believe it or not, I became a bit more forgiving about people, specifically on what the seemingly &quot;more powerful&quot; have done to the &quot;oppressed.&quot; Don't get me wrong, I am not defending the &quot;colonizers&quot; or anything... It is just after reading this book, one realizes the micro and macro aspects of things. Example: what the more aggressive Polynesian population have done to their less advanced neighboring islands is similar to what the Europeans have done to the Native Americans of the U.S (not exactly but one can see some parallels). It is just a matter of scale in a lot of ways.      I know, this is just one person's point of view (a good one mind you) and many can dispute Jared's Diamond's claims--I can't blame them, they can seem too pc and one-sided. However, so far, &quot;Guns, Germs and Steel&quot; beats most of the Eurocentric books I read in high school and to some degree, in college. As a Filipino Amercian, I finally feel that my ancestor's history is included in a somewhat mainstream history book. It's about time and now for some more...
0440418569|4.0|This is the third and last book in the His Dark Materials trilogy (after Northern Lights, or The Golden Compass in the US,  and The Subtle Knife).<br />This volume starts just where the previous left off: after the conflagration on the hills near Citt&agrave;gazze, Lyra is nowhere to be found. Looking for her, Will meets two Angels, Balthamos and Baruch, who urge him to bring the Subtle Knife to Lord Asriel. He promises to help them, as soon as he's recued Lyra.<br />Lyra is actually in another world, where Mrs. Coulter is keeping her asleep with drugs, and telling the local population that she's a holy woman and that she's trying to heal Lyra, so as to be left alone and unquestioned. Soon though, with the help of a little village girl named Ama and of two tiny spies in the service of Lord Asriel, Gallivespians known as the Chevalier Tialys and the Lady Salmakia, Will finds her again and saves her.<br />But now the most dangerous part of the journey begins, because both children want to go to the Land of the Dead, to make amends and try to rescue Roger and Will's father.<br />As for Dr. Mary Malone, who crossed into Citt&agrave;gazze and then in yet another world, she meets a strange people called the Mulefa. Living with them for some time, she finally learns their language, make friends and discover they also know about sraf, the Shadow particles she was studying in her laboratory, or what Lyra calls Dust. She'll build a spyglass to see sraf and understansd its purpose.<br />Meanwhile, Father Gomez, an emissary of the Church, is on a Holy mission to kill Lyra, to prevent her from committing the original sin again.<br />I still don't know what to think of these books. The story is sometimes very moving, with some heart-wrenching passages, but the rest is sometimes dull and not very believable. I didn't think this final book tied up all loose ends either. It was enjoyable, but I wouldn't call hid Dark Materials my favourite series.
B00005LOLD|5.0|I can only nod my head in agreement with the other reviewers who have lauded this film.  It is beautifully filmed, well-written, and turns out suberb performances by Red Buttons, Miyoshi Umeki, Miiko Taka, James Garner, and especially Brando.  I highly recommend this DVD to anyone looking for a beautiful love story that is heartwrenching and inspiring and provides a lesson in the infinite power of love--a power that transcends all barriers.
B000294SFW|5.0|I have to admit I am a late starter when it comes to Motorhead. Apart from hearing a couple of tracks over the years (Ace of Spades and Bomber), I am a Motorhead Virgin. <br />  <br />WHAT HAVE I BEEN MISSING?!! This is superb! After becoming a bit disillusioned with so much rubbish that is being released lately I though I would try Inferno...desperately hoping that it was just simple headbanging rock and roll.. BY GOD this delivers! <br />  <br />The first track 'Terminal Show' is a blinder- just sets the tone immediately..you know what you are going to get!! 11 Tracks of stomping metal/rock - simple, yet addictively good. Plus an excellent blues track at the end. Shows that Lemmy can turn his hand to most things. <br />  <br />Motorhead are a vastly under-rated band - a crime really, as their back catalogue (I am now a convert!) is full of excellent albums. Lemmy is the ultimate rock anti-hero - just slings his bass on and gets on with it, none of your posturing or theatrics. The band as a whole are tight, with excellent catchy riffs, great guitar work and fantastic drums. Steve Vai guests on a couple of tracks and just follows the band's lead and gets down and dirty! <br />  <br />Altogether now...Motorhead ARE the Daddies!! You need this album in your collection...full stop..no questions...Don't think, just do it!!
0156027321|5.0|Just hearing that M. Night Shyamalan is going to direct the film version of this amazing novel. Please let him not screw it up like he has everything else. This is a brilliant, imaginative novel. I can't see how making it into a movie will do anyone any good.
B00005LQ04|5.0|In my opinion this is the finest horror film of all time. I love all of Dario Argento's films but this is my favorite. The murder scene early in the film has never been topped. This has the most original and intense soundtrack you will ever hear. You need to turn this up LOUD. I love to go down to my basement and put this on with all the lights out and the movie cranked up. I can scare the crap out of myself and it's GREAT. I know a lot of people are put off with foreign films because of the dubbing but I cannot imagine anyone who is into horror movies not loving this.
0553260111|5.0|I know, this book deserves a review all on its own merits - but let me speak first to the fact that the movie released last year with Matt Damon just simply did not do this book justice. What they did was take a compelling character, extract him from the plotline which makes him so compelling, and build a movie around him. If you thought Jason Bourne was a bad-ass character in this movie, and you enjoyed the pace and action of the movie - well, you have only begun to tap into the true excitement of Jason Bourne as he is in Ludlum's novel. I think the movie took Jason out of context to make him more current - as the book was originally published in 1987 and some of its politics and settings are dated. But I would argue that rather than dating the story, these facts lend a strong sense of time and place to the story that actually helps recommend it - and aid its mystery. <br /> <br />The initial plot of the movie - a man waking up amnesiac after being shot and left for dead in the Mediterranean Sea - is the same. And it is true, that man must seek knowledge of himself to explain his extraordinary abilities - in hand-to-hand combat, weapons assembly, language, and espionage. But what is not communicated so well in the movie is the true anguish and self-examination that must be undertaken by the Bourne character - what drives him unstoppably to determine who he is. Bourne is not a fierce killer - and yet can kill fiercely. There is a strong mystery and a burning need in him to find the truth - as a reader, you feel strongly attached and sympathetic to Bourne - mostly through the device of Marie, a much stronger character than in the movie - who is his partner in determining his identity. <br /> <br />Not only is he being pursued by his own intelligence agency - which subplot contains infinitely more subtlety than in the movie - but he is being tracked by the world's deadliest assassin as well - Carlos the Jackal - who is, all evidence seems to show, his fierce rival. Ashe circles in on Carlos, Carlos is circling in on him - and so is worldwide intelligence. Jason must determine who he is and what his past is - and has only so much time to do it - this sets the driving pace of the book. <br /> <br />Ultimately, what we have is a three-part cat and mouse game, with Jason always just one step ahead of everyone else. Is he an assassin? Is he an undercover agent whose cover is so deep he can't differentiate himself from it anymore? There is no time or luxury to decide - the novel moves along at a breakneck speed until we ultimately find out - almost too late - what the Bourne Identity truly is. <br /> <br />This book far exceeds the movie based on it because of its tightly drawn characters, far superior plot, and the truly deft way that Ludlum has woven his story into world politics and great international locations. Ludlum is a great writer of thrillers - as his decades of book sales attest - I would urge you to pick up this book and give it a weekend - it will reward you far beyond the 2 hours you got out of the movie.
B00005V0X5|5.0|For those who dont know or are new to Megadeth this is their 1st album. In my opinion i thought this ablum was awesome, except the song \\"these boots.\\" anyway heres how it stands for me.       Last Rites/Loved To Deth- 9/10 a great opener      Killing Is My Business...And Business Is Good!10/10 Not a very long song but the sick guitar work makes up for it.       The Skull Beneath The Skin- 9/10 Very nice solos by Dave Mustaine.       Rattlehead- 9/10 Nice solos from both Chris Poland, and Dave Mustaine.       Chosen Ones- 11/10! This song is 1 of my favorite songs ever. The lyrics are awesome, and Dave Mustaines solos are too. As well as Their bassist David Ellefson does a nice bass solo too.       Looking Down The Cross- 11/10! My other favorite song on the album.More great lyrics, and more crazy Dave Mustaine solos.       Mechanix- 10/10 If anyone has heard and liked the song \\"The 4 horsemen\\" by metallica, you'll like this song too. Its the same thing pretty much just 2 times faster and better. (Plus Dave Mustaine wrote both versoins anyway so it doesnt matter)       These Boots- 5/10 The reason i dont like this song is becuase of all the blips that mark out the lyrics cause of the original writer Lee Hazelwood. Other than the blips its a good song though.       The bonus tracks are ok too, but i hate reading and writing so i'll just stop here.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|How can you label as crap a band on being repetitive? And quit saying Jet has no talent. They have a lot of talent. Sure &quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl?&quot; was pretty much the same thing over and over again, but every band that is popular at the moment (whether you like it or not) does the same thing over and over and over and over until they're old, forgotten about, and either on more drugs or finally given up. Bands like AC/DC were repetitive and still have the same style as they did 25 years ago... they were huge. Every damn song is the same. But they must have been doing something right. Today's teens and their precious Rap, Techno that's no better than porn music, and POP CRAP are the same way. And THANK GOD the boy-band craze is over. Face it. Almost every famous band never ever changes in the style of their song writing or their playing without losing their fans and fading out of existence. The world has not seen a band that truly changed style and remained famous since The Beatles. Jet is a good band because they remind me of the bands from the good musical eras. Late 60's to now (skipping the worst musical periods of 1983-1997) with The Beatles, The Who, AC/DC, Pink Floyd, Aerosmith, The Strokes, The Vines, and even a little southern-blues rock with The White Stripes and CCR (plus a small hint of Cake and the Foo Fighters). But that large run on of a sentence will not convince the easily distracted and mislead people of today. Most of today's youth do not even appreciate anything from before the last MUSICAL FAD. Hell, the most famous stars today do not even write or play their own music. Some person no one knows sits down, pukes out songs, and doesn't get any credit for it. I am a music composer/performer myself and I think that if the public wasn't the flock of sheep lead by the shallow media shepherds, they wouldn't have useless noise posing as music shoved down their throats and more bands like Jet would be famous. More musical genres would be recognized and there would be musical balance. Blues, Bluegrass, Foreign and American Folk, Funk, Classic Rock, Swing, Jazz, and Real country (not that contemporary stuff with the posers who have never even seen a cow in real life), and other various downtrodden musical types would be just as big as rap and other pop... which seems like it is the only thing played on the radio anymore. It would probably even be easier for local bands to make it big. Hell, even Disco would come back. And don't even think that Jet blows because you're using a stereotype of a &quot;garage band&quot;. But think about it, EVERY BAND WAS A GARAGE BAND! Where else are they going to play but the basement? It just aggravates me to hear such bad reviews for a good band that everyone I know thinks is good. So I could go on and on about this and piss more people off but I still have just a little bit more. Firstly, if they suck so much, how come I hear &quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl&quot; and &quot;Cold Hard Bitch&quot; so much on the radio? Secondly, stop being blinded by media executives and not believe what everyone else said and be more open-minded. And Last... I am sure this long string of words was annoying and most people probably have stopped reading by now, but I want you to keep in mind what I have said about stereotyping new bands and think twice about them. Especially if you are in a band struggling to get gigs and make money. So, leave good bands like Jet alone and go write a review for a band or group that actually does really blow you blood-sucking naysayers. And don't give five stars on a review if you are going to completely bash a band... you know who you are. So in the words of Jack Black in Tenacious D, \\"YOU'RE ALWAYS NAYSAYING! SIT IN YOUR TOWER!\\" If you don't like it, go write your own damn music and we'll see who truly has less musical talent.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|INCREDIBLE! This movie is truely outstanding. Some may find it disturbing; I know I was freaked out when it ended. There are so many unforgettable images and scenes that will forever stick with you. If you're someone whos interested in &quot;experimenting&quot; with some drugs, watch this movie and then make your decision. Definitely a one to own.
B000002GJH|5.0|This is a fantastic album because it wasn't made to be put out and then toured in support of or to make Temple of the Dog superstars. This album was made for the sake of making music, it was in memory of Andrew Wood the late frontman of Mother Love Bone. Andrew's loss was so much to Chris Cornell, Jeff Ament, and Stone Gossard that they decided to get together in tribute for him. They all shared the same pain and most of that loss and frustration is put into these songs, but is therapy to them, they needed to get it all out. Even though this is mostly Chris' album Matt Cameron from Soundgarden(at the time)and Mike McCready come in to complete the lineup. Eddie Vedder has a guest spot on a few songs and he would go on with Mike, Jeff, and Stone to complete Pearl Jam, known at the time as Mookie Blaylock, who would've known this album would be history in the making? I won't point out tracks and say their good points because I think this album should be listened to as a whole instead of the singles. To sum up Jeff's message in the album sleeve, &quot;Real Music. NO Analyzing. No Pressure. No Hype. Just music to make music. Friends and a reason. Chemistry. Beauty. Life Rules!!&quot; I think that jeff pretty much summed this album up, now you have to buy it and feel exactly what they were feeling.
6302293553|4.0|There are so many things about this (and indeed any) Monty Python movie that one hardly knows where to begin. Nothing is left out of the mix--history, religion, politics, personal relationships, prejudices, intellectual prowess or the lack thereof. My title, of course, comes from an early scene in with Arthur approaches a castle, inexplicably occupied by French k-nigits, who claim to already have a grail.<br /><br />The Monty Python troupe, led by the creative talents of Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones, incorporated John Cleese, Michael Palin, Eric Idle and Graham Chapman as King Arthur, the dominant role in the film.  No animals were harmed in the filming, not even an African Swallow, non-migratory as they are.  A few coconuts bit the dust, however, as did more than a few comic images.  Logic bits the dust, too, on more than one occasion.  I did a paper once for symbolic logic which I was told ten years later was still being passed about because I had dared to use something so unconventional as this Monty Python movie in the references (I couldn't see why that wouldn't be much more common, and indeed, hope it is today--I use 'Life of Brian' in homilies, so why not this film in logic?).<br /><br />The particular logical incident (or rather, illogical incident) involves the trial of a woman accused of being a witch. Through 'logic' it is demonstrated that she would be a witch if she weighed the same as a duck (which, surprisingly enough, it turns out that she does -- 'It's a fair cop' she concedes as the general rejoicing commences at the prospect of a bonfire).  Those who have benefit of the 'Executive Version of the Soundtrack of the Trailer of the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail' are also treated to an exposition of the logical problems which itself concludes that 'sex is better than logic'. And who could argue with that reasoning?<br /><br />However, my favourite scene would have to be the liturgical procession and reading of instructions for the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch, with the leader's instruction 'skip a bit, brother' -- an instruction which I've searched in vain in the liturgical handbooks, but would vastly improve many readings on some mornings in church. This is a perfect parody of the sonorous but deadening readings that seem to drag on interminably.<br /><br />A close second would be the scene in which Arthur tries to explain his kingship to members of an autonomous collective (read, peasants without a lord) who view him as just another oppressor, and inform him that watery tarts throwing swords at you is not an adequate basis for the exercise of supreme executive power.<br /><br />Those who have visions of Great Britain as royal and cultural icons are often amazed-the likes of Monty Python and Benny Hill (among others) show the inhabitants of the UK as just as human (if not moreso) than the rest of the world. And we are all the richer for it.  Alas, the Holy Grail is never actually attained by the seekers, who run into trouble with more French k-nigits and the local constabulary. But, the journey's the thing, so they teach me in seminary, and thus, this journey is well worth following to the end.<br /><br />The DVD comes with many extras, including the Camelot song being sung by Lego-land figures, and extensive commentary by actors and others involved in the production.<br /><br />Prepare to be amazed! Prepare to be offended! Prepare the popcorn in advance.Hand Grenade of Antioch, with the leader's instruction 'skip a bit, brother' -- an instruction which I've searched in vain in the liturgical handbooks, but would vastly improve many readings on some mornings in church.

0792838068|5.0|A previous review proclaimed this movie as &quot;a complete downer&quot;. Yes, it is. It is a reverse fairy tale, a purely fictional account of the ravages of depression, addiction, and desperation. Las Vegas is the obvious setting for such a story of accepted destruction, and Mike Figgis keenly uses the glimmer and glitz of Vegas as an underlying contradiction throughout the whole movie. <br /> Nic Cage finds the only way to live his life, by drinking himself to death. He falls in with Sera, played by Elisabeth Shue, who only knows one way to live her life, by being a prostitue. Their timid steps toward the middle ground of dysfuntion and their eventual acceptance of each other is the high point of the movie. The ending is as appropriately depressing as was built up during the rest of the film, but would it make sense any other way? Ben in AA and Sera selling cars instead of herself?  <br /> It amazes me how many people can watch a movie about the foibles of the human condition (comparable movies: The Ice Storm, The Sweet Hereafter, American Beauty, The Night Porter) and be depressed! You must leave the experience happy! You must walk out of that theater feeling strong and in control! If your life is in such dire staits as the people on the screen, well, I feel sorry for you. However, I feel that most of you are okay, and by watching Leaving Las Vegas, you should feel ecstatic that you aren't a drunk, a prostitute, or dead! These characters found happiness, if only for a brief while, why can't you. There is hope!  <br /> An excellent script portrayed by excellent actors and shot by a director who put his soul into the piece. A downer, yes, I will admit to that, but a little thought and a little perspective shows you a great movie, one that should not be missed.
B00008EY65|5.0|Hellboy is easily better than Spiderman 2!! They both had the action, the romance, and the comic relief (actually, spiderman dint have that), but Hellboy was never slow. It kept you hooked throughout the whole movie. The action scenes were incredible and there was always alot of suspense!!! This is a definite buy!!! And if you like these kinds of movies check out Van Helsing!!!
B00014K5TQ|4.0|Good movie capturing the maddness of early 90s club culture.
B0002KVUKM|5.0|Obviously this movie got mixed reviews. Either viewers loved or hated it. I cannot understand the hate. First of all, this was a typical Stephen Sommers film - you take a film classic and remake it with sarcasm, better effects, and you poke fun at the campiness of it all. Apparently some people were expecting something more gothic, or serious, or historically accurate. Well, guess what? That has been done to death - no pun intended. What Sommers does here is far more entertaining: he takes these great characters of European Folklore, and he attempts create a nineteenth century world where they actually live, and attempt to intermingle with civilization. It's an amusing concept, or like Dracula says \\"Why can't people just leave us alone? We never kill more than our share!\\" I think, actually, the humor in this film and its actual folkloric parallels may have been over the heads of many viewers. Based on the reviews, those that hated it obviously did not understand or grasp the humor. I do feel that this film presents the best performance of a Dracula character. No, he is not a brooding gothic figure, rather he is an egotistical, sarcastic, obviously flawed individual whose eternal life in the dark fog of Transylvania is beginning to get to him. Bravo to Richard Roxburgh for his treatment of this character! Anyway, if you enjoy a higher-developed dry sense of humor coupled with parodies of folklore (or have any back ground in the actual myths regarding the characters of this film) then you will truly enjoy this film. Mind you, the action scenes stretch the bounds of reality, but then again, so does the existence of a were-wolf, or the Frankenstein Monster. I do enjoy the exchange between Dracula and the were-wolf, who in the form of a man is a noble chivalrous soul, and upon hearing of Dracula's plans declares that he would \\"rather die!\\" Dracula's response? \\"Oh, don't be boring. Everyone who says that dies.\\" Enjoy!!!
B000286S8S|3.0|First of all I cant believe how much they want for this on TV and other places. I went to my local Best Buy and paid what this album is really worth. I have read many reviews on this site and agree with most of them. Die hard fans should stick with the albums they like and new fans buy BOBW's. How can they get away with the flawed ending on &quot;Finish what you started&quot;?! Also the repeating three live DLR songs sung by SH should have been swapped for leftouts. VH should have saved the three new songs for their next album (more money for VH).
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|When they released their self-titled debut album in the UK in January 2004, Franz Ferdinand were hailed as the first great new band of the year. Unbelievable hype swirled around the new Scottish four-piece as they burst into the charts with their unmistakable debut. Their debut single garnered many pleasing reviews and made the band one of the most talked about of the year. With heavy-guitars and loveable beats, this is essentially post-pop melodic fun with hints of rock from the punk scene - all mashed together in a rebellious, yet fun-loving, way. The album itself doesn't even manage to make the 40 minute mark, clocking in at 38:49, yet with this album it is definitely more quality over quantity.<br /><br /> Franz Ferdinand have made an impact because they are different from anything else out there. Their beats are repetitive, yes, and their lyrics are simplistic, but it's the way the band are 'marketed', and I use that word lightly, because they are definitely not a manufactured band. They're outrageously camp, eccentric and very geeky - the kind of music you could imagine the high school nerds rocking to, but secretly love yourself. The music is a revelation, and behind that bland and boring, uninspired black album cover lies of a cracking album just waiting to jump into your CD player...<br /><br /> The album opens with &quot;Jacqueline.&quot; The song opens softly with a light guitar and the vocals of the lead singer. After around forty seconds the beat kicks in and soon begins a brilliant fast-paced rocker with a definite retro theme. Following this is the excellent &quot;Tell Her Tonight.&quot; With David Bowie-like vocals, the band sing about a girl who must be informed of something - the 'something' is rather ambiguous, however, making you think what it could be in the verses. The band's debut single is up next, &quot;Take Me Out,&quot; which made it to No.3 in the UK. The song opens loudly and the beat soon kicks in, only to slow down steadily until the soon-to-be-British-anthem bass kicks in around the 55th second. This is by far the greatest footstomper of the year and an awesome hand-clapper! The lyrics are bright and vibrant, as are the vocals and the entire composition - absolute masterpiece!<br /><br /> &quot;The Dark Of The Matinee&quot; is up next and was the second single to be taken from the album. In this song, the band sing of meeting a girl in the matinee. It's very old fashioned in style, but the music is bang up to date and fresh: &quot;Find me and follow me, through corridors, refectories and files you must follow, leave this academic factory, you will find me in the Matinee, the dark of the matinee! It's better in the Matinee, the dark of the Matinee! It's mine, yes it's mine!&quot; The next song is &quot;Auf Achse&quot; which is a great song with a brilliant one-minute musical intro, before the singing starts. The song sings of wanting a girl bad style, but not being able to have her. So near yet so far away! &quot;Cheating On You&quot; begins like some 60's-psychedelia song that you'd hear in Austin Powers! The lyrics are once again repetitive, but who cares when you can nod your head this hard?! &quot;This Fire&quot; is a rather disappointing song that doesn't quite match the others on this album, but is enjoyable nonetheless. &quot;Darts Of Pleasure&quot; is another lyrically repetitive song, yet it has a pleasurable-enough beat to keep afloat.<br /><br /> &quot;Michael&quot; is the third single to be released from the album and has to be a definite album highlight! This is like the true gay anthem of the year! It really is superbly produced and very humorous. The boys sing about Michael, a beautiful boy on a beautiful dancefloor. He has leather hips, sticky lips, and is the most-wanted guy to dance with! The determination in the song is what makes it so hilarious, and it's good to see the band singing about a topic that would make other so-called 'respectable' artists criticised. &quot;Come OnHome&quot; has a brilliant and very catchy beat to start off with and continues this through the remainder of the song. The song is similar to the rest on the album, and it might be difficult to distinguish it from the others to begin with, yet over time with repeated listens, you'll grow to love this as an album highlight! The album closes with &quot;40'&quot; which is a rather unusual song compared to the rest on the album. It has a singular beat running all the way through it, which is very catchy, along with the &quot;Lalala&quot; bit!<br /><br /> OVERALL GRADE: 9/10<br /><br /> Franz Ferdinand have certainly created a unique debut album here, which has just picked up a Mercury Music Prize nomination in the UK, and is tipped to win in September. There are a few dull moments on this album, I won't lie, but the good parts far outweigh these. The band at this stage in their careers are in desperate need of progression and development if they are to survive for a long time. They can't carry on making music that is similar to this, as I feel the public would get bored and simply desert them. I look forward to the sophomore album, as it will be interesting to see what they come up with.uot;Come On Home&quot; has a brilliant and very catchy beat to start off with and continues this through the remainder of the song.

B000000WA4|5.0|Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness accomplishes a rare feat: it leads the listener through a 28 song extravaganza without waxing redundent and with little or no filler, in my opinion. This very impressive two disc effort showcases the true inventiveness that has made a name for the Pumpkins even to this day. The sheer variety of styles must be mentioned, and the just plain catchiness as well. Almost each song is worth a listen, which can't be said for many albums, especially two disc sets. <br /> Billy's voice is nasel, as expected, although I personally find this an asset to the music, rather than a setback. <br /> Although not as important, the art direction for the liner notes is whimsical and interesting, another typical SP trademark of quality. <br /> If you like 90s alternative and some more melodic grunge, then definetly buy this album. Although the price may be a bit steep, I would say it's worth it b/c of the musical quality and beautiful cover and liner notes art direction. And if you must be cheap, at least order it from your local library. I won't lie, that's what I did. Whoops, just revealed an anti-corporate secret. <br /> Anywho, as a closing note, Mellon Collie is a darn good album because it just is very beautiful. For all you lazy folks, here are my top 8 most favorite songs on the album: Tonight Tonight (I know we've all heard it 10 billion times, but, darn, it's just so frickin' beautiful), An Ode to No One (I'll never be the shine in your spit is my new motto), Muzzle, 1979, Tales of a Scorched Earth (kind of a punkish or hardcore vibe, takes some getting used to), XYU (a rather harsh and abrasive song with semi-disturbing lyrics), Lily (a nice, light-hearted ditty one can sway along with) and Farewell and Goodnight, a haunting dessert to the scrumpous Pumpkin soup. Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness (the song), Jellybelly, Zero, Bullet with Butterfly Wings, Galapogos, Porcelina of the Vast Oceans, Where Boys Fear to Tread, Bodies, Thirty-Three, We Only Come out at Night and Beautiful are not too bad either. Just get the CD, you won't be sorry. I'm not crazy, I promise. <br /> <br /> <br />

B00005JMYG|2.0|I went to this movie with mediocre expectations, and was disappointed. There were a few laughs, but half way through the movie I found myself wondering if there were not a better place to be spending my time. Another SNL skit turned to movie length when it deserved 10 minutes.
B00005MP58|5.0|What can I say?  6 hours just flies by when I watch this movie.  I like having the DVD because then I don't have to change tapes so often, even if the quality is poor.  However, this way I can't skip tape two so easily.  (I don't like Mr. Collins)  Of course the brilliance of the novel cannot be transposed without some changes.  That's all.
B000267JQK|5.0|THESE GUYS KICK ASSS AND THEY ARE SOUTH AFRICA SO HA HA HA TO ALL THE &quot;COOL&quot; AMERICAN BANDS
B000089RVX|1.0|I'm sick of seeing positive reviews for this CD. You're all lying and you know it! One guy said My Immortal made him cry, and a lot of people say it's depressing-Well I gueese you guys havn't heard of \\"Daddy\\" and \\"Kill You\\" by Korn, \\"Klavier(Piano)\\" by Rammstein, etc. When I heard my Immortal I did NOT fell any sad-like feelings. And a lot of people say Amy Lee is an awesome singer. Well, I bet anyone who said that hasn't heard of Cristina Scabbia (Lacuna Coil), Anne (i forget her last name) (The Gathering), etc., etc. I mean these girls make her look like she should stick to Kareoke! And finally alot of poeple say that Ev is the best band in the world...it's sad. I bet they haven't heard of Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, Kiss, Aerosmith, Metallica, TooL, Guns 'N Roses, Rolling Stones, Queen, Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, etc. I mean these bands make Ev seem like crap!!! Now I give it 1 star!!!!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! All the songs suck!!!!! I wish I could give this -500 srats. C'mon, join the Evanescence bashing wagon-it's fun! Now I will end this review by recommending the following bands for good music:<br /> Death<br /> Slayer<br /> Metallica(old)<br /> Guns 'N Roses<br /> Ozzy Osbourne/Black Sabbath<br /> Opeth<br /> Danzig<br /> Machine Head<br /> Nothingface<br /> etc.,etc.,etc.,etc.,etc.,etc.,etc.<br /><br />This review will probably get a \\"4 of 300\\" helpful rating, but that's not what's important. What's important is that I wrote an intelligent review instead of just saying \\"Evaenescence sucz ass!!1!!\\"<br /><br /> I'm done here.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Tarantino teams with Uma Thurman to invent one of the coolest characters I think I have ever seen in any movie to date. 2003's &quot;Kill Bill&quot; is one of the best films of this year if not of all-time and it's a damn shame that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences is too conservative to realize how great it is.<br /><br /> Uma Thurman stars as &quot;The Bride&quot; (her real name is actually bleeped out whenever it's uttered) and she's pissed as hell. She is a former assassin apparently on the verge of getting married after running away to restart her life after discovering that she is carrying her boss's baby...only her boss, &quot;Bill&quot; (David Carridine) finds out and sends her former teammates to gun her down at the chapel...but wait, that's just the beginning of the story. And it's brilliantly retold, short and to the point, in a grainy black-and-white two-minute sequence at the film's introduction. Bill is yet to be revealed. All we hear is his voice; soothing, yet dark and foreboding...and all we can see is The Bride's pained face as she lies on the floor, sweating profusely and bleeding to death. She tries to tell Bill that she is pregnant with his child and it's cut off by a bullet to her head.<br /><br /> If you are trying to make sense of anything I have told you thus far, don't. If you think I've given too much away, I haven't. You see, The Bride WILL kill everyone she has set out to kill because that's her motivation. Thurman's character is practically invincible with the skills of the greatest martial arts fighter in the world and the momentum of a Mac truck. It's HOW she kills that provides you with surprise and suspense. And if you're thinking that this is a self-indulgent gore-fest with no plot, you're very much incorrect.<br /><br /> The Bride is smart and cunning and you identify with her cause. More so, I would imagine, if you were a woman watching this movie. In fact, you can't call Tarantino sexist or mysoginist because almost every female character he writes is intelligent (save for Bridget Fonda's character in Jackie Brown, but Tarantino adapted the character from the book, so that doesn't count) and has the ability to play on the same field as men. In fact, Bill's entire staff of killers, save for Budd, is a female so, technically, this is a chick flick but a chick flick lovingly dedicated to a group of women with their arms held aloft with pride and conviction and Uma leading the charge with a sharp sword and a bad attitude.<br /><br /> Like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, this movie is presented in &quot;chapters&quot;, making it feel like you're watching a great epic novel come to life in front of your eyes. Each chapter introduces a character, or a backstory told in different types of media. A few examples of this: The Bride's death is recorded in black-and-white as if you are watching history unfold, O-Ren Ishii's twisted origin is Japanese hardcore hentai anime, and characters fight in silhouette against giant screens that, at once, turn red, then blue.<br /><br /> These are truly epic moments told with truly epic style and fashion with giant doses of wit and flair added for good measure. An example is one of my favorite exchanges in the film is between The Bride and O-Ren after The Bride has mowed down O-Ren's gang of fighters (nicknamed &quot;The Crazy 88&quot;):<br /><br /> O-Ren: &quot;Silly caucasian girl likes to play with samurai swords. You didn't think it would be that easy did you?&quot;<br /><br /> The Bride: &quot;Actually, for a second there...yeah...I kinda did.&quot;<br /><br /> O-Ren: &quot;Silly Rabbit...&quot;<br /><br /> The Bride and O-Ren (at the same time): &quot;Tricks are for kids...&quot;<br /><br /> Or the soft-spoken and very solemn bragging coming from master swordmaker, Hatori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba of &quot;The Street Fighter&quot;, one of Tarantino's favorite martial-arts films):<br /><br /> Hanzo: &quot;This is my finest sword. Should you encounter God in your travels, God will be cut.&quot;<br /><br /> The humor injected into each scene makes the fights following them seem all the more deadly and enticing and dramatic. Swords ring and slice, knifes cut through the air, bullets boom, women spit venom into the word, &quot;b***h&quot; whenever they trash-talk, and the blood...oh, yes...I did forget to mention the gallons upon gallons of blood, didn't I? Violent? Well, I still defend this film against those who say that violence is only justified in films regarding religion, mainly because while this movie is violent, you're really not supposed to be taking it seriously. I find it hard to believe that when someone gets a belly-full of sword, then has that sword removed from their belly, that all the blood they carry flies forth as if the stab-victim has a pressurized water cannon readilly installed in their stomach. It's violent...but it's outrageously violent and in that way, that is where the movie gets its charm. Sure, it's pretty dark charm, but it's charm nonetheless.<br /><br /> The great amount of detail that Quentin Tarantino has applied to this film is unbelievable. He borrows from old Sergio Leone westerns, 60's martial-arts movies, action films, anime, and great sweeping dramas. The only genre that Tarantino leaves untouched is the movie-musical and science-fiction although, one would suspect that if Tarantino had enough time, he would cover those, too. I could almost imagine Tarantino ressurecting the acting career of Mark Hammill and casting him as a hip alien who tries to kill The Bride for killing Bill, a friend of his.<br /><br /> How good is it?<br /><br /> Remember that part in &quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico&quot; by Tarantino's good friend, Robert Rodriguez, when Johnny Depp tells Antonio Banderas that he is so crazy for the pork dish he is eating that when he is through, he is going to walk into the kitchen and shoot the cook?<br /><br /> Oh yes, it's that good, but I'm not shooting the cook 'cuz I want more.<br /><br /> **** out of ****<br /><br /> --Mattencounter God in your travels, God will be cut.&quot; <br />  <br /> The humor injected into each scene makes the fights following them seem all the more deadly and enticing and dramatic.

B000089RVX|4.0|a music fan from hawaii must of been singing along to the songs again. I only got it for the first 3 songs and I ended up listening to the rest of it later. all of the songs except for track 10 or 11 I think are good. My copy was stolen earlier this year so I'm going to pick up another. Amy Lee's voice is very smooth and very high, which is why the music fan from hawaii must of heard something dying..he/she/it couldnt reach the high notes. Anyways This CD owns.
B000063DFN|5.0|Iron Maiden is one of the best bands to influence the world of heavy metal. One thing that I admire about them is how they have stuck to their roots throughout their musical careers. The album, Powerslave, was the first cd of many that I have bought from these guys. From the moment that I heard the song, Aces High, I knew this was going to be a fun and awesome album to enjoy.<br /><br />  Aces High opens with great riffs and introduces the mood for the album. Following with the fan favorite, 2 Minutes to Midnight rocks and is also featured on 'Grand Theft Auto Vice City' on the rock station. I believe Iron Maiden has only done 2 instumentals. (forgive me if I'm wrong) The song, Losfer Words is one of them that is great! The best songs here in my opinion are Powerslave, and Rime of the Ancient Mariner, which is an epic song of massive proportions.<br /><br />  Though short in length (only 8 tracks) this album is filled with high-quality songs and this is some of Iron Maiden's best work. I highly recommend new fans to purchase this album first, and then 'Somewhere in Time.' I recently saw Iron Maiden in concert in Los Angeles in January for their Dance of Death tour. It was awesome, but, surprisingly, there were no songs from this album, which is considered by many fans to be their best. I still enjoyed the show with all of my heart, and I hope that Iron Maiden stay true to their roots like they did with Dance of Death. Finally, this album is just plainly a fun album to listen to and I am grateful that this was my first Iron Maiden album of many that I have enjoyed magnificantly.
B000002B2T|5.0|Layne knew his addiction was going to kill him. God he was so GREAT! Layne let us know he could sing in the Alice In Chains album entitled &quot;Facelift.&quot; Even then he knew his addiction would one day kill him. WHy else would you suppose he came up with the the Mad Season lyrics &quot;Slow suicide's no way to go.&quot; This is a tough world for sensitive, unique artists to live in. Buy EVERYTHING that has anything to do with this GOD!
B0001ZX0PG|4.0|This movie was disappointing because if the actors had tried a bit harder they would have produced an excellent work. They did well, but the finishing touch that would have made a classic wasn't there. The story is a tough one to put on screen as fully detailed as the book, but Eastwood still has a future. I'll see this movie again.
B0001Z53AQ|3.0|This CD shows D12's biggest problem: there are just too many of them in the group. Yes. there are really only six but they try to get eachother as much track time as possible and it really doesnt work as well as it could have. <br />  <br /> Dont get me wrong this is much better than Devil's Night, which really only sold cuz on Em. <br />  <br /> D12 world has a bunch of good cuts, from &quot;My Band&quot; and &quot;40oz&quot; to &quot;good die young&quot; and &quot;leave dat boy alone&quot;. These are all good songs but this CD really lacks any great tracks. If you compare this to an Em LP, the &quot;best&quot; songs on this are only as good as the &quot;aiight&quot; songs on his. <br />  <br /> My advice: give it a listen but save your money.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This is one of the first cds i bought, and ill tell ya it was really good. Eminem has some of the best lyrics ive heard. My favorite song on the album is &quot;The way i am&quot;. Go get this cd.
B000002U8G|5.0|Contained inside 'Meddle' is an exciting blend of blues, jazz, and that trademark Pink Floyd slow-rockish music, for lack of a better term. The main purpose of 'Pillow of Winds,' the album's second track, at least for me, is to calm down the listener from listening to 'One of these Days,' the track before it. After I listened to 'One of these Days,' I felt extraordinarily excited and pleasantly angry, almost the same way one feels after playing football. But then the soft fade into the next song calmed me down and nearly put me to sleep, just as I believe Pink Floyd intended it to be. The other songs had similar effects, PF clearly portrays their emotions throughout the album.  <br /> <br />All in all, a fantastic album, second to only Wish You Were Here in the list of Floyd albums.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|This movie did a good job of trying to include all of what was in the book, an impossible task. The historical value remains, the dialogue is adequate [except for the 'accent' Nicole Kidman pushed out]; the costumes were well done. Reading the book beforehand will give a viewer a ton of appreciation and understanding of the movie. The book without the movie would be more informative, but the movie without the book is well worthwhile [especially a short sequence for Natilie Portman fans].
0451125800|5.0|If you have watched and enjoyed the movies, then you will not be disappointed by the books (Luckily the movies that came from this book stayed true to the story). If you (for whatever insane reason) have not seen the movies you probably will still love this book. <br /> <br />This book is the story of the Corleone family and tells it with great skill. All parts of the book flow together to make a great page-turner. He spends the time making sure that you care and understand the characters and the family, itself. Making this NOT just another mob-story. Once drawn into the story, the plot and twists of the tale will keep you reading till the very last page. <br /> <br />Basically, this is a classic, whether or not you have enjoyed the movie.
0451196716|4.0|I just finished reading The Long Walk about ten minutes ago. I found this book to be captivating, intense, and creepy as hell. It's a book about the United States, run by a government that is only hinted at as being quite different from the one we know(Led by a man known only as &quot;The Major&quot; and policed by nefarious &quot;Squads&quot;). In this odd parallel universe, the national passtime is no longer the safe, sweet game of baseball but is instead replaced by an even known as The Long Walk, which is simply 100 boys under the age of 18 going on a walk. If any of the boys fall, stumble, leave the pathway, or walk under 4 miles per hour, they are given warnings. After three warnings, they are shot in the head. The walk ends when all but one boy has died. <br /> This story, while cryptic, provokes odd thoughts about life and death, about how far a body will be pushed by the mind just to continue survival, and about how unfair life truely is. Really a microcosm of what life is all about, The Long Walk shows friends being made and lost, bonds made and broken, about the fact that someday everyone you love will no longer be with you and the battles you fought to get where you are were nothing but a battle with yourself. <br /> This book is really great, but it still has a few problems; First, as a fan of 1984, I felt that the story skirts too much on the basic facts of how the government has changed or when and how it came about. Also, as a reader, you are tortured with the knowledge that no matter how fond you become of the characters, all but one of them is going to die. It is worth a read as most of King's books are, but if you want creepy and fulfilling without being scary, I'd recommend The Dead Zone or The Green Mile before recommending this book.

B000065KBZ|5.0|As a lover of classic films, this one tops them all.  <BR>I remember watching this as a child every Christmas and the tradition continued into my adulthood that I now share with my husband.<BR>A movie to really make you think and appreciate all that surrounds you - a fantastic &quot;glad to be alive&quot; message that is as powerful today as it was in 1947.<BR>I believe everyone should at least see it once....yes, it's an older movie and not quite up to par with what is produced today (with all the special effects and fast paced story lines, etc..), but it is worth the time in everyone's busy schedule to watch.
0553296981|5.0|Imagine that someday you are remembered for all eternity at a very particular time and at a very particular age. You could be remembered forever as being 25 on September the 11th or you could be remembered as being 44 when JFK was shot. It seems awfully cruel for someone to be remembered between the ages of 13 to 15. Do you remember what you were like at that age? Would you want anyone to think of you as that old for as long as your name is remembered? Such is the fate of Anne Frank. Now, I never read this book when I was young. High schools, in my experience, tend to assign the play version of this story when they want to convey Anne Frank's tale. Anne tends to be remembered as the little girl who once wrote, &quot;I still believe that people are really good at heart&quot; in spite of her sufferings. So I should be forgiven for expecting this book to be the dewy-eyed suppositions of a saintly little girl. Instead, I found someone with verve, complexity, and a personality that I did not always particularly like. What I discovered, was the true Anne Frank.<br /><br /> The diary of Anne begins when she is 13 years of age and the Jews are already wearing yellow stars in Amsterdam. Anne is your usual precocious girl, flirting with boys and being impudent when she can get away with it. When at last the time comes for the Franks to go into hiding (Margot Frank, Anne's sister, has been issued an order for her removal) they do so with another family, the Van Daans. In a small floor hidden above Otto Frank's old workplace the two families are aided by faithful friends and employees. Over the course of the diary we watch and listen through Anne's eyes as, for two years, the people in the attic are put through terrible deprivations and trials. There are good times and bad, but Anne is a singularly biased narrator and her observations must usually be taken with a grain of salt. After a while you become so comfortable with Anne's observations and voice that the final page of the narrative comes as a shock when the capture of Anne and her family is finally announced.<br /><br /> I recently had the mixed pleasure of finding and rereading my own diary from around the age of 14. After forcing myself to look through the occasional passage here and there I was forced to conclude that for her age, Anne is a marvelous writer. She has a sense of drama, tension, and narrative that is particularly enthralling. It's painful to think about what a great writer she could have been had she lived any longer. Honestly, the Anne I met in this book showed all the worst characteristics of her age. I found her detestation of her own mother to be particularly repugnant. Then I remembered... she's an early adolescent. Of course she hates her mother! Of course she's just simply awful a lot of the time. But you can see who she's becoming, and that's what makes the book so hard to get through. You can see her growth and her character. You know that she's learning and trying to understand what it means to be a human being during World War II. It's all the more awful that this would be the age she was preserved at.<br /><br /> The book is remarkable on so many levels. I think young teenage girls will understand Anne's plight intrinsically. Who couldn't? Who doesn't remember the rocky years of 13-15? The need for attention? The sobbing for no particular reason? By the end of the diary, Anne becomes far more philosophical. She no longer records the family's every move and action. Instead, she ponders questions like whether or not young people are lonelier than old people. Or what it means to be good. Though you may not like the protagonist of this book at all times, you come to understand and sympathize with her. She is a remarkable author, all the more so when you consider that this diary was written for her eyes alone at the time. If I could require kids to read something in school, I think this would top the list. It probably remains the best Holocaust children's book in existence today.k in existence today.
B0000027DJ|5.0|Alice combines what was great about 'Constrictor' & 'Raise Your Fist and Yell' with some of the elements from 'Trash'. Like 'Trash', 'Hey Stoopid' features some guest stars, Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, Ozzy, Slash and Joe Satriani. But unlike 'Trash' the guest performers have not taken control of the album, they are there simply to back Alice up. Alice's anti-drug message title track is fun and kicks the album off to a great start. But Alice really shines on the ballad's 'Love's a Loaded Gun' and 'Might As Well Be on Mars'. It's amazing listening to Alice's voice. It really hasn't changed much since the 'Love It To Death' days. Most of the songs on this disk are straight ahead heavy metal that Alice is known for. 'Feed My Frankenstein' was made famous by the 'Wayne's World' movie, and is one of the most clever songs Alice has written. The sexual innuendo is a riot. 'Snakebite' and 'Hurricane Years' are fun songs with chorus' that will keep running through your head. But the highlight of the album for me is the final song, 'Wind-up Toy'. 'Wind-up Toy' is about a Cooper character who resides in a mental institution and the last 30 seconds of the song are genuinely creepy. But what makes this a 5 star song is that once the music fades you hear the haunting little boy voice call out 'Steeeveen'. I love that Alice updated his fans on his creepy little boy/great big man character from 'Welcome to my Nightmare'. If you like 80's metal you should enjoy this disk, if you like Cooper but disliked 'Trash' and were afraid to commit to 'Hey Stoopid' don't worry, this is the Alice Cooper we have come to know and love.
0380002930|5.0|Hello again, dear reader. Once again it is I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone, Professor Emeritus of American Literature. What better book to study than a British book about rabbits (or &quot;Bun-Buns&quot;). Now, many of you foolish young scamps may be thinking &quot;Ho, that book can't be very interesting! Rabbits can't talk!&quot;. That just goes to show that I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone, am much more cunning and intelligent than you, a foolish stooge. These bun-buns are magical and can communicate almost as well as I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone! This, dear reader, is known to literary fellows like I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone, as &quot;Retention of Belief&quot;. Yes Yes. I first read this (excuse the witticism) novel novel (I'm sorry if you did not understand, dear reader, but than, I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone, am Professor Emeritus of American Literature, while you are a foolish heathen bumpkin) when I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone, was a youthful rogue of 50. My biddy had just punted me, Professor Emeritus Johnstone, from our formally cordial nuptial-bed (She had some notion about 'rights of the female' or some such nonsensical drivel--never fear dear reader, I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone, quickly put that to rest!) and I trudged down to the extra nest of quilts in the parlor. Unfortunately, the Lord our Maker did not see fit to give even I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone, peace! Tossing and turning, my keen, intelligent eyes fell upon a book with some form of mammalian creature on the cover. Having just finished the wonderful collegiate-edition book, &quot;The Rats of NIMH&quot;, I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone, was in a bit of mood for tales of woodland folk. But I digress.    So, a short synopsis of this story. I would recommed this manuscript for rambunctious misshaps between three and six years of age.   Watership Down: A Tale of Bun-Buns   A Novel Not Written by Professor Emeritus Johnstone because He Chooses To Pursue Other, Much More ImportantThings That A Foolish Novelist Could Never Comprehend.   1. A group of Bun-Buns leave the &quot;Warren (Funny that, as I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone, always thought Warren was a person!) because of a pigglety young squirt-of-a-rabbit who is undoubtedly in need of a good old-fashioned labotomy   2. A bun-bun named Hazel (a pseudonym for his real name, which is Walnut) takes charge, much like I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone would have done. Unfortunately this Bun-Bun seems to be a cad and bounder!   3. All the Bun-Buns die, for they are stooge-bun-buns and are no match for the might of humans.      And there you have it. I personally feel the title is rather nugatory (much like the writer in comparison to a Professor of American Literature). I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone, would have titled it more appropriately as &quot;Bun-Buns: Fact or Fiction?&quot; but alas, some foolish mortals like Mr. Adams will not listen to his betters.   Hark, I hear daylight approaching merrily down the lane! It is time for prayers and flaggelation! So until next time, dear readers, I wish you a luke-warm farewell.      --Yours, Etc.   Professor Emeritus Percy Q. Johnstone
B00008976Y|5.0|Although &quot;Red&quot; remains my favorite installment in the Three Colors trilogy, &quot;Blue&quot; is wonderful as well. Juliette Binoche plays a grief stricken woman attempting to cope with the sudden death of her husband and daughter. She is luminous in the role, and has the remarkable ability to tell us exactly what she is thinking through her expressions rather than saying anything at all. Her desire to leave her old life behind and start anew, anonymous, in Paris, is the desire for freedom from the past (the theme of the film is liberty; for &quot;Red,&quot; it's fraternity, and for &quot;White,&quot; equality).  <br />  <br /> As she comes to terms with her grief, some of her actions may be questionable and might make the audience look unsympathetically at her character, but Binoche always seems to somehow make us understand why she is doing what she does. <br />  <br /> The manner in which the color blue is used to bring mood and atmosphere to the film is also impressive. We see Julie swimming through a pool, the scene bathed in blues; there are also blue crystals, windows, balloons, a plethora of things blue, to underscore Julie's grief. <br />  <br /> I highly recommend this film, for its superb performances and its consideration of a woman handling grief the best way she knows how.
B00004Y7SF|4.0|The album has many of the same songs sung by the celeb list from A-Z from 1920-2004, but Christina does contribute her own originals. The first 2 tracks are great with a hip hop flavor. The 2 tracks come off as exciting, but after that, the album seems to fall a bit downhill - into the bin of laziness most celebs take in making half-baked Christmas albums (more like lumps of coal). <br />  <br /> Christina somewhat falls in this category, but somewhat doesn't. She released the first single (&quot;The Christmas Song&quot;) for this a year before it's release and scored a top 20 smash - there has been no higher selling or higher charting Christmas single since then or for a long period of time before it! The album contains 2 versions - the ballad version and the DANCE version. <br />  <br /> Outside of the dance version and the first 2 tracks, the album (like most Christmas albums) isn't upbeat which is one reason holiday-themed albums are frowned upon. It's even worse that the dance mix is the very last track, and comes in following one of the other ones. But at least unlike other Xmas albums, she even put them there! <br />  <br /> Moving along, the standout track for me is &quot;These Are The Special Times.&quot; She sings the song with such an amazing conviction, and its lyrics don't confine it solely to Christmas time making it worth the money. Enhanced cd features the music video to &quot;The Christmas Song.&quot;
B000084T18|5.0|Don't listen to all the people hating on 50 Cent who keep giving this Cd negative reviews because of all the fame and attention he's been getting. This album is Phenomenal from beginning to end. All the elements that make this album classic are right in place such as 50's incredible flow,his incisive delivery and unforgettable lines and not to mention the infallible production on this album by Dr.Dre and Eminem which give this album a clear & crisp sound quality,making this disc have the edge it needed. Each and Every track is Pure Heat and there's nothing here that can be considered skippable which is a near miracle in today's music market. 50 Cent just spits vitriolic acid on his verses and he retains an unmistakable talent and charisma which is rare in the modern, monotonous rap game. If you look a little deeper and listen a bit closer you'll find that 50 Cent and his album Get Rich or Die Tryin' are a cut above the assembly line rap stars being produced today and that his album is definately one of the very best albums released in 2003. 50 Cent and G-Unit are selling for a real reason,like it or not. And whatever you do,DO NOT pay any mind to everyone hating on 50 afterall I've read most of these reviews and it seems like most of these people can't even spell so just disregard them and buy 50 Cent's hot joint if you don't own it already.  <br />KEY TRACKS:WHAT UP GANGSTA,PATIENTLY WAITING,MANY MEN,IN DA CLUB,HIGH ALL THE TIME,HEAT,IF I CAN'T,BLOODHOUNDS,POOR LIL RICH,DON'T PUSH ME,GOTTA MAKE IT TO HEAVEN,WANKSTA
B0000DD7LB|4.0|When Britney Spears claimed that 'In the zone' was going to have a more 'grown up' sound and then released 'me against the music' i hardly took her seriously. it was hardly very different from her past stuff and would have been at home if released on her last album 'Britney'. however she didn't lie about this album being different. there is a splash of genres mixed up in this album ranging from the sexy electronica beauty 'breathe on me' ,that could give kylie minogue a run for her money, to the beautiful acoustic ballad 'everytime'. While she has offered a wide range of new sounds, she still managed to throw in some great pop songs ('touch of my hand' and 'shadow'), At times some of these experimental sounds don't quite come off too well at first ['Early morning', 'the hook up', 'outrageous'(a very sexy R&B song)] but soon come to be quite addictive after a couple of listens. There is one song that just doesn't get any better even after a thousand listens, that is if can even get through listening to it more than once without cringing in pain; enter 'brave new girl' which is just plain embarassing and makes you wonder what the hell was she smoking when decided to include that song on the album! some of these experiments, though, have made me take her more seriously. there aren't many albums out there that offer quite a variety of sounds like this album can. she recruited some of the best to work with her on this album ,'outrageous'(R.Kelly) ,'earling mornin'(Moby) & 'shadow'(The Matrix) to name a few. Her vocal abilities can be questionable, but that's kinda old. So she's not the best singer in the world, but she gives us what some of the best singers can't give us, great music! There's no denying songs like 'toxic'(an energy driven techno/pop 'bond' song) and 'everytime' won't get stuck in your head! She did a really great job with this album, this album is her best album yet without a doubt.
B00003CXC7|5.0|&quot;Rear Window&quot; finds Hitchcock in top form, and is regarded as one of the director's classics. Jimmy Stewart, Grace Kelly, and Thelma Ritter are all superb in this thriller, in which L.B. Jeffries (played by Stewart) is convinced that he's witnessed a neighbor trying to cover up the murder of his wife. The set is amazing--a single courtyard surrounded by three buildings full of windows into peoples' lives, with Jeffries having full view of all this. Voyeurism becomes the most prominent theme of the movie. As Jeffries is confined to his wheelchair after breaking his leg, all he has to do all day is stare out his window and spy on his neighbors. He's a photographer by profession, though, and he's not bored for long. He enjoys watching other people, taking note of the routine and not so routine happenings. And we enjoy watching Jeffries watching everyone else. The film is not only full of suspense and well-acted, but it also has a lot to say about perspective and seeing and being seen. Highly recommended!
0688170528|4.0|I just finished The Pact (at 3am) and wow.  It was very powerful.  The relationship between these two families and more importantly Chris & Emily is intense - and sets the tone for the book.  Intensity is the primary emotion here, with Chris on trial for Emily's death, which is said to be a suicide.  Did he or didn't he?  I struggled along with Chris as his emotions changed from sadness to fear to anger to indifference.  While a depressing read, it was definitely well-written.  An ending to set every readers mind to rest.
B000002UD0|5.0|This is a very high-energy album, loaded with killer songs from start to finish. Many of them reflect what John was going through during the Lost Weekend, including a few songs about how much he missed Yoko. There are rockers like &quot;What You Got,&quot; songs that are just fun to listen to, like &quot;Whatever Gets You Thru the Night,&quot; softer songs like &quot;Old Dirt Road,&quot; and contemplative songs like &quot;Nobody Loves You (When You're Down and Out).&quot; The two best-known songs on here are &quot;Whatever Gets You Thru the Night&quot; and &quot;#9 Dream&quot;; the latter song John later dimissed as &quot;a piece of garbage I had around.&quot; The album would be 100% perfect if it weren't for &quot;Ya-Ya,&quot; which really kills the mood set by &quot;Nobody Loves You.&quot; That was the perfect closing track, but John had to cover &quot;Ya-Ya&quot; so that the copyright owner would get royalties from a settlement on the songs he would release on the 'Rock and Roll' album. For revenge, John made it the last song on this album, as well as the worst and shortest. The only redeeming thing about it is that his son Julian is also playing on it, a really sweet moment between parent and child.<br /><br /> My faves are &quot;Nobody Loves You,&quot; &quot;Going Down on Love,&quot; &quot;#9 Dream,&quot; &quot;Whatever Gets You Thru the Night,&quot; &quot;Bless You,&quot; and &quot;Steel and Glass&quot; (an attack on Allen Klein which John later said didn't work the way he'd wanted it to). It might not be praised as highly or consistently as POB or 'Imagine,' but the songs on here are just as well-crafted, great, and brutally honest and soul-searching.
B000002J09|5.0|In the late sixties a new sound was emerging from rock and roll and was loved by teenagers and hated by critics of the day. It was this thing called hard rock which took old blues and made it energetic and loud. The front runner of this new sound was Led Zeppelin and music hasn't been the same since. Led Zeppelin's untitled fourth album is undoubtedley one of the greatest albums ever produced. It has a varity of different sounds and messages. Starting off with two energetic and high voltage songs &quot;Black Dog&quot;, and &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; which are just all around fun with everybody playing at the top of their game. Next the album changes pace with the haunting &quot;The Battle of Evermore&quot; based on The Battle of the Pellenor Fields in J.R.R. Tolkien's &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Then comes probably the greatest song in rock history &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; which is enough for anyone to want to buy this album. Next comes &quot;Misty Mountain Hop&quot; based on Tolkien's &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. It too is a great track but more pop than hard rock. &quot;Four Sticks&quot; is probably the weakest track but is still great. Next is &quot;Going to California&quot; a very bluesy ode to Zeppelin's love of the American west coast state. The last track is &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot; which is a very solid track that just makes you automatically think of some Clint Eastwood western and is a great way to end the best album ever. Anyone that says this album sucks probably thinks Slipknot is the greatest band ever. So what are you waiting for? BUY LED ZEPPELIN IV
1582432678|4.0|This is a harrowing look at teenage violence in America. Although fictional, Shriver bases her account on the spate of killings in American high schools.           The protagonist of the novel, Eva, is happy with Franklin but on impulse she decides she wants to marry him. Their union produces Kevin, a troubling boy from the time he is born. Eva has misgivings about having a child in the first place, and whether Kevin is naturally just a nasty child or whether her reservations rub off on him and make him so is up for debate. At any rate, Kevin's behavior and attitude only get worse and, perhaps copying teenage murderers before him, tragedy at his high school ensues.          The ending is inevitably sad, but stay with it--this is a well-done, thoughtful attempt at trying to explain teenage violence in America, and one family's tragic experience with it.
B0000028MA|5.0|I didn't particularly care for this film, but I did have to own the soundtrack: the highlight for me is &quot;Drown,&quot; one of the best Smashing Pumpkins non-album songs. (And as a side note, the version on this soundtrack is the full-length version, not the much shorter radio edit.)      There isn't a bad band or a bad song on here, but I think the best part is that it is such a perfect representation of the mood and music that was prevalent in the early 90's. And although I dislike the classification as the Pumpkins as grunge, this is a great introduction and overview of the genre. Two other bands that helped shape the grunge movement, Hole and Nirvana, are absent, but I don't think that the soundtrack would be any better for their presence.      Skip the film if you wish, but this is an essential album for anyone who grew up in this time period (especially if you hail from Seattle), and a good bet for any rock fan.
B000089RVX|4.0|Ok when I heard all the hype of this album I thought well its worth a listen. So I popped this in and I was like wow this sounds great and then when I kept it going on my rotation on my stearo and it just didn't sound as good as it does the 1st time around. But make no mistake this album is good and Amy Lee has an awesome voice. The drum and guitar work is nice and convincing. It has a decent sound. Since I'm a fan of Living Sacrifice and since Rocky is apart of it I thought I'd check it out. Its not to bad all in all. Check it our for yourself.
0316776963|1.0|Like most Amazon reviews this will say more about me than the book, so it goes. <br /> <br />As a certified bibliophile, regularly trading volumes in at the local used store, I was surprised to find myself dropping this one right into the trash.  My usual reverence for books melted under the withering contempt expressed by David Sedaris for himself and many others who grace the pages of the book. <br /> <br />Presenting itself as a funny honest book about life, it manages to tell an impressive number of lies about the lives of artists and especially gays.  Do not presume I am unaware of the first-hand experience of Mr. Sedaris in these matters, but this only makes his sloppy handling the more shameful. <br /> <br />The family stories are sometimes mildly amusing, but more often cruel and saddening without any special redeeming qualities.  For this reader, he fails to establish any sort of sympathy for the narrator.  As a result, his tales of errors upon errors merely serve to more firmly root him in the cateogory of total loser.  The kind you want to avoid lest it rub off.  <br /> <br />The nonlinear and jumpy nature of the book, serves only to increase the perceived disinterest in the people and situations discussed. <br /> <br />In short, equal parts fluff, cruelty, and misinformation deflate any possible laughter I might have otherwise experienced, and cause me to file this book in the trash, lest someone else suffer the injury of its prose.
B00005JMX6|1.0|This movie is one of the worst films in movie history between Gigli and Battlefield Earth.  I hate this movie so much that I couldn't believe that I spent money to see trash.  If you're expecting a risky romance movie from the trailer you saw, you're wrong and I am not insulting you, I thought that too.  This is another teen movie, now don't get me wrong I like teen movies, but this is horrible and has got to to be the worst movie of the year maybe in history.  Now, they do copy parts from Risky Business(starring Tom Cruise) but it's not good.  The ending, don't even get me started at the ending, it was really bad, now I won't spoil it for you so don't worry. Now, by off the trailer you're thinking it's about this kid(Matthew Kidman, played by Amile Hirsh) has meets the girl next door(Elisha Cuthbert, Danielle) and falls in love with her and has to risk it all for her, I expect you to know that she is a porn star.  I hate this movie so much that I would get all the copies of the DVD's and tapes of this and burn it.  I give this movie my official PC stamp on it, which stands for PURE CRAP.  Don't listen to the people who liked it, they were probably drunk, stoned, maybe mental, etc. during the movie.  The whole movie sucks and is a waste of your life, go see a good movie, life is too short.
B00006V9A0|2.0|NIRVANA was never anything special. Kurt gets so much attention because he killed himself. He always claimed he embraced punk ideals, and even came up with his own &quot;punk ethos&quot;, but even sticking to a &quot;punk ethos&quot; requires one to abide by a set of strict rules and regulations. And isn't adhering to rules and regulations the antithesis of Punk? Thought so. But what're ya gonna do? Punk was nothing but a set of contradictory guidelines on how to &quot;rebel&quot; against society while creating your on mini-society in the process. Plus, NIRVANA was never Punk to begin with, so I don't know why Kurt was such a try-hard at attempting to be a Punk Rocker. Punkers do speed and amphetamines instead of heroin, they have short hair soaked in Aqua Net hairspray instead of having greasy long hair, and their music had the sense of urgency Kurt only wished his own music had. Kurt, you know damn well I'm right, and I thank you for admitting I am. But your music is still too outdated and unimportant for today's youth, and you're still dead. Teen Spirit is one of the most hokey songs of any generation. It's a total joke that &quot;wayward&quot; teens everywhere adopted as an anthem. The song doesn't even have any meaning to it. Or urgency. Or emotion. I do believe that accurately defines Generation X though. Teens says they hate labels, but when nobody else defines them, they whine until they're branded with a freakin' title. Then when they get it, they complain it doesn't accurately reflect them, and the cycle starts over again. Kids of Generation X always did need some other generation to tell them who they are and how they should act. For godsakes, Kurt Cobain told millions of teens throughout the early 90's it was OK to do heroin (actually, he told fans they should go to hell if they endorse drug use and then he secretly did heroin until the final hour before he shot himself). For godsakes, Cobain's music gave the makers of My So-Called Life an excuse to assault us with a new episode of their whiny mini soapopera for teens every week. And for that I will never forgive him.
0812550706|5.0|This is a great book for all ages and a great story regardless of whether you like SciFi or not. I've read it and its sequels several times and it never gets boring. I have also given several copies away as gifts and been told that each recipient was quite pleased with the book.    Card's &quot;parallel&quot; book Ender's Shadow is also a great read to get the flip side of the Ender story. Both stories blend seamlessly and complement each other nicely.
1400032717|3.0|The book was good, but the most interesting aspect of it is that it explains in two pages how the famous three-door puzzle works.
038551123X|4.0|What can one say about yet again another serial killer novel. Authors are desperately trying to put a new spin on a very old and tired formula. However, Jeff Lindsay may have succeeded in making his a bit more offbeat than the vast majority. <br />     Dexter Morgan is a blood splatter analyst on the Miami PD. He is also a very disturbed man who just so happens to be a serial killer. However, his victims are serial killers themselves whether they are priests who kill children or mentally deranged janitors, Dexter finds them and kills them with great enjoyment. He now appears to be up against a killer who murders women leaving their cut up and bloodless bodies in neat little packages for the police to find. However, the killer is onto Dexter in that Dexter is finding clues in his kitchen and car indicating the killer knows who he is.  To make matters worse, Dexter is not sure if, while he supposedly dreams, he is in fact killing. Needless to say, he tries to help his sister get ahead in the police department by giving her insight into the killing- things that only another killer would know. <br />     There is a sense of originality with Dexter being a 'lovable serial killer'.  He is an original creation and a unique voice in crime fiction. The good idea, however, eventually begins to wear as thin as the uneven plot. Stereotypes abound and in spite of the uniqueness of the main protagonist, the other characters are routine creations. The conclusion is highly unrealistic and comes virtually out of nowhere. However, the length of the story is manageable and the book well edited.
B000088E6D|4.0|A bit all over the place, in terms of the selections on this CD, but understandable because the artist obviously needs to make his versatility known. Peggy Lee to Neil Sedaka to Van Morrison to Sinatra to Lou Rawls to the Bee Gees........etc....<br /> Having said that, Mr. Buble nails each song and genre. He has a masterful control of his voice, phrasing, and timing. Listen to \\"Moondance\\" to hear his energy and how effectively he colors and styles each word. I am very impressed. I have always been familiar with the Bee Gee's \\"How to mend a broken heart\\", and it has always been listenable, but Mr. Buble's version, especially with Barry Gibb singing backup, made me stand up and take notice.<br /><br /> The energy and joy that comes through on \\"Come Fly with Me\\" and \\"The Summer Wind\\" bring a smile to my face and in my mind, show Sinatra the ultimate compliment.<br /><br /> Difficult segues aside, definitely buy this CD.
B000002U82|5.0|DSOTM is unbelievable.  I have never experienced anything this beautiful.  Pink Floyd has created something that resonates within the deepest parts of your soul and will fill your heart.  Oh, it sounds so cheesy.  But DSOTM is just too good.  No one will ever create anything like this again. <br /> <br />If you've already discovered Dark Side and are looking for more Floyd, I would recommend starting with Wish You Were Here and working your way to the Wall.  If you're partial to these two, go for Animals.  If you find yourself longing for the innocence, joy, and wonder of DSOTM, go for Meddle or Obscured by Clouds, which are closer to DSOTM but not as coherent or consistent.
B00005V3Z4|3.0|Good film, entertaining, although depressing. <br />Acting is good and interesting. <br />However this independent film, albeit the best I've seen in a while, is NOT HALF as amazing as some of these reviewers will have u thinking, and NOT HALF as DEEP as these people have you thinking. <br />Hyped to muchh- this movie won't deliver <br />Mediocre review- Some will watch it and say hey its not that bad. <br />If you give it a terrible review- most will like it because they won't consider it terrible. <br />Not much replay value in this film if you ask me and I love many films. But the DVD is cheap and if you like these sort of films I recommend pickin it up or at least renting. <br />
1567184855|5.0|Probing far deeper than just near-death experiences or past life recall, Michael discovered much about life in the afterlife. Most fascinating are his findings on the nature of soul families and how souls select their future incarnations by directly viewing how each set of possibilities could unfold.
B000002A3T|3.0|There is an objective fact that every Pink Floyd fan must recognize-- Roger Waters was the songwriter of the band, David Gilmour was the soul, and Wright and Mason were very talented buffers that kept the two egomaniacs from killing each other. On &quot;The Division Bell,&quot; the songwriter is gone, supplanted by a battalion of no-names who lack Waters' lyrical talents, and Gilmour has solos that, while technically impressive, are colorless and soulless.... his work on &quot;Animals&quot; and DSotM make the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end, it's so good, but here, the solos never seem to click, and some go on FOREVER. <br />  <br /> Having said that, there are some great songs on this album. When &quot;Cluster One&quot; gets going, you'd think you were back in 1971.. Gilmour employs plenty of echo effects, and Rick Wright carries on a musical conversation with him on his keyboards. The same goes for the instrumental (and Grammy-winning) &quot;Marooned.&quot; <br /> A song I really like is &quot;Wearing the Inside Out,&quot; written and sung by Rick Wright. &quot;High Hopes&quot; is a terrific song-- it is unlike any other Floyd song I've ever heard. <br />  <br /> Weak points: nearly everywhere else. Gilmour is a somewhat uninspired composer, and &quot;Take It Back&quot; and &quot;Coming Back To Life&quot; are throwbacks to &quot;A Momentary Lapse Of Reason&quot;-- something that nearly every Floyd fan wants to forget. Other songs aren't necessarily bad, just boring, such as &quot;A Great Day For Freedom,&quot; and &quot;Keep Talking.&quot; The listenter occasionally loses interest.  <br />  <br /> Overall, only about half of this album is really GOOD (but man, I LOVE &quot;High Hopes.&quot;) However, that is enough (in my book) to get it. It's great to see the boys back after the subpar &quot;Momentary Lapse,&quot; and we can only hope that there is more to come. Get it to complete your collection and enjoy a few good tracks.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|This is probably Brian DePalma's best film ever.  I can never stop watching this movie!  Anyone who grew up in the late 70s and 80s will probably indentify with this flick!   <br /> <br />If you don't like the movie, then don't be a wanker about it!  I just reported John Charet for posting innappropriate material!  Time for you to get banned you wanker!
1559408898|4.0|To the casual filmgoer, this film may be little more that a entertaining sci-fi/action picture. But to the more perceptive cinephiles, this is a great satire. The plot revolves around Police Oficer, Murphy(Peter Weller), who on his first day in a new precinct, gives persuit to a group of criminals. Overly zealous, him and his partner follow the gang into a derelict steel-works. Murphy is brutally slain by the felons, and what is left of him is turned into Robocop; a half human, half robot, law inforcement officer. Paul Verhoeven, directing his second American film, satirizes both big business, and American industrial faliure. Big business, according to Verhoeven, creats a problem(crime, drugs), then makes a product to solve it(Robocop). In one scene, OCP unveils its new ED 209 enforcement droid, to the company's board of staff. The machine malfunctions during the trial, killing a man. This peticular scene, satirizes America's industrial faliure.
B00003CXCT|5.0|man i get really sick when i read your comments about lucas. <br />he is money hungry? so then why didnt he release the OT on DVD years ago to get all your $$$? <br />and why not now? see.. <br /> <br />and one cant compare SW with a painting... <br />a painting isnt a part of a saga, or is it? <br /> <br />im glad he releases only the newer versions of HIS saga with HIS vision... <br /> <br />i for one dont want to see washed out picture quality and bad background matte paintings (f.e. detention block) <br /> <br />all of you whiners stick to your old LD and live happily ever after... <br /> <br />
B0001NBMBC|4.0|Well I guess after IOWA, they wanted to do something different and be more expiramental. They were never really havey in the first place, however this is their most mellow release to date. Dedication to craft made Slipknot kings. From the sparks of a collective genesis in the basements of Des Moines, the Iowa collective set dutifully to constructing their metallurgical music flamethrower. But there was also the crafty psy-ops deployed on a nation of malleable young minds, the agit-prop of masks, smocks, and bar codes that helped transform fans into maggots and emphasize Slipknot's larger vision of a black bag revolution over any alluring lull of individual celebrity. The Midwestern origin of all this craziness was genius, as the band's marrow-draining metal and twisted, fibrous mythology was antithetical to the region's rep. Vol. 3 does share its lyrical troika of anger, disaffection, and psychosis with most of the nu-metal pack. Lyrics like &quot;I've screamed until my veins collapsed&quot; and &quot;Push my fingers into my eyes/It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache&quot; aren't unique to the Slipknot cult, but unlike so many, the band isn't making records to appease labels. Only rarely does its music disassemble into the genre building blocks -- riff + glowering vocal + throaty chorus = Ozzfest satiety -- that clutter the efforts of their contemporaries. What makes Vol. 3 tick is the dedication made to crafting a Slipknot album, and not just another flashy Nu-Metal album. While I prefer their earlier efforts I must say that if you own the previous 3, then you must have this.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Hey Mr. Lucas - if you want my money, you'll have to give me the product I want, not the product you want.  Pretty complicated stuff, huh?  Since you messed up these movies, I'll be spending my money on the Alien Quadrilogy instead.  <br /> <br />Thanks for caring.
B00005A46T|5.0|When I listen to this record I hear influences of Slayer, Metallica, NIN, KoRn, and a little bit of reggae in here. This is without a shadow of a doubt Slipknot's best. The drummer is rather good, but he pales in comparison to the drummer for Cryptopsy. After a couple years of relentless touring in support of their self-titled breakthrough album, Slipknot regrouped to record Iowa, an ode to their home state and one that consolidates and punctuates everything that had garnered the band its cultish following known as &quot;the maggots.&quot; The guitar crunch, the concrete-dense rhythmic foundation, the frenzied singing, and the overall madcap fashion of it all Slipknot's trademark sound is very much at the forefront of this dark, dark album and is presented in epic form on the extended, album-closing title track, which brings to mind Children of the Corn-type terrors. Though not quite as commercially viable as the more straightforward Slipknot album, Iowa is a more interesting album. It also has a more Industrial Metal influence and feel to it, but still remains true to the Nu-Metal genre. However for those of you who are brave enough to venture further into metal I recommend better and far heavier bands like Suffocation, Nile, Decapitated, Origin, Cryptopsy, Immolation, Vital Remains, Dying Fetus, Meshuggah, Strapping Young Lad, and Gorguts.
0385334206|4.0|This book has a lot of extremely offensive language. Once you get past that, the story is a wonderful mix of humor and real human insight. It helped me appreciate life. <br /> <br />I highly recommend watching it WITH the movie--like, read the book, then immediately watch the movie, then watch the movie again while holding the book in front of you. It's even better if you can listen to the Flaming Lips at the same time. No, really, I'm serious, try it!
B00000JCOV|5.0|I like this band and there isn't anything they can do to change my mind. You know what, I know what deathmetal and thrash metal is, and I also know that Slipknot is neither of those. Slipknot is Nu-Metal, and as a fan of all types of metal, I can say that this is the best band that Nu-Metal has to offer. Slipknot's mix of grinding, post-Korn alternative metal, Marilyn Manson-esque neo-shock rock, and rapcore helped make them one of the most popular bands in the so-called nu-metal explosion of the late '90s. These guys are something else entirely. And it's pretty impressive. Although those lyrics that are discernible are not generally quotable on a family website, suffice it to say that the members of Slipknot are not impressed with their fathers, their hometown, or most anything else. &quot;Surfacing&quot; starts out by cursing pretty much everything generally, and then it starts getting aggressive, as shrieking guitar feedback alternates with DJ scratching. &quot;Spit It Out&quot; is speed Nu-metal with an actual melody in the chorus; &quot;Scissors&quot; ends the program with a sound that quite simply couldn't get any more aggro without falling apart entirely and by the end, the singer actually sounds like he's about to burst into tears. Now alot of &quot;metalheads&quot; are dissing these guys and their fans for liking them. Why? Because they get mad hearing the &quot;maggots&quot; going around and saying these guys are the heaviest ever, which isn't true at all. Slipknot is pretty tame compared to Meshuggah, Slayer, Dying Fetus, Immolation, Cryptopsy, Suffocation, Nile, Origin, Strapping Young Lad, Decapitated, etc...the list goes on. Yeah thank you &quot;metalheads&quot; for telling us what to do, telling us what we can and can't listen to, and thank you for conforming to every other &quot;metalheads&quot; beliefs. Many &quot;metalheads&quot; won't give this band a chance because they don't want to be labeled as posers. Well you know what, I know what I like, and I like Slipknot. There's nothing you can say or do that will change that. This is not as good as IOWA, but it is better than Mate, Feed, Kill, Repeat and Subliminal Verses Vol. 3. Buy this today, and also check out the bands mentioned above if you want REALLY extreme and heavy music.
B00005JMFQ|3.0|This movie has a lot of different storylines that are difficult to keep track of.       Parts of it are very, very funny. The sex scenes with the porn star actors are hysterical. The completely unrealistic scene with the Brit boy in Milwaukee is quite funny as well.      Some scenes are sad--such as the scene with the woman in love with her coworker, who almost \\"shags\\" him but can't make herself ignore the ringing phone when it's her mentally ill brother.      The kid whose stepfather goes with him to \\"get the s**t kicked out of him by love\\" is ADORABLE. I hope he stars in more movies.      I was brought to tears by the woman who discovered her husband might be cheating on her (...). I wish that storyline had been better developed.       There are a lot of cheesy parts to the movie, yes, but I think it was supposed to be cheesy, not serious. So, overall I would recommend it. I think it's a good movie in the \\"cheese\\" genre.
B000021YQV|5.0|My previous reviews were deleted I guess because of arguing with that ignorant so and so KarlMarx, so I better re-do my review more politely. <br />  <br /> Let me tell you about System of a Down ladies & gentlemen, SOAD is the most creative, original, exciting band in music right now. Daron Malakian is an incredible song writer, he is the talent of this band, this guy seems to have a talent of thinking up radical ideas for songs in his head but then actually getting them to work and putting them on record. For example lets take the song &quot;Chop Suey&quot;, this is a perfect example to sum up SOAD in 3 minutes, because this song takes you on a complete rollercoaster of a ride (in just 3.30 mins), its an amazing whirlwind of time changes, differing emotions & radical musical textures. This is the kind of song most of us will struggle to think up in our heads, no matter how imaginative you may be, but to mould a song out of what you think up in your head is the hard part, but Malakian does it. <br />  <br /> &quot;Chop Suey&quot; is a relatively short song, but its also an EPIC, it has the swift brutality of a punk rock classic yet it also has the complexity & variation of a 9 minute prog rock track. Genius. From the opening spine tingling acoustic strum, to the chaotic, agressive midpoint, to the intense emotional balladry of the outro, this is 3 and a half minutes of pure genius. Just take a look at the writing credits on this album and you will see who runs the show in this band...its Daron Malakian. <br />  <br /> He's not the only talent in the band however, Serj Tankian is an amazing vocalist, best displayed on &quot;Aerials&quot; here he shows his awesome vocal range. Complete with John Dolymayan's incredibly powerful drumming & Rick Rubin's, as always, stellar production work you have the best rock album in years. <br />  <br /> And to all those who say System are sell outs & that they are mainstream rubbish let me tell you how it is, the reason SOAD sell alot of records and this album debuted at #1 on the US album charts (on the morning of 9/11) is because whatever you may think about the state of the music industry, there is still a market for real music, there is a huge fan base for cutting edge music like this, this is why SOAD sell a lot, not because they are mainstream or MTV driven, but because people are sick of that kind of stuff and want real music, here is where SOAD step in, so don't call them mainstream garbage because their music isn't mainstream, their music is intelligent, challenging and as raw as you can get, how many millions it sells is irrelevant. <br />  <br /> Now for my ratings: <br />  <br /> Prison Song: 9/10 <br /> Needles: 9.5/10 <br /> Deer Dance 9.5/10 <br /> Jet Pilot 7/10 <br /> X 9/10 <br /> Chop Suey 10/10 <br /> Bounce 6/10 <br /> Forest 9/10 <br /> ATWA 10/10 <br /> Shimmy 8/10 <br /> Science 10/10 <br /> Toxicity 9/10 <br /> Psycho 8/10 <br /> Aerials 11/10 *** best track <br />
B000002B7Y|5.0|No Rest For The Wicked(1988). Ozzy Osbourne's Fifth Album, and the First to Feature Guitarist Zakk Wylde.<br /><br /> After Guitarist Jake Lee's departure from Ozzy's band after recording 'Bark At The Moon' and 'The Ultimate Sin', Ozzy was on the search for a new guitarist, and he would soon be blessed with one of the finest. After being impressed by tapes of Guitar Instructor Zakk Wylde, Ozzy immediately recruited Wylde to his band. Immediately Wylde hit off with Ozzy, taking Ozzy's sound more away from the Neo-Classical Guitar of Randy Rhoads and the Bluesy Metal sound of Jake Lee to a Thrash Metal guitar style courtesy Zakk Wylde, emploring the techniques of fellow rockers like Metallica, yet adding a sludgy/squealy sound of his own, not to mention absolutely amazing solos. In the coming years, his style was used by Jerry Cantrell(Alice In Chains), but his influential style and guitar mastery set him apart from other guitarists. Upon its release in 1988, 'No Rest For The Wicked' climbed to the Billboard Top 20, and spawned the MTV Video Hits 'Miracle Man', 'Breaking All The Rules', and 'Crazy Babies', proving Ozzy was as successful as ever, and only would get more popular with 1991's 'No More Tears'. So, is 'No Rest For The Wicked' an underrated and overlooked part of Ozzy's career, or is it simply Ozzy trying to find his sound? Read On To Find Out....<br /><br /> Track Ratings-<br /><br /> Miracle Man- 'Miracle Man' starts the album off loud and hard, an insulting ode to TV Evangelist Jimmy Swaggert, who constantly claimed Ozzy was a Satan Worshipper. Wylde's chugging riffs and odd feedback noises, combined with a Eddie Van Halen inspired guitar solo shows Wylde can rip on the guitar with the best of them. Ozzy's sarcastic vocals definitely help 'Miracle Man' to be a Top-Notch Heavy Rocker.<br /><br /> Devil's Daughter(Holy War)- 'Devil's Daughter' blares out with Wylde's squealing riff, but soon Ozzy takes center-stage with his questioning vocals that flow easily into the more up-beat chorus. 'Devil's Daughter' particuarly stands out for the odd musical interlude with a squealing baby, but soon Wylde comes back and rips one of the longest and best solos of his career. Great song!<br /><br /> Crazy Babies- 'Crazy Babies' is perhaps Ozzy's oddest song, and his high-pitched opening vocals are priceless. Ozzy's oddly challenging vocals(listen to the chorus!)take center-stage, but Wylde's Ambulance Guitar Effect and solo back Ozzy up perfectly, making 'Crazy Babies' a fun odd Heavy Metal Rocker!<br /><br /> Breaking All The Rules- 'Breaking All The Rules' arguably accomplishes the fact that Ozzy does in fact not care about rules, with his sarcastic vocals, lyrics, chorus, and Wylde's pulsing guitar riff.Ozzy's ode to Anarchy,'Breaking All The Rules' is a great Sarcastic Hard Rocker.<br /><br /> Bloodbath In Paradise- 'Bloodbath In Paradise' is Ozzy's criticism of the Vietnam War, yet it gives you the feeling as if you just stepped into a Horror Movie, with Ozzy's gory lyrics and spooky vocals combined with the sinister guitar riff making 'Bloodbath In Paradise' my favorite track off 'No Rest For The Wicked'. The band Anthrax was an influence for Ozzy probably for this song.<br /><br /> Fire In The Sky- 'Fire In The Sky' is a heartbroken ballad, and no Ozzy album is complete without one. Ozzy's utterly tear-jerking vocals behind Wylde's steadily piercing Electric Guitar proves Ozzy can dish out ballads like no other.<br /><br /> Tattooed Dancer- 'Tatooed Dancer' is perhaps 'No Rest For The Wicked''s weakest track, because Wylde's guitar riff and Ozzy's vocals sound much like the other tracks, not really setting this one apart. Still, 'Tatooed Dancer' is an awesome track, sporting some creepy musical interludes and a short but sweet solo courtesy Wylde.<br /><br /> Demon Alchohol- 'Demon Alchohol' starts off very doomy, featuring a spooky guitar riff behind Ozzy's creepy vocals(Much like 'No More Tear''s &quot;Mr. Tinkertrain&quot;), but soon 'Demon Alchohol' switches gears to be a Light Hard Rocker with a particular Van Halen influenced sound. 'Demon Alchohol' is an excellent Fast Paced Rocker.<br /><br /> Extra Tracks:<br /><br /> Hero- 'Hero' starts off loudly with Wylde's squealing high-pitched riff, but soon 'Hero' slows down, incorporating Ozzy's symphonic vocals, Wylde's slowly chugging guitar riff, and a touch of a synth bassline to make 'Hero' a Hard Rocking Ballad that won't fail to please. Don't Skip It! One of NRFtW's Best!<br /><br /> The Liar- 'The Liar' is a Keyboard and Synthesizer Heavy Ballad, and very much sounds like his material on 'Ozzmosis' or 'Down To Earth'. Ozzy's vocals are a tad whiny and the guitar work is non-existent(other than the beautiful solo) but 'The Liar' still is a great listen.<br /><br /> Miracle Man(LIVE)- 'Miracle Man' played live sounds just as good as its studio counterpart, and Ozzy's stage prescense and energetic crowd involvement make it maybe more interesting than the original.<br /><br /> Overall, 'No Rest For The Wicked' proved that Ozzy once again dominated the Heavy Metal scene, but more importantly, it showed the world Zakk Wylde, whose work on 'No More Tears', 'Ozzmosis', 'Down To Earth' and with his band Black Label Society never would have happened without his phenomenal debut 'No Rest For The Wicked', an album that rightfully sits alongside more popular Ozzy albums such as 'Blizzard of Ozz' or 'No More Tears'.<br /><br /> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! IF YOU ARE A FAN OF OZZY, HEAVY METAL, METAL, HARD ROCK, 80'S ROCK, ZAKK WYLDE, ALICE IN CHAINS, OR YOU DISLIKE JIMMY SWAGGERT, I CAN'T RECOMMEND 'NO REST FOR THE WICKED' MORE!

B000055Y0X|5.0|I used to be his neighbor up near Columbia, CA, and he was a customer in my store as well. More than once he reflected on this fateful movie that he did after several westerns. On those movies he was &quot;Hey You!&quot;, after after Dr. Strangelove, he said that he became &quot;Mr. Pickens&quot; with a dressing room of his own. Interesting twist of fate. I met him right about the time he was in Blazing Saddles, another &quot;classic&quot;, as this one is.....
B00005JMFQ|2.0|Personally, I do love all the actors. But, I felt like the characters were not fleshed out as much as I wished. I felt like I was left hanging because I wanted more out of these people. Yes, there are some really funny parts to this film. But with so many actors and so much action going on, I wish there was fewer to concetrate on and as I say, more to be fleshed out. <br /> <br />Personally, I would perfer Bridget Jones Diary over this and even some Sense and Sensibilty or even Emma with basically the same actors in them.
B00008EY65|4.0|This is one really cool movie! Awesome action scenes and everything! See it.  GO TO  members.cox.net/hunter21291  for full review.
B00005JN2F|5.0|Remembered enjoying the last movie, it inspired me to start reading the series (sure the movies don't follow the books, but c'mon, different media, not fair to compare...) and see this movie.  I read reviews on Rotton Tomatoes and was expecting camera work on level of Blair Witch.  There isn't any or I didn't notice it.  Things start moving from jump and don't stop until the end when the credits start rolling.  And in that sense, the camera seems to keep pace with the action.  There's no roller coaster pans or slo-mo bullet cams though!  I enjoy these films for their execution.  It's a rarity when an action/adventure film isn't driven by a hail of bullets, gore, and tacky, catchprhase, jingoistic dialogue.  Those movies are insulting to watch.  And while the plot/story is simple and simplified, Damon's face and delivery are on the mark, I didn't notice music (I hate melodramatic action music) and the scenes and locations seem genuine.  It's more action than intrigue, but see this movie even if you didn't see the last (it's self-contained) or even if you read the books (don't be a snob).
B000006Y12|5.0|Every so often we are presented with listening opportunities that change our lives, baffle our hearing, and grant us the pleasure to be in the company of such greatness. The Gallery is no exception and hands down the greatest melo-death release in history, setting the standard for this genre, which still hasn't been surpassed or even rivaled, and probably will never be, for its sheer timelessness, even by greats such as Jester Race era In Flames, Burning Bridges Arch Enemy, and Predator's Portrait Soilwork. There is just no comparison to an album displaying musical genius in songwriting, melody, and lyrical content without one weak moment. Now onto the details: <br /> The dual guitar harmonozing is among the best out there, not only in this style, but in all forms of metal as well. The lead passages alternate with the time changes in perfect intricacy. The drum patterns hold the backbone of this legend together like no other, and the bass is actually heard, unlike many metal bands out there today, and surely stands out as a solo instrument in the intro to &quot;Lethe&quot; (Yes that's a 5-string bass they're using). <br /> The vocals should receive no complains from even the uninitiated into the death/black metal growls. They match the mood of the music perfectly and, guess what, you actually understand what is being sung. And the lyrical content is some of the greatest work I've ever read about the themes of love and death, on par with the likes of Opeth. <br /> If you call yourself a devoted metal fan, go out and purchase the godliness that is Dark Tranquillity now without regret! If you have been wise enough to already do so, I commend you for your great taste in music. And after that, pick up Damage Done, further pick up all the albums by these guys, you won't be disappointed. You will forget that such a thing as MTV's mainstream rock exists after hearing this masterpeace. The gods of Olympus overlook this grand creation and Dionysus smiles and applauds as he has never done before!
B00005JMFQ|4.0|\\"Love Actually\\" was generally a funny and entertaining film, but I thought they went a bit overboard with a few things. I could have done without the porn-star couple, for example, or the cliche \\"run through the airport before the plane departs\\" scene when the young boy is trying to catch the American girl on whom he has a crush before she flies off to America, perhaps never to return. <br />  <br /> There also wasn't enough development of a relationship between the PM and his caterer. First she hires onto his staff and embarasses herself profusely, then there are a few not-particularly-romantic scenes of them going about their general business. When the PM finds her in an awkward situation with the President of the United States, he quietly has her transferred to another department, thinking that's the end of it.  <br />  <br /> Upon the unexpected receipt of a Christmas card from her, the PM suddenly realizes he loves her, which makes no sense since as far as we the audience know, he doesn't really even know her that well. It wasn't very believable to me that a man in his position would go to so much trouble to pursue a woman unless he suspected that she was pretty special, and I didn't get the sense from the story that he could have known enough about her to justify the lengths he went to. <br />  <br /> All in all, \\"Love Actually\\" is a fun movie with a positive message about weathering the good and bad of romantic relationships (and platonic ones like the aging rock star and his manager), so long as you're willing to overlook a few unbelievable aspects of the storyline.
B000286S8S|1.0|Why? Why? Why?  Are we all to forget about the Best of album now, because this is almost exactly the same.  Why they don't get DLR back into the band and drop Sammy (can't sing, can't right) Hagar it beggers belief.  The new tracks on the CD are trash.  VH were good at the beginning, but no way are they even half as good now.  I can't recommend buying this because it's literally the same album as released last time.  Well apart from that joke of a record VH3.
B00002E23E|2.0|I use to be a big fan back in the day, and I recall enjoying this video a lot. Many years later, I am not quite so enthralled as I once was. Most of Page's solos are pretty sloppy IMHO, and Plant is off quite a bit as well. Some decent performances (Moby Dick is probably the best), but most are mediocore. As for the dream sequences, a bit goofy, but not that bad. Some interesting footage worked in as well. Worth a look if your a fan, but I would prefer to see a better performance from these guys.
B00024BHTC|1.0|Terrible singing, stupid melodies, stupid opera based keyboard overtures and one of the most ugliest, daftest looking bands I've ever set eyes on in ages.  If you're into amateur metal then Nightwish will appeal to you, because all they are amateur.  Finland is a useless country when it comes to musicianship.  Same as YGM and his Rising Farce from Sweden.  If you want to get into decent European metal go for Ramstein.  Germany has provided the world with some awesome metal over the years, but Finland, forget it!
B00003CXXM|4.0|The Bourne Identity is a well made thriller about a covert agent who's 'malfunctioned' and wakes with amnesia. Matt Damon, who plays Jason Bourne, aka several other names, finds himself unable to remember who he is and at the same time aware that he's got a few 'skills' that seperate him from the rest of normal society.<br /><br />Set on location in Switzerland and France, this well-paced story moves right along. Along with Damon there is Franka Potente who he meets as he attempts to speak with someone at the U.S. embassy in Zurich. Offering her money to drive him to Paris in search of his identity, she accepts with reservations. And so the chase begins. Other agents like Bourne are called into action to find him and a series of chases and assasination attempts ensues.<br /><br />The characters playing these Bourne-like agents aren't really delved into, which is a shame. This also calls to mind the major weakness in the story- the U.S. government controllers who are after him. The role of 'controller' is stereotypically played throughout and it's perhaps the only weakness in the movie.<br /><br />The Bourne Identity isn't great movie-making; what it is is good entertainment. A good cast, script and well paced action scenes move the plot along at a steady pace. I thoroughly enjoyed it and hope to see its sequel very soon.
B00003CXHJ|5.0|Although it's inevitable that audiences tend to compare similar type movies, the hostility towards this film in the reviews tends to forget that even if one movie isn't up to par with the other (re: DAS BOOT), that doesn't make it a bad movie.<br /><br />Anyway, director Jonathan Mostow (Breakdown) does an admirable job in relaying the sardine-can quality of life in a submarine and the harsh reality of war.  The action sequences are very suspenseful and the cast on the whole is very good.  Matthew McConaughey brings a staunch reluctant heroism to his role as the X0 who finds himself in charge after the death of their captain (Bill Paxton in an understated performance.  Harvey Keitel does well in his role as the Chief, and the supporting players (David Keith, Jake Weber, Jack Noseworthy, Erik Palladino, et al) are just fine.<br /><br />I'm not a big war movie fan, but when they're done this well and keep me entertained for two hours, I forget the genre and concentrate on the movie.<br /><br />RECOMMENDED.
B0001HAHXW|4.0|Eric's love of Johnson's music is probably over chronicled. Why did it take so long for this tribute? His answer is that he's finally not afraid to do the project, that he has enough distance from Eric's youthful adulation and awe to meet the project with confidence. This collection is not a faithful purist recreation of Robert Johnson, but an amalgam of musical styles that a mature Clapton brings to each song. It is reminiscent of Peter Green with Nigel Watson & Splinter Group. Green et. al and Clapton approach Johnson's material with maturity, understatement, and a good reason to continue listening to their CDs all the way through, instead of shaking your head in disgust while quickly reaching for Robert's original versions. If Clapton wasn't famous, this CD would generate a buzz anyway. It's worth buying if you are a Clapton fan who shied away from his pop drivel, and worth buying if you are a blues fan. Also, try Green's &quot;Hot Foot Powder&quot; a Robert Johnson tribute that preceeded Clapton's by a couple of years.
B00005JMEW|3.0|To say this is a Quentin Tarantino action movie pretty much tells the whole story (if you know Quentin Terantino's other films). However, as I'm a much more long-winded guy than that, I'll supply some details. It has been amply publicized that Kill Bill is an homage (or blatent copy) of Kung Fu/Samurai films (mainly the latter because everyone has a sword), but updated in the same way that Raiders of the Lost Ark updated B-movie serials of the '40's (this is Tarantino's analogy). The story: An assasin tries to retire and goes into hiding, but is found and murdered on her wedding day, along with her entire wedding party and unborn child. But wait! Despite being shot in the head and spending 4-years in a coma, a scant few months after awakening she is the greatest sword-fighter in the world. If this sounds rediculous, it's because logic and plot should not really be contemplated when discussing this film. <br />  <br /> Uma Thurman plays the not-quite-killed Bride who seeks revenge on her former colleagues, who include Lucy Liu, Vivica Fox, and Daryl Hannah. These 4 women in a film together makes it worth viewing, and they all reach a kind of sublime corniness - the entire film is a wink at the audience, but the actors never let themselves in on the joke. The action and the swordplay are a delight to watch. It is extremely violent, but in a corny, stylised way (much like the Evil Dead films) - limbs are severed and fountains of blood spray out. That no one bleeds to death after losing this much blood is part of the joke. <br />  <br /> There are great highlights to the film. I especially liked The Bride's excape from the hospital after awakening from her coma, and the opening battle of the film with the Fox character. Unfortunately, the culminating battle - with Liu's private army of 88 sword-weilding grunts plus her personal assistants - goes on far too long and frankly gets boring. The most disappointing aspect of the film, however, is the startling lack of dialogue. I go to see Tarantino films for the intercharacter banter - see Pulp Fiction, for example. Here, the plot is so action-driven the characters have little chance to speak, and when they do, it's banal speeches like the one Liu delivers after decapitating a lieutenant for having the gall to disparage her Chinese heritage. <br />  <br /> These disappointments are somewhat petty - the film is not supposed to be about dialogue, after all. However, this DVD edition is a big disappointment. It looks and sounds great, but that is expected of a 2003 release. No, it's the lack of extras that robs a star from my rating of the film - Tarantino is such an interesting guy, very self-aware and knowledgeable, so why isn't there a director's commentary? No, all we get on this DVD is a short making-of featurette that looks like it was assembled from bits that appeared on Entertainment Tonight. I refuse to purchase Mirimax DVD's because they are so bare-bones it's not worth the money. I will wait and hope for a &quot;special edition&quot; box set packaging Vol. 1 and 2 together.
0812550706|4.0|I recently finished Ender's Game and enjoyed it more than most books of the Sci-Fi or Fantasy genre I have read. Orson Scott Card is a gifted writer. His charcterizations are wonderful and the story is engaging. <br /> <br />This book was recommended to me by a guy I recently met. I had not met many others that had read another series that has turned into my favorite epic saga of all time...that being George R. R. Martin's 'A Song of Ice and Fire.' Seeing that he was in agreement with me on Martin's series, I thought I'd give Ender's Game a try.  <br /> <br />I had really high expectations for it and this is something I try not to do, because most of the time they can never be reached, no matter how good a book. And, unfortunately, I think it happened here too.  <br /> <br />The book kept me interested throughout and proved to be quite interesting. The climax was not as big an event for me as I was hoping, possibly because I had an inkling of what would happen, and it did. I'd say more but I don't want to give anything away. <br /> <br />I definitely recommend this book regardless. It is enjoyable and is a good read that is not too long. I'd recommend ignoring all those reviews that gave this book (or any book for that matter) 1 or 5 stars. The 1 star reviews are all worthless. A 1 star review on a book like this is typically someone that has a negative outlook on anything popular. The 5 star reviews are more likely to be genuine though maybe over the top on the praise. That's just my general take on most reviews.  <br /> <br />Anyway, get the book and read it, you won't be disappointed and you'll be satisfied with the time spent. <br /> <br />Enjoy!
B00003CXBK|5.0|Wow, so there seems to be a lot of controversy on this film.  Yes I definitely agree with the fact that it is not for young children.  So for the rest of us who can watch it..just watch it and move on.  I have never been into animee (sp?) movies, but I really like this one.  Okay so I really dug the little forrest spirits.  Too cute.  Back to my point though, people try to read too much into movie meanings and messages.  GET OVER IT!  Just enjoy the story and worry about more important things in this world. These reviews where people are going into their crazy beliefs and crap are hillarious.  Movies are for entertainment purposes only kiddies.
B0001ENYKS|5.0|Like NME magazine once said, this CD will change your life. And it has undoubtedly changed my--a 16 year old's life. You cannot simply describe Franz Ferdinand's music in a few words. It's just something I've never heard before. The lyrics are weird and makes no sense, but this is what makes the band unique. They have such a special sound that you can either love it or hate it. I personally LOVE it.  <br /> <br />1. Jacqueline 4/5 Great opening track. <br />2. Tell Her Tonight 5/5 I absolutely LOVE their voices on this track. <br />3. Take Me Out 5/5 Their first single. Wise choice. Such a great song. <br />4. Matinee 5/5 More of a poppy sound to it, but brilliant. <br />5. Auf Acshe 4/5 Good song, but what does Auf Acshe mean? <br />6. Cheating On You 4/5 I love the chorus. FAB. <br />7. This Fire 5/5 Another great song. Simply indescribe-able. (is there such a word?) <br />8. Darts Of Pleasure 5/5 No idea what the lyrics mean. Another of my favs. <br />9. Michael 5/5 MY FAVOURITE SONG. GOD I LOVE IT. <br />10. Come On Home 4/5 a bit different to the other songs. Still great though. <br />11. 40 ft 5/5 Fab closing song. Most musicians put lesser songs at the end, but FF keeps you going. Definetely makse you want to listen to the CD over and over again.
B00006M183|2.0|I cant imagine anyone who is not the most loyal,die-hard Pearl Jam fan liking this album.Riot Act is the bands weakest album-tired riffs and vocals and unfocused lyrics throughout. <br /> <br />In my opinion,Pearl Jam tried to go for a warts and all,raw,unproduced feel.But the songs just sound sloppy without the hooks,Vedder sounds tired without the soaring choruses.And lyrics written by too many people in the band to have one singular vision. <br /> <br />If you want to buy a great Pearl Jam album that isnt Ten,I would suggest 1998's Yield.Delicous riffs,atmospheric vibes and Vedder at top of his game as a singer.Great rockers and even better ballads make that album a 5.Riot Act is a 2.
B000286S8S|5.0|Best of Both World is a must buy for any Van Halen Fan. Just the volume of music alone should give your cd changer a rest. The new tunes ROCK. With &quot;up for breakfest&quot; as the best of the new ones. Buy and enjoy and ROCK.
B00008EY65|3.0|If you liked Raiders of the Lost Ark, MIB, Star Wars, and any super hero movie over the last twenty years or so, you should like Hellboy.  One reason may be that Hellboy lifts, pretty blatantly, from a number of those films.  You will find yourself often recalling scenes from other films.  And that's ok, Spielburg has made quite a career from such a practice, though his lift jobs are usually from older, somewhat forgotten greats.  Hellboy just says to heck with this memory thing, and lets rip. To some extent this makes for a crowded movie.  In contrast, look how Spiderman makes much of just one super villain per movie.<br /><br />Perlman is excellent as Hellboy. He plays the part like some orange, mutant looking, cigar chomping, Sgt. Fury.  Also of note, is Liz (played by the lovely Selma Blair) as the Firestarter.  She's just one of those actresses that has \\"It,\\" just by being on screen (see: Scarlet Johansson).  The story is basically a comic book, the violence, bloodless.  You got those reliable bad guys, the Nazis (with some help from Rasputin) seeking to open up another world and let the tentacled baddies come rolling in (very Cthulu Mythos by the way).  Hellboy slugs and wisecracks his way through the evil mumbo jumbo, while keeping a protective eye out for his beloved Liz, who can take care of herself in a very explosive way.  That's pretty much it.  Nothing great, but definitely worth a watch.
B0001AP12G|5.0|my god!!!  The best album of the year. As essential to the game as THE CHRONIC was back in the day.   Feelin this album here in oz and people here (mostly) have no idea about this lad.  Buy 2 cds, you will need the 2nd when the first cd gets stolen.  KANYIZZY U GENIUS
0743243315|1.0|What a bore. This book does not live up to the hype. Its incredibly slow to start and it doesn't get any better. It just drags along. I didn't actually finish the book. That's how terrible it is. All that I can say is that this book is terrible, and if you must read it please don't buy it. Go to your local library.
B000005JA8|5.0|I bought Trout Mask Replica from a bargain bin at Rhino Records (way before it was a label) in Westwood in 1971. The _only_ reason I bought it was that I saw Frank Zappa's name on it as producer. I listened to Record 1 Side 1, I said, ``Whaa?'' and put the album in the back row of my collection for one year. (I did the exact same thing for Pierre Boulez' le marteau sans maitre, by the way.) When I listened for the second time, I listened to the music and didn't let the wierdness get the better of me. I have since ground down the grooves of three vinyl albums, until I got the current CD. It's a matter of understanding it, of &quot;getting it&quot; - I don't mean &quot;getting it&quot; like a joke, but becoming aware of the logic and compositional technique underlying the chaos. Many Beefheart fans said ``Whaa?'' at first. If you do, just put it away for a while, don't toss it in the garbage. Once you get it, you'll be amazed over and over and over again. Harmonies, rhythms and poly-rhythms, textures and lyrics the like of which the world has never heard before, or since. This is chamber music for rock band. It is delicious.
B00005JLXE|4.0|the tough thing about turning daredevil into a movie is trying to get all the stuff that people love about him and his world into the movie version. d.d. has changed so much and new stuff keeps coming both into his present and into his past. it would have been oh so easy for this movie to have completely missed the mark but it seems the great comc book gods (lee, kirby, colan...) were smilin' down 'cause this movie strikes the target almost dead center. it's a little off but considering the 40 years and counting of source materials that ain't bad. plus i think this is a cut version. the original probably really got it right. lets see that one. for all it's iffy moments this movie gave us characters with heart and it entertained me big time. plus it was made by a true fan. i gotta love it.
B00000JY1X|5.0|I bought this box set the day it hit the streets and I just can't stop listening to it.  At least one of the three CDs is in my CD player during the week, playing loudly.   <br /> <br />When Stephin first wrote a song and sang it - - it's like Cole Porter was re-incarnated for a new generation. <br /> <br />I get chills when I hear this music. <br /> <br />If you like being in love, falling in love, feeling melancholy about love . . . do yourself a huge favor - - <br />go to your local independent record store and fork out the dough for this delicate gem.
B000286S8S|4.0|I'm so sick and tired of everyone knocking Sammy and his reunion with Van Halen.He was the best lead singer out of the 3 singers they had.At least Sammy still has his voice.David sounds like crap now.He is really starting to show his age.Where was Dave when Sammy was out with the Waboritas?????? He was nowhere to be found.Van Halen did the right thing when they asked Sammy to come back.This album rocks, and so do the new songs!!!!
B000002HPV|5.0|Approaching this tour de force as separate tracks on a CD is wrong. My first experience was with a tape. I love tapes. They don't let you casually skip ahead.  <br />  <br /> And on tape, straight through, this darkness will creep forward, dance with you. Then, the moment Pluto arrives in an orgy of anger and erratic energy something occurs: The silence between the angry beats is the actual beat. You hear it in your head. It's the dark of pure annihilation. Wish for death in the silence. Wish to throw the CD away. <br />  <br /> Ah, but Isobel returns to lull you back to hope. The last track is the victory of hope over despair. The song of the strings holds steady long past the despair of the beat. The lingering notes of All is Full of Love will take you beyond the pain and anguish and bad noises. <br />  <br /> This is the evolution of Isobel, Bjork's alter-ego, through painful, earth-shattering experiences, where silence and dissonance rise up through the album.  <br />  <br /> She went Hunting, you see. She went out into the vast expanse of Gondry's Artistic Iceland (the Joga video), and found those Goods.  Unfortunately, part of finding the goods is dealing with pain and death and anguish.  (sidenote: CHECK OUT THE GONDRY/BJORK VIDS!!) <br />  <br /> She brings back hope, and love.  You see, even the pain is part of the good.  For they who know love, also know pain.  Bjork's personal life building up to this album tells you that much, doesn't it?  <br />  <br />Bjork knows it, and so do I. People who fall in love alot, also fall out of love alot.
1582432678|5.0|This book is so amazing.  I had it for about a month before I actually got into reading it.  Since I bought it, I took a highlighter to all the parts I liked, and it ended up that page and page again were highlighted.  There are parts you just cringe at, because how could a child be this same devastating way since birth?  How did Eva get through it all?  And now, I know what a small-eared elephant shrew is.  It deals with the opposite view, which gave to greater enjoyment.  I must say Lionel Shriver just doesn't know how big of an impact it has made on me.  I will eventually get all of my friends to read it. Thank god for books like this. You better read it.
0385336810|3.0|This book was enjoyable for a &quot;beach book&quot; type read. It could have been more enjoyable had I never read any of the other Sophie Kinsella novels. Like other readers have said, this book is similar to the Shopaholic series in both style and tone. I did enjoy the concept of the novel and found it to be funny. I think it will make a great romantic comedy film and the movie will turn out to be better than the book.
B000286S8S|1.0|Oil and water mix better than Roth and Hagar tunes. Combining these two era's is like mixing Jack Daniels with bar brand tequila. It's both nausiating and insulting to the taste buds. There should have been two greatest hits by this band and no more. One as the mighty Van Halen and another as Van Hagar. Even though I believe in only one Van Halen (that died in 1985), I still would have purchased the Hagar tracks with Ed on guitar just out of curiosity. This is the second time that this band has stuck it to the fans with a bad mixture plus three new turds to flush. Also, the Roth tunes that were butchered by Hagar from the not so live cd (if you call re-recording Roth songs in a studio and over dubbing the crowd in live) &quot;Right Here Right Now&quot; serve no purpose except to throw the finger to Roth and old school VH fans. If you are a completist, then complete your VH collection with this. Otherwise, save yourself and run away as fast as you can.
B00004XONN|5.0|I think this album, like all Radiohead albums, needs to be listened to death before you get the full scope of the music. This is due in part to the fact that Radiohead music is layered and complex and although Kid A is their most minimalist album, it still requires multiple listenings to fully ingest. <br />This CD is perfect for late nights driving home or while writing (I do quite a bit). It's hard to believe that the same recording sessions spawned both Kid A and Amnesiac and I don't think they would both be such great albums if the songs were not chosen so carefully for both albums. <br />Excellent for die-hard Radiohead fans (like myself) but newcomers to the sound may appreciate OK Computer or The Bends a little more.
B0001XAPX8|5.0|This movie is at least as much about the past as it is about the present; the past receives virtually equal screen time through flashbacks. Certain reviewers have complained that it is 'pompous', I suppose because it takes place in a college environment, or that both Anthony Hopkins and Nicole Kidman are miscast. It concerns a classics professor, age 71, African American though nearly white in appearance, who is falsely accused of racism and quits in protest; this event kills his wife; he soon becomes involved with a distinctly intellectually inferior woman whom, through sex and other forms of communication, he soon comes to consider his soul mate, despite opposition both from his lawyer and from her boorish former husband. It is in fact a good match, between an intelligent man who is somewhat over the hill physically and a vital young woman whose former husband and 2 dead children would make anyone cry. Ed Harris is superbly evil as her insanely jealous ex-husband who knows she is having sex with another man. Faunia is a somewhat pitiable character, not too bright, who works as a cleaning woman. There is also a writer who is hired to write Coleman's biography. Faunia's chain smoking, which is sometimes gratuitous in Hollywood movies, in this case is effective in defining her character.      At least half the movie concerns Coleman's young manhood, during which time he rejected his African American family and set out to live life as white, and Jewish. These flashbacks show him as a successful undefeated boxer in his youth and also reveal an affair he had with a college student of Scandinavian descent.     In the present he still considers himself white and cannot bring himself to reveal his past, although it might have saved his job. The lovers die in a car accident, which provides the forum for more reminiscences on Coleman's life. I thought this was a fine film and deserved a strong 4 stars.
B000286S8S|1.0|I'm sorry....I was drunk. Don't know what I was dri...er, I mean THInking but...once again...I fudged it. You're all right...I SHOULD have got Roth back. Did you actually HEAR sammies lyrics....lol. Man I gotta quit with the boozin..lol.
6305313687|5.0|If you are a fan of Norton buy this movie, by far his best performance.  The story is about redemption, and is highly powerful, and thought and heart provoking.  The violence isnt really that bad compared to saving private ryan, but is still shocking.  The drama is heart wrenching, and the movie makes you think.  The ending is trajec, from beginning to end you think and feel mixed emotions, but in the end you are sad but still feel good, seems strange right.  Its an very important film that explains alot, and should be viewed because it matters.  9 out of a 10.
B000092T6M|5.0|This great retelling of the legendary tale of Robin Hood, the evil Sheriff of Nottingham, and the fair Maid Marion is a great addition to any DVD library. This \\"closer to history\\" version of the fabled story starts in Jerusalem during the 4th Crusade where we find Kevin Costner as Robin of Locksley, imprisoned with his friend, the brother of Maid Marion. Soon they escape but without the loss of one life and the salvation of another. Robin, along with Morgan Freedman, as his companion, find their way back to England where Robin finds that the King, away on the Crusade, is in danger of losing his crown to the Sheriff of Nottingham. <br /> <br />The cinematography of the countryside and castles of England are well worth this DVD as the movie showcases the beauty of the forests and landscape of England. The costumes and sword fighting are also highlights that should not be overlooked. <br /> <br />This DVD is special in that it is the extended version of the theatrical released movie so there are a couple of added scenes. One to note is the scene when the witch Mortania explains to the Sheriff about his real mother. This was a scene that should have been kept in the original movie and adds to the better understanding of both these characters. Other extras include the score of the movie and early interviews with the stars prior to the movie's release. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.
0448060191|5.0|If recommending a classic novel to someone who wants to read examples of good writing, no recommendation would be complete without the addition of Little Women, and the four March sisters; Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy.  It is a story about the devotion of these four young sisters to each other, to their family, and to their friends. No matter what the age, all of us must learn to endure the obstacles that life will throw us.  So it is in this story. Although originally written in 1898, this novel transcends time.  Alcott weaves the story of these sisters as they search for love, security, peace, and happiness. \\"Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents,\\" grumbled Jo, lying on the rug.  So begins this richly written story. Even if you have seen the movie, do try reading this beautiful classic.  Perhaps we can learn a thing or two from a classic writer. <br /> <br />It transcends all time.  It doesn't matter if the time frame is the late 1800's; good writing is good writing, which should lead to good reading.  Louisa May Alcott was so ahead of her time in writing about spirited, independent women in a time when it was not fashionable to be so.  If you liked this book, you may want to refer to other books by Alcott, but I still believe this is by far her best. <br /> <br />
B00006879E|2.0|I was wrestling with my CD tower the other day, and I was hit on the head by a cd. I scratched my head, and picked up what had just scraped my forehead with and it just happened to be Jamiroqui, I put it in the CD player and realized something. Maroon 5 might be a talented band, but they are no Jamiroqui, and those who think so, I challenge you to go pick up a Jamiroqui CD, one I've been listening to for 8 years. I'm not about talking crap on bands really, but come on now, I just dont see how people can go off about how &quot;original&quot; Maroon 5 are, when Jamiroqui was doing this stuff 10 years ago, and I hate to say it but with a little more &quot;soul&quot;.
B00008EY65|2.0|This movie was ruined for me in the first five minutes and I will tell you why...THE NAZIS WERE NEVER IN SCOTLAND! Jesus, I would not have cared if every other aspect of the film was fictitious if they had only enough common sense to make the setting of the opening act somewhat plausible.<br /><br /> For the rest of the movie I just kept thinking:
1400032717|5.0|By turns heartwarming and heartbreaking, Haddon's book explores new territory -- that of an autistic fifteen-year-old boy seeking to make sense of an emotionally complex world.  Literal and logical, mathematically-gifted, Christopher sees each day as a puzzle to be solved, just as he sees the curious death of a neighbor's dog as a mystery worthy of his detective work.  His notes become this book.    Often the world is too dense with detail.  He recoils from overload and withdraws to protect himself: by hiding, groaning to block out stimuli, rocking, losing himself in mathematical puzzles, and even hitting others to forestall their unwanted advances.  He avoids crowds, being touched, the colors yellow and brown, metaphors and jokes.  So long as he can render a day by a concrete timetable, he can navigate relatively unthreatened.    Sadly, his world is altered in ways beyond his grasp when he discovers what really happened to the dog, as welll as his father and mother.  He seeks protection in the only way he knows, and somehow finds his way to a train that takes him to London, evading police and other well-intentioned folks along the way.  In the end, he has arrived as close to home and understanding as he can get.    Haddon has written a remarkable book.  That he can tell this tale from the point of view of Christopher is a staggering achievement.  That he can maintain an emotionally detached voice while generating such emotion for the reader is incredible.    I recommend this book highly, and I recommend it in relation to another remarkably touching work, THE DOGS OF BABEL.
B0000035E7|4.0|I think this is the 3rd best LP Nirvana has released, but some of it's songs are their best performances. With many catchy songs like Blew, School, and Negative Creep, this is a very good debut. <br />  <br /> Blew 5/5 - A good starter for the album, very catchy, and is very fun to listen to. <br />  <br /> Floyd the Barber 3/5 - I never really enjoyed this song until I read the lyrics. I'm sort of impatient, and this song made me want to skip, but I had more appreciation for it after reading the lyrics (even though they are disturbing) <br />  <br /> About A Girl 5/5 - This was my favorite on the album when I first heard it, but I've grown a little sick of it. It's still a great and catchy song though, I just prefer Blew and Scoff over it. <br />  <br /> School 5/5 - People will probably say it is too repetitive, but I think it is great. Again, a very catchy song. <br />  <br /> Love Buzz 5/5 - You'll be humming this song.. catchy and good. I like the intro. <br />  <br /> Paper Cuts 4/5 - This was like Floyd the Barber for me.. I'm sort of impatient, and this song is just slow. I would've given it a 3/5, but like Floyd the Barber, I appreciated it more and paid more attention while I was going along with it reading the lyrics. Very good song. <br />  <br /> Negative Creep 5/5 - It's another song that one might call repetitive, but it is still very catchy and a good song. <br />  <br /> Scoff 5/5 - Another one that could be repetitive, but is still probably the catchiest song on the album. The way Kurt says &quot;Gimme back my alchohol&quot; makes the song shine. <br />  <br /> Swap Meet 4/5 - I overlooked this one because it was after two of the best songs on the album, but is still good. <br />  <br /> Mr. Moustache 4/5 - Good, but something in it is missing.. <br />  <br /> Sifting 4.5/5 - This song is like a cross between Paper Cuts and Scoff. It starts out slow, and it made me impatient, wanting to skip it, but when I read the lyrics for the verse I grew moreappreciative. The only thing that made me come back to this track was &quot;Don't have nothing for you&quot; which reminds me of Scoff because it repeats that line like he does with &quot;Gimme back my alchohol.&quot; <br />  <br /> Big Cheese 5/5 - Wow, this is a cool song. The intro reminds me of Jaws, and I like how they took that and made it part of the song. Very catchy, and a great song. <br />  <br /> Downer 4.5/5 - This is a pretty good song.. This song reminded me of System Of A Down. It sounds a lot like something they would do, and it's a political song, which is usually the topic that SoaD aims for in most of their songs. It's different from the other songs, and I like it a lot. <br />  <br /> Overall, my favorite tracks would have to Blew and Scoff, my least favorite being Floyd The Barber. I could still go through the album and enjoy every track, though. Floyd the Barber is good, just not great. <br />  <br /> If you haven't heard anything from Nirvana though, try Nevermind first. Come back for this one after you listen to Nevermind. <br />  <br /> This is not their best album, but has most of their best songs. It would be the best if they took out or replaced a few tracks. A good debut nonetheless, you should get it.
B000000P17|4.0|I've only ever heard a friend's copy of this record, as I am a sworn GNR-hater (no offense). I can say that it's their only tolerable album in my view, because I love the songs they cover (some of em). I just wrote this review to tell people who originally did these songs (the ones i know), so you can go get those versions. <br /> 1. &quot;Since I Don't Have You&quot; - i dunno who did this <br /> 2. &quot;New Rose&quot; - The Damned. Get &quot;Damned Damned Damned&quot; <br /> 3. &quot;Down on the Farm&quot; - UK Subs. Get &quot;Before You Were Punk: Best of&quot; <br /> 4. &quot;Human Being&quot; - don't ask me <br /> 5. &quot;Raw Power&quot; - Iggy & the Stooges. Get &quot;Raw Power&quot; <br /> 6. &quot;Buick Makane&quot; - c'mon, i don't know <br /> 7. &quot;Hair of the Dog&quot; - apparently a band called Nazareth did this, but i've never heard of 'em. The Ramones have a different song of the same name, though, so get that, on &quot;Animal Boy.&quot; <br /> 8. &quot;Attitude&quot; - The Misfits. Get &quot;Static Age&quot; <br /> 9. &quot;Black Leather&quot; - Sex Pistols. I don't know where you can get THIS song, but you should get the &quot;Bollocks&quot; or the &quot;Swindle.&quot; <br /> 10. &quot;You Can't Put Your Arms 'Round a Memory&quot; - Johnny Thunders. Get &quot;So Alone&quot; <br /> 11. &quot;I Don't Care About You&quot; - Fear. Get &quot;The Record&quot; <br />  <br />  <br />
B0000073I5|5.0|Before he formed his side project Mike + The Mechanics in 1985, Genesis bassist/guitarist Mike Rutherford recorded a pair of solo albums, and 1979's &quot;Smallcreep's Day&quot; was the first. Being Rutherford's solo debut, it was only natural that the album would sound a lot like Genesis in parts, but hey, there's nothing wrong with that! Mike recruited his old Genesis friend Anthony Phillips (the band's original guitarist) to play keyboards on the album, along with drummer Simon Phillips (no relation) and lead singer Noel McCalla. The end result is a brilliant album, with terrific compositions, performances, and production all the way around. Personal faves include the powerful rock of &quot;Moonshine&quot; and &quot;Overnight Job,&quot; the beautiful &quot;Every Road&quot; and &quot;Time And Time Again,&quot; and of course, the epic title rock suite, comprising tracks one to seven on the CD, including the thunderous &quot;Working In Line,&quot; the bouncy &quot;Cats And Rats (In This Neighborhood),&quot; and the lovely finale, &quot;At The End Of The Day,&quot; showing that Mike hasn't forgotten his &quot;Supper's Ready&quot; days in Genesis. Although it would take him until the formation of Mike + The Mechanics to *truly* step out of Genesis' shadow, &quot;Smallcreep's Day&quot; is an outstanding first solo step for Mike Rutherford.   (NOTE: the CD version of &quot;Smallcreep's Day&quot; flips around the two halves of the album, *beginning* with the &quot;Smallcreep's Day&quot; suite, which was actually Side Two of the original vinyl release. So, if you'd like to hear the album as Mike originally intended, begin the CD with track 8 (&quot;Moonshine&quot;), and when the disc ends, start the CD at the top to hear the second half. Maybe you won't care, but that's how *I* like to play &quot;Smallcreep's Day&quot; on my CD player.)
B0001NBMBC|1.0|Ok this album is such a disappointment I don't know where to start. I first heard of Slipknot when my friend's cousin (bigfat john) had a burned cd off the internet that he claimed &quot;Had heavy metal, funk and rock elements, with the occasional death metal growl.&quot; That album was called &quot;Mate, Feed, Kill, Repeat&quot; and I was amazed by the musicianship they displayed, and Anders had such a crunchy growl it was fitting for the music. For a long time I didn't hear from them and thought they broke up or something. Bigfat John later introduced me to their Selftitled album which had a different singer but the music was still awesome. It was a nice mix of rock and metal, nothing really heavy but still the musicianship could not be ignored, it was that good. But then I heard &quot;wait and bleed&quot; on the radio and it was completely watered down, that p*ssed me off right there, it was like listening to Country-tallica or some other sellout radio b*tch band. I was angered but not deterred. Then IOWA came out... That was pushing it for me, &quot;left behind&quot; is probably the worst song ever written, and because of the lack of material they ended up covering songs from MFKR!! WTF! And the other single from IOWA was just as watered down as &quot;Wait and Bleed.&quot; That was the beginning of the end for the Knot. Then Stonesour came back together and I didn't like them in 92 and they still suck now. But if a whinning is all Corey had to get out of his system to be angry again cool. But that wasn't the case at all. Now there's this, it's not even the fact that the album is slow and soft(obviously corey forgot he's in the &quot;other&quot; band now), it's the fact that the song structures and lyrics give off the feeling that this album was written and recorded in about an hour. &quot;I'm a poet and I don't know it&quot;????? I wrote deeper stuff than that when I was in middle school, and the &quot;verse chorus verse&quot; thing has been played out for a fewyears now, you can't get more basic than that. Some really, really heavy bands do soft albums and the turn out is usually good. Like death metal legends Opeth and their latest release &quot;Damnation&quot; which is so well written and composed it makes the most hardened death metal head appreciate it. There's thought and passion put into the music, that is what Vol. 3 lacks. &quot;Duality&quot; is like a joke with no punch line, the video is hilarious with all the little angry children. Aww[...] And &quot;Pulse of the maggots&quot; is just a recycled IOWA song, they weren't even trying with that one! It's like a spit in the face to all their true &quot;maggot&quot; fans. Some people have the nuts to say that they are &quot;death metal&quot; which is a bigger joke than that pedophile Jackson guy. Slipknot even in their prime couldn't compare to bands like Cannibal Corpse, Myrkskog or Origin. So that theory is out of the question, Slipknot is now a pop music band like N*Suck or Brittney Spears, something little kids like because of the &quot;cool&quot; masks and &quot;angry&quot; noise they make. They should've stopped after &quot;S/T&quot; and left on a high note than by dragging their name through the mud like a turd wrapped in burnt hair. Because that's all they are now and this album is proof.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|Bill Murray displays some good comedic range in this comedy, but it is certainly not in the vein of a goofball Bill Murray comedy like Caddyshack or Kingpin. Instead, writer/director Sofia Coppola's humor is frequently so deadpan and understated, that if you're not paying strict attention (which I wasn't after the first hour), you will miss some of the film's funnier moments.        Murray's character is a tragicomic character, isolated in a foreign land without family or friends and both loving and hating it. Scarlett Johannsen's character brings some interest to the film, although her character's relationship with her on-screen husband (Giovanni Rubisi) is sadly underdeveloped, and the film ends on a note of ambivalence, not unlike my feelings towards the film.        While there is obviously some cross-cultural and situational humor, most is worthy of only a momentary chuckle. In fact, the entire theme of the film seems moodily subdued, as if the entire cast and crew of the film secretly had its water drugged with a depressant. The film itself is comedy on valium, and while it was a diverting and entertaining viewing experience with a few subtle messages on relationships and fame, I cannot understand the Oscar nominations. Above average film? Yes. Worthy of an academy award. (Yawn) No.
B00006879E|3.0|Maroon 5's Songs About Jane was released in June 2002 and it took a long climb into the top ten peaking at number seven earlier this year. The album is a mix of bluesy, white soul music with a dash of funk throw in. The band has a strong and slick musicianship and lead singer Adam Levine has a pretty decent voice. Mr. Levine is a romantic at heart and his lyrics are ripe with obsessions about beauty and lust. The first single from the album &quot;Harder To Breathe&quot; shows the band's soulful side while &quot;Shiver&quot; is in the funk-blues vein. &quot;Must Get Out&quot; is a slow, pretty song. The album's best track and a truly great single is &quot;This Love&quot;. The song has a pumping, sing-along chorus, funky guitar riff and pounding piano that create a real, old-fashion soul rave-up. The rest of the album is solid, but not spectacular.
B00000JCB2|4.0|This CD is awesome. Break Stuff kicks everthing around. The CD contains a Rap/Metal mixture. If you like Linkin Park, Korn, or Papa Roach you'll love this CD.
B000002534|5.0|I have so many Santana cds in my collection, yet this is probably my favorite.  Not many folks have even heard this 1974 release.  I have been listening to this recording for the last 30 years and it never gets old on me!!  Carlos is a genius!!  This cd is dreamy, vibrant, intriguing, intellectual, and deep.  Buy it, Buy it, Buy it!!!!!
B00024BHTC|5.0|I think many people who doesn't know Nightwish, can't understand this album. It's true is different from the other Nightwish albums, but not bad. CENTURY CHILD, had a different sound with with new vocals and a distortion sound from the bassist , but the result wasn't so definite than ONCE. It's fresh, with killer riffs guitar, a great symphonic orchestration, Tarja voice still sound sweet and deep, and  Marco voices have a better feeling in this album.
B00005JN2F|5.0|This is a fantastic thriller, albeit a tad heavy on the car chases, but not so much that it takes away from the utter enjoyment of seeing Matt Damon reprise his role as Jason Bourne, CIA assassin-turned amnesia victim with a conscience.<br /><br />As the movie opens, Bourne and his girlfriend are living an idyllic existence off the radar on the coastline of India (beautiful photography, by the way). But Bourne has a sixth sense that he is being watched--despite his girlfriend's annoyance. And he is right. Somebody in Germany has committed a major political crime and managed somehow to leave Bourne's fingerprints at the scene. Bourne is being stalked by just about everybody, from the CIA to the FBI to the bad guys on the other side.<br /><br />As the tension builds, Damon performs brilliantly as a guy who just wants to be left alone--but whose survival skills, finely honed in another lifetime, come to the fore, complete with murder and mayhem.<br /><br />I hope Damon continues with this series. This entry was finely acted, beautifully photographed and edited, and just pure escapist fun.
038073186X|5.0|My only complaint? That it was longer so I could look forward to reading it tonight (finished it in 5 sittings). Lehane creates such vivid characters and scenes that you can't help but get involved. I loved Mystic River, so I thought I'd give this one a shot and I wasn't disappointed.  If you enjoy psychological thrillers with many twists, then this a must read.
B0001ADAVK|4.0|This movie would probably have never been financed without Julia Roberts as the lead but it suffers as a result of this.     The story is pretty solid, the art direction was very good, the costumes, makeup (except for Julia's) and soundtrack were all well done and the writing was worthy of an academy award nomination. But to cast Julia Roberts in a period piece like this did a disservice to the writers and fellow actors in this movie.       Had they cast anyone else in the lead role they might have had an award winning movie. Don't get me wrong, I like Julia, but she seems incapable of acting in any period piece and was definitely not fit for the fifties OR this movie.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|My husband and I never heard of Gavin before a friend introduced us to his music. Since then, we've had an epiphany that Gavin is likely the most gifted musician in our day, if not of all days. Now we can't stop listening to his songs and any of their variations! His music is so captivatingly original and refreshing; he is indubitably a musical prodigy. You must buy this CD and understand that you will be a changed person after hearing his music.
B00005JM0B|5.0|With the exception of a few franchises, most sequel films are a resounding disappointment.  I was worried about this fact when I heard of Terminator 2, but it delivered.  The plot was a radical change from the 1984 classic, but it was pure entertainment.  So when I saw that Terminator 3 was being filmed, I was hopeful that it would deliver as well, and I wasn't disappointed. <br /> <br />If you're looking for something dramatic, or cerebral, it's not here.  However, it has good character development, a great script that is well-acted, plenty of action and adventure, some tongue-in-cheek humor, and special effects that are sure to please.  This is truly a guilty pleasure. <br /> <br />Detractors from Schwarzenneger films complain about his wooden performances, but this works in his favor in the Terminator series.  Nick Stahl and Claire Danes comprise the rest of the trio of lead protagonist actors, and each of them give convincing and well-emoted performances.  Kristanna Loken is the villian and effectively delivers an unemotional Terminator-like performance, although submitting to a gratuitous posterior nude shot that slightly detracts from the film; however, Arnold did the same thing although his posterior remained in the shadows, thankfully. <br /> <br />In short, if you enjoyed the original and the sequel, this film will not disappoint.  I hope that the trend will continue with Terminator 4.
0060536292|5.0|Continuing where Charlie and the Chocolate factory left off, this book takes you through Charlie and his family's further adventures with Willie Wonka.  See how Charlie and Willie Wonka take the Great Glass elevator where no man has gone before (well, almost).  See how they even give the U.S. space program a helping hand as they help save some unwitting astronauts and the new Space Hotel U.S.A. staff from certain death from a hitherto unknown menace from space.  After this, can Charlie and Mr. Wonka rescue Grandma Georgina from Minusland without getting themselves subtracted in the process?  Suspend your disbelief, sit back, relax and find out how it all comes together--or not. <br /> <br />Eric Idle's narration is great.  Thanks to him and Harper for recording this book!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I never used to be a fan of slipknot, for reasons unknown... but then I heard of Duality from a friend, and then the following day I seen it on Channel [V]. So the day after that! I bought this album... I can't get enough of them now! This is my first album of theirs, and I love it. It truly is both brutal and beautiful. I have heard that this is their worst album too... so I'm guessing their previous albums must be that damn good!  <br />My Favourite song has to be The Nameless, which reminds me of Soilwork, who are high-quality metal! If you haven't heard of them, check them out if you also like this song!! My second favourite song is Duality, which has a tormenting film clip that I enjoy watching.  <br />Other Favourites: <br />The Opium of the People  <br />Vermilion pt.1 and 2 and <br />Before I Forget. <br />
B0000931OG|3.0|When Think Tank first came out, I was greatly turned off by the morbid cover art and explicit content patch. I thought one of my favorite groups had turned into some sort of crappy death metal band. Thankfully they didn't go that far, but I do think that Think Tank is a prime example of a great band struggling to create something magnificent and groundbreaking out of nothing. Up until Think Tank, I knew I could always listen to a Blur album and hear wry, intelligent lyrics, catchy riffs and many polished, infectious melodies. Now though, Blur comes off as a sullen, anti-establishment Radiohead impostor. Songs like Country House, On Your Own, Boys and Girls, You're So Great and Coffee and TV are songs that I think show what Blur is all about. Nothing from this new album stays with me like these older tracks. Everything from the dull opener Ambulance to the maudlin closer Battery In Your Leg is more or less watered down and lacking in the kind of vigorous musicianship that usually abounds in most Blur recordings. A few exceptions that I think are very cool tunes include the haunting Caravan, the long, rambling experimentation of Jets and the surprisingly sweet Sweet Song. I'll give Think Tank three stars for three good songs, but other than that, stick to Parklife or The Great Escape.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|The Alien Quadrilogy is the most amazing box set ever created,  if you over look the cheap packaging that is trouble to unfold and lets hair and dust in.  I have heard complaints from other costomers that the disks are scratched and of poor quality, however I did not encounter this problem, but I'm not at all surprised.  The set is expensive-yes, poorly packaged-yes, worth it-yes.  This set gives you two versions of every movie (Alien 3's is espetially good) and each movie has a second disk with the making of featurettes, as well as, of course a cheezy ninth disk thrown in there (hey, im not complaining!)and a manual (however if you're one of those major Alien fans with way too much time on your hands, like me, you will find the manual leaves out characters and has Raines and Junior, from alien 3, mixed up). You also need to be 18 to buy the set or else you need to take yaw mommie wiff you (thank you so much movie advisory board!).  However once you get the set home it is the most rewarding experience to unfold the set to reveal over FIVE FEET of great Alien DvD's (and cheap plastic and cardboard casing help together by cheap glue). But it isn't the packaging that makes a movie pack, its the movies, and every DvD is worth it! They are the greatest DvD's for you Alien fans with so much extra crap that you could sit there watching it for 96 hours strait, going through each movie, its alternit version, its making of featurettes, its galleries, more featurettes for the first alien, more art, picture, storyboard and script galleries, and MORE!  Man, I'll never get bord of this set, I think I'll go watch the Alien 3 Special Edition! Bye! Oh, no Junior don't sacrifice yourself!  Run you fools! hahahahahahahaaaaa! Woohoo you can really hear the blood splatter!
B0002IQJUK|5.0|Whoa. This album has left me speechless. All I can say is everyone should buy it unless you have heart problems because Gavin will make your heart race and blow you away with this one! If you like pure, raw, fantastic talent.. then you want this cd! All of the live tracks are simply amazing and shows how he isn't just a CD artsit... Gavins the real deal. Get it... you won't regret it...you'll looooove it!
B00012FXB8|5.0|Alien 3 is the most under-appreciated of the Alien Saga. Let me start by saying if you didn't like alien 3, DON'T BLAME DAVID FINCHER (director)! This was Fincher's first big film he directed and he was pushed into its direction by FOX who really just wanted to continue the saga *cough greedy fat cats cough*. Fincher was pushed into the production with almost no script at all. Alien 3 was doomed since day 1, if you ask me, Fincher saved Alien 3, sure he had to make a few sacrifices (characters from Aliens) but If you ask me, Alien 3 is the best of all the Alien movies.      The movie raises a few questions: How did that egg get on the ship in the first place? How could they kill off two valuable characters like that? How could they just shave Ripley bald? Well i will now address the questions: First, the egg........um, my only explination is that the evil FOX executives put it there to keep the series going, as for the killing the Aliens characters, I already told you there was major script problems (this may also be an explination for the egg) but hey, who neads them? they would only slow Ripley down, especially that little nerd Newt, what kind of nick name was that? Oh and by the way, there were THREE characters from Aliens lost, what about Bishop? What is he chop alumminum? He was the best of the three which is probably why we got to see him later in the film. And as for Ripley being bald, the prison has a problem with lice, and what is everyone's problem, Ripley looks hot with a shaved head!      Alien 3 ruled because the more you watch it, the more you come to appreciate it, it uses great imagery such as the eclypse around the planet, the orange colour given off by the furnis, and Ripley's baldness, yes it serves a purpose- to show how she has lost everything dear to her, Hicks, Newt, her real daughter, and even her hair! The acting and drama is also very impressive (especially compaired to Resurrestion) and I absolutely love the music for this one, it is brilliant, the best music of any other Alien film      The chase scene, now that was amazing! Alien 3 had to be the scariest of the Alien series because all they could do was RUN! I mean how hard is it to survive an alien attack when you have a freakin flamer or smart gun? Now running around with nothing but a freakin pair of sizzors, thats suspensful, ha ha, &quot;don't hold it like that! hold it like this! your going to F______ kill someone you F______ moron!&quot; Some people complain about the cursing, but come on, your trapped in a prison with no weapons with a killer alien that could come out of the roof at any second! &quot;oh no i suredly hope the gosh darn alien doesn't woop my behind, boy i am jolly well scared out of my winches! wooo woo wooop wooop gee gee&quot; of course they are going to swear, they are a bunch of doulbe Y chromosone killers and rapists in a death situation! Its just realistic.      The alien was also sooooo cool, it was faster, swifter and scarier, and it came from a dog! The 'Bambi' burster was the coolest burster and guess who designed the alien and burster, ha ha, no its not james cammeron, it was H.R. Giger, the man who created the monster in Alien (as well as the eggs, the space jockey, the alien ship thing, the hugger and with help, the burster)! Alien 3 brought Giger back in the game after he was left behind in Aliens.       You also get a better look at all the stuff that had to be cut out if you view the 2003 Alien 3 special edition. MANY scenes had to be left behind that expanded on the characters, and also explains little things like what happened to Golic. Now lets talk special effects: many people diss the effects but you have to remember it was released in 1992, and Alien 3 opened the door for many other movie effects when it experimented with the alien puppet being subbed into the picture, the short but sweet computer graphics, and the Bishop android, yes it was a REAL robot!      Alien 3 was the darkest of the alien movies,it was a cult movie, only for certain people and i can understand if you don't like it, that is absolutley ok, BUT I DO, I DO! This movie had a killer climax, amazing ending and the best character of all survives. Morse! You rule Morse, woo go Morse! So give Alien 3 another chance, just because there were script problems and tight time constraints, doesn't mean this isn't a great movie, forget about the little things you didn't like and try to appreciate what the film accomplished, after all it has to lead up to 2 other amazing films and I am impressed that they still kept the plot original and different from the other films, and of course we get to witness more slaughter then any other of the Alien movies, and isn't that what Alien is really all about?
B000099T2L|5.0|Minutes after buying this cd, I took it home and listened to the entire cd, and ket me just say that Beyonce should strongly follow up this cd. The single &quot;Crazy In Love&quot; gives you a close look and her personal life. &quot;Baby Boy&quot; shows her sexual side. I also think that the single &quot;Me, Myself and I&quot; showed a more softer side to her. For the money, this cd is totally worth it. I hope that after Destiny's Child releases and tours for their upcoming cd, that Beyonce release a new solo cd. Trust me, I will buy it, if it anything like the first.
B00005JN7O|5.0|I can't wait for this movie to come out I think that it will be a really great movie.It has a great cast including Angelina Jolie,Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow.Angelina will play Franky Cook,Jude Law will be the Sky Captain, and Gwyneth Paltrow will play Polly Perkins a news reporter.
B00029NMRM|5.0|i thought this movie was extremely funny, better than the first one. maybe it was the slapstick and the wonderful job done by kevin pollack as lazlo. the character, strabo, was soooooooo funny too. i've seen this movie more than three times already and i just got it. if you want a good laugh i would get this movie.
B000002UAX|5.0|Despite what I'v heard from some people, the implied name of this album &quot;The White Album&quot; stands for purity and cleansing, not &quot;white pride&quot; or white supremacy or anything like that. Unfortunately, Charles Mansion didn't see it that way and stole a couple of the tunes. But really, this album's official title is &quot;The Beatles&quot; it was a self-titled album, cool huh?!<br /><br /> And as for old wild-eyed Charlie, he took Helter Skelter, which in all honesty, is a song about a children's slide! A helter skelter in England is what we here in America call a slide! So Mr. Murdering Manson, you used a song about a SLIDE as an anthem. Great choice.<br /><br /> Now as for the album, I find this one to be so relaxing! And incredibly multi-dimensional. All rolled into one is the greatest mix of Rock, Pop, Folk, Blues, Ballad, Classical, Experimental and Traditional that any music lover could possibly hope for! And the best thing is, it's all done by one band in one single year!<br /><br /> I think my favorites would have to be &quot;Dear Prudence&quot; which is a sweet song that John wrote to lure Mia Farrow's shy sister out of her room in India. Prudence wouldn't come out of her room the whole time she had been in India so John tried to coax her to come out and meet people.<br /><br /> &quot;Ob la di, Ob la da&quot;, a cute tune with a bouncy beat, used to be the theme song to a show my family watched when I was a kid.<br /><br /> the first part of &quot;Happiness is a Warm Gun&quot; which, by the way, is a raunchy song, NOT depressing as another reviewer thought.<br /><br /> Also &quot;Martha My Dear&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;I'm So Tired&quot; I believe this song is related to John's heroin addiction at the time, but it has a great beat and as usual, I love John's wording. And, if you play the noise at the very end backwards John says &quot;Paul is dead, miss him, miss him, miss him&quot;. Use your computer, use Sound Recorder, record the ending and then use this program to reverse it, it comes standard on every computer.<br /><br /> &quot;Blackbird&quot;, a song Paul wrote to encourage African American people downtrodden in the struggles of the Civil Rights Movement.<br /><br /> &quot;Rocky Raccoon&quot;, takes place in &quot;The Black Mining Hills of Dakota&quot; which is actually the Black Hills of South Dakota, cool song.<br /><br /> &quot;I Will&quot;, love this sweet tune, a friend of mine is going to use it for her wedding!<br /><br /> &quot;Yer Blues&quot; I like this one, more experimentation by John in a new genre. John, like many other Liverpool musicians, first heard American music via sailors coming back with the music, it influenced a generation.<br /><br /> &quot;Mother Nature's Son&quot;, very nice folkish song by Paul.<br /><br /> &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, already know the story here.<br /><br /> &quot;Long Long Long&quot;, I like this one by George, he was really making progress with his own music.<br /><br /> &quot;Honey Pie&quot;, I'm guessing this is an imitation of the music Paul's father used to play and listen to.<br /><br /> &quot;Cry Baby Cry&quot;, I love this one, I've always loved the melody and the jest at the affairs and exploits of royalty.<br /><br /> &quot;Goodnight&quot;, John originally wrote this for his son Julian, but rumor has it that he was too embarrassed to sing it himself so he gave it to Ringo to do. My own theory is that Yoko had something to do with him not singing it.<br /><br /> But all in all, this is one of my more favorite Beatles albums, it's good when you want to kick back and just listen and let your mind go. I always play &quot;Birthday&quot; on my birthday and on my friends' birthdays too. I honestly like all the songs on this album, I just HAD to name my favorites though. So, to do a cheap copy phrase, this album says: &quot;Don't pass me by!&quot;the ending and then use this program to reverse it, it comes standard on every computer. <br /> &quot;Blackbird&quot;, a song Paul wrote to encourage African American people downtrodden in the struggles of the Civil Rights Movement. <br /> &quot;Rocky Raccoon&quot;, takes place in &quot;The Black Mining Hills of Dakota&quot; which is actually the Black Hills of South Dakota, cool song.  <br /> &quot;I Will&quot;, love this sweet tune, a friend of mine is going to use it for her wedding!  <br /> &quot;Yer Blues&quot; I like this one, more experimentation by John in a new genre.

B00003CXCT|4.0|Okay, it's the age old debate, there are those fans of the old trilogy and those fans of the new trilogy. There are countless arguements as to why they shouldn't have been changed and what changing them did to the storyline. It doesn't matter which side you take, there is one simple fact: The Special Edition Trilogy will be the only version to ever be released on DVD.  <br />  <br /> Sure, I have problems with it, but it is essentially the films I grew up loving and I don't personally feel that my extensive DVD collection would be complete without it (Indiana Jones looks so lonely without Star Wars). People of all ages love these movies and the idea that a household would deny itself of Star Wars over a mere 1-3 minute alteration is, to me, absurd. Get over yourselves because boycotting the Special Edition Trilogy won't change a thing! If you want to yell at Lucas over something that can change, yell at him for not yet releasing Howard The Duck on DVD! If you are an avid Classic Trilogy fan and your skin crawls from the moment you see a non-transparent Star Destroyer in New Hope to the celebration on Coruscant in Jedi, then just buy the unliscenced Asian editions on Ebay (accepting all the risks involved, of course). For the rest of us, $42.00 is more than resonable for the trilogy on DVD AND A BONUS DISC! I remember seeing the bootleg trilogy on Ebay for around $100.00 when Episode II first came out! Lucas has never charged more than about $20 for the episodes 1 & 2 and only around $40 for the trilogy. He's not ripping us off, he's actually on par with a classic trilogy that's much better than most others on the shelves. Having said that, the only reason it recieved 4-stars instead of 5-stars is because he doesn't deliver both versions, he doesn't deliver a DTS track, and the fact it doesn't have the shotty christmas special and &quot;From Star Wars To Jedi&quot;. Even though I didn't expect them, they are what keeps this from being, in my opinion, a true 5-star boxed set.  <br />  <br /> As for waiting for a six-disc edition post Episode III, I'm not sure it'll be worth it. He's probably not going to do anything else with the original trilogy (listen to Lucas, folks, you'll never get the original on DVD!). Episode I & II have so many special features I doubt they'll ever expand, and Episode III won't be out until late next year! I'm sure if you wait a boxed set will come out, but it'll only be a packaged version of what we've already got. Go for it, it's okay, you spent nearly $30 to see the special edition trilogy in the theatre, everyone did! Drop another $40, get the trilogy, and stop fearing the mild possibility that you may have to purchase another boxed set in the next two years in order to get a few extra features you won't watch.
B00028HBKM|5.0|No movie in years has inspired half as much controversy as Mel Gibson's labor of love, the intimately religious movie &quot;The Passion of the Christ.&quot; A gritty, dark, bloody retelling of Christ's final hours, this takes the old cleaned-up Bible stories and throws them out. Instead, we have a vivid, shocking picture that you won't be able to forget.<br /><br /> This is, in essence, a cinematic passion play: We are shown Jesus's (Jim Caviezel) temptation by a surprisingly eerie Satan (Rosalinda Celentano), and his arrest by the Romans. His apostles flee away, leaving his mother Mary (Maia Morgenstern), follower Mary Magdalene (Monica Bellucci) to follow him on the road to where he would be crucified...<br /><br /> &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; was one of the unexpected hits of the last year -- it had a tiny budget, a seemingly small fanbase, and was made strictly according to the Catholic New Testament. But it struck a chord in people -- not just the subject matter, but the fact that Gibson was so dedicated. Much to Hollywood's surprise, people raced to see the controversial flick.<br /><br /> While some accuse Gibson of revelling in the gore, with a little bit of thought his &quot;Passion&quot;'s point comes through. It's horrifying to imagine a person -- let alone an incarnate god -- going through such horrors. But when it is realized what the point of all that suffering was for, it becomes a work of beauty. The biggest problem would be that Gibson spent little time on the idea of Jesus being resurrected, which was the whole point.<br /><br /> Jim Caviezel gives a stunning performance as Jesus Christ. Whether it's trying to pray through Satan's prattling or speaking to Mary and John from the cross, Caviezel brings every scene to life. Morgenstern is low-key wonderful as the sorrowful mother who has to watch her son killed by inches. And the beautiful Belucci is equally outstanding as the horrified Magdalene.<br /><br /> Yes, it's in Aramaic and Latin. But if the language doesn't hold you back, the beauty of the script can shine through. And Gibson's direction is equally stunning, utilizing rapid camerawork and plenty of flashbacks to make Jesus's struggle even more poignant. At times -- the table scene -- it's more than slightly awkward. But it's easy to forget that by the next scene.<br /><br /> It's a shock. It's a controversy. It's a one-of-a-kind film, based on a part of our culture that was underrated by Hollywood. It's Gibson's dark, bloody &quot;Passion of the Christ,&quot; and if you can watch something with some serious gore and straight-to-the-heart acting, then this is a must-see.amaic and Latin. But if the language doesn't hold you back, the beauty of the script can shine through.

B00005RERU|4.0|I picked this up after reading about it in the bios after Brando's death.  Great flick.<br /><br />Malden vs. Brando scenes are fantastic.  Malden makes such a great complex villian and Brando ranks right up there with James Dean as the ultimate rebel.<br /><br />Several stories in one flick.<br /><br />The friendship of Brando and the Mexican he excapes with.<br /><br />The revenge story.<br /><br />The pyschoanalysis of Malden's character and what happens to someone who betrays, not just a one dimensional character.<br /><br />The Slim Pickens vs. Brando subplot.<br /><br />The whole Ben Johnson bank robbery aspect.<br /><br />The love story.<br /><br />Unlike other reviews I read here, I thought Brando's love interest gave an excellent performance.  I'm glad the film resisted the cliches of Malden's final shot<br /><br />.....<br /><br />killing one of the main characters at the end.

0517220784|5.0|This book should be considered a required part of living. I was 11 when i first got into Sherlock Holmes, having found an old book in the attic, an original hardcover containing 4 stories and beautiful illustrations. I then pestered my mum for the omnibus of Sherlock Holmes which I read in 2 months (I was 11 after all) I didn't understand a lot of the words so i had my trusty pocket dictionary by my side. I couldn't ask my mum, she's a hairdresser. Even though i was on a little Spanish-speaking island called Tenerife, whenever I read the exciting tales of Holmes and his faithful friend Watson I was transported back to Victorian England and on the chase!   Now I'm 18, having visited the Sherlock Holmes museum in London and read sir Arthur Conan Doyles' other works, including theatre plays and parodies I can consider myself a complete Connoisseur.   If the only Holmes you know has been the televised version you don't know what you're missing. Get this book now!!!   But I worn you, its addictive reading so you might get a few shoes thrown at you to snap you out of it.
B00005QEPX|4.0|There are some songs that make the album a little dull. For example, the song Secretly repeats itself like over 10 times. The other ones seem to be on the safe side.
B0001ENYKS|3.0|This album is nice, fluffy Britpop. Unfortunately, that's all it is. The songs have the feel of Blur's debut album Leisure mixed with a healthy dose of funk and the Strokes yet leaving all of the soul at the door. <br />  <br /> Don't get me wrong, it would be fantastic fun to see these guys live. Their sound is full of vintage guitars and bouncy bass and Beatles reject call-out harmonies. <br />  <br /> However, singles &quot;Take me Out&quot; and &quot;Darts of Pleasure&quot; are much more sensual and catchy in six minutes than the rest of the album put together (although &quot;The Dark of the Matinee&quot; and &quot;40'&quot; are pretty good tunes). The album reminds me quite a bit of a Cake album or the Tenacious D album - a couple of great cathy tunes and some filler inbetween. While Blur or Oasis kept their albums thematic around the singles to create a cohesive hour of music, this comes off as thrown together like a collection of B-sides.
B00023BLXK|4.0|Seeing this movie makes me want to learn salsa dancing.  It is such a sensual and exotic dance that liberates the mind and the soul.  The best way to learn salsa would either be in person at the clubs or at home with dance instructional DVD's.  I actually bought one and would recommend it to anyone who is a beginner and wants to learn the steps quickly and easily.  The salsa dance DVD I got was by Salsacrazy.com. Learning how to salsa dance wasn't so hard afterall.  I hope you all will enjoy the fun.
B00019074O|5.0|On March 4 of this year, the newly elected mayor announced that she was changing the hiring practices of the city's police force.  No longer would height, weight, sex, education, or physical strength be used to keep new recruits out of the Metropolitan Police Academy.  Hundreds of people who never dreamed of becoming police officers signed up immediately.  Naturally, the police completely freaked.  -opening prologue of Police Academy.<br /><br />OK, so this is dated in terms of style and the chauvinism rampant in 80's comedies, but seeing it again for the first time in nearly twenty years brought back some nostalgic memories.  Granted, it's not an all-time classic, but hey, at least it's not as raunchy as American Pie.<br /><br />Diehards of the old school like academy chief and Lieutenant Thaddeus Harris work on a plan to make things tough for the new recruits, not by throwing them out but to make their training so miserable, they'll quit on their own accord.  Harris handpicks a Mutt-and-Jeff pair (both with crewcuts, no less) named Copeland and Blankes to help him weed out the scumbuckets, dirtbags, or whatever unpleasant name he has for the other recruits.  Yes, they'll learn about firearms, local laws, police procedure, and many many other things.  Well, it's mainly the first and last that happen in this classic 80's comedy.<br /><br />Then again, they were up against the likes of Carey Mahoney, the Monsignor Larvelle Jones, the suave lounge lizard George Martine, Leslie Barbara, Doug Fackler, and Tackleberry.  Mahoney is the main character and he's at the Academy as part of a deal with his friend Captain Reed, of a choice between the academy or the lockup for another minor offense.  And he can't quit as part of the deal-hence he tries to get himself kicked out by his antics.  For the most part, the main victim is Lieutenant Harris. The funniest moment involves Harris, a borrowed motorcycle, a parked car, and Harris flying into the air towards the rear end of a horse.  To which Mahoney says, \\"Someone call a veterinarian!\\"  Basically, some of the plot involves Mahoney pulling a prank on Harris, and either being called to Harris's office or being forced to do punitive exercises supervised by Harris or his handpicked student squad leaders, Copeland and Blankes.  However, Mahoney plays a real nasty and funny trick on those two involving the innocuously named Blue Oyster Bar.  And as for Commandant Lassard, that involves a funny moment at a podium.<br /><br />Larvelle Jones has to be my favourite character here.  He has an uncanny gift for sound effects, and when he and Mahoney first meet at the police station waiting room, he demonstrates his ability by imitating a machine gun.  Another one has him imitating the squishing sounds shoes make as the inspecting officer walks past the row of recruits on the academy lawn.<br /><br />Mahoney's roommate, Tackleberry, is a gung-ho type who wouldn't be out of place in Vietnam.  Call him a more comic version of Animal Mother in Full Metal Jacket.  He has guns that blow the heads off the firing range targets and his funniest moment involves the firearms drill, where he goes nuts.  When he says, \\"It's time this cop met the public,\\" watch out!<br /><br />But there are others.  Laverne Hooks, a short gentle black with a shy, timid voice, Doug Fackler, whose specialty is slapstick, mainly being clumsy at someone else's expense, Lesley Barbara, a chubby white guy and another timid soul, and Hightower, a quiet, towering black man who seems most likely to succeed, except for one thing that he needs help.  And this is one of Kim Cattrall's early films.  She plays Karen Thompson, Mahoney's love interest, at least when he's not asking her to bare her thighs.<br /><br />Steve Guttenberg (Mahoney), Michael Winslow (Jones), and David Graf (Tackleberry) boost this comedy, as does G.W. Bailey (Harris).  But the others are good too.  This is the best of the seven movie series.  Unfortunately, it all wentdownhill from there.ely, it all went downhill from there.

6305426694|5.0|Sometime in the late 1960's, a hideous act of pollution took place in Woburn, Massachusetts, a small town north of Boston.  Over the next fifteen years, twelve people died of leukemia.  Eight of those were children.  The firm of Jan Schlichtmann, Kevin Conway, James Gordon, and Bill Crowley take on the case on behalf of Anne Anderson, a woman who lost her child to cancer.  For her, money isn't the point.  All she wants to know is what happened, and for the responsible parties to come over and apologize to her and the other families.  Thing is, corporations apologize with money, and if the corporations have deep pockets, it's a case worth taking, so money does indeed become the point in A Civil Action.<br /><br />Schlichtmann uncovers the culprits, a chemical company, WR Grace and Beatrice Foods, who provide services for a tanning company owned by Riley.  With that, he files a lawsuit, the legal equivalent to a declaration of war, and hires a geological team to provide scientific evidence should it come to trial.<br /><br />Jan then does a couple things that leads to his downfall.  One, he gets personally involved.  In a news broadcast, he holds up snaps of the Woburn kids who have died.  He shows empathy, which is a grave disservice to the legal profession because it clouds his judgment.  He says it's like a doctor recoiling at the sight of blood.  That leads to his demanding of WR Grace and Beatrice Foods a multi-million dollar settlement, including money for a research foundation, to cover expenses, and to provide for the families for thirty years, which the corporations refuse, which in turn takes the case to trial.  He does this without consulting his partners, which doesn't bode well.  James Gordon, the accountant, points out that they need to work on other cases to provide a cash flow.  Schlichtmann has sunken a million into the Woburn case, and pretty soon, they teeter on the waterfalls of insolvency to the point of mortaging their homes.  It's become a source of pride, which has undone many an attorney as opposed to idiot witnesses, lousy evidence, and the hanging judge put together, as Jerome Fasher tells his law class.<br /><br />Fasher, the attorney for Beatrice, is a statesman-like man of experience, but has a detached air coupled with some eccentricities.  Yet he is a clever man, and his observation on the justice system is true, at times sickening.  When Schlichtmann tells him he's searching for the truth, he tells him, \\"You've been around long enough to know that a courtroom's not the place to look for the truth.\\"  And he accurately says that the case stopped being about children the moment Schlichtmann filed for action.<br /><br />The movie is sprinkled with legal commentary from Schlichtmann, which lays out how callous, ugly, and illogical the justice system is.  He begins by talking about which types of clients are worth more, i.e. are winning cases.  Whites are worth more than blacks, men more than women, a long agonizing death over a quick one.  A white male professional in his 40's, in his prime, is worth the most.  A dead child is worth least of all.  Well, Schlichtmann finds out that children are worth something after all, especially when he imagines an agonizing scene where the LaFierros were taking their son to the hospital and died en route.<br /><br />While John Travolta's best known for Grease and Saturday Night Fever, A Civil Action proves he can handle serious drama and he turns in one of his best ever performances.  However, the real Jan Schlichtmann came to Farmington.  He's close to seven feet tall, and in terms of resemblance, could've been played by Richard Gere.  As Anne Anderson, Kathleen Quinlan is the other great performer, playing a woman changed through her ordeal into someone who has a tired and sad visage.  The scene where Al Love (James Gandolfini), a conscience-stricken tannery employer personally apologizes to her shows that maybe the only real meaningful apologies come from humans, not corporations.<br /><br />Trials and lawsuits are examples of how corrupt and rotten the legal system and some lawyers are.  Is it worth having a system where the first party to come to their senses (i.e. to cut their losses and call for a settlement) is the loser?  A Civil Action also shows that despite the need for compassion, it's better to have a lawyer who thinks more with the head than the heart.rom humans, not corporations. <br /> <br />Trials and lawsuits are examples of how corrupt and rotten the legal system and some lawyers are.

0385335482|5.0|This book was great. I bought it because all my friends said it was a great book to read. I bought it along with other books from authors that I've read before. I read this book in two days. I couldn't put it down!!! I returned all the others and got the author's entire collection. I'm now reading &quot;Shopaholic Takes Manhattan&quot; and I am really happy with it so far. Becky (the main charcter) is very realistic. You can relate to her problems and you can't wait to see how she gets through it.
B000002BPS|5.0|Almost since I started getting into music in the 6th grade Offspring has been one of my favorite bands, starting with the first CD I heard by them, Americana. But as I went back to look at some of their previous work I came to realize that Americana, while a great CD, was deffinitly not their best. This CD or their first one are probably they best ones. <br /> <br />The best song on this CD is the single, Gone Away, and is about the loss of a loved one. This song is really well written and in some parts can be very intense. In the song one of the best moments is when Dexter say that if he could trade he would. That is a great line and just shows how important that person was to him. If you look at most of the Offspring albums at least before Conspiracy of one where everyting changed, you will usually find one song on the album about the lost of a loved one. <br /> <br />Another great song is I Choose. This song although it has a very happy tune is actually about somthing very serious. The song is about suicide, and he chose to take that path. It has a very good tune, a very fast tune, and again it just has very good lyrics which is somthing I look for in The Offspring, which is somthing they seem to have lost in the two newest albums. <br /> <br />There is one song on the album that is very stupid and doesn't really seem to stick well with the Offspring style, but if you are looking for a song that will not make you think you should deffinitly listen to the song Don't Pick It Up, this song is about many diffrent things that you should not pick up. It is kind've funny and a little bit disgusting, but still good. <br /> <br />But if you just love to hear their depressing songs about real life you should hear the song Way Down The Line. This song is about how parents, when they abuse thier children and screw up thier lives then those kids that get trated like that have a very big chance of turning into their parents way down the line. Very good song, but it might seemstupid at first if you don't give it half a minute to get moving. <br /> <br />So if you like well written music about real situations then this is the album for you. NUFF SAID.
B000068TP0|3.0|This is a good performance. The recently released Live dvd is much better though.
B00008EY65|4.0|I liked this movie for its straightforward plot, its characters, and its special effects.  The plot was simple: evil guys trying to destroy the world, and the good guys trying to stop the bad guys.  Nice if your tired out from a week of work and want to sit down and relax.  Its characters were relatively well-developed; Hellboy himself and the proffesor were done well, Rasputin was a little disappointing, and the 'fire-starter' was okay.  She could have used a little more developement, but I don't really see how it could have been incorporated into the movie without damaging the plot. The effects were excellent; convincing motion on the part of the hell-hounds.  I particularily liked Hell-boys tail.  It was just like a cat's tail in movement and was a nice touch.  I also thought that having Hell-boy miscalculate a jump between buildings was wonderful.  In the Matrix, Spiderman, etc characters are always capable of great leaps (both physical, mental, and social) but never over or undercalculate.  I would have actually given it a 3.5-star rating, but I can't with this rating system.  It loses points for lack of development for the evil characters and plot simplicity (I'm not always tired out and in search of simple action).  All in all a good movie and well-worth buying.
B0002S65W2|4.0|this is a fun movie and I loved Halle Berry in her role. There are some scary parts and I liked the story. See the movie and get the Special edition. I made the mistake of buying the single disc and not the 2 disc. I love Gothika!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0000039PW|5.0|1994 was the year we were introduced to the greatest mc of all time, The Notorious BIG, and he brought this classic with him. I remember when i first bought this cd i listened to it soo much and still do, that it has sooo many scratches on it. Every song on this cd is purely amazing . My fav tracks are Juicy and Suicidal Thoughts but every cut is classic!!
0671027387|4.0|I read this book after I read The Da Vince Code and before I read Angels and Demons... while it didn't stack up to the other two, it was certainly worth my time.  Deception Point was a great break from Tom Clancy and the like... the plot is a bit far-fetched, but that's ok, as it's fiction, and it's fun.  I'm tired of reading the reviews of all of the detail-cops out there... if you're going to read a fictional thriller, then you need to be prepared for a bit of literarly license.  What was great about this book, was that it tackled an area not usually covered with much success by fiction authors... NASA (and through it, subjects relating to space).  Usually a topic like this would be relegated to dollar store sci-fi, but Dan Brown does an excellent job of weaving Clancyesque political themes in with NASA coverups and suspenseful military operations.  When you pick this one up, make sure you are not expecting plots similar to Brown's two more famous tales.. this one's totally different.. but do not fear, it's certainly well worth the money, and you likely won't want to put it down!
B0000039QA|5.0|I currently and will prob always believe that Biggie Smalls, The Notorious BIG is the best mc to touch a microphone. I don't care what anyone says I think Biggie is the best. His raw lyrics, his wordplay and flow, his storytelling, his music, all out of this world unbelievable. Words can't express how classic this cd is. He has whatever your looking for on this cd, party jams, the slow jams, the serious joints, the dedications. All over phat beats comin from Primo and the Rza. Choice cuts: All of Them!!! Pick it up!
B000068TPN|5.0|Prepare to weep during the trials and tribulations of some of our country's bravest men... and prepare to get fired-up and motivated during the raging battle scenes that dominate this best-seller to blockbuster hit!  Mel Gibson brings a sense of dignity and overwhelming honor to his role as the Commanding Officer of one of the first American batallions to enter battle in Vietnam.  I'm not ashamed to say that I saw this SEVERAL times in the theater, as I couldn't get enough, and picked up new stuff every time I saw it.  The DVD is also great and is, without a doubt, well worth your money.  Buy this, and prepare to move it to the top of your DVD collection!
B0000041BX|5.0|The Quartetto Italiano (Le Quartet Italien) have produced a bunch of excellent albums through the years, but among others this one stands out as a crucial release. This is one of the most celebrated recordings of Schubert's late quartets and for some good reasons. Here they introduce one of the finest 'Death and the Maiden' on disc. Although the competition is huge, it remains a refined and enlivened performance that has special merits. Of course, vintage versions by the Busch Quartet and also by the Juilliard String Quartet are steady references the Quartetto will be forgiven for not completely achieving. The Busch Quartet, especially, is still unsurpassed in this domain. The Quartetto's dazzling Quartet in G is equally splendid, as does the Quartettsatz. The music has guts with no compromise on harmonic detail and elegance. The overall clarity of sound and delineation of instruments are striking. Comparatively, the Brandis Quartet -with a particularly excellent 'Rosamunde'- suffers a bit from a slightly harsh top end (violin) that contrasts with the warmer and more disciplined string tone present on the Quartetto Italiano's recording. The Brandis is, sonics aside, a very good set of the quartets even so it can't match the Quartetto in most areas (except, perhaps, for the shimmering 'Rosamunde'). There are plenty of superb recordings of those works, especially the 'Maiden', including (among the names to watch): The Auryn Quartet, Verdi Quartet, Amadeus Quartet, Budapest Quartet, Melos Quartet, Leipzig String Quartet, Alban Berg Quartet, Aria Quartet, Petersen Quartet, Guarneri String Quartet, as well as the famous Emerson Quartet. You can't go wrong with any of them. The Quartetto Italiano belongs to this category, and sometimes it can and effectively does even surpass one or another in a few minor areas. A great package, imbued with a nice touch of quality a la Philips Classics.
B000002UAX|5.0|Their record producer - George Martin - felt and continues to say to this day that the Beatles should have culled the best dozen songs on this double LP and issued one great album.<br /><br /> I disagree.<br /><br /> John Lennon publicly stated that recording Sgt Pepper's was the happiest and perhaps most creative time he enjoyed during his \\"career\\" with the Beatles. Some have speculated that Sgt Pepper's was so good - so earth shatteringly good..! - and so important that they had nowhere to go but down after that.<br /><br />For 99.9% of the musicians / song writers / composers on the planet, I would be inclined to agree with this. But in this instance, we're talking about the Beatles. And the normal rules re creativity simply didn't apply to these guys.<br /><br />The White Album shows some of the cracks that would later result in the breakup of the band. If Sgt Pepper was the incredible result of four guys working as the world's greatest band, the White Album felt like four guys working individually.<br /><br />But notwithstanding the above, this is still a great album where many of the songs took their genesis during the Beatles stay in India. And there's some wonderful anecdotal stories that come to life re many of the great songs on this LP which make the songs even more \\"listenable\\".<br /><br />MIke Love of the Beach Boys, for example, was staying at the same compound at Rishikesh, India listening to the Maharishi. Do you think maybe \\"Back In The USSR\\" might have evolved from a conversation /influence that Mike and Paul might have had..?<br /><br /> \\"Sexy Sadie\\" is another one of those wonderful songs that only John Lennon can write so well. This song is directly solely at the Maharashi, who is \\"Sexy Sadie\\" who happened to \\"make a fool of everyone\\".<br /><br /> \\"The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill\\" concerned a wealthy, young Ivy league type guy who happened to be there with his mother. Here's this idiot supposedly studying TM in this idyllic setting and when he has a couple of spare hours, he's out tiger hunting. And the story goes that while the other three Beatles were polite to this fellow when they would bump into him, John never masked his dislike of this fellow who got off killing tigers.<br /><br /> \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" provides another great story. During one particularly difficult time, George decided to invite his friend, Eric Clapton, into the studio to play on this new and great Harrison composition. Of course, Clapton initially protested saying \\"that nobody but the Beatles plays on Beatles albums - it just wasn't done\\". Well, Harrison convinced Eric that it was OK and while he was in the studio for hour after hour, all of the Beatles were on their very best behaviour, not wanting to \\"air their dirty laundry\\" to others.<br /><br /> Julia, Yer Blues. Revolution, Happiness Is A Warm Gun, Glass Onion are all great songs as well and certainly worthy of inclusion on any Beatles album.<br /><br /> When they do write individually, it's very interesting to see just how different Paul and John are in terms of their creative results.<br /><br /> Personally, I would be embarressed to have my name associated with something like Ob La Di Ob La Da, which is something only Paul Mc Cartney could have written. I Will and Martha My Dear are nice songs with very nice melodies.<br /><br /> Conversely, Happiness Is A Warm Gun, which was inspired by a magazine article that John read could only have originated in the mind of John Lennon. This and Revolution, for example, could never have been written by Paul.<br /><br /> When this album was originally released, it was indeed a very rare treat to receive two albums by the Beatles at that time. And notwithstanding a couple of weak effots that I usually just skip i.e. Why Don't We Do It In The Road, this album still provides a snapshot of the world's most important and creative band doing what they do best..

B000008M54|5.0|It is no small wonder that a song as raw and charming as this album's brilliant title track was recorded in the 80s, a decade of such excess and tasteless production as to have permanently altered the landscape of the music industry. Yet, for all the sideshows that passed for &quot;music&quot; throughout those years of awful haircuts and clown makeup, this album sounds conspicuously like the real thing: a festival of acoustic guitars, accordions, organs, fiddles and slide-mandolins lifted to the heavens on the glories of Mike Scott's unmistakable vocals. No one can say &quot;whooo-hooo!&quot; with as much conviction as that man, hooting, hollering and scraping his way through the beautifully bombastic &quot;We Will Not Be Lovers&quot; and the piano-hysterical &quot;World Party.&quot; Opening as it does with four consecutive masterpieces, this album joins another Irish triumph, U2's &quot;The Joshua Tree,&quot; as one of the most perfectly sequenced albums in rock history -- up there with Dylan's &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot; or Lou Reed's &quot;New York.&quot; Though the album's momentum slows gradually with the progessively bland &quot;Sweet Thing&quot; and &quot;Has Anybody Here Seen Hank,&quot; it never loses sight of its muse. Tunes like &quot;The Stolen Child&quot; or &quot;Strange Boat,&quot; while hardly the album's most interesting compositions, still command a clarity and urgency almost unheard of throughout the decade from which they so improbably emerged. &quot;Fisherman's Blues&quot; is that rare thing: an album that smacks of as much relevance and power today as it did the day it was released.
B000002UAU|5.0|I honestly don't know if Sgt Pepper's Lonely Heartls Club Band is the BEST album ever recorded. When you listen to the White Album or Revolver or Abbey Road, for example, they're all masterpieces that stand head and shoulders above anything else anybody else has ever done and you could make a compelling argument why one of these albums should hold this title.<br /><br /> But I will throw this out for your consideration. Sgt Pepper is the MOST important album ever made.<br /><br /> I was in my late teens in the summer of 1967 when this album was released and nobody had ever heard anything like it at the time. I recall travelling around the USA on my motorcyle that summer and it didn't matter where you were - a small town in Kansas, mid town Manhattan, Haight Ashbury - you would constantly hear the sounds of Sgt Pepper in the air. I remember reading comments by great recording artists who were also incredibly good and popular at the time thinking &quot;how on earth are we going to come up with something that can even hold a candle to this&quot;.<br /><br /> It was that good..!!<br /><br /> But it shouldn't have taken anybody by surprise.<br /><br /> You could see this tour-de-force coming after the release of the Beatles previous two gems - Rubber Soul and Revolver. And if there was any doubt as to the seemingly limitless creative abilities of these four guys, Penny Lane and the remarkable John Lennon postcard &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;, which were released just prior to Sgt Peppers, put any doubts to rest.<br /><br /> Even now, it blows my mind to think that in just three to four years, these guys went from composing and singing songs about &quot;I Want To Hold Your Hand&quot; and &quot;She Loves You&quot; to A Day In The Life, which may be the very best rock song ever composed. Period and end of argument. There just seemed to be no limits to The Beatles.<br /><br /> Sgt Peppper becomes an even more interesting album when you start to read and hear some of the anecdotal tidbits associated with it.<br /><br /> For eample, the Beatles made a video on the outskirts of a small English town to promote Strawberry Fields. During their stay, John Lennon was browsing through an old antiques store and happened to purchase an old Victorian poster that was all about a circus complete with a &quot;dancing horse&quot; and Pablo Fanque, etc. Of course, this poster became the wonderful &quot;For the Benefit of Mr Kite&quot;.<br /><br /> John was also an addicted TV watcher and minutes after seeing a televison commercial about Kelloggs Corn Flakes composed &quot;Good Morning, Good Morning&quot;.<br /><br /> But the tour de force on this album is the brilliant A Day In The Life. John was also an avid reader who would buy all of the London newspapers and read them from cover to cover. In one paper, he happened to read stories about the Guiness heir who died in an automobile accident (&quot;he blew his mind out in a car&quot;), alot of pot holes in the roads in one northern English town (&quot;4,000 holes in Blackburn, Lancashire&quot;), etc.<br /><br /> The problem was he wrote a beginning and end. But no middle. Concurrently, Paul had the makings of a middle eight section (&quot;woke up/ got out of bed / dragged a comb across my head&quot;) and nothing else. At a time when Lennon / McCartney collaberations were rarely, if ever, collaberations anymore (they continued to give joint credit, however, songs that were sung by Paul were Paul's songs and songs that John sang were songs that he wrote). However, in this instance, they were able to merge their &quot;songs&quot; to produce this masterpiece which, in my opinion, is the best song ever and for this reason alone may entitle Sgt Pepper to lay claim to the best rock album ever.<br /><br /> One thing I've never bought into concerns Paul's idea that this was a &quot;concept album&quot;. In other words, the Beatles would &quot;transform&quot; themselves into another band, which would makethis album. Aside from the title song and the reprise just prior to a Day In The Life, every other song is a &quot;stand alone&quot; song that could just as easily have appeared on any other Beatles album.<br /><br /> But this in no way detracts from this incredible album.<br /><br /> Simply put, this album changed the way rock musicians saw themselves and the way music was made thereafter.<br /><br /> This is the most important album ever made by four guys who merely changed the world.s into another band, which would make this album.

B00006M183|4.0|After the aimlessness and indifference of &quot;Binaural,&quot; the band's lowest moment, PJ returns to the tighter structures and patience that made &quot;Yield&quot; one of their most engaging albums. Riot Act also boasts something of a newer direction for the band, and it is thus no surprise that critics are beginning to reevaluate Pearl Jam outside of the &quot;grunge&quot; mantle under which they were ushered so hastily. Only 1996's &quot;No Code&quot; starts off on a quieter note than Riot Act's haunting and eloquent &quot;Can't Keep&quot; which, ironically, is every bit as powerful a launching pad as more raucous openers such as &quot;Go&quot; or &quot;Brain of J.&quot; Much like &quot;No Code,&quot; Riot Act is full of a kind of intrigue and risk that Pearl Jam displays only ocassionally. The gritty groove of &quot;You Are&quot; has the sound of a great hip-hop beat overlaid with some good old snotty rock 'n roll. Though Vedder's lyrics frequently leave a lot to be desired here (&quot;Love is a tower/And you're the Key&quot; or &quot;First comes love, then comes pain/Let the games begin&quot;) Riot Act's searing musical dexterity ultimately wins out. The rollicking &quot;Green Disease&quot; sounds like the first track of the next Strokes album, while the gorgeous &quot;Thumbing My Way&quot; nearly steals the show with its tender plainspokenness. The guitar-roasting tandem of Gossard and Mcreedy is as loose as ever on the glorious &quot;1/2 Full&quot; and its wailing solos. Yet the album's most captivating moment comes with the band's greatest departure from its sound, as Vedder bellows commandingly through the brief &quot;Arc,&quot; a revisitation of his interest in middle-eastern sounds that ushers in the ambient and dark closer, &quot;All or None.&quot; These songs run laps around just about anything Binaural served up. But as even that subpar effort delivered a few gems in &quot;Of the Girl,&quot; &quot;Nothing as it Seems&quot; and &quot;Breakerfall,&quot; Riot Act is more proof that this is one of the few bands that fans can count on to deliver at least a handful of classics on every release. Whether they take time to grow on you or grab you by the throat upon the first listen, the result is usually the same: a wild gratitude.t; Riot Act is more proof that this is one of the few bands that fans can count on to deliver at least a handful of classics on every release.

Gavin DeGraw's Charot Stripped uses back to the root bacis to infuse our souls and open our minds. Lyrical magic. Talent and great songwriting are hard to find but with Chariot Stripped you get just that. A must have for anyone who is tried of the pressed out sound of music that is on the air today. Finally something worth waiting for.
B00005JKCH|5.0|The effects on this movie is super!  You will think spidie is swinging his way around!  Doing superheroes on the movies can work, but it takes treading a fine line.  You need to remember the comic book roots, that OTT larger than life story, but keep it somewhat believable or it can be too cartoonish.  The recent rash of comics hitting the screen have been rather enjoyable.  But Spiderman surprised me how watchable it is.  With quality acting, super FX work, it should please the whole family.<br /><br />William Defoe is perfect as the Green Goblin, showing the caliber of the production.
B00000K0DV|5.0|This is a brutal film that deserves more respect!  <br />FULCI LIVES!!!
B000060P79|2.0|When Simple Plan first came out, I was just starting to get into punk and rock music, so I thought they were pretty good. I saw them in concert (they're awesome live), and I bought their CD. Then I started getting into bands like Green Day and Blink-182 and realized that Simple Plan isn't much compared to them. <br />  <br /> Now, I'm not going to be like some of you reviewers who have nothing better to do than to go on Amazon.com and bash bands that you think are &quot;posers&quot;; I'm just going to state my opinion. Some of the songs on Simple Plan's CD are pretty good, like &quot;I'll Meet You There&quot; and &quot;Perfect&quot;, but honestly, there's only so much I can stand. I don't really like the vocals--they're a little bit whiny for me, and remind me of New Found Glory (which I also used to like, but don't much anymore). <br />  <br /> The thing is, my opinions have changed and my favorite bands have changed. I used to like Simple Plan; now they're not that good to me. If Simple Plan is your thing, listen to them. If they're not, then don't listen to them. Don't go around putting them down because they're not what you're into. And don't call me a poser just because I used to like Simple Plan, and now I don't. Peoples' tastes change. <br />  <br /> And like Nikki Navaille from Orlando, FL said, if you want to spend all your time talking about how much you hate Simple Plan, make an anti-Simple Plan site. <br />  <br /> All I've got left to say is: This CD is good for those of you that like pop-punk music like Good Charlotte or New Found Glory. If you don't like them, then you probably won't like Simple Plan.
B000002KIE|2.0|This band which i do not hate i just do not like to say there name because when i always look up really good 70's rock and roll some how i always get on to this bands biiography. I have heard it all and their songs what i have come to conclude is that they are the most overatted band ever. they made one cd and changed the world. Their music was not even original everyone that does their history knows that this band just wanted to be the heartbreakers. malcom their manger repeatedly asked Johnny htunders to make a band called the sex pistols but he turned him down. The pistols lived on shock value and a little bit of substance that is why they get three stars. The pistols would just do what it took to shock you so they would get a little press coverage and you would hear about them. A perfect example is glen matlock being kicked out of the band for not wanting to do the stupid stunts.(Glen was the only one with talent). THe worst part about this cd is it sets up punk rock to just be some stupid music where your anti everything and hate the goverment when the best bands make real songs instead off political songs. The pistols had nothing in the middle and they where just a image. THat millions of teenagers still today by to display that they are &quot;punk rock&quot; and fit in with their freinds. Still today bands do the same thing with punk rock like anti-flag this shock crap to sell records to preteens just wanting to be cool. This cd does have its good melody, but if you just think punk rock is a shock thing buy this record,but if you want some good old fashion rock n' roll just sped up(punk rock) i would highly recomend you stear clear of this black whole title. Instead go look on Amazon for the band that brings substance to punk that makes it something magical that you can feel in your veins. The cd you will never see on the top 100 best albums or 500 best, but is better then the clash and the pistols. look up L.A.M.F(cd title) THE HEARTBREAKERS(the band). Everytime i listen to this album i wonder why no one talks about these guys and none of the stupid punk gets at my school know about them. This is the altime best gem of a cd ever do yourself a favor. Forget about this pistol crap and actually look for substance in your music.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|Experience Hendrix: The Best Of Jimi Hendrix is a greatest hit's complination that spans from 1967 recordings, to his final recordings in 1970. This is a great greatest hits album for any new listener to Hendrix's music. I already have all of Hendrix's albums so this one was aside the rest. This is truely a great album that includes Purple Haze, All Along The Watchtower, Freedom, Manic Depression, Angel, Spanish Castle Magic, and many more. I would Recomened this one to anybody that is starting to listen to Jimi Hendrix. Enjoy!
B00008RV1L|4.0|This is a real strange film, well done, with a lot of zest and a great performance by Christian Bale.  I haven't seen too many of these humorous and cleverly done films made in the last decade.
B000002P5W|5.0|Axis: Bold As Love, Hendrix's second studio album was recorded shortly after Are You Experienced. Most bands cant compare to a second follow up album after their first big hit, Hendrix could. This album is very good that contains more work musically wise. On Are You Experienced everything was more rawer..... the guitar is beautiful on this one, expesically on Little Wing a highlight from this album. Another great song is Spanish Castle Magic. This is a great hit for the press, and for the fans. Highly Recomended!

1592400876|4.0|Eats, Shoots, & Leaves was, despite not learning anything new, admittedly enjoyable and somewhat humorous.  Truss invokes an abundance of wry English humor throughout the book, which is, by the way, written in a quasi-novel form.<br /><br />One annoying tidbit that Truss incessantly referenced was the movie title that grated on her nerves to no end: Two Weeks Notice.  Evidently, the improper punctuation of the movie's title was just as dreadfully painful as the movie itself.<br /><br />Overall, the book proves to be a quick, fun, and educational read -- although perhaps not as all-encompassing as I might have hoped for.
B00007LTIB|5.0|\\"Relayer\\" along with \\"Tales From Topographic Oceans\\", \\"Fragile\\" and \\"Close To The Edge\\" is the best of the 1970s Yes and my perhaps my favorite Yes album. Theres some truly amazing playing by everybody involved on this one. Patrick Moraz's keyboards are refreshingly different, more jazzy and really blend in well with the band. What a shame that they kicked him out after this one album. Steve Howe plays with a savagery and abandon I've never heard him play with before or since, he's remarkable. Fantastic drumming by Alan White. I think Alan came into his own on this release. Chris Squire's bass playing is wonderfullly nimble, almost jazzy, yet still retains a lot of rock muscle.  Jon Anderson's vocals are impeccable, and the lyrics which actually make sense are at times quite moving.<br /><br /> The album starts with \\"The Gates Of Delerium\\" a song that depicts musically the start, middle and end of a battle. The middle section is the most violent Yes I've ever heard as they imitate the clash of swords and the chaos of war. The final part of Gates of Delerium, the sad aftermath of the battle is breathtaking in its emotional impact. I can't praise Moraz keyboards enough. He blends perfectly with the other guys and adds considerable atmosphere. The next song \\"Sound Chaser\\" is aptly named. Its an insane, mostly instrumental workout that sounds like \\"Close To The Edge\\" meets Mahavishnu Orchestra. Its a savage, though jazz-like rock masterpiece with some truly spastic guitar and drums. In the middle of the piece is a solo distorted electric guitar interlude that is a melding of classical with rock electricity. That's followed by some almost funky, yet sizzlingly fast jazz rock keyboard pyrotechnics by Pat Moraz. This song has odd changes of meter and tempo, wicked solos, some tribal chanting and just cooks. The last song \\"To Be Over\\" is quite simply one of the most beautiful things Yes has ever done. Its delicate yet strong and is a welcome respite after the assault of the previous two songs. There is some fine guitar from Steve Howe and wonderfully subtle keyboards from Patrick Moraz. The song builds to a slow glorious vocal melody. Some very nice keys and guitar ensue and the song ends with two different repeating melodys played on guitar and sung that gradually fade out like a majestic sunset changing to purple night.<br /><br /> Relayer is one of best and most unique albums in Yes' discography. Due in large part to Patrick Moraz' keyboards, it contains some of Yes most spirited almost violent playing. If you like \\"Close to the Edge\\" or \\"Tales From Topographic Oceans\\" you will most probably like this album.us two songs.

B0001NBMBC|5.0|I cannot understand why some people have been rating this album so badly. Yes, it is softer than their other albums - but so what? They decided to create a more intelligent style of album instead. Don't get me wrong; I have liked Slipknot when they were first released and at the time, with the group of people I associated with - I was selling out. I was listening to the likes of Death Metal such as Deicide and an array of Black Metal such as Mayhem. However, I did not choose my music based on the heaviest or the worst lyrics but rather the feelings it conveyed. In my opinion Slipknot have got better at doing this with each release, Vol3 being phenomenal. I highly recommend giving this album a chance. If you are looking for the heaviest albums then I suggest another band. Otherwise pick this up and buy it! Also, if you havn't heard it yet - look out for Dimmu Borgir....
B00009Z574|4.0|I don't understand why this album is so hated. No, its not a classic album but its close to being as good as their previous effort &quot;Going For The One.&quot; Theres a wealth of great playing on this album. There are complex, moving melodies, rocking guitar, bass and drums and the keyboards are in general well played throughout.<br /><br /> I always thought that on Tormato Yes tried to shift gears. They eschewed their trademark side long sonic excursions and like much of &quot;Going For The One&quot; wrote shorter, yet still progressive songs. And for the most part they succeeded: &quot;Future Times/Rejoice&quot;, &quot;Don't Kill The Whale&quot;, &quot;Release Release&quot;, and &quot;On the Silent Wings Of Freedom&quot; are all very good concise yet complex progressive rock songs. &quot;Madrigal&quot; and &quot;Onward&quot; are both very nice ballads with a good sense of relaxed mood or spacey atmosphere. &quot;Circus of Heaven&quot; isnt so hot, but isn't as wretched as some of the reviewers would have you believe. It's perhaps a bit too precious for my taste.<br /><br /> However, criticisms about the odd sound quality are for the most part valid. While the album is clear, its got a tinny, trebly sort of sheen to it. There's not much bottom end at all and the keyboard sounds that Wakeman uses are sometimes strange, as is the sound of Steve Howe's guitar. Quite simply put this album is sonically very different from Yes' previous output and perhaps this is why so many people seem to dislike it so much.<br /><br /> Overall though, I think Tormato is a good album. No, its not one of my favorite Yes albums. In terms of quality its in the middle of the pack. But it is perhaps one of the last truly progressive albums that Yes put out before becomming more pop oriented in the eighties. Its a transitional album, but has its own charms and is definitely worth having.
B00005N83M|4.0|I'm not a fan of J.Lo's &quot;singing&quot; but you have to admit she has some good beats, and talented producers on this album. I think she sounds better in spanish then english. You should buy this album if you're looking for some fun music. My favorite songs are &quot;Dame&quot; con Chayanne (i love him he has a beautiful voice as well as gorgeous) and &quot;Si ya se acabo&quot; I think most of us has been a relationship where its ending and dont know why. Buy this album its very good.

The hallucinations and the otherness of the human being (Van Gogh , Goya , Faulkner , Rimbaud , Shakespeare , Proust) are present in this intelligent puzzle recreated with credibility and depicted with surrealistic moods . This adaptation of Stephen King novel has only a little default . It reminds us too much to The shinning . There are very common places ; the isolated writer , the loneliness , the creativity absence , the letters on the Lap top and the pages in the typewriter , the similar resources from the outerworld to our disturbed writer . That sin makes the film became very predictable .<br />  It just to recognize the amazing role given for John Turturro (The Luzin Defense) .

B000002V0Q|5.0|As many people will know Dave Mustaine could have been in Metallica. He was hanging around with the band in the early days and wrote &quot;Ride The Lightning&quot; with them. Now for someone to walk away from that is either very brave or very stupid. Mustaine has proved to be the former. This man has guts! He also writes some of the best kickass rock music you have ever heard. If you like sissy bands like Journey and REO Speedwagon do not buy this album. Highlights on Countdown...? There are many - the intro riff to &quot;Sweating Bullets&quot; will grab you like a giant claw and ensure you listen - or else...The intro to &quot;Foreclosure of a Dream&quot; also is awesome, very spooky and is the sort of thing, if you are a guitarist you will want to play again and again. The best track for me is probably &quot;Symphony of Destruction&quot;. Apart from &quot;Architecture of Aggression&quot; it is possibly the heaviest track and has a really simple but gutbusting riff and Mustaine's voice is just right for the music. He can sing but sometimes he kind of narrates the lyrics with his snarl. Very cool. &quot;High Speed Dirt&quot; would make a good bikers' anthem and &quot;This was my life&quot; is also another stonkin rocker. Mustaine and Marty share lead duties and there is no shred here. The solos are very balanced and in context. If you like heavy rock you must have this in your collection. This was the first Megadeth album I bought and I will certainly buy the rest now.
B000053V7O|5.0|This is an amazing movie. Great jazz, great story, great acting by Gordon. There are also so many great jazz musicians in this movie, not to mention the score written by Herbie Hancock. The guy above who is saying this is just a rip off of Bud Powell's life is a moron. If you look at the beginning of the movie it says this is based on true encounters or Powell and the movie is dedicated to him. So, YEAH...it's gonna seem like a familiar story...what an idiot. <br />Anyway, if you love jazz you'll love this. This is also a movie that you have to sit and watch interrupted or you'll miss some funny, inspiring, thoughful, beautiful moments.

My first impression, on opening the book, was that a gray mist had been sprayed on each page. Looking closer, I realized the gray stuff was the text. I will not subject myself to this sort of eye strain, and suggest you don't either. <br />  <br /> The previous edition was over 1,100 pages. The Amazon preview pages for this volume loaded so slowly I gave up trying to see them, and wasted my money on this illegible copy. Don't buy it, would be my recommendation. Try to find the earlier, green-covered book, with larger print and over twice as many pages.

B00005QEO2|4.0|\\"Young Lust - The Aerosmith Anthology\\" chronicles Aerosmith's Geffen-years from the mid-eighties onward.  Gathering 34 singles, album tracks and live cuts, it offers a fine retrospective, and it manages to include almost all of the best songs from Aerosmith's last six studio albums. This is pretty much all that the casual fan will need.    Having said that, I would have preferred a leaner version of \\"Amazing\\" to the orchestrated one included here, but the acoustic rendition of the hit \\"Livin' On The Edge\\" is really good, and Run-DMC's take on the sublime hard rock song \\"Walk This Way\\" is included, too.   The live versions of \\"Dream On\\" and \\"Sweet Emotion\\" are sort of pointless, though, and those two should have been left off in favour of two or three more songs from the band's Geffen years, but the selection is generally very good, and small flaws like those I just mentioned don't really ruin the overall impression.     The MTV-staples \\"Dude (looks like a lady)\\" and \\"Love In An Elevator\\" are here, as well as power ballads like \\"Angel\\", \\"Cryin'\\", and \\"Crazy\\", the underrated blues shuffle \\"Hangman Jury\\", the melodic (and disturbing) \\"Janie's Got A Gun\\", and several other smashes like \\"The Other Side\\", \\"What It Takes\\", and the hard rockers \\"Eat The Rich\\", \\"Head First\\", \\"Let The Music Do The Talking\\", \\"Rag Doll\\", and \\"My Fist Your Face\\".   \\"Young Lust\\" also includes and excellent version of the Door's \\"Love Me Two Times\\", as well as \\"Deuces Are Wild\\", \\"Blind Man\\" and \\"Walk On Water\\", the three previously unreleased songs from Aerosmith's earlier Geffen compilation, \\"Big Ones\\".     This well-annotated double disc compilation is the best available overview of Aerosmith's latter-day output. Get this one, and the excellent box set \\"Pandora's Box\\" for the 'Smith's seventies classics, and you're set!
B00008EYA5|5.0|This movie was great!  Its full of Action.  And there are a few funny parts to give it that extra touch...  Alot of people give it a bad review just because there was not sex!!  Now whats wrong with no sex in a movie!?  There is sex in like 7 out of 10 movies now days.  So this movies is actually a refreshing new movie.  I watched it with my friends and when it ended we wanted more...  This movie deserves a sequal...  If your into only movies with sex and romance then dont watch this and dont give it a bad review just because you dont like the Action Genre.  But if you love action movies this should be at the top of your list along with Bad Boys 2 and Man on Fire...
B000001EEN|5.0|This, to me, is one of the most curiously overlooked and underrated live albums of the 70s. Ever, actually.   I know that not everyone shares my fondness for Eric Clapton the bluesman-slash-rock singer rather than Eric Clapton the balladeer-slash-watered-down-blues-singer, but I remain convinced that this is one of the three or four greatest records Clapton has ever released.      \\"Eric Clapton's Rainbow Concert\\" is not a polished, highly produced affair; it is all gritty rock n' roll and smouldering blues, and Clapton is backed by star players like Pete Townshend, Ron Wood and Steve Winwood, and guest percussionist Rebop Kwaku Baah. And this all-star band, which has former Traffic-drummer Jim Capaldi on the swivel chair and the late Rick Gretch playing bass, leads Clapton through a dozen raw, ragged and superbly atmospheric renditions of his best songs of the 60s and 70s, including \\"Layla\\", \\"Bell Bottom Blues\\", \\"Key To The Highway\\" and \\"Blues Power\\".    Eric Clapton and the band play with passion and urgency, and Clapton himself sounds much more alive than on most live recordings.   If you like Eric Clapton at his grittiest, it doesn't get any better than this.

0553277472|1.0|This nonsense has to end now.      Like many of you, a wild-eyed friend recommended this book to me. I had heard so many good things, I was stunned at how awful it was.     The books ends with him sitting cross-legged and naked on the floor, catatonic, sitting in his own urine, with a cigarette burning down to his knuckles. His wife (wisely) calls the authorities to take him away and receive electroshock treatment. His son asks, \\"Were you insane?\\" He cries out, \\"No!\\" To his son, and to us.    The entire book is an attempt to say that rather than being mentally ill, he is simply a free-thinker, and sees the world differently.     Many, many readers pointed out how rambling the narrative is, and how illogical his reasoning is (and this from the ones who liked the book!) Other symptoms of his illness: anyone who disagreed with him had a secret motive, or they couldn't see the \\"truth.\\"    He's absolutely furious at being forced to endure shock treatments and outraged at being labeled \\"insane,\\" but he was (at one time) severely mentally ill, and trying to deal with that. That's HIS journey. Yours is not to get caught up in the \\"depth\\" of this book as if it means anything. It doesn't.   Do NOT follow a madman, do NOT support his illness by buying or recommending this book, and please, please, take a moment to feel sorry for his traumatized son.

0790729644|5.0|The movie &quot;Unforgiven&quot; is a good movie verging on greatness. It is a depressing movie and is very dark, brooding kind of movie. The acting is top notch. Gene Hackman is excellent as the sheriff. Morgan Freeman and Clint Eastwood are also good. The cinematography is excellent. This is a movie to have in your DVD library. It is worth several viewings over a lifetime as is &quot;The Good, The Bad and The Ugly&quot; with Clint Eastwood.  <br /> However, I must admit that I have encountered friends/family that don't like this movie. However, it is usually that they don't care much for westerns and prefer other types of movies like romance movies. I have found that some women don't care for this movie and don't like it. This film is more of a film for men. The film is violent, but I didn't find it too graphic so I think it is okay for teenagers 13 and up. Most kids younger might find it boring. If you have never seen this movie, give it a viewing. It is worth your time and effort.
B00023BLXK|3.0|There are lots of things in Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights that I just did not like. The story was utterly predictable and dry. The characters weren't fleshed out enough. The songs were modern when the film took place in the 50s. It was too short and ended very quickly. And the dancing wasn't dirty. That said, there was also alot that attracted me to the film. The cast was great and the setting was beautiful. While the story was boring, it had charm. After the movie, I viewed the deleted scenes and realized that had they not been taken out, most of my complaints wouldn't exist. I hate when a movie is ruined because of test audience opinions. The deleted scenes in this case should have stayed because they added to the story rather than subtracted from it. Had that been the case, we would have had a much better movie. But I guess Havana Nights was good enough. It was 85 minutes of entertainment, nothing more. But it sure was fun.
B000002G23|5.0|The Police are my favorite band of all time, and this is the collection that you'd want if you want everything by them. It includes all 5 studio albums over the span of 4 discs. You get all the hit singles, fun listening tracks, obsucre compositions, instrumentals, B-sides and more. I cannot emphasize the extreme mass of great music on these 4 CDs. However, I will mention that there are 2 versions of &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot;, the studio version and a live one. Both tracks are amazing. <br />  <br /> This set really shows the growth of the band (though they never completely strayed from their roots.) Their great riffs and complex chords (Sting loves his 9th Chords), combined with amazing lyrics and energetic execution will always be remembered in high regard. <br />  <br /> It even comes with a booklet insert. It actually explains the band's history better than VH1's behind the music. <br />  <br /> Buy this set, it's worth the money.
0800103661|5.0|One need not be a science fiction fan to appreciate this life affirming film.  Aside from the awe-inspiring cinemetography and the eerily realistic storyline, replete with sociological and medical ethics themes, I loved its message of hope - about the possibility of a person overcoming one's (government) imposed &#34;shortcomings&#34;; and not allowing anyone to define one's destiny.<br /><br />I buy copies of this movie whenever I can (I have since purchased a copy in every format for myself) and gift it to all of my loved ones, friends and teachers I admire.  Please see this film.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|This is music and an artist you wont find just anywhere. Gavin DeGraw's album Chariot and Chariot Stripped changed my life. He can sing a song and make you believe every word of it. This has everything you could want in music. Good words, good vocals, good music. Very close to perfect. Trust me Gavin DeGraw is a legend in the making. My favorite on this album is Change is Gonna Come. He does a tremendous encore of the original by Sam Cooke. When I first heard this, I was in the car and almost wrecked because my whole body just went in chills. If you want good music, this is where its at.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|Chariot (stripped) is definitly here to impress. It has stripped-acoustic versions of the original 11 songs from his first album and also a bonus cover of &quot;A change is gonna come&quot; by Sam cooke that was amazingly redone. This album is definitly soulful, live, and honest. It portrays the emotion and energy that he is able to give to his audience.Besides the added bonus of the original CD it is suitable for anyone who enjoys great music, full of energy and heart Chariot (stripped) will not dissapoint.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|This talented young singer/songwriter, will go places. I highly recomend this cd, it shows the raw talent of this young man. I wouldn't be surprised if he won a grammy. This is an excellent cd, and i hope everyone buys it. Two thumbs up!!( and if i had more, it would most definintely be more!)
B00028HBKM|1.0|If Jesus were alive today, he would boycott this proposterous assertion of his final moments.  As any good, devout, patriotic christian knows from reading the sacred dead sea scrolls, Jesus lived to be an old man with many children and his beloved Queen Mary magdaline.  Mel Gibson, or Mad Gibson, has clearly visited his cocaine dealer one too many times lately to dream up this convoluted, blood-bath of Caligula-styled paranoia in an extreme attempt to banish everyone elese's money into to his wallet.  By the way, people who have been whipped this many times generally don't still have skin on their backs.  A much more accurate portrayal of Jesus and God in the lives of people in modern times would be the powerfully moving The Order.  With crisp direction and cardinal slurring, it is sure to keep the congregation gasping.
0312335164|2.0|While I'm a huge fan of Angels and Demons as well as the Da Vinci Code, I found Digital Fortress to be Dan Brown's worst book. Not only is it hard to believe, but his description of Spain and Seville were horribly inaccurate. Having lived there, I know firsthand that Spain is a very modern and well-off country, definitly not a 3rd world nation and not at all like it is described in this book. Also, the computer descriptions are pretty tedious to read and outdated. Skip this one, but his other books are fantastic
B0002EXH4K|5.0|This version rocks way more than the original. The guitars and bass are upfront and the overall sound is great. This album is perfectly executed and Marty's solos are just awesome. The demos that also come with this version makes it a perfect purchase. More bands should put demos with their CDs as an incentive for us the fans.
B000002BFZ|5.0|I absolutely hated this CD when it first came out.  I listened to it once and put it away. Two years later, when I was finally going to see Pearl Jam in concert, I dug it out so I could familiarize myself with it. I was completely blown away.  This CD was amazing!  Every song on there is perfect.  Even 8 years after this came out, it is still relevant to my life today.  This is a CD that grows better every time you play it.  This is by far their best work in my opinion.  It truly stands the test of time.
B00003CXCD|5.0|A honey-sweet innocent Princess couldn't wait to sample an ordinary lifestyle, ran away, and hit on to a journalist for an exciting and romantic day. Time's up but they fell in love......          This is a very charming story. Audrey Hepburn not only earned her Oscar Best Actress award from this, but also her new haircut in the film became the well-known 'Audrey Style' in 50s and 60s. The DVD picture quality is very good, sound is beautiful, and extra features are sufficient. Compare to Hepburn's another best known 'Breakfast at Tiffany', this one seems missing a happy ending, but what could they do: you're the Princess but I'm a journalist, do we have future together or should it be a cherishable memory deep in our heart forever...... Overall, it's still a FIVE STARS rating. Excellent film.      *** Otto Yuen's DVD Special Rating for Roman Holiday ***  1. Film Rewatchability: VERY HIGH  2. DVD Featurability: MEDIUM  3. Picture Quality: VERY GOOD  4. Sound Quality: VERY GOOD       (Reviewed by Otto Yuen, 31-Jul-2004)
B00005A0V0|1.0|I bought this because my current copy of the CD has a loud click and missing audio exactly 40 seconds into Nine Feet Underground. <br /> Imagine my surprise when I discovered that this &quot;REMASTERED&quot; version with bonus tracks has exactly the same problem. <br /> This is no improvement over the previous DERAM release, and I recommend looking for a copy from a different label. <br />
B00020HEG6|5.0|Simply put,  Williams best score in while; moody, evocative and humorous in just the right mix.  Now don't misunderstand me, I like John Williams, with the exception of the Star Wars scores, I get nearly every CD released by him, but over the years I've been finding his work repetative (as a composer, if you can't borrow from yourself, who can you?)  This score was a wonderful surprise, it seemed really fresh and inspired.  Along with the new director to the series, there seems to have been a new life injected into Williams' sense of drama and playfulness; I can't get enough.  I like the use of the period instruments as a counterpoint to the modern orchestra as well. <br />Can't wait for the next installment.
B000286S8S|5.0|When Sammy left the group, the band had just completed the Balance tour and a few songs for &quot;Twister.&quot; The path they were moving was deep guitar chords, combined with heavy drums and solid vocals. The new songs on this album reflect that movement.  <br />  <br /> &quot;It's About Time&quot; is a good song for what it's worth: a message directly to the fans.  <br />  <br /> &quot;Up For Breakfast&quot; has some silly lyrics, but that's what's fun about rock songs. The music is great.  <br />  <br /> &quot;Learning To See&quot; is my personal favorite. It combines dark, almost eerie chords with a message of how people think they have everything figured out, but some event shows they do not. It may have personal meaning with Eddie and Val's break-up, or the band's (my guess is Eddie and Val). <br />  <br /> The &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; aspect is excellent. Only a few songs would I trade off (&quot;Dancing in the Street&quot; being one). Otherwise, this is AMAZING for the casual VH listener. A great buy!
B0002EXH5O|5.0|This version rocks big time. Finally you can hear everything clear and with presence. The guitars don't sound thin and have way more body. It's just awesome and I recommend getting all the remastered versions as I already have.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|Gavin DeGraw is one of those artists you need to see live to really appreciate. The man can put on a show that will knock your socks off. His album &quot;Chariot&quot; is a main source of material for these live shows, as well as any number of incredible soul-filled covers.       On &quot;Chariot Stripped&quot;, DeGraw heads back into the studio to re-record the album that put him on the map, but gives each song a &quot;live&quot; feel by taking a bare-bones approach to each song. The result is an album that leaves the listener with a sense of having actually just seen the artist live.       With so many bands intent on releasing live albums of their best material, it's refreshing to see one take those same songs and record them with the sound clarity that only a studio can provide. DeGraw's voice has such a distinct, gritty sound that each track gets taken to a level that might normally get lost in the clean-up production phase of an album.       With the new spin on these tracks you get the rawest, most emotional forms of already great songs that have been further tweaked and perfected on the road.       As an added bonus, the album includes an amazing cover of &quot;Change is Gonna Come&quot; by Sam Cooke that will leave you speechless. Degraw has gained a reputation for delivering some of the most inspired covers of Motown classics to come along in years, and this track proves why. He belts out the lyrics as if he wrote them himself and pulls the listener through the roller coaster of his vocal range along the way.       All in all, this is a great deal for a two-cd set and it just gets better with each listen. Tell all your friends to watch out for this artist, because he's gaining momentum as his popularity grows and has the potential to be a household name.
B00004Y2FT|4.0|Though this would not be the exact list that I would have put together... I still like this cd because it has made me appreciate some tracks that I use to just gloss over--like, Fifty-Fifty Clown and Orange Appled. However, I feel that 4AD could have added more to the selection (too many to list for me as examples.). And why not include the non-4AD songs as well. They've released as equally strong music post the 4AD days. Liz and company can do no wrong. They should have never broken up!!! Oh yeah, the art work for this is album is also quite good. Vaughn Oliver rules!!!
B00006AFUR|5.0|This album is insane! I admit I was sceptical at first when my brother told me the band was fronted by Jared Leto, but once he skipped his DVD of The Core to the end and I heard Echelon I was hooked. The album seems to take you somewhere else, almost to another universe with futuristic, story-like lyrics and great sounding mix of guitars, drums, and synthesised sounds. Leto has one of those rare voices that sounds great whether he's crooning, singing, snarling or yelling. The only song I'm not really a fan of is Buddha for Mary, but the quality of the album is such that I still rate it 3 1/2 stars....and it's my least favourite song! Buy this album if you like rock music
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Girl, I'm sorry, but you really are trailer park trash. You're a talentless, compulsive lying, 55-hour marrying, wild partying Jezebel who likes to steal married men from pregnant Black women. Plus, you can't sing for rice and I'm glad Justin Timberlake dumped you. You ain't fooling me with this &quot;little-miss-innocent&quot; garbage. I'm not havin' it! I love Jessica Simpson and she will always be better than you!
B000060MY6|5.0|I loved this movie the first time I watched it, and I still love it after three viewings. Now, I understand the &quot;basic&quot; structure of the movie, but not all of the details. The movie is understandable and David Lynch has not made a movie that only David Lynch can understand. It was carefully constructed and absolutely requires repeated viewings to understand it (what could be better in a DVD than a movie that you have to watch over and over again to understand everything?). <br />  <br /> In any event, let me give a hint to anyone interested in understanding the movie. After the initial shot of a jitterbug competition, we see the main character of the movie. A minute later, we see someone falling asleep into red covers on a bed (don't see the person, but we see it from the person's point of view). The next two hours of the movie are a dream. <br />  <br /> After about two hours, the main character, Diane Selwyn, wakes up from her dream. You know this because she wakes up from the same red covers that she fell asleep on (in the first few minutes of the move). <br />  <br /> Diane has mental problems relating to her being spurned by her lesbian lover Camilla Rhodes (Camilla is in love with a man, but also seems to like the lesbian scene - just not with Diane anymore). So, Diane pays a hitman to have her killed, and supposedly, Camilla is killed. Diane is racked with guilt, mental problems and flashbacks of her time with Camilla. It is this mental breakdown and her hiring of a hitman, plus a scene where Camilla humilliates her at a party that make up the last thirty minutes of the film. <br />  <br /> There are many little details that I want to work out to completely understand the movie, but I definitely understand the most important parts. Here they are again. <br />  <br /> Main character is introduced at a jitterbug contest (real life, not fantasy). <br />  <br /> Main character falls asleep (dream -fantasy). <br />  <br /> Two hours of dream happen, andthe exact meaning of every detail cannot be completely explained, but many of the characters and situations make sense during the last half hour of the movie. <br />  <br /> Main character awakes (about 2 hours into the movie). This tells the real life story of Diane Selwyn and her hallucinations of Camilla. It also explains many of the characters in her dream, and her hiring of a hit man to kill Camilla.  <br />  <br /> I don't want to give a lot away, because I want people to view the movie many times to get an understanding of this movie. There are so many little and subtle details that will enhance this experience. <br />  <br /> It's a phenominal movie and it really does rate as one of the best ever. Believe me, it is not just a Lynchian thing that no one is meant to understand. There is a rhyme and reason to the movie, it just takes several viewings to understand. <br />  <br /> I will not put myself in a position of mentioning this movie with other great movies of the past (even though I think it is up there with the best movies of any age), but it is one of those movies that require, yes require, many viewings to get even a basic understanding of what is going on. <br />  <br /> Once again, the simplest synopsis of all. <br />  <br /> About 2 minutes into the movie the main character falls asleep. For the next two hours the main character has a dream. After that, the character awakes and we are given the details of how she arranged to have her lesbian lover killed. This is the most basic idea of what the movie is about. <br />  <br /> I have never experienced a movie as complex and understandable as this before. It is a classic and I guarantee that future viewers and reviewers will see it as such. Like I said before, it really is not a movie that is simply Lynchian and cannot be understood. I honestly don't think cinema gets better than this movie.  <br />  <br /> I don't suspect anyone will ever read this article, as it is somewhere around the 917th reviewof the movie, but hopefully, someone will find it useful.
B00006RINF|3.0|I was told by so many people that Lacuna Coil was brilliant, that they were better than Evanescence, and that I couldn't live without some of their music that I bought this album without hearing anything. It's okay, but I don't understand thinking they're better than Evanescence. True, the female vocals are comparable to Amy Lee's, but the album is mixed badly, obscuring the lovely voice with the heavy instruments and monotonous, masculine drone of a second singer (I wish there was a &quot;Lacuna Coil is&quot; in the liner notes, but I can't seem to find it). Anyway, despite the unfortunate mixing, the female singer blew me away at first listen, and I really think she should be highlighted on the album rather than obscured; she should do all the singing. <br /> I made the mistake, however, of reading the lyrics. Some of them were good, but some of them were horribly cliche. Studying poetry has made me a bit of a snob, I admit, but with lines like &quot;Oh no! Here it is again! I need to know when I will fall into decay&quot; and &quot;Answer me, it can't be that hard. Cry to relieve what's in your heart&quot; to quote a few from the earlier songs, I can't rise above that snobbishness. Some of the lyrics on &quot;Fallen&quot; from Evanescence are cliche as well, but none off the top of my head are that bad. It was a mistake to read the lyrics, but lyrics are my thing, so that's what I do. <br /> &quot;Aeon&quot; seems to be a favorite song off this album, but it just annoyed me. The intro sounds like a broken record and the song is too short for satisfaction, though the vocals are undeniably beautiful. The rest of the album sounds like the rest of the album. People have made that same accusation of Evanescence, as well as accusing that they are just Linkin Park with a female singer. Meaning no offense to Lacuna Coil (I like Linkin Park) they truly are Linkin Park with a female singer. They've got the heavier sound, the angst, and the metal rapper on EVERY SONG, rather than just one, as is the case on &quot;Fallen&quot;. <br /> Anyway, I'll close that rambling rant. The album is good, but I wouldn't have bought it without the push it got. It is not a &quot;must-have&quot; for Evanescence fans, though some might like it. I don't think it's brilliant, but it's definitely better than most rock out there. I don't think there's much to chose between them and Evanescence, though without the comparison Lacuna Coil sounds pretty good in their own right.
B00006SFLV|1.0|The show &quot;My So Called Life&quot; is basically the teenage-equivalent of &quot;Thirtysomething&quot;. And if you are familiar with Thirtysomething, you'll know that isn't a compliment. Thirtysomething was a show that revolved around evil, self-absorbed yuppie elitists in their 30's. Each person on the series had a mid-life crisis practically ever damn week. If you don't know about the overdramatic whine-fests that are episodes of Thirtysomething, then maybe you're better off. Either that, or you're too young to remember. The characters on My So-Called Life probably will end up like the characters on Thirtysomething. <br />  <br /> I remember when My So-Called Life first aired on ABC in 1994. I was a teenager back then, and it featured kids who were my age at the time. But still, that didn't mean I had to relate to them, and I sure could not and did not. The kids on the show were just depictions of what some 35 year-old TV producer believed &quot;unpopular&quot; kids were like back then. How wrong those 35 year-olds were. For the most part, the kids on this show were gorgeous people who wished they were outcasts. If you've never seen an episode, you can expect the following shown in copious amounts:  <br />  <br /> 1.) Nearly-privilaged kids whining about how their lives and school suck (I wish I had a school with enough funding to have all those dances, afterschool programs, and theater productions like they do). <br />  <br /> 2.) One gay boy who wears lots of eyeliner so teens can learn the stereotype that all gay men wear make-up. <br />  <br /> 3.) Parents that were lifted from the set of Thirtysomething. <br />  <br /> For a show that has fans that call My So-Called Life a &quot;realistic representation of teenage life in the mid-90's&quot; there sure are an alarming amount of stereotyped characters. Some include: Angela was the token &quot;good girl trying to find herself&quot;. Jordan was the &quot;beautiful loser&quot; jock boy who felt the need to runhis fingers through his own damn hair every five minutes and pout. Ricky was the token &quot;gay kid&quot; who only seems to be on the show to reinforce negative gay male stereotypes. Brian was the selfish little prick that didn't deserve to have friends but still managed to have a few. God, I hate these kids and every teen stereotype they perpetuated. When I was a kid, I had no interest in the show after watching bits and pieces of it when the series originally aired (the pace was too slow for me at the time). I finally took a good look at what I'd missed ten years ago while recently reading that &quot;The N&quot; channel was playing reruns. As of this writing, I've now seen nearly every episode to make sure I knew the show and characters well enough to comment. The acting on the show is on par with a what an updated version of those impractical After School Specials would have been. Everything on this show is a fantasy depiction of High School life. Life back then, and especially now, was/is much worse than My So-Called Life makes it seem.
0316666343|4.0|The was an absolutely great book that paved it's way in no time on my list of some of the greatest books ever written.  I can't remember how many times I began crying and had to stop reading for a while, not because I cry easy or that I get overly emotional but because the book and the way the story unfolds has a certain way of including you and lets you feel the pain and the hurt just the way the characters did. It unleashes a river of emotions and in the end inspires you to celebrate life and savour it's glory while you can.  I would highly reccommend it to anyone who has ever experienced the lost of a loved one since it offers great solace and lends the idea that no one is ever really taken from our lives, just placed somewhere else where while we can't see them, they can still see us.
B000054OTY|5.0|Just bought the Platinum Disc Corporation DVD of One-Eyed Jacks, based on a review I read here. The quality is fine - no problems with the picture quality or the audio, and it is a letterbox version. I bought it through Barnes and Noble.com for $5.98 as I had a gift certificate I needed to use. I actually bought their last copy and they said they might not be reordering. At the time of this writing, Amazon is out of stock on the Platinum Disc version as well, but there are a number of them available used and new through Amazon secondary sellers. I was nervous after reading all the terrible reviews of various versions of the DVD. The Platinum Disc Corporation version is fine - no complaints, and very reasonably priced. You can buy with confidence. Hope this helps!
B00006RU5B|5.0|I first heard this CD in my mom's car when she got a copy of it from one of her friends. I didnt really like it, because that was all she would listen to. Back then i didnt like anything my mom liked. But last year i decided to ask her to make a copy of it for me. I got the cd, and listened to it, all the way through. I loved it! This CD is great! I'm a fan of both Soundgarden and Rage Against The Machine, and i think this shows sides from both of these bands. Rage is a little to much rap sometimes, and Soundgarden is sometimes too slow for me. This CD amazed me. It's also some damn good music. Not any rap of course with Chris Cornell singing and nothing slow cuz rage is doing the rest. I like every song on this CD. They are all exceptional. My only complaint is the crazy solos Tom Morrelo starts busting out in the middle of a song. For example, in Bring Em Back Alive, Morello does this crazy solo that i laugh at every time i hear it. They kind of overdid it on that one. Every Song is great because its got Cornell's singing. I'd say he's the best singer alive today. If you get this CD you wont regret it. Listen to Show Me How To Live, really loud with the bass on all the way. its probably the best song on this CD. <br />          Have Fun With This CD, and listen to it LOUD!
B0001AP12G|5.0|This is a must buy. The best album of the year.  Kanye is a creative Kat.  Dc Child out
B000003TA4|1.0|NIRVANA was too simple to become the area-rock band it morphed into over a period of one year. Not because Kurt couldn't handle the pressure of pocketing thousands of dollars a night or shooting all the lucious black tar he could get his grimy little fingers on, but because be wasn't good enough to deserve our hard-earned money. Nevermind is a testament to that. Teen Spirit was the smash-hit, but is so simple it's sad. I wish there was more to Nevermind than meets the eye, but there isn't. There's less. It's all a bunch of meaningless mumbled words with the slur of a junkie you'd come to expect. Lithium doesn't even have a chorus. Any of the lyrics to Cobain's songs are interchangable. He could sing and speak in tongues over an album (which he practically did every record he made), and fans would still eat it up with all the eagerness they can muster. Unplugged, sadly, is the best we'll ever know from Cobain. His stupid &quot;punk ethos&quot; (and drug afflicted addiction) got in the way of his creativity.
B0000DD7LC|4.0|It's unfortunate that in this day and age a singer is not judged upon their singing or songwriting ability but their looks and who they lay with. The Diary of Alicia Keys is very strong lyrically. Ms. Keys has written songs that convey a maturity way beyond her 23 years. These are songs that will be re-recorded 20 years from now; however, she isn't being given the credit that she deserves. Until the day press grows weary of its fascination with the Beyonce's and Britney's of the world, the public will continue to  be bombarded by marginal singing and juvenile lyrics.  My question to Alicia Keys is, who's promoting you? Whomever they are, you need to fire them!  It's time to step up your game and blast the nauseating competition out of the water. <br />
0060512806|5.0|He hasn't mastered the end of a novel so he concocts a symbolic finale.  Otherwise the book is perfection.  For you weens who don't like his digressions: stop reading Stephenson.  Those digressions are his passion; and mine.
B000021XR5|4.0|Down, one of my favorite songs at the moment. everything else is um ok. Some of these songs are pretty good but this album is just not the same as core or purple. stick with early STP unless your a fan.
B0000C9ZLD|3.0|to get into the strokes. i mean, almost 2 years. but after hearing 'reptilia' and 'the end has no end' i finally decided, 'erhm. ok, well, they're pretty good.'  <br />  <br /> now don't take the 3 stars heavily, 3 stars is pretty decent. it's good, worth the buy and to listen too. 4 would be great, 5 is amazing, and 3 is good. and like in another reviewer's recent review, that's just what it is, just... good. <br />  <br /> i never thought i'd finally admit that i do think the strokes are pretty good. <br />  <br /> people will still click &quot;no&quot; on the &quot;was this review helpful to you?&quot; button because they still don't brush their hair, and they still dress like they're making a fashion statement.  <br /> hipsters don't like me.
B0000035E7|2.0|Bleach is an accurate refection of what NIRVANA was, and how each member plays off the others. The album (from a musicianship standpoint) is nothing close to great, but I think it's commendable the band shows its true self on their debut. On Bleach, NIRVANA weren't trying to be Punk by spending only $600 on making the album; they did it out of necessity because they had no other choice. And for what it is, the album is worth a few listens. First off, the sound quality is great. I would have never known it cost so little if it weren't for that proud little blurb at the bottom of the back of the record cover stating so. That shows NIRVANA was once resourceful, which is nice to see. It's a shame Kurt Cobain went for expensive overproduction on Nevermind to make the band sound better than they really were. It's also a shame Kurt paid for expensive computer-trickery on In Utero to digitally and electronically alter the songs to make them sound harsher than they really were (hint: it's most obvious on his screams on &quot;Scentless Apprentice&quot;). As for the Bleach songs, well, there's a great solo in &quot;Blew&quot; but the rest of the song sucks. The standout songs for me were &quot;Scoff&quot; and &quot;Sifting&quot;. Too bad the band didn't have any slower, more pounding tracks on Nevermind or In Utero. The closest NIRVANA ever came to capturing the pounding rhythm of Bleach was on 1992's Incesticide compilation where songs date back to the 1/23/88 session with Dale Crover. And I must say, &quot;Big Long Now&quot; is the mother of all NIRVANA songs.       3.5 stars out of 5
B000003TB6|5.0|I've always loved The Roots. Personally, I think that they are one of the best groups/bands out there. When I first listened to this album, I didn't fall in love with the music like I originally was with Black Star, or Reflection Eternal. This wasn't even my favorite Roots album....Things Fall Apart was. I'll admit, this CD was listened to but not as often as Illadelph Halflife or Things Fall Apart.  <br /> <br />Then over the past couple weeks I decided to give it another listen or two and now I realize what the big buzz about this album is. I'm somewhat mad at the fact it took me this long to appreciate how good this CD was. Now I like it as much as I like Things Fall Apart.  <br /> <br />All the songs are great, but my favorites are Silent Treatment, Distortion To Static, What Goes On Pt. 7 and The Lesson Pt. 1. Essaywhuman?!!!??! and Lazy Afternoon are some pretty funky/cool songs. Lazy Afternoon is a track you could chill and blaze an L to. <br /> <br />I give this album 5 stars because Black Thought and Malik B put it down lyrically. Thought drops some classic verses on this CD. Beats are kind of jazzy but still mainly influenced by hip-hop. The beats pretty much are typical Roots work. I reccomend it to true hip-hop heads who have been peepin The Roots before the last 2 albums have come out. If you like Mos Def, Common, Talib Kweli or Guru's solo stuff then this is for you.
B00005JN2F|2.0|OK, I had a choice of movies to watch last night, and I picked this one because I figured, &quot;It's an action movie. There are going to be a lot of fight/chase scenes and a lot of special effects. I want to see it on the big screen.&quot; Boy, was I disapppointed.  <br />  <br /> For as much as I could see of those big action scenes, I could just as well have listened to it on the radio.  <br />  <br /> Yeah, I like to exaggerate, but it's almost that bad. During the hand-to-hand combat, the camera swings around so much you can't see who's hitting whom half the time. The big car chase (someone actually described it as &quot;the best car chase ever filmed!&quot; -- Puhleeze!) is even worse. I saw the side of a car, some other car, the wheels of a car, someone's silhouette inside a car (not sure whose), some other car spinning out of control, someone's face (&quot;Who was THAT?&quot;), etc., etc., ad nauseum (literally)! I could hardly wait for it to be over. <br />  <br /> Between these exciting totally-stoned-cam scenes, there were long hunks of nothing-much-interesting. Oh, sure, you can see what's going on as long as nothing's going on . . .  <br />  <br /> The plot seemed thinner, somehow, than the first movie. Maybe it's because there was no ordinary-guy/girl sidekick to identify with, so we're just left with Bourne chasing and being chased, like any other formulaic action flick. <br />  <br /> I say, unless you're an action-movie junkie, wait and rent it on DVD. Or, you know, listen to it while you do something else in the next room, since you won't be able to see what's happening anyway. ;)
B0002IQJUK|5.0|So wow. I picked up the Chariot stripped Gavin DeGraw CD right when Circuit City opened, as I had been counting down since I was informed of the release date. I expected it to be about the same as the original Chariot, since it would be the same songs. HOWEVER, wow. It is fantastic. Gavin mixes up the melodies and exposes the limitless perfection of his voice, once again. Each of the tracks is a little slower than the original, and the band mixes up the tablature, really highlighting the best parts of each song. It is much like listening to a completely new album, because the songs are changed here and there, and it makes you want to memorize the new tones, pace, and voice noises (&quot;oooh&quot;) so you can sing along. Sigh. I love it. After a year of perfecting the songs in concerts, there is no way they could get any better at this point. The speed of the songs allows Gavin to show his audience different facets of his amazing voice. I really love the Chariot (track 2 again) acoustic version because he releases so much emotion and you can feel what he was thinking when he wrote the song. Gavin does a fantastic job of portraying his thoughts in his ALL self-written masterpieces. Chemical party features his band with background vocals at the end, to make it feel more personal, as though you were at his concert (as I will be at one in AUSTIN, TX TOMORROW! So exciting!). The bonus, &quot;Change is Gonna Come&quot; is outstanding, because the lovely DeGraw sings his highest note, and just generally portrays the song better than I have ever heard it (it is a cover). If you buy one CD this year, definitely make it this Chariot Stipped album (unless, of course, Gavin releases another album this year. Then you must purchase both). Buy it soon, because it is limited in number (comes with original and acoustic, so VERY worth your money). Great voice. Fantastic range. Many different styles throughout the album. Several different life topics. He conveys every emotion and dramatic detail of his life experiences. Easy to relate to. Makes you want to sing along and never stop listening! GREAT. OUTSTANDING. BEAUTIFUL. In other words...very Gavin-esque.
B000003TAR|1.0|NIRVANA's In Utero is one of the most pretentious, artsy-fartsy albums I've ever had the displeasure of owning. I mean, just look at the awful inlay design! Kurt thought he could not only get away with releasing an album not finished enough for fans, but he also half arsed the inside graphic design (actually, he co-half arsed it). It's a total mess, not to mention very ugly. And yet, all the while, Kurt still has his hypocritical &quot;I'm too rich and punk for you&quot; attitude on full display. Onto the music: None of it's good except for the three singles he released. The rest is crap. Plus, &quot;Kurdt&quot; purposely spent hundreds of thousands of bucks trying to get In Utero to sound organic and raw. Why not actually have it BE organic and raw by spending only spending $600 bucks, using sh*tty equipment and having only seven mixing channels like on Bleach, Kurt? Huh, Why not?! Bleach has a better sound quality than In Utero, hands down. Cobain and the boys wrung very drop of sound quality they could muster out of that $600 dollars. Everything on In Utero just sounds distant and mushy. Most of the songs don't even feature bass. Well, I'm sure they do, but it's inaudible to the human ear because of Albini felt the need to be &quot;Punk&quot; and attempt to live up to others' standards and try to prove his &quot;noize maven&quot; status once again. If you want raw Rock from Nirvana, I suggest you get the real thing and go for Bleach. In Utero is just a simulation and expensive imitation of the low-fi nature of Bleach. In Utero got its cheap sound in a very un-punk and pricey way; the band opted to electronically treat Kurt's screams on several songs so they wouldn't sound as good as Kurt really did sound in the studio. They basically sucked the natural talent and beauty out of Kurt's voice and had a computer make his voice scratchier than normal.
1400034779|5.0|A friend lent this book to me and when she briefly told me what it was about I was very sceptical. How wrong I was to think the story and country would hold no interest for me.  I truly loved it and what is more I got up off my 'Traditionally built' backside and looked in an Atlas to see exaxtly where Botswana is! How many books make you do that? I have lent this and the three follow up books to my Mum and sister and we have adopted a few of the customs we have read about. 'Ko Ko' we call out when arriving at each others houses. We also ask each other if we slept well. Now, if we could only get hold of some Bush tea we would be well away! Don't laugh just read the books and you'll understand.
B000066NW0|4.0|Much controversy arose surrounding the debut of Canadian singer Avril Lavigne. Many people were outraged when Avril's 2002 debut was not a \\"punk\\" album as many claimed it was. As I can recall, Avril herself never claimed to be a punk singer. It was merely a stereotype placed on her since she played guitar and skateboarded. As for rumours regarding whether or not Avril is capable of either of these activities, whether or not Avril herself plays an instrument (and she does in fact play keyboard and guitar as shown on recent performances) is not too big an issue since Avril has a band that plays while she sings. I'm sure it is quite difficult to do both at once and many artists have bands rather than playing themselves. As for whether or not she skateboards, how does that affect her music?       The album opens with a band with the moody fourth single, \\"Losing Grip\\". It's a kind of pop-rock breakup song with great lyrics and a very good beat. They lyrics tell about the way Avril feels at the end of a bad relationship (\\"why should i care? cuz you weren't there when i weas scared. I was so alone.\\"). Avril's voice sounds great in this song as she sings about a relationship gone wrong. The extremely catchy \\"Complicated\\" comes next which talks about a boyfriend/friend who acts differently when they are alone with Avril and when they are with others. It is a very easy song to relate to and Avril sounds awesome in it. The second single, \\"Sk8r Boi\\" follows and it is a song about a girl who breaks up with her boyfriend because of what her friends say. (\\"But all of her friends, stuck up their nose\\") The lyrics are very simple but fit well with the song.       Afterwards comes \\"I'm With You\\", a touching and somewhat gloomy-sounding song (and third single) about loneliness and the need for a change of scenery. It is sung in a very compelling manner and the bridge is particularly strong. (\\"Why is everything so confusing? Maybe I'm just out of my mind\\"). \\"Mobile\\" comes next and seems to be about constantly moving and changing. It is not a personal favourite but it is still a quality song. After this comes \\"Unwanted\\", possibly the least memorable song on the album though it is in no way bad. It is stylistically closest to \\"Losing Grip\\". Avril sings about a love that always ignored her and about how she always tried to belong with him. The lyrics are very convincing and well-written. \\"Tomorrow\\", a mellower track and a personal favourite, follows. In it, Avril sings quietly and sweetly about not being ready to be with someone (after he hurt her?). It has touching lyrics and remarkable background music. (\\"And I want to believe you, when you tell me that it'll be ok, and I try to believe you but I don't.\\").       After that comes \\"Anything But Ordinary\\", a seemingly more personal song. In this one, Avril talks about not wanting to be just like everyone else. The lyrics are extremely simple but generally well-written and add a lot to the meaning of the song. Instead of sounding entirely childish, as this song could have, it shows a different side of Avril. However, it is far from the best song on the album. \\"Things I'll Never Say\\" comes next and seems to be about Avril trying to be perfect for the one she loves while giving the listeners insight about what she is thinking. (\\"If I could say what I wanna say, I'd say I wanna blow you away, be with you tonight...\\"). Her vocals match the style of this song incredibly. \\"My World\\" comes after which seems to be another more personal song. This one talks about growing up in a small town (Napanee). Like \\"Anything But Ordinary\\" the lyrics are a little less mature but convey the message of the song. However, it is not one of the better songs on the album mostly because of the somewhat weaker lyrics.       The final three songs are (to me) album highlights. \\"Nobody's Fool\\" is up first and in it, Avril kind of speaks the lyrics to a tune (rather than singing). Many people (myself included) have called this a kind of rap song but that is not entirely true. This song is one of the more meaningful ones on the album and talks about being yourself and not just agreeing to be whatever others tell you to be. After this comes a personal favourite, \\"Too Much To Ask\\". At one of her concerts, Avril mentioned that this song was written about a real life experience about a crush she had. There is something appealing about this song that I can't quite put my finger on. The lyrics are quite well-written and Avril's vocals are particularly good even though she does not do Christina-Aguilera-style vocal gymnastics. Finally, there is the last track entitled \\"Naked\\". This song is about finding someone who makes you feel figuratively naked, or as if you don't have to hide. (\\"I'm trying to remember why I was afraid, to be myself and let the covers fall away\\"). Most fans do not like this song however I think it has a good message and great vocals.       Overall Mark: 4/5       Overall, Avril Lavigne provided a solid debut containing many enjoyable songs. Though Avril may not be \\"punk\\" as many have labeled her, her album consists of songs ranging from straight pop (\\"Sk8r Boi\\") to pop-rock (\\"Losing Grip\\", \\"Unwanted\\"). Many people have commented that Avril was fed all of her material by her producers however if you take a look at the liner notes you will see that Avril co-wrote every song on the album. Also, whether or not Avril herself played the instruments in her songs, as I've mentioned before, does not matter as she has a band that plays instead and there is nothing wrong with that.
B0002234LS|4.0|The secret window is a very clever movie that I enjoyed a lot.  Johnny Depp once again shows why he is one of the great actors of our time.  He played this role very well as a writer who is struggling with his divorce from his wife.  Depps wife, played by Maria Bello,  has had an affair and is now with the man with whom she had the affair.  Depp begins getting a visit from a Mississippi farmer named Shooter claiming Depp stole one of his stories and changed the ending.  Without giving away too much the Man begins to torment Depp so he will admit to stealing his story. <br /> <br />The acting in this movie was very good as well as visualization.  The person that plays shooter does a very good job.  The is very predictable but that should detour you from getting this movie it is still good  <br />
B00028HBKM|5.0|A Movie Unlike Any Other...... <br />NO I wont say this is EXACTLY what happened... but it is pretty close.... and it is a Movie about Faith.. Christ Died for me.... and thee,,, *****
B000002JPA|5.0|Over the course of my life, I drew closer to heavy metal bands like Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, and early Metallica, while also finding lesser known but certainly ultimate bands like Arch Enemy, Nevermore, Iced Earth, and the like. From there, I got into Rush and discovered a whole new universe practically new to me at the time: progressive rock! I yearned for more and thanks to my friend (thanks, tkdmateo!), he pulled out a CD one day and it would become of the most important albums I've had the pleasure of listening to: &quot;Images and Words&quot; by Dream Theater. They had only released one album prior to this one in 1989 titled &quot;When Dream and Day Unite,&quot; but it wasn't until this album when the band got their sound tightly down and achieved a large fanbase.<br /><br /> At the time, the band consisted of James LaBrie (who just replaced original vocalist Charlie Dominici), guitar virtuoso John Petrucci, drummer Mike Portnoy, bassist John Myung, and keyboardist Kevin Moore. The band is certainly at their prime here, showing great technical skill and prowess with their instruments. The band has their own unique sound that's become quite influential, and in itself it is derived from Pink Floyd, Rush, Queensryche, and Metallica... talk about variety!<br /><br /> The first track and radio hit, Pull Me Under, is an awesome opener with excellent keyboards in the background. It maintains a midpaced structure that was infectious for me. Of course, I wanted to hear more, and then I heard Another Day. A ballad with James' vocals in tip-top shape... the guy can really sing! There's also a saxophone solo, which I quite liked (not for all tastes, but give it a chance). Track #3 is Take the Time, a MASSIVE rocker that just goes everywhere. It's progressive, unpredictable style is enthralling; it's so tightly structured and unbelievable. Surrounded is more of a melodic rocker with some fine guitarwork. It reminds me of early Genesis. And now... the next two tracks (my personal favorites)! Metropolis Part I: The Miracle and the Sleeper is an excellent epic-style track that's also very unpredictable. Dazzling work by all instruments, although James only sings a little bit in the song. Oh well. Still found it to be one of my top favorites. The other one, Under a Glass Moon, is a song that's a rare case; it rocks hard, yet it is also so intensely melodic and has an outer-space feel to it. What an achievement! Another track in which the keyboards dominate. Wait For Sleep, while a nice song, is a really short piano ballad. I wish the band could've spent more time on it, but oh well. The final track and also the album's longest, Learning to Live, is the disc's most optimistic track. This proves that when problems are addressed, they can be solved, which is something many bands neglect to write in their material. It's also the most technically proficient; the guitars and keyboards are at their finest here.<br /><br /> Overall, this is a masterpiece in the most serious sense. In my reviews, I usually don't mention people because I try to be at least half-professional when writing them. However, in this case, I owe my friend a great deal of gratitude (and also to all of you Amazon reviewers that praise the album) for not only exposing me to this awesome disc, but also for opening many new doors in the realm of progressive rock. My voyage in the genre continues even further....(my personal favorites)! Metropolis Part I: The Miracle and the Sleeper is an excellent epic-style track that's also very unpredictable.

B000002JSP|3.0|this here record had the unfortunate side effect of spawning the dave matthews band. don't believe me? give &quot;fool in the rain&quot; another listen.  <br />  <br /> yep.
1400032717|5.0|Just finished this book 30 seconds ago, and while I can't imagine I can add much to the other 362 reviews, I will just say this: if you've been on the fence about this book, treat yourself -- it really IS as wonderful as they say. <br /> <br />And, apologies to Tracey, but Raymond Carver never wrote anything this good.
B0002EXH4A|5.0|This was the first Megadeth album I bought.  At the time I did not like it much, but over the years I came to love it as much as any Megadeth album.  The remastered edition goes far to correct the lack-lustre production on the original release.  The remaster has a full mid and low sound where the original was all treble and background hissing.  I also noticed guitar and drum parts that were almost absent on the original.  The bonus tracks are utterly useless as far as I am concerned, give me unreleased songs not a different version of an old song, but to each his or her own.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. <br />The acting is great and extremely believeable, the story line is intriging, and the music and special effects are out of the ordinary. I saw this movie on TV on Christmas morning and I was a better person for it. It's probably one of the most thought-provoking movies in existence. The only other thing I want to say is that this movie is a bit disturbing, I know it disturbed me, but in the end it's worth it. So overall if you can stand feeling freaked out for a day or so, please do yourself a favor and order this movie now.
0380789035|4.0|The main reason I enjoyed American Gods was that it's about these evil, good, and selfish beings deciding to wage a war on their enemies; the gods says it will be a bloodbath and I won't reveal too much on what happends in the end.  The best parts are when Shadow spends time with the gods, thier conversations and what particular comments they have to say about other gods, about humans, technology, tradition, and other stuff. There a mix of horror and adventure, alot of dreams from the main character, and also an important murder as well.
B00008EY65|3.0|mildly entertaining, but not in the same league as Spiderman and X-men.  Hellboy has some amusing quips as he battles the bad guys, but this is a superficial movie unlike the previously mentioned movies.  Although Hellboy gets knocked around, there is never any doubt he will prevail.  Also, not much original here as the title suggests this is just a mix of the X-Men and Men in Black.  Worth a rent, but not a buy.
B00004RF9B|5.0|First, THANK YOU AMAZON FOR THESE REVIEWS!  <br /> 1997- I was &quot;A Viewer&quot;. <br /> 2004- Please credit me with the name: <br /> Charles Curtis (Charles.curtis@hp.com) <br /> Senior Fibre Channel Engineer / Data Protection Consultant <br /> I work with the largest computer users in the world, and the KRELL &quot;system&quot; beats them all! <br />  <br /> In 1997, I entered the following review, and it is, as of today, July 31st, 2004 number 151 of 151. Tonight, I just watched it again, on Turner Classics, which prompted me to check on my past review, and now update it with the DVD comments. <br />  <br /> Basically, it just keeps getting better. If you haven't seen it. Get It! Simply my favorite movie. Period. Better on DVD now with both standard TV and Widescreen on 2 sides. As to my first review, here is a reprint, to save you from wasting time searching for it. At this time 20 out of 23 people found it helpful. <br />  <br /> 10 Stars! Simply one of the BEST SciFi Movies Ever Made!, July 23, 1997 Reviewer: A viewer  <br />  <br /> OOOhhhh! Fliping through the channels...surfing the cable and ...WOW! What is this? Cool! C57D, a flying saucer with, YES it's Leslie Nielsen as ever-so-serious Captain. <br /> Forbidden Planet, was MGM's high-budget, risky venture at making the one of the finest Color Sci-Fi classics in the 50's. Unlike many of the low budget movies of the genre, FP remains to this day a very entertaining and captivating film. I have to say, that it changed my life as a kid, because it gave me the desire to explore more books about Sci-Fi. Now, I am a Software Engineer with thousands of video tapes. Monster movies are my favorites, and speaking of monsters, the one in FP is on the top of my list of BEST MONSTERS (those you really don't want to ever meet in a dark...even a well lit alley). <br />  <br /> The story: Based on a screenplay by Irving Block and Allen Adler (Fatal Planet), it takes its inspiration from Shakespears's THE TEMPEST. In anutshell, Spacemen come to rescue a lost group of colonists, only to find that most have died long ago. Only Dr. Morbius (Walter Pidgeon) and his daughter Altaira (Anne Francis) remain. They tell Commander Adams (Leslie Nielsen) that 20 years ago, when they first landed, some invisible power killed everyone but Dr.Morbius and his wife (now deceased from natural causes). Soon, we find that the good Doctor has discovered that the KRELL, a once powerful race of aliens, lived below the surface of Altair-4 (where they are) and they created a machine that is 20x20x20 miles square (thats 8000 cubic miles of Klystrons and Relays...and they never stop self repairing themselves!). Well, before you know it, the Monster is back...and people are dying...and well, the big, bad disintigrator beams from the ship's main weapons are NOT stopping it! <br />  <br /> I must mention that this was the first movie with ROBBY THE ROBOT. ROBBY was based on Asimov's Robots Rules of order, and for the most part was just a big lovable teady-bear. He could never hurt anyone, but watch how Morbius proves this by having Robby point a &quot;BLASTER&quot; at the Commander! The way Nielsen clinches his fists was so telling!. <br />  <br /> The sets were beautiful, the saucer flys perfectly (notice the shadows and the dust when it lands). So much here that you simply must watch very closely to the detail, it really is worth it. Speaking of detail, the Monster was pretty easy...because it was MOSTLY invisible. Joshua Meador (on loan from Disney Studios) made the animation of the monster. It is crude by comparison to the new Computer Generated Animation (CGA), but for its time it was AWESOME! The monster, by the way, is powered by 2700 thermo-nuclear reactors, and can recreate itself, microsecond after microsecond! NO! IT CANNOT BE DESTROYED! (You thought ALIENS were tough! HAH!)  <br />  <br /> Well, there is a little love story going on with the Commander and Altaira, and Daddy doesn't like it. Go Figure! Anyway, I won't give it all away, just GET IT AND ENJOY!  <br />  <br /> ... END  <br />  <br />  <br />
B0001UL7RY|5.0|What's up with all the Avril haters? People claiming she `fakes' her image. Ironic that when someone claims to be themselves, the world finds it unbelievable. \\"We better find a way to disprove her, she's not following the bimbo guidelines. She wears a tie, wow she must be trying too hard. She has a unique non-pop sounding voice, therefore: She can't sing. Lets all track every word Avril says, so we can wait until she contradicts herself.\\" But everybody dismiss Christina Aguilera's fake tan, fake hair color, hair extensions, skimpy clothes and trashy lyrics or Mandy Moore's `I'm so wholesome, cute and sweet' image, because that's MUCH more socially acceptable right? So how on earth could someone like Avril; who has the right look, age and sex to sell music through sexual or emotional manipulation, not market herself like that? How dare she. That can't be right!  <br /> <br />Pul - eze! Why is it OK for other celebrities to diss Michael Jackson for example, but for Avril to have an opinion about Britney Spears, it's automatically branded a marketing strategy, she's instantly a spoiled little brat. I'm tired of people thinking it's a bad thing for Avril to come across as a self respecting strong young woman with a take no sh*t attitude who speaks her mind. Fake or not fake, What Avril preaches is simple: Don't bend for others. She clearly demonstrates this on both of her albums. Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't that a um... POSITIVE thing to be encouraging? Especially to teens, who are her main fan base. Give her a break <br /> <br />Don't tip over with the rest of the human dominoes. If you want original music, clever lyrics and individuality. That's exactly what `Under my skin' & `Let go' offer.
B0000C0FJB|3.0|When I used to hear Rush live, both in video and albums, it was always an impressive sound usually better that the studio recordings, the details of the instruments were perfect.<br /><br />Rush in Rio has fallen into the standard Live Audio Sound. The concert itself met Rush standards but the sound ... it just not your usual RUSH LIVE SOUND. I can't say more.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|I LOVE this movie, #1 because of Russell Crowe, #2 because of the devotion to historical accuracy and #3 because of its artistic beauty. I earlier bought one companion book which displayed some features about some of the lesser characters-- the lieutenant who is a poet; Awkward Davies and his tattoo chain; Hollum playing the guitar; Maturin's assistant pulling teeth. ALL OF THIS was deleted from the final cut of the film. However, in the deleted scenes, you get several excellent glimpses of life on the ship that were CUT. And the story would make a lot more sense with them IN. I feel Peter Weir made a big mistake in cutting the &quot;life at sea&quot; scenes. If better edited, the scenes would have only enhanced the story (the Marine who shoots Maturin is shown to be rather gun happy, but not if those scenes are cut!) (Some of th deleted scenes were long but could have been edited down to the freshest and funniest spots-- bad idea Peter!) As a Crowe fan, I am sorry he cut the scene of Russel swimming without his shirt on. (UMPFH! )Well, at least you get to see it if you buy the DVD (the water DOES look like a tank but that could have been fixed, too!). Definitely worth getting if you LOVE THIS MOVIE as I did.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|This CD is a must have. Gavin is amazing. If you have ever seen Gavin in concert, listening to Stripped is just like being in the front row of one of his concerts.  <br />  <br /> I originally bought Chariot about a year ago when I heard the song Follow through and was blown away by this guy's talent.  <br />  <br /> Just when I didnt think it could get any beter then Chariot.... Stripped arrived on the music shelves. <br />  <br /> Some of the standout songs on this CD are definetly &quot;Follow through&quot;, &quot;Just friends&quot;......oh who am I kidding.. they are all great.  <br />  <br /> 1.Follow through has a very mellow beat that is unusually hypnotic. 2. Chariot is simply sexy as he**...simply put, 3. Just friends has an amazing beginning with Gavin going to town on the piano. 4. Nice to meet you anyway (my favorite on this CD) This song is so beautiful. 5.Chemical Party has a get up and jam out beat to it. IT's very catchy. 6. Belief is simple and I get goosebumps in certain areas of this song. 7. Crush, is one of those songs that you keep playing over and over again. 8. I dont want to be, the song that has put him on the radio.. little overplayed for me, but I still like it. 9. Meaning- very cool lyrics. 10- More then anyone- oh wow... dont even get me started on this song... when i heard it, I literally cried. That is how moved I was when I heard it. 11. Overated sounds awesome. <br />  <br /> Are you tired of all the cookie cutter artists out in radio land right now?? Want to be moved and blow away??? Buy this CD now!!!!! <br />  <br /> Jennifer <br />  <br />
B00008EY65|5.0|Before watching this movie, I barely had a clue that Hellboy was even a comic, but the previews looked kinda cool and I had the chance to view it, so I sat down and really had a good time.  There are some fantasic one-liners in this movie and some fun action sequences as well, this was topped off with an interesting story line and some fun special effects.<br /><br />With so many comic books being turned into movies these days, there have been more than a few that have not lived up to what people were hoping, Hellboy on the other hand comes in as a bit of an underdog and scores a knockout punch.  Not that many people are familiar with Hellboy, which helps keep the movie fresh and will have many people excited about a sequel.<br /><br />This was a fantasic movie that blends in comedy and action while delivering a pretty decent and interesting story line.  The movie can be enjoyed by almost all age groups as well.  More movies should strive towards being this entertaining.
B00005JLWN|1.0|I saw this movie twice! I must be crazy right.<br />  Well the first time I saw it I was restless and watching it by myself suffering from insomnia or something. Apart from the last 10 minutes or so of the movie I thought it was overall rather dull and uninspiring. I thought - maybe it's just me, I'm not super crazy about science fiction so it's probably an okay movie if you are into that sort of thing.<br />  The next day I showed the DVD to my landlord (who is a big, big sci-fi fan), he thought it sounded 'interesting' so the next evening we all (five of us) sat down to watch it. I knew I was in trouble when 30 minutes of the way through the movie I heard my landlords voice booming from the other end of the room, 'Tell me it get's better.'<br />  The truth is this movie only 'get's better' minutes before the end. It's drab, dreary, sterile and altogether the most boring movie I have ever seen. I am usually very easy on movies but this one needs a public health warning attached to it so I feel compelled to write this review to warn other possible purchasers to save their money.<br />  The story is very much influenced by 'Fahreheit 451' and revolves around a society where 'feeling' is outlawed. Christian Bale plays a cleric (a policeman with the ability to tell when people are feeling) and (through some power never explained) able to tell where works of art and a room full of candles are through solid walls. He is charged with attempting to inflitrate the resistance and things are going okay until HE accidently knocks over his daily dose of a drug which he needs to not feel. I capatalize HE intentionally, because that point blows apart a gaping plot hole towards the end of the movie.<br />  Avoid at all costs.
B00003CXCT|3.0|If David Horiuchi, the Amazon reviewer, really means it when he says &quot;who cares if Greedo shot first?&quot; then I think his bosses would be wise to reassign him to reviewing exercise videos and pilates tapes. The &quot;new scenes and special effects&quot; severely damaged the trilogy. I don't know, I care about the fact that little edit effectively blew the entire character arc of Han Solo... <br />  <br /> Has anyone done more to tarnish their own legacy than George Lucas has?
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|This is my favorite Miyazaki movie; I like it better than Laputa (Castle in the Sky), Spirited Away, or even Mononoke. As amazingly imaginative and touching as those movies are, I found Nausicaa to be even moreso. It just moved me in a way that is hard to describe. Visualy, the film is just plain beautiful. Even by today's standards. The music, as someone else stated, is haunting. Miyazaki's wonderful inventiveness is at its greatest here; the unusual post-apocaliptic world the film is set in is alive and unique.  <br /> <br />The great tragedy is that I've only been able to watch this movie as a poor copy-of-a-copy fansubed bootleg. It simply has not been available in the States in any other form. Hopefuly we'll soon see what we were missing; props to those responsible for finaly getting this movie released here.  <br /> <br />If you've liked any of Miyazaki's other films, or if you are an anime fan in general, check this movie out.
0767805712|1.0|This movie was terrible. Right from the opening credits in which it looks like it is snowing but which is revealed to be flakes of skin being scraped off, I knew this was going to be a dud. That was just gross. I almost walked out of the theater right there! But I stayed and the rest of the movie confirmed what to me was clear in those first few minutes - this movie sucked! Ugh! For the record, my problem was not with the premise which I found fascinating but with the whole execution which I found strained all believablility...

B00028HBKM|5.0|This film is a masterpiece. This film is able to take a story that most have heard time and time again, and make it real, make it new almost as if it was the first time you heard the story.<br /><br />The Passion of the Christ is violent and not for teens under 15 in my view. This violence is not exagerated, but the historically accurate violence experienced by Jesus Christ. To tone this down would not do justice to the real story of His passion and death.<br /><br />This is a DVD everyone should have in their collection. This DVD is a work that should be viewed once a year. It will make you a better person, and the quality of the work deserves it.<br /><br />One of the best films of all time. It is not coincidence this movie grossed so much money worldwide. It is well deserved.
B000068IEU|1.0|Wes Craven's first picture is a moronic, escessive and unintentionally humorous tale of revenge. The story focuses on two teenaged girls, who are kidnapped on their way to a rock concert by a gang of escaped convicts. The felons bring the two to the woods next to one of the girls' home,  raping and killing them both. After discovering the address to their victems' house, the guilty parties make a housecall. But the late girls' parents uncover the killers dark secret, and exact bloody revenge. Craven utterly fails to shock or disturb the viewer for two reasons; first the actors are unconvincing, and he inexplicable accompanies the scenes of bloodshed with cheerful music. The director also fails to establish the antagonists as the wicked, immoral convicts that they are. Instead they come off as innocent, misjugded people looking to start over. The script is also severly flawed, for example; when the criminals are spending the night at the victems' home, the parents become suspicious. The mother of the deceased, then looks in one of the killers bags, inside she sees a shirt covered in blood. Then she goes to the washroom and find one of the felons inside, this peticular man has the same necklace as her daughter. So for her, this is concrete evidence that these men residing under their roof have killed her daughter. Dashing out of the house, the mother and father, run into the forest and conveniently find their daughter's corps spawled on the ground. Now Suppose, the evidence was sufficient to assume their daughter was dead, why then would the parents impulsively run to the forest in search of her body? The parents revenge is equaly senseless. One of the convicts lets himself be seduced by the wife, after she convinces him to let her tie him up, she proceeds to give him oral sex, ultimately bitting off his penis. Now, the man's hands were tied, and it would have been easier and less emotionally damaging to have stabed him, but instead she castrates him whith her teeth.Perhaps Craven sees this as equal justice, but after that twisted act, you begin to view the felon with sympathy and the wife with comtempt. I believe and hope, that I have illustrated that this abomination is neither worth the time nor money that would be spent on the rental.

0789723107|5.0|This book made me realize the real reason why we are designing websites - for the user. This book made me realize that users will stay on the site for much longer if they can easily navigate it. It focuses on designing how the user would expect you to design (but of course, you can still be creative). And it helps you to put yourself in the user's shoes. It totally changed the way I see web design (in a very good way!). I recommend it to any web designer!
B000002G8H|5.0|This is an example of somethign that is titled wrong.  I just had the opportunity too see Bodge in concert, every Bodge's fan dream!!! And I was close enough to see him play guitar live!! and it was great!  His hands moved really FAST up and down that THING right in front of my face!!  So People should call Bodge Fasthands!  That would make more sense.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|Gavn DeGraw is a amazing artist with his own unique voice.Which needs to be recognized more.I think stripped shows how versitle he really is.It shows that in one take he can hit all the notes.And his vocals are perfect.I would reccomend this c.d. to everyone.I own it myself.So buy it and you wont be sorry you did.
0671027344|5.0|I read this on vacation... and it was really good... it only took me two days (and that was reading only in the evenings) to finish it because i couldn't put it down.  Even if you haven't gone through what charlie has gone through, you feel like you could know him or maybe he is a little piece of you.  Some moments were kinda funny, but it was mostly a great book about what growing up is... and how difficult life can be sometimes.
0688170528|5.0|I was unable to put this book down. Jodi Picoult has perfectly described the feelings of love, loss, grief and devastation in The Pact. I think I must have begun weeping several times while reading this book (on the subway train, in line at the coffee shop, etc.). Not only is the book gripping while you are reading it but it stays with you afterwards, and now I can't stop thinking about it. This is the story of two teenagers who grow up next door to one another from birth, their parents are best friends and have always expected that their children will fall in love and marry each other one day. The book jumps from Chris and Emily's perspective as well as both sets of parents. The novel centers on a suicide pact gone awry and its terrible aftermath (as well as what has lead up to the central moment). There are some rather disturbing and poignant moments in the novel.<br /><br />  This is one of the most moving, touching, thought provoking and disarming books I have read. It certainly made me think about the lives of those around me. Read this wonderful gem, but make sure to keep a box of tissues nearby because this novel will touch you to the core.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I don't care what anyone else says. They special edition Star Wars movies were just as good as the original editions. So what if Greedo shoting first, so what if music from RTOJ was changed (buy the original edition soundtrack), and Luke did not scream while falling from Cloud City. He shouted &quot;NEVER!&quot; to Vader, like he'd rather die than turn to the darkside. <br />  <br /> I can see where some of the changes effected the film, but Lucas is an artist, this is his masterpiece, and he wanted to change what he wasn't proud of. I say this because I am a fellow artist and no matter how good other people may think of my work, I will often feel the need to change one or two things until the masterpiece meets to my expectation. <br />  <br /> P.S. George, I intend to own OT on DVD, but I am waiting until Episode III is done. Then I am hoping for a six-pack collectors edition.
B00000JPYQ|5.0|This album has great music and incredible sound quality.  Maybe UFO was just too far ahead of their time to be appreciated back then. <br /> <br />I certainly appreciate them now.
0385335482|5.0|This is a wonderful book and a great series. Sophie Kinsella is a very talented author. You will keep turning pages and pages and pages to find out what happens next in Beckys embarassing life.She is full of laughs, this is a book you are never going to want to put down.
0679809015|5.0|This book is a favorite with my 21 month old. We got it when she was 18 months old when she already had many animal books. But she always goes back to this one. It has great illustrations and is sturdy, flaps aren't easily wrecked. She shakes her finger at the goat biting on the sock (&quot;no, no bite&quot;). We now 'knock' on the doors before we open them, so it is new all over again to her. She is speech delayed to it is great hearing her try to say 'cockadoodledoo'.
0385336810|5.0|It is a very funny book and Emma is our classic &quot;nothing-special&quot; person. It is a book that is almost like one of those twisted cinderella storys. Emma is funny and dramatic and this is a good book to read when you are in need of a good laugh.
B000002UAI|3.0|there's no doubting the importance and quality of the music of the beatles. the problem with this album, as stated many times before is that is was rushed out before christmas. even in the sleeve notes it says &quot;it isn't a potboiling quick-sale any-old-thing-will-do-for-christmas mixture&quot; which suggests they are trying to justify something. <br /> the 8 originals are fantastic, but most of the covers don't seem to fit in with the rest of the album
B0001611DI|4.0|Hey all, if you are thinking of buying this DVD...DONT!!! <br /> <br />Just wait for the big disk collection coming out soon. I actually thought this DVD was the directors cut..it's not. Don't be fooled. I got the real directors cut on VHS a long time ago and it was UNCUT. But this dvd, is known as the directors cut but it is NOT!!! it has scenes missing. Still watchible, but if I were you, I'd wait for the big set to come out with this version, the TRUE DIRECTORS CUT,the dario version, and DOCUMENT OF THE DEAD. You will thank me.
B000002UDB|5.0|of the 11 tracks on this album, 6 were featured on #1 singles (Strawberry fields forever/penny lane; All you need is love/baby you're a rich man; hello goodbye/i am the walrus)  the other 5 tracks are all gems, the only downside of this album is the running order.  we all know that side A was the soundtrack side and side B was the collection of singles from the time, but the album would benefit from changing around the order of songs now it is available on CD rather than vinyl
B0000DJZ9T|5.0|Everyone who has gushed about this DVD/CD combination has been far too restrained.  Coldplay's melodies, musicianship, lyrics and overall sound are AMAZING!!!!  The production values on the DVD regarding cuts, pans, scans, etc are top-notch. <br /> <br />Folks whose memory spans back to some of Zep's live concerts or perhaps to Yessongs will not be disappointed. <br /> <br />This band, this CD, this DVD totally rock!!!!
B0002IQJUK|5.0|Gavin DeGraw's Chariot contains 11 songs that move the soul. Directed more at a teen/ youg adult audiencel, Chariot can be appreciated by all age levels. Gavin plays from the heart and shows in his voice and his music. Each song has a beautiful melody and is full of passion. Gavin loves what he does and that is what it takes to make a great CD. There are songs for all occasions whether you are happy or sad. On the CD there are songs both up beat and those more mellow. Not only is Gavin extremely talented but his band is incredible and they back him up nicely without overpowering him. I hope to see more from him very soon!
B00005JLEX|5.0|Obviously, I'm not the only one who is willing to spend a lot of money on the Seinfeld Series DVDs.<br /><br />I've been waiting to add this series to my DVD collection for years. I still look forward to watching the show (which is on several channels at the same time) every night, whenever possible.<br /><br />Give the people what they want! The demand is huge!
B000002H97|4.0|I personally like Ride the lightning, Master of puppets, and Justice for all better. But this album still is very good. Ok, so the guitars aren't mind numbingly fast, and the songs are a little less complex. That doesn't mean it's bad. Songs like Enter sandman and Wherever I may roam make up for the worse songs like The god that failed and My friend of Misery. Here's a rundown of the songs. <br /> <br />1.Enter Sandman-10/10 Awesome solo <br />2.Sad but True-9/10 <br />3.Holier than thou-9/10 <br />4.Unforgiven-10/10 <br />5.Wherever I may Roam-10/10 One of the best <br />6.Don't tread on me-9/10 <br />7.Through the never-8/10 <br />8.Nothing else matters-9/10 <br />9.Of wolf and man-9/10 <br />10.The god that failed-7/10 <br />11.My friend of misery-7/10 <br />12.Struggle within-8/10 <br />Overall-Buy it after RTL or MOP. You won't be dissapointed.
6300214435|5.0|This one is often the least favorite of many but not for me. In fact Temple of Doom is in fact my favorite of the bunch.  <br /> <br /> Indiana Jones is in 1930s Shanghai China and has been making a deal with a Chinese mafia leader but after an altercation, he escapes until things go wrong when the plane goes down in India and he ends up in a village where all of the children have been kidnapped. It turns out that they were taken to an underground diamond mine that is run by a Satanic Thuggee cult lead by Mola Ram. The cult worships the evil god Khali and Indie must rescue the children and retrieve the stones.  <br /> <br /> This one is my favorite of them all. I like them all but TOD is the best of them. I love it's dark and sinister tone and the incredible action sequences especially towards the latter half. Some scenes were a bit troubling and even stereotypical but overall, Spielberg and Lucas hit the high mark on here. Go and buy this movie but get it on the DVD set immediately.
0783117523|5.0|I have not even seen this movie in its entirety (hope I spelled that right) but an Angelina Jolie movie with lesbian scenes . . . sorry hard to type with one hand ;)

0374384576|5.0|Roald Dahl's &quot;The Witches&quot; was highly recommended to me by one of my piano pupils, a gentle, sweet-natured 11 year old ballerina.<br /><br /> I found it an utter pleasure, despite the fact that I am the kind of mother who found Grimm's fairy tales to be much too grim, and censored them for violence, when I read to my young children.<br /><br /> Dahl's fantasy is presented in matter-of-fact, ordinary language as if it were a newspaper story, and that is part of the enchantment. The narrator takes you in and bears you along in a story that becomes ever more fancifully bizarre. When you reach the ending, which would seem bleak if not for the cotton-candy spun delight of the story, you take it in stride.<br /><br /> &quot;The Witches&quot; is not for the literal-minded child, but for children who can understand a story as an exercise in imagination, it is highly recommended.
B0000CABBW|4.0|&quot;Dedicated to those who have gone before.&quot; Wow. Absolutely gorgeous scenery in this movie. New Zealand? Goodness. Sign me up I want to go. Lush greens and beautiful ocean. The people? Diverse (with pretty cool accents). This one is heavy on tradition. The old ways mingled with some modern conveniences. One family's tragedy taken to an enlightening conclusion. It's an interesting film. Through most it, I just wanted to give that little girl (Keisha Castle-Hughes) a big hug (i.e., she's a good actress). Funny how the most stubborn and seemingly uncaring individuals somehow end up being the ones who care the most. It's just a shame that to realize it, an exceptional event must take place, which isn't so typical, but certainly entertaining. Expectations based on potential is one thing. But governing a life (and those to come) based on gender and family tradition alone is another matter altogether. Oppression sometimes inspires miracles. Such is the case here. A rather beautiful one at that. Time to break the barriers and allow a new tradition to evolve. I definitely recommend this movie. If nothing else, it's a poignant reminder of how differently people in other parts of the world live.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|Nothing is wrong with Beatles 1 in form. The music that is on the disc is fine (while \\"Please Please Me\\" would have been better than say \\"We Can Work It Out\\" and \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" better than that dud \\"Yellow Submarine\\" if we are stuck at 27).      It's what this disc lacks that is its fault. Under-representation of John Lennon, and ignoring many of their great album songs. Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Rubber Soul, and 'The White Album' all are without an ambassador on this disc, and Revolver without its best works. I thought Beatles 1 was definitive till I heard \\"Back In The U.S.S.R\\" on a old discarded casette I found. Before I knew it 'The White Album' opened up to me like a glass onion.      I'm not going to give my personal list of favorites I feel are missing. Every time I've counted the \\"must-have\\" songs of the Fab Four, the number has approached at least 100 songs (over 70cuts missing), not to mention some of the solo work the four did after the split.      I'm not going to fault this effort. It isn't definative, obviously. But it's very capable of \\"hooking\\" a person (myself included). Give it as a gift to a child. They will be hooked forever. I believe that was the true goal of this disc.      I used to fault the Beatles for not creating a true greatest hits (the Red and Blue albums are de-facto) but now I know why they didn't. Their albums are truly meant to be experience in sequence.       The thirteen original albums, two single-collections (Past Master's), and the three Anthology can follow on.      All in all, a great sample, but as said, not definative.      ****
B0001MDP3G|5.0|This was a wonderful love story and was played well by the cast of Cold Mountain.  I will eagerly by the DVD to add to my collection.  The chemistry of this cast is worth the price of admission.
B000067CPX|5.0|mastering the art of funk rock and paving the way for rap rock, the red hot chili peppers have successfully done what many bands cannot do: change their sound without alienating their fanbase. the chili peppers do exactly that on their 2002 release 'by the way', a melodramatic joy ride through wavy guitar work from john fruiscante, funky bass lines from flea and sweet and calm vocals from anthony kiedis. the album isn't like their 1999 release 'californication' so if you were expecting a duplicate of it then you're mistaken. throughout the album's 16 tracks, the sound changes from time to time, from the funky bass lines and pounding toms of the opening title track to the soft, beach boys-like anthem of 'tear'. one of the most stand-out tracks on the album is 'can't stop', an homage to their old funk rock days and proving to everybody that they've still got it. even simple commands like in the track 'throw away your television' has everybody hooked because of its jungle beat and bass lines. <br /> <br />this album deserves a definate listen from everybody, even if you don't like their new sound. the chili peppers have grown out of their drug-induced lifestyle and have learned from their mistakes. 'californication' was a bittersweet symphony from their past, and now 'by the way' is a celebration of their transition from silly funk rock to classic potential for a spot in the rock n roll hall of fame.

0451527046|2.0|&quot;Treasure Island&quot; is a classic. Why foul it up by making <br /> it 'easier to read'? That is just being condescending to <br /> young readers, and evidently, going by one of the other  <br /> reviews, they didn't do a very good job of THAT, even. <br /> Read the original, skip any of the adaptations....
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This is a great CD. There is alot of controversity over this album but if your a true Maggot youll accept what they are trying. Its differnt only 2 cuss words. one in duality-Bitch and one in Pulse of the maggots- Bastard, But is that what everone rates them on is how much they cuss. The Screaming is in a different style thats sounds pretty damn good. Id say its their best album yet. Yes their is some acustic guitar in 2 of their songs but the songs are exellent. They still have most of their heavyness, they just added more of a melody to their music.if you didnt like Slipknots first 2 albums try this one cuz it is differnet. So if you dont like this album, you have a bad taste in music and/or you shouldnt call yourself a Maggot cuz only true fans of Slipknot can be called Maggots, which means you go with what slipknot does.
B00005JNH0|5.0|After watching this movie, it's obvious why St. Anger was such a suck album. Somebody really needs to introduce Lars to &quot;the earth&quot; again cause obviously he has lost all touch with reality. (least) Favorite line: while auditioning bass players, Lars says &quot; If Cliff WAS here, HE probably wouldnt have made it &quot;. WTF!!!!! At one point, Lars bitches beacuse he has to play the drum part thats &quot;too hard&quot; over and over again. Dude, get a grip. For the love of God Kirk, PLEASE GROW A PAIR AND STAND UP FOR YOURSELF!!!!!
B00000D9TQ|4.0|Phil Collins has had SO many hit singles, that a greatest-hits package was inevitable. &quot;Hits&quot; collects a big 74 minutes-worth of Phil's best-known tunes, such as &quot;In The Air Tonight,&quot; &quot;You Can't Hurry Love,&quot; &quot;One More Night,&quot; &quot;Sussudio,&quot; &quot;Take Me Home,&quot; and &quot;Another Day In Paradise,&quot; to name but a few. The album also collects for the first time Phil's hits from movie soundtracks, such as the smash &quot;Against All Odds,&quot; his hit duet with Marilyn Martin, &quot;Separate Lives&quot; (where is Marilyn Martin these days, by the way?), &quot;Groovy Kind Of Love,&quot; and &quot;Two Hearts.&quot; There's also his hit duet with Philip Bailey, &quot;Easy Lover,&quot; AND one brand-new track, a cover of Cyndi Lauper's hit song, &quot;True Colors&quot; (which I happen to like better than Cyndi's original version!). And yet, &quot;Hits&quot; is an incomplete Phil retrospective, as there are a handful of surprising ommissions---&quot;I Missed Again&quot; (which was Phil's very first hit single), &quot;I Don't Care Anymore,&quot; &quot;Don't Lose My Number,&quot; &quot;Do You Remember,&quot; and &quot;Everyday.&quot; Obviously, these were left off the album due to lack of space, but still, it's a disappointment. Hopefully, Phil will one day get a proper *2-disc* set of his biggest tunes, which would solve the problem right there. I can see it now---&quot;The Essential Phil Collins&quot;! They could also toss in a few extra goodies, like &quot;Thru These Walls,&quot; &quot;Oughta Know By Now,&quot; &quot;You'll Be In My Heart,&quot; &quot;Can't Stop Loving You,&quot; and &quot;Testify.&quot; I'm sure it'll happen eventually. For now, though, &quot;Hits,&quot; while incomplete, is still a very cool Phil Collins collection.
B000003TAR|5.0|As far as &quot;grunge&quot; goes this album fits into the moniker snugly. The sound is raw, heavy, and sludgey all the things the term denotes. Grunge consisted of four bands which broke the music barriers of the day and age. They were Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice In Chains.  <br />  <br /> Each had their own commercial radio hit that drove them into excess of 10 million sales EACH. Pearl Jam had Ten, Soundgarden had Superunknown, Alice in Chains had Dirt, and of course Nirvana had Nevermind. But beneath all the glamour and glitz of grunge each artist had their own musical masterpiece which went completely under-appreciated. Pearl Jam's No Code, Soundgarden's Badmotorfinger, Alice in Chains self-titled lp, and Nirvana's In Utero.  <br />  <br /> Far and away from the overly produced Nevermind In Utero stands as an artistic triumph for the band. The lyrical competence underwent a change as Kurt's song matured from the turbo-charged punk of Nevermind into complex and meaningful songs. &quot;She come's back as fire to burn all the liars, Leave a blanket of ash on the ground&quot; from Frances Farmer is the perfect example of deep and thought provoking words.  <br />  <br /> The instrumental work is also much tighter here with better musicianship from Grohl and Noveselic but from Cobain especially. Gone is the sloppiness from past works. Grohl's drumming is truly professional here with beats and pounds to match any of the past greats. Novoselic's bass is above competent and he really contributes to the band which seemed to be missing from earlier works. <br />  <br /> However,In Utero is by no means for first time listeners. It's sound hits you like a needle driven in through you're ear and pulled out and stabbed repeatedly. While Nevermind was a much friendlier album Kurt took In Utero into a new direction from the depression he was feeling and his intense abuse of herion. People just getting interested in Nirvana should start of with the seminal Nevermind or their self titled 'Greatest Hits' collection. For people looking for art as music this is it.  <br />  <br /> Tragically, following the path of Andy Wood the singer of Mother Love Bone who OD'ed on herion Kurt imploded killing himself in a herion induced hell in '94. Other greats such as Layne Stanley would fall and other bands would crumble but the early 90's will always be remembered as one of the best times in music history. Period.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|As many people have heard of Gavin from his song &quot;I Don't Want To Be&quot; on The WB's hit show, One Tree Hill, this remarkable marketing strategy has given the musician continuing curiosity with his music.  <br />  <br /> As a fan, I learned about Gavin from a magazine, and proceeded to purchase his cd because I thought he might be really good. And I'm glad I did that because it was the best investment I have ever made.  <br />  <br /> Gavin's debut disc, Chariot, is a remarkable set of piano-driven tunes with vocals that exemplify the passion that he holds for music. When he sings the lyrics to each song, you feel that he's really experiencing the emotions each song showcases. It doesn't seem like a song just put together for an album, but it sounds like each word he sings, is something he truly feels.  <br />  <br /> I think it is difficult for someone to pick the best songs on Chariot, because it is such an excellent debut, but given the fact that is a review, I should choose some that showcase Gavin the best. I think &quot;Chariot&quot; is one of the best songs because it just gives his music an overall impressive light to what he is singing about. Another song, &quot;Meaning&quot;, is very interesting. The beginning of the song is very catchy, and if you listen to the words, [no pun intended] the meaning shines brightly.  <br />  <br /> The fact that Gavin has decided to completely stripped away the full-band element of the original recording of 'Chariot', it gives him more credibility as an artist because he wants to showcase his true talent, vocally and musically. Each song shines on the record, especially &quot;Chariot&quot;, &quot;[Nice To Meet You] Anyway&quot;, and &quot;Belief.&quot; The stripped, personal songs feel as though you are at a live show of his. Though, the listener is given this advantage with this record, it doesn't take away the joy and excitement of going to see Gavin truly play a live show. <br />  <br /> I think this disc an excellent investment for curious fans to hear from him before going to a live show. And it is a definite necessity to his already dedicated fans.
B00000IQW5|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. Simple, moving - it makes me laugh and it makes me cry. I tell people that it's a movie that slipped through without being noticed, and I'm not sure why.... Whenever I need to feel at home - I watch it.
B000286S8S|3.0|It's no secret that there's a deep animosity between Van Halen-particularly their leader,guitarist Edward(i.e Eddie) Van Halen-and their former frontman,David Lee Roth.His 1985 departure was acrimonious,and while his solo career paled in comparison with Van Halen's continued success with Sammy Hagar as their frontman,the group never escaped the shadow of DLR.No matter how many #1 albums,hit singles and sold-out shows they had,fans and critics alike preferred their gonzo days with Roth,and kept hounding the band for a reunion.Eddie held his ground for years,but once the band commercially stumbled with 1995's Balance,he reconsidered,courting Dave for an ill-fated semireunion on the 1996 Best Of album-a move that not only resulted in 2 enjoyable if underwhelming songs,but also the alienation of Sammy,who either quit over the matter or was fired(depending on who you ask).After that debacle,Van Halen chose former Extreme singer Gary Cherone for 1998's Van Halen III,but instead of being a new beginning,the album torpedoed both the band's career and their record contract.Years passed with no activity,and the silence whetted the appetite for a reunion-which for many meant one with Dave,not Sammy,but bad blood can run deep,so when Edward pulled the rest of the group together for a comeback tour in 2004,he chose Hagar as the frontman.To promote the tour,they put together a new hits compilation,the doubled-disc,36-track Best Of Both Worlds.On the surface,it seemed like the the ideal solution to the problems that plagued the first,half-baked Best Of,which at one disc couldn't possibly have fit both the best of both the Dave or Sammy years,but Best of Both Worlds turns out to be yet another botched collection,and one of the reasons it doesn't work as well as it should is that animosity toward David Lee Roth.                                                            Since the band's sound and massive popularity were built on the records they made with Roth,there was no way for Van Halen to ignore his contribution,but they do their damnest to diminish it here.There are no pictures of Diamond Dave to be found(unless small reproductions of the covers of VH1 and Women An Children First count) and David Wild's essay only mentions him twice-once when he joins,once when he exits-while conspicuosly lavishing praise on Sammy.As petty as this swipe is,it's understandable and could even be forgivable if the 2 discs were well assembled,but it's sabotaged by the absurd,jarring Dave-song-followed-by-a-Sammy-song sequencing,causing a whiplash change of tone,mood,and attitude(i.e Runnin With The Devil with When It's Love)with every song,which are otherwise well-chosen,containing most of the biggest and best from both eras(the only exceptions being the boneheaded move to end the collection with 3 live cuts with DLR songs all sungs by Sammy and the 3 lame new songs with Sammy).This attempt to elevate Sammy Hagar above David Lee Roth in the canon is a bit like trying to say Ronnie James Dio was more important to Black Sabbath than Ozzy Osbourne-a piece of flat-out hyperbole that does a disservice to what the singer really achieved.David Lee Roth was larger than life,a gonzo performance artist touched with genius who made Van Halen seem bigger,siller,grander than any other heavy-metal or AOR oufit at the time;with him in front,they were giants,they were the Golden Gods Of Rock'N Roll.Sammy Hagar was his total opposite,an ordinary-average guy who sang about girls and tequila,someboby who brought Van Halen back down to earth.Since part of the fun of rock stars is to have them larger than life,a manifestation of the audience's dreams,fans naturally gravitate towards the DLR years,but there are merits to both approaches and both resulted in good to great music.But that's hard to apperciate on Best Of Both Worlds,when the Dave and Sammy tunes are mixed up with no regard for chronological,musical,or emotional cohesiveness.The raw materials are here for a great VanHalen compilation-it's just up to users to take these 36 songs and sequence them at home to make this the the compilation it should have been.
0790731452|4.0|Before Tim Burton did that rotten Planet Of The Apes remake with Marky Mark(Feel the vibrations! Feel it, Feel it!  Feel The Vibrations!), he made this bizarre sci-fi comedy.  I am actually quite surprised the Hollywwod studios ok-ed this film coz anymore a director can't have a big budget unless the film is a remake of a superior film, derivative of a superior film, a cruddy adaptation of a comic book, and stars Ben Affleck, Vin Diesel, J. Lo, or Orlando Bloom.  Sorry for the run on sentence.  Tim Burton usually makes films with off the wall concepts, and they usually ended up being great movies.  I mean, I don't know of any other guy who could have taken a concept like Edward Scissorhands and made it a great movie.  Plus, he made the only good Batman films.  Mars Attacks is also an off the wall Tim Burton project(based on trading cards!), but was met with more criticism both from critics and fans alike.  Sure, some of the humor is hit and miss, but you can't help but admit that this film is quite unique.  I can't remember the last time so many stars were crammed into a B-masquerading as an A-film.  I can buy Jack Nicholson doing it, but it's strange to see Pierce Brosnan, Rod Steiger, Paul Winfield and Michael J. Fox in all this craziness.  After that rotten Apes crud, Burton would redeem himself with Big Fish.  Most people have seen Mars Attacks already, but if you haven't, it won't kill ya to watch it and decide for yourself whether it's a work of genius or a total misfire.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|Gavin Degraw's Chariot Stripped is a soulful remastering of his already exceptional debut album.  The most gratifying aspect of listening to this CD is that the listener can actually hear the love Gavin has for his craft in his voice.  You can almost feel the pleasureable pain he experiences while hitting the strongest notes.  Chariot Stripped showcases Gavin's talent as a live performer; anyone who has never seen him live will certainly be compelled to immediately check his tour schedule.  I could not have asked for anything more out of this CD.  It cements Gavin as one of, if not my absolute, favorite artists.  Well done, Mr. DeGraw.
B00012FXB8|3.0|I would give this film 4 stars only because the performance of Sigourney Weaver as Ripley, now a cinematic icon, raises it above the pack. Otherwise, it is often too repetitive--'Aliens' without the flamethrowers--though the cast makes a valiant effort to separate this film from its predecessors and nearly succeeds. Perhaps it deserves  four stars anyway based on its status as a cinematic icon. Some of the special effects early in the film are pretty awesome. The idea of having a woman crash land on a male prison colony is a promising one, but two of this film's leaders, the prison doctor and the prison warden, are killed off early leaving a significant leadership gap which is put in the questionable hands of Charles Dutton and his fellow prisoners. The early part of the film is suspenseful, as Ripley requests an autopsy of Newt from Aliens and has a brief affair with the medical director. After the prison doctor and warden die,and Sigourney comes face-to-face with the alien, the film suffers from plodding direction though it is full of chase scenes and there are some nice moments, such as when the alien, covered with molten lead, rises up and is smashed to smithereens by the sprinkler system, presumably because of the temperature difference. Charles Dutton also makes a solemn pact with Sigourney to kill her (because she is carrying a queen alien) after killing the alien, an idea that works pretty well. The idea that the scientists have no interest in the prisoners or in Sigourney as people but want to use the alien for questionable research goals is also a good one. Like the previous film, this film is bathed in red as a primary color and I for one don't see much difference between the two facilities.   The film I will compare it to is Kevin Bacon's 'The Hollow Man.' While \\"Alien 3\\" is pretty serious, \\"Hollow Man\\" has some comedic elements that were also present in the original \\"Invisible Man\\" which it resembles. 'The Hollow Man' starts out as apparently about scientific research, with Bacon playing an egotistical scientist in Washington, D.C. who is able by quantum physics to make living creatures disappear and reappear again. For this he receives government funding. They decide with all gravitas to try this technique on a human.Full of interesting special effects and computer graphics , the film soon degenerates into a horror/comedy film of somewhat low repute as Bacon himself disappears and uses this advantage to seduce unsuspecting women and to kill people. This transformation from mad scientist to evildoer is not totally out of keeping with the original \\"Invisible Man\\". There is quite a bit of blood and gore and also some pretty exciting action sequences including scenes in a freezer and elevator shaft and in the end, everybody has a good time, so this movie, despite its ridiculous nature, probably deserves 4 stars for the special effects, if nothing else.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|This is by far the most amazing CD that has come out in a long time. The songs touch a place deep in your soul. Since I got it, a day hasn't gone by that I haven't listened to it. Love it love it love it!
B0001ZX0OC|3.0|This movie was fairly good but not exceptional. The story centers around three childhood friends that are reunited 25 years later when the daughter of one is murdered. Though Sean Penn has proved to be an outstanding actor in other roles, I didn't particularly like him as the father of the murdered girl and wasn't really moved by his performance.  Tim Robbins' acting was moving and I thought he was the best part of the movie. Kevin Bacon was also very good as the cop investigating the murder. The supporting cast added little to the movie and the actress that played Sean Penn's wife was irritating to say the least. Even when she wasn't speaking, she was irritating. For a movie to be exceptional, I think the audience has to care about the characters. Most of the characters in this movie aren't very likeable and seem to have few redeeming qualities.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Firstly lets get the Nu-Metal label out of the way. Ok now Slipknot it Nu-Metal. There really is no comparing Linkin Park to slipknot. It's a completely different sound. It's like callin The Beatles hardcore punk. The nu-metal label is foolish. Secondly why should a band have to keep to the same style throughout their albums? It gets boring if the sound is exactly the same as previous albums. Led Zeppelins first 2 albums, for the most part were of the Blues style. However they then turned to the heavier scene. What made them such a good band was the ability to change their style. Linkin Park have managed to do this, just not on such a grand scale. If they kept the style completely the same, other fans would get put off. Either way there will always be someone who complains. Once again the timeless crap about the average Linkin Park fan being 12. Can't you rant about something different? Basically when I saw Linkin Park, the average age of fans was round about 18. There were a fair few in the crowd aged about 20-30. The lyrics are very thought provoking if you bother to listen to them. Which is more than can be said for the mindless crap that is coming from your average run of the mill bands. I mean seriously even newer bands such as The Darkness hardly have any meaningful lyrics. The theme of the album is not unlike Hybrid Theory with, excuse the overused phrase &quot;teenage angst&quot;. It is actually a message of hope to a lot of people. You've heard people say that artists music has changed their lives and why shouldn't it? As many know Chester had a bad childhood, not unlike Eminem. The difference being that Linkin Park was able to get their message across without having to litter their album with swearing and violent lyrics. And this message really comes across in the new album. Breaking the Habit could be linked to drug abuse and how its a good thing to become free of such substances. They have managed to increase the 'heaviness' in some areas and mellowed down a number of songs. Like many albums, it takes a while to get used to it. Not that the songs are bad, they're just different. If you call yourself a Linkin Park fan, buy this album. If the only reason you liked their previous album was based solely on the rap or metal content, don't bother with this one.
B000000WJZ|5.0|In an era where musical creativity has hit an all time low it is incredible to look back to a band that seemed to put considerable effor tinto every aspect of the music they were making. The Smashing Pumpkins, thanks to Billy Corgan, were one of the most influential and groundbreaking bands of the last generation. If you sit and listen to the tracks on Siamese Dream you will not know what to expect next. This is what makes this band so great: they can go from a hard hitting anthem to a slow melodic gem all in one album. However, one cannot listen to either of the tempos and decide that The Smashing Pumpkins should stick to one style or the other, for they do both with impecable skill. It is impossible to name the best songs on this album because they are all masterpieces! The guitar work is exquisite, although in most songs it is very simple save the solos. This is gleaming proof that quality not quantity is the most desirable path. Enough said for the music. The most catching and intoxicating part of this album, and all Smashing Pumpkins songs for that matter, is the lyrical geneous! Billy Corgan, while being one of the most incredible guitarists of our time, is also one of the most overlooked poets of our time. Most will not take the time to read and desypher his verses of squalor, maudlin, and angst, but would be very pleased if they did. Corgan deals with many issues in his songs from religion (Hummer) to heartache (Soma). With the devotion in his lyrics it is easy to see why he &quot;...never released a song that didn't mean something to [me].&quot; If you like rock music, I strongly encourage you to pick this up. All Smashing Pumpkins records are incredible, save maybe Machina.
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|I read all the reviews on here and most people are just either basing it on My Band (which sounds nothing like the rest of the album, fyi) or not really basing their disses on anything, just coming on here to diss just for the hell of it. All I have to say is get your kicks some other way, cuz all you're doing is annoying the people who actually have something legitimate to say, the only thing you're pointing out is your own stupidity- anyways- <br /> <br />this album I think is better put together than Devils night was. The songs sound more 'tied together' (the only way I can think of to describe it) but they each have their own sound. My Band does sound a little out of place, but I think it's a lot better than a lot of the other stuff on the radio right now. All the members are very talented including Bizarre. Yes he isn't as good as the others flow wise, but he has very creative and interesting lyrics, and his flow is all part of his charm. Eminem steps back on this album like he said he would, and isn't near as prominent as he was on Devil's Night letting the others stand out, and that's a good thing. This is one of my favorite cds right now. These guys are definitly not victims of the sophomore slump- major props- 5 stars, very nice
B00008NG5V|3.0|It's a pretty good album - solid, melodic, peaceful.  But it's lacking something that Brushfire Fairytales had: variety and spirit.  There's comfort in On and On, but it just doesn't pop the way its precursor did.
B00005JL3A|4.0|Okay, everyone.  This is a movie based on a popular video game.  Enough said.  Now, as a movie, it is a fast-paced, roller coast ride of a film.  We're not talking HAMLET here, folks.  Director Paul Anderson keeps the action fire hot, and the cast play their roles as one would expect in this kind of movie.<br /><br />The visual effects (for a non video-game fantatic like me) are well done, and there are some jump out of your seat moments.  Milla Jovovich, who was so good in FIFTH ELEMENT, has a rubber face that displays a wide range of emotions for a basically undeveloped character.  Michelle Rodriguez overdoes the tough girl part, but is effective nonetheless.  Eric Mabius gives Matt both a tough and sensitive edge, and redeems himself for BLACK CIRCLE BOYS.  Martin Crewes as Caplan is quite good, as is James Purefoy (A Knight's Tale) in the role of Jovovich's undercover lover.  The monster dogs, zombies, laser killer and chief monster are all well done, and the movie's apocalyptic ending certainly leaves room for the upcoming sequel.<br /><br />I enjoyed this much better than MORTAL KOMBAT, so I'm looking forward to the sequel.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|Something to jam to... something to cry to... something to laugh at. Gavin fills in all the gaps and covers every subject there is. Gavin's the only thing that makes me jump-up-and-down happy. That's an accomplishment, and so is Gavin. Chariot Stripped is my favorite CD. You can't put him in a box, you can't categorize him, and you can't tell him to do something one way because that's what everyone wants. You can't compare him to another artist because he isn't like any other artist. He's completely his own genre. I don't like too much voice in a song like Usher. Too many instrumentals can be boring, too. Gavin balances this very well, and you never get bored. Stripped has so much feeling in it, after a while you feel like you almost know him personally. He's the best male singer I've heard. He's down with his fans; he doesn't snub them because he thinks he's better. Gavin's band is awesome, too. Without them, it would be Gavin and his piano. So go band! And rock on Gavin!
B000007U6V|4.0|Autobahn might have been the first album that gave Kraftwerk their breakthrough but they already released three albums prior, Kraftwerk 1, 2, and Ralf & Florian. It's little wonder why they're so obscure, those albums are so &quot;out there&quot;, that it's truly not recommended for those who like their more accessible later albums (but of course, those who like the more unusual Krautrock acts out there would probably like those albums). Autobahn, released near the end of 1974 was their first chart-topping album. Wolfgang Flr was the new member of the band, and they added Klaus Roeder (who only appeared on this album) on electric violin. The title track became a hit when edited for single release. This title track is much more accessible than most everything they done before, but this cut relies on repetition and droning sounds, often simulating the drive on an autobahn (complete with the sounds of cars and car horns). Flute and guitar are also present, along with the synthesizers. This was the first time vocals were used on the album, and this song was sung in German. But unfortunately the rest of the album gets ignored, which isn't fair. The second half of the album is all-instrumental, and a lot less accessible. This music harkens back to their pre-Autobahn albums, highly experimental music with lots of bizarre synthesizers, and one using electric violin. That last cut, &quot;Morgenspaziergang&quot; I can live without, going for more of Bavarian sound complete with dulcimers. It's basically a theme from &quot;Autobahn&quot; with recorders and dulcimers that don't quite work. Regardless, a great album to have in your collection.
B00000C28M|5.0|All the Brahms I like is &quot;un-Brahmsian&quot;: Furtw&auml;ngler, Toscanini, Horowitz, and yes, Bernstein!.<br /><br /> In general Gould's approach against ROMANTIC tradition was right through; for Romanticism cannot be taken fully seriously at all (just look at Byron, perhaps the quintessence of it). Now Brahms is not only serious, but pedantic, &quot;classic&quot; Romanticism, as if totally clean of it's inherent excesses and unbalance.<br /><br /> The funny - or revelatory - thing about this record is to find so un-Brahmsian and hyper-romantic conductor as Bernstein needing to publicly save his &quot;integrity with Brahms&quot;. But just listen to Bernstein's overbloated and awfully self-indulgent late Brahms recordings (especially his just-as-slow interpretation of Brahms 1st. piano concerto) and you will miss Gould's truer integrity as wonderfully shown by this document.<br /><br /> Now, if only Gould would have recorded some Chopin ...
B00005NTJK|5.0|Benefit was of course, the precursor to Aqualung, and points to the direction of that album. Most people tend to think Stand Up was Tull's best pre-Aqualung album, but for me I think it's Benefit. It's a more mature offering, not to mention it has a darker tone. The blues of previous albums (like &quot;A New Day Yesterday&quot; and &quot;A Song For Jeffrey&quot;) had pretty much vanished. In the US, this album featured &quot;Teacher&quot;, a song that became an FM radio favorite. Over in the UK, it wasn't featured on the album (it was released as a single with &quot;Witches Promise&quot;), and instead featured &quot;Alive and Well and Living In&quot; (which luckily for us Americans we got to hear on the Living in the Past compilation album). This album featured the premiere of John Evan on organ and piano, but he wasn't quite a full-time member yet. Anderson's flute playing is only featured on five of the album's ten songs, but regardless the album is still full of great songs. &quot;With You To Help Me&quot; features some nice use of flute (that sounds like it was recorded backwards). You get to hear Evan's use of piano. Martin Barre rocks out in places. &quot;Nothing to Say&quot; shows how great a Tull song can be even when the flute isn't present. &quot;Alive and Well and Living In&quot; (not on the US release) is mainly a piano-dominated piece. The US version features in its place &quot;Inside&quot; (which the UK version uses this song in place of &quot;Teacher&quot; on side two). A nice catchy, almost singalong piece, with nice use of flute. &quot;With Michael Collins, Jeffery and Me&quot; is a song that most resembles one of the acoustic interludes found on their following album, Aqualung. I just love how this song alternates between mellow and acoustic to rocking. &quot;To Cry You a Song&quot; is basically Martin Barre's time to shine, as it's completely guitar dominated with only Anderson providing the vocals. &quot;Play in Time&quot; is a strange piece, with Anderson's flute and John Evan's piano (with the tape played in reverse). &quot;Sossity, You're a Woman&quot; is a completely acoustic piece. I felt this piece was a bit underrated, because I actually find it an excellent piece. This was Tull's last album with Glenn Cornick, as he would move on to a group called Wild Turkey (which featured Ritchie Blackmore's brother Jon Blackmore, future Rick Wakeman vocalist Garry Pickford-Hopkins, and members of the Welsh band Man, Jeff Jones and &quot;Tweke&quot; Lewis). Unfortunately Benefit don't get the attention their next two albums would get (Aqualung, Thick as a Brick), but I actually felt this to be better than Aqualung. Might not be as easy to get in to as Stand Up, but a great album still the same.
B00006FDCJ|5.0|An aged gunman, William Munny (Clint Eastwood), is offered a job by The Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett). Munny is to assist this young gunslinger in killing a couple of men, with bounties on their heads, for beating a hooker. Munny reluctantly accepts the job, desperately in need of cash. He and The Schofield Kid are joined by Munny's old partner (Morgan Freemen) as they set out on their journey. The only thing that stands in there way is the sinister sheriff (Gene Hackman) of a small town <br /> <br />Unforgiven is a unique western in that where most westerns glorify violence and bloodshed, Unforgiven examines the psychological effects of violence, the finality of murder, and the fragility of life. One death, in particular, is drawn out and made quite unpleasant without being gratuitous. The film is meticulously paced, which allows the viewer to think and reflect on how easily violent acts can be committed and the impact they have on the perpetrator and those close to the victims. Munny is haunted by the ghosts of those he has killed. Having committed the act of murder, The Schofield Kid is horrified and disgusted with himself. Gunslinging isn't what it's cracked up to be. <br /> <br />David Webb Peoples's original screenplay allows the film's characters to develop and break free of their western clichs. Eastwood's character represents a deconstruction of his famed tough guy career. Eastwood sheds his \\"Dirty Harry\\" persona to play a man who has grown weary and regretful of the crimes and the murders he committed in his past. Jaimz Woolvett plays The Schofield Kid, a character who - on the surface - appears to be the formulaic cocky gunslinger; but is actually a richly developed character with many unseen truths. Gene Hackman, Morgan Freemen, and Richard Harris round out the superb cast.  <br /> <br />Unforgiven's impeccable period detail greatly adds to the film's realism. The lack of vibrancy in the film's color palette and the heavy use of shadows greatly contribute to the state of the dismal characters and the heaviness of the subject matter. <br /> <br />Unforgiven is very much unlike Sergio Leone's bold and operatic westerns, which are wonderful films in their own right. Superfluous gun fights are not to be found here. It is a gritty western steeped in reality.
B00008YZYM|4.0|The story has been told in other reviews, but I just wanted to share my little personal experience: <br />As a mom I'm happy my daughter has found such an charming and innocent movie she loves, starring the (at that time) adorable Lindsay Lohan. Of course the story isn't exactly realistic (not many of us have heard of divorced couples who wouldn't really remember why they got divorced or have seen divorced parents getting back together). But still, or maybe because of that, it's a sweet story. I think there should be more of this kind of movies instead of those showing too much bare skin and kids pretending to be grownups.  <br />As for the target audience, preteens it is. We've had sleep overs with girls watching it, my daughter watches it alone and even I can stand staying in the same room.
B000096IBI|5.0|MODERN TIMES opens with its credits being printed out over a close-up image of a clock ticking interminably forward. The film's first real shot is of mindless sheep being herded through gates, which fades into an image of factory employees exiting a subway stop on their way to work. Looking at this from a modern standpoint, one can only think that the more things change, the more they stay the same.      This is a film that I can watch over and over again. It's not just that it's an incredibly funny film. It's not just that its satire of modernization and industrialization still rings true today. It's that each aspect of the filmmaking pulls together to form something greater than each individual part. The story ranges from big topics concerning the Great Depression and dehumanization, while successfully balancing that with the small love story between the tramp and the gamin. In a theme that would be revisited even more powerfully in LIMELIGHT, the two characters need each other, depend on each other and simply have no reason to exist without the other. The comedy tickles while the tragedy touches. No other director in film history managed to find that equilibrium with such skill.       This is rightly hailed as the last great silent movie, albeit one made several years after sound has become the norm. I still get a kick out of the fact that the only intelligible voices come solely from machines. Chaplin is making a silent film using sound technology, meaning he has the option to take the best of the both worlds. His next film, THE GREAT DICTATOR, wouldn't quite get this mixture right, but it's a success here. The film can go for several minutes at a time with no meaningful talking or sound effects, and then suddenly jump into an unexpected gag involving voice. The mixture of sound and silent set pieces was inevitable at this point in film history, but I've never seen it pulled off as well as Chaplin does it here.      While disc one contains the film itself in beautifully restored condition, the second DVD is full of extras. Most important is the &quot;Chaplin Today -- Modern Times&quot; documentary. This is more or less structured around two French directors (Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne) discussing the film. Absolutely fascinating stuff. They analyze the film's jokes, its metaphors and its themes. They talk about everything from the number of frames per second shot to the number of gags that revolve around food. Also included in the documentary is some footage of Chaplin meeting Gandhi. I have nothing to add; I just had to mention it.      Chaplin's nonsense song, the tune he sings at the end of the film in faux Italian, is the subject of two extras. The first is an extended version, featuring a final verse that never made it to the final edit. The second is a Karaoke version of the song (I'm not making this up). And speaking of Chaplin's music, there's an excerpt from 1950s TV of Liberace himself (of all people) performing &quot;Smile&quot; -- the theme from MODERN TIMES. Great rendition of a great song.       There's also a short (ten minute) documentary from 1967 called &quot;Por primera vez&quot; (&quot;For The First Time&quot;) in which peasants in a tiny village in Cuba are shown a movie for the first time. It's a fascinating look at what film means to people who have never actually watched one before. The reason for its inclusion on this DVD is that the film in question is, of course, MODERN TIMES. It may be an odd choice for their first film experience given that the story of a factory worker undergoing a nervous breakdown may not be something that relates well to people who rarely even see automobiles. But the villagers laugh at the right places and seem genuinely enthused. The documentary is well worth watching and will fascinate anyone with an interest in the societal ramifications of film.      The picture restoration on the main feature is also fabulous. The image has never looked crisper. While this is nominally a silent movie, the original release did feature a synchronized soundtrack of sound effects and Chaplin's musical score (which means, unlike other &quot;silent&quot; DVD releases, we connoisseurs don't have to argue about whether this particular sound track is wonderful and totally keeping in the spirit of what would have been played at the time, or a complete outrage that should result in everyone responsible being shot). The sound quality is excellent, bringing one of my favorite film soundtracks to life superbly.      If I was going to recommend one Chaplin movie to someone, I think I'd have to choose this one. It has two major things going for it. It's a great film, but it's also extremely representative of his body of work. It has comedy, it has pathos, it features the tramp, it has a message. And it's also one of the most influential movies that Chaplin ever made. Everyone, from film to television (remember Lucille Ball working at the candy factory?), has either made reference to MODERN TIMES, or just plain stolen some of its gags. The image of Charlie being dragged into the heart of the gears and cogs of a giant unfathomable machine is familiar to even those people who haven't seen the movie. If you like this film, then you should already own this release. And if you haven't seen it before, then this is absolutely worth a gander. You'll be surprised at just how modern and fresh this classic movie is.
0156027321|4.0|Martel's style is very pleasant to read. He's quite gentle and courteous - even in describing some awful deprivations. You get the feel of being with the gentle and courteous Pi. In the early chapters in the book we are able to enjoy not only his company, but also his recollections of his often idyllic upbringing on his family's business zoo as he came to delight in not only Hinduism, but in Christianity and Islam as well. The voice moves smoothly between narration and oration, with Pi weaving in thought-provoking and wonderfully articulate portions of his perhaps unfashionable personal philosophy.<br /><br />Then the book veers into the extended narrative (or parable?) of Pi's utterly torturous and fabulous ordeal surviving for months at sea in a lifeboat also occupied by a massive Bengal tiger! There's not so much philosophy here - rather it becomes an adventure/survival book, describing, often in some detail, exactly how someone might get through such an extreme situation. It's an impressive feat of imagination - to carry your readers through more than half a book where there is only one setting and one character. And it gets difficult at times: please, Martel, will you let this awful story end and save Pi (and us!). Remember, though, Martel is always thoughtful: before anything turns nasty we already have been reassured, in the most endearing of domestic settings, that `this story has a happy ending'. Part of me is tempted to lend the book to a friend who loves these sort of survival against all odds stories - but I have a feeling he'd feel ripped off that it was fiction, no matter how convincing it sounded. Whatever, it's a gripping and gruelling story.<br /><br />I imagine he got a Booker because a lot of readers, unlike me, felt the conclusion wonderfully tied together the earlier syncretic musings and the incredible tale. However while I think I worked it out, the climax hardly leapt out and slapped me in the face (which is something I really like a novel to do). The crucial lesson comes when insurance men are asked to choose between two stories: an inspiring and unbelievable one with a tiger, and more believable ugly one:<br /><br />\\"I know what you want. You want a story that won't surprise you. That will confirm what you already know. That won't make you see higher or further or differently. You want a flat story. An immobile story. You want dry, yeastless factuality.\\"<br /><br />\\"Uhh...\\"<br /><br />\\"You want a story without animals.\\"<br /><br />\\"Yes!\\"<br /><br />But, of course, that is foolish: there are animals, and they are incredible - it's lying to yourself to blind your eyes to the fantastic. `Incredible' is an excellent word here: a Bengal tiger is utterly `credible' - we know they exist - but at the same time on an emotional/spiritual level ... incredible. Perhaps Martel is challenging the pedestrian world view that, indefensibly, cowardly, denies awe - that doesn't want to admit to the abundant and undeniable spirituality/beauty/truth of, dammit, animals (and people and trees and stars and music and life and the rest of it).<br /><br />In a sense for Martel the vibe, man, is everything. If you can pick it up in a mosque, at a zoo, catching a wave, in the eyes of a child, taking the mass, reading a scripture (any scripture), staring down a microscope ... grab it. Relish it. Flee the `dry, yeastless factuality' of agnostic life, and joyfully claim, `the better story':<br /><br />Words of divine consciousness: moral exaltation; lasting feelings of elevation, elation, joy; a quickening of the moral sense, which strikes one as more important than an intellectual understanding of things; an alignment of the universe along moral lines, not intellectual ones; a realisation that the founding principal of existence is what we call love, which works itself out sometimes not clearly, not cleanly, not immediately, nonetheless ineluctably.<br /><br />At times I've held onto this sort of thing: when some of Jesus' words really sting and you just know they're good - what other grounds do you want? What other grounds will you ultimately get anyway? It's like Keirkegaard's refusal to be an intellectual spectator: for truth to mean anything worthwhile for a human it must touch more than mind - it must be embraced by the whole person. It relates to A'Kempis', \\"I should much rather feel compunction than be able to define it.\\" To Berdyaev's, \\"God is that which cannot be expressed.\\"<br /><br />Yet while Pi is presented as having deep religious convictions, ultimately he holds a staggeringly condescending view of Islam, Hinduism and Christianity (and atheism for that matter). The three straw-men clergy of these faiths are given comic lines when they finally meet - more like the three stooges than three wise men - and laughably blind to their overwhelming similarities outweighing their differences. Ha ha, if only they could overcome their trivial differences ... this really is ugly disrespect. And ignorant - which surprises me in one as well versed as Martel clearly is. Surely he has picked that his blithe mouthing of the absurd populism - that all religions are essentially the same - flies in the face of their core convictions and defining qualities. This book mixes inspired insight with insulting (but ably disguised) stupidity. For all his attacks on agnosticism, he counts as a virtue his refusal to actually take the leap to any particular faith despite crucial ultimately either/or decisions with massively differing lifeshaping (and after-lifeshaping) effects. He doesn't even offer the notion of respecting the integrity of someone with undeniably differing beliefs: no, we're all just trying to `love God' - we really have the same beliefs (what nonsense!).<br /><br />There are some wonderful sound bites in the book, and some eminently quotable and telling passages for people on all sides of the theological fence. It's very readable, often gripping and enjoyable. Even the objections I've raised come more from stepping back from the book or rereading parts - while on the journey Martel is wonderfully (even deceptively) palatable.

B00005JN2F|2.0|To see the bourne identity (2002) is to enjoy it. but to see the Bourne supremacy is to absolutely cherish the bourne identity. coming out of the first film the veiwer had a slight impression that something special had just happened. if nothing else you let out a sigh of relief that a summer action movie passed before your eyes and didn't feel like two hours worth of temporal larsony. <br /> but once the bourne supremacy has finshed shaking, draining, shouting and crashing, it becomes clear; the bourne identity had its brains and its bals all in the right place. <br /> doug liman, who directed the first film, knew that bourne was a cerebral presence. he knew that his strengths were not only what he did but the fact that he saw what needed to be done. his camera was patient and steadily mirrored jason bourne insight for insight. even with that knowledge that movie never lost track of the action element. this steady cerebral camera zipped along from crisis to crisis and in the hands of an assured film maker we became assured in the hands of our protagonist. <br /> now for bourne supremacy; in this movie bourne is a robot. the point of the dramatic device of bourne is that he is trying to overcome the fact of his being a programmed husk. but supremacy never lets him past it. he wakes up with a headache that makes him tense. things happen that make him angry and from there on he is just a bundle of reactions. from moment to moment he might as well be a walking talking copy of the script. he is all stage directions and punctuation, blowing stuff up where it needs to be blown up. <br /> now to my main complaint, from which i am still recovering physically. Paul Greengrass' all shaking, all shifting, never focusing, never resting camera. to say his action scenes are over active is like saying that micheal moore might have an opinion or two about george bush. as soon as the scene is set and a typed title lets us know where we are, the cameras are strapped onto the backs ofa herd of fidgety five year olds and the scene is constructed from the higgledy-piggledy that results. lets see if we cant agree on at least a couple of things; a fast handheld zoom-in on a chracter may be dramatic and may work to let the audience know, &quot;keep your eye on this one.&quot; but zooming in three times on three different characters (a total of nine) in under thirty seconds (possibly an exageration but not by much) serves no purpose but to make the veiwer feel like the story has been abandoned and replaced by a coked-up advertisement for cosmetics. second, its not fair to assume that a chracter has all the humanity he needs left over from a previous outing. this picture gives jason bourne nothing human to feel, do, or say. the film seems completely concious that the only reason we are there is beacuse we saw the first one and it seems to trust that the connections will hold. some will say that bourne's next to last act in the movie is all we need, to see him as human. but thats at the end. it is reseting him as a person for part three. ineffectively i might add. the only way for him to redeem himself after that many killings and car crashes is to offer himself as a sacrifice to the emotional health of his victims. instead he finds closure that he didnt earn as a human. robots dont get redeemable coupons for human depth.  <br /> i understand that it probably isnt fair to compare kids to their older syblings and i am likely performing a terrible injustice, judging the bourne supremacy on the template of its predacessor. but the truth is it is a bad movie, hard to watch and unrewarding. it just so happens that the bourne identity got the formula right and the best way to know what went wrong is to know how it can go right.  <br />

George told you nearly 10 years ago that you wouldn't see the original trilogy on dvd ever. so get over it. i think he'd be selling out as an artist if he was releasing the original just to satisfy part of the audience. <br />  <br /> it's gonna be awesome! better sound, better picture, awesome story! how can you go wrong? even old emperor monkey-eyes will be gone!

B0000844MV|4.0|I dug it.  There pre-deployment party was the best scene. I've actually been to parties like that! I will have to say, when I first saw the move (in the theator) that scene alone, signaled that this movie was going to be good, no Hollywood junk but a good rendition of a U-boat in WWII, under hard conditions.  It portrayed the circumstances very acurately.  I've been on quite a few older ships, sailing around the western pacific, so the life-at-sea conditions were well done.  The director went to painstaking detail in bringing us an excellent rendition of the times.  Bravo!
0380002930|4.0|Entertaining and light reading.  Was skeptical of bunnies at first but caved after prodding from my sister.  Plus I figured after balrogs, evles, and all powerful rings I could give this a shot.  Finished easily in an afternoon, and I would recommend skipping over the detailed nature sections to streamline a little.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|Follow Through: Very different from the studio version. Really good to listen to. <br />Chariot: The mostly piano-sounding track makes this track really fresh. <br />Just Friends: Gavin's piano playing in this track makes this song seem very fresh. <br />Nice To Meet You Anyway: Just as potent as the original version. <br />Chemical Party: Gavin goes concert-style on this one, adding Alvin's voice on background. <br />Belief: I generally skip this track on the studio version the moment Gavin utters the first word. I still do in the Stripped version, but the first word comes in seconds later this time.  <br />Crush: Good track. Very similar to its original counterpart. <br />I Don't Want To Be: The first two chords that Gavin plays on his piano automatically makes me think of some Chinese Kung Fu film. But it's just as great as its original counterpart. <br />Meaning: Sounds a bit like the original version. Still a good listen. <br />More Than Anyone: Gavin breaks out the high-pitchedness in his vocals for this track. You must listen to this track! <br />Change is Gonna Come (Sam Cooke classic): Beautiful. Just beautiful. <br />
B00009V8Z9|5.0|gavin degraw's CD Chariot is by far my favorite CD in my collection. unlike many other artists he has a true talent for singing and playing the piano. the only thing better than gavin's voice and the music of his songs are the lyrics behind every song he sings. with Chariot Stripped, the acoustic and live version of his previous CD, Chariot, is just as good as the studio recorded album. the relaxing sounds of chariot stripped will touch anyone who listens and i strongly suggest you buy this cd!!!
B000244EMO|5.0|I'd love to take you up on that bet about this being the only movie w/ 2 future Governors in it.  Ahnuld and Jesse 'The Body' co-starred in 'The Running Man' also. Now if I only knew what the stakes were in the bet. <br /> <br />As for the movie itself, I love 'Predator' and think it is one of Ahnuld's best movies. As far as this DVD goes since it's not out I haven't seen it but, IGN has a good review of it up on their website. <br /> <br />Oh if anyone finds out what the stakes were for the bet be sure and let me know.
0790731479|5.0|Ok I was never a big fan of Michael Keaton until they brought out this movie.  He is absolutely brilliant in this along with the other stars in this ghostly comedy. Very strange in parts but that adds to our own unknow thinking of what actually happens when we die.  Great music that you can sing a long to. So go out and buy this movie, you won't be disappointed!
B000294SFW|5.0|After buying a copy of this &quot;raging&quot; slab of Rock n' Roll, I felt compelled to write my first review in several months. &quot;Inferno&quot; definitely deserves the 5 stars which have been unanimously given to it by ALL of it's reviewers thus far. When I first noticed that Motorhead had a new cd out last week, I thought well it's about that time again. Since 1991's &quot;1916&quot; cd, they have not gone more than 2 years without a studio release. And just like always, I stumble upon the latest &quot;Motor-chapter&quot; without ever knowing it existed! Anyway, &quot;Inferno&quot; might possibly be the best Motor-release in almost a decade. This was my thought as I was halfway through it, blasting it into the airwaves out of my car! By the end of the cd, I could almost confidenly argue it to be the best Motorhead since 1980's &quot;Ace of Spades!&quot; I know this might seem a little over the top, with such a hefty catalogue between these two over the past 1/4 century. I seriously haven't heard these guys so fresh, yet determinedly ass-kicking in years. Even the most dedicated Motor-fan will admit that they never stray far from their winning formula; leaving each album sounding like a sequel in a neverending, ear-blistering &quot;Born to lose, Live to win&quot; Motorworld. Their last several albums in particular all sound somawhat interchangeable. This is not necessarily a bad thing, just part consistent and part redundant. &quot;Inferno&quot;, however seems to breathe new fire into the listener's ears, while grabbing them by the balls for 49 minutes without letting go! You can trust me, I've been a true Motorfan since 1992. I first saw them on the Headbanger's Ball with their legendary &quot;Ace of Spades&quot; video. Then I remember the videos from &quot;March Or Die&quot;, and I was forever hooked. It wasn't until 2003 that I was officially Motorized when I saw them play at The Agora in Cleveland. I remember being completely awestruck when Lemmy finallytook the stage. Concert-goers were relentessly yelling &quot;MOTORHEAD&quot; all evening, even durig Anthrax's set! When they came on, they cranked the volume levels into the stratosphere, leaving me partially deaf for a couple of days! Some bands play music on stage. Motorhead &quot;kicks your ass!&quot; Lemmy is forever a larger than life Rock n' Roll icon who was never about compromising. Through all of it's lineups and record label changes, Lemmy has kept Motorhead a vital constant force always to be reckoned with. With &quot;Inferno&quot;, you can almost visualize hearing &quot;a crowning achievement&quot; topping off Motorhead's first 30 years of &quot;Overkill&quot; with an &quot;Iron Fist.&quot; And as long as the planet keeps turning on it's axis, I can't imagine Lemmy and co. giving up dishing out Motoreadaches any time soon. Long Live Lemmy, Long Live Motorhead, and Long Live &quot;Real&quot; Rock n&quot; Roll!!!
B00008EY65|4.0|I watched Hellboy in a theater, I rated it 5 stars (feel free to read my review on Hellboy theatrical release). Hellboy is a beautiful story with action-packed, romantic, and sensational elements. Let's cut it short and target to the DVD features rating here. One word --- GREAT!<br /><br />  Besides the standard DVD features such as deleted scenes, director commentary, trailers, and storyboard, this DVD also comes with lots of essential information to answer all your puzzling questions and curiosity of each major characters like Helloboy himself, Liz, Abe, Rasputin, and Kroenen. Even more, it educates you some extras details like the big gun Hellboy using, which is given by Dr. Broom in his 18th birthday, and the crucifix always with Hellboy, which is once belonged to Jesuit Priest Luis Navarro who personally destroyed 113 vampires on August 5th, 1709, in La Oroya, Peru. You can also find background stories for each major characters, and some side stories like why Liz likes taking photo everywhere.<br /><br />  Great information but the deleted scenes seem abit too short, only 3 deleted scenes and they're not essential to the film and story. Overall, it is a great movie with lots of freebies features. If you are the Hellboy comic fans, I believe you already own a copy. Or shouldn't you?<br /><br />  *** Otto Yuen's DVD Special Rating for Hellboy ***<br />  1. Film Rewatchability: MEDIUM-LOW<br />  2. DVD Featurability: VERY STRONG<br />  3. Picture Quality: EXCELLENT<br />  4. Sound Quality: EXCELLENT<br /><br />  (Reviewed by Otto Yuen, 31-Jul-2004)
0062515675|4.0|If you are angry at the world, this book is not meant for you. Don't read it.  If you believe that your life is well organised and running smoothly, you don't need this book. <br /> <br />If you are at a point in your life where you are looking for alternative views, Monk provides a good read. The approach could well be based on buddist philosophy, but the practical tips are not really buddist, but rather good common sense. Considering the breadth of life-organising tips presented in the book, the story line actually brings it all together in a fun read. Sure, some of the lines are rather trite, but the energy of the book carries one through the weak spots. If all these practical tips and techniques were presented in a factual format, the book would be much harder, and boring to read.  <br /> <br />If you want a text book, go buy a text book.  If you have a few hours and are willing to play along with the story, expect to be surprised how the blatantly trite story line can actually lead to a strange sense of well being and satisfaction.  Don't discard the contents for its presentation, you might miss the essential message! <br /> <br />If you are arrogantly ignorant, don't bother. <br />If you have a gentle and exploring nature, try Monk, and enjoy it for what it is: an inspiring fun read! <br /> <br />
B00020X88O|5.0|Hello all, the time has come to once again celebrate the tackiest, the campiest, the most flat-out laughably bad movie of the last 20 years with the release of the Showgirls VIP Special Editon box set. I got the set the day it came out and I'm thrilled with it. Showgirls is one of my favorite movies of all time, and the box does it justice. The commentary by David Schmader is laugh out loud funny, and the drinking games are cool too. Thank you MGM for giving Showgirls aficionados the set we've been lusting after for the past few years. The DVD also includes some behind the scenes footage of Paul Verhoven's \\"direction\\" and Elizabeth Berkley's \\"acting\\", and it is funnier than any comedy you'll see this year. One minor gripe is that it would have been entertaining to listen to a long-winded, self indulgent Verhoven commentary on how this movie is a \\"reflection on the price of fame\\" or some other pretentious crap, but I guess MGM couldn't get him to do one. At any rate, for bad movie lovers or Showgirls fans, this set is a must have, I hope you all enjoy it as much as I have (and will... over and over again).(...)

B00006L83N|5.0|Symphony X: a neo-classical progressive metal band from the USA with amazing talent. Although this was not the first album I purchased by them, many times I walked past it in record stores thinking to myself &quot;Wow, that artwork is incredible...I wonder if the music lives up to it?\\" It was a little pricey, so for over a year I put it on my &quot;CD's to buy in the future&quot; list.  <br />  <br /> I decided to start with Symphony X's earlier work, and purchased &quot;The Divine Wings of Tragedy&quot;. I was extremely happy with it, and next I purchased &quot;Twilight in Olympus&quot;. I was also happy with this album, although Divine Wings was a little better.  <br />  <br /> After a while I finally decided to give The Odyssey a chance. My expectations weren't too high...I didn't think Symphony X could surpass Divine Wings. But anyway, I went to my local record store and bought The Odyssey. <br />  <br /> Little did I know that this was going to be one of the best albums I've ever heard. I should have bought it as soon as I saw it, because I think it's worth every penny.  <br />  <br /> The album is composed of eight tracks (I have the regular version). It is not a concept album. The first 7 songs are still great, and prepare you for what's coming at the end.  <br />  <br /> With that said, here is my song-by-song breakdown of The Odyssey.  <br />  <br /> 1.) Inferno (Unleash the Fire) - Amazing opening riff by guitar wizard Michael Romeo. A great way to start off this album. If you have any of Symphony X's earlier albums, you will soon realize that The Odyssey is their heaviest work yet. This is not necessarily a bad thing at all, as the heaviness adds to the emotion of the songs. Russell Allen's voice sounds very mean and powerful on this track. The chorus is very strong and catchy. As always, Michael Romeo delivers a great guitar solo, followed by a great keyboard solo by Michael Pinnella. All in all, great opener. <br />  <br /> 2.) Wicked - From the intro riff, you may be asking yourself whether or not you are listening to Pantera. This is one of Symphony X's heavier tracks, and it shows. The verses are nice and heavy, and build up to a great chorus. Yet another song that I found stuck in my head. I love the way the guitar solo comes screaming in. Following that, of course, comes another great keyboard solo. I like Russell Allen's short vocal solo here.  <br />  <br /> 3.) Incantations Of The Apprentice - Symphony X serves up another heavy slab of metal here, and Jason Rullo's pounding drums are a standout. For the chorus, the song slows down a bit, with vocal harmonies adding to the dark mood. Nice song.  <br />  <br /> 4.) Accolade II - If you are familiar with &quot;The Accolade&quot; from The Divine Wings of Tragedy, you will find that this is a sequel to the original. It begins with a slow violin sounding intro, building into some heavy riffs. The story speaks of swords, battles, and legends. Symphony X have always been a very mythological band, and it shows here. They somehow manage to avoid the typical cliches of most metal bands that sing about medieval topics. Listen to this song and you'll know what I mean. The chorus is strong; I have a feeling it will be playing in your head uncontrollably. Romeo of course delivers an amazing solo, as expected. This song definitely lives up to the original Accolade.  <br />  <br /> 5.) King Of Terrors - If you read the booklet, you will see an excerpt from Edgar Allan Poe's &quot;The Pit and the Pendulum&quot;. This is an exceptionally heavy track, and the story of course relates to Poe's work. Allen's voice sounds very malicious here. Not the catchiest song on the album, but definitely a good one. Nice solos.  <br />  <br /> 6.) The Turning - One of my favorite tracks here, this song is both fast and heavy. Rullo delivers great double bass and the riffs are great. The chorus is incredibly infectious. Russell Allen sounds extremely mean on this track. I think he growls meaner on this track than any other Symphony X song. Anyway it's a great song, with nice solos.  <br />  <br /> 7.) Awakenings - This is a rather lengthy song, clocking in at over 8 minutes. Awakenings features very slow moments, also with heavy ones. The solos are nothing short of incredible, and the music and vocals are very tight. This is the last song before the title track, so when listening, prepare yourself.  <br />  <br /> 8.) The Odyssey - This is it. The 24-minute monster of a song - The Odyssey. Based of course on Homer's famous book, the story focuses mainly on the journey back to Ithaca, when the kingdom is found in jeopardy. This song flows with emotion, beginning with the incredible overture. It is truly unlike anything I've ever heard. Everything here is top notch, musically and vocally. The song is divided into seven parts. Believe me when I say there isn't a boring moment of this song. It can be both extremely heavy and very soft, so you will be thrown on a roller coaster of a musical journey. You can feel the emotion when Allen sings &quot;Home, I'm dreaming of home...&quot; in Part II of the song. The vocal harmonies enlighten the song very much. After that, the song gets very heavy. There are many changes in this song, all which add to the listening experience. I will wrap this up, as nothing I can write will truly do this song justice. The ending is absolutely amazing, when the chorus &quot;Triumphant champion of Ithaca!&quot; hits you. It is one of the most euphoric choruses I've ever heard. Reliable Romeo serves up incredible guitar solos, Pinnella plays amazing keyboards, Rullo provides amazing drums, Michael Lepond pulls off great bass lines, and Russell Allen sings his heart out.  <br />  <br /> The title track alone is worth the price of this album, so I would recommend it to anyone who likes good music. This is Symphony X's greatest achievement thus far, and it will be amazing if they manage to surpass it. There is no filler on this album,nor is there filler on any Symphony X album. They really seem to put a great amount of effort into their music, and it really shows.  <br />  <br /> I own all of Symphony X's albums except their debut. I love all of them, including V: The New Mythology Suite, which I haven't mentioned yet. It is a full-blown concept album, and a great one at that.  <br />  <br /> If you are a fan of rock, progressive music, heavy metal, or even classical music, I strongly urge you to pick up The Odyssey. I hope you like it as much as I do. <br />
B0002234LS|3.0|This movie is mildly entertaining. All the elements of a thriller are there. It's Stephen King fair and for some reasons his good thriller writing hasn't always translated consistently to good films. Sure some of them have been the scariest stories to hit the theaters, but others have been real duds. &quot;Secret Window,&quot; falls somewhere between the two. What holds it back is...there's nothing really new here. Take &quot;Dolores Claiborne,&quot; and cross it with &quot;The Shining,&quot; and well...you've got &quot;Secret Window.&quot;<br /><br /> Depp puts in an interesting performance (as he most always does)as the central character, a writer that is remote cabin bound while his life is falling apart. John Turturro's character is played with significant quirk, however his homespun backwoods down home &quot;Deliverance&quot; style comes across as one-dimensional and ultimately not believable and worst of all not really frightening. The story line has a few intended surprises but the movie seems to telegraph them.<br /><br /> When all is said and done, you will find yourself getting deja vu...you've been here before, you've watched bits and pieces of this movie in other movies. Watching &quot;Secret Window,&quot; certainly isn't a waste of time but there's better fare to be had.<br /><br /> --MMW
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Definitely a great movie and one of my personal favorites, Love Actually, brings to the screen a set of stories that take place in London, England, involving an unlikely group of people who are linked to each other in varying ways.  The list of top quality actors taking part in this film is very long!  All the actors' performances are outstanding; their great talent and chemistry clearly shows, thus providing a film that can be watched over and over again.   <br />The plot is very witty, very well thought through, and fantastically executed. <br />But that is not the only thing that puts this movie at the very top; it combines excellent comedy, realistic drama (for a change), and the music is such an asset (!!!), making this movie one of the best of its kind. <br />After Notting Hill and Four Weddings and a Funeral, Richard Curtis has scored another major hit with this movie! In short, Love Actually is a movie guaranteed to make you both laugh and cry, and in the end leave you with the warmest feelings of joy!  I for one would definitely line up to watch a sequel! <br />
B0000DJZAH|5.0|This is one of the best redone classic rock cd's around!  If you are a Who fan, get this one instead of hte less expensive remastered version.  This one has a whole extra disc of out-takes and demo recordings that includes Pete doing vocals on some songs that Roger sings on original.  It has a great bit with John, Keith and Pete talking and Keith laughing hysterically- it is WELL WORTH THE EXTRA MONEY!!!!!
B0000C6K09|5.0|I have been fascinated by the few modern composers of &quot;my&quot; time, John Williams, Barry, Silvestri, Horner, and Goldsmith. As I look at my collection of soundtracks, (old records to CDs) simply for the love of the music, I find that I have collected more John Williams music over the years than all others. <br />  <br /> What's even more fascinating is that I can listen to the music and pick up on key signatures. I could tell you almost immediately if it was Williams, Barry or Goldsmith. <br />  <br /> I'm in awe of all of them. I truly appreciate their work, as much as I appreciate those who have gone before them. <br />  <br /> This is a wonderful compilation. A must have for any John Williams fan. <br />  <br /> Karen L Bellmont <br />
0802130208|5.0|ignatious is truly disgusting, pontificating, and many other words end in 'ing'. having said that i thoroughly enjoyed this book. toole certainly put together a rare page turner. you can't help but wonder what other stories he would have been able to tell had he not killed himself. he also wrote &quot;neon bible&quot;, but do not think for a moment that it is anything like this one.<br /><br /> ignatious is quite unigue. a definitely singular character who views the world rather like don quixote, but without the chivalry. his adventures are madcap and hilarious. you find yourself turning the pages wanting to find out what he will say or do next just as i did. thank you michael, for lending me your copy! i now have my own!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Ya know people either love or hate this album.....it's a great album..I think the biggest mistake people make is when they compare it to Mer de Noms....OKKKK look they don't sound alike....weren't supposed to...MJK wanted to changed the music written by Billy Howerdel in order to fit a certain concept. You can't listen to this album and expect a Mer de Noms....The first album is more singles oriented in my opinion....this album is one of those that is greater than the some of its parts..the album like they said, takes you through the darker side of the human psyche...because of the lyrical context you can interpret the idea behind the album in different ways...it could be about addiction, relationships, whatever...and the interludes are not filler because they compliment to the concept...jus listen, this album is meant to listen to on headphones too, reminiscent of a Cure album..THIS IS NOT A MER DE NOMS, and not a singles oriented work, jus give it a few listens all the way through and find your own personal meaning to it...
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|Hello! This album is truly a must. The strokes have ,in a way, grown with room on fire by experimenting with new sounds. Songs like \\"Reptilia\\", \\"Under Control\\",\\"I can't win\\"....heck the whole album make you listen and pay attention to every chord that Nikolai, Nick and Albert play , to every beat Fab creates and Julian's not-so-soothing-but-nice-in-a-really-really-good-way voice. I really liked \\"is this it\\" and I'm a huge fan of them...but sometimes....I get annoyed in their songs \\"You talk way too much\\" and \\"The way it is\\"...but other than that, one of the greatest albums.....PICK IT UP NOW!!.
B0001AP12G|4.0|I LOVE what this dude is doing. Hip-hop is not about women, cars, &quot;bling bling&quot;, crime, and money, its about speaking your truths and beleifs, paying respect, and trying to keep the peace- and Kanye does that perfectly.
0671042858|5.0|Wow, man!!!!<br /><br /> I haven't read too many books by SK yet, in fact this was my first. It was no less intriguing than I thought, but rather much more. As always, SK uses different concepts and writing styles to lure us into his crazy mind, and it always works. Here, he even uses his first sentence as the quote he displays before the book starts, which is a little ironic. But it works. &quot;The world had teeth and it could bite you with them anytime it wanted&quot;, etc.<br /><br /> My favorite thing about this book is that King never ever treats the little girl as the 9-year-old she is. He throws her in any element of danger and horror he feels like it, and explains her emotions and sufferings exactly like it would be. Which is the reason he can't sleep at night without a night light, I believe, but it doesn't stop him from publishing books like this one.<br /><br /> By this book I think SK wants to send a message that in this country we give kids too much attention, pamper them too much. In movies that center around small children they are made idols and adults go nuts if they can't &quot;spend enough time with them&quot;, etc. Many those movies, like &quot;Liar Liar&quot;, I find corny for that very reason, and SK does the exact opposite, I believe.<br /><br /> Towards the end he makes you doubt a few times what will happen. He does this using his general reputation as a horror writer, so we know if he wants to, he'll end it as horribly as possible. I won't go any further not to spoil it for anyone, but I was literally cryng at the end, and not ashamed to admit it. The little girl's struggles here, and her courage and spirit really got to me. Stephen King knew what he was doing. The book is not boring at all, even though there's really no action in it. I read it in a couple of days, which is almost a record for me.<br /><br /> So, don't hesitate at all when making the choice for purchase. You can't regret it; not when dealing with SK.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I only had to read a page of reviews to see how this was going to proceed. The &quot;artsy&quot; folk all sing the praises of a wonderful film while the &quot;normal&quot; people ridicule something they obviously didn't relate to or understand. Well I fall in line with the artsy folks. The film was gorgeous, subtle, sad, and uplifting all at the same time. I really related to the characters as I watched them gazing lonely and melancholy at the bizarre new world around them. You could really feel what they were feeling. Their loneliness and longing for someone who could understand was so intense and real you could almost touch it. I think Sofia Coppola did a wonderful job with her sophomore film. The cinematography, acting, and story were all Oscar worthy and I look forward to her next project.      I'm sorry for the people who didn't enjoy this movie. I think it takes a certain type of personality to relate to a movie like this but it's certainly nothing to be bitter about. I've read posts where the people rating the movie as a 1 star personally attack anyone that dares enjoy the film. That's a shame. We all have different tastes and some are more complex (or weird if that makes you happy)than others and there's no need to try and insult someone over a difference in opinion.
B0002GTWYW|5.0|Biggie truly put Puffy on the Map&bad Boy Records make no mistake about it you just feel Biggies pressence&vibe. now aside from a couple of tracks there isn't really anything new to speak of here.but the DVD makes up for matters.it's always to go back&Catch a Hungry Artist on the way up&this truly Highlights one of Music's Best Story-Tellers ever.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|IN THE ZONE, the latest LP (4th) from Britney Spears is definately different! You can no longer categorise Britney as a Pop Princess! Nor can you with Christina or Madonna even... because pop has changed dramatically from when it first appeared big to now! You get war and politics and depression in the news and wherever you go and in alot of albums you get the same but people don't want to be stuck with war and depression everywhere they go... enter Britney Spears! In The Zone is an album that takes you away from reality and catapaults you into the world of entertainment! This is definatley a club album with the solid bass beats on &quot;Breathe On Me&quot; and &quot;(I Got That) Boom Boom&quot; and the fact that every song on the album is catchy, melodic, rythmic and well-structured and not one song on In The Zone is the same as the as the other! IT HAS VARIETY! Reggae, Kylie style techno-dance, Hip-hop, Sexy RnB, Moody bass, Acoustics, Futuristic psycho pop and sensual rythms! This album also clearly carries Britney Spears gracefully into her more mature years with tracks covering: sex, masturbation, hang-overs, love and loss, inspiration and of course PARTYING AND CLUBBING!!! It's what she does best... OK, i admit, she doesn't have the best voice in the world but neither does Madonna and look at her! Britney has got a very unique talent that she uses her voice to the best of her ability to create outstanding, chart-toppings songs which just goes to show that Britney Spears is only one in a billion! In The Zone is a genius album and she should be very proud and I suggest that you buy it, it WILL impress you and WILL NOT let you down! 4/5 stars
B00006LLLN|5.0|I've been a professional musician for 35 years, playing stringed instruments and all styles of music.  As far as I've heard, this is simply the best bluegrass/country/pop ensemble ever - captured at the peak of their performing careers. This CD set is a joy from beginning to end, and will provide you (if you like this musical genre) with hours of emotional listening pleasure.  My hat's off.
B00004YYDI|5.0|The Professional (U.S. Title) is about a lonely mob assassin, Leon, befriending a 12 year-old girl, Mathilda, whose entire family is murdered because her father ripped off drug dealers.  The murders take place just outside Leon's apartment door.  As Mathilda comes back from grocery shopping she sees the carnage and knocks on Leon's door, who reluctantly let's her in and saves her life. The movie portrays a very unique and sweet relationship between Mathilda and Leon.  Mathilda falls in the love (or is it a crush) with the middle-aged loner assassin which has overt sexual overtones.  Leon loves Mathilda too, but more in a big brother or fatherly fashion.  The interplay between the two as Leon reluctantly takes Mathilda under his wing and teaches her to be an assassin is what makes the movie riveting.  Unfortunately, Mathilda's insistence on going after the man who killed her four year-old brother (she didn't have much use for the rest of her family) puts them both in danger.  The ringleader of this crew is an agent for the Drug Enforcement Agency played brilliantly by Gary Oldham.  The screenplay is quite intricate and the acting superb, making it difficult to justice to the movie in a short review.    The uncut version of Leon is far superior to the original movie, although the original is extremely good too.  The extra footage makes the movie a little slower from an action standpoint but is much richer and rewarding.  The uncut version expands on the unique relationship between Leon and Mathilda and gives the viewer a greater understanding and empathy for the characters.     The acting is just simply outstanding, but especially by Natalie Portman playing Mathilda, in what had to be a very demanding role.        The special features on this DVD are nothing.  It's only trailers and actor profiles.  I never buy a DVD for the special features anyway, but it would have been nice to see some interviews of the actors and directors or a \\"The Making Of\\" feature.
0618526412|2.0|What was Oprah thinking recommending this. The story is just as depressing as the picture of the author on the cover. I did not enjoy this at all.
0740745271|4.0|I bought this book shortly after getting Magic Eye II, and I can see how much they've improved their techniques in the intervening years. There are some gorgeous images in this book. I particularly like the butterfly floaters. They've also made it easier to see the images with the help of the two squares at the top of each page, that let you know when you've diverged your eyes just enough. The vision improvement info is another story. Why does Marc Grossman claim you can only do the &quot;palming&quot; exercise for 3 minutes? What terrible thing does he think would happen if you did it longer? (Such as a 1/2 hour, which is how long I routinely do it, without a problem.) Also many of the claims seem over the top. Magic Eye can bring you serenity? Make you more intuitive? Even give you feelings of love? C'mon. Nevertheless, for fans of stereograms, this is well worth adding to your collection.
B000002J1U|4.0|In the cochleas of many, &quot;Led Zeppelin 4&quot; recieves the silver tiara (or in this case, the silver cod-piece) for being Led Zeppelins crowning phallic.And, I am quite content with that.It is a tightly woven unit.But although this album, candidate no.3, isn't as cohesively knit, it is a sentimental favourite of mine.Because, track for track, it is very strong.<br /><br /> This album shows Led Zeppelin to be just as at home with their toothless bumpkinism, as they are with their metalic nutcracking.But, I find the stylistic diversity on this album to stretch a little 'too' coast-to-coast.That's the solitary factor why I deem it my 'sentimental favourite', as opposed to deeming it an 'all-time classic'.eg. &quot;Immigrant Song/Out On The Tiles&quot; ---&gt; &quot;That's The Way/Bron-y-aur Stomp&quot;.The strength of the songs on their own merit? That's why I'd 'not' vehemently contest people calling this an all-time classic.However, a previous reviewer put forth a point that I'm not old enough (sorry mate) to have considered.'On vinyl', all the heavier songs are on one side.And the softies, t'other.That does give an artistic context to this diversity stretch.How great you deem this album, is probably dependant on how much variety within one album you find to be 'just right', vs 'too much'.Aswell as whether or not you actually like acoustic balladic music in general.<br /><br /> &quot;Immigrant Song&quot; is my favourite LZ song (amongst a couple others).Despite it being straight-out rock'n'roll formulaic, it has a masterful exotic hand.&quot;That's The Way&quot; is touching (please don't tell anyone I used that word), especially lyrically.It's nice to see a song about childhood frienship amidst a drug, death, sex-crazed rock world.(Maybe the joke's on me.Maybe it has a meaning that everyone but me knows about).The smooth lead guitar glides beautifully over the equally pleasant acoustic strumming.&quot;Bron-y-aur Stomp&quot; has a well executed sense of humour, in that it's not quite silly enough to not be 'seriously' liked aswell.Those two previous mentionings, along with &quot;Tangerine&quot; and &quot;Gallow's Pole&quot;, are blessings for the genre of acoustic rock.One gets to hear the precision of Jimmy Page's phrasing, and his manipulation of dynamics (something which distortion guitar cannot provide for).I'm so glad that this band delved into this acoustic approach so often in their career.&quot;Since I Been Loving You&quot; is by far my favourite LZ blues song.Perhaps I'm in a minority, but I'm not so partial to their blues tunes.But they perfected their blue veins here.&quot;Hats Off To Harper&quot; is a song best left to a deeply entrenched Zeppelin psyche.I will bravely admit to 'not' liking it, this odd experimental piece.Tho, it is at least, original and creative in purpose.&quot;Friends&quot; is definetely nice enough, tho not one of my personal delicacies.&quot;Out On The Tiles&quot; and &quot;Celebration Day&quot; are excelente, and emblematic of their more classically loved style.<br /><br /> The cover-art?

B00005JN2F|3.0|I rented the Bourne Identity dvd just before watching this movie to refresh my memory about what this movie is about. And I have to say that after watching both movies on the same day, I am still not entirely sure about who Jason Bourne is and what the Treadstone project is all about. <br />    <br />   This sequel managed to get almost the entire cast of the 1st movie back for the 2nd movie. That was cool. The fighting scenes and car chases was very similar in both movies. The directing was identical. So if you've seen the 1st movie, you'll get exactly the same in this movie. I found that this movie lacked a real climax. Just a non-dramatic end to the villian, and then a few loose ends being tied up before the movie ended. Go see it and you'll know what I'm talking about. I particularly liked the performance of Karl Urban (the assassin trying to kill Bourne). But I may be biased being a Xena fan. <br />    <br />   After watching both Bourne movies, I still don't know much about the background of the character. Who he is, where he came from, how he got to this point in the movie. His amnesia is our amnesia. Perhaps that makes for more movies.
0156027321|4.0|I just picked this up and was surprised by how compelling it was. Beautiful, sad, energetic, with welcome flashes of humor but I would never characterize this book as &quot;hilarious&quot;. The ending reminded me of (if memory serves) the last episode of the M*A*S*H TV show in which Hawkeye has two stories about an escape of his own. How badly we want to choose Pi's tiger story.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|Some of these songs should stayed in the vault.  Listen to tracks 1, 4, 7, 10-14, 16 and 18 and you've got a hell of a record.  The rest of the songs suffer from self-conscious attempts to create either mystery or complexity.  Fleetwood Mac was at their best as a pop band.  When they keep it that way they still seem extraordinary.
0780626966|4.0|Way back when boxed sets were scarce and multiple DVDs actually seemed like an expensive endevour, New Line Cinema dropped the Nightmare On Elm Street Series into a great boxed set. These define what a horror collection should be: separate discs for each movie, a bonus disc loaded with crazy amounts of effort for little fun facts and info, and because they could they made Freddy's Dead in 3-D (Paramount, you should be taking notes)! <br />  <br /> I'm not going to get into each movie, what it's about, and my opinion on them, you can check my individual comments for that, I'm merely judging this boxed set edition. <br />  <br /> The first, and at the time this was released, most impressive feature was the cleanup of the video transfer. Anyone who has the original movies on VHS will agree that parts 1, 2, and 3 were grainy and in very poor quality on the VHS transfer. I actually noticed new things watching this version that I missed in the VHS version (nothing plotworthy or anything, but I could notice objects in the dark much better). I also thought the sound was much more crisp, even if it wasn't in 5.1, digital sound does sound much more clear and clean. I also liked the book that accompanied it and I don't think I can stress enough how much I liked seeing Freddy's Dead in 3-D (like it was when I saw it in the theatres!). Many people hated Freddy's Dead and didn't care about the 3-D, and for those people they included the flat 2-D version, which made everyone happy. There were occasional special features on each DVD, nothing too fancy, however the &quot;Jump To A Death&quot; feature is good for late night drinking parties. <br />  <br /> I did give it 4-stars and that's because I'm comparing it to other boxed sets and overall quality. I would have loved to see the movies in 5.1 Dolby or DTS, even though I know they probably didn't have 5.1 until around part 4, the studio could have re-created the track. I also would love to see true special features such as documentaries, deleted scenes, or uncut editions (however since Freddy wasn't as gory, there may not be any). I also would have liked to see the information from the final disc in a different format (it takes a long time to get through!). Again, these are merely comparing them to boxed sets that have come out now, which may not have been out when this set was released. I'm just being almost nitpicky, but it's for accurate comparison with other boxed sets. <br />  <br /> I loved this boxed set, it has been in my collection since jusst after I started collecting DVD's and it's still one of my favorites. Soemtimes I'll wake up on a day off and decide to watch all seven movies strait through, add a case of beer, a few pizzas, and some friends and you've got a great time! If you like the Nightmare series, pick it up, it shows how to do a horror collection/boxed set right!
B00002RAQV|5.0|The story of &quot;Fly Away Home&quot; is fairly predictable, in that we know full well that young Amy Alden (Anna Paquin) is going to persuade her father, Thomas (Jeff Daniels), to come up with a way of teaching a flock of adopted goslings how to fly and get them to a winter refuge in North Carolina. But predictability is not always a deterrent to a film being enjoyable or even inspirational, and you have to pity someone who cannot enjoy watching a bunch of baby geese running after Anna Paquin, convinced that she is there mother and therefore responsible for imprinting on them what they need to learn to survive. Besides, for what is ostensibly a children's film this one opens with a rather shocking scene, where we see a fatal car accident during the open credits while listening to a gentle melody. If there is anything that indicates this is more than your usual predictable children's film, this would be it.<br /><br /> If there is a flaw in &quot;Fly Away Home&quot; it is that the relationship between daughter and father takes a back seat to the story of the geese, so that the pathos that exists there is almost lost in the flapping of wings (but there is a nice moment and a good line when the father tells his daughter why he know what she can do it). They two have been estranged by distance (he returned to Canada while his wife and daughter lived in New Zealand), and living together is not improving things. He is an eccentric artist and inventor who cannot figure out how to connect with a living human being until the geese that come between them bring them together.<br /><br /> Fortunately, dad is spared the role of being the villain, because there are land developers at both ends of the flight and a wild life officer who knows what the rulebook says about domesticated geese. But those are just minor hurdles to the idea of flying 600-miles in four days in an ultra-light plane for Amy to lead her geese to their promised (wet) land. Yes, the idea that the clock is ticking and that bulldozers are ready to roll in North Carolina is all a bit much, but then there are moments, like when the ultra-lights and geese fly through the skyscrapers of Baltimore than just about take your breath away.<br /><br /> I was not aware until after I watched the film that director Carroll Ballard and cinematographer Caleb Deschanel had previously collaborated on &quot;The Black Stallion,&quot; but that certainly makes sense because both films are perfectly willing to let pictures exist without dialogue. The other commonality is that &quot;Fly Away Home&quot; is another film that adults can enjoy just as much as the kiddies.idea that the clock is ticking and that bulldozers are ready to roll in North Carolina is all a bit much, but then there are moments, like when the ultra-lights and geese fly through the skyscrapers of Baltimore than just about take your breath away.  <br />  <br /> I was not aware until after I watched the film that director Carroll Ballard and cinematographer Caleb Deschanel had previously collaborated on &quot;The Black Stallion,&quot; but that certainly makes sense because both films are perfectly willing to let pictures exist without dialogue.

B0001UL7RY|5.0|Let Go had 4 Fantastic trax (Sk8er Boi, Complicated, I'm with U, & losing Grip).. Others were okay. <br /> This one also has 4, well 5 of the greatest songs of the year (the ones that get 10/10), but the others are well, not great, not okay, they are what we call.....GOOOOOOOOOOOD.  <br />  <br /> 1. Take Me Away - This song has power. Avril goes &quot;I am a Woman&quot; in the chorus with her voice. Wish it was longer. (10/10) <br />  <br /> 2. Together - Kinda annoying, well most annoting in the album. Its the chorus again where she goes &quot;TOGETHER&quot; out of nowhere. (6/10) <br />  <br /> 3. Don't tell Me - I don't know how this makes sense but this somehow reminds me of COMPLICATED in the first album. The lyrics are good. The like the place where she goes &quot;did u think i was blblablablabla, this 'TAIEAIEAIEM&quot;. (10/10!) <br />  <br /> 4. He Wasn't - It Felt really good in the beginning, and it also felt good later. just lacks the ORIGINAL thingie. (8/10) <br />  <br /> 5. How does it feel - Soft Song, chorus is good, but the &quot;ah-ah&quot; gets to me. This song has the kind of npower in Take Me Away, but not in the rock and roll thing, but in a soft way. (just compare bring me to life to My Immortal by Evanescence) (8/10) <br />  <br /> 6. MY HAPPY ENDING - Why all in capital? Coz this is the best song in the whole album! Outstanding Opening, Great lyrics, kinda like a story in the video, can't get tired of it!&quot;. Only if I could mark it 15/10...... :( (10/10) <br />  <br /> 7. Nobody's Home - Another GREAT ONE. The tune is terrific, This song just makes you feel Good. One word. &quot;LAVIGNICENT!&quot; (10/10) <br />  <br /> 8. Forgotten - Remember the annoying &quot;ah-ah&quot; in track 5? this also has one in the beginning, and a couple of &quot;yeah-yeah&quot;s, but the beautiful ones. This song will not be forgotten in the hopefully upcoming BEST OF LAVIGNE. (9.75/10) <br />  <br /> 9. Who Knows - The chorus goes with the chorus of he wasn't. Thats what gets to me. Otherwise its really good -0.5 4 dat. (8.5/10) <br />  <br /> 10. Fall to pieces - Reminds me of Don't tell me. It rocks. Nothing else. (9/10) <br />  <br /> 11. Freak out - Catchy openning, ANOTHER ONE OF THE BEST!!! I LOVE THIS SONG, its very &quot;LOSING GRIP-ish&quot;. (10/10)  <br />  <br /> 12. Slipped away - A little less annoying than &quot;Together&quot;, but is is annoying. (7/10)
B00005JLWN|3.0|&quot;Equilibrium&quot; is about a futuristic world in which a totalitarian regime has created a &quot;perfect society&quot; by suppressing emotions and banning ownership of bad things like books, art, and music. If you have a feeling you are guilty of a crime punishable by death. All the citizens take a mood-limiting drug to go along with the constant brain-washing providing by the single media source and keep everybody in place. Then we have the government officials who are charged with destroying those &quot;sense offenders&quot; who resist the rules, one of whom is one of the chief &quot;clerics,&quot; John Preston (Christian Bale).<br /><br /> To anyone who has read Ray Bradbury's classic dystopian novel &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; the plot line of Kurt Wimmer's 2002 film is familiar. But instead of taking the simple idea of banning books to a logical extreme, Wimmer's world goes for absolutely everything. This means that for the first half of &quot;Equilibrium&quot; I was having a hard time finding mine because I could not believe that the world could really get that far. By what logic do you throw out Da Vinci's &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; along with the photographs of Robert Mapplethorpe, that gets rid of both the Sex Pistols and Ludwig von Beethoven, and prohibits everything from snow globes to puppy dogs? Then, on top of everything, you adopt a symbol that is about a close to a swastika as you can get, like this would also be a good thing in a brave new world.<br /><br /> The assumption has always been that it is the conservatives who are going to turn fascist while the liberals are becoming communists, so for the sake of this film we have to believe in a world where conservatives give up religion, forgo any attempts at Vulcan philosophy and take drugs to curb all feelings (Preston is a &quot;cleric&quot; but there are no signs of anything like a religion beyond the cult like obedience to &quot;Father,&quot; this world's version of &quot;Big Brother,&quot; and the tendency to burn people alive as punishment, which may just be another homage to Bradbury). The point is to curb emotions, yet it would the anger of the righteous that would even attempt to spawn this sort of world in the first place. You tell me that Cleric Brandt (Taye Diggs) is not angry and having other feelings when he he finds out what Preston is really up to. The man SMILES; should they not be shooting everybody who smiles?<br /><br /> Of course this film has to do with Preston, who like Bradbury's Montag becomes intrigued by all that society denies him and then tries to defy the system he has upheld. This is where things get interesting because Preston might be alone but he has the strength of ten men. Well, actually, he acts more like Neo in &quot;The Matrix&quot; movies. You can surround this guy with storm troopers holding guns to his head and he will kill them all. The fights are apparently are example of &quot;Gun-Kata,&quot; that is to say &quot;a martial art completely based around guns,&quot; and they are rather impressive, even by &quot;Matrix&quot; standards. Just do not ask me why anybody needs this much martial arts and weaponry training in a world of drug-induced stupors.<br /><br /> So the trick with &quot;Equilibrium&quot; is to balance the political position of the dystopian elements with the action sequences, in an apparent attempt to keep two very different types of audiences separate. It is rather difficult to enjoy the choreography of the gun battles while trying to deal with the deep philosophical issues that film is trying to raise in between the fights. In the end, what redeems this film somewhat is the end game, where Wimmer's film actually ups the ante and throws in enough twists and turns to make it really interesting. But even then if you do not see the about Father's identity coming then you do not know your classic films and the final sequence says to me that Wimmer is only pretending that he is trying to play on a higher level.to play on a higher level.  <br />  <br />  <br />
B00005JN2F|4.0|&quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; starts well and pretty much doesn't stop racing for two hours. Matt Damon, once again, looks terrific and acts well enough to give his amnesiac character some distinction.<br /><br /> Also, this film features some incredibly strong supporting work from Brian Cox and the fantastic Joan Allen. Franka Potente and Julia Stiles also make good impressions in this film, though they're both only in it for about five minutes.<br /><br /> The action sequences are pretty high-octane, however much of the camera work and split-second editing function to only give you a vague idea of what's happening onscreen, and I don't know if I could explain the complicated plot that leads to Bourne coming out of hiding.<br /><br /> Still, I &quot;got&quot; the film enough while I was watching it to enjoy the ride.
B00005JN2F|4.0|The pluses outweigh the minuses in &quot;The Bourne Supremacy,&quot; which is a good thing because both sides of the scale here are pretty significant. I am not sure if the credit for the pluses goes more to novelist Robert Ludlum for the novel &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; or to Tony Gilroy for the screenplay, but I know that the writing is the best part of this summer 2004 thriller. I have not read any of Ludlum's books, but I know Gilroy did the adaptation of &quot;Dolores Claiborne,&quot; so it could be either of them. I also know that the parts of the film that take away from &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; can be laid at the feet of director Paul Greengrass.<br /><br /> The one thing we know about a Jason Bourne film, as opposed to a James Bond film, is that somebody is always out to see him dead. Bond as least has a mission that has people trying to kill him; Bourne is on a hit list just by breathing. Matt Damon plays Bourne with a understatement that marks him apart from the rest of his secret agent brethren, and which also serves to emphasize the strength of the script. Introduced to the character as a badly wounded body floating in the Mediterranean who did not remember who he was, Bourne survived his first film never finding out his real name, just his identity as Jason Bourne, and dropped off the face of the earth to try and live happily ever after with Marie (Franka Potente), his unwilling ally and now only confidante.<br /><br /> Of course, they are doomed, and Bourne goes off to get the people who are trying to get him. This becomes somewhat confusing because the people out to get him on one continent are not same people trying to get him on all the other ones. But the important thing is that Bourne goes off to deliver payback and what is great about this character is his economy of effort. Jason Bourne can create a time bomb in thirty seconds using only three things and in his hands a bottle of vodka has a multitude of uses. Every time he gets into a sticky situation you know he is going to doing something smart and he is going to do it quickly. The intelligence of the character and the script is the strongest part of the movie.<br /><br /> But at the same time the script is delighting my brain director Paul Greengrass is trying to turn my stomach. Too much of this film is done by a hand-held camera, rarely to any great effect. Then there are the smash cuts and heavy editing of the fight scenes. What is the good of choreographing a one-on-one fight scene if all we get are quick impressions of what is going on. Then Greengrass starts throwing things together, so that we have hand-held shots of moving people cut at warp speed. This gets a bit disorienting at times and can provoke feelings of queasiness. But Bourne's intelligence overcome these visual liabilities.<br /><br /> Bourne is also the smartest person in the film, something it take CIA station chief Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) a while to understand, even though Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) and Nicolette (Julia Stiles) both explain this to her repeatedly. The end game of the film actually has a series of levels, so that it is not a simple thing to get everything resolved, and Bourne does have a hand in everything that happens. There is a strong thread of realism going throughout the impossible situations, but that is why the future of the Bourne series is different from the fate of the Bond flicks. &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; also gets points for the scenes in the movie that we see in the trailer are better in the movie than they are when cut together in the trailer.ets into a sticky situation you know he is going to doing something smart and he is going to do it quickly.

B0000019PA|5.0|I had to buy a second copy of this CD. <br /> <br />One day, as I was leaving work, my original copy of the CD broke open its jewel case and leapt forth in a daring and quixotic bid for freedom which was cut tragically short when it skidded to a stop, butter-side down, on the rough pavement of the parking lot. <br /> <br />In retrospect, given the nature of this CD, I was not surprised that it had made the attempt; indeed, the only surprise is that it did not succeed, and rise up into the distance to sail the endless skies forever.
B00003IPFK|5.0|It's simple.....there is nothing better to watch on TV or in the movie theatre than Lonesome Dove and the related series (i.e., Dead Man's Walk, Streets of Loredo, and Return to Lonesome Dove).<br /><br />If you have not seen Lonesome Dove.....SEE IT! NOW! It doesn't get better than that.
B000002N1E|5.0|I've never written a review before, but I simply had to respond to the one previously listed. Quite simply, The Gold Experience is the best of Prince's albums under the name O(+&gt; (rivalled in quality and consistency only by &quot;The Truth&quot; album released in conjunction with &quot;The Crystal Ball&quot; set).  <br />  <br /> Some of Prince's best raps appear here (&quot;P Control&quot; and &quot;Endorphinmachine&quot;), along with his most boisterous, raucous, and rollicking funk jams (&quot;Billy Jack Bitch&quot;---especially the joyous abandon of instrumental mayhem at the song's closing). Songs such as &quot;319&quot; and &quot;Shy&quot; exhibit a return to his sexual inventiveness. &quot;319&quot; documents a raunchy scene with a call girl; it's as lively, inventive, and energetic as past favorites &quot;Gett Off&quot; and &quot;Darling Nicki&quot; but kinky enough to conjure up more obscure songs, such as the excellent and riveting &quot;Pheromone&quot; from the sometimes dismissible &quot;Come&quot; album. &quot;Shy,&quot; on the other hand, is a meandering folk-soul jam about a girl mixed up in gang culture---the aimless musical sprawling cleverly mimics the girl's aimless wanderings in LA. &quot;Shy&quot; yet again showcases Prince's inimitable ability to combine genres effortlessly while painting a picture and telling a story in the music itself. <br />  <br /> The previous reviewer spoke too quickly in dismissing some songs as &quot;mainstream&quot; pop and R&B. &quot;Shhh&quot; is among Prince's most atmospheric sexual ballads, at once hearkening back to &quot;Do Me Baby&quot; while breaking the mold of its predecessor with more compelling drum parts, harmonies, dynamic shifts, sporadic guitar riffs, and a commanding, utterly confident vocal part. It is entirely too complex in its aural landscapes for anyone to classify it as a &quot;mainstream R&B&quot; song.  <br />  <br /> &quot;I Hate U&quot; may have been released as a single, but that doesn't mean that it's a useless pop throwaway. It's frankness is signature Prince---the lyrics more than redeem this song from any sentimentality. Consider the line: &quot;I'd like 2 have the defendant place her hands behind her back / So I can tie her up tight and get into the act / The act of showing her how good it used 2 be / I want it 2 be so good she falls back in love with me.&quot; What other artist switches so swiftly between metaphoric ideas over a range of emotions, from the indifferent to the sexually charged to the emotionally heartbroken? He goes from 'witness on the stand', to 'kinky lover in the bedroom', to lovelorn ambivalence---all in 4 lines! Prince gives his audience plenty of credit in putting such a range of feelings in his lyrical images and musical impressions. <br />  <br /> In short, this album is a pure return to form for Prince---and by &quot;form&quot; I don't mean &quot;formulaic.' At his best, Prince's form has always been to explore and expand upon his previous innovations. He does not repeat himself on &quot;The Gold Experience.&quot; On this album, Prince exhibits that unaging freshness that his last official Prince albums simply lacked (&quot;Diamonds and Pearls&quot; and &quot;O(+&gt;&quot;).  <br />  <br /> In short, this album is more than worth its purchase price, and its complexity and breadth reward close listening!
0140143505|5.0|Especially when the letters are interesting and well written. As noted, this is the story of the developing relationship between a bibliophile in New York and a book dealer in London. I picked up this book at a used bookstore, never having heard of it before, and was instantly hooked.        The best part of this book is that Helene Hanff -- who is also the writer of the letters -- includes letters from people other than the book dealer, who also have an appropriate place in the story. There are her friends who go to London and visit the bookstore; there is the book dealer's wife; and there is the old woman who lives near the book dealer, too. Over twenty years' time, you get a peek into the lives of these people and how they affected each other. The epilogue (one final letter giving permission for Helene Hanff to Frank Doel's letters) was an especially nice touch, as it gives the book closure and ties things together with a sad but sweet ribbon.        My final question is: how did she go about getting the mail she sent out? Was it returned to her, or did she mimeograph it? I noticed there are some letters missing -- alluded to in other letters but not in the book. But how did she get letters she sent to people who moved to Australia and were never heard from again, etc.? A little curiosity there, as I have never made a copy of a letter I'm sending out...        If you want a quick but memorable book, please give Ms. Hanff's a read.

B00005JMEW|5.0|Violent and brilliant, this is a Quentin Tarantino masterpiece.  It stars Uma Thurman as an assassin whose entire wedding party was murdered on her wedding day.  She's in a coma for four years but when she wakes up she's after revenge and so she begins to wreck havoc on everyone who was involved in the crime.  Basically, that's the plot line but this film is more than just a story.  It is a brilliant interpretation of the action-martial arts genre.  And it's so fast-paced and outrageous that I just sat there and admired the intricately choreographed sequences of violence.<br /><br />Blood flows, limbs fly and heads are chopped off.  This sounds gruesome but there is a comic book quality to it all.  In fact, there is one sequence where Tarantino makes good use of animation, which fits in perfectly with the story.<br /><br />I must admit though that after a while I did get a little bored.  There is one scene where Uma Thurman wipes out about fifty assassins and there was a bit of sameness to it all.  Also, I never identified or had any real sympathy for the characters.  But this film was never conceived to be about subtle emotions.  And so I must judge it for what it is.  And in spite of (or maybe because of) the blood and violence, it is definitely entertaining.<br /><br />There are some good features on the DVD also.  It added to the experience of watching this film.<br /><br />Recommended.  And I can't wait to see Vol. 2.
1577311523|5.0|&quot;The Power of Now&quot; offers many ultra-powerful techniques for improving one's experience of self & the world. Greater than that, it shares a perspective from which one's self & world become a source of joy. This is enlightenment.  <br />  <br /> Personally, after trying both, I prefer the audio-tapes to the book. Read by Eckhart, they are soothing and take you though the text with the intended tone. <br />  <br /> Enjoy. <br />
B00005JMYG|4.0|Will Ferrell, a particularly humorous person in my opinion, has created the partially witty but mostly overt throwback to those old days of anchoring.  When men were men, and they thought women were too.  Now, that is not true.  It is interesting however that, although portrayed in a comedic manner, gender segregation was a component of early broadcasting.  History aside, Anchorman was creative, albeit not the wittiest piece of work in film.  Enjoyable, maybe if only for the first viewing, this film still has some shine.
0064400018|4.0|What I've always enjoyed about the Laura Ingalls Wilder books is her loving attention to detail and her beautiful depictions of family life - not just the daily chores and jobs of a pioneer family, but the warmth and closeness that every family should have.  For instance, when reading this book you are instantly transported to the small cabin, where the fire is going strong and Ma is knitting and Pa is tickling his daughters with his beard and telling them terrifying stories of panthers.  When there's rain, you are up in the attic with Mary and Laura as they play among the hanging vegetables and listen to the drops drumming on the roof.  Then the holidays arrive with their rare sweets and some respite from daily work.  Truly, a beautiful book, and though it's not my favorite from the series, it's still a gem worth reading.
B000286SCO|5.0|This is a must especialy for a Australian fan whom up until now have not had the chance to see these guys in concert. Do not buy this collection expecting to see and hear top notch production as these film where taken from video tape particularly the Live in Tokyo the volume is quite low. However what the production value lacks the Band makes up for in shear brilliance. <br />My favorite out of the set is the second coming in just on 2 hours we see the later 90's version of Dream Theater in 6 or 7 different concerts with tour video in  between. In fact it will make you wish that they would put out the Rotterdam show and the Paris show (last) on their own.  <br />I guess this is for the die hard fan but you don't by Dream Theater on a whim, enjoy.
B00005JN1L|4.0|As soon as I saw that a new Johnny Depp film was about to be released into theaters, I knew that I had to see it. I am stickler for Johnny Depp movies and I collect them to watch over and over again. He is by far my MOST FAVORITE ACTOR and this one proved his acting intelligence to me again. I own this DVD and love to play it over again because he gets me everytime.   I think David Koepp (screenwriter and director) is ok when it comes to thrillers and that is why I gave this DVD a 4-star rating. He tends to underedit his films and probably bores some people out of his mind. I thought the same for this movie and Panic Room. I just saw Stir of Echoes and would rate it mediocre.   Johnny Depp plays Mort Rainey, a stressed, hermit crab writer who is going through a divorce from his wife, Amy Rainey (Maria Bello). Amy cheated on Mort with Ted Melvin (Timothy Hutton) and Mort \\"stumbled\\" on them in a motel room (Erv's Lakesider). One day, six months later, a man by the name of John Shooter (John Tuturro) knocks on Mort's door and accuses him of plagarism. Shooter gives him three days to prove him wrong, thus making Mort a little jumpy. Mort does NOT like people messing around with his property. In fact, I think he makes a reference to this point in the film. The ending of the plot is gripping and I won't ruin for you except to say that the sharp biting of the ear of corn at the end is unexpected and grabs your attention for the last time! Definitely see it if you can!
B00005NMXI|5.0|One day, I was searching for an MP3 of an old Willie Nelson song my dad used to play, Pancho and Lefty, when I came across the version by Townes Van Zandt, who wrote it. I downloaded it out of curiosity and loved it. Much rawer, much more emotive, much more poetic than Nelson's recording. I searched for more Van Zandt songs and slowly dug my way into a catalogue that is incredible. I looked on Amazon to see which records to buy and found this, Texas Troubadour, which compiles seven studio albums and a live set -- all for price that comes out to something like seven bucks a record. I bought it and have been listening to it almost weekly for more than a year. All I can say about Townes Van Zandt is that if you appreciate great songwriting, you'll appreciate this collection. He didn't have the most radio-friendly sound; Willie Nelson and others who've covered his songs have met that challenge. But nothing beats the emotional connections of a songwriter singing and guitaring his own work. Think Bob Dylan or Neil Young or Johnny Cash or even someone like John Frusciante -- great songwriters with rough but unique voices and instantly recognizable guitar playing. Some of my favorite songs by Zandt at this moment are &quot;Rake,&quot; &quot;You Are Not Needed Now,&quot; &quot;Flyin' Shoes,&quot; &quot;Waitin' Around to Die,&quot; &quot;Highway Kind,&quot; &quot;Snow Don't Fall,&quot; and &quot;Lungs.&quot; I wish I would've had the chance to know and see Van Zandt play live when he was around. At least we have his records. Do yourself a favor and buy them!
0688163173|5.0|Based on another recommendation from my local librarian, I picked up Shutter Island by Dennis Lehane.  This is an unusual mystery with a wicked twist at the end.<br /><br />Teddy Daniels is a US Marshal in the summer of 1954, and he's been asked to head out to Shutter Island to help track down a missing patient/inmate.  Shutter Island is a mental hospital and semi-prison where criminals with major psychological issues are sent.  Ward A and Ward B are split between men and women, and Ward C is for the hardcore cases.  Teddy and his partner Chuck Aule take the ferry to the island and start their investigation.  But the site seems to be larger and more heavily guarded than is necessary for a simple psychiatric institution.  The staff seem to be hiding something, and there is no cooperation to find the missing woman who escaped.  There are clues she left, and he's trying to break her code to figure out what's really going on out there.  He's also convinced that the guy who killed his wife in an apartment fire is also on the island, and he wants to settle the score.  But as he gets closer to the answer, reality as he knows it makes a dramatic shift.<br /><br />This was a different read, in that the story setting in the mid-50's seemed to give it a darker, edgier feel.  The interaction between the two partners is interesting, and takes on a different view as the story progresses.  And the plot twist was fully unexpected and was a mind-bender.  An intelligent read and superb story.

B0001MDP3G|2.0|Charles Frazier's book is a masterpiece and his love of the time and area of the country (Civil War & Blue Ridge/Appalachian Mtns)show on every page. For some inexplicable reason Anthony Minghella chose to change the most basic parts of the novel to fit Hollywood's expectations and pocketbooks. Nicole Kidman shows no emotion, heck she goes thru the entire movie with barely a hair out of place! Renee Zellwenger is better, but I did not see the need to put her in that part when there are so many talented black actresses that could have done as well or better (if you've read the book you will understand). Jude Law is the only main part that comes close to understanding and relating to the novel. Excellent acting. Only a fair movie, very disappointing.

B00028HBKM|5.0|This is a film about subjects most people would rather avoid.<br /><br />Death & religion don't lend themselves to rational discussion. Mel Gibson haters<br />will see this as proof of his insanity & intolerance. Christians will see too much violence to be on a big screen. Humanists will see the shining truth that Christians are gullible fools willingly self deceived, but what about the movie making?<br /><br />The events that are being depicted here are detailed fairly well in the bible. Does the movie stay close to its literary source as far as events & beatings & death? I say yes it does.<br /><br />Someone somewhere should get credit for putting that on the screen. Your sense of appropriate levels of violence really took a beating in this story as it's told in the Bible. Go complain there. The movie is a good pictorial representation of the subject matter it claims to cover which is, the suffering & death of a man known as Jesus Christ as revealed in a book about his life.<br /><br />You can claim that Jesus never existed. You can claim that these events never happened. You can claim all kinds of personal preferences but you can't claim that this is a bad movie because it didn't stay close to its literary source. You can't claim that it deliberately embellished that story. Mel Gibson certainly didn't create the story & since it wasn't intended to meet any other muster than its relationship to its source I feel it must be highly rated as a movie & movie making.<br /><br />Are you offended by the show for some reason? The show doesn't care. It wasn't made to not offend. To belittle what was done on screen here is to belittle every movie that ever stayed close to its literary source. I understand that people will have deep feelings because of their personal beliefs but it's really sad to see a movie bring out the sentiments where all opposition is based on personal beliefs & no discussion of the movie or it's crafting.<br /><br />The violence is deep, gritty & horrifying but the subject requires it from the source. This is 5 star cinema & it's not for everyone. Especially not young unformed personalities.<br /><br />You know, you can discuss death, even murder, with a little child but it has to be within his speech & comprehension level. You can show him pictures of death & murder that far exceed their speech & comprehension levels & these images most assuredly exceed what children can comprehend.<br /><br />I'd just like to see more individual evaluations.

There are no stairs in the tower! You climb to the top via a series of brick paved ramps, 32 in total as I recall. Sorry for being a bit of an anorak!!
B0001AP12G|5.0|By now, everyone's heard the name Kanye West, everyone's heard the stunning beats he crafts, but when his debut album, &quot;The College Dropout&quot; was released, no one knew of his rhyming skills. Kanye's lyrics are interesting, witty and insightful, backed by a flow that's on point for the whole album. His beats ... I don't even know where to start. They're pure works of art that you never get tired of hearing. The same could be said for the album - &quot;The College Dropout&quot; is a work of art that you never get tired of hearing. <br />  <br /> Kanye sounds like a veteran on the mic, even managing to outshine Jay Z on the stunning &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot; and is so comfortable on &quot;Family Business&quot;, an insightful cut about love in the family, where he spits lines like: <br />  <br /> 'This is family business, and this is for the family that can't be with us' <br />  <br /> 'I woke up early this morning with a new state of mind, a creative way to rhyme without using knives and guns, keep your nose out the sky and your heart to God, and keep your face to the rising sun' <br />  <br /> Kanye and Syleena Johnson get busy on the bouncy tribue to self doubt, &quot;All Falls Down&quot;, which perfectly samples Lauryn Hill's &quot;Mystery Of Inequity&quot;. Twista and Jamie Foxx also get down with Kanye on the classic &quot;Slow Jamz&quot;, with that adictive chorus and MJ joke. Of course we've all heard the classic &quot;Through the Wire&quot;, which is enough reason to buy the album alone, and it needs no explanation. &quot;School Spirit&quot; and &quot;Breathe In Breathe Out&quot; both have that a bouncy southern feel to them, with two of Kanye's finest beats. Mr West showcases his incredible wit on &quot;The New Workout Plan&quot;, a summery number that pokes fun at goldiggers. After all that and more, Kanye rounds off the album with the 12 minute long &quot;Last Call&quot;, where he talks about his rise in the industry and how he got to where he is. <br />  <br /> Kanye's on point in all aspects of his game on &quot;The College Dropout&quot;, something that few rappers bring to the table. Of course the beats are top notch, and Kanye is setting the industry standard at the momment with his production. This is an album you'll be playing and loving for the rest of your life. if you haven't already copped it, you should invest in the essential music experience. 5 stars - Classic.

The scene where he's riding in the truck with her five brothers all glaring at him was hilarious.  A sweet movie that's safe to watch with your mother...
0440211727|4.0|I don't know, maybe it's me- but A Time to Kill is one of my favorite movies and one that I've watched often- which made reading this book a bit tedious.  I kept comparing it to the movie, picturing scenes from it, but when I was finally able to get beyond that- I did enjoy the book- one that I've always been meaning to read.<br /><br />If you don't know, the story takes place in rural Mississippi where a 10 year old black girl is brutally raped and tortured.  She survives, but the event was too much for her father- who took a gun and shot and killed the two boys who did that to her.  Now, he's on trial for his life, facing the gas chamber.  And while many juries might be sympathetic to his ordeal, where the racial lines are drawn, it's not easy for a white jury to sympathize with a black man who has just killed their own...<br /><br />Overall I did enjoy the book.  The last 200 pages really picked up the pace, while the first 200 or so dragged a bit for me.  As the forward by Grisham says, he does ramble a bit, but some of his description and story are priceless.  The overall theme of the book is commendable and unforgettable.
B0000020C4|5.0|Despite much wishing and hoping and daydreaming on the part of fans, there, of course, can never be a true dream cast. Circumstances like time, place, and personal issues must all be factored in. However, the Tenth Anniversary Concert is as close a truly perfect cast for Les Miserables as there can ever be. <br />  <br /> Every single performer simply shines. Colm Wilkinson as Jean Valjean is beyond words. Though he has aged much since this performance, his mellow voice is finer with age, and he soars while delivering the anguished revelations and enlightenments that transpire over Vlajean's hard life. From the first bitter words exchanged with Javert at Toulon, to the tremulous epilogue, Wilkinson is simply breathtaking.  <br />  <br /> As for Philip Quast's Javert... he simply astounds. There has never been and never will be a better Javert. His counterpoints are absolutely flawless in both technique and delivery, and every note is rich with emotion - or lack thereof, as suits the inspector. &quot;Stars&quot; simply brought the house down, and &quot;Javert's Suicide&quot; will leave your spine tingling long after the last note has faded away. <br />  <br /> Of course, not to give the men all the glory, Ruthie Henshall's portrayal of Fantine is haunting. Her voice is naturally gifted with a melodic musicality that years of training cannot give, and there are moments when her heartbreaking renditions truly will bring tears to the audience's eyes. Especially noteworthy is her return as a phantom in the Epilogue; close your eyes while you listen to her then. Truly ethereal. <br />  <br /> The Thenardiers are an absolute delight. Alun Armstrong is a bit too nasal on some of his parts, but nobody beats him at sounding like a beady little conspiring rat. Jenny Galloway is harsh and hearty, and gives a perfect little touch of affected melodrama at certain parts. A joy to listen to. <br />  <br /> Speaking of which, skip to &quot;The Last Battle&quot; and take a listen toEnjolras. It's not so much a joy to listen to as goosebump-inducing. Michael Maguire nails that last glory note, and every other one that he has. His Enjolras is dedicated, idealistic, passionate, and just slightly insane. He gestures with pure fervor, sings with the power of conviction. He inspires, and truly makes you believe. It is a small wonder that les Amis would follow him to battle. <br />  <br /> And where would we be without our lovelorn couple, Marius and Cosette? Michael Ball and Judy Kuhn each put on one of the best versions of either character I have ever heard. Granted, Michael Ball is a bit around the bend to be Marius, but the note of bewilderment and naivety to his voice sounds is authentic, and his performance of &quot;Empty Chairs at Empty Tables&quot; resonates with the sorrow of loss and a wisdom gained by pain. Judy Kuhn, similarly, shows her Cosette on a journey of growth. Her voice is deeply tender, and melodic, and her portrayal of Cosette shows an unusual side of spirit and independence. Their duets are extremely listenable, and you grow even fonder of the two with each passing time. <br />  <br /> And then there's Eponine. I was sorely disappointed that Frances Ruffelle declined the invitation, as she was the first Eponine I had ever heard and still my favourite to date. However, Lea Salonga is hardly a bad replacement. Lea's voice is deeper, her delivery smoother, and there is an acute note of bitterness especially in her high range. Her acting is superb, and her exchanges with the Patron-Minette and Thenardier are truly fiery. Lea delivers a very different interpretation from Frances' version, and each inspires vastly extreme feedback. <br />  <br /> Despite this amazing cast, however, the one man who stole my heart during the show was one who did not even have a whole song to sing. Anthony Crivello, the oft-overlooked Grantaire, is simply magnificent. The swagger, the slur, the hysterics, and the chemistry with Enjolras are all just right, and he put his heart into every note of his solo in &quot;Drink With Me&quot; for a truly chilling epiphany of truth. <br />  <br /> And last but not least, the children. They're just... such talent, such stage presence, and such range and power in their actions and words - and at such a young age! Truly remarkable, all of them. Hannah Chick shows incredible poise is &quot;Castle On A Cloud&quot;, and Andy Searles makes for such an endearing little Gavroche.  <br />  <br /> Finally, there's no talking about the Concert without at least mentioning the incredible ensemble. More than 250 singers from around the world gathered for this, and the power of their collective voices is absolutely shattering. <br />  <br /> There are many recordings of Les Miserables. The Tenth Anniversary Concert is the one no Les Mis fan can do without.
B0002EXH4A|2.0|I think Michael Wagener had this perfect. Whatever he did, it enhanced the anger and frailty in the music and vocals. This new mix really strips those elements. <br /> <br />Sure, it's a lot cleaner, but it comes off kinda artificial. The snare is generic-sounding and has a very small sound in most of the songs. The huge snare of the original was a great point, and now it's gone. Only Liar and Hook in Mouth have a somewhat big snare sound. Although, the backing vocal chants on Hook in Mouth as each letter of FREEDOM is shouted are missing.  <br /> <br />The leads are pushed back in the mix and sound more tinny and thin. <br /> <br />Set the World Afire sounds especially castrated. IMDH loses the numb vibe a bit and the drums are totally different-sounding. It also has the scream cut from the ending of the song.  <br /> <br />Into the Lungs of Hell is better though. It has a horn added and there's some new stuff you can hear now. Mary Jane is the only other song I would say is near as good as the original mix. It really brings the acoustic guitar and vocals upfront, which completely changes the beginning of the song.  <br /> <br />I think by cleaning this record up, it falls short. SFSGSW is not a record that really could've been cleaned up, due to the original recording process. It's a lot like when you see new stuff added to the Star Wars movies, it just comes off weird.  <br /> <br />This record sounds planned and processed now, not out of control and in-your-face like the original did. It's still a good metal cd, but kinda a blasphemy as well. A straight remaster would've been very nice instead of this remix. <br /> <br />I thought that maybe the Paul Lani mixes would be alright. They sound like worse versions of the Wagener mixes from the original. Once you hear the Mustaine and Lani mixes, you'll really see how much better the original mix was. <br /> <br />If you absolutely hate the old mix and arrangements and love the idea of a clean, castrated SFSGSW without the huge drums, then this is for you. I would advise everyone else to stay clear of it.
B000002JSN|5.0|I know it was alittle before my time, but every heavy rock/blues fan should have this in their rack..  If your not a fan before, listen to this one and it will turn you on to them, then start listening to the earlier stuff...  Who needs drugs, when you got ZEPPLIN!!!
B0002EXH54|4.0|The remixing here is superb, except a few minor complaints. <br />  <br /> The title track has the snare cut down, it kinda just blends in with the rest of the song now.  <br />  <br /> The Conjuring has a sound effect replacing &quot;centralise&quot; in the line: &quot;A straw of a broom, Fold, and, burn, and, centralise&quot;. It just doesn't sound right. <br />  <br /> The lead thing going on in the background of Devil's Island during: &quot;Oh, hear the call, From the grave beyond. <br /> Oh, so pernicious, Her soul it creates song. <br /> As there is no man, that is Here upon the earth, <br /> Able to terminate our Noisome will since birth&quot;, has been made even harder to hear. I was hoping it'd be brought out in front. <br />  <br /> That said, the remix is quite true to the original otherwise and very pumped up.
B000068G9X|2.0|This is the first and last Danzig album I'll own (and I'm thinking about selling it.) The popular and yet mediocre tracks like Mother have become beyond boring and over played on rock stations. As for the rest of the album that is less than mediocre, it seems it was thrown together without much creativity. It could be said, Danzig is close to being a one hit wonder. CLOSE to it. There are one or two other songs that are close to being decent; Twist of Cain being an example. I never thought much about the Misfits and Danzig is not much better. With this said, if Danzig is a leading band of Southern Rock, then this genre might be in trouble.
B0002EXH4K|5.0|I was surprised at this remix. The production is actually worse, but it makes it cooler in a way. The music sounds raw, especially the guitars. The original mix was perfect, and Dave has taken this back and removed that perfect element. It almost sounds low-budget. The pure sound quality is nowhere as good either, it's a bit more noisy and messy compared to the original.  <br /> <br />This gives a lot of the tracks an added bite(Skin O My Teeth, Symphony, and Architecture namely)or increased bleakness(Foreclosure, Captive Honour).  <br /> <br />The vocals have been brought upfront a lot more, and are pretty true to the original mix. The snare is toned down a bit and sounds hard, but is a much better snare sound then he got for the remixes of Rust, Youth, or SFSGSW. <br /> <br />The treatment given to this is the opposite of SFSGSW. It's like, with SFSGSW, he castrated it by trying to make a raw and unpolished record into a polished record, and with CTE, he's taken a polished record and removed the polish resulting in a more powerful sound. <br /> <br />There aren't significant individual changes. There's an added intro to Sweating Bullets, that goes into the original intro(which now sounds very demonic), and extended High Speed Dirt into that seems really unnecessary, and Foreclosure has some leads made more prominent during the verses. It sounds quite a bit different, like a new song. Otherwise, the whole album is like the original, but with the layer of polish stripped away. <br /> <br />I wouldn't say it's better then the original, because it's not, it's just different-and a very good different at that.
B00004RJ74|5.0|From Dusk Till Dawn is a classic combination of two of the best directors of the 90s, Quentin Tarrantino and Robert Rodriquez, to make one of the greatest action/horror films of the decade. With an endless supply of big stars old and new, this film is an amazing display of great filmmaking. <br /> <br />Seth Gecko, played by George Clooney, and his brother Richard, played by Tarrantino, are on the run from the law. They are complete oppisites. Seth likes to make sure everyone gets through everything in one piece and Richard just wants to kill everyone he sees. They are told to meet a client, played by Cheech Marin, at a bar in Mexico. To make sure that they can cross the border without getting busted, they kidnap an unsupecting family of vactioners and force them to drive them to the bar in Mexico. When they get to the bar, they realize something is wrong, and all hell breaks loose. <br /> <br />The film is well directed and very well made. The stellar acting by Tarrantino, Clooney and Harvey Keitel is undeniable. Definately one of the best made horror films, this is a true classic for fans of film.
B00000612P|4.0|This album is maybe the best of all of Rod's releases. It's not pretentious, superflual, or light like some of Rod Stewart's records. This was the album that made me dig more into Rod's music and also into Jeff Beck's and Faces
B0001HAHXW|3.0|Okay, don't get me wrong. This is a great album. However, there are alot of things wrong with it. It is, however, a great retrospective of Robert Johnson's greatest recordings. <br /> <br />There are a few things wrong with this disc. One of the problems is Clapton's vocal atempt at matching Robert Johnson's vocal talents. When he tries to sound like Johnson, his voice cracks like he's going through adolescence again. Also, Clapton's style of playing does not equal Johnson's original sound and at times sounds forced.   <br /> <br />All criticism aside, this is a great tool for people trying to find out more about Robert Johnson. It gives a great look at one of the greatest musicians of the 20th century.
B000002MFE|5.0|I've had this album since it came out in the early 90s, and it has lost none of its appeal. Sometimes you'll listen an album to death within six months, but I still go back to Eric Clapton's \\"Unplugged\\" now and then, and it's as fresh as it was fourteen years ago. And that's rare praise.      This is Eric Clapton's most succesful album, a multiple grammy winner, and one of his three or four best records (alongside \\"From The Cradle\\", \\"Layla And Other Assorted Love Songs\\", and \\"Eric Clapton's Rainbow Concert\\"). Containing some of the finest music Clapton had recorded for many years, the straighforward \\"Unplugged\\" session was freed from the slick pop-production of his 80s albums, alternating between electric songs recast in acoustic arrangements, and classic blues songs by the likes of Robert Johnson and Jesse Fuller.      Acoustic music really leaves no place for a mediocre musician to hide, and there were no mediocre musicians accompanying Eric Clapton for his \\"Unplugged\\" session...second guitarist Andy Fairweather-Low and former Allman Brothers pianist Chuck Leavell are particularly superb, and then there's Clapton himself, of course. If anyone doubted that this guy is actually a pretty decent guitar player, this album should set them straight...he plays acoustic slide guitar like he'd never done anything else, and the concert goes from highlight to highlight:      \\"Tears In Heaven\\" is here, and a jazzy, acoustic \\"Layla\\", but most of these tracks are pure blues. Slow, mournful blues like \\"Malted Milk\\", swinging, up-tempo numbers, including an irresistable \\"San Francisco Bay Blues\\", and tough, mid-tempo grooves like Bo Diddley's \\"Before You Accuse Me\\", and a superb \\"Alberta\\" (with a magnificent solo by Chuck Leavell).   Clapton's slide playing is particularly good on \\"Rollin' And Tumblin'\\", and on a wonderful rendition of \\"Running On Faith\\", and I would kill (or at least maim) in order to be able to play the piano like Chuck Leavell does on the classic \\"Nobody KnowsYou When You're Down And Out\\".      The sound is excellent, very clear and realistic, and the separation is great. Sure, some will prefer to hear Robert Johnson playing Robert Johnson, but don't hold that against Eric Clapton. He does very well by Johnson, Big Bill Broonzy, Jimmy Cox, and the rest, and \\"Unplugged\\" is a superb hour of real music played on real instruments, and arranged by a great professional.   There is nothing bad to say about this album at all, actually.  How about that?
B000002U82|5.0|This is how I wish all rock groups played. I love Soul and funk music and these guys were actually getting a little funky on this one! I heard this album in my high school psychology class this past year because my teacher wanted to show how it goes along with the Wizard of Oz (it does and it freaked everyone out). I often said Pink Floyd sucked just to piss off some of my white friends. I don't anymore instead I say Hoobastank or whatever crap they listen to sucks but Pink Floyd doesn't suck they are one of the best bands ever (not better than Earth Wind & Fire or Isley Brothers but good enough for me).
B000060P79|1.0|I'm not exaggerating when I say that this CD is one of the worst I've heard this year. While their music is fine from a technical point, it's all very ... samey. It's like they took the same three chords and played them over and over again, just in a different order. <br /> <br />Their lyrics are incredibly immature. They must be, what, early-mid 20s? Why on earth are they singing stupid songs about how much their parents hate them?  <br /> <br />If you're into Good Charlotte and the wave of faux-punk music that's sweeping the world, you'll love this. If you're into something a little more deeper, stay away and look elsewhere.
0316779237|2.0|After a glowing recommendation from my sister, I got this book and have to say I have mixed feelings about it.  The (pseudo) non-fiction essays (Santland Diaries and Diana the Christmas Whore) are extremely funny and well worth reading.  Unfortunately, the fiction essays are horrible.  They are very mean spirited, pessimistic, and well, just not very funny.  The satire is laid on thick and shameless, as if he had a bet going to see how absurd and over the top he could make a story.  And each one is worse than the next.  I was drowning in it.  I've heard better reviews about some of his other books, so I'll give those a try.  I would never recommend anyone buy this book, but please check it out from your library if just to read those non fiction essays. <br /> <br />
B000002GY9|4.0|while the ballads here are generally superior to those found on blue valentine, this album really proves that tom waits' primary talent lies in delivering the gritty carnivalesque stuff, the back-alley jazz. &quot;step right up&quot;--one of tom waits' best songs and one of my personal favorites--and &quot;pasties and a g-string&quot; play to his strengths and indicate the rougher, more eclectic style that he would turn to with the release of swordfishtrombones. thankfully, he never looked back.
B00004RF9B|5.0|I first saw `Forbidden Planet' when it was originally released in theaters in the late 1950's and at the time, it simply blew me away, and it was my hands down favorite hard core Science Fiction movie up to the release of `2001 A Space Odyssey'. And, even then, I begrudgingly pidgeonholed `2001' into its own special category to preserve the preeminant place of my beloved `Forbidden Planet'.<br /><br />The very first thing which sets `Forbidden Planet' off from so many other 1950's sci-fi movies is that it is clearly not simply a monster movie. Not that there are no good monster movies. Whitness `The Thing' and, of course, `King Kong', but `Forbidden Planet' was pure sci-fi, the kind which is driven by the defining characteristic of the genre. That is the proposition `What if this particular thing were true? What would follow from this (and be turned into the basis of the story)'. The fact that the story was an adaptation of William Shakespeare's `The Tempest' made absolutely no impression on me, as I didn't even realize this until long after the movie had passed into cult heaven. It was much  more impressive to me to realize that the whole idea of `Star Trek' was based on some of the `Forbidden Planet' premises.<br /><br />Watching this movie after almost 50 years of revering it's memory does a lot to enable a more balanced evaluation of the movie. The first thing is that while it remains one of the very best of its period and genre, it is not necessarily head and shoulders over other sci-fi movies of the same period. `The Day the Earth Stood Still' comes to mind as a critically successful movie of the time. But, aside from it's being in color, some differences between `Forbidden Planet' and `The Day...' stand out. The first is the quality of the special effects, done for M-G-M by a team from the Walt Disney studio. In the world of pre `2001' effects, `Forbidden Planet' probably outdid every other movie in special effects quality. They look ordinary by today's standards, but they were most definitely not as hokey as the run of the mill stuff in 1955. The flagship effect, of course, is Robbie the Robot who, to this day, I sneakily believe was a real machine and not a tin suit with someone inside. Even if Robbie was controlled by a human at a console at the end of a long cable, I was still impressed. Robbie set the standard for artificial intelligence on film until the Hal 9000 arrived on the scene. Another aspect of the movie which clearly set it apart from the rest of the pack is the distinctive nature of the sound track music. The credits clearly indicate that the music is synthesized and not performed on traditional string, wind, or percussion instruments. Like so many other things, this music defined sci-fi music for an entire generation.<br /><br />The very best thing about the movie was the sophistication of the `what if' premise. The story is that a scientific team of 20 people lands on the planet Altair 4 and 18 of the 20 are killed by a monstrous entity of pure energy created from the `id' of the team's philologist, Dr. Morbius, enhanced by the technology of the long dead natives of the planet, the Krell, who were killed by their unleashing these `monsters from the id' in their quest to attain a life of pure energy, separated from the body. Even the names `Morbius' and `Krell' have an enchantment about them which rings something in the soul of a teenager of the time.<br /><br />My memory of the plot of `The Tempest' is a bit rusty, but I can see the similarity in a nobleman, `Prospero' being stranded on a remote island with daughter, Miranda and their being found by a party in a passing ship. I also recall the character of Caliban, a `savage and deformed slave' according to my complete Shakespeare. The part of Caliban is played, with a major overhaul, by Robbie, of course. I can see no analogue to the facinating character of Ariel, `an airy spirit'. The adaptors of Will Shakespeare's idea should have made an effort tolearn some dialogue from the bard as well as his story line.<br /><br />The most glaring blemish in the movie is some of the really dreadful use of words of which I am sure the script writers were proud as being examples of supplying new words for concepts of the future. Unfortunately, this dialogue grates rather than impresses. The other surface blemish is the sophmoric romantic action between the space ship Bellerophon's senior officers and daughter Altara. The behavior is so obvious and so contrived that I would have thought they could resist this easy business. But, they did not, and it does not one wit to move the story along. The rather amusing little encounter between the stereotyped ship's cook and Robbie makes a bigger contribution to the story than these romantic interests.<br /><br />These are merely surface defects which I have been able to overlook through several viewings over the course of my life. It has only been on this latest viewing that they stick out from the otherwise remarkable quality of the movie. The heart of the movie is the basic premise of the Krell, their fantastic power sources and machines built into the heart of the planet, their effort to free themselves from material form, and their distruction upon unleashing hidden powers from the very Freudian notion of the id, short for libido. As long as you are willing to buy into this premise, things go smoothly, but once you start thinking this through, the premise falls apart. But, this is sci-fi, after all, where time travel and faster than light travel are possible, so sit back and enjoy the ride.<br /><br />A tarnished jewel of a movie, one of the very few `50s sci-fi works which deserve to be watched today.fort to learn some dialogue from the bard as well as his story line. <br /> <br />The most glaring blemish in the movie is some of the really dreadful use of words of which I am sure the script writers were proud as being examples of supplying new words for concepts of the future.

B000002N2N|5.0|I can't imagine this one slipped through the cracks of anyone's collection, but hands down, this is the greatest live recording of ANY band EVER. I've had 26 years getting to know this one. My first copy (I've had 6 of them) was vinyl, of course- it was a single sleeved double lp- each side clocked in at around 15 minutes. Back then I would utilize the spindle- which would drop the next side down after one had finished playing. Ahhhh, yes. In 1978 I would get my butt kicked for my love of this band- hearing those cheering voices in the audience reaffirmed my belief that this was a band worthy of my time and energy.<br /><br /> Track for track, this is a classic- and while I'll never know why the Ramones weren't HUGE later, I'll know that this document is proof that we were right- the Ramones were the best thing going in the seventies. With three studio albums behind them- this live one caught them sounding the closest to the real thing- the REAL sound of the Ramones of the late seventies. There will NEVER be another band as great as the one on these 4 sides, and that's a real drag. The title was lifted straight outta &quot;The Bride 0f Frankenstein&quot; and the sound straight outta the heart and soul of rock and roll.
B0002DB52M|4.0|Lars Von Triers look at American customs and its plights is a provocative and moving movie that is spellbinding to say the least .I don't agree with what he is trying to say but I agree that it's a stunning film that does deserve a look. Nicole Kidman is compelling as a mysterious woman named Grace, who stirs up a small down with he abrasive ideology and homespun views on their western customs. The small town is really one huge sound stage that has chalk outlining as its boarders, and the way Lars puts these to used is a good way to comment on how close we are together as people. Paul Bettany is good as Tom, the man who helps Grace in this little town and Lauren Bacall is stunning as Ma Ginger. This is a first in a trilogy by Lars Von Triers, and if any of the other movies in the series is as good as this movie, then we will have a treat in moviemaking.
B00008MZ0N|1.0|As intricate and dense and complicated as the English language is, there are no truly appropriate words to describe how bad this film is.<br /><br />I could try abysmal, awful, horrendous, diabolical, pointless, irresponsible, heinous, wretched, terrible, dire, dreadful times infinity for infinity. But that still wouldn't be enough. Yes, I am being as subtle as a brick in the face. But compared to this movie I am being so low-key you'd never notice.<br /><br />Starring two of the WORST 'leading men' in history, this film is about just one thing; appealing to the masses. The masses have no taste. They will slovenly lap up anything as look as it looks good. The Fast and the Furious however, tastes BAD!<br /><br />The acting is horrible (including Michelle Rodriguez playing, YET AGAIN, a scowling Latino!-How about something different Miss Rodriguez?), the script is pure trash and the direction is junk. I guess you could say I liked TFATF when I first saw it...back in 1991 when it starred Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze and was called Point Break. See if you get me...<br /><br />An undercover cop infiltrates a group of adrenaline junkies to solve a string of robberies and ends up falling for the leader's sister. He forgets he is undercover, wrecks their final heist and lets the leader go in the end, throwing his job away. But Point Break has seriousness and depth to it. There was an effort into understanding the culture of risking life for thrills rather than merely exploiting it.<br /><br />TFATF was deliberately designed to appeal to the lowest common denominator. Every single element of this film has been reduced to bottom standard to reach the target demographic of braindead, but impressionable teenage wasteland. Don't be fooled. This film is la scum de la scum.<br /><br />The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound and loads of fluff extras.
B000000LZV|5.0|for the uninitiated, this double album squeezes 43 songs into 74 minutes. and they're all classics...except for the few that are obviously filler. an essential underground album of the 80's.  <br /> <br />after living with it for a few years, the thing that continues to amaze and impress me is how organic the songs sound. no over-blown guitar chords or feedback, no stadium-sized drums. just fast and loose and bright. i love to listen to this record when i'm trying to motivate myself to exercise...it's especially valuable when i'm driving to mountain biking destinations. go figure.
B00006879E|5.0|i'm going to keep this review short and straight to the point. Maroon 5 is the greatest rock band i have ever heard since Nirvana. I grew up listening to all rap and hip hop but because of these guys (especially the lead singers amazingly unique voice) i have accepted Rock into my cd collection. I haven't purchased this yet but I have heard almost all the songs. My favourites are &quot;She will be loved&quot;, &quot;sweetest goodbye&quot; and of course the song that attracted my to rock &quot;this love&quot;<br />ROCK ON MAROON 5! I WILL GET THIS CD VERY SOON (exactly 3 days) and will not hesitate for a second to get your album after this one.
0385336810|4.0|A great premise. Woman on lurching plane nervously blabs all she feels guilty about to her seatmate, a perfect stranger, only to find out later that he owns the company she works for. This book was fun and thought-provoking (honesty is the best policy, and while it would be difficult to tell a friend you don't like the gifts they give you, but Emma's fibs were out of control. I had just a minimum of trouble understanding British terminology (I'm not going to say I can't understand English!) The ending was especially cute. I was, however, let down by Jack's Big Secret, which to me wasn't any big deal. <br /> <br />I notice that many readers who've read the Shopaholic series expressed disappointment in this book. I haven't read the series yet, but I intend to. I'm looking forward to it.  From the reviews I've read I might like these even better!
B000005RFQ|4.0|Many critics tore this album apart when it first came out. True, this new Sabbath lineup wasn't the most well thoughtout endeavor, but it was good while it lasted. This is still probably Sabbath's heaviest album ever. The mix is a little bass heavy, but that's just the way it goes. I saw them on this tour and I thought they put on a damn good show, even with Ian Gillan banging on his bongo drums. The stonehenge set was really cool. Now the album. &quot;Trashed&quot; is a great opener, with Gillan's screaching vocals and Iommi's awesome riffs. Gillan adapted to this style of music pretty well I think. &quot;Stonehenge&quot; is a nice, haunting instrumental, with keyboards courtesy of longtime keyboardist, Geoff Nicholls, who, amazingly, stayed with Sabbath from 1980 right up to the Ozzy reunion, even when all others left. Then there's the heaviest Sabbath track ever-&quot;Disturbing the Priest&quot;. Gillan just screams his ass off here, as well as doing some more quieter vocals to match the slower parts of the song. This song really is so heavy & evil sounding, that your window might blow out if you play it loud enough. Then there's the scary & demonic instrumental &quot;The Dark&quot;, with great bass effects courtesy of the master, Geezer Butler. It leads into the only real &quot;classic&quot; of the album (the only classic according to some stupid critics that is), &quot;Zero the Hero&quot;. I'm still not sure what the song is about, but the riffs here are truly heavy and powerful. The other songs on here are not quite up to the standards set on the first five, but they're ok. The strong ones are &quot;Digital Bitch&quot; and &quot;Hot Line&quot;, two pretty loud & aggressive songs. But &quot;Keep it Warm&quot; and &quot;Born Again&quot; are kind of weak, especially Gillan's vocals on &quot;Born...&quot;. It sounds kind of like he had no idea what to do with his vocals. They really sound forced. But the muisc is descent. Also, Bill Ward played on the album, but soon left because he was way too drunk & stoned or something, so he was replaced for the tour by E.L.O.s Bev Bevan. Hmm. Deep Purple. Black Sabbath. And E.L.O. Strange. The album may not have been their best, but it was heavy as hell. It was a nice attempt. Too bad the lineup didn't stay together. Who knows what album #2 would have been like.
B0000AUHPG|3.0|This movie is extremely good looking, filled with beautiful landscapes and beautiful shots. But in my opinion as a movie it failed miserably with far too many long drawn out scenes. The movie felt incrediably sloooow...  After seeing the special edition of \\"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\\" I had to see this film since some have refered to this being Sergio Leone's better work. After watching it I strongly disagree. Both movies are long yet \\"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\\" never seemed to get bogged down. The cast Jason Robards, Henry Fonda, Charles Bronson just do not compare to Eli Wallach, Lee Van Cleef or Clint Eastwood. THE HARMONICA! Like many things in this film is overdone and ends up becoming ANNOYING. This film is over directed. What a disapointment after seeing Sergio Leone's real masterpiece \\"The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly\\"
B000002KAT|5.0|here's what i said then: &quot;this one scored only a 4 because i've heard moondance, which i like a little better...hard to compare the two, though...they are entirely different albums.&quot;  <br />  <br /> three years later, astral weeks has left moondance in the dust. it's become my favorite &quot;morning&quot; record, exactly what i want to hear upon waking up, a soundtrack to the rising sun (it works equally well in winter and summer). as a matter of fact, it's pretty much left everything in the dust, it's meandering, formless, acoustic beauty growing and growing and growing on me until eventually it became one of my very favorite records, period. it's a pity van morrison left this unique musical/aesthetic style behind so quickly.
B0001GL3KE|2.0|Poor story line. Some great actors & actresses but i was disappointed in the quality. I won't buy before viewing a DVD again
0060922583|5.0|While I had interest and understanding of many of the concepts of this book, I had no idea what I was getting into. The holographic model of the universe seems capable of explaining nearly everything we experience within it's framework. Definitely worth reading if you enjoy understanding the impossible.
B00005JMJG|5.0|&quot;Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind&quot; is surely the best film this year. It allows you to image what would be like if you could remove part of your unwanted memory, and at the same time it will let your imagination deal with the damage that comes along with it. The movie itself is not a science fiction or anything close to it, but I would call it a diferent kind of drama. The story that unfolds in front of you is just a way of conveying and important message, which is whether you are able to learn from previous desastreous experiences and because of that grow, or if you would rather avoid your own &quot;demons from the past&quot;. The idea that all of us need to have had bad experiences that led to the development of who you are at the present time is a bit strange and would make anyone feel unconfortable. What if that works the same way with human relationships. The fact that &quot; Whithin me you will find yourself&quot; might sound very strange, but in fact it just might be true. Watch this film with an open mind and try to figure out how much you depend upon your past memories in order to get things right at this point of your life. The movie is amazing at this point, as it will let you feel like you are the main character, and by doing that, you will end up diging your own memories and remainding yourself how important they are to you. Don't miss that chance of watching this brilliant movie...You will never forget it.
B000002MU3|2.0|the most popular bargain bin album of all time!  <br /> <br />why? well, simply, it's just not a very good album. in fact, it's the same record that made me hate the band for a few years before i started listening to their earlier stuff (well, that, and the fact that i grew up in macon georgia, and REM was everywhere you turned). but it was 5 bucks as well, and there are at least 4 quality tracks on here, so i picked it up.
B00008EY65|3.0|HELLBOY features great cinematography and film-making elements and has a GREAT first 30 minutes.... but after that it just sort of plods along as a half-hearted mix of comedy, drama, lovestory, hero comic story.<br /><br /> I was not familair with the cult popularity of the HELLBOY comic before this movie.<br /><br /> In general I don't like the way Hollywood throws so much COMEDY into hero movies.<br /><br /> I would like to see a &quot;comedy free&quot; Hero adaption one day.<br /><br /> It seems Hollywood likes to toss comedy into every type of movie these days... Horror, Action, Hero, etc...<br /><br /> It's a good rental and is better than many films these days.<br /><br /> I respect the work and effort that went into making the film, BUT I will probably never watch it again or add it to my permanent DVD collection.<br /><br /> It just didn't grab me enough to watch again or to remember.
0671027387|2.0|Okay, I'll first come out and say this novel didn't grab me like any of Brown's other novels did. It seemed to take an awfully long time to get to the payoff, and when that payoff came, it was a bit paltry.<br />Mike and Rachel and (maybe) Gabrielle were the only characters who were more than cardboard cut-outs (Sedgewick Sexton was particularly quarter-dimensional). And the storyline was just silly in places...that Milne ice shelf escape was pure schlock.<br />Now, I recognize this next is pure nitpicking, but and longtime voractious reader will tell you that the most niggling details gotten wrong can jar you completely out of the story.<br />There's a pont where Herney is about to give his Presidential address. We are told that 'Canadian National Radio' is picking up faint signals. Umm, Dan? You've set a chunk of your story in Canada. I can live with the fact that our government is not mentioned once, as Americans *do* have this nasty habit of just taking over other countries' land and airspace whenever it suits them, but...can you maybe take the time to ascertain whether such a thing as 'Canadian National Radio' exists? If you had simply written 'CBC', I would not have bolted upright and wondered what *else* you'd gotten wrong.<br />What saves this book from the dreaded one-star rating is Brown's writing. He does have an undeniable ability. The best thrillers, like Brown's own ANGELS AND DEMONS and most of Preston and Child's output, catapult you along until you're unaware you're reading. This one kind of pulled me along in stits and farts. If you're looking to kill time, by all means pick this up. But more intelligent and much better thrillers are out there...and this author has written three of them.
B00006879E|3.0|I heard a few songs on the radio so I had to go out and get the cd. big mistake. theres only about two good songs on it. its kinda nice because its different than all the stuff thats out there right now. the only good songs are: This Love, Secret and Harder to breathe.
B000002LVB|4.0|here's what i said then: &quot;wow, i actually like a velvets album. wow, i actually bought a velvets album. wow, i actually listened to a velvets album. this is my initiation into the world of lou reed, and i must say i like it very much. but i know and fear that the rest of their catalogue is nowhere near as accessible as this set of easy-listening rock songs.&quot;  <br />  <br /> turns out i don't like it quite as much as the self-titled album, and it isn't as intriguing as white light/white heat, and not as groundbreaking as the debut, but it's probably my second favorite, based solely on the simple, pure strength of the songs. lou knew rock 'n' roll. this album proved it.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This was the second movie I have seen that was directed by Hayo Miyazaki.  The first was The Castle of Cagliostro (considered by many, including me, to be one of the greatest adventure movies of all time).  This movie was easily on the same level of The Castle of Cagliostro.  Miyazaki manages to develop realistic characters that refuse to be classified as either good or bad, like so many other Disney films. <br /> <br />That being said I find it hard to believe that Miyazaki intended for this to be a children's movie.  It does incorporate the some of typical Disney children's themes into it but much of the movie I think would be too \\"scary\\" for children.  For instance, the desperately lonely character No-Face seems compassionate at first but then proceeds to eat several people.  No-Face later realizes that Chihiro only wanted to be his friend and joins her in her journey.  Even Haku, the only person that wanted to help Chihiro in the spirit world, is revealed as a thief that was only using Yubaba to gain power.  The images themselves are what nightmares are made of.  One scene in particular after they bathe the \\"stink spirit\\" I found particularly creepy.  In the scene a floating skull appears in the air and says \\"well done.\\" <br /> <br />This is a must see for any fan of anime. <br />
B000003S0P|5.0|I've been around a long time and listened to In the Court of the Crimson King countless times. Unbeknownest to me, I strayed and got away from this incredible band. There were so many changes within the band I though they disbanded. I just recently got RED, listened to it three times and and was blown out of my chair. The technical prowess of these three musicians is mind-bending. Words can not really justify this album. I would like to say; I hear a heavy jazz infusion, rock and classical gelled into an awesome sound. Some might think I'm insane, but I can hear the Mahvishnu Orchestra (Birds of Fire) and Miles Davis's horn. Incorporating the horns into this album was absolute genius. King Crimson, now without a doubt, is my favorite band in this genre. Pink Floyd a close second. Enough said, just listen.
B00005PJ8O|5.0|Updated for new \\"Patton\\" Blu-ray remaster:<br /><br />The previous edition was awash in heavy use of digital noise reduction which often make fine detail look smeared on the screen particularly on a larger plasma or LCD. The remaster (which features George C. Scott against the background of an American flag full face vs. the previous Blu master which had a white background with only half of Scott's face visible--the digibook edition is also the older master as is the edition in this packagePatton / Longest Day / Sand Pebbles / Tora Tora [Blu-ray])looks marvelous--the film grain looks natural and grain is consistent from scene to scene. Fine detail is much improved especially skin textures although keep in mind this will never look quite as sharp or as detailed as a current film, it looks darn good for its age. Fox did a exceptional job on remastering this and made sure to only use minimal edge enchacement and digital noise reduction tastefully.<br /><br />War is hell. More importantly, war is hell for those whose very lives are defined by it. The late George C. Scott brings Patton to life in a way that few actors could have. A West Point graduate who believed he was the reincarnation of Alexander The Great, Patton focuses on the character of the man and his obsessive rivalry with \\"Monty\\" his British counterpart. Patton comes across as a gunslinger in modern warfare believing that the code of conduct for a soldier in battle should be respected regardless of which side you're on and, of course, his side should always be the winning side.<br /><br />Francis Ford Coppola co-wrote the perceptive screenplay (and shared an Oscar for it although he never worked with is co-writer the late Edmund H. North. The two wrote separate drafts one of which incorporated information from the memoir of General Omar Bradley)and the talented late director Franklin J. Schaffner (\\"Planet of the Apes\\", \\"The Warlord\\")fashioned his directorial masterpiece from the material he had at hand. Brilliantly filmed with sharp, powerful support performances (particularly from the talented Karl Malden), \\"Patton\\" remains one of the best films about an individual involved in a massive war and what drove him to try and be the best.<br /><br />The special features are largely confined to the second disc a standard DVD (although we do get an entertaining commentary track from Coppola who notes throughout material that he wrote vs. North and how they compliment each other in the final version). We also get an interesting and lively introduction by Coppola on the first disc as well.<br /><br />The second disc includes an excellent documentary \\"The Making of 'Patton'\\" from 1997. We also get \\"Patton's Ghost Corps\\" which covers Patton's campagins. The Ken Burns 2000 documentary \\"History Through The Lens: Patton-The Rebel Revisited\\" is an exceptional overview of the man and the mythology that surrounded him both when he was alive and after death.

B000005IRG|5.0|maybe the most guitar-saturated album i own, definitely one of the few i really, really like. when you consider what most of the CBGB crowd was up to in the mid-to-late 70s where television got their start, their sound is just amazing. how in the hell did they end up sounding like this?! it's unfortunate they didn't have a longer career...they could have gone fantastic places had they allowed this sound to mature and evolve. doubtful that they would ever have topped this meandering masterpiece, but all the same, i'd have liked to hear it...
6305508550|5.0|I thought that this movie was very funny before I ever worked in an office but now that I have I think it is absolutely hilarious. Almost every character in this movie has a real life counterpart in my office. It?s comforting to know that my office is not the only one that has a Nina, Tom Smykowski, Drew, Milton, and Bill Lumbergh working in it.
B00004R99U|1.0|Historical inaccuracies aside.....was there any need for a second movie? <br />Frankly, this is right up there with Sister Act II as far as unnecessary sequels go. <br />If I were you, I'd spend my afternoon or evening going for a walk or reading a good book instead.  You'll appreciate the memories. <br /> <br />That's all.
0385247125|4.0|If you want to know something about anybody it seems their account would be preferable to another biographer. &quot;Moonwalker&quot; is authored by the man everyone desires to learn about. For this reason alone it deserves to be read by any Michael Jackson fan. It does a great job revealing the real Michael Jackson, and it's the closest any of his fans will ever get to actually talking to him. The only thing that degrades this book is the simplicity in which it is written (I read this 200+ page book in 4 days), I would have been delighted if Michael chose to write with a little more inventiveness and creative zest, something I'm sure he is capable of; perhaps not now, but then in 1988.
B000002513|5.0|everything about this record is a yes. everything in rock 'n' roll that is right and good blasts out of these songs like gamma rays. or something (i'm a music fan, not a scientist). bruce has had one hell of a career, but he never released anything as gleeful and life-affirming and block-rocking as this splendid album.
B00003CXCD|5.0|Despite being in black and white, Roman Holiday is anything but boring. It's the story of the Princess Anna of an unknown European country who goes on an exhausting European goodwill tour. Tired of royal life and being a royal pain (in other words a spoiled child), Anna (played by the sparkling actress, Audrey Hepburn) escapes into the city of Rome. There she meets Joe Bradley, a foreign news reporter from America, who mistakes her for being drunk and tries to take her back home. Unsuccessful, he, trying hard to be a gentleman, loans her his couch to sleep on for the night, not knowing she's a princess. Joe, (played to perfection by Gregory Peck)upon discovering she's a princess, sees a chance to make some money and boost his career. He takes her on the ultimate romantic tour of the Eternal City, never expecting to fall in love with the dainty, beautiful girl. The story is pretty predictable, but is one of the most romantic older screenplays I've ever seen. This is one of those really good movies that makes you want to cry at the end. You'll fall in love with Audrey Hepburn, Gregory Peck, and all the delightful characters of Roman Holiday, I guarantee.
B00003CXS4|2.0|Nothing special really,a strange depicition of londoners (i dont know anyone and have never met anyone like the people in guy ritchies films).I know its just a movie but lock stock and two smoking barrels was cheesey aswell every cliche in the book is used. <br /> <br />   Rent or buy sexy beast
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series was practically unadvertised, shown out of order, pre-empted frequently and finally canceled before completing its first season. Why? Because the network execs had their heads firmly wedged in very dark, uncomfortable places. <br />  <br /> Ever since it got canceled, I've been hoping against hope for some kind of miracle. This DVD set was the first part of that miracle. The upcoming movie, &quot;Serenity,&quot; due in the Summer of 2005, is the second. If you don't see this series before that movie comes out, you are going to miss out on one of the best sci-fi adventures to hit the big or small screens. You can't EVEN be planning to shell out your hard-earned money for the next Star Wars ripoff and not see &quot;Serenity&quot; . . . can you? No, I'll answer that: You can't.  <br />  <br /> &quot;What's the big deal,&quot; you ask? Ok, look, I'll tell you straight up -- this is a space western. Yes. There are spaceships in the skies and cattle rustlers on the ground. Does that sound cheesy? Well, it did to me, but then I saw the first episode and I was hooked. The characters are so fascinating, the dialogue so witty, the situations so interesting, I just can't get enough of this show. Literally. It could be about space turnip farmers and I would love it. The reason for the rustic living conditions is kind of explained, and you do get used to it. Really!  <br />  <br /> And now for the good stuff: There are no regulations-spouting goody-goodies here. Sometimes the crew does the noble thing, sometimes not. Bad guys usually get what's coming to them, whether it's &quot;the right thing to do&quot; or not. Some of the characters are mostly good, some you're not sure about, and &quot;Jayne&quot; in particular (Adam Baldwin's character) is so thoroughly rotten and untrustworthy, you want to kill him, but he's so annoyingly FUNNY you'd hate it if he were gone. I came to love EVERY character, even Jayne, and yet there is always the real possibility a main character will bite the dust. The dialogue is so good, every episode is like a favorite book you regret finishing. That's Good Writing. <br />  <br /> But hey, who am I? If I can't convince you to buy the DVD set, at least borrow someone else's and watch one episode. That should do it. If you do get hooked, like I did, do your part to spread the word. I've turned two people on to Firefly, and maybe they'll tell others. Most people I mention it to NEVER heard of it. That's a crying shame. (My fingers are crossed for the third part of the miracle -- a revival of the series on a smarter network. It COULD happen.)
B00009TB5G|5.0|This review is for LOTR as a whole, not just The Two Towers.  I can't say enough good things about the job Peter Jackson & co. did with this series.  The actors, the special effects, the story lines, etc., all top-notch.  Of course, Tolkien did the hard part on the story line, but Jackson's adaptation is terrific. <br /> <br />If you're going to buy a copy of this, make sure you get the extended version of all 3 movies (Return of the King comes in November).  Well worth the price and the wait. <br /> <br />The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy will become a standard by which future movies are judged.  Looking forward to PJ's version of The Hobbit a couple years down the road.
6305537321|2.0|Although I'm a big fan of Audrey Hepburn this movie wasn't very good. I had heard about it for the longest time and finally watched it with my mom. She left halfway through the movie, and I stayed (being a devout believer in finishing movies no matter how bad). Mickey Rooney's part, I must say, was excellent and so very funny. He had me laughing so hard. Audrey plays the misplaced Holly Golightly, not belonging anywhere it seems. However, unlike other movies, she had no real purpose in this movie, except to keep the action going. Her mood swings are what threw me off. Nevertheless, her wardrobe is simply ravishing. I like how she befriends her upstairs neighbor, whom she endearingly calls Fred after her brother. The movie gives her a &quot;bad girl&quot; image, which really isn't the Audrey Hepburn I know. One minute she likes you, adores you, even seems to love you, and the next she hates you for wanting to get close to her. The movie has no real depth, although it brushes issues such as prostitution, drugs, and other illegal activities. And the movie title really has nothing to do with the movie. A brief scene at the beginning with her eating in front of the store really doesn't cut it, despite her obsession with Tiffany's and her later entrance into the building. I will say that Audrey does has style, but no class in this movie portrayal. And what's style without class? The concept of the story was annoying, odd, and downright confusing. You never know what to expect from her character, and from Peppard's for that matter. The DVD features are okay ie. languages, special features, etc. This movie is not one I'd recommend, but it's definitely a unique plot.
B00008CMR6|4.0|I'll make this short and sweet. Lobo has an affectionate place in my heart. Yes it's the third time we've seen this movie, Bravo and El Dorado are basically the same thing, except they're better overall. BUT, Lobo is so much damn fun. I used to watch it with my grandfather and we'd die laughing at many of the film's fine comedic elements. Jennifer O'Neill is awful, but so cute, Elam is fine as usual, Victor French is slightly wasted but also good - etc. etc. Duke is... well playing a part he could do in his sleep, but he is none the less likable and funny &quot;don't say COMFORTABLE&quot;. And the true star of the film is without doubt, Jerry Goldsmith's score. It only clocks in at around 40 minutes worth of music. BUT, oh what a great 40 minutes they are. For Jerry's score and the film's wonderful comedic underpinnings, I have no choice but to say it's a keeper!
B0001ADAVK|5.0|It was amazing and captivating and the cast was just unbelivable. It just worth the time.. It's just amazing
B000002HD5|5.0|<br /> I went to a local music store and bought this album on tape for 50 cents. After listening to it I felt like crying. I touched me soooo much.I loved it soooooo much.

B000002LJW|4.0|I am a huge Clapton fan, so there is nothing by him that I really dislike... however, I find that this album works best as &quot;background music&quot; -- great if you're running, at work, etc. since it is a little bit more in the &quot;popular music&quot; realm than his typical stuff.
B00008OLYN|5.0|Opeth may not be a known band but once you get to experience them you won't forget it this album alone is musically impressive beyond explanation without a doubt one of the best albums out today even if it isnt played on radio frequently its still great trust me would i let you down i know rock music its my second lover first would be my hand but thats besides the point get this and just rock out

B00006L3S3|5.0|Though all of the songs on here are very well-crafted, solid, and tight, it's not the kind of album I'd recommend to a new fan. This is the type of album that, while great, is great in an underrated type of way and thus isn't as instantaneously beloved and favourably received by most new fans. It's just one of those albums that the average listener has to listen to several times before fully grasping its genius and really starting to like it.<br /><br /> The best-known songs on here are the title track and &quot;Freda People&quot;; the other songs, while great, just aren't as well-known. Other standout songs on this album are &quot;Meat City&quot; (an awesome rocker), &quot;Intuition,&quot; &quot;Only People&quot; (which John later said didn't really work like he'd envisioned it would), and &quot;Tight A$.&quot; Most of the rest of the songs are about his love for Yoko, like &quot;I Know (I Know),&quot; &quot;Aisumasen (I'm Sorry)&quot; (which he sings in an unnaturally high falsetto), &quot;One Day (At a Time),&quot; &quot;Out the Blue,&quot; and &quot;You Are Here.&quot; The remaining &quot;song&quot; is &quot;Nutopian National Anthem,&quot; which I didn't understand the meaning of until I found out that it was supposed to be three seconds of silence, because of a letter John and Yoko sent Nixon, saying that they were Nutopians. At least it's not as weird or as long as &quot;Two Minutes' Silence&quot; on their experimental album 'Life with Lions.'<br /><br /> These songs may not all be fan favourites, classics, or critically-acclaimed songs, but it does sound as though John had a lot of fun singing and recording these songs.
B00008BXJ6|5.0|Ok first off if you never heard of Ac/Dc then wake up and get outside....Ac/Dc are Rock Legends and are one of the very best bands of all-time High Voltage their first American Release features some of their best songs this is not an album to pass up in this remastered classic you get the grooving hardcore headbanging (Its a long way to the top if you want to rock n roll) and the explosive T.N.T. and don't forget Can I Sit Next To You girl which has one of the most catchy guitar riffs around those are only 3 of the songs off this classic that i am talking about the rest is up too you get this album awesome awesome stuff
B00028HBKM|5.0|Regarding the moron who wrote about \\"madman on the corner\\" are you freaking insane? The story has nothing to do with Jesus soul being more worthy than any others. It's called the Passion (suffering) of Christ, what did you expect? Jesus getting together with Donkey to find Shrek? If you knew anything about Christianity which you apparently don't you may have looked at it differently. If you are going to knock a movie because it's bad is one thing otherwise try to give it an objective opinion instead of a misleading one. Here is a concept, if the movie is about a subject you don't like...DON'T WATCH IT! That simple, no one is holding a gun to your head forcing you to watch. Free will, wonderful thing that was given to us.   Mel Gibson is a fantastic filmaker and you can see his love for making this movie in every shot he filmed. It is difficult to watch based on seeing a man we love tortured but it's why he was that makes the DEPTH of the movie woth seeing.

B00003CXXM|4.0|I have never been a Matt  Damon fan. For some reason, he just never blipped on my radar screen until I saw The Bourne Identity in the theaters two years ago. My new found crush for him has now been solidified with The Bourne Supremacy. I realized he is such a good actor who can play an action character with humanity and be athletic enough to pull off the action moves with ease. <br /> <br />I think the Bourne series overall is a smart intelligent piece of filmmaking with a solid screenplay and razor sharp caliber actors. Cooper and especially Cox are my favorite. I enjoy the relationship between Bourne and Marie. Call me a romantic mush but how could they not have went with the alternative ending. The theatrical ending never made sense to me. It came off stiff and implausible. Bourne has been searching the globe for the woman he loves. When they finally reunite, they act as if they're old friends catching up, giving each other nice generic hugs. The alternative ending makes more sense. The raw passion and hunger they feel for each other comes through. It marks the incredible ordeal they've both endured. He was so incredible in that screen, he really acted a man who wanted to devour his woman. <br /> <br />For those who are not romantic like me, the Bourne Identity mainly focuses on the spy thriller that is heavily character driven and it will not disappoint. If they continue to make more films I hope that stick to the commitment of making a great screenplay with a director who can pull it off and not turn the series into garbage like James Bond.

B0000AQVCL|5.0|I love this band! i usually listen to punk so this CD is really different from the other bands i listen too. I saw them live in concert and they were pretty good. Nic does his &quot;yells&quot; like he does on the record. I honestly can say i like all of the songs. i think they are up-beat and i feel very happy and energetic when i listen to them. Even their slow songs keep my interest, which most CDs fail to do.  <br /> I'm not going to rate any of the songs because i love them all.  <br />  <br /> One thing to note is their lyrics, which are interesting. i dont know, i wouldnt call some of them shallow, but rather honest. they're definatly dont express the most intelligent thoughts, but it works. if you hear their songs and wanna know what they're singing about go to [...] and type in Jet in the search. check it out. there seems to be a lot of dispute over lyrics on these reviews.... <br />  <br /> but all in all, i think they're great and have really good energy. i know i'll be a fan for a long time. if you wanna check out a live performance, they are scheduled to be on MTV2 August 3rd at 10:30. later folks

0385510438|3.0|As John D. MacDonald writes: &quot;Story. Story. Dammit, story! Story is something that happens to someone you have been led to care about.&quot; Don't look for that here. The Last Juror does nothing so much as suggest an author with a contract to deliver x number of books and needing to fill pages. There is no thrill here and little mystery, and when the mystery is revealed it is a writing cop out, not a natural evolution of story and character. Grisham writes a three-part novel: in the first he relates a horrible crime and boring trial (with none of the skills we have come to expect in these areas); then, in an interlude, Grisham writes &quot;My Little Town, Mississippi,&quot; essentially an authorial look at laws and culture in small town Mississippi; he then returns to the story he started with and tries to rekindle interest. There is no one to be interested in here and no suspense. He generated more suspense in the first ten pages of A Time to Kill than this entire book. <br />  <br /> I'm not holding Grisham to previous standards to say he should never change as a writer. But for a proven commercial writer and a proven storyteller, this is not a solid effort. It reads like a writer with writer's block, boredom, or detachment. I picture an agent saying, &quot;We need another lawyer book&quot; and Grisham saying, &quot;I want to write about other things,&quot; and the result is a subpar concoction of both. <br />  <br /> The saving grace is Grisham's writing ability, which is still up there among commercial fiction writing. He is always readable, something that can't be said of all top-selling fiction writers.

B0002KVUKM|4.0|Don't go into this film expecting oscar material. If you throw this movie on with the expectation of a fun remix of old monster movies with much improved effects, then you are going to love it!<br /><br /> Stephen Sommers does it again. If you liked &quot;The Mummy&quot;, you are going to love &quot;Van Helsing&quot;. Beginning with the most famous scene for the original &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, this film dives into all the old favorite monster movies combined into one story. There are quite a few scenes with the &quot;Yeah, right...&quot; factor (such as the automatic &quot;machine gun&quot; crossbow, and the horsedrawn carrage jumping a destroyed 50' span of bridge), but like I say, as with many of the '50's movie, if you just turn off your brain and enjoy this film for what it is, you are going to have a good time. The effects are great, and the story is about a &quot;B&quot; rating. IF you are a fan of old monster movies like myself, this film is well worth the price. If you are one of those geeks that likes to pick apart everything, or is expecting &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; grade story material to accompany the top notch special effects, you may want to skip it. This is a Summer(Sommer) fun movie, noting more, nothing less.
0345413377|1.0|*** caution spoilers ahead!***<br /><br />HUH!? Did I miss something here? After reading this book, I was so sure that I missed some fine point of Pullman's subtlety that I reread portions of the book. But no, I was left with far more questions than the story could answer. What was all that spiel about Lyra being destined to be tempted like Eve? Supposedly this temptation would have been so horrible that the Church dispatches an assassin to kill the tempter and/or tempted. At the end of the scene where Lyra and Will are in the boat heading towards the underworld and Pan is left behind, there was a sly little mention that the first part of the prophesy was fulfilled. And what was this prophesy?? I honestly don't think anyone knows.<br /><br /> There are lots of loose ends, abrupt character changes, and completely useless characters that bogs down this story. Are we to believe a simple little tale of how Mary meets her first love over a dish of marzipan completely altered the fate of the universe? That Lyra was tempted into loving Will just because she remembers this tale? The sudden romance between these two are disturbing because 1) It came completely out of the blue ( up until then, there was no way of guessing that the temptation would be love); 2) This book was marketed towards children whose knowledge of true love is non-existent ( other than their love for their parents or toys); 1) Will and Lyra are children themselves and I find it hard to believe that they suddenly discovered they were each other's soul mate. In any case there is no happy resolution to this prophesy.<br /><br /> My other main problem is Pullman's use of characters. Was Mary really a tempter? Was she even necessary in this tale? Her little adventure with the mulefa was interesting, but unrelated to the main plot and contributed nothing. Even the title invention, the amber spyglass, is useless, simply restating the fact that dust does exist. The Gallivespians were a mere distraction to me, the witches outlived their usefulness, and the angels were over hyped considering there is never a display of their power. Most frustrating were Lyra's parents. In the first book you're led to believe that Mrs. Coulter is evil and Lord Asriel, though just as evil, is worth helping. Then all of a sudden, the are caring parents invested in the protection of Lyra, even sacrificing themselves to \\"save\\" her ( how this helps her in the long run is unclear, especially since she never learns her parents are dead). The constant love-hate relationship between Coulter and Asriel was confusing and tedious. In the end, it was just easier to kill them off and not explain why ( Pullman seems to have a habit of killing off excess characters). And why on earth was it so important that Will and Lyra go to the world of the dead to see Roger? To apologize?! They suffered the supposedly agonizing pain of separating from their daemons so Lyra could get over her guilt issues? Will didn't even speak to his father for all that long! So many things wrong with this last book, which is sad because the first book was extraordinary.lived their usefulness, and the angels were over hyped considering there is never a display of their power.

B0001Z52RU|2.0|This movie had a lot of potential, but somewhere along the way, fell way short of expectations. Everyone was interested in seeing Kutcher in a more serious role and he did very well, along with the rest of the cast.  The problem stemmed more from plot holes and a lack of connection to reality. The idea is cool, the guy can basically warp his brain and memories from when he was younger to alter the present, but in the end it seemed very rushed and went in to many different directions before ending at a heaping mess of an ending. <br /> <br />I wanted to like this movie, and parts were kind of neat, but in the end, more time should have been spent reconstructing the script so that it could have been a much more intelligent movie and a real winner at the box office.
B00028HBKM|5.0|It seems the reviews of this film are quite polarized. This is simply an amazing piece of cinema in my opinion. Not so much a movie as it is an experience. I felt as if I had been through the ringer, emotionally by the end. And, after all, isn't that what great movies do? Make you feel. Honestly, I don't know what a non-Christian will take away from seeing this film. It simply SHOWS you in honest terms what the gospels were only able to TELL you.  <br />  <br /> It grabs you from the very first scene and although there are flashbacks and means of escape from the mental and emotional strain of watching the events unfold in chronological order, this movie is as unrelenting in it's drive to tell the story as I believe Christ was in accomplishing his mission in the final hours of his life on earth.  <br />  <br /> If you are familiar with the story and watch with an open mind, I think you will be as moved as the others were who saw it in the theater with me. Simply an amazing and moving work. I know many who see it from strictly a secular point of view won't &quot;get it&quot; but to those of the Christian faith, or anyone who enjoys a good, moving cinema experience, this DVD will certainly be a must-have. Believe it or not, it actually has a happy ending. Simply, a film you will not soon forget.
B000069KGM|5.0|I did not like the lightweight, pop, elevator music style that Chicago evolved into. However on this album, as the Chicago Transit Authority, they gave us, in my opinion, one of the best albums ever made by anybody in any genre. I have owned this album for 25 years and have recently rediscovered it. I can't come up with the words to do it justice, you just have to hear it for yourself. As a guitar player, I have a special appreciation for Terry Kath's guitar work. Despite all the accolades thrown on &quot;Free Form Guitar&quot; (which is quite intense), it is on the live track &quot;Liberation&quot; that I feel he really shines. But the whole album is just incredible from start to finish. Double LP debut albums were almost unheard of in the 1960's (&quot;Freak Out&quot; by The Mothers of Invention is the only other one I know of); this debut justifies every minute.

Johnny drives a cab and continually auditions for acting jobs, while they live in squalor in a slum in New York.  Their love for one another is undeniable, but they still cannot put the death of their son behind them.  Their older daughter Christie is constantly filming their life with her camcorder and their younger daughter Ariel is beguiling with her sweet innocence amidst the squalor of their surroundings.  The girls go trick-or-treating on Halloween and are greeted by silence until they knock on the door of Mateo, a young black artist whose desire for privacy seems to be an obsession.  The young girls win him over, and soon he is a friend of the whole Sullivan family.  The acting by all cast members is superb and the story is poignant and compelling.  This is recommended viewing!
0316926345|5.0|This is the first Evelyn Waugh book I have read, on recommendation.  'Brideshead Revisited' is an extremely well-written book that thoroughly tells the story of Charles Ryder, an English officer who is forced to recall the happiest and saddest moments of his life.  Through his memories, we learn of the wealthy and eccentric Marchmain family and the formative role they played in the narrator's life.<br /><br />Charles Ryder begins his memoirs when, as a soldier in WWII, he finds himself requisitioning the old manor home of the Marchmain family.  He immediately recalls his first encounters with the family - the mysterious and ultra-stylish Sebastian, whom he encounters while at Oxford, a pretentious young man who carries around a stuffed bear and has a propensity to drink.  Sebastian is hesitant to introduce Charles to his family, for fear they will charm him so much that he will lose him as a friend for himself.  But Charles does meet, and is charmed by, the Marchmain family, ingratiating himself into every aspect of their life.  He quickly becomes a mainstay with the family and is called upon in times of great stress - when Sebastian's propensity to drink gets him expelled and causes him to escape his demons by running away.  Despite losing his friend, through the years, Charles remains connected with the Marchmains in varying degrees of intimacy.<br /><br />'Brideshead Revisited' is a stylish and well-written saga of one man's journey to discover himself; he seeks out what he desires in others, and at the end of his journey is brought to tears by his remembrances of everything he has lost.  The novel is not only a family saga, but also raises deep questions of faith, especially pertaining to Catholicism.  As an agnostic, Charles ridicules the Marchmain's devout adherence to a faith system he finds mystical; and in the end, he must lose the Marchmain family because he cannot reconcile himself to their system of beliefs.  Charles would rather find his own system of beliefs, exactly what he's been searching for throughout the entire novel, seeking it through school, painting, and relationships, but to no avail.of beliefs, exactly what he's been searching for throughout the entire novel, seeking it through school, painting, and relationships, but to no avail.

B0002KVUKM|4.0|...but lots of fun. The movie was good, not awesome, but really a fun watch. They did jump the shark - without giving away the plot points, the bit where Van Helsing howls near the end.... yech. <br /> <br />But anyway, for me, Dracula made the movie worth going to see for a second time. Campy - yes, dramatic - yes.... I'm not going to write a big long literary review of why the Dracula character worked the way it did because everyone has their opinions, suffice to say he got my thumbs up :)
B00005Y7GQ|3.0|Many others have reviewed this film pretty well here. I think they're pretty accurate -- it's a fantastic film. I'll just mention the subtitles here, on the import version. Someone else seemed to like them a lot (finding them humorous), but I thought the fairly bad translation to English was distracting. Too much of it was in the vein of &quot;All your base are belong to us.&quot; I'll be looking into the U.S. version when it's released on DVD, which I assume will have a better translation.
B00028HBKC|5.0|A wonderful true story of our Lord. We rely on the bible to tell us the story of Jesus and this was a great opportunity to actually see what happened.

6305232660|5.0|Question: why does this movie get downgraded, bruised and discredited by Armageddon? The reason I ask is because although both movies are similar, I grant you, no way does Armageddon come CLOSE to being as good as Deep Impact. Out of the two, Deep Impact is the overwhelming better on several accounts. Firstly, there is far more realistic emotion, secondly, the special effects are so much impressive and last but certainly not least, the characters are far more believable and rememberal. <br />  <br /> now that I've cleared that up, I would like to say that although not my favourite film, Deep Impact still left a HUGE impact on me. <br />  <br /> The story follows the lives of three different people in the USA. The sofistocated and stubborn news reporter, Jenny (Tea Leoni), the powerful American President (Morgon Freeman) and the nerdy astronomy student Leo (Elijah Wood). When Leo coinsidently discovers a new &quot;star&quot; in the sky, he soon discovers that it is infact a comet the size of New York City bound for the foundations of Earth. In a race against time, the people of the world must find a way to survive the comet's formiddible onslaught and keep the slightest ray of hope that they might just survive. There is also a fourth story which focuses on a crew of astronauts stranded in Space and working against the clock to destroy as much of the astroid as possible. The different stories focus mainly on how these unique characters deal with their grief in the days leading up to dooms day. <br />  <br /> I loved Deep Impact because, as I mentioned earlier, it is very emotional and if you're anything like me, you will shead a couple of tears. The music is impressive and the special effects are excellent, considoring this film was made in 1998 when our forces of technonlogy hadn't reached the brillinace of today.  <br />  <br /> My favourite story was Leo's journey. It's very sweet and the most emotional. Elijah Wood, being just 17 at the time portrayed his character to perfection. The overall acting was great as well, but Wood really did steal the show in my eyes. <br />  <br /> But there is a side of Deep Impact that really did haunt me right into my sleep, and this is probably a good excuse not to show this to children below the age of 11. It's the realisiation that although Deep Impact is a fictional movie, it is NOT a fictional possiblity. There is every chance that this film may very well be a prophecy. Indeed, one day, Earth will be faced with its ultimate danger. <br />  <br /> I can understand that some may not like this movie, but for the record I think its a powerful wake up call to us all. And, hey! If you're looking for an excuse to get a few shivers, perhaps cry a little, or see the Statue of Liberty's head bouncing around New York, this is a great film that will leave a deep impact on you for sure!
B0002IQJUK|5.0|This CD counldn't be any hotter if Gavin DeGraw himself was folded up and put inside. Not only is his Gavin's voice powerfully moving, but his incredible use of those magic ivory ticklers will never stop amazing you. Songs like &quot;Belief&quot; and &quot;More Than Anyone&quot; come alive in a beautiful new way and make you really think about the messages Gavin is trying to deliver. &quot;Change Gonna Come&quot;, the bonus track, alone is worth the purchase of this CD. This CD is a prime example of how music should be done.

B000002BFZ|3.0|No Code(1996). Pearl Jam's Fourth Album.<br /><br /> Pearl Jam, while being one of the best-selling Rock acts of the 90's, was certainly the most creative. Some people would balk at that claim and say, &quot;But Pearl Jam is just a glorified Garage/Grunge band!&quot;, when in fact, they are dead wrong. No band since the Beatles and Led Zeppelin has deftly intermixed musical genres with such precision and beauty, and on 'No Code', Pearl Jam hits their experimental peak, with Pearl Jam exploring the music in the East and India, while still retaining their Rock sensibilities. 'No Code' was a difficult album for fans, as many highly enjoyed its experimentation, while others thought Pearl Jam had gone in a little over their heads. 'No Code' flirted breifly with the Charts, but ultimately it became a commercial bomb for Pearl Jam as it didn't garner any hit singles. I was skeptical when I picked up 'No Code', so does it best my expectations or turn out to be a fairly mediocre album like I expected? Read on to find out!<br /><br /> Track Ratings-<br /><br /> Sometimes- &quot;Sometimes&quot; is a Jazz Ballad, with Vedder harmonizing behind a placid(slow) bass beat, picking up slightly for the chorus where Vedder sings his thoughtful lyrics. Too short, and a tad boring.<br /><br /> Hail, Hail- Hail &quot;Hail, Hail&quot;! &quot;Hail, Hail&quot; is as close as Pearl Jam gets to Heavy Metal, with McCready/Gossard(Henceforth known as &quot;The Duo&quot;) spitting out a riff much like on 'Vs.'s &quot;Go&quot;, rather dark and uncompromising. Vedder's melodic, yet slightly angry, vocals fly out the speakers, and &quot;The Duo&quot;'s spontaneous solos help him along. &quot;Hail, Hail&quot; is an awesome Heavy Rocker, and one of Pearl Jam's best!<br /><br /> Who You Are- &quot;Who You Are&quot; reminds me of African Folk, yet Pearl Jam uses a catchy bass line behind Vedder's happy, light vocals, not to mention clapping, which gives you the impression you're dancing around a bonfire. An odd but ultimately rewarding song!<br /><br /> In My Tree- &quot;In My Tree&quot; is a fairly slow number, relying on Ament's punctual, up front bass line behind Vedder's deep vocals. The chorus to &quot;In My Tree&quot; picks up the song a lot, and &quot;The Duo&quot;'s guitar talents reach maximum overdrive. An interesting, good song.<br /><br /> Smile- &quot;Smile&quot; is like a Tom Petty song, except replace Tom Petty with Eddie Vedder and instead of an acoustic guitar, you've got a pulsing, distorted electric guitar. &quot;Smile&quot; combines frequent boughts of the harmonica and the Country/Alt. Rock guitar beat, not to mention Vedder's catchy vocals. Good Musicianship makes 'Smile' a good song.<br /><br /> Off He Goes- &quot;Off He Goes&quot; is a Folk/Rock ballad, blends a sweet acoustic guitar riff you'd expect around a campout fire with Vedder's soulful vocals, which almost seemed tinged with a slight Southern Drawl. Much like a Campout Fire song, &quot;Off He Goes&quot; ultimately gets a little boring, but I still think it's a good, heartfelt ballad.<br /><br /> Habit- &quot;Habit&quot;, much like &quot;Hail, Hail&quot;, is heavy as HELL! In fact, this is the heaviest Pearl Jam song period, with &quot;The Duo&quot;'s deathly/doomy riff blaring out the speakers and Vedder's usually somber vocals absolutely SCREAMing bloody murder. Absolutely awesome guitar work, and the Heavy Metal song totally rocks my world!<br /><br /> Red Mosquito- &quot;Red Mosquito&quot; starts off a little like an Eric Clapton song, with a distorted Bluesy solos placed deftly amongst the beautiful vocals of Vedder. Great guitarwork and solos, not to mention absolutely stunning vocals from Vedder!<br /><br /> Lukin- &quot;Lukin&quot; is an Odd Alt. Rocker, starting off with Vedder's pissed off, fast-talking vocals, much like a Rage Against The Machine song, except it's basically filler because it's only a minute long!<br /><br /> Present Tense- &quot;Present Tense&quot; showsVedder actually trying to have a Southern Drawl, with him lightly talking behind an almost-not-there guitar beat. Picks up later on, with some interesting India-influenced guitar beats, but most of the song you're waiting for something to happen. Bad start, good ending!<br /><br /> Mankind- &quot;Mankind&quot; is a sarcastic look at Man's Inventions, with Vedder's unusually sarcastic vocals spewing out the funny lyrics behind a chugging alternative, distorted guitar beat that totally rocks! A fun Hard Rocker, with excellent musicianship everywhere!<br /><br /> I'm Open- &quot;I'm Open&quot; is WEIRD! It gives you the experience like you've been abducted by aliens, and your subconscious thoughts are slowly pouring out of your mind(courtesy Vedder). Extremely odd, but interestingly, this song is really quite beautiful for some reason. Basically filler though!<br /><br /> Around The Bend- &quot;Around The Bend&quot; is a slow, jazzy ballad that features a subtle keyboard touch along with Vedder's brooding vocals. Good if you like Jazz, otherwise rather boring.....I fall into the second category.<br /><br /> Overall, 'No Code' has its high points(&quot;Hail, Hail&quot;, &quot;Habit&quot;, &quot;Mankind&quot;, &quot;Red Mosquito&quot;), but some tracks seem boring(Ex. &quot;Around The Bend&quot;, &quot;Sometimes&quot;, &quot;Off He Goes&quot;), and some tracks are disjointed and seem like filler(Ex. &quot;I'm Open&quot;, &quot;Present Tense&quot;, &quot;Lukin&quot;). 'No Code' isn't bad, but it's not above average either, just average. You will find some great songs, and to the &quot;big fans&quot;, they might claim I don't &quot;understand the songs&quot;, but I find some of them a bit generic and not up to par with other Pearl Jam albums. Oh well, this is Pearl Jam's worst, but it's still not bad!<br /><br /> RECOMMENDED TO FANS OF PEARL JAM, JAZZ, AND 90'S ROCK. ALTHOUGH MY LEAST FAVORITE PEARL JAM ALBUM, SOME PEOPLE MAY FAVOR IT FOR ITS CREATIVE EXPERIMENTATION!<br /><br /> Also Recommended-<br /><br /> Vs.- Pearl Jam<br /> Purple- Stone Temple Pilots<br /> Bleach- Nirvana<br /><br /> Killer Kuts- &quot;Habit&quot;, &quot;Hail, Hail&quot;, &quot;Mankind&quot;, and &quot;Red Mosquito&quot;.<br /><br /> Thanks For Reading!n almost-not-there guitar beat.

Good if you like Jazz, otherwise rather boring.....I fall into the second category.      Overall, 'No Code' has its high points(&quot;Hail, Hail&quot;, &quot;Habit&quot;, &quot;Mankind&quot;, &quot;Red Mosquito&quot;), but some tracks seem boring(Ex. &quot;Around The Bend&quot;, &quot;Sometimes&quot;, &quot;Off He Goes&quot;), and some tracks are disjointed and seem like filler(Ex. &quot;I'm Open&quot;, &quot;Present Tense&quot;, &quot;Lukin&quot;). 'No Code' isn't bad, but it's not above average either, just average. You will find some great songs, and to the &quot;big fans&quot;, they might claim I don't &quot;understand the songs&quot;, but I find some of them a bit generic and not up to par with other Pearl Jam albums. Oh well, this is Pearl Jam's worst, but it's still not bad!      RECOMMENDED TO FANS OF PEARL JAM, JAZZ, AND 90'S ROCK. ALTHOUGH MY LEAST FAVORITE PEARL JAM ALBUM, SOME PEOPLE MAY FAVOR IT FOR ITS CREATIVE EXPERIMENTATION!      Also Recommended-      Vs.- Pearl Jam   Purple- Stone Temple Pilots   Bleach- Nirvana      Killer Kuts- &quot;Habit&quot;, &quot;Hail, Hail&quot;, &quot;Mankind&quot;, and &quot;Red Mosquito&quot;.      Thanks For Reading!
B0001ZX0OW|4.0|Not as good as I had hoped, based on the buzz. Sean Penn and Tim Robbins are excellent. Laurence Fishburne saying &quot;car&quot; with a Boston accent is hilarious, and ridiculous. The movie is basically a two-hour cop drama suitable for television except that Penn and Robbins are so good. I must say I am glad I did not buy this one.
B00028HBKC|5.0|The camera-work is fantastic, as is the music, the acting - there is too much violence here, long before the crusifixion I think, but it's presented in a way you can really feel with Jesus what he went through - for me Gibson succeded here - a story we all know, wether we have faith in it or not, a must-see for everyone - a masterpiece.
0316776963|5.0|Well, this was just great! Each one of these essays was fabulous -- funny, witty, wry, and quirky. Sedaris's perspective is unique, and he has a way of taking the most mundane events (going out to dinner with his father, say) and making them seem like epic stories full of meaning and insights into the plight of humanity, and yet taking the most seemingly romantic situations (like moving to Paris) and grounding them satisfyingly in the mundane.  <br />  <br /> Plus he's freakin' hilarious. <br />  <br /> I think my favorite essays were the ones in part two that dealt with his attempts to learn French. He turns culture clash into comedy gold! (&quot;'I hate you,' [the French teacher] said to me one afternoon. Her English was flawless. 'I really, really hate you.' Call me sensitive, but I couldn't help but take it personally.&quot;) Hee! How can you not love this guy?
B00008EY9G|5.0|The idea in this film is against its appearance, it will have you digging for answers in the wrong places, much like the characters in the story. <br /> <br />The twist at the end is dark, shocking, unique and it leaves you pondering. <br /> <br />The conception of the twist makes this DVD definitely worth adding to your collection. <br /> <br />This film hurls clues at you from all directions making you constantly trying to guess the Identity. <br /> <br />I give it a 5-star rating for originality. <br /> <br />This film is not what it seems.  Do see it.
0380778556|3.0|I had to read this book for an honors english class and I could hardly get past the first 100 pages. After the that, the plot picked up the pace and it became a halfway decent book. I would advise anyone who quits reading after one boring chapter not to even try this book.
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|Actually this is just a quick bit of info. The song &quot;The Nurse who loved me&quot; was not a Perfect Circle song. It is a song by a band named Failure, who ironically enough are no longer together. I dont really like their version. Just wanted to clear a couple things up. Peace out! But check out Failure!
B00024BHTC|1.0|Who's writing all these 5 star reviews??? I bought this album expecting something out of this world, but found it a pathetic album to listen to.  Symphonic rock?  Symphonic bull more like!  Get a life you Muppets.
B000021YQV|5.0|ok i am being honest. I do not like rock very much. maybe a few songs. I am a hardcore rap fan. But... this album is awesome. Me and my homie who are both rap listeners love this cd. It has a song for every kind of mood you are in. My personal Favs are ATWA and Forest. Everyone should buy this. Even if you dont like rock you will like this album. 5 Stars!
B000286S8S|1.0|Firstly, I agree with all the reviews about the re-release of the same songs as the 'Best of' album. It makes the first attempt pointless.  Secondly, I thought the new tracks are absolutely awful.  What does shine in both compilations is the drop in quality of Van Halen.  When they first appeared they were raw, fresh and they had a showman - DLR that was awesome.  After his departure Hagar came in, stuck the band into a poppy direction and ruined the band for life.  The new songs speak for themselves, they are crap.  Eddie's guitaring is nothing special, he seems to be copying the Nu-Metal grunge theme.  Sammy's song writing is what you should expect I guess from a fifty year old has-been.  Overall, I can't give this more than 1 star.  All I can recommened to any potential VH fan is to get their first 4 albums.  All the albums afterwards were nothing special.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|I am so excited that the Gilmore Girls was finally released on DVD! The only problem is that it's so good,I finished the whole season in about a week... This is an awesome show! The writers of this show are unbelievable, the wit is amazing. I can't wait for more seasons to come out on DVD!
B00005LC1H|5.0|Fawlty Towers is, in my opinion, one of the greatest Britcoms of all time. It is one of my favorite shows, and if you choose to watch it, it might go near the top of your list too. John Cleese plays the role of Basil Fawlty to perfection, a rude, and very stressed hotel owner. I believe that no other person could ever have played Basil Fawlty nearly as well as John Cleese.  Basil Fawlty is supposed to be a horrible person, but I'd say when it comes to how he treats the people who stay at his hotel, some of them are worse than he is. The child from Gourmet Night, the man from Waldorf Salad, and many others further prove this thought.  Anyway, Basil Fawlty runs the hotel with his sensible yet talkative wife Sybil (Prunela Scales), and one questions their marriage. Working at Fawlty Towers is the smart, quick-witted, artist Polly (Connie Booth), who is often dragged in to Basil's scams and such. Also working there is the hard working, yet extremely bad at English, Manuel (Andrew Sachs), a worker hired from Barcelona, as well as the chef Terry (season 2).  My personal favorite episode of this show is the hilarious The Germans, one of John Cleese's best performances in my opinion (\\"Don't mention the war! I mentioned it once, but I think I got away with it\\"). So please, do yourself a favor and buy this 3-disc set containing all twelve episodes of Fawlty Towers, and you can own some of the greatest half hours in the history of television.
B000002NIW|5.0|Listening to this album again and again i think to myself, why didn't I start listening to these guys 5 years ago. If you mix Adrenaline's atrocity with White Pony's riffs and sounds, you find the birth of a perfect album. Around the Fur. <br />Just like a John Woo film, this album is non stop action.From the beggining to end, you'll want more beleive me. Deftones in my opinion, have about four unbeleivably powerful songs that i think are their best ever (My Own Summer, Change, Head Up, and Lotion), and three of these songs are on this album! <br /> <br />Don't think thats all though. Mascara is an amazing slower song, Around the Fur is an amazing general song. Rickets just kicks a$$, leaving Lhabia as another beautiful heavy song, Dai the Flu which is amazing, and Be Quiet and Drive which is spectacular in its own special ways. It makes me feel like i could listen to Deftones my whole live and never get tired of the riffs or the beatifully crafted lyrics. <br /> <br />This is one of those bands, like The Doors, The Stones, Pantera, or Hendrix, that no matter how old the stuff gets, it will always remain gold. Pick it up if you haven't already, because you won't regret the money.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|Chariot is a great album in itself, but re-released with the bonus disc makes it SO much better! The way the songs are re-recorded makes you feel like you are sitting one on one with Gavin and it's hard not to get drawn in by his voice. The music and lyrics are absolutely breath-taking.  <br /> <br />If you can't get into this, then you shouldn't even be listening to music!! :)
B0000DD7LB|2.0|Britney spears proves to us in this album just how weak of an vocalist she is, and that this album is pretty pointless and to be blunt, bad. <br />  <br /> 1.Theres only a few catchy songs(Toxic, Outrages and Hook up and thats it!). <br />  <br /> 2.All songs except for 2 Are sex based, sex based songs are good, but Britneys immature vocals and the very weak writing makes it bad, you'll laugh at the writing, horrible. <br />  <br /> 3.She expresses no strong vocals at all, in &quot;Everytime&quot; she does sound alright, but still weak, so you can imagin how all the album is(weak vocals, computerised alot etc). <br />  <br /> Verdict:2/5 <br /> Do NOT buy this album!it's worthless with only 3 good songs, I suggest you buy Christina Aguilera-&quot;Stripped&quot; or Mariah Carey-&quot;Greatist hits&quot;, now them two musicans have great vocals and great songs, get there albums and don't waste you're time on Britney.

B0002234LS|1.0|I enjoy Johnny Depp, I think he's a great actor.  That being said, I wonder what could have possibly posessed him to sign on to this project.  This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a while.  There's nothing original about it.  It tries so hard to be thrilling and cerebral...but it fails miserably.  You'll know exactly what's going to happen twenty minutes in.  You'll only be scared by how bored you are. <br /> <br />Save yourself some time and money and leave this one alone.
B0001ZX0PG|5.0|I'm on vacation, had already seen &quot;Anchor Man,&quot; and had no interest in making a 40 mile-round trip to see Spider Man, Will Smith's Robot movie, or the latest Mat Damon blockbuster. So it was off to a nearby truck stop with a very limited selection of DVD's for sale. Turned out to be a no-brainer when one was by my 2nd favorite director, Clint Eastwood (never try to view a Robert Altman movie except in a big theater with state-of-the-art sound).<br /><br /> Eastwood really is at the top of his game with this one. The theme of the tortured loner needing to reconcile with his past, the use of film noir framings and muted textures in a color film, the Greek-like preference for action off rather than on-screen (there was only one violent scene in the whole 150-minute movie, which felt half that length), and the transforming of potential character types into human beings of great subtlety and depth--they're all here. The film has a strong attachment to place (Boston), yet the shots and narrative continuity are so tight that watching them on a small computer screen did not detract from the film's compelling hold. And despite themes of priestly pedophilia (notice the ring finger of the abductor), rape, fratricide, blood revenge--it all works at a deep and universal level because Eastwood manages to leave most of it to the spectator's imagination. The past Eastwood aims to trace is part of the present, which ultimately proves inseparable from the past. The child is father of the man, and in the end Eastwood's innocents retain enough innocense to make them recognizable from their limited time on screen in the film's opening shots.<br /><br /> Neither the title nor the image of water should be taken lightly. Besides linking the lives of the three principals and their later convergence, it serves as a symbol of both destruction and life, of disposal and retribution. More significantly, Eastwood's archetypal association of the movement of water with mystical oneness places the story within every human's quest--as a flight from death by water and return to its role as the origin of new life. (It's tempting but I won't invoke &quot;The Wasteland&quot; here, lest it appear as off base as Ebert's Lady MacBeth comparison). All of the performances deserve praise, though my wife disagreed with me over Kevin Bacon, who looked a bit young and slight to me. (Despite overcompensating mightily to take on a Bogart edge, he's not quite a match for his detective partner Lawrence Fishburne's strong screen presence); Robins is a sympathetically lost, non-directed personality, someone who is always slightly out of focus to himself; Penn, for the first time, comes across as a genuine actor with range, not merely as a James Dean wannabe or former Madonna boyfriend. He deserves the Oscar for his portrayal of the torn (but hardly guiltless) father.<br /><br /> And Eastwood keeps you guessing throughout this entire mystery, reminding me of that little gem--&quot;Tight Rope&quot;--which he did in the mid-80's. (Wish he had directed &quot;Cruisin',&quot; which William Friedkin didn't get quite right.) In &quot;Tight Rope&quot; we're not sure until the final scene that the sexual pervert and serial killer isn't Clint himself--as he continually manages to imply and implicate the darkness that lies within us all (has any director ever had a better understanding of original sin?). For me, the one slight disappointment of &quot;Mystic River&quot; (or perhaps two) is the double &quot;happy ending,&quot; which feels forced and dramatically unmotivated, sort of a nod to family values, though I suppose it's possible to reconcile it with the Lethean cleansing suggested by the film's title. If it helped with the popular success of this singularly mature and worthwhile movie, I won't complain too loudly.y within every human's quest--as a flight from death by water and return to its role as the origin of new life.

B000286S8S|5.0|Finally...VH comes out with a definitive best of selection.  The sound is great on the re-mastered songs, and the new songs ROCK.  DON'T bother with some of the negative reviews on this post.  They are probably from Dave-era fans that do not welcome Sammy Hagar.  The song selection is great.  The remastered sound is great.  The fade out on one song is screwed up...and they never should have put in the instrumental Strung Out.  Again, the new songs ROCK...Eddies guitar sound is back to the rich, thick sound he used to use in early VH recordings!!!  CAN'T WAIT TILL THEY COME OUT WITH A FULL NEW ALBUM!

0684833395|5.0|Every character is free to think what they want of themselves, and of anyone else they come in contact with. Everyone is paranoid of everyone else being crazy, no one can truly diagnose someone else as being crazy, for if a pilot says he should be grounded because he's crazy, he's showing concern for his well being, therefore he can't be crazy. By saying you're crazy, you're not crazy. I live in a major metropolitan city, and strangely enough, although not to me, every character is free to think what they want of themselves, and of anyone else they come in contact with. Everyone is paranoid of everyone else being crazy, no one can truly daignose someone else as being crazy. It's strange how art imitates life, or perhaps I'm crazy and I'm just seeing life imitate art. But if I say i'm crazy..... <br />  <br /> Best part of the book was when Yo-Yo starts moaning outloud at the sight of General Dreedles nurse, and then everyone else starts moaning outloud right along side of him, right in front of their General. I was in stiches.

0316666343|2.0|THE LOVELY BONES certainly grabs one's attention in the first few pages. But the initial powerful surge of tension ultimately leads to a limp resolution, and in the final chapters the reader is mired in a morass of syrupy sentimentality. Sebold's &quot;omniscient first person&quot; viewpoint, morerover, though a novelty in the beginning, soon feels irritatingly manipulative; her narrator's ability not only to know the thoughts and feeling of all the other characters but, by the end of the book, actually to inhabit the body of one of those characters, is simply overkill. This was a promising but ultimately disappointing read.
0375812024|5.0|I bought the book for our first airplane trip.  Since then, my 2-year old asks to read it again and again and will even spend time on her own purusing it.

B0000DZEA1|5.0|Over the last century the number of composers that write music expressly for music halls has declined and now the great modern composers mostly produce their music for movies. In composing the music for The Lord of the Rings Shore deeply studied the historic sources that influenced Tolkein to produce an epic soundtrack that always seems to fit perfectly with the mood of the trilogy. By predominantly using some of the oldest instruments known to man such as pan flutes and the human voice he has shown his ability to effortlessly showcase a broad number of instruments in his music while never straying from the exact mood he whishes to portray.  <br /> I had the privilege of seeing Shore perform a symphony in Pittsburgh comprised of the music from The Lord of the Rings and truly the music transcends that of an average soundtrack as a score that can stand alone and will be remembered for years to come as one of the orchestral masterpieces of our time. Even if you did not like the movie don't let it dissuade you from trying the soundtrack as it really is a work of art that it sure to grab you.  <br />
B00028HBKM|1.0|This film bored me to tears.  I feel the positive reviews on this movie are motivated by a senseless cuopling of peoples' overzealous religious faith.  In this case, faith has made these people turn a blind eye to the film's CONTENT.  For Pete's sake-- it's nothing more than a long picture of torture.  There's no philosophy behind it, no exposition, no DEPTH.  It dully shows us a series of tortures to one guy, and utterly fails to make us feel that the one guy is in any way more worthy a soul than -- say-- a madman on a streetcorner. <br /> <br />This is a shallow retelling, with accent on the blood, of the last tortures of a religious figure. <br /> <br />If you're hoping to gain insight into Christian philosophy, or find meaning, or even a poignant musing about the events, you'll be sadly disappointed. <br /> <br />This movie is like a plastic Santa Claus mannequin:  Based on an important pre-sold character & storyline, but merely hollow plastic.  It's missing any deep meaningful parts that would have made it come to life.
B0001GL3K4|4.0|&quot;Love Actually&quot; is a delightful medley of seemingly unconnected love stories which come beautifully together in the end. This ensemble comedy features some of my favorite actors, and they all seem to be in top form in this feel good film which features &quot;love&quot; - romantic, platonic, unrequited, fulfilled, unspoken, impossible and even filial.<br /><br /> Colin Firth is fantastic and sexy as the cuckolded husband who runs off to France to escape his sorrows, and discovers a cure for a broken heart. Hugh Grant is a riot as England's bachelor Prime Minister whose mind wanders every time the teagirl enters his office. His middle-aged sister, played by Emma Thompson, is fearful her husband, (Alan Rickman), is having an affair with his vamp of a secretary. Laura Linney is a lovelorn employee of Rickman's, who just can't get it together to make a commitment. Liam Neeson is struggling to get a grip after the recent death of his wife and finds himself distracted by his delightful stepson's shenanigans. Bill Nighy is hilarious as an over-the-hill rock star who is re-releasing a song for the Christmas season and hopes it will hit Number One on the charts.<br /><br /> Director Richard Curtis, (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill and Bridget Jones' Diary), is an expert at putting together this kind of movie and he is certainly at his best with &quot;Love Actually.&quot; I held off seeing this film while it was in the theaters, and even after it hit Blockbuster. I was fearful I would expire from an overdose of fluff and saccharine. I finally broke down...and, what a surprise! I really liked it - a lot!!<br /><br /> This film is set at Christmas time but it brings great cheer no matter what the season.<br /><br /> JANA
B0001NBMBC|4.0|This album was a good one. It is not as heavy as the rest, but I like that about this album.

B00005JLT5|2.0|Stories of the holocaust need to be interesting. After all, who wants to spend their recreational time reliving one of the worst atrocities in history? <br /> <br />The Pianist puts a very personal face on the Nazi occupation of Warsaw, and walks the viewer through the struggle for survival of one man and his family. This interesting perspective should bring something fresh to a topic that isn't very appealing, yet has been relentlessly overdone by Hollywood. <br /> <br />But it doesn't. The story isn't terribly interesting, though the unique hero perspective this movie chooses should be fertile for a new treatment of the subject. We don't get any additional insight, and are treated to countless acts of violence hung over a thready plot. <br /> <br />I distracted myself with the movie's excellent cinematography, editing, and music. It's sad that I spent the time watching the movie for its technical qualities instead of its story, but I found the story to be less than enthralling.
B0001MDP3G|1.0|This film became literally unwatchable after the first 35 minutes. It felt so much like one of those PBS 'Mobile 5-Star Cinema' over-dramatic that I felt more inclined to change the channel rather hit 'Stop' on the DVD remote. &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; is easily, BY FAR, the most horrendous movie that I've seen this year. I'll explain my main beefs with this cut-of-the-mill love story: <br />  <br /> 1) CASTING: Jude Law is British; Nicole Kidman is Australian; Donald Sutherland: obviously not a Southerner. All of these otherwise great actors just could not make 'it' happen. Their accents were forced and slothy --not fluid in the least. Furthermore, Law and Kidman shared very little chemistry; their conversations were very unnatural and, in effect, the love that they shared was entirely unbelievable. The first time they meet is laughable; there's so much drama but oh so little substance. And poor old Donald Sutherland: There's just something about him that does not exude 'the South;' I have yet to put my finger on it... <br />  <br /> 2) ACTING: Shove this effort under the rug, kids. These are great actors in the wrong movie. Kidman resembles an almost valley girl Southerner; Jude Law always seems so confused about his mere existence in this film; Zellwegger tries her hardest, bless her heart --but none of them ever seem comfortable. Sutherland was atrocious is this movie. <br />  <br /> 3) STORYLINE/ SCREENPLAY: Well, if you like Harlequin Romances, you'll be sympathetic toward the motive of this film. It's a hard-core love story; I can't say much more than that. The way that the movie unfolds, however, is tedious. It never acheives a flow; it's all unnecessarily chopped-up into little pieces. To clarify: Pulp Fiction was chopped-up into pieces, but big pieces. The effect of &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; is supposed to be a 'now-and-then' one, but is ultimately unsatisfying in its delivery. <br />  <br /> 4) DIRECTING: Tony, Tony, Tony (should've been the title to my review perhaps? hahaha)... It's hard to explain how bad the cameraman wielded his machine. I'm not sure what he was thinking, but it's always as if the important things in a scene were sent off to the side. Close-ups were laughable and intentionally over dramatic. Many scenes has no begininning or end; it's like we're permitted to enter half-way into them. The will of Minghella was to emphasize drama, and he did it poorly. Plotline remained cut-of-the-mill --not what I've heard about the book. <br />  <br /> Folks, I've heard great things about &quot;Cold Mountain,&quot; the book. Though I have not read it, I'd suggest it --or &quot;Gigli,&quot; for that matter-- anyday over this shlock of a movie, for any attempt at art could not possibly be as admonishable as this film.
038551123X|4.0|Darkly Dreaming Dexter features Dexter, an altruistic serial killer--he only kills bad guys!  In this first outing, set in Miami, Dexter encounters another serial killer that seems so familiar, quite like himself, actually.  The search for this serial killer proceeds helped by Dexter's adopted sister, a police officer with aspirations to homicide detective.  Dexter's own position in law enforcement as a blood splatter analyst allows Dexter access to the crime sites and relationships with others in the department, creating additional background for the story.<br /><br />This novel is weird and twisted, alternately thrilling and funny.  Dexter's cold and unemotional personality easily flips between a complete lack of feeling to an almost child like wonderment about human feelings.<br /><br />Darkly Dreaming Dexter is quite unique, and definitely a read not to be missed.  It is an excellent first novel, and I look forward to reading more of Jeff Lindsay as his writing, and Dexter, develops.

How can anyone not love this show?  I hate to say it because it's only a TV show, but it really does succeed in brightening a cloudy day and it does make you feel good!!  BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT!!
B00005JLEU|5.0|It is mind-boggling that the biggest hit in Japanese cinema history is virtually unknown in the U.S. There are so many good reviews of this movie, yet I had to add my own because this movie is a quite literally a classic.  <br /> <br />As a rule, American animated films are made for children. But this is for adults, or at least older kids. (It has imagery that could disturb young children.) That said, it is a visually gorgeous, richly layered film. It is sad that Disney has announced an end to their own traditional 2-D animated films (in favor of rendered 3-D a la Finding Nemo), because Spirited Away shows how powerful and effective the medium can be.  <br /> <br />In an era of formulaic movies, it is wonderful to see a work of such blazing originality. One thing we tend to take for granted in most movies is how predictable the characters are. Good guys are purely virtuous. Bad guys are purely evil. But in this movie, the young girl who is the main character starts off rather shallow and self-absorbed. It's not clear for much of the movie whether mysterious apprentice who helps her early on is good or evil. Virtually all the characters have more depth than is needed to move the story along; that's one of the many elements that combine to lift this movie out of the realm of the ordinary.  <br /> <br />It's no surprise why this movie is relatively unknown in the U.S.: it was underpromoted when it was released here, it's by a director few Americans have ever heard of (though he's a legend in Japan), it doesn't have voice acting by big-name stars, and it doesn't have a plot that lends itself to sound-bite descriptions. <br /> <br />But PLEASE do yourself a favor and buy it. It should be part of every film-lover's collection. My biggest regret about this movie is that it doesn't have a director's audio track (yes, I know it would have to be translated), since I would love to get deeper insights into what Myazaki was thinking in every scene. <br /> <br />Once you have seen for yourself how good this movie is, don't forget to check out other Myazaki films. They're not all works of genius, as this one is, but they're all quite good and well worth the price.
B000001Y5D|1.0|First of all, I have to admit that I actually enjoyed Linda Perry's complex and PJ Harvey-ish solo album &quot;In Flight&quot;, and after reading about her recent stint of writing decent songs for today's mostly horrendous pop scene (Christina Aquillera's &quot;Beautiful&quot; is courtesy of Linda), I had a curiousity to plop down a buck to see if her official band had something that I overlooked. Man, was I wrong, for this was a torturous album to hear. Never mind playing Metallica CD's to captured terrorist allies in order to get them to talk (unless you're talking about St. Anger); they should play this god-awful album over and over----they will be begging to give up any information they know. From the stupid lyrics to the annoying vocals to the sloppy music, it is all one chaotic, unlistenable mess. Aside from the overplayed and no longer relevant hit &quot;What's Up?&quot;, there is not one song on this disc that didn't send bad chills down my spine. If Tori Amos had her piano fall on her foot, she would still be able to carry a tune better than Miss Perry does here (some may argue and say her singing style is unique, I say it's Robert Plant with a sex change and a flaming pair of hemmorhoids). If you have neighbors that you hate and you want to annoy the ever-living piss out of them, blast this garbage. 4 Non Blondes have made me 1 Non Fan.
0792843584|5.0|I think  what Cimino wanted to capture in Heaven's Gate was a defining moment in History in a particular society, which is more or less, what Scorssesse attempted in Gangs of New York. Ironically, I think Cimino got it but not Scorsesse. Heaven's Gate puts the legend of the western back into history, Scorsesse makes his own very messy legend of New York. History doesn't have to be complimentary and the social change portrayed in Heaven's Gate gives us a very ugly ending. The film is long but good, good actors, a filmmaker in his last moment of inspired madness, battles between the army and civilians,  immigrants, some can barely speak English, a ball culminated with Kristofferson and Huppert dancing to David Mansfield's fantastic Ella's Waltz... It's a pity it was a flop of flops but how could it have been otherwise?
B00008PW3Q|2.0|While I was dying to see a new FM album for years, had I known this would be the final product, I would have begged them to hang it up after &quot;The Dance.&quot; Nothing really stands out here, and at times it can feel like the same song playing over and over. Stevie's voice is aching and completely monotone. Her lyrics are dull and way too incomprehensible, even for Stevie! Lindsay does his thing like he always has, but no power ballads to show for. I'm sure John and Mick could have just left a tape of their parts and went home. On numerous tracks, the recordings just sounded awful, as if they were recorded in a pool. Christine was smart to exit when she did, though I think this &quot;never-ending&quot; tour they're have embarked upon would be far greater with her presence. Thank god at least Mick seems to still be enjoying himself on stage. It's a middle of the road work, but it's a dirt road in the winter.
B00003CX8U|5.0|Driven creative types are always on the edge and this is a great look into the world of Broadway in New York.  The dancing and music are fantastic!  You can feel the tension of the castings, dancing, relationships and the clock ticking the time away before one dies.  Great movie...
