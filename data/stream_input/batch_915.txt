B001FB55H6|5.0|Usually when you see a rating and it says contains adult situations, it only has the framework but doesn't flesh out the situations and have the courage to be adult about it. This movie feels grown from beginning to end, There is no happy(face) ending. I like how the heroes are realistic, they don't have super powers except for the blue anatomically correct god.   This movie has the most realistic ending its not all good or bad; it has plenty of gray area, as does real life.  Good change of pace movie.
B000VXJYFI|5.0|This Hendrix Album is totally different from his work with the oustanding crew of the experience, but...I'm speecheless, this album is fantastic because it shows how creative and inovative this man was. He mixed Rock, Soul, Funk and psychodelia in one magnific formula. Buddy Miles is another kind of drummer, other style, so good as the master Mitch Mitchell, but his differencial is his groove and he's a great singer in addition. Billy Cox is great on the bass, so, the only advice I give for the fans and for the people who search a new different sound, still modern although it was made in the 70's close your eyes and buy this album. It's a new experience so fantastic as hearing the album \\"Are You Experienced?\\" for the first time.

B0000DJE9R|4.0|I could listen to this over and over.  Some of it brings back a lot of memories of years gone by.  This is what we have missed for so many years, and wish he was still here to make more of the same.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|An accurate historical view of the revolutionary war period as told through the life of John Adams who was a key figure from the early days of the revolution, through the decades that followed.    It offers a great option to view interesting facts about scenes throughout the movie as short pop-up messages.    I loved it.
1448646375|5.0|Like many of us, Emma thinks she's a good match maker - when of course she is the reverse.  Many rank Emma as one of Austen's best works, and I have to agree.  Its very funny, well written, great dialogue, and it stands the test of time.  And why is that?  Why can we read today, a novel written 200 years ago, and enjoy it so?  Because we can see in Emma, so many traits of either ourselves, or those around us.  Emma is, after all, about about humans, and relationships, and the mores that we find ourselves hemmed in by.  As human nature does not change (at least within the last 200 years it hasn't), and while we have very different relationship mores to govern us since then, we still feel the constraints that Regency England felt.  And thus, Emma works today for us as it did when it was first written.    Or, just skip all I wrote and enjoy Emma for then fun she creates when matchmaking, or should I say mistakes!  Its very funny!

B00192IV0O|3.0|I was expecting more from them with it being so long since their last release.  It is okay, but definitely not my favorite.  I can take it or leave it.
0316017922|3.0|I have read all of his books, and i think the good thing about his books, is that there are always some interesting stuff pop into your head and u are like \\"uh-huh\\", in this book, happened a couple of times, especially in the first 100 pages, i had to admit, it was very interesting.     However, as the book went on, just like tipping point and blink, it went dull, and the stories became long, draggy and pointless. so in the end you stopped reading those stories because none of them really supports any solid point. almost like he was running out of stuff to write and the publisher needs another 150 pages.     either way, it is still an interesting read, at least the first half, to kill some time on the plane or train.
1448646464|5.0|Austen's books satire her society, relationships, and ideas of marriage, love, how we act vs. how we feel, etc.  She is witty and just a funny as Wilde at times, and Northanger Abby is just as funny.    However, there is a bigger satire going on here, and that is the fact that his novel is written in the Gothic romance style, now this is not your high school goths with black makeup and clothes to match, these is your breathless maiden and all the histrionics that go with it...    So, enjoy some romance, great dialogue and story, pacing and at the same time, laugh out loud in places, and know that you are supposed to!  It is funny!  And it still works today!

B002F6FQGK|5.0|The most interesting album I have bought all year. I love most of the songs on this album. So awesome.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|So Alter Bridge is one of those wonderful bands that's not listened to by nearly enough people, and so under appreciated for how awesome they really are.  I blame it on bands like Lincoln Park and Green Day for stealing temporary spotlights with music that would never stand the test of time.  Don't get me wrong, Lincoln Park, Green Day, Evanescence... all great bands, but Lincoln is a little too screamer, Green Day is a little too over done, and Evanescence is a little too emo.  You're free to disagree of course.  But that leaves great bands like Alter Bridge completely under appreciated and not listened too, because, just like Submersed, few people realize that they've heard one of their songs before and liked it... they just didn't know it was from Alter Bridge.  \\"Watch Over You\\" made it to the top 10 list on the radio for a while when it first came on.  And yet, still, when I ask any normal person if they've heard of Alter Bridge, they still look at me like I'm crazy.  No, I'm still waiting for Alter Bridge to come out with a new CD and completely blow everyone else away... so that this time they finally get the recognition they've been deserving since they made their very first CD...
144864738X|5.0|Thank God for PBS!  (and the taxpayers too!) If not for them most people would not have heard of Poirot.  Sadly, that's too often the case.  So, if you love Christie, and Poirot, this is a great first case for him - to read or share with others so they can begin a life long love of great locked door mysteries.<br /><br />This is Christie at what she does best, a murder victim, many suspects, some who have obvious motives, others not so...enjoy as Poirot foxes in the killer, and unravels it all for us at the end....<br /><br />Top form for Poirot and Christie!
B001PPGAIA|5.0|I can't say enough about this movie.  I have watch it 6 times and it's as good the 6th time as it was the 1st.  Everyone has to watch it.  My husband is the shoot em up, blood and guts movie kind of guy and he even liked the movie
B001NLL93W|5.0|I loved city of bones and city of ashes. i counted down the days for Glass! I ordered it on amazon.com then had to be put through the pain of seeing it on barns and noble book shelf. When my copy came I locked myself up in my room, and read. when I saw done all I could think of was. oh my gosh, its over. No more Jace and Clary. I kinda felt like crying, but I didnt. I stayed strong.  Let me just say the mortal instruments will wow you. I shared this book with my friend and they loved it to. But I dont think as much as I did. CITY OF GLASS will leave you hungry for more. even though there wont be. I put my book on my shelf and think, what a cool world I got to live in, for a while anyways. this book is a wow-er

1448646421|5.0|Have you ever known someone's relationship that is revered by everyone except the two involved?  Sure, there are those who can be Persuaded to marry someone they are not happy with.    This is a story of the reverse, of a woman, who is persuaded to NOT marry someone she loves.  Years go by, and the two are still in love, but unable to communicate these feelings to each other.  And, to make matters worse, the reason that blocked the suitability of the relationship is now over, (the man now has money).    That's the story, not bad at that, but its how its told, its in the telling, that makes this wonderful book so worth reading 200 years after it became a best seller.  Austen has not been considered one of the worlds best writers by chance - if you read her works you will be left better for the experience.  Notice how most of the reviews are from people who have read her books before, and this is why her books still stand that 'test of time'!    You will love this delightful novel and this equally delightful edition.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|Story telling just does not get any better. Steven King's short story was terrific and yet Frank Duramont (director), Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, James Whitmore, Bob Gunton, Clancy Brown, Mark Ralston put capture on film the telling of a tale you will want to hear again and again.<br /><br />It just do not get any better than this.
0142403873|5.0|It has been my self-imposed duty to make sure that my young son has an extensive library. Of the two hundred+ books on his shelf right now, we like The Gruffalo and Karma Wilson's Bear books the best (far and away). My son is only nine months old, and longer books typically do not hold his interest, but he grins from ear to ear every time I read this book! He is always sad when we finish the last page. The dialogues are fun, the cadences are perfect and the artwork is hilarious. We read the Gruffalo almost every night and I daresay I like it just as much as my son. The Gruffalo is a blast; I highly recommend that you pick it up for your kid(s) today (along with K. Wilson's Bear books).
B00164KYV4|1.0|whoever directed this long and stagnant movie is a moron. I Was expecting so much from this movie and it was a big let down. The only thing that kept me into this movie was the great cast.
0689865384|5.0|This book was creative and imaginitive. In a future world, people undergo an operation to make them pretty. Everyone looks forward to it. Everyone except Shay and the people of Smoke. When Shay runs off to Smoke, Tally must either turn her friend in or not turn pretty. An unexpected ending and a wonderful read that keeps you entertained with every word.
0307454541|2.0|I really wanted to like this book. But it doesn't get exciting until well over half-way through. This would have worked well at 200 pages rather than the 465 it is. So much time is spent on family history that the entire front half of the book dragged.  It gets quite exciting in the end, but it's a long wait.<br /><br />The characters are interesting. However, the crimes are so heinous that the ultimate killer didn't pass the reasonable test for me. I didn't buy it. I suppose anything is possible, but this was too much of a stretch.
B000NU2CY4|4.0|Just watched this last night on a 50\\" Panasonic plasma. The reviews are correct, it's a 3-star blu-ray of a 5-star movie. It looks the worst in the action sequences, and the best in the close-ups when the actors face the camera and try to cry as intensely as possible to win their oscars.<br /><br />To me, it never looked worse than a dvd. It always looked better. And the flawed transfer never stopped me from enjoying the story. I haven't seen the movie for several years. And I enjoyed renting it.<br /><br />I don't know if they will ever re-release a better blu-ray of this movie. And I really don't care that much. But I can respect the people who care enough complain and boycott just for the principal of the thing.<br /><br />If you want to watch Gladiator on blu-ray, you can rent it 20 times for the cost of owning it.<br /><br />Braveheart, on the other hand, is absolutely one of the best blu-rays I've ever seen, and worth collecting if you're a collector or cinematic awesomeness.
037582913X|5.0|\\"The Monster at the end of this Book\\" is a book that my son loves.  It's a book that I loved as a kid, and now my son can repeat it back to me, and he's only 3.  This book has become a must read every night before bed.  We got really nostologic one night when he went to stay at Grandma's and we forgot our copy.  No worries, Grandma pulled out her broken and beaten down copy from when I was a child.  My son adores reading the same book that Mommy read when she was his age.    This book has great images and words for a young child to read.  It repeats and keeps him very involved.  You can't go wrong with this book.
0140187537|5.0|After writing East of Eden, JohnSteinbecks productivity in writing fiction tailed off. He seemingly had said what he wanted to say in his fiction.The novel about modern france was one of his weakest but he rebounds with his best post Eden novel, The Winter Of Our Discontent. Ethan Hawley is the clerk at a New England grocery store .The building once belonged to Hawleys family but the fortune has been lost andEthan s now a Harvard graduate working as a store manager. The scenario is rather implausible if you think about it a Harvard grad managing a small city grocery.However Steinbeck quickly gets you into Ethans mind and he does it in such a compelling you believe it. The story is about how motivated by a fortune predicted by a good friend of his wife leads Ethan to listen and pay attention to the world around him and conclude that ethics and morality do not  mix well with business. Ethan does nothing illegal or criminal but he does things that are ethically and morally dubious. The last scene  is deliberately ambivalent does Ethan kill  himself or not In looking at moral poverty and how the consequences of being self aware of ones moral deterioratioc coupled by a desire for personal integrity for at one point it was Ethans most prized possession Steinbeck creates another 5 star classic if not as good as some of his other novels. I call it the weakest of his 5 star novels because of the implausibility I mentioned earlier but consider it a classic despite that flaw
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Why is everyone so upset about this book? I thought the book was great. I don't think that the writer should write for anyone but themselves. I mean could you imagine if she did listen to everyone when she wrote a book. She would go insane! There are thousands and thousands of twilight fans, she can't please everyone. If you don't like the reviews then don't read it. Plain and simple.You will really miss out on a great ending. I don't see how anyone can read the series and not want to find out the end. If you are really that upset about it write your own ending. But leave hers alone. She has a right to write what ever she wants, and its your right to read it or not.
0385736002|4.0|I read this book in 3 hours one night, after a visit to the library.  The concept was a very interesting as was the approach.  There are many things to like about the book.  The fast past I quite enjoyed and the \\"battle\\" scenes were enjoyable reads.  I commend Mr. Michael Scott for his innovative idea to explain the concept of world mythology.  I believe some people find that it was hard to keep up with all the different mythological references and believed he should have focus on one.  I disagree and (here's a assumption here... my next few words) I think the concept had flew over the heads of those readers.  Here Michael Scotts offers an explanation (for this book's world) for the myths and stories for the world.  That gods and goddesses from different areas are the world were in fact one and the same.  Which makes sense because there are a lot similarity in the myths of the world.  Focusing on one specific group (myth region) shreads the concept of the book, which would then create a weak believable story world in my opinion.      Now here are my reservations... becuase of the pace of the book, the development of the characters falls short.  As a reader I can understand the persona each character is suppose to have but I would have liked to have feel them.  For example the brother I understand is suppose to be fearful and afraid but he reads off as a whiner and self absorbed.      Second there seems to be the over desciptive usage, in one form or another, of the word: terrify... The smile was terrifying... He was terrified.  So and so frightened so and so but this so and so terrifed him.  I don't know if it's just me and my brain just seems to pick up on the word when ever it appears but every single time a form of that word appears blaring honks goes off in my head and I have to take a deep breath to move on.  (Anyone noticed this?)    But over all I liked the book.  I read it in one sitting.  If I don't like a book I won't finish it and I finished this one.  I'm have read the next book (finished it today) and is currently on a wait list at the library for the third.  (If there are readers wondering why I don't buy the book... I don't buy books, at least not while I'm in college. Books are a luxury item.  I need money for art supplies and textbooks so I give thanks to the kind person who invented the library.)

B0017I1FO4|5.0|I am new to Shinedown and picked this CD up after seeing them at a concert featuring several bands.  Good, heavy rock that is structured well with a good mix of rockers and slower paced tunes.  I think what impresses me the most is that they don't sound like a knock off of another band, they are unique and versatile.  Definitely be looking forward to their next release as well as catching up on their back catalog of music.
0553381687|4.0|After seeing the thousand plus reviews with majority good reviews I went out and purchased this book (with the little money that I had) and read the book.  I finished the book in 2 days.  It was a good read.  I would recommend it.  But here is why I give it 4 stars...<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars because it is not my cup of joe.  I love fantasy books but I felt this book was way TOO epic.  There were a lot of people to follow.  It literally was like a mapping of characters and their stories.  I had no trouble keeping up but I would have liked to follow two or three characters.  Here we have over ten.  Martin does an excellant job in giving life to his characters so I didn't mind the amount of characters, kinda.  Would I preferred he write it another way? ... No becuase then it would take away the point and purpose of this story.  Wars and fallen countries usually do not happen with just a few people, it involves countless hundreds.  But again like I said this series is a bit too epic for my taste hence the 4 stars.<br /><br />Oh and I would have liked to see a little more magic.  But I guess magic will come later in the series...<br /><br />Great story and intrigue.  I would recommend it to those who like epic fantasy.  When I say epic I mean EPIC.  Because this is such a grand scale of story telling I am making myself wait with reading the next books.  One chapter at a time between other books.  If you like a focal character then this is not for you.  This series is focal on the gears of wars.  What makes wars happen and how they begin and their effects.  The feel I got for this book was: the characters don't make the story, the story makes the character kind of sense, in a very good way.
B002BSHWUU|1.0|I see things have turned out as I expected, minimal sound improvements; obviously just another cash-in for the Beatles. I'll just add this in here: The Beatles are NOT the best band ever. Cry baby cry.
B001NFNFIK|3.0|I have read most of the james lee burke novels and obviously a fan. I am somewhat disappointed with the movie version of electric mist because it came off as a highly condenced poorly connected verson of the original story. It did hit the high points but did not develop the underlying structure that the book reveals. One of the repeat characters in burke's books is clete purcell. Clete is a loose cannon and is always the center of some sort of mayhem when he appears in the book. If he had been given the time instead of what appeared to be a fifteen second \\"spot\\" john goodman would be perfect for the character.   Although I like tommy lee, he does not convey the robicheaux persona that exists in burke's books. Dave is like a pot about to boil most of the time and although there is violence generated by tlj he does not convey the physical intimidation factor that is always there with robicheaux. Bruce willis carries this persona.  Levon helm does a great job as the general.
0316067598|4.0|I must admit, I picked up the book out of curiosity, and could not put it down until I finished. It is heart pounding tale of combat, an honest to god up close look at heroic behavior under unimaginable pressure. If you made this up, nobody would buy it. The pace of the action on a brutal Taliban controlled moonscape grabs you by the throat and never lets go.  Some readers will take pause at the author's gratuitous liberal bashing, shaky moral justifications and ambitious \\"foreign policy\\" conclusions, and I am among them. But it is his book, he has quite a story to tell and has more than earned the right, for my money, to climb on his soapbox and let his feelings fly. (ghosted to be sure, but his presence is felt on every page.)  I don't much care for the term \\"warrior\\" which is overused in the book. What makes these four young men so special and indeed heroic is that they were not born Spartans or Samurai or Knights Templar. Anything but. Luttrell was a Texas farmboy (I believe) raised to work hard, fight hard, play football hard on Friday nights, and to love and serve his country. These young men choose to test themselves, push themselves. They volunteered for dangerous work, knowing they might be tested in ways we cannot imagine. They might even end up cold, exhausted, wounded on the side of a mountain, cut off from aid, surrounded by an army of trained, armed men who are determined to kill them. And when they in fact do end up in that hellish scenario - and here I think is the point - they do not flinch. What reader among us, enjoying the fruits of democracy, freedom (and yes, liberalism) does not for a brief moment look in the mirror and wonder, \\"how would I have done?\\"  No, CPO Lattrell, you earned the right to offend anyone you want, and you get no grief from me.
0307266303|5.0|I've only recently begun running, but found this book very entertaining, inspirational, and informative. I laughed out loud several times. Christopher did a great job of developing each character, making us cringe at their faults and yet appreciate their redeeming qualities and consider them almost as old friends by the end.     Some of the reviewers complained about the digressions. I, on the other hand, really enjoyed them. I thought they added to the story and were written in a fascinating manner.    My biggest disappointment was that, while Christopher described the the colorful outfits of the Tarahumara people and the photographs Luis took of the race, none were included in the book. But I was happy to find them online, just as he described them at [...](You might want to wait until the end of the book to view them, to avoid destroying some of the suspense.)    It took me all of 3 days to read the book, and it has inspired me to run more already.

B001DJLCRC|5.0|I missed much of season 1 on AMC so I purchased the season on DVD.  The early shows are just as incredible as the remainder I had already seen from seasons 1 and 2.  There was nothing lost in going backwards in the series.  I think BB is an excellently produced, shot and scripted series - one of the best I've seen on TV in a long time.  Dark humor, shocking soap opera.  Looking forward to season 3!

B002BSHXJA|5.0|I wondered whether to buy the stereo or the mono set, and I'm so glad I chose the mono.  The mono set contains both mono and stereo mixes of \\"Help!\\" and \\"Rubber Soul\\".  Everything that had bugged me about the 1987 stereo CD's was still there, i.e. the excessive separation (music on one speaker, vocals on the other).  But the mono mixes were a big improvement on the 1987 versions.  The rather harsh, tinny sound was gone and the new monos sound very full and balanced yet still with a surprising amount of discernable detail.  If you are undecided about which set to choose and were unhappy with the 1987 stereo CD's for the same reasons I was then I would strongly recommend the mono set.
B001OQCV2Y|1.0|This is such an incredibly stupid and obscene war porn movie that I literally couldn't watch it - I had to get up and stand by the side of the theater, where the walkway blocked the screen.<br /><br />At heart, the movie is some sort of a Jewish revenge fantasy (and I am not being either anti-Semitic or very original in saying so - that term has already appeared in published critical reviews of this movie).  Not only did nothing of the sort of violence against German soldiers depicted in this movie happen in World War II, but it is a disgrace to the servicemen of the U.S. Army to suggest, even in a highly fanciful Hollywood movie, that such brutal treatment of POW's was condoned and even encouraged by the U.S. Army.<br /><br />And yes, I am aware that German POW's were shot by US soldiers on a number of occasions in WWII, but large scale scalping and using their heads for target practice with baseball bats was not, and the movie denigrates the memory of all American soldiers with its gory depictions of such actions.<br /><br />So tell me, Quentin Tarantino, just what is the difference between this movie you just made and the Abu Ghraib photos?  Do they not both depict American soldiers violating the Geneva Convention in a way that we hope our enemies would not, and do they not both cast disrepute on the U.S. Army?  The difference of course is that your movie is just a fantasy, and a really bad one at that.<br /><br />Hitler wearing a cape?  Raging at a lowly foot soldier?  Like some sort of an evil crusader comic book villain.  So not historically correct either.<br /><br />And those long-winded trademarked Tarantino monologues - whenever one of them was firing off, it reminded me of that line from the movie \\"The Incredibles\\":  HE'S MONOLOGUING AGAIN!  YADA YADA...  Nobody talks like that in real life.<br /><br />Are we, the non-Jewish audience of the world, supposed to be impressed that Jewish American soldiers were able to get their revenge for Hitler's Final Solution against these evil German soldiers?

0061537969|3.0|Yes, the dog's narrative is funny, interesting, engaging.  Unfortunately the human characters are two-dimensional at best.  It's a one-note tune.  The dog Enzo's tune - a good tune, but one note nonetheless.  Much of the circumstances seem contrived.  The writer was sure of Enzo's narrative but that was all.  I cried at Enzo's death and felt cheated that the book was that manipulative.

Being a Methany junkie I was really absorbed by the changes in the arrangements of many of his standard songs. This CD seems to show Metheney takng another step onto some some foreign (literally) and yet familiar turf.

0345444051|4.0|This had been on my list of books to read for years, and after just finishing it I can say truly that I was not disappointed. If you have ever wondered where we are heading as a species, or what human civilization's ultimate potential may be then I highly suggest reading this book. It's very thought provoking and though it was written in 1953 it has aged very well. I give it four stars only because I wish it could have been a bit longer and some of the elements been more developed. That said, if you like sci-fi, the ideas and concepts and imagery contained within this novel makes it a must read!

B001HUHBAE|4.0|It has a deliberately dated look which I didn't really care for. I would have liked a more intense experience. Had I told this story, I'd probably explored a more conspiracy - oriented look, since even the name Zodiac refers to something of a greater magnitude than just plain murder. In particular, I'd explored the possibility that it wasn't just one person but maybe something related to the spirit world and the animal world. Just one person would have most likely been caught with modern investigative tools.
B00003CXA6|5.0|I have to admire this movie and \\"Gods and Generals\\" [[ASIN:0345422473 Gods and Generals]]for the even-handed approach to this most horrible event that has forever defined the American political and cultural landscape.  Whether you call it the \\"Civil War\\" or \\"The War of Northern Aggression\\", the warriors of both sides are treated with great respect.   It makes the caricatures of the South quite obvious and takes some of the polish off the North.   The brave men of each side and their ideals are treated with great respect, and their failures are not overlooked.      If you want to understand our country, and our government, and why we are the way we are, and why the present North and South are still different, do yourself a favor and spend the seven hours these films take up.   A mature person won't regret it.   Ken Burns' treatment of the Civil War will do you well also.  [[ASIN:B000BITUE8 The Civil War - A Film by Ken Burns]]    Then, travel to Gettysburg and see the land yourself, see where thousands of brave men gave their lives and where President Lincoln gave his \\"Gettysburg Address\\".  Gettysburg, Pennsylvania and the battle fought there -- it's not a movie, it's not a video game.  It's real life.   Watch the movie, visit the battlefield.  It's like \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" [[ASIN:B00001ZWUS Saving Private Ryan (Special Limited Edition)]]  If you are an American and you're not moved and sobered, then check your pulse and check your soul.
B002BSHWUU|1.0|Historically preserving the original mixes is important but I think the original CD's did the preservation more accurately. These CD's have been given modern compression to add punch and volume and reduced dynamic range. They do not have any additional clarity. Dispite what some have claimed, you will not hear things you never heard before. I'm very dissappointed that this punched up set is the best audiophile Beatles fans are gonna get. I was so much hoping for a full remix as they did with the Yellow Submarine Songbook. A 5.1 remix would also be most exciting. I worry now that such remixed reissues won't have enough of a market for EMI to deem them necessary. That said, I do appreciate the stereo issue of the first 4 albums. Stereo is just more fun for my ears than mono. The packaging improvement is spectacular, I wish the sound improvement was as spectacular.
B001V7YWTQ|4.0|I wanted to go to this concert, but could not attend. This CD captures them doing many of their great songs from their solo and joint careers, plus some great covers. Both Steve Winwood and Eric Clapton are great live performers on this CD. If you are fans of Blind Faith or their solo work, you will love this collaboration.

In Doomsday Key he builds more depth into Seichan's character and made her a real person.<br />Rollins' stories always have a great techno-science theme and he skillfully pulls everything together.  A very very good writer with a technique that keeps you guessing and reading on and on.  I'm always waiting for his next book.
B001DJLCPO|5.0|Picasso partners with Salvador Dali to remake the movie \\"Labyrinth\\".  Add a little LSD and maybe a touch of Peyote and you have this film.  One of the reviews I read said that it is pure \\"eye candy\\" and that describes it exactly.  I loved \\"Labyrinth\\" and \\"The Dark Crystal\\" and I was really looking forward to seeing this movie.  I was not disappointed in the slightest.  This movie is fan-f__kin-tastic!  I will have to admit that I had trouble following/understanding everything until I watched the commentaries and I will definitely have to watch it several more times before I truly grasp it all but I loved it.  I had never heard of anyone in the cast.  It doesn't matter.  The cast made me believe it.  Stephanie Leonitis was particularly great. I highly recommend this movie BUT it is not just for children.  Oh, don't worry it is family friendly but I just don't think kids would like it very much.  It is too deep for them.
0634022296|5.0|Actually paying for music seems quaint in the 21st, when you can dial up anything you want on the 'net, from \\"Cry Me a River\\" to the East German national anthem. This is as true for sheet music and guitar tabs as it is for the actual songs. The problem with the homemade chords and tabs that you find online, however, is that they're often written by a bunch of schmoes who get things wrong. And worse, these bad tabs spread like a virus across the web: once a tab has been linked to enough times, you can't get rid of the thing, and it crowds out any future tabs that seek to correct it.     And so, tired of learning songs from campfire hacks and 14-year-olds in Oslo, I shelled out the dough for this book. The songs are all in the right keys and are, as far as I can tell, uniformly correct. I haven't found a duff chord in the book. As others have said, learning to play the Beatles music gives one a new appreciation for them as composers. Each was a hyper-fluent musician for whom exactness won out over approximation, and that exactness is well served by this dogged piece of work.     My only complaints about this book have to do with its design. Whoever laid it out was apparently a bit alphabet-challenged. You'll find \\"Long Long Long\\" between \\"It's All Too Much\\" and \\"It's Only Love.\\" \\"Golden Slumbers\\" is stuck between \\"Dig It\\" and \\"Do You Want to Know a Secret.\\" Looking for \\"Old Brown Shoe\\"? Just go to the M's. And so on. While the front cover design is lovely, the back cover features a horrible snapshot from '67 that has not even been corrected for red-eye, and the layout of the front matter and appendices looks like it was farmed out to a  high school yearbook committee. (The book also has a habit of snapping shut while you're playing from it. Exasperated axe-men may have to resort to a chip clip to keep the damn thing open.)    The author of this otherwise fine set of transcriptions is listed as one Rikky Rooksby. A search for Mr. Rooksby only turns up other guitar books--the man himself remains elusive. Obviously Rikky Rooksby is the front name for a secret guitar society, possibly hiding out in the mountains of the Near Middle East.
B000PFH4P4|5.0|How do you write a review for something that words cannot describe?  I'll give it a try.<br /><br />Many years ago I was a professional musician.  I went so far as to major in music for several years before I changed my major.  I do not offer this information to set myself up as an expert but only give a little history to show that I know a \\"little\\" about music.  (Probably just enough to get myself into trouble!)<br /><br />In my opinion this is the greatest album produced by Jethro Tull.  I bought the LP (vinyl) many years ago and when cassette tapes came out bought it on cassette.  After many years I have finally broken down and bought it on CD.  It is just as great as I remember it.<br /><br />Many times I have found myself humming parts of this album.  It is one of those memorable albums that you just can't forget.  If I were pinned down with a gun to my head I would have to describe it as somewhat like a rock symphony.  I will not try to show off my knowledge (or lack of it) any more than that.  I will simply say that this album is one of the top ten albums ever created.<br /><br />Yes, read the cover and the insides.  They are cute and humorous.  But listen to the music.  It will grab you and will not let you go!  I honestly cannot understand why Jethro Tull never became more popular than they did with this kind of music.<br /><br />I tried to think of a way to describe the way the many melodies entertwine, how the timbre and mood change frequently, or how emotional this music can be.  I know that any description of mine would be a failure.  Listen to it!  Become as enthralled as I have

1594202249|4.0|I'm a longtime Pynchon fan and eagerly read this newest installment.  Inherent Vice is one of the most entertaining reads I've had in a long time.  Subtle, funny, suspenseful, full of characters, intricate intertwined plot lines, hideous puns, and oddball inside jokes.  It's all there.<br /><br />I always pick up a Pynchon novel expecting that it will be the Next Great American Novel.  The man has talent and really pushes the boundaries of the genre.  But in every one of his books, I soon forget about such critical judgements, I end up laughing uproariously, wandering down some rococo side plot, trying to sing the characters' silly lyrics.<br /><br />This time, I simply enjoyed the ride.  And what a ride it is.  It is a big fat mid 60s Eldorado ragtop with a killer 8-track tape deck cruising down Topanga Canyon with the wind in your hair.  Singing at the top of your lungs.

B002MPHQTE|3.0|\\"This book is really short.  Short books are hard to write, but you made me do it.  My readers are excellent correspondents, and this is something I've learned from them along the way:  Write less.\\"  --Seth Godin<br /><br />Damn straight.  This book is an exercise in brevity.  I often recommend that readers preview a key chapter before deciding whether to commit to a book.  No need with this one--just take an extra 20 minutes and read the whole thing.  Borrow it instead of buying it; the key points will stick with you.<br /><br />Godin's points are straightforward:<br /><br />* Comes a time in doing anything when it gets hard and stops being fun.<br />* If it is something you can be the best at, stick with it through the \\"dip.\\"<br />* If it isn't something you can excel at, quit.  And excel at something else.<br />* Learn to recognize such \\"cul-de-sacs\\" and avoid even starting such paths.<br />* Endlessly coping without either excelling or quitting is a trap.<br />* Systems are designed to exploit \\"copers\\" in various ways.  Beware.<br />* There are eight common causes of \\"dips.\\"  Beware some more.<br /><br />That's pretty much it.  There are some good stories about Vince Lumbardi, Butch Cassidy, the space shuttle, and Microsoft.  But they build on the main points.  There is good advice here.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|...and that's who this mono box will appeal to. For everyone else, get the stereo discs. They sound better. I know, you've heard that the mono mixes were the ones that Martin and The Beatles worked the most on, and the stereo mixes were really an afterthought. Maybe, but the stereo ones still sound better, with a few exceptions, such as Lucy In The Sky. In my opinion, even the slowed down, stereo \\"She's Leaving Home\\" on Pepper is superior. Despite the wide/weird separation that was used on some of the albums, you can hear the individual instruments more clearly when they're coming from two different sources. That said, if you still want the mono, that is, if you are a true fanatic, the good news is that EMI really did it right. Each disc is in a mini album sleeve that is a faithful replica of the original, right down to the inserts and even the red ripple paper sleeve inside Sgt Pepper. The discs are housed in a plastic sleeve-thank you!-for ultimate protection, and there is also a thick paper sleeve similar to the LP's original paper sleeve (except for the Mono Masters discs, for some reason, which only have the plastic ones). The white album has the poster, even the portrait photos are in the right order (in my mind, anyway): John, Paul, George, Ringo. Now that's attention to detail! Being so small, some of the printing is impossibly tiny, but what're ya gonna do? Speaking of the Mono Masters discs, thumbs up again to EMI for including these mono single/EP mixes, also, they feature four songs from Yellow Submarine that were mixed in mono and never released before now (the original Yellow Sub monos were \\"fold-downs\\" of the stereo mix). My biggest gripe is the price; almost 20 bucks per disc, sheesh, you oughta get a break with a boxset, don't you think? As noted, Yellow Sub, Abbey Road, and Let It Be are not part of this set, as they were never mixed in mono.

B002BSHWUU|4.0|I've got something to tell you that might cause you pain....,<br /><br />OK I'll stop with the comparison words but, I can't help but explain how disappointed I am with this so-called re-mastered re-issue of the Beatles catalog.  I've loaded all these new Beatles CD's (and my Capitol Album's box sets, the Yellow Submarine Songtrack, One, and a few of my 1987 Beatles discs) in my Sony SonicStage playback format on my computer. This way, I can play songs side-by-side to measure their sound quality to one another. And, Gee Whiz, is this re-issue somewhat disappointing.  Even the songs on \\"One\\", sounded like a better re-mastering effort was made.<br /><br />If you have the two CD box sets of The Beatles Capitol Albums (volumes one and two), you will not need to re-buy the first 6 Beatles CD's.  From \\"Please Please Me\\" to \\"Rubber Soul\\", the sound quality of those recordings are far better and cleaner on the Capitol Albums box sets than these new remastered recordings in this new stereo box set.  I couldn't believe my ears.  However, there is only a moderate improvement to the sound quality of these re-issues as compared to the initial 1987 first issues of these Beatles albums.  The improvement over the 1987 issues is so minute that it is not worth the expense of re-purchasing all your Beatles CD's.  Trust me.  I'm really kinda disappointed.  I sold all my 1987 issued Beatles CD's for about $70, and I paid $180 for these new re-releases.  I'm really at a loss here, because although there is only a minor improvement to the sound quality, it's a very minimal improvement, at best.  But, the Capitol Albums box sets sound so much better than these new 2009 remasters, which are a bit muddier than the Capitol Albums box sets. But, of course, the Capitol Albums box sets are from the sixties American mastered tapes.  Their sound output was different, even then.  They were a bit, brighter, crispier, and some tracks even had some additional reverb added to enhance the sound (like for instance, \\"I Feel Fine\\" and \\"She's A Woman\\") which is exactly how we american's had it when we bought the 45 rpm single's back then.<br /><br />I like what they did with the Yellow Submarine Songtrack that they released in 1999.  I was expecting the same re-mastering effort, but I guess that's not the case here.  This re-issue was only \\"re-mastered\\" not \\"remixed.\\"  So, I guess I was hoping for a re-mixed re-issue of the Beatles catalog.  This box set could have been so much better than it is, as of now.  So, when will we be expected to buy the \\"re-mixed\\" re-released collection of the Beatles catalog?  In 2017 when more than half of the original Beatles fan base have already died?<br /><br />Of course, I'd give the Beatles a five star rating.  Ten Stars if I could.  But this review is based on the remastering effort that we are re-investing in, in replacing our previous CD copies.  It's not really worth it.

B0000640VO|5.0|Audrey Tautou (The Davinci Code) evokes Audry Hepburn for me. This sweet film, based in Paris, follows the pursuit of love a young Parisian woman feels for a mysterious man she finds pictured in several novelty photograph booths. She gently inspires her father back to life by enlisting the aid of a flight attendant friend of hers to take her father's garden gnome with her on flights around the world. Pictures of the gnome in Russia and other exotic locals are sent back as postcards to the father who grows more perplexed about the adventures his gnome seems to be enjoying. Obviously, Travelocity was inspired enough by this movie to adopt the Traveling Gnome for their very own mascot!<br /><br />On a trip to Paris about a year after seeing this film for the first time I stumbled upon the small park that is featured in the film as a sort of puzzle/treasure hunt or the young would-be lovers. I can't express the delight it evoked in me and finding it by accident was perhaps the perfect way to experience the park.<br /><br />Subtitled in English, you wont notice for long that you're reading. The cinematography is gorgeous and Audrey Tautou is an absolute joy to watch.

If you're a vinyl addict, such as myself, and you LOVE this album, the box set is the only way to go. The audiophile that I am will not go into detail about the the subtle nuances you now notice in the remastering, but trust me, it got the much needed boost that was long overdue.    The heap of bonus tracks, the artwork, the DVD that was always of medicore quality prior to this release, are all great. As you can tell, I'm very happy with this release. My ONE-AND-ONLY recommendation would've been to have a higher quality audiophile grade vinyl pressing that stretched the length of the album over two records and not limited to one. Regardless, Mr. Brown and Co. did a wonderful job with the remastering and I recommend that anybody who loves this album to at least purchase the less expensive reissue and leave the box set for the completists, like myself.
0273710516|5.0|In this book, Babara Minto uses easy to understand principle and clear text to explain how an author should organize his thoughts so that the reader can easily comprehend them.    The principle of the structure is a concise abstraction of all the good practices that I've seen.  Because of it's simple structure the Pyramid Principle is also easy to remember and attempt to apply.    This book takes the mistery out of good technical writing for me.  A well writen article is about well organized thoughts with good supporting points that answers the one central question in readers mind.    The difficulty of writing elegantly will still be in the detailed organization of the points (introduction, question and answers) into the structure.  Babara has provided fine points to help guide those activities in her book as well.    This has become a reference book in my backpack next to my laptop.
B000089HCR|5.0|1984 this was it.wasp have continually put out good releases. this is their first and probably best.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|This is a shortened season of lost with only 13 episodes due to the writer's strike.  It is however completely worth watching.  One of the better seasons of lost, the episodes are filled with plots, subplots, and everlast suspense and action.  You must however start watching the show from the first season in order to understand the concept and character relations.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|this is the first time i've ever bought the individual beatles cd's(purchased RED & BLUE sets several years ago)so i compare them to the original ALBUMS. everyone needs to remember that these recordings are over 30 years old. if you've bought every NEW re-release of the beatles, you might want skip this and wait for the dvd audio release. this set does sound sweet though.
B000Q67876|4.0|The movie is excellent as with any version you purchase but blu-ray really adds a new level. The only problem with the dvd is that the highlights are hard to see in some of the menus so navigation of special features can be difficult but once you realize what to look for its not so bad.
0803731094|5.0|My toddler who is now 16 months old loves this book.  The way the story rhymes, the illustration and the story line is so fun to read.  As the mother, I find that Gruffalo can look quite scary with his orange eyes.  However, every time my daughter sees him on the page, she gives him a kiss.  Something about this character that has captured her heart but definitely a great buy.  She also loves the fact that it is not a board book and feels more \\"sophisticated\\" reading a paper based book.  Surprisingly, not a page has been wrinkled or torn.  Definitely recommend!
0743497465|3.0|Purchased the book while in London and read most of it on the flight back to the US.<br />Essentially, the book was filler for my trip back to NYC.<br /><br />I've really enjoyed Brown's other works, but do think he hit his high note with the DaVinci Code.<br /><br />Deception Point has to be taken with a grain of salt and like any film or work of print fiction, you have to suspend logic or (certain aspects) of reality.<br /><br />Needless to say, it does work as a thriller and there are some fine twists, but the story was predictable and the characters less than three dimensional.<br /><br />So while the work was easily readable and somewhat enjoyable, it is equally easily forgettable.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|Honestly one of the few shows that Ive started watching on DVD and have not been able to stop it!<br /><br />It is impossible to watch just one episode - Ive finished an entire season in a few days before. It has now made me wishing for a rainy Saturday so I can stay in an watch.
1582701709|1.0|I purchased this book from birdhouse books.  I bought it used which was a big mistake.  When it arrived, I opened the envelope, then opened the book, and the first half of the book fell to the ground.  The pages were all loose from the binding.  I was surprized at how someone could actually mail this book to a buying customer.  It's unreadable.  I emailed birdhouse and sent them photos, but they have NOT resolved the problem.  I think they should mail me a readable book.  I even emailed them photos of the destroyed book that they mailed me..  I still have not heard back.  This was a couple of weeks ago.
B0013FSL0C|4.0|A kind of Freudian soap opera that I found increasingly compelling despite occasional psychobabble.  Certainly a change of pace!
B0024HH32A|2.0|One of the other reviewers noted heavy saturation of colors and an \\"apparent softness\\" throughout.  \\"Apparent\\" doesn't even begin to describe it.  On my 61\\" DLP, this is like watching a movie shot through a foggy lens.  I've seen sharper looking up-converted DVD's than this.    Easily the worst Blu-ray transfer I've seen.    A shame to see on such a classic movie.
B001TKD4ZI|3.0|This book had such promise.  I thought the title was a little silly but it got pretty good reviews so I thought it was worth trying.  I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed the first 75% of the book, but then the book changed.  It stopped being smart and funny.  It got downright juvenile in the writing and suddenly the characters turned into silly adolescents.  It almost seemed that the author was trying to rush the ending in order to get it done OR failed to do some serious proof-reading before finalizing it.  I ended up not even being able to finish the book, and being an extrememly picky reader, I doubt I'll pick up another book by this author.
B001993Y2C|4.0|As for the show itself, its quite amazing. Lots of twists and turns many of which will catch you by surprise.  The cinematography and graphics are both amazing and on blu-ray they look phenomenal.  The only reason i gave this package 4 stars instead of 5 is that while the packaging is cool, its not necessarily easy to get into.  It can be difficult to get some of the disks out of their sleeves, not terrible but it probably could have been designed better.  Another thing to realize tho is that this set comes with every episode of the show, including some extended versions that were never aired, and the battlestar movie \\"Razor\\".  All in all I'm very pleased with this box set.
B001LPWGE6|2.0|Don't buy the Blu-ray copy of these movies!   They were not originally filmed in digital so the blu-ray copies look the same as the normal dvd copies.  Sad to say, these blu-rays look worse than alot of my normal dvds.  Great movies though.   Get the dvds for sure!
B0028K31CE|5.0|I am very pleased with my cd/dvd. I waited a long time for Maxwell to come out with something new, so I purchased 2 of them and it was worth the wait. I am waiting for the rest of them to get released.
B00004YTIQ|3.0|We were looking for a cover for our inflatable pool in an attempt to use the same water for more than one day.  Although our pool is not the same brand as the cover, the cover has done exactly what we hoped it would do.
0061124265|5.0|I really like the book I could not put it down. It help me to appreciated life and all the simple things that can make us happy and most important enjoy every single minute in life
B000YABIQ6|5.0|I knew I wanted to see the entire season one, but didn't know whether it would be worth buying or just checking out at the library.  Boy was I glad I bought it AND for $15.00!  It was a great buy.  Compared to a used copy for I believe $14.00.  Couldn't go wrong.  I received it in 3 days and it was unopened, brand spanking new with the plastic covering protectant.  Amazon is the way to go!
1932100660|5.0|\\"Startling Implications\\" indeed...and hard to argue with. Compelling. It caused me to re-think my diet. And I'm not a fad-follower. Smart science backing up what some people consider to be common sense.
0307277453|4.0|If you find evolutionary origins interesting, you will enjoy this book. The author will take you on an easy to understand step by step journey of how the human body evolved through multiple cell animals, fish, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals to the present day. He shows the DNA evidence that we share with sharks, fish, and other mammals. He shows how eyes evolved from simple grouped cells that could identify light to the amazing ones we possess today. He shows the origins of our inner ear bones are found in the cartilage of sharks. The book is about reading the map of the human body and seeing its origins through living animals and the fossil record. The author is a paleontologist who found the fossil evidence of Tiktaalik, an intermediate animal that is between fish and primitive land living animals. I found this book to be a fascinating and interesting read. It really taught me about the shared anatomy and origins of all living beings.
B000031EGV|5.0|This movie is a lot of fun.  It's full of action and adventure and, at the same time, has its very tender moments.  You can't help but get interested in the characters immediately and you stay involved until the very satisfying conclusion.
B00278U1W0|5.0|This DVD is like a plane taking off. It soar's through a performance that only Clapton and Winwood could perform. I am very happy with this DVD. The folks that got to see it live got to see two greats.
0307269981|5.0|Larsson's second book is as adventurous as the first.  It is a definite page turner.  The reader quickly gets caught up in the plot and won't be satisfied until the end of the novel.  The characterization that Larsson develops is solid.  It is so easy to get caught up in knowing the characters.  Well done - can not wait until the third book is released.
B001U9BRNE|5.0|One of the best concert I have seen so far. The combination of all the talented artist in this video is beyond imagination. David Foster proved once more his ability to spot talent when he see one. I watched this video over and over again and still enjoy every minute of it.
B000ENC5YW|5.0|always liked the movie and wanted to see it again.......two great actors....they just don't make movies like they used to.....I like to see good actors, not blood and guts, creepee chopping off heads type movies like they are making now.....No wonder the kids are acting the way they are....they get the ideas from movies.....back to the movie....Sean Connery,will always be James Bond to me...no matter what movie he stars in....This is a very good movie.....it's getting fairly old now, but one forgets certain things in a movie and after watching it again, I see things I didn't see the first time around....I still enjoy the actiing in a good movie...
B00005LOLD|5.0|I have always loved this film...atleast since i caught it on A&E about 17 years ago and have searched for it since then. It was so nice to find it here and the copy is really nice with scene selection and great color. If you love Brando you'll love this film.
B00297FEUI|4.0|When I saw Transformers Revenge of the Fallen the sequel was definitely worth every penny, especially at the IMAX. Now, two years after the epic blockbuster film, Composer Steve Jablonsky delivers yet another inspiring score that flows nicely with the action packed drama of Transformers. As the title suggests the film's villians are back with a vengence to wreak havoc on major cities in their plot to take over the world. The score lives up to its name with a mixture of intrigue, humor, eerily haunting melodies in tracks such as, \\"The Fallen\\" and \\"The Fallen's Arrival\\" as well as, fast paced high Octane excitement for themes as \\"Nest\\" which was co-performed by the rock group Linkin Park. Although not as musically engaging as the original score, this one still is worth checking out if you're a fan of suspense themes and menacing symphonies that serve as a prelude of danger and heart stopping peril this soundtrack is for you. I was hoping that there would be more of the action themes in this score but giving the bad guys more room to explore orcestra wise seems to work out well with this SCI-FI genre.
0143038419|5.0|Great book.  It was hard to put it down.  I could relate to some of what she said.
B000957O82|4.0|This is a clever romantic comedy that has something for everyone. Great for some laughs, a good story and movie to relax with.
B00003Q43A|1.0|Let's examine the premise of this movie for a moment, shall we? Extraterrestrial craft have been visiting the earth for millennia. There were craft painted onto walls by prehistoric peoples. The nearest star is four light years away, meaning at the level of technology possessed by humans currently, it would take centuries at best for them to arrive here even from the NEAREST of an infinite number of stars in the universe. So, they must have craft that can considerably exceed the speed of light. If any civilization in possession of that kind of hugely advanced technology had wanted to destroy humans, it could easily have done so long ago. However, they have not.     No, dear people, the threat is not extraterrestrials. It is ourselves. Humans are doing a magnificent job of threatening the survival of humanity, thank you very much. Films like this, not to mention its upcoming sequel by another name, are nothing but a low-ball attempt to whip up a frenzy of militaristic paranoia so that people won't notice that they're being robbed blind every day by the same military-industrial complex portrayed as our great salvation in movies like this. In fact, I suspect that that same establishment had some major role in the making of this film.     Do you want to be horrified? Leave this film behind and look instead at what humans are doing to their habitat and to one another. THERE is the real shocker! Movies like this do nothing but dumb down the masses, who unfortunately seem to like being spoon-fed this kind of mindless, idiotic drivel.
044024238X|4.0|This is the first time I have read this author, and was pleasantly surprised at her wit.  I usually read alot of serious mystery type, or complete fantasy, but sometimes you just want a \\"laugh out loud\\" book.  I found it in The Undomestic Goddress.  There were actually times I had to read it out loud to my husband because it tickled my funny bone so much.    If you are looking for a light read that can make you relax, and laugh this is it.
0439023491|5.0|Catching fire aptly named because the house could have caught fire and I would not have even noticed.  This is a must read.  The second book, you think it will be a let down because the Hunter Games was so good.  Guess What you are wrong!  This is every bit if not even better.  Book three is in the works, let's hope it comes sooner than the predicted September 2010.  I don't think I can wait that long.
B001URY5IU|5.0|This is was present for one of friends son's. He loves it!!!! It was came as described and arrived on time.
630469654X|5.0|I would highly recommend this movie. It has almost everything; love, action, suspence, and humor. One of the best stories and acting I've ever seen!
0307454541|5.0|An exciting, worthwhile page-turner. I bought it thinking it'd be a decent beach read, but the writing is actually quite good. Plot development and narrative trump character depth but one does end up caring what happens to these people. I give it an A- and am very glad to learn this is a trilogy.
B000JBWWQ0|5.0|One of the neatest books I've ever read. Great story which kept my interest and gave me good material to meditate on! The book made me feel good, and more light hearted. I remember thinking that I wished the world could really be like this, and I wondered if we really do have the capablities to be like these characters. About 3/4 into the book or so I was getting a little tired of hearing the term \\"energy\\" which the author speaks of through out the story.
0694003611|5.0|Such a wonderful comfort this book is at any time. I never tired of reading it to my daughter, the countless times we read it together. It is now the book she gives to all of her friends for baby shower gifts.   I wasn't going to write a review after seeing SO many reviews.     However, I noticed in the reviews I did read, they did not mention our favorite thing in the story.     On every page the little mouse is hiding or peeking out from a different spot.  We always looked for the mouse...where is the mouse?     \\"THERE he is!\\"     It makes me smile to recall those golden hours with my little girl on my lap, reading this sweet and comforting book.   She is 35 years old now, and hoping for children of her own. Someday she will the pleasure of her own child cuddled on her lap, reading Margaret Wise Brown's forever relevant ode to the ritual of saying goodnight...and building lasting memories for them both.
1552091090|5.0|When I was a kid, I would ask my grandmother to read this book to me everytime we spent time together. It was just really sweet and loving and the fact that the mother loved her son so much was very endearing. People who are calling this book creepy are calling it that because they are thinking creepy things in their own minds. Children don't think about things like that. When I was a kid, I didn't find this creepy, I was happy to see a mom love her kid so much and despite how bad he might have been behaving. This book made me cry and laugh as a kid and caused a bond with my grandmother that I will never forget. Even to this day, my grandmother sings the song to me or even just asks if I remember this book and how much she loved it. I'm so sick of what the media has done to mostly sheepish americans. It's a BOOK. It's not REAL. It's a story, that's all. Get over this garbage about creepiness and stop thinking such horrible things. This is a really good book. Or at least it was when I was a kid in the 80's and every one wasn't so spaztic about politcal correctness or overanalyzing what an author might have meant when they wrote a sweet childrens book.
B0000507QH|4.0|Cecilia is a precocious 17-year-old, an age when gurrls just wanna have fu-un.  Unfortunately, she has daddy issues that push her in the direction of liaisons with older men, first a painter who is obessessed with her massive body and placid, pliant personality and then Martin, a middle-aged philosophy professor (separated from the still-gorgeous Arielle Dombasle) who seems not to have read Kant or taken him to heart (\\"never treat anyone merely as a means\\") -- there is a classroom scene during which Kant is mentioned, but not in relation to the categorical imperative.      While the painter at least saw Cecilia as something of a muse, a source of inspiration for his art (okay, bad erotic art, but still ...), Martin is just into her to, well, be into her as often and as violently as possible.  The sex scenes, and there are plenty of them, are disgustingly mechanical and essentially a form of rape.  Luckily, as the film ends, Cecilia shows signs of emerging maturity, to realize that Martin is bad news for her in the long term, and manages to figure out a way to dump the maniacal, out of control jerk -- one hopes for a better life with an actor friend closer to her age who seems to have the right idea about treating women with the respect, tenderness, and love they deserve.    I gave four stars because the leads are all excellent and so is the direction.  I thought the ending was off -- there is a car crash that Martin survives, even though he says in a voice over at the beginning of the film that he would die that way.  Many viewers will probably agree with me that letting someone like that loose on the streets is a disservice to society because he'll only go out and look for another Cecilia to abuse after he gets out of the hospital.  Perhaps the director (Cedric Kahn, who made another excellent film, \\"Red Lights\\" -- see my review) meant to show that there is hope Martin will have learned his lesson, but I for one am not persuaded.
B000002LOE|5.0|or can anyone else imagine Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks slipping seamlessly into \\"Me In Honey\\"?  (Or is it blasphemous to even imagine?)
B000W745CU|5.0|I'm very happy with this transaction. The book is as stated and came within the time period.
055358894X|2.0|I almost couldn't finish this novel. I was bored from chapter one. The prologue was great, and many of the flashbacks to Locke's childhood were interesting, but the rest of the novel was not good. The book is based on one big scam that Locke and gang are planning on a nobleman, it comes to fruition pretty early in the novel, leaving the other 3/4s of the book to throw problems and trouble in Locke's way. In addition to the plot not keeping my interest, the writing style was strange. An event would happen, then we would have to go back in time and read about how it happened, just to pick back up at the event happening. An event would happen, there would be a twist, then we have to read about how exactly the thieves accomplished the twist. Just explaining the twist was enough. I really wanted to like this book, I could have given up much earlier but since I spent so much time on it I felt compelled to finish. This book is mostly dialogue, but the characters weren't interesting enough for me to enjoy that. The capers weren't funny, fun, or exciting. In my opinion, a failed attempt at something that could have been good. If told a little differently, and rearranged a bit, this book would have shown promise. Unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend it.
B001OB7R7S|5.0|Back in 1983, I had moved from Chicago to Los Angeles and went into the U.S. Army. I heard this album before I went to service and fell in love with every song! Donald Fagen, you are, indeed, the \\"M-A-N!\\" I got through my four-year stint with these songs and I simply love the whole genre expressed in photos and lyrics!...Man!...What an album!...What an Artist!...and the memories!...LOL!....You Da Man Don!.....
B001PPLIEG|4.0|Good movie, especially for $10.00. Saw it in the theater not so good plays better on a small screen. Probably shot for a TV screen. Lousy credibility for the director good for the after market.
031606792X|2.0|I am going to keep this short...as short as I can.    After reading this book I am convinced that we got an up-close-and-personal view into a Stephanie Meyer fantacy starring Stephanie Meyer as \\"Bella\\" and she totally went to wacko land with this one.     If anyone as ever read how Meyer came up with the idea for Twilight you will see she says she had a dream about a girl and a vampire and poof Twilight was born. But who dreams about watching other people? No one. What she probably meant to say, but was told not to by her publisher cause it would ruin the reads fantacy, was that she had a dream about HERSELF and a vampire. I think Meyer molded Bella out of herself so she could live out a love affair with Edward. But Edward wasn't enough, she wanted Jacob and a baby and her vampire family and her human family and money and a sweet little cottage...in the end she wanted it all for herself...I mean Bella. She got a little greedy don't you think?    There were so many things wrong with this book it was hard to find what was right. Seth and Leah...they were the best part of this book. Oh and Jacob's blonde jokes.    I am a Twilight fan. I fell in love with the first two books and the third was good enough to keep me wanting more. I never thought of Meyer as a good writer but I thought of her as a great story teller. That is until Breaking Dawn.
0307269981|4.0|What a shame Stieg Larsson passed away, no more wonderful books with his star Lisbeth Salander, a combo of Little Nikita and Jack Reacher, who battles powerful enemies with grit, determination and a touch of evil.  I always look forward to the next Lee Child book, love his character Jack Reacher, and would have anticipated Stieg's next book with same level of excitement.  Alas, not to be.  I also thoroughly enjoyed The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo which led to this story---however this one is a serious page turner.
B002BSHWUU|1.0|The technical sound quality limits of the CD were surpassed several years ago by SACD, DVD- Audio and Blu-Ray...with typical 24 bit , 96 or 192khz sample rates...I wonder why they don't offer these box sets at these higher quality rates? Actually, I know the answer....the general consumer hasn't progressed past the limits of CD audio quality, deciding they were happy with that, or worse...happy settling for compressed digital file formats. Bummer.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|After purchasing a few of the remastered CD's I decided to splurge and buy the complete set. All I can say is WOW! They sound fantastic. I have all the old cd's and I have compared the two and the new remasters blow those out of the water. The sound is very crisp and clean and in true stereo. Some of the old Beatles records were presented in \\"fake\\" stereo which was a mono mix made to sound stereo. These masters are a wonderful collection, the glossy booklets that come with each album are a fantastic addition to each album. Buy this collection if you want to experience the Beatles complete library with stunning sound quality.
B0001XPY1G|5.0|This 2-disc compilation contains all of my favorites from The Jacksons, from their earlier songs to the later ones, and they sound reasonably good.  The booklet, however, is slim with even slimmer linear notes, comprised of two columns adjoining photos extending two pages (frontside and backside of the same page).  So if you're looking for extensive backstory info on The Jacksons, the enclosed booklet is not the source, and the pictures, for some inexplicable reason, are tinted with red (except for the first photograph).  Maybe to match the red CDs.  Would have enjoyed more natural looking photos and more of them.  But apart from that, I am pleased with this compilation because it does indeed have their greatest hits on one compilation, it's a 2004 issue and the sound is good, as I have mentioned.      I was looking at the \\"Gold - Jackson 5\\" CD but in reviewing the tracks, I did not recognize a good number of them, and that CD does not contain all their recognizable and best hits, only some of them.  I checked out other CDs of The Jacksons as well.  But in my estimation, this 2-disc compilation may be your best bet if The Jackson's greatest hits is what you're looking for, and you want a good-sounding CD, at least until a new compilation, which is probably in the works, arrives.
B000002L75|3.0|The album's a mixed bag, a transition from the juvenile blips and bloops of their early days to the bestselling industrial chants of their middle period, and marks their break into American commercial success with People Are People. The lyrics get darker, sampling becomes a central part of the production, the music gets a bit more sophisticated, and Alan Wilder plays a larger role. It has some forgettable tracks and a few standouts, Blasphemous Rumours being perhaps the best (and it's neither \\"nihilistic\\" nor an \\"eye-roller\\"). Overall, not quite a \\"great\\" album, but worth getting if you've already got and like the three albums following (Black Celebration, Music for the Masses, Violator), when they hit their peak.    My real reason for writing this, though, is to object to Beth Bessmer's inane review, which tells us nothing except that the author has no idea what she's talking about. DM have certainly been guilty of some crap songwriting on occasion, but Blasphemous Rumours is well-written and sharply ironic, and there's nothing \\"arbitrary\\" about them targeting religion, it's a recurring theme in their work. Which anyone who had done their homework or spent any real time listening to them would know.
B00000JPYQ|5.0|This is one truly fantastic and magnificent live album! The band is great as are also the songs. To my mind (ear) there are no weak numbers here. Even more than that, the songs are much stronger than on studio albums! Sheer rock energy together with virtuoso musical skills (Shenker being in the spotlight) make this record unforgetable from start to finish. Hard rock just doesn't get better than this. This is the ONE! If you are still thinking, don't. This is absolutely a must-have.
0452295548|5.0|Dr. Jill Taylor does a great job of explaining what it is liked to be a well-trained scientist who becomes trapped in her own body after a serious stroke.  I recommend this book without any reservations!  I found myself thinking about numerous \\"mind, body, spirit\\" questions as well as considering what are the most important issues in our lives.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|I liked everything about this movie, the era, the characters, the lines.  It's one of my favorites. Emma is fun and funny.  The pace is quite slower than many people are used to now, but that also makes it a refreshing change from our hectic fast-paced society.  It shipped quickly and in perfect condition.
1401923119|5.0|I couldn't stop reading this last night.  Very well written.  When it comes to quantum physics, it can be very challenging to wrap your mind around it but the author has made it much simpler to understand.  EXCELLENT BOOK!!!
0312370849|5.0|I don't know that this is a book you love...because of the subject matter, but it is surely a most compelling one. I am amazed that as a student of history and a traveler,  spending time in both Paris, other French cities and also in Germany, I had never heard of or encountered the stories of the Val D'Hiver children or of the atrocities the French Gendarmes committed against their own countrymen. We assume the Nazi leaders and their hatred destroyed millions of innocents but to actually realize the French complicity with the Nazis could do this is overwhelming. So many evil things happened during WW II, and there is much guilt to assign from those who designed the evil and those who failed to intervene to stop it. Perhaps the best preventative for having anything like that ever happen again is continual reminders of the damage. This   is well written and while historical is even more a character study of how one incident can cause ripples which continue into the lives of others who simply discover the pain, and want in some way just to remedy it.
0307269752|5.0|when an adapted movie from a novel could have turned out so good, i guess that the original novel would be definitely good. and it is actually so. i've had a thrill ride of the movie itself and recommend you who love this book to watch this movie and making it look more like a 3-D novel.
B0025X4P24|5.0|Five HUGE Stars!!! Multi-award winning star Vanessa Williams is back with her unique, instantly recognizable voice and artistry, and she's as great as ever. Stepping momentarily away from the TV (\\"Ugly Betty\\" and a great A&E channel singing special), the movies, and Broadway successes, she returns to the studio, dropping her first recording in 5 years. On \\"The Real Thing\\", two years in the making, this former Miss America uses her beautiful upper-middle register a lot on what is an exceptionally conceived and executed CD. With carefully chosen songs from a wide swath of artists like soul stalwart Bill Withers, Brazilian diva Bebel Gilberto, Stevie Wonder, Sammy Cahn, \\"Babyface\\" Edmonds, and the amazing Javier Colon (with whom she duets), she creates urgency by singing on the sonic arc of her voice and is clearly having a great time with this ballad, jazz, R&B, latin, and pop material and her musicians, based on some great arrangements.<br /><br />The \\"best of the best' begins with \\"Hello Like Before\\", which tops the Jon Lucien version with Vanessa's creative voice floating over a very nice arrangement with strings. She drops into her rich lower middle register for an engaging \\"If There Were No Song\\". She absolutely takes Bebel Gilberto's mellow \\"Close To You\\" as her own with Vanessa singing in English and Portuguese in a sensational performance. \\"Lazy Afternoon\\" gets a wonderful uptempo latin treatment that sizzles with Ms Williams voice becoming a thing of yearning and love (and it went straight to my iPod). Javier Colon's lovely \\"October Sky\\" has Vanessa and the composer in a tight attractive duet that floats on strings and the great piano of Keith Thomas. Finally, the sultry \\"Loving You\\" and the hard-swinging \\"Come On Strong\\" give us a hint of what an \\"all-jazz song album\\" could be from Ms Williams: splendid! In all, a great performance by a magnificent singer. The beautiful Vanessa Williams is back! My Highest Recommendation. Five FASCINATING Stars!

B0002F6AH0|5.0|No documentary like this can ever be created again.  The Second World War was the towering event of twentieth century, and indeed, perhaps of all human history.  As a conflict which claimed over 60 million lives, saw the lowest depths of the human capacity for evil plumbed, and which left no part of the globe untouched, there is no other event in world history quite like it.  And since it ushered in the age of nuclear weapons, there can never be another war like it again, for any clash of nations that ever occurred on such a scale hereafter would almost certainly see those weapons deployed, to the ruin of all.  And beyond all this, perhaps there never was any other conflict where the enemy so clearly had to be fought, for the sake of the greater good, no other conflict where evil stood out so strongly.  So World War Two will always occupy a unique place in our consciousness, and deservedly so.<br /><br />Such a singularly important event in human history demands, as does nothing else, a singularly great documentary to commemorate it, and in \\"The World at War\\" this conflict has such an account.  The artistic and historical merit of this documentary are simply unsurpassed.  The only other video record of a great war that can compare to this one is Ken Burns' \\"The Civil War,\\" and that is a very different sort of animal.  I said that no documentary like this can ever be created again, and Burns' Civil War documentary is one proof of why.  Since all those directly involved have passed from the scene, Burns' film was created, as any future WWII documentary must soon be, solely with the help of historians.  As each day passes, more and more veterans of the Second World War pass on from this life.  All but a handful of World War One veterans are now gone, and within a few years at most, that conflict will be, like the American Civil War, beyond the reach of living memory.  Soon World War Two will be there as well.  But \\"The World at War\\" was made during the 1970s, when many of the men who fought in that war, even some of the senior commanders, were alive and well, and able to offer their recollections of the conflict.  Interviews with soldiers and sailors who fought in that war, of officers who led men in that war, or of civil servants and politicians who directed the war effort at home, and people who lived through that time, and saw life on the homefront, abound in this documentary, and offer a view of the event that is now swiftly passing beyond reach.  Soon this window will be closed forever, so we are extremely fortunate that the makers of this series recorded these interviews.  They personalize the war in a way that no history book, however well written, ever can.  To see the faces and hear the voices of the people involved as they relate their experiences, conveys something that can be captured in no other way.  When this is combined with the historical commentary, the archival footage, and the brilliant writing of the show, as narrated by the incomparable Laurence Olivier, it makes for a documentary film like no other.<br /><br />Ever since this film debuted, it has aired continuously.  Right now, even as this is written, there is some station or network somewhere that is airing it.  Few programs indeed attain such immortality.  All one need do is watch it, and the reason for its enduring popularity will be evident.  If you own no other documentary account of The Second World War, buy this one.  I cannot praise it highly enough.  But I warn you, watching it will whet your appetite for more, and while you may seek out many more documentaries about World War Two, you'll never find another as good.  So you may turn to books and other sources to fill the gaps in your knowledge.  Then you may find, rather to your surprise, that this series has led you to learn a great deal more about the subject.  And if there is any higher compliment to be paid to a documentary, I can't think of what it might be.men who fought in that war, even some of the senior commanders, were alive and well, and able to offer their recollections of the conflict.

B001JFZ118|4.0|I have been looking for Highlander ( first one ) love this type of movie. But could never find it. Bought Highlander 2 some time ago. When I found it on Amazon and being in widescreen ( which I only buy widescreen ) I got it. The movie is just what it is. Action with lots of sword play. The \\"bad\\" guy is a little overdone but what the heck, It goes along with the theme of this type of movie.Anyone who liked this movie should buy the the 2nd version.
B002BFBAWO|1.0|In addition to being not very funny and awkwardly paced, Adventureland gave me the same experience as I'd had reading EM Forster's A Room With a View -- I kept getting the feeling I was watching a movie about gay guys that was shifted to be about straight guys and girls. Watching the extras only cemented this view. (oh, and the main female character's name was \\"Em\\" - go figure) Most of the intimate behavior was only believable if you imagined it being between gay guys, otherwise, it was just weird and uncomfortable. I had only seen Superbad and hadn't known who directed it, so I watched it on the strength of that mention plus the funny preview. So of course I slogged through it waiting for its quality to shine through, which unfortunately never did. I felt like my time was wasted, and and can only assume that the good reviews are from people who enjoyed the very realistic depiction of the late 80s, which I guess a lot of us are nostalgic for.

1439157383|4.0|I enjoyed the premise of the book slightly more than the actual book, which docked it a star in my review.  With such an unbelievable amount of hype (augmented no doubt by the major motion picture release), it's difficult for a book to actually live up to the expectations that were set for it.<br /><br />This book has multiple layers with viewpoints from several characters over a span of many years. I found some scenes to be a bit graphic (descriptions of blood gushing out eyes, ears, etc), without such details adding to the story.  The characters are a bit frustrating at times, but the story remains interesting and the situations emotionally powerful.<br /><br />The ending has become a beast in and of itself. Regardless of whether people wanted it to end the way it did or not, it was unexpected (although with so many reviewers going on about the end, maybe not-so-unexpected).  The overall premise of the book is an important one, and I think for the end to overshadow the book would be a shame. Where is the line between duty and choice, between goodness and selfishness, between life and living?  Regardless of the reader, it will make them think.
0375413405|5.0|I am serious- I hear the voice of Julia Child reading aloud as I look through this book.      I am NOT a trained cook nor have I ever paid much attention to French-style cooking until I looked in to this book and began to \\"listen.\\"  First recipe was the chicken fricassee with curry and OMG, it made our own farm-raised chicken reach Nirvana.  I have never tasted such a delicious chicken dish and the way the recipes are laid out makes it easy-peasy.  Just follow the steps, do what she says (if there was a short cut she would have put it in there) and take all the credit for preparing a wonderful meal.    The ratatouille was divine.  I did have to go out and buy a cast iron/porcelain clad 6 qt pot with lid though in order to further my studies ala Julia.  The pot helps and is just great.    Daughter was pouting around today saying \\"No French cooking this week?\\" Have some lamb from a neighbor so guess what may be around the corner???    \\"Bon appetite!\\"
B000V8I2QU|5.0|Simply put, I love this album.  It updates Springsteen characters and themes of old while still pushing into new territory.  To me , the protagonist of \\"Radio Nowhere,\\" a man disillusioned with the current state of radio complaining (or pleading) \\"I just wanna hear some rhythm\\" is the older counterpart to the character who wailed \\"I wanna be where the bands are\\" thirty years ago.  The theme's the same: in good music, redemption can be found.  And, there is some redemption in the snarling guitar and vocal of this track.    \\"Girls in Their Summer Clothes\\" is a great Brian Wilson song that Springsteen managed to write before Brian could.  It is a perfect pop song, a highlight of this album, and one of Springsteen's best songs.    \\"I'll Work for Your Love\\" with its Catholic overtones, could be a great lost track from 1975; at the same time, it does not sound like a blatant attempt at recapturing the past.  That dubious honor would go to \\"Livin' in the Future.\\"  Okay, so it sounds like \\"Tenth Avenue Freeze Out.\\"  So what?    Another highlight for me is \\"Long Walk Home.\\"  In this song, Springsteen shows that he hasn't lost his gift for depicting alienation, loss, and yearning.  I believe that this track deserves a place alongside classic Springsteen cuts like \\"Independence Day,\\" \\"My Father's House,\\" and \\"My Hometown.\\"    Yes, there are flaws.  Some of the songs are more filler than I'd prefer, and the production takes some getting used to.  When I think of Springsteen, compressed is not a word that usually enters my mind.  Most of his records are expansive.  Try this: pop a song like \\"Loose Ends\\" into your car stereo and see if it doesn't feel like the song fills up every last bit of atmosphere around you.  Magic is a compressed production.  I got past it, but it took several listens.  If I could change anything on this album, I would have had the Landau/Springsteen/Van Zandt production team instead of Brendan O'Brien.    All in all, Magic is one of the best rock albums of 2007, and it may well turn out to be one of the best rock albums of the decade.

0515141429|4.0|I never heard of Lee Child until I saw him featured recently on the cover of Parade Magazine.  I don't know how this writer of thrillers escaped my notice for so long.  But the article intrigued me enough to purchase The Killing Floor (on audio book) for a very long car trip.  This book is the first in his Jack Reacher series and kept us enthralled for 1000+ miles.<br /><br />Jack Reacher is a former military policeman who now finds himself wandering the US.  He stops in Margrave, Georgia to discover the fate of an old blues guitarist, Blind Blake.  But while having breakfast his first morning in town, he is arrested for murder.  It doesn't take long for him to realize that something is very wrong in this little town and it involves a tainted mayor, crooked cops, bribes, counterfeiting and even murder.  But then things become personal.  Reacher must use all of his skills to figure out not just what the conspiracy is and who are the ten men involved, but he must also stay alive in the process.  It's not an easy assignment when you don't know who to trust.<br /><br />I really enjoyed learning the money-facts that Child included in The Killing Floor.  He describes how much cash is available in the US, how banks operate, how money is printed (inks, paper, etc.), and the safeguards used to deter counterfeiters.  I never knew that the black ink used for printing has magnetic properties that allow bills to be scanned through machines.  I found these things very interesting and they added to his story.<br /><br />For thrillers, David Baldacci has been my favorite for a number of years.  Child is right there with him.  In fact, some claim that Child is the best.  In any case, we've already started listening to Child's second book, Die Trying.

1594202249|5.0|I don't remember how I first learned about Thomas Pynchon.  I think... Crying of Lot 49 was assigned in a survey course during under graduate?  Or my writing professor, Charles Larson, had us read it.  Since then I've read every one of Pynchon's book's except \\"Slow Learner.\\"  For those inclined towards hagiography, Pynchon is one of my saints.  In his writing, I see the world.  He is the arch druid of literary paranoia, of conspiracy; more then DeLillo,  His influence marks the work of contemporary writers: Franzen, David Foster Wallace, Eggers.  Pynchon's literary is like the world today: sprawling, complicated, surreal, obtuse.  He was a sage of maximalism.<br />  The term maximalism is sometimes associated with post-modern novels, such as by David Foster Wallace and Thomas Pynchon, where digression, reference, and elaboration of detail occupy a great fraction of the text. This sort of literature is also frequently described as hysterical realism, a term coined by James Wood, who argues that it is a genre similar to magical realism. (WIKI)<br />  I'd think you'd have to add William Vollmann into any discussion if Maximalism.<br /><br />  I would dispute that Maximalism, as expressed in literature, is in any way \\"post\\" modern.  It is quite transparently a modern project to be Maximalist.  I would like to take this opportunity to formally pledge allegiance to the Maximalist literary project, however that may be defined.  Maximalism is modern, not post-modern.  Have I ever told you how I hate New Yorker's short stories? Odd, but true.<br /><br />  Inherent Vice is Pynchon's latest book.  It's a detective novel, as recognizable in terms of genre fiction as a classic Raymond Chandler book.  Pynchon's private dick (a joke that Pynchon lovvvveeesssss to make in Inherent Vice) is a dope smoking Venice (well Gordita) Beach dwelling private eye, as familiar to your parents (The Maltese Falcon) as you (The Big Lebowski).  I don't think that it stretches anyone's mind to posit the detective novel as a primary literary form.  It exists both as a consistent earner on the best seller list, an inspiration for bad sounding HBO tv shows, and an endless source of metaphor for lazy writers.  So to read Inherent Vice is basically to ask \\"Why this book? Why now?\\"  As with every other question about Pynchon, there are literally no answers, since Pynchon does not give interviews or make public appearances of any kind.<br /><br />  I suspect that the debate over Inherent Vice is likely to be whether it belongs in Pynchon's canon (alongside Crying of Lot 49, which is also short and readable by a normal joe) or whether it is the work of a writer in his dotage.  I have to say that I'm way in the \\"Canon/Major Work\\" category because Inherent Vice has all the Pynchonian touches that you expect: dope smoking, warner brothers cartoon references, convoluted plot points, great character names, etc.  AND it's only 350 pages long AND it's set in the Los Angeles area so it's easier to get all the pop cultural reference points.<br /><br />  I experienced a deep feeling of joy while reading Inherent Vice.  I recommend it both to Pynchon fans and detective novel fans alike- make sure to get the hard cover with the cool hippie-woodie on the front. This is not a boring read- the main character smokes weed on almost every page (in Pynchonian terms, weed smoking becomes almost magical), there is plenty of sex, lewd jokes and toilet humor.  We're talking pop culture level material, here.  Stuff that wouldn't be out of place in said HBO television show mentioned above, necessarily.  The jargon/dialect/slang- in this case southern California surf community talk, is a native dialect for me, so I really dug the language play this time around (unlike other Pynchon novels where it was a bit of a chore to wade through.)<br /><br />  Did you know the Radiohead listserve \\"WASTE\\" is a Pynchon reference?

B0025KVLUQ|5.0|I guess by now everyone knows of the tumultuous state of The Beatles affairs during the making of \\"Let It Be\\". What with the invasion of Yoko Ono into their inner circle, the constant bickering over who would assume management of Apple Records and the resentment of Paul, taking on a more assertive role, as musician/composer/producer, it's a minor miracle that the project was ever completed. So when the group decided to reconvene some ten months later, with George Martin back at the helm, it was an opportunity to set the record straight, to reconcile to some degree and rediscover the magic the four kindred spirits could create within the confides of the Abbey Road studios.    With a backlog of compostions written during the \\"White Album\\" sessions, they began to put together a suite of songs that would seamlessly segue from \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\" to \\"The End\\", with a post script or rather a \\"dig\\" at their Queen, \\"Her Majestry\\". What an incredible leap this was, even compared to some of the greatest work they had done on \\"Revolver\\", \\"Rubber Soul\\" and \\"Sgt Pepper\\". The \\"suite\\" demonstrates the unfathomable depths of the Lennon/McCartney songwriting team. And if all this were not enough the emergence of George Harrison as a formidable rival to that great songwriting duo is clearly evident in \\"Something\\" and \\"Here Comes The Sun\\", two of Abbey Road's finest moments. Even Ringo steps up with the whimsical \\"Octopus's Garden\\", a song that could have fit brilliantly onto the \\"Yellow Submarine\\" soundtrack. Yet it works so well sandwiched between the raw rockabilly wail of \\"Oh Darling\\" and the plantive cry of \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\", a sort of ode to Yoko by John. There's also the jaunty \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" which demonstrates The Beatles capacity to evoke a sort of \\"Sweeney Todd\\" like black humor without sounding bleak or down hearted. There's \\"Come Together\\" where John's plea of \\"I know you...You know me...\\" seems directed at The Beatles themselves. Asking the question, can we really \\"Come Together\\" as a unit, or can we only achieve some peace and tranquility as individuals? Was the myth really dead? Or as he later proclaimed, \\"I Don't Believe In Beatles\\".     Indeed \\"Abbey Road\\" is a fitting swan song for what was undoubtably the most influential musical force of the twentith century. It managed to solidify the legend of the \\"Fab-Four\\" at a time when they seemed to be sinking under their own weight. Innovative works by The Band, \\"Music From Big Pink\\" as well as Crosby Stills & Nash's self titled debut album and The Who's rock-opera \\"Tommy\\" were beginning to eclipse The Beatles, rendering them somewhat irrelevant. Thankfully they put their differences aside, or at least they managed to work around the turmoil of a very bitter and all too public divorce and achieve, what many beleive to be their masterpiece.     For most it's difficult to choose a favorite Beatle album. \\"Revolver\\" captured top honors in Rolling Stone's \\"One Hundred Best Rock Albums Of All Time\\". \\"Sgt Pepper\\" is said to be the most influential album produced in the so-called \\"summer of love\\". And Rubber Soul was such an incredible revelation that it inspired Brian Wilson to create the Beach Boys masterwork, \\"Pet Sounds\\". But for my money \\"Abbey Road\\" stands alone as the crowning achievement of the lads from Liverpool. Perhaps it was knowing that it was their final statement, that drove them to produce such high caliber work. Or maybe it was the competitive nature of the environment within the Abbey Road studios during these sessions that elevated their craft. It might have been the calming influence of an older and wiser George Martin prevailing amidst all the infighting. Seemingly, it was a combination of all these factors that contributed to the success of Abbey Road. Either way, we're all so lucky to have this lasting treasure as their farewell gift.     \\"And in the end\\", It's a pity it had to be The End!
0307269981|4.0|This book continues with the story of twenty-six-year-old Lisbeth Salander, first introduced in \\"The Girl with the Dragoon Tatto.\\" She is surely one of most interesting and strange characters introduced in crime fiction in recent years with her reclusive, punk, misfit motif but with computer and survival skills off the chart, especially for someone officially declared as incompetent and in need of state-mandated guardianship. She has changed some from her days of working as a researcher for journalist Carl Blomkist in his search for a woman missing some forty years. Secondarily in the first book, she parlayed her computer skills to rake off a small fortune from the ill-gotten gains of Swedish industrialist Hans Wennestrom before his exposure and has thereby bettered her living circumstances with no less care being given to anonymity.<br /><br />But life takes a dramatic turn for the worse for Salander when she is identified as the prime suspect in the murder of three individuals: her guardian, a freelance journalist Dag Svensson, and his roommate Mia Johansson, a sex researcher, which conveniently fits with her diagnosis of being capable of psychotic, violent behavior. Svensson was on the verge of publishing an expose of sex-trafficking in Blomkist's magazine Millennium with many leading Swedish citizens on the list. But what was the connection of Salander to the journalist and/or the sex-business and how was her guardian involved with all of this?<br /><br />The book is a fast-paced, though lengthy, unraveling of these complications. A lot of missteps are taken by Swedish police, some more well-intentioned than others. There is a contradiction from the start for the authorities: Blomkist and others familiar with Salander speak of her extraordinary intelligence and sense of morality, which hardly squares with the psychiatric evaluations. Salander has to walk the tightrope of avoiding capture or arrest while being proactive in proving her innocence. It turns out that much of her past, both recent and early, pertains. The enigmatic Lisbeth is slowly revealed adding credibility to her bizarre personality, as well as moving towards a conclusion.<br /><br />A reading of the first book is not totally necessary to fully appreciate this book, though it would be helpful. The cautious attraction of Blomkist and Salander that got sidetracked by the end of the first book is in a deep freeze, but this case has the potential for changing all of that. Salander needs allies, and Blomkist is at the top of the list.<br /><br />Perhaps the Swedish names can be a distraction, but the real story is about human interactions, not names of places. This second book of a three-part series is as good as the first - perhaps better. The writing is sharp - not just of the characters but of the scenarios in which Blomkist and Salander find themselves. One could nitpick the plot with its coincidences, implausibilities, loose ends, and the like. But the reason to read the book is to watch Lisbeth Salander in action.

B001AQTWF2|4.0|I wept when I saw Our Whitney return to us on GMA  last week singing in Central Park...the tears were not only because they show the truth of Redemption i.e.  that after the fire upon restoration somthing greater is gained (you'll remeber how they used to disparage  Whitney by referring to her and her music as 'bubble gum pop?'- certainly they can't legitimately say that now) But I especially wept as I remembered the pain that she was obviously going through on that debacle called \\"Being Bobby Brown\\". The bottom of the barrell was when Whitney had planned a weekend retreat on Mother's Day to spend some time with BB......he still invited all of his kids and his 'boys' to tag along and was reluctant to do anything that Whitney, who was clearly paying for everything, wanted to do.     The absolute lowest point was when heartless and selfish BB demanded that she get up in front of an audience of middle to late aged Georgians 'and perform'....like his own trained monkey 'cause he was the great ring leader. Whitney was clearly not prepared - not just vocally and the absence of any backup band befitting her stature but also she was very casually dressed, sans makeup etc.   Nevertheless, out of some misplaced loyalty to BB, she got up and sang....it sounded and looked like a train wreck! and it was all captured on tape...to be played and re-played on cable.     But here is to New Beginings and the Power of redemption. Our Whitney is back with more power and grace and wisdom to impart-     When she tells Oprah of the depths of her drug addition, how she wore pajamas for 7 months- so caught in the drug vice was she, that it makes you look back and wonder what would have happened to the world of music and performance art if Catherine Jackson had been able to act like Cissy Houston? - Whitney tells Oprah that her mother, with heavily armed police escort in tow, foracably entered  her house and physically escorted her, under armed guard to re-hab.     Cissy had a confrontation with Bobby and legally stripped her daughter of all legal rights in order to save her.  I encourage all true fans of Whitney's to watch her sing the \\" I look to You\\" GMA live version on YouTube - in it she ad libs and, awashed in tears, she thanks her mother Cissy who is also crying in the audience, for never never leaving her and for saving her life.      So the album does not showcase Our Whitney at the level of her previous vocal brilliance but so what... it is a testament to the reality of 2nd chances.  Glory to Our Awesome God!!!

B000002IJL|4.0|This is a great soundtrack with a collection of great songs. The only thing that keeps it from the 5th star is the fact that it is extremely short.    With 10 songs coming from the motown machine of the 60's the whole thing comes in at just about 35 minutes. Extremely short by today's standards. But, if that's all you've got, that's all you've got. The pinnacle song of course is Ben E. King's Stand By Me. A great anthem that sums up the heart and soul of the movie well. I do kind of wish there was some original material on this disc as that would have given a better flavor and personalized the soundtrack a little more. It might have given it a little more length as well.    A good disc for the collection.

B000W91RUG|5.0|I began watching Big Bang Theory simply because there was nothing else to watch and I have to say I am hooked.  The clever, brilliantly written dialogue and the outstanding performances of all cast members keep me watching week after week.  I adore Sheldon.  His combination of obnoxious superiority, genuine innocence and social ineptitude is something special.  The episodes of Sheldon fretting over the lie Leonard told Penny, the struggle of buying Penny a Christmas gift and his lack of coping with a bout of the flu had me rolling on the floor laughing.  Truly I believe he is the best sitcom character created since Kramer in Seinfeld.  May the Big Bang Theory live on and on!

0783226837|5.0|I remember seeing this movie as a kid after watching \\"Beetlejuice\\" and the infamous sandworms of Saturn. So when seeing this film with giant carnivorous worms, I was instantly hooked. Years later this films still manages to pack a punch and still hold my attention longer than most films today.<br /><br />Fred Ward and Kevin Bacon are unlikely pair to be in such a oddball buddy film turned Scifi horror straight out the Atomic Age. Micheal Gross and the fiery, redheaded Reba McEntire (who by the way looks good carrying a machine gun, wow where can I find a woman like that?:)) play a believable married couple. With Reba's levelheadedness and Gross' paranoid but not over the top gun fanatic-turned-survivalist is an interesting combination (which strangely reminds me of my brother who seems to emulate Burt down to the wall of guns).<br /><br />Even his motto has become my brother's favorite saying, \\" If you need it and don't got it, you sing a different tune,\\".<br /><br />Anyway, this film manages to be scary and funny at the same time, a feat not easily accomplished in today's hack'em-up-while-their-screamin' horror flicks. Also, it's somewhat kid friendly as there aren't buckets of red corn syrup pouring off every inch of celluloid. The director seems to have studied Hitchcock's Less-is-more method when it comes to death scenes, though a few gory bits are bound to pop up.<br /><br />It's a very fun film from beginning to end and is well thought out, and is worth a watch. Also it's a great popcorn movie for a rainy day. Definitely worth owning.

The director's cut helps explain some of the things so if you would rather let yourself be puzzled and try to figure it out yourself then check out the original version, although the director's cut is still almost as puzzling, and, completely mind bending.

1582701709|1.0|This book can be very damaging to people who have experienced a horrible event in their lives.  The words were physically painful to me and I threw the book in the garbage can as quickly as I could.      Positive thinking, obviously is good for us in many ways.  But to suggest that negative thinking causes the bad things that happen to us is tricky and destructive business.  Consider the innocent,positive adults and children that suffer and die in accidents, natural disasters, terrorist attacks.....      This book is harmful and damaging.....don't buy it unless nothing bad has ever happened in your life.

0385341008|1.0|This is possibly one of the best books I've ever read. It has wit, humor, and sadness.  I really wanted to meet the characters and did not want the story to end.  Every character came alive for me.  The stories inside the story were poignant, funny, and delightful.  I want a second book where this one ended. The description of the war brought my attention to a time when people had little freedom and even less to eat. Human dignity remained despite the hardships and hundreds of thousands civilians who lost their lives in deaath camps.  I would recommend this book to anyone, but especially women.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0385341008 The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society (Random House Reader's Circle)]]
0671646788|5.0|This is an amazing book.  Didn't read it for a long time because a couple of my friends said, \\"It's just like the Secret.\\"  It's not.  While there are some similarities, it's much bigger and more in depth.    In my opinion, it seems to be written for a business person, but I feel it has advice which will help anybody.  Personally, I was able to see myself in many of the examples he gives, business or not.    I have read a lot of self-development books and this is one of the better ones.  It really put some things in place for me.  Maybe I was just ready to hear it, but the ways he explained common principles such as \\"excuses\\" and \\"negativity\\" was done is a way which I had never heard before and never really considered.  As somebody who has read a lot of this material, I really appreciated that.    To me, this is right up there with self-improvement classics like The Strangest Secret or Lead the Field.  It's a very good book!
B001AQO3WY|5.0|this movie is as close to the real thing as you are going to get. i was a Marine in iraq and i can tell you from personal experience that this movies captures the trash talking, the brown nosing that the staff nco's be doing and the real thoughts of Marines. good movie, i strongly advise you to get it if your into this kind of stuff but you might want to take caution if you suffer from ptsd.

B002LB4F2U|4.0|With Njord, Leaves' Eyes third full-length album, the german/norwegian band fronted by real-life couple Liv Kristine and Alexander Krull has settled on a style. Their first album, [[ASIN:B00023GPBI Lovelorn]] was very much a juxtaposition of influences from the band leaders' previous gigs with the rather different sounding Theater of Tragedy and Atrocity. The second one, [[ASIN:B0009IFELS Vinland Saga]] was a concept album centered around the saga of Leif Eriksson and his trip to the New World. With it, Leave's Eyes started settling on a a style combining nordic metal bombast and well controlled, not overwhelming soprano vocals occasionally associated with grunts. Pretty much the same formula was applied almost immediately to the excellent EP [[ASIN:B000FMHBDW Legend Land]].    Njord builds on this style and enriches it in two ways. Thematically, Leave's Eyes now paints with a wider brush. Liv Kristine, who writes most of the lyrics, tries a fresco of norse themes and legends, going from strictly scandinavian mythology (Njord, Ragnarok, Nine Wave Maidens, Froya's Theme) to irish imagery (Emerald Island, Irish Rain) and even to a cover of the traditional song Scarborough Fair, which has existed around the North Sea since the Middle Ages in one form or another (\\"The Elfin Knight\\") and is best know from the 1966 Simon & Garfunkel version in their [[ASIN:B00005NKKX Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme]]. Musically, Leaves' Eyes' sound is even fuller than before. They are accompanied by The Lingua Mortis Orchestra which is known for its collaboration with german power-metal band Rage, and they make liberal use of uillian pipes. Since Leaves's Eyes now has a pretty unique sound, it is tempting to judge them by their Scarborough Fair version. It does not have the same airy, gentle elegance as the Simon & Garfunkel version but it packs a much bigger punch and still manages to be a thing of beauty. Since the song is an oblique but rather bitter description of two ex-lovers' increasingly unreasonable demands and challenges, the controlled rage of symphonic metal works perfectly.    The songs vary from relatively simple and catchy singles wannabees (My Destiny, Take the Devil in Me) to delicate and beautiful (Irish Rain) to sweeping and ambitious. The Tour de Force is Froya's Theme, clocking at over 8mn and describing the travels of Freya, goddess of love (and daughter of Njord) in the hope of finding her wayward husband. It is musically varied, uses five different languages sung and spoken, and leaves a strong impression as not the same-old same-old symphonic metal.    So why \\"only\\" four stars ? Despite the obvious success that is Njord, I am left with the impression that the album is often over-produced. Liv Kristine's voice is clear, beautiful and rich but is is not booming and sometimes finds itself drowned in a wall of orchestration and would be better served if those were slightly toned down or if her voice were recorded more forward. A Floor Jansen (ex-After Forever) or a Simone Simons (Epica) might try to soar above the noise but this would not be compatible with Liv Kristine's style. All in all, though, this is en enchanting release that takes the best of Vinland Saga/Legend Land and expands it to show that Leaves' Eyes will not be turning into a one trick pony...

B000BNX3B4|3.0|I am a Diane Lane and John Cusack fan but I couldn't buy their chemistry in this film, which was a little slow and tepid for me.  (Why is Diane always playing the suffering maiden?)  As a rom-com, this isn't in the league of Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks vehicles...you might be better off buying or re-renting those!<br /><br />Wha might have helped - more dogs!  I loved the Newfoundland (apparently played by 2 six month old twins).  2 stars for the film, and 1 extra for casting the dog.

B0002JP4L4|5.0|I'll say up front that this movie has a lot of profanity in it, but it paints such an amazing picture of the kind of crappy situations that kids go through at highschool that the foul language is to be expected.  The bad guy is evil, the good guy is misunderstood, and the female protagonist is a rebel.  There's a lot of 80's dancing and styles, but this movie is still applicable to youth today.<br /><br />This film teaches well the lesson of what to do when there is an unjust rule governing your society.  This movie should not encourage rebellion, although if your child is not very bright then you might consider that as good reason to restrict this movie from them.
B00000DS3Z|5.0|Ya!<br />I have waited for years for this album.  Did I say album?  Now you have an idea how long.  I remember it when it first came out and owned it soon after then lost it.  I planned on another copy but there always something detracted me from my goal.  Then I saw it here on Amazon and snapped it up.  What a thrill to here this master piece again after so many years.  This is music anyone can enjoy, like jazz or not.<br />It was done by to grand masters of jazz and will always be the music of the day.<br />Train
B00127RAJY|4.0|Like all the other reviewers mentioned, it will kill your knees if you have bad knees and you don't modify any moves.  I read the reviews and bought this with the expectation of a killer knee workout and I have somewhat bad knees. However, I just modified certain moves on level 1.  For the static lunges/bicep curl I replaced that with a squat and bicep curl.  I did level 2 once and I noticed my ankles hurt that day and the next... but I have terrible ankles due to several sprained ankles during H-S Basketball.  I have had this for a month and I do it 2-3 times per week and Mtn bike on the weekend. I have changed my diet to lots of fruits and veggies and around 1500 calories a day and I have lost 10 lbs.  I had a baby 9 months ago and NOTHING has worked until the shred, and diet changes.  I have noticed my arms and legs are toning up.  I would recommend it to anyone who understands that there can be knee problems and to modify some moves if you have knee problems.
B0025KVLVA|4.0|I reserve my 5 star ratings for my personal favorites so don't be slighted by my 4 star rating.<br />While I'm waiting for some Japanese reissues of some Beatles albums, I bought two new remastered ones including this one.<br /><br />The main reason is this song: You Know My Name (Look Up The Number) [Mono].<br />\\"The song is a music hall comedy number and is perhaps the silliest song in the Beatles' catalogue. Lennon came up with the lyrics and title after seeing a phone book. Issued on 12\\" vinyl for the first time on Rarities.\\"<br /><br />I let you guys argue about the remastering.<br />The only disappointment is: I Want To Hold Your Hand (stereo).<br />\\"The MONO version sounds better (vocally). The stereo version's guitar on the right channel sounds almost disconnected compared to the mono version.\\"<br /><br /> There are 12 songs that made the Top 40 and only a few that are hard to find on other albums like: Love Me Do [Original Single Version] [Mono] and Across the Universe (alternate version).<br /><br />When I got the 2 CD set at my favorite music store in Portland Oregon I told the casher \\"I can see the headlines tomorrow saying 'The economy has fully recovered thanks to The Beatles.'\\" LOL.<br /><br />I think we can all agree the the reissues have stimulated us to go over our Beatles collection and that's not bad at all.

We have used it in relation to Educational Leadership and in class people's responses ranged from \\"I have been doing it that way\\" to \\"Wow, this is great, I've learned so much\\".  Basically an easy read but give yourself time to take it one chapter at a time to allow the overall concept to filter into the details of each chapter's information.

0061719544|3.0|In his memoir American On Purpose Craig Ferguson tells the story of his life from his childhood in Glasgow to his current job as host of The Late Late Show on CBS.  There are three strands to the story: Ferguson's hesitant, sometimes almost accidental forays into show business; his drug use and alcohol addiction and ultimate recovery from alcoholism; and, as the book's title suggests, his desire to live in and eventually to become a citizen of the United States. The book's focus is mostly on the first two of these, despite the book's title and the publisher's copy, which seems to be describing a different book: \\"In American on Purpose, Craig Ferguson talks a red, white, and blue streak about everything our Founding Fathers feared.\\"<br /><br />I had mixed feelings about the book. Certainly Ferguson is a likable guy--at least since he's been sober--and he never blames anyone but himself for his bad behavior, which is commendable. He's supportive of friends. He doesn't have any complaints about his parents. (Though he does have some harsh words for the Glaswegian school system of his youth, which sounds horrific.) The problem is that the book bogs down in details as Ferguson describes the people he worked with or got drunk with or otherwise socialized with along the way. Here he is, for example, describing the opening night of the American Modern Dance Theater's production of \\"Telemachus Clay,\\" in which he appeared:<br /><br />\\"The first night was fun, though. James and Susan came in from the burbs, Anne was there of course, and also Jamesy and his junkie wife, Lucy--who had taken to talking to me a little more since she realized I was in a play. Roswell and a couple of guys from the construction site showed up. So did the painter Steven Campbell from Glasgow, who was causing quite a stir in the New York art world at the time. Anne had been friendly with him and his wife, Carol, at art school but it was a tricky social situation. Steven loathed cocaine and had absolutely no time for Jamesy, another classmate at the Glasgow School of Art, whom Steven dismissed as a worthless trendy. It was an unfair assessment, and Steven could be a pretty opinionated guy.\\"<br /><br />This works as a point-by-point description of what was going on, but it makes for dull reading.  We never care about these minor characters, and they all blend together after a while. The book does pick up a bit after Ferguson gets sober and starts to appear on American television, and there are certainly some moving moments in the book. But it's not as interesting a read as it should have been given the author's personality and story and talent.<br /><br />-- Debra Hamelly no time for Jamesy, another classmate at the Glasgow School of Art, whom Steven dismissed as a worthless trendy.

B002BSHWUU|1.0|It is extremely disappointing that the greatest band ever can't even get their music released in the best format possible.  Being a musician and engineer, I understand what few people do - that the Beatles recordings are handicapped by the multitrack limitations of their day.  And, I understand the desire of many fans to hear the mixes remain the same as the originals.  But, compression, noise reduction, etc. are not the best solutions.  And, seriously, why would anyone go from analog tape to ProTools when attempting to keep the best sound?  Its a nasty sounding PCM technology.  They then reduce the quality more by putting it on CDs.    Maybe no one would have realized how good the Beatles recordings could sound, except they released the \\"Love\\" mix on DVD-A.  That just blows these mixes away.  And, if the Rolling Stones catalog deserved the effort to put it out on SACD, why not the Beatles?      Can someone please do the work necessary to release the Beatles correctly in a modern high resolution audio format for those of us who want to hear their recordings sound their best?    Few will hear the differences made in this new remastering if the band ever decides to allow Apple to compress their music for online sale (or for anyone burning this to their iPod), so why bother with anything other than something great for the rest of us who still prefer high resolution physical media for music?    Please, will someone release the Beatles on SACD?
B001QL35D6|3.0|Having compared this Blu-Spec CD with the regular red book CD recording of the same material using a highend reference listening music system, there is a noticeable improvement with the Blu-Spec version which overall sounds better to my ears. The 1999 SACD was widely reported as not very good sounding. If I recall correctly (as I don't have the SACD on hand), it was not an DSD SACD and would most likely not have the sonic detail of DSD SACDs.

B001O5LVPI|5.0|Since the film has already been reviewed ad nauseam here - in short: it's fantastic - I want to focus on the extras included in the 'Big Wave' re-release: simply put if you're a fan of Lilo & Stitch, this re-release is quite simply a must-have.<br /><br />While the director commentary is great (and long overdue), the 2+ hr making-of documentary absolutely steals the show here. Gone is the overproduced retrospective fluff pieces centered around celebrity voice talent and what they thought of their characters in favor of a raw, frank expose of the creation of the film which gives unique insight into the film-making process.<br /><br />You see clips from their trip to Hawaii, details on the evolution of the story, their reaction to criticism from screenings and much, much more. Most of it seems to be shot by a handheld camera and often in transit, but the fact that it was documented at all is welcome.<br /><br />Then there are clips (clearly transferred VHS recordings) from chalk talks put on for the animators explaining the characters, their design and attributes. While cut and short, they really give a glimpse into the process that you can't get anywhere else. Chris Sanders' style book for the film is also a real treat.<br /><br />If you're interested in seeing how an animated film like this gets made, this is a no-brainer.
B002GJU54E|2.0|I used to the plum books. I could not put them down but this one sucks. I am sorry. I feel like wasted my time reading it. There is no Joe, no Ranger, no other characters just Diesel, monkeys, and Lulu. I am feeling like the first 250 pages were tedious then she rushed through the ending. It was like she didn't know where she was going with the plot. I think that Stephanie needs to get her life together already and put an end to this series.

B00013RC8O|4.0|Most of my movie selections are of the taste my lovely wife and her teenage daughter cannot understand or appreciate.  As much as they love me, this Great Watch cleared the room of both within 20 minutes.    For those fans of 70's vintage movies, this gem provides an enjoyable \\"ride.\\"  The lead character has about 20 lines, the panoramic (whatever that means) scenes are wonderful, and just when one thinks nothing more strange could happen, \\"it\\" happens.    Other than that, I cannot add anything more relevant than previously offered.
0792164903|5.0|The case was in good condition as claimed. The disc did not skip and there was no real scratches. It WAS in the condition it was said to be in.
1439102813|4.0|Still Alice provides an inside look at Alzheimer's from the patient's perspective in a heart-wrenching, true-to-experience glimpse of the slow but steady decline.  Lisa Genova has used her expertise to create a story that will touch the hearts of caregivers and families facing this disease...and educate those who want to understand just what happens.  As a former caregiver, it gave me additional insight into what my mother went through as she slowly disengaged from our lives.  I cried, laughed, and came away grateful that this knowledgeable and gifted story teller put this work out there for all of us.

For others, the function of this book is to help them recognize that they have already begun to awaken and to intensify and accelerate the process.\\"<br /><br />\\"If you find this book incomprehensible or meaningless, it has not yet happened to you.\\"<br /><br />These two quotes from the book provide a good guide for the potential reader.<br /><br />A New Earth provides additional details on the problem and guidance in this 2005 book to support his previous book: The Power of Now.

If you cannot even accept the situation - get out of it or change it.<br /><br />In presenting the problem and guidance for your own personal solution Tolle uses many religious quotes, most from the New Testament.  I found these to be insightful and enlightened.  However, some challenge the fundamental western interpretation of the words of Jesus and could harden as well as soften hearts.<br /><br />The book can help you change your life and help bring about a new heaven and new earth if you feel up to it.<br /><br />If not, you will likely find the book incomprehensible or meaningless.
B0024F08RO|5.0|I love this show and own all the seasons including the final movie. Season 4 was just as entertaining and full of twists as all the other seasons if not more. I will say that there were a couple \\"what the crap are the writers thinking\\" type of scenarios, but not enough to drop my review down from 5 to 4 stars. If you are a die hard fan of the show and of seasons 1-3, then 4 is definitely worth your while.
B001IAOEXU|4.0|These triggers work good and ar worth the price but 5 bucks seems like a lot for 2 pieces of plastic.  I have them for 3 controllers.
0545123267|1.0|I purchased this book a week ago. Being excited to read it in the beginning, I found I had to force myself through it, and have come to the conclusion that it is not worth your time or money. While the composition of the chapters is fascinating, and the writing is excellent, the story and characters are weak and one dimensional. While it would be an excellent book for the 10-13 crowd, this book is not a good choice for someone of the 14-20 demographic, as I assume it was intended. Save your time and money and skip Shiver.
1594202249|4.0|He watched too much TV and is trying to recreate those shows from the sixties. He's trying to be Cookie from 77 Sunset Strip. Not quiet up to par and predictable. It's a decent read, never the less.
B000UNYJV8|3.0|While well done and informative about England's 1980s skinhead recession era, the pace was fairly slow.  Significant to note is the storyline sticks to the true non-racist basis of the skinheads for the most part, though when the original gang founder returns to reclaim his territory he brings a new more harm-filled credo.  The development of his story clearly compromises that of others in the film, which weakens the overall plot.  In the end the story demonstrates that at the heart of any extremist group is a mentally unstable leader.
B001IHJ97E|5.0|This movie came out in 1983. I have been wanting to see and own this movie again for years. Had a copy on Beta but no longer have a functioning Beta player. Ordering old movies (on DVD) online has not always been the greatest experience especially with respect to quality. Apparently, in many cases, either the DVD was made from a VHS copy of the movie or a VHS recording of the over the air presentation. Finally found it from a source I could trust ... Amazon.com! Apparently remastered for DVD, the quality is excellent and it is a joy to watch! - John Dodd
B000Y7U98C|3.0|I love Boyle's films, though this one was a little half-baked.  While an interesting take on a fairly original premise, the plot gets dropped in favor of philosophical rambling and Blair-Witch camera effects that in the end create too much distance from the conflict.  The hero's quest is compelling enough to stick it out but don't be surprised in the end if you aren't sure of what happened, or find you stopped caring.
B00013F38K|5.0|A great series with great plots ( if you look into the story line )     Loved the narration comments by David Carradine
B001E45XT4|5.0|I just got it today! It's pretty comfortable, good sound, however I though it was going to be a little smaller. But anyways, for the quality they seem to have, and for the price I've pay, they are really good.
1439102813|5.0|Being the daughter of a woman who spent ten years descending into the world of dementia, I only knew the disease from the outside looking in.  Exploring the world of loss of self from the patient was a perspective that needed to written.  The characterization of all those affected showed the pain that encircles anyone dealing with alzheimers; but with Alice, we felt first her confusion, then her fears, then the seemingly peaceful loss of awareness that comes when she was no longer her self.  This book was beautful, sad, and one that I will read again and remember always.
0307269981|5.0|Love it, loved it!  you easily get sucked in the story.  Fast pace, page turner.  Stieg Larson's trilogy is a must have if you like suspense.
1410407853|5.0|The writing in general,plot and character development,and settings were magnificent.  The only criticism I have is that the book ended too soon!
B00117S4GS|1.0|I love this show but there is a MAJOR issue with the VOD episodes - the music has been changed!  All the wonderful classic rock songs have been replaced with awful random songs that completely ruin the atmosphere of the show.<br /><br />There is no warning that the music has been changed - I was completely unaware of the substitutions until I actually watched an episode. I think it is completely unethical of Amazon not to warn its customers that these episodes do not contain the same music as the broadcast and DVD versions. DO NOT PURCHASE THESE EPISODES ON VOD - do yourself a favor and go buy the REAL Season 1 (with awesome music) on DVD. [[ASIN:B000FP2OPY Supernatural - The Complete First Season]]
B000UD08HW|5.0|Great
B001EYGOEM|5.0|Taylor Swift has more talent in her pinky finger than most \\"celebrities\\" will ever have; and it shows through very clearly when you listen to her sing her own songs on this album! Taylor's voice is as clear as a bell and her sophisticated phrasing enhances her singing all the more. This is a very fine album with excellent sound quality; and I like that artwork, too.<br /><br />The album opens with Taylor singing at her usual very best on the title track \\"Fearless.\\" \\"Fearless\\" has great percussion, guitar and more to boot as Taylor sings this without ever letting go of a single superfluous note! I'm impressed. The melody has a type of country-pop flavor to it that I always like; and \\"Fearless\\" makes a great start for the CD. \\"Fifteen\\" is a poignant tune about a freshman's college student's experiences with love, a good friend and more; Taylor sings this with all her heart and soul. \\"Love Story\\" has music that fits in perfectly with Taylor's vocals; I love it! \\"White Horse\\" has an acoustic element to it; Taylor's vocals remain squarely front and center--right where they belong! \\"White Horse\\" is a major highlight of this album; this can move even those of us with the hardest of hearts.<br /><br />\\"You Belong With Me\\" has Taylor handling complex tempo and key changes like a pro; it's been a joy to hear this on a local radio station and it's another fine example of Taylor's genius! The melody is catchy and Taylor never skips a beat, either. \\"Breathe\\" is quite moving; the guitar and other instruments remain in the background and you never have to strain to hear when Taylor Swift--and Colbie Caillat--are singing. Taylor and Colbie both sound really good on this track.<br /><br />\\"Tell Me Why\\" is a fierce tune that has Taylor exploring the pain that can come with love--it's very well done. \\"The Way I Loved You\\" is a stunner that Taylor aces as effortlessly as if it were mere breathing. Of course, we know it really wasn't all that easy--Taylor's talent carries her through admirably. \\"Forever & Always\\" showcases Taylor's fine ability to sing a torch song about her ex-boyfriend Joe Jonas; and the album ends strong with Taylor Swift performing \\"Change.\\" \\"Change,\\" one heck of a song supporting Team USA's efforts during the 2008 summer Olympics, has some interesting key modulations and Taylor handles this like a champ--she does this passionately and it leaves me wanting more!<br /><br />Taylor Swift is one terrific singer-songwriter; and hopefully she'll choose to share her exceptional, creative talent with us for many years to come. This is a must-have for her fans; and it also makes a fine starter CD for people just getting into the magical artistry of Taylor Swift.ys\\" showcases Taylor's fine ability to sing a torch song about her ex-boyfriend Joe Jonas; and the album ends strong with Taylor Swift performing \\"Change.\\" \\"Change,\\" one heck of a song supporting Team USA's efforts during the 2008 summer Olympics, has some interesting key modulations and Taylor handles this like a champ--she does this passionately and it leaves me wanting more!

1595141715|4.0|Everyone knew that Hannah Baker killed herself. But nobody knew that there were thirteen events that led her to actually do it. Until, that is, the tapes began to arrive.<br /><br />Through the pages of Thirteen Reasons Why, we hear Hannah's story through the voice of Clay Jensen, A-typical studious, nice-guy who just so happens to have the biggest crush on token \\"bad-girl\\" Hannah Baker. But he's not the first to receive the tapes, not the first to hear how he personally aided in Hannah's death. There are twelve others, in fact, and now, as Clay follows each and every one of Hannah's instructions, he will learn how they too played a role in Hannah's demise.<br /><br />Without a doubt, this book shows the cruelties, and realities of teen life. None of the \\"events\\" that led up to Hannah's death are unlikely, unrealistic or unordinary for this age group. Thirteen Reasons Why is an exposed tale of how others are affected by every word we make, by every action we take.<br />-Reviewed by Jill MacKenzie
B002LMOCJ0|3.0|Seems a bit silly to have this in hi-def, per IMDB it was filmed using a 16mm Arri SR-2 camera and used Kodak Plus-X film, decidely NOT hi-def.  Oh well, for those that must have everything in BRD, here's another.
0060254920|5.0|A perennial favorite.  I remember having this book read to me and, then, reading it to my three boys over and over again.  Maurice Sendak's whimsical illustrations combined with Max's mischief make the tender ending that much more satisfying.<br />-- Reviewed by Michelle Delisle
B000W91RUG|5.0|One of the funniest shows I have seen in a long time even with the physicist jokes which I do not get at all. Jim Parsons is just phenomenal as Sheldon, he totally deserves his Emmy nomination. The whole cast is great.
0810970686|5.0|First I have to say that I adore this series. It's so cute and it honestly has me laughing out loud in many many parts, this is just so funny<br /><br />If you're looking for a \\"plot\\" you won't really find one. This is the third installment of Greg, and he just writes down what happens to him during the school year. Some examples are:  asking girls out, solving mysteries, dealing with his dad, mom, and brother.  This is just so funny. I try to tell my students about this, and when I do, they always thank me.<br /><br />If you've read the first two, then you know what to expect and wont' be let down, it's such a great and funny read. If you haven't read any of the series, then you need to do yourself a favor and get started on the series. You don't need to read them in order, but you can't go wrong is you start the series.
0439023491|5.0|I'll keep this review short, mainly because I don't want to give out any spoilers. After all, I didn't read any before opening the book and I am glad I didn't, many events in the book caught me by a complete surprise and I loved it! \\"Catching Fire\\" is a sequel equal in quality to \\"Hunger Games.\\" The writing is superb, action-packed, and emotional. It did lack the perfect pacing of the first book, the first half was a little slow and for some time I wasn't sure where it was going, but it picked up immensely in the later part.<br /><br />What else can I say? This book was all I wished for and even more (and my expectations were very high after rereading \\"Hunger Games\\"). I am dying to get my hands on the last 3rd book!<br /><br />P.S. If before reading \\"Catching Fire\\" I was concerned whether I would be able to stay on Team Peeta with more time given to Gale, I am not any more...
B000AYELVU|5.0|I was amazed how fast this DVD arrived.  I was also in shock at what perfect condition it was in.  There were no markings or scratches at all!  Thank You!
B00005QW5X|5.0|One of my favorite pictures of all time pictures.  The story, though somewhat werid at first, is campy and cultish.  However, it has enough \\"body\\" to make one think of how life throws events at us that seem to make no sense at first.  As we progress throuh time, if we are aware, we realize the events all come together to create what we refer to as \\"our lives\\".  The search for friendship, love and happiness often falls on \\"the rocks\\" no matter how hard we strive to hold onto them. Hedwig's case in point.  All we can do is \\"keep pulling out the wig, wearing it for a while and then putting it back on the shelf\\".<br />The song, \\"Origin of Love\\" is one of the most beautiful, thought provoking songs ever written.  Truly written from a perspective of love I had never considered.  Probably, one of my favoritesongs ever.<br />If you like the off beat, silly, touching, funny, depressing and \\"enjoy life today\\" genre of flicks, this is a must see and own movie.  Enjoy.
B00005JLCI|5.0|What a magnificent movie!  Reviewer Dennis Littrell already covered almost everything, but I wanted to add my vote of 5 stars to the count.  There are other movies that deserve 5 stars on a 5-star scale, but very few like this Hamlet that deserve 100 on a 100-star scale.  To differ with Littrell a mite in detail, I think Heston was so perfect as the Actor I wouldn't consider his switching roles with Gielgud, and Branagh's presence/stature amply filled the role of Hamlet.  Bravo, Branagh, on direction and portrayal.
0440238609|4.0|The seller was very accurate and considerate about their product and shipping.  I purchased these for my wife (I will be reading them soon), and she thoroughly enjoyed them.  She did comment that she'd be surprised if the other movies ever get made simply because there are a lot of sensitive topics.
B00243FQFA|5.0|Once again the writers and actors for this series have created marvelous entertainment, plots, and visual pleasure. This has to be one of the best choreographed science fiction series on the viewing market. It seems that the ingenious writers never run out of ideas that entertain. The respective actors have also grown into their roles wherein their interaction is second nature. The new additons to the character base are also interesting; such as the former character from Star Trek Voyager, the intrepid Hologram Doctor, and the former character from Firefly, the female Mechanic the ship Serenity, and others as well. They seem to have incorporated some of the most illustrious characters from all sorts of Science Fiction series. This is well worth while viewing.
B001JNNDE2|5.0|The DVD version of this cult classic already had great clarity but this Blu-Ray version is outstanding.    The picture of this version gives the movie the extra punch needed on a large screen.  The documentary on the disc is icing on the cake but I don't think anyone would want to view it more than once.  It would have been better if interviews with actors were included.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|Best sci-fi movie in a long time.  I've seen it three times - once in the threatre and twice on the plane flying to and fro Italy. That's saying something because I almost NEVER watch a new movie that many times in rather quick succession.     Fly a plane and watch the stars.     Silly Combine
B000E5KJE8|4.0|I'm sure that many fans were shocked when Denzil Washington did an about face from his good guy roles by playing Alonzo Harris, the bad cop to end all bad cops.  He richly deserved the Oscar and I believe that the intensity of his performance also uplifted Ethan Hawke's performance since he received his first Oscar nomination.  Before this film I was indifferent to Hawke, believeing him to be a competent but stiff actor but this film and the remake of \\"Assaust On Precinct 13\\" has changed my opinion of him as an actor. The \\"bad cop movie\\" is nothing new having its roots in the fifties with films like \\"Rogue Cop\\", \\"Pushover\\" and \\"Shield for Murder\\" as prime examples of this genre but this film pushes it to a higher level.  And also the timing of this film helped at the box-office since the Ramparts scandal of the LAPD was in progress when this film was released.  If you're a fan of this genre or a fan of great acting, this flick is recommended.  It's also still available at a premium price in HD DVD (fantastic transfer!!) versus the $18 or $20 you'll have to pay for in Blu-Ray.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|This is the gift of the year.  I've already given away eight - and will probably order more.
B0012X6FR6|5.0|I've had the original CD release of this classic 1959 Bill Evans trio session but when Orrin Keepnews re-released this with some discovered bonus takes, I had to purchase this disc.  If you want an introduction to one of the greatest jazz trios of all time--you can't go wrong on this disc!  Evans with co-horts, the late bassist Scott LaFaro and drummer Paul Motian revoluntionized the trio format by performing as colloborators rather than the usual concept of piano supported then by bass and drums--everyone had in voice of their own!!  This actually was nothing new in jazz since Duke Ellington had duets with Jimmy Blanton and Bud Powell had some runnings with bassist George Duvivier but Evans pushed this to a higher level with his interactions with LaFaro and Motian.  The 24 bit processing also creates a veil of space and airness to a normally dry recording.  I've never really liked the way Riverside recorded Bill's piano after hearing him in person but at least this newly remastered recording is a step forward.  Definitely recommended for fans of jazz piano and trios!!
B0029LHX1W|4.0|The book started a little slow but picked up quickly.  It made me thankful that I wasn't born in the USSR in the 50s.  It was interesting to read about the life in remote areas in the 50s, the fear tactics, and survivial during this time.  Although it was fiction, I think the book was researched to present conditions reasonably well.
0375413405|5.0|This book arrived as described...NEW.. for ten dollars less than the advertised rate. I've bought books for many  years from THe NEw England Mobile Book Fair and have the highest regard for them.
0307454541|5.0|The other 4 and 5 star reviews cover this book well.  It has a little bit of everything in it.  Can't wait for his third book to be published.
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|Great video of The Eagles getting back together after 14 years. Great Eagles' music and lots of information about each of the 5 main guys.
B00158K0S8|5.0|Product was exactly as advertised, and I look forward to enjoying many viewings in the coming years! Thanks for the item.
0307266303|5.0|This was a wonderful book.  I am not a runner.  I have attempted jogging from time to time and hated it - but I am now ready to attempt barefoot running (perhaps after a period of barefoot walking).  What a wonderful and inspiring read.
B0028K31CE|5.0|Great album.  Was sent to me in a timely manner and in perfect condition.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Read a funny article about the hidden gems unearthed on this incredible remastered series [...]
B000007MVD|1.0|the item was damaged when i received it, i did not returned it because the freight charge might be almost the same as the product itself.
0783222149|2.0|If you are looking for a non-stop action flick with top notch suspense, vile villains and heroic leads....keep looking. \\"The River Wild\\" packs about the same punch as a Lifetime Network movie, but with an A-List cast.<br /><br />I normally love Meryl Streep in just about anything, and she does a fine job here, but the material is just so tepid there really isn't anything to work with. David Straithairn looking as though he just stepped out of a power-lunch with the CEO also does a decent job as the city-boy lost in the wild, but again outside of being given the \\"too-busy-to-enjoy-my-family\\" schtick, they don't really give him anything to do here. His decent into \\"survivalist\\" mode consists of his clothes getting wet and his hair getting messy. The best role in the film is reserved for Kevin Bacon as the heel. Playing the smarmy, backwoodsy killer who takes Streep and family hostage, Bacon does a great job in the film, and is the only reason I recommend giving this movie a spin in the DVD player. But surrounding him with a whiny kid, a dorky co-bad-guy, inept river police etc. and any edge of danger is sucked right out of the character.<br /><br />The ham-handed direction even sucks the beauty out of the landscape, and the menace out of the rapids. The musical score gets pumped up to ten and...blah. There is nothing surprising or inventive with the film. Take the dullest parts of \\"Deliverance\\", and expand them for an hour and half, and you have \\"The River Wild\\".
1416914307|5.0|This book couldn't be different from the others from this serie. Mesmerizing, haunting, thrilling and addictive.I loved all of them! I recommend!
0786939532|5.0|I actually started with book two at first.  Where I was in the world restricted my choices at the time.      This is a great book, just like the rest in the series.  If you read this book be prepared to buy the next one shortly after.  I had a hard time putting it down and finished it in a short few days.      Drizzt is a very complex and yet simple character.  This book is the beginning of his long journey.  The first in many adventures.  Be prepared to be drawn in and see the world that Drizzt lives in and feel his emotions.
1416914285|5.0|This book is addictive, beautiful, haunting and mesmerizing! It made me eager to find out what would happen in the next chapter and I simply couldn't stop reading! I totally loved it!
0393327655|5.0|This is quite possibly the most lucid and illuminating piece of literature I've ever held in my hands. It is a scripture unto itself, proposing a return to reason and true compassion. The world will never know peace until we can investigate religious theories without relying on blind faith and gossip. When we forsake human compassion, reason and our own inherent sense of right and wrong to assume stances, prejudices and positions which cannot be substantiated or supported, trouble is bound to follow.     As long as everyone in the world feels its okay to believe anything you like with no proof, evidence or tangible support, anyone, anywhere can make up their own religion and gods anytime and make them as hateful, jealous and destructive as they like and call it \\"good.\\" We must demand reason and proof as the currency of belief or the world will remain in conflict over story books and opinions.    We must return to an open, investigative mind so that we can begin to learn without operating on fairy tales, folk lore, dreams and antiquated books.
B002NHBNWW|5.0|Reminds us of Twillight, but has it's own twist.  Great story and parts played well.  Makes you want to believe in Vampires!
B001KPK6Q2|4.0|I am not a Taylor Swift fan, but my kids love her.  I have been hearing this album for the last year and could sing every song by heart.  I am not a country music fan (and neither are my kids), but this is an album that I think pop and country fans can agree on.  It's full of catchy songs and the production is good.      I think Taylor is a positive role model that parents can be proud to expose their kids to.  She is a class act and handles herself very well, especially for somebody so young.  I was also impressed to learn she wrote much of this album, which shows she is more than just another pretty face who can sing a little.  Actually, I think the songs are better than the performance here.  Whether or not they will stand the test of time, I don't know, but I do know I've probably heard this album 100 times or more over the last year.
0440242576|5.0|Delivery was on time and product was received in condition as stated in the ad.
0439023491|5.0|I love the second book as much as I loved the Hunger Games. I'm on the edge of my seat waiting with baited breath until the third book comes out. I can't believe I have to wait for a whole year...
B001M5UDGS|5.0|This was a great movie.  Enjoyable, easy to watch, just an all-round pleasant experience.  Nothing too heavy or deep - just fun.  There are so few movies like this - thank you for this one!
B0000524CY|4.0|To this day, this is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. Unlike many horror movies, it actually has a story to tell, which is brilliantly written by William Peter Blatty. Directed by William Friedkin. Starring a very young Linda Blair, who took on a really big role at a very young age, and did a fantastic job with it. Today's media has become so violent that many young viewers may not be terribly frightened by it. However, back in its day, this movie was cutting edge horror. Reports of fainting and hysteria were common place, believe it or not. Give it a try. It just may surprise you.
B000OVLBEY|5.0|The movie itself is fantastic.  And combine the price we purchased it for a good deal.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|I have listened to and watched this CD/DVD numerous times and don't tire of it. Mark Johnson was/is a genius to film these amazing multi-cultural street musicians, edit their voices onto some fantastic visual and audio pieces, and to initiate this growing, humanitarian movement. The recent documentary that aired on PBS, like this product, added inspiration to inspiraton. I'm elated to have tickets to see some of these immensely talented PFC imusicians perform together live in Boston as part of their fall tour. Grandpa Elliot and Clarence Bekker alone are worth the affordable ticket and CD/DVD price. Be sure to check out the Episodes on their website at [...] to see why I'm writing this rave review. This is one of the best purchases that I've ever made. Wish I were a musician and could join the tour!!Profits from this CD/DVD and concerts go to building music schools around the world. Two have aleady been completed in Africa. I hope millions around the world will support this growing movement that uses music to promote peace and harmony in the world.  What better cause could their be?
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|I just wanted a one disc, no extra features, cheap version of the movie.  and thats what this is. I got exactly what I wanted
B000VNMMQG|5.0|I really enjoyed this historical movie. Another view on laws and policy during this slavery period.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Absolutely loved this show. I bought it on a whim because of all the hype my friends created. Of course, they were right and I ended up loving it!! The characters are deep and warm, and the series is very entertaining while still touching on serious topics. Just an all-around great show.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|Product works well.  Good telescope, easy to read distance.  Size is not obtrusive. Easy to use. Negative - Has a weird 3 volt battery which requires a battery store for replacement.  I paid $9.50 for battery.  Original battery still working but I always carry a backup.
0778321606|5.0|I wanted this book for a book discussion group. It was cheap and in excellent condition. I enjoyed the book. It had contrasting characters and was thought provoking but still light reading.

0321127420|5.0|P of EAA is a bible for Enterprise Design Patterns.The patterns described in the book have become industry best practices with a lot of sources referring to these and providing solutions around these patterns.I would place this book in the category of best pattern books of all time along with the GOF and POSA.It is worth mentioning that anyone working on Enterprise Application Architecture will find this book as a very important weapon-one without which its difficult to win the battle-in their armory.
0545123267|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Her writing is very poetic and I found the way she wrote her love story very beautiful.  For those who enjoy this type of book it is a must read.  Even those who just enjoy love stories will probably enjoy this.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|If you've never watched Breaking Bad, you are missing out on one of the best series that has hit the waves.  Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are excellent and interact so well with each other.  You will definitely get hooked if you watched one episode. Excellent writing.
B000WBZZ5W|3.0|You know from the outset of a Die Hard movie that the bad guys are going to get what's coming to them and those who have bonded with Bruce Willis will be OK in the end.  Bruce doesn't display a lot of range as an actor, but has found a niche in these athletic action dramas.  In Die Hard 4, we have an interesting buddy bonding between baby boomer Bruce and an X-generation geek, played by Justin Long.  The plot is simple enough. Bruce has been sent to escort a young computer hacker back to FBI headquarters for a bit of face time with the hierarchy.  Bruce is action man, disinclined to worry too much about subtle human interaction, who embodies the old virtues of duty and patriotism. The geek, however, is perhaps disillusioned, timid, and self absorbed.  When Bruce hooks up with him, they are assailed by some very heavy dudes (led by Timothy Olyphant), armed with more military hardware than on display at a Soldier of Fortune convention.  The action graphics following are outstanding.  Of course Bruce and the geek manage to close the generation gap after killing a hundred men and slaying the metaphorical dragon together, the geek emerging as \\"that guy\\", which I suppose is equivalent to a knighthood in days of yore.  If you love action films, this is a must see.
B000ZTJ9DU|5.0|I honestly did not want to read any of these, coming off of my Sharon Kay Penman books.  I Could not find anything else to read at the time.  Diane Galbaldon has led me on a path to find out more about Scotland and it's people.  I now want to move to Scotland because of her.  Galbaldon's style of writing is comparable to Jane Austin, (but modern).  You will laugh, think, and cry.  I consumed her books, and am waiting for Echo in the Bone to come out.  Jamie and Claire have touched my heart and soul, as does Brianna and Roger.  A sweeping saga of life in Scotland during and after the Culledon Battle, and up to pre revolutionary war in the states.  Some of you may say, oh, come on, time travel?  Once you get past that you'll love this series.
0061367036|5.0|a iam a tru fan of the show and love the book it really broke down all that john went through and learned and it piggy backed on the comics and the show very well
0385341008|5.0|Love! Yes, love best describes my affection for the persons in this novel. Oh, and admiration for the unique format the author used to bring them to life. The skill with which the story unfolded not only informed me of the location and the period of history; it also made me care about a part and place in history that had escaped my notice. I am the richer for the discovery and I have passed the find to all my children and a number of friends. They have reported that they have done the same.
B000K0NGN8|5.0|I was on a \\"classic\\" book binge this summer. This was the last on my list and it was the perfect way to wind down after books like \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\", \\"The Great Gatsby\\" and \\"The Bell Jar\\".

B0027VTMAE|1.0|No matter what you think about \\"The Ninth Gate\\" as a story, the film's flaws are overshadowed by Darius Khondji's remarkable photography; in fact, that was one of two reasons I bought it on DVD when it came out: the visuals AND the fetishistic detail to the books (typefaces, engravings, and the sound the pages made when they turned...mmmmm).  So I rented the Blu-ray version of the film to see if it was worth buying.    DEAR. GOD.  This may very well be the worst Blu-ray transfer I have EVER seen thus far.  Even worse that the legendary Digital Noise-riddled \\"Terminator 2\\" Blu-Ray.  I barely got through my favorite 10 minutes of the film before I shut the whole thing off and took it back.  The transfer is an UGLY washed out, aged-looking, and GRAINY-AS-ALL-GET-OUT P.O.S. and it's the only digital-age disc I've actually felt CHEATED on (even early-era DVDs had sharper advantages over video...plus you knew better re-releases would follow when DVD technology picked up, but at this point in technology this is inexcusable).    I cannot recommend a Blu-ray title LESS than this one.  For me, Blu-ray is about the VIDEO and AUDIO, not about the film itself.  Even if I think a movie sucks, I'll commend it if the Blu-ray transfer is good (I own \\"Transformers\\" for cryin' out loud), because that's what people want to know.  But even at $9 this disc is a total rip-off and the studio should have known better than to release this to the public.  I will wait for the re-issue...but not with bated breath.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Great adaption.  I loved the Timothy Dalton version from Masterpiece Theatre as well, which was more dramatic, and quite a bit heavier. Ruth Wilson & Toby Stephens are wonderful in their parts, and are more sensitive & light hearted.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|This is an awesome series. There is so much actual dialogue they incorporated from the actual missions.
B000TGGJKK|4.0|I like this movie (even though I've never been a Brad Pitt fan), and enjoy the added length.  I'm not sure why the soundtrack was 'enhanced' for this release (the 'Director's Cut' I happen to have the HD-DVD version) [[ASIN:B000E5KJI4 Troy [HD DVD]]].<br />  In particular, I love the fight scene between Achilles and Hector.  I think it's one of the best I've seen in ANY movie, of it's genre (including \\"Gladiator\\") and I liked the sparse musical background, which basically consisted of what sounded like bongos, or some kind of drum instrument.<br />  Now on this Director's Cut it's full orchestration, building to a huge musical climax.<br />  I find it distracting, and still go back to the original version (DVD) to watch that fight scene.  Otherwise, I give the movie in general 5 stars.<br />  Incidentally, if you like Helen, you get to see a little bit MORE of her in this Director's Cut, if you know what I mean...*wink, wink, nudge, nudge* say no more. [[ASIN:B000TGELLY Troy - Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]
B000K15VSA|5.0|OK I will admit it right up front. I am a \\"Blade Runner\\" geek. I can quote lines from the original script and I am reasonably fluent in CitySpeak. This groundbreaking film is now available in a set that allows the viewer to understand all of the details of the production with the wonderful \\"making of\\" content that is included. If this does not interest you in the least, skip this, you are not the intended buyer. Just purchase the \\"final cut\\" DVD or BD disk and save some money.<br />If you are interested in the minutia associated with this magnificent production, buy this set today. It is well done and although the \\"signed letter\\" from Sir Ridley is nothing more than a piece of plastic (very cool, nonetheless) you do get a silver plastic origami unicorn that Gaff would be proud of included in this set.<br />The packaging is very neat but it is only fluff stuff and probably not of any particular value. The DVD's of all versions and the extras DVD's are worth the money. If that is not enough there are lovely pre-vis drawings from the artist responsible for the look of this strange future world of Los Angeles. These are suitable for framing should you wish.<br />The \\"spinner toy car\\" is also kind of neat but also a cheaply made toy. The jewel of this collection lies in the DVD's included and not the packaging but as far as I know this is the only way you can get the entire set of DVD's.<br />Lo fa, negoje man.Devaja blade, blade runner.<br />If you even have the slightest idea of what this means, then yup... you are the right guy! You should buy this set.
B002436WJE|5.0|Great service and DVD.I still haven't loaded my digital copy as yet due to some of my technical issues, but we've watched regular copy multiple times and never a flaw.Thanks Rickey
B002436WFI|3.0|I Liked this movie because of the campy humor, but it is not for everyone. The graphics were well done too!
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I received my box set so quickly from Amazon and it was packaged very well. Box sets somtimes arrive in damaged shape but not with Amazon! They can package very well ahd ship fast! Thank you!    No longer are the MFSL albums the best source for quality Beatles Music. They are now \\"Outdated Technology\\". Anyone who tells you different either has some records to sell or they still churn their own butter.    It had to happen sooner or later. The quality of sound is so superior to anything else available previously plus you don't have to deal with surface noise which is incurred during the playing of an MFSL album. And, you don't have to worry about needle scratches, scuffs, warps, dish, and any other anomoly. Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs has been great over the past 20 years but it is now \\"Old School\\" by comparison to these CDs. So, if you want to listen to an MFSL album over these CDs, well, if you have the time and don't mind the hassle then great.     I was worried initally that we'd end up with engineers being \\"Cute\\" during the remastering process. But common sense prevailed and we finally have a product that is of utmost quality both in sound and convenience!
B0013KUL8M|4.0|This was my first introduction to Tim Roth, and now I own most of his DVDs.  He is an actor's actor and I loved his directorial debut \\"the War Zone\\" and am presently reading the book by Alexander Stuart.<br /><br />I don't wish to give away the ending, bit I thought he was marvelous.  His humble beginnings began at sea (the Atlantic ocean) where he was abandoned and raised by the crew aboard.  He was a child prodigy, whereas, at about the age of 7 or 8 walked over to the piano and started playing \\"magically\\" as a professional musician, music that was alive in his head.  As he became a grown man, he played nightly, to the guest's amazement.  He would also entertain those less fortunate in steerage.<br /><br />He was kind, empathetic, sincere, intelligent and witty.  I personally, fell in love with his character and wish this would have been a  book, so I could have really gotten into his heart, soul and mind.<br /><br />He bonded and had a great friendship and rapport with the actor who played the trumpet in the band.  He seemed to appreciate his music and the man he was, more than anyone.  His life was sadly, lonely and sort of out of touch with \\"reality\\", in the terms of life on land.  The only life which was familiar and \\"real to him' was life aboard an ocean liner.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I am having trouble, putting into words  all the emotion in the movie.  It was extremely moving and I found it surprising, that is didn't receive the credit it deserved.  I still, think of it often and find it so very moving and wish I could have known a person as the character he portrayed.<br /><br />By the the way, I own the CD. which is available through Amazon.  I have viewed it numerous times and am still intrigued by it.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I purchased this soundtrack for my daughter who is obsessed with Twilight. She listens to this soundtrack all the time. When we go somewhere, even somewhere very close, she always puts this cd in the car. This is her favorite soundtrack. I personally like the soundtrack. It has great music. My daughter loves all the songs! I would recommend this soundtrack to anyone who loves music.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|Let me first say that I am a huge fan, and tend to lean towards the stereo versions of the Beatles recordings.      That being said, there is no comparison that this is the better set.  Each disc is just a shrunk version of the original mono LP pressings - even the fold around the back of the covers is like how it was done on the British discs in the 60's.  Also, MMT includes the entire booklet (which the Stereo set lacks).  And for the first time the mono Yellow Submarine EP is available here.    The sound is so good that if anyone is looking to buy the 1987 compact discs, shoot me an email cause I don't need them!
B000GCFY0I|4.0|When I got this book I didn't realize there were such different reviews on it.  Most people either loved it or hated it.  I thought it was a terrific read.  Interesting story that held my attention throughout the book.  Good characters and the dialogue was well done.     I thought some of the ways things were referred to were kind of dumb (uglies, pretties, littlies), but other than I enjoyed reading it.      I was disappointed that it isn't a stand-alone novel.  There is absolutely no ending in the book, it just stops.  There  are a few book that are written that way, so it's not all that unusual, but books like that at least resolve something, they don't just end abruptly.
B00003CX9W|5.0|This was to replace one lost in the flood of Katrina for my daughter....glad to have it!

B00005JM02|5.0|Got it as a replacement for one lost in the recent flood; great price and my daughter will love it when I give it to her.
0385341008|5.0|Having no expectations prior to reading the book I was thouroughly delighted.  The characters unfolded through a series of letters. Their personalities & lives are revealed so intimately and vividly, that I too, felt I was part of their lives, and wanted to become a member of the Book club myself. I was swept up by every emotion, and didn't want the book to end.  I find myself missing  and thinking about all of the characters...still.
B001GZ6QEC|3.0|I like this movie very much, but I don't understand why so many people rate it so high?  As good as people make it out to be, it is not flawless.  It was well done, and there are some great scenes, but it is LONG and does drag, especially after seeing it more than once.  Yes, Ledger was good, but Bale was only so-so.  Unlike 1989's Batman, Nicholson was able to carry the WHOLE film as the villian, and that just isn't so here.  For one thing, the Joker doen't have nearly as much screen time, again though he is very good in every scene he is in.  I just get confused when people are saying \\"it's the best movie ever\\", or even \\"the best of 2008\\".  It's a very good movie, but NOT a perfect movie.
B00001QEE9|5.0|This is an absolute gem of a movie.  I loved it as a kid and I love having it to show to my kids now as a parent.    It's a timeless story with timeless values.  Jiminy Cricket's \\"When you Wish Upon a Star\\" is still a great song.    Make sure you keep the legacy of this movie alive by showing it to your children or grandchildren.  They'll love it too.  And that's no lie!
B002BSHXJA|5.0|This is a beautiful box in everyway, from the booklet notes, to the artwork and of course the beautiful remastering of these original mono recordings. These were the mixes the Beatles participated in, thus making the mono box essential.
B002GTZSZU|4.0|I saw this movie awhile back and it was an amazing movie. I just have one question what is the difference between this version and the Booklet style bluray that has already been released? Is it WB just double dipping again or does this version of the film have a better transfer than the previous one?
B0009S2T0M|1.0|I was bored out of my mind when I watched this film. The \\"cinematic\\" quality is there, in terms of effects and editing, but the plot was poorly adapted and made it come off like it was from a badly-written comic book. I just found the whole thing contrived, implausible, and dry. There's very little done, wether in the directing, or the screenplay, to make you care about the far-fetched plot.
B001RE9HF2|5.0|This is a very long opera at 227 minutes but very worth the viewing effort.  The cast is brilliant, particularly the lovely Danielle De Niese, and the production directed by David Mcvicar is quite unique.  There is clever comedy, dance and drama to the excellent music on original instruments from the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment conducted by William Christie.<br />The BD set includes two extra documentaries which add another 78 minutes, one featuring Danielle De Niese and the other detailing the enthusiasm of the cast and director for this Handel masterpiece. These are worthwhile viewing, preferrably before commencing the opera itself.<br />The costuming is generally modern and somewhat quirky but the artistry is so good it is not a distraction. However some aspects such as props of pistol and rifles and background pictures of warships and blimps did seem unecessarily gimmicky.<br />Overall it is Handel at his best, interpreted by an inspired cast of superb singers and actors with excellent audio and video quality. This set is a must for serious opera lovers.
B000VPUIA6|5.0|Simply put, Help! Deluxe edition strikes a home run in the box set department.  Besides the hard cover book with never before seen pictures from the making of the film, you get a facsimile copy of the script (real handy for those occasions when you need to tuck something important looking under your arm in the subway) and other posters and copies of theater cards.  Make Help! Deluxe Edition the one you buy for any Beatle fan.
1416583408|3.0|\\"Inside of a Dog\\" introduces readers to the science of the dog, not anecdotal tales anthropomorphizing their pets. A good goal, but just too dry for me.<br /><br />Much of the material, not surprisingly, compares dogs with wolves or human babies. We learn that wolves are better at solving physical puzzles, dogs at people skills. Dogs make eye contact, wolves avoid it. Wolves and dogs share all but one-third of 1% of their DNA.<br /><br />Human noses have about 6 million sensory receptor sites, while beagle noses have over 300 million. It is estimated that their sense of smell is millions of times better than humans (I'm thinking that's a very good thing). Trained dogs can tell identical twins apart by scent. They can also detect fear, adrenaline, various diseases and cancers (research has found trained dogs more reliable at identifying melanomas than most dermatologists - cheaper, too).<br /><br />Only about 20% of dog urination is 'marking' - sometimes they just have to go, or they're leaving behind messages.<br /><br />Humans hear from 20 hertz to 20 khertz, dogs up to 45 khertz. They respond more to tone than words; one dog involved in research distinguishes between 200 toys by name, and can pick out new ones when asked.<br /><br />Dogs have different barks for different situations.<br /><br />Wolves are adept at noticing motion, and can see well in low light, as can dogs. Both have wider fields of vision (250 - 270 degrees) than humans (180 degrees). Only blue and greenish-yellow receptors are in dogs eyes, making them less able to discriminate among colors than humans. Dogs see via a succession of individual photos at about 70 - 80 hertz, vs. humans at about 60 or less, Thus, for older TVs with a refresh rate of eg. 60 hertz, dogs see flashes of dark in between scenes (Maybe you should upgrade your TV for your dog.)<br /><br />Unfortunately, \\"Inside of a Dog\\" then progressively continues with more and more arcane detail (eg. telling us which side of a human's face they are most likely to look at first, which person they focus on for clues in determining the bucket in which food is hidden, etc.), telling us that having their tail down indicates fear or submission (duh!), and telling less and less (eg. bored animals pace, chew and throw things).they focus on for clues in determining the bucket in which food is hidden, etc.), telling us that having their tail down indicates fear or submission (duh!), and telling less and less (eg. bored animals pace, chew and throw things).

B00009APK1|4.0|I am very happy with my movie. The Two Towers is my favorite, so I was happy to add this to my collection of DVD's.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|First of all, I should mention that I've never read the book series.  And so, I cannot comment on which of the two I liked best.    Secondly, I will admit most of the negative comments I've read (particularly about the show being very graphic) are well founded.  But then again, this is HBO, right?  Definitely not for kids...and probably not for many adults either.    I like vampires, werewolves, and the boogeyman...and so, I liked this show very much.  Think of this as the HBO version of Twilight.    I didn't care much for Sookie.  I was one of those un-fun people who couldn't help but think she was stupid for getting involved with Bill.  I must have been the only person who didn't think it was cute or romantic at all.  But still, it was a good story.  I can't really say I cared much for any of the characters either.  I'm pretty sure Sam and Tara were the only characters I liked.  But even so, it was fun to watch and I enjoyed every episode.    I'm looking forward to season 2 on DVD.  I don't really care what happens in season 2; I just want to see more.
B001CD6MA6|4.0|This was a fun little movie. We saw it at the theater and ended up buying it because it's a great whenever flick with enough sillyness for little kids and enough graphic for bigger kids. The plot is not so much, but it's entertaining just the same.
B001TH16DI|5.0|For the asking price on Amazon, nearly half the original price, this is a huge deal for the sorts of things normally accumulated in Blu Ray collections.<br /><br />Without reviewing the individual movies (You can see me do that in the DVD versions.  Except \\"The Motion Picture\\", because quite frankly, the Director's Cut by all accounts was a huge difference and improvement), I'll just say that despite Wrath of Khan being claimed to be the only TRULY digitally remastered and true Blu Ray quality, it actually looks among the worst of them all.  Though that's not saying it looks like trash---it looks incredible, of course.  But compared to the others, \\"Wrath of Khan\\" has the most visual dirt and detractments.<br /><br />Some of the others, though, look as though they were remastered from the DVD versions, in that they seem to feel artificially boosted in picture quality.  I think that's only my own opinion, based entirely upon two scenes from \\"Search for Spock\\" and a few from \\"The Final Frontier\\", but for the most part, they are all incredible.  And despite what another reviewer says, \\"The Voyage Home\\" does not look overly muted in color; it's the same as all the others.<br /><br />All the discs start with the same trailers for Star Trek (2009) and Star Trek Season 1 on Blu Ray.  Despite what people say, these were totally skippable for me, just by pressing \\"Next\\".  I'm on a Sony Blu Ray player, so this may just be something only I am able to do.<br /><br />The sound quality is mostly great, but I've found for the majority of the films, there's the problem of what I saw prominently in the Star Wars Trilogy DVD release in 2004---the dialogue switches back and forth at times from sounding Stereo to Mono.  This might not affect most people, but due to my highly sensitive hearing, it's rather jarring to hear the traditional Mono track sound of Kirk saying something, then all of a sudden, his next lines are in Stereo, which sounds much closer, clearer, and digital.<br /><br />I can't really explain it further, but the most precise example of this I can recommend is from the original 2004 DVD of \\"Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope\\"---in the scene where Luke is training with Obi-Wan on the Millenium Falcon, and Han Solo walks in saying they don't have to worry about the Imperial cruisers anymore.  That line is in Mono.  Immediately afterwards, he says \\"Don't everybody thank me at once\\" which is in Stereo.<br /><br />Perhaps it's my own opinion after not being badly turned off from \\"The Final Frontier\\" but the only film which suffers the most is \\"The Motion Picture\\".  Due to its not being the Director's Cut, the vast majority of the visual effects range from \\"Decent for it's time\\" to a complete catastrophe.  While the gaseous cloud surrounding V'ger in the opening sequence looked real enough, when the Klingon Birds of Prey flew over them, it completely ruined the effect, due to the ships having VERY THICK black outlines, and scratchiness across the darker portions of it.  The worst, though, would have to be the scene Scotty and Kirk going aboard the Enterprise on a shuttle, and giving us a shot of them from the outside.  Their images look like the front of the shuttle has an old TV on it, broadcasting an image of the two of them, and it looks extremely jarring against the rest of the shot.<br /><br />As well, the same problems plagueing the Season 1 Blu Rays plague much of the movies---the music and sound effects are loud as hell, and the dialogue is very quiet in comparison.  This reaches its worst peak in \\"The Final Frontier\\".<br /><br />Special features abound, including most of those from the 2-disc DVD releases.

0064407667|1.0|I found this book to be very disappointing, as the characters seemed uni-dimensional and the storyline quite predictable. It does not stretch the imagination -- or even simply take the reader on a fun adventure. With so many great children's books available, I would not recommend spending precious time with this one.

B0007P0LO8|4.0|Not having read the brief message on the back of the cover, it came as a surprise that this was a film not a photographed live performance. The opening scene, as some reviewers have pointed out, was hardly an inducement to stay the course. (It showed a disheveled Pinkerton in T-Shirt running out of what we learn is his Japanese house, obviously in the grip of strong emotions for whose cause all who know the story of Madame Butterfly immediately register.) Customarily, I do not like filmed versions much preferring photographed live performances.  To be fair, I did not mind the unmoving mouths indicating introspective rather than objectified expression. What I did mind was the failure to take advantage of the possibilities inherent in film making but denied to the stage. This lack of adventurousness made for a lack of vigor and creativity in the production.  Yet, regardless of being an example of routine film-making, I had quite a good time. The reason is simple enough: the ravishing music by Puccini, which never goes stale, and the top-notch singing by the two stars, Domingo as Pinkerton, Freni as Butterfly. Having the likes of Christa Ludwig in support strengthened the positive response. Frankly, while I would have preferred seeing them sing live, with all its risks, but yet with its spark of spontaneity, I still could not resist that music, so endowed with the spirit of love dominant and love betrayed.If you have seen numerous versions of the opera, probably you should pass on this one and take another look at a production with which you are familiar. If you have never seen the opera in full, or have seen it only a few times, it is quite likely this will provide you with a most satisfying experience.

0385341008|5.0|This was a most delightful and fascinating book. I was enthralled with the characterizations and with the story itself.  But even more, I was very impressed with the skill of the author(s)in telling the story through correspondence between all the individual characters and Juliet, the main character.  Ms. Shaffer, through the correspondence exchanged, was able to unfold a story in an intuitive and unique way that brings each character to life, revealing their individual personalities, while weaving in their experiences living under the  deprivations of war on the island of Guernsey.  I was informed, intrigued, and at the same time moved by this reading experience.  It is definitely at the top of my list!
B000G0O5N2|5.0|There are a plethora of reviews of the movie, but my review is mostly a comparison of the BD vs DVD version.<br /><br />The DVD version was quite good, but the BD version is great.  Its audio does not have the imaging of HBO's Band of Brothers, but its still a good use of a wider sound stage with sound quality FAR above DVD.<br /><br />The BD transfer still has the grain and high contrast that was how the movie was shot.  However, the details are far sharper and clearer, so many of the background elements have more detail given the higher quality of BD.<br /><br />The greater details make snafus much clearer: in the final scene of  Durant's downed chopper, the same assaulting Somali rebels are seen attacking and are killed twice in 2 separate attacks; in the end where Hartnett is reviewing fallen comrades in the morgue, one of the bodies starts moving his eyeballs; in many scenes direct lines of site are made with weapons pointing at targets and despite a hail of gunfire, nothing is hit nor bullets impact the area.  Considering the marksmanship caliber of these troops, it was distracting.  By contrast, in Saving Private Ryan, or Band of Brothers, a view through weapons was succeeded soon by the effect of fire hitting the area viewed.<br /><br />Disk extras are identical to the DVD version but there is a commentary track with some living veterans of the event.  The veterans suggest events on almost every other scene is less true, but they do say that the spirit and most key events are true.  For example, the Durant rescue is close to true, but the depiction of what the Somali's do to the rescuers bodies are not.  The General was never hands on the radio during the entire battle, and the actions on ground depicted by Hartnett's character was actually done by another officer. These veterans testimony are in stark contrast to the book author and screen writer, who suggest most of the movie depictions are factual.

New Moon of the Twilight series was the first book to ever make me cry...and this SHIVER was the 2nd. Loved the story. Loved the characters and how it draws you in to their desperation and adventure. You feel and see what they do. Very well written. Cannot wait to read the other books she's written. YOU WILL NOT be disappointed in this book. Happy reading :)
B0002S947K|5.0|like so many pop stars who're shoved down our throats at every turn?  I've never heard one of his songs on the radio. That's a travesty!  Honestly, people, what is going on with the dumbing down of America when it comes to music?  This man has real talent.  Something you can sink your teeth into.  Every song on this CD is a gem.  And they're all different.  His style is eclectic, which I love.  His gritty, soulful voice truly touches every emotion.  Yes, I'm gushing.  And there's no shame in it when you're telling the truth!  Listen to the title song, TROUBLE and you'll swear his heart is breaking.  Listen to SHELTER and you'll swear YOUR heart is breaking.  Then move on to HOLD YOU IN MY ARMS and you don't care that your heart is breaking just as long as he'll sing a few more songs to you. Just to you. LOL!<br /><br />Seriously, get this CD.  You'll be as delighted with it as I am.  Unless you actually like that pop music on the radio.

B0028DRGDQ|4.0|[REC] is the movie the 2008 [[ASIN:B001MVYUR0 Quarantine]] was based on, and while I liked Quarantine, I feel that the original is superior.       A female reporter with a Spanish nightly news show regularly goes on assignment with her cameraman, taking the viewer behind the scenes of some profession or situation; in this case, a night in the life of the firefighters at a local station.  Thus the movie begins as if it were an unedited reel of this kind of documentary, complete with mistakes and start-overs that would have been excised if the tapes had ever made it to air in a conventional fashion.  Most nights the firefighters don't end up responding to an actual fire; sometimes they're called out for an animal rescue, or to assist a person who's taken a bad fall, or something else of that nature; other times the entire evening is spent at the station hanging around, playing basketball in the court, making small talk.  The prospects of the reporter, Angela (Manuela Velasco) following the crew on anything especially splashy seems low, although the firefighters themselves seem good-naturedly enthusiastic about having a young, attractive reporter in the firehouse to be interviewed by, relieving the repetiveness of most nights's routine.       When a call comes in for assistance to a nearby apartment building where an elderly lady is apparantly either ill or injured in her apartment and unco-operative (perhaps highly confused) with the neighbors trying to coax her out, the station sends a truck out on this routine call, with Angela and her cameraman along for the ride.  Little does anyone know that this call is going to end up being anything but routine, and in the most terrifying way.  The firetruck arrives at a scene where the situation is already beginning to spin out of control; the police are there and aren't too thrilled to see reporters on the scene, and the situation with the woman upstairs is about to turn ugly.  Angela senses some kind of story in this, andinstructs the cameraman to keep filming.       Now, here's where the movie jumps its first big hurdle.  When this technique of 'recovered tape capturing everything because the character was filming it' started to be used frequently, back with movies like [[ASIN:B00001QGUM The Blair Witch Project]], it worked because it was fresh.  The reasoning of keeping the cameras going seemed to work in that one, where it was a student documentary project, and keeping the camera going somehow kept the strange happenings on somewhat familiar ground, made it slightly easier because there was something else to focus on, gave them film to go over later and try and find their way out of the woods they were increasingly lost in, etc.  But the 'camera' theme has been used a few too many times.  I liked [[ASIN:B0014Z4OQG Cloverfield]], but thought it would have been better if they hadn't used the videocamera theme, or, perhaps, had used it for say, half the movie and gone the rest of the time with a more conventional approach (i.e. maybe having a surviving character recount events to the authorities for that part, and use the videocamera angle for an earlier portion of the movie representing a character who doesn't survive?)  Anyway, even though this technique has lost a lot of steam, '[REC]' made it work again, and it pulled out every trick it had to to get it working.  There are times when the scene is pitch dark, and the night light on the camera's eyepiece is the only way for a character to find their way about - they can then try to guide other characters who still can't see clearly.  There are times when the camera has actually been turned off and left on the floor, and a little child comes over to play around with it, turning it on in the process, and then leaving it running where it ends up filming things nobody even intended to film.  Even the way when the cameraman is running he'll end up hitting the camera on the wall and the audio goes out for some time, until a second bumpjars it back on.  All this helps [REC] completely clear the hurdle facing movies like this, which is the \\"Why don't they just forget about the bloody camera and Run?\\" hurdle.  Working especially on this point, Angela and several others begin to think that some kind of massive coverup is going on, and then there's a tangible reason why documenting everything is so important.        The reason a coverup is suspected is simple: just after the abrupt, violent confrontation with the supposedly ill (but now ragingly homicidal) woman upstairs, the building is abruptly sealed off by security forces from the outside.  It's supposedly strictly a 'precaution' until health officials can arrive.  The firemen, the police, Angela and her cameraman, and the residents of the apartment building soon have more to fear than trying to figure out why the authorities are doing this, as other people - starting with a cop who was bitten by the berserk woman, start to turn the same way.  Unable to leave the building - police riflemen are actually in position to shoot if anyone tries to break out through the upstairs windows until they're covered over with some heavy barrier - the situation escalates into total pandemonium.       Quarantine followed this movie very closely - not shot for shot all the time, but a fair bit of it - right up until the last fifteen minutes or so, which is where [REC] really distinguishes itself.  Looking for shelter and means of defence anywhere they can find it, several characters find themselves in a long-unused apartment on the top floor.  This happens in both movies, but what they find up there - and what it reveals or implies about the origin of this situation - in my opinion, [REC]'s end stage is incredibly potent and makes the movie even scarier; Quarantine's is a bit anticlimatic.  [REC]'s final act is totally horrifying and surprising on multiple levels.  Not trying to bash Quarantine, which was well done, and as for the fact that the ending was different - well, if you're not going to do Some things different, why do a remake?  [[ASIN:B00005JLTK The Ring (Widescreen Edition)]] and the 2007 [[ASIN:B000VKL6Z2 Halloween - Unrated Director's Cut (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)]], for example, changed some things around and took different paths here and there, so they and their predecessors are similar but distinct.  On the other hand, [[ASIN:159582071X Ju-On]] and the 2004 [[ASIN:B0006SGYL0 The Grudge]] are practically the same movie, just one's in Japanese and one's in English (the sequels to each were Very different to one another though).  But while Quarantine was a good movie, I think [REC] is definately the stronger and scarier of the pair.  Tremendous special effects, fine acting and characterization, and some of the most unnerving, unnatural Howls erupting from the bestial killers you can imagine, make this a great addition to the powerful recent crop of Spanish horror.  Incidentally, although [REC] only got its North American debut recently, [REC] 2 has already been filmed and is going to start playing overseas within the next couple of months, so we can hope it won't take as long for this one to be released worldwide.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|If your a fan of anything Sci-Fi, you should love this. Serenity is the movie spin-off of the short-lived cult series Firefly. Taking place shortly after the series, Serenity offers all the great things that made the series what it was. Action, Adventure, Drama, Horror Romance, Comedy...It's all here! Gene Roddenberry, the creator of Star Trek would have loved this movie. When it comes to \\"Space Westerns\\", this is the best one ever!
1400063736|2.0|I read this book of related short stories (not a novel) to the end bacause I was so sure, given the Amazon editors' rating, that the author would redeem himself and show why he chose to tell these stories out of the multitude of stories that could actually have had some connection to the skywalk.  No such luck.  I resent the time I gave up to wade through all the showy and showoffy writing (though some of it is genuinely good: just enough to keep you hoping.)    There have been many novels in recent years in which the writing served the story and the setting, novels that challenge and teach in the telling: Mr. Pip by Lloyd Jones, The Gift of Rain by Tan Twan Eng, The Solitude of Thomas Cave by Georgina Harding, The Story of Edgar Sawtelle to name just a few.  Let the Great World Spin suffers mightily by comparison.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|This is one of the best series' I've ever seen!! It is DEFINITELY worth the price, which is extremely reasonable on Amazon--about half of what it was going for in the stores!!      True TrueBlood Fan  :)
B00005RYKV|1.0|After purchasing this item and getting charged about $40 AUS postage the DVD was not compatible with Australian DVD players. Conveniently you cannot return the product after it has been opened. As I could not test the DVD's compatibility until after I opened it, this return policy was no good to me.  You are better off taking your chances with Ebay!!!
B0025KVLTC|5.0|For those wondering if the remastered Revolver is worth buying, I say yes. I bought it today and despite all the hype was still impressed with the sound quality. Even on a good car sound system, the difference is obvious. On a home audio system, the improvement is more striking.     I haven't heard the other remasters, but I have to believe they're all worth the cost for serious Beatles fans. All the little things the Beatles did to make their songs great can now be heard as clearly as your ears can hear them.
159562015X|3.0|I took the online quiz and revealed my \\"Top 5\\" strengths, which is nicely accompanied by proactive action items to enhance those strengths, but am very curious just how \\"Top\\" these Top 5 are.  After reading through the book, it seems like at least 3 or 4 more strengths must've been very close to being Top 5 also.  I don't want to miss any of my strengths...  How do I know whether my Top 6-10 scored one point below the rest or many points?  Also, there's only one access code per book for one single person -- my wife and I would really like to know her strengths too!  I wouldn't mind a discounted purchase for another access code, but that's not offered.  Does that mean I should go out and buy another copy of the book just for another code, then put all of that new paper right into the trashcan or donate pile?  Poor trees and poor thrift shop buyers who also then have no access code...<br /><br />Wait a minute!  I'm smelling a very smart, yet subtle, price hook here...  Hey, can you tell me how I can build a website where every single person pays +$13 to view five singular, customized words of character after spending near 30 minutes answering questions to add their personal, demographic, and statistical data into my own private database?  ...And don't personal surveys normally work the other way around anyway, where the survey company seeks and pays people to take their survey, then reveals their complete results to them at completion?!

B001QWBM62|3.0|After reading so many glowing reviews about the H4n I decided to order one.  I already have an Edirol R-09, a Tascam DR-07, plus a Korg D4 digital recorder.   After trying the Zoom H4n for just a bit I decided to return it although it does have some nice features.  What put me off was the overall size.  It is a very big unit when compared to other hand held \\"pocket recorders\\" such as the Edirol R-09.  On the other hand the screen on the H4n is large and easy to read and gives out good information such as the exact record and output levels between 1 and 100.    In addition to the large size of the recorder, I didn't care for the line input being on the bottom of the unit.  This was really cumbersome to me as I often record directly from my computer out into the digital recorder.   I had to set the H4n on a miniature tripod to make room for the stereo line input, or lay it on it's side.  This seemed a bit precarious.    What really was the deal breaker for me was the battery life which seems to be shorter than claimed.   I can get about 4 hours out of the Roland, and 6 hours out of the Tascam.  I can't say for sure, but I suspect you would be lucky to get 2 hours out of the Zoom when using rechargeable batteries.  It's obvious why they include an external power supply with the unit.  It's possible this recorder would be better off with a hefty Lithium-ion battery of the type used in small video cameras.    Apparently many people like the Zoom H4n, but given the fact that it was so large and seemingly cumbersome for my purposes I decided to return it.  If you want simplistic digital recording in a hand held unit, I suggest you try the Tascam DR-07 as it gives good results, is easy to use, and is about 1/2 the price of the H4n.  If you are a professional musician with a van who is already hauling a lot of heavy equipment, and want a big hefty unit to use on stage, the Zoom could be just the ticket.
B002AT4K9G|4.0|This is an excellent movie if you liked the rest of the movies in this series. There were only two things that I didn't like about this movie. Number one is the fact that Vins girlfriend dies so soon into the movie.Even though it sets up the storyline for the rest of the movie it made me sad. The second thing  is just a jealousy thing and that is the fact that those classic muscle cars get trashed. Over all this is great movie.

B0025KVLT2|4.0|I just bought several of the 2009 remastered Beatles CD's, including \\"Rubber Soul\\".  I have all of the Beatles original albums on vinyl, and this is my first foray into re-buying their music on CD.  So, until I started listening to their early albums in the new 2009 remastered CD format, I really wasn't aware of the sound issues of \\"mono\\" vs. \\"stereo\\" engineering.  My old vinyl albums of their early work were all in \\"mono\\", and that's the sound I was used to and grew up with.  Much to my surprise, the new CD's have a remarkably different sound on many tracks in the 2009 remastered \\"stereo\\" format.  In some cases, the sound seems much better, and I like the \\"new\\" versions much better than what I heard on the old \\"mono\\" recordings.  However, much to my dismay, quite a few of my favorite songs sound \\"strange\\" to me in the new remastered format.  After discovering this, I went back on-line and read other customer reviews of the 2009 remasters, and got an education (thanks to all of you!) on the \\"stereo\\" vs. \\"mono\\" engineering issue.    While I happened to be listening to \\"Rubber Soul\\", I found myself feeling especially frustrated with the sound of the \\"Nowhere Man\\" track.  It seemed to me that the BALANCE of the vocal track vs. the instrumental track was way out-of-whack, compared to how the song sounded on vinyl.  Frankly, I hated it, it sounded just plain \\"wrong\\"!  The voice track was very prominent, and the instrumental track was just so diminished, so that the song sounds really lame.  So, in my frustration, I went over to my stereo, and turned up the volume and then adjusted the balance control to lower the voice track and boost the instrumental track, and ... WOW !  Suddenly, the song sounded great, like I remembered it!  I've since gone back to other tracks that sounded \\"off\\" to me (like \\"Yesterday\\" on the \\"Help!\\" CD, or \\"I'm a Loser\\" on the \\"Beatles for Sale\\" CD), and discovered that if I adjust the balance on my stereo amplifier, they also sound much better andmore dynamic!    It seems to me that the new 2009 remastered versions over-emphasize the vocal-track component of the early Beatles recordings, and under-emphasize the instrumental-track component.  By adjusting the play-back balance, I can get the songs to sound \\"right\\" to me.  In fact, when I do this, the 2009 remastered songs sound really good (better than the old versions I grew up with).  It seems that the music (vocals and instrumental tracks) are \\"all there\\" on these CD's, it's just that the balance isn't \\"right\\" (or at least \\"right\\" to my ear!).    Has anyone else tried adjusting the play-back balance on these recordings?  I think it makes them sound much better, even if this is a bit \\"unorthodox\\" way of trying to get the \\"right\\" sound out of these recordings.
1572814349|5.0|I've had many many tarot decks in my time, but none as beautiful as the Golden Tarot. The artwork is a collage of medieval and Renaissance art that makes my heart beat faster! Every little detail is carefully added to help the reader understand the symbolism each card. Thus, I find it an excellent deck to read from and my customers are very pleased with their readings! The tarot cards are in a sturdy little box with a lift off lid, so easily accessible. The guide not only gives you detailed information on the meanings of the cards, but also supplies information on what art work was used for each card. I highly recommend this deck for those of you who love the artwork of this time period and want a hands on deck that \\"speaks\\" to you!
B00064WSOQ|4.0|This album was my first KC album after Three of a Perfect Pair. And wow, what a different sound! It seems to be a lot closer to their earlier sound than to the stuff of the 80's, in that it's a bit more \\"noisy.\\" However, it never really goes into the actual I'm-going-to-beat-your-ears-out-through-your-eyeballs levels that KC sometimes had.     I don't think that most of the songs are as creative as KC has done in the past, though. That's not to say they aren't good, it's just that there weren't as many moments where I could say \\"Wow, that was a new sound\\" as I've had on some of their other albums.     My favorites are Eyes Wide Open, Elektrik, and Happy With What You Have To Be Happy With. The last song is probably one of my favorite songs period, actually. The lyrics are some of Belew's best, and the sound is so different from anything KC has done(from what I've heard of them).     There's probably a lot of stuff I should be writing about in here, but I can't think of it right now. So I'll just say that if you are looking for a great KC album(but not a revolutionary one), you should definitely give this one a look.
B000021XS0|5.0|Hello. This album changed my musical life forever. Throughout high school I listened mainly to classic heavy metal bands, like Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Metallica, etc. Then one day while listening to this album while shingling my brother's roof, my life changed. Everything about this new  band Dream Theater seemed out of this world. The variety of sounds on SFAM just blew me away. The opening track gives a brief glimpse into what is to come in a very well put together and organized sort of way. The Strange Deja Vu hits you in a very heavy way. Through My Words Comes next and brings the mood down and very briefly shows a lighter side to the band. Fatal Tragedy is a very heavy yet touching song with a great solo section with interplay between Petrucci and Rudess. The next two tracks are on the lighter side with great melodies throughout. Home hits very hard. It will make you want to just bang your head, and put your dio fingers into the air. Enjoy the Phrygian Dominant! The Dance of Eternity is instrumental and will make you jaw drop. The Spirit Carries On is Dream Theaters greatest ballad in my opinion and is their arm sway, put your lighter/cell phone up song. The album ends with finally free and leaves the listener feeling completely blown away. If you're looking to get into the progressive metal genre, start here. It is for me and many others Dream Theater's best album. Some may not like Labries vocal style (I don't know where this album or band would be without him), but if you can get past that, the songwriting and unbelievable playing will leave you begging for more.

B001EHDWNK|3.0|I'm a bit of a latecomer to Robert Sawyer's speculative fiction, but I've generally enjoyed his books and his ideas. At least I did until I got to Flash Forward. I was interested in reading this book when I learned it was the basis for an upcoming series on ABC this fall. (By the way, it's apparent that the TV version will be very different than the book.)    Flash Forward should be a fascinating book. You have a worldwide event in which everyone falls unconscious for a couple of minutes and experiences what they'll be doing 21 years in the future. (Except for those who will be dead who see nothing or those who will be asleep who see only their dreams.) Unfortunately, with no advance warning of the event there are massive car pile-ups, plane crashes and all sorts of catastrophes big and small. Then everyone - or at least those who didn't suffer a fatal injury - wakes up.    When the world population realizes they've been given a glimpse of their future, things get complicated. What if your future was not what you expected? What if you discover your future won't play out like you'd planned? Can you change the future or are you destined to live the life you glimpsed?    All this is pretty heady stuff to consider. Unfortunately, the philosophical debates tend to get carried out in long lectures on physics and the nature of reality and time. When Sawyer lets his characters come front and center to illustrate the philosophical problems posed by the flash forward, their issues tend to be mundane and pedestrian. When one character see himself married to someone other than his fiance two decades hence, he questions whether he should go through with marrying his fiance if the marriage is destined to fail. Another character discovers he is to be murdered in the future and sets out on a quest to find his killer. The brother of another character commits suicide when he discovers he won't become the writer he dreamed of being. (That last example is credited with changing a character's mind about the future being immutable ... despite a couple of similar instances mentioned earlier in the book that have no effect on the character's belief in a fixed future.) All these examples should be dramatic, but Sawyer seems to use them only to advance the plot to the next lesson on time and destiny and Pauli exclusions and Schroedinger's cat.    And don't even get me started on the last part of the book that takes off in an entirely different direction that will leave many readers scratching their heads and muttering \\"huh?\\".    Don't get me wrong. I do enjoy Sawyer's books. Flash Forward just isn't one I'd move to the top of the pile.
6305558167|5.0|I really get into spot-on \\"Excalibur\\" intensely. This singular version of The Matter of Britannia is very \\"two-sided\\" in a well-and-good way. In many areas, this production is both Dark and Fair, for a great redoubled richness. The settings are both Dark and Fair -- with lots of grey, brown, blood and black shades and shadows balanced by shining and sparkling flashes of chrystaline colors.  The interior Castle scenery has shadowy areas mottled with blazing fiery areas. Dark walls and halls are lit-up with fantastic tapestries and shiny silver and golden decor. Hazy dusty smoky dark-lit areas are broken-up via beams of sunshine peeking inward from lofty openings and side portals. Dark gritty grimmy fortification stonework alternates with shiny silvery marble-like finishings. The Knights and Men-at-Arms have dark grey armor and weaponry at times and blindingly shiny silvery gear at other times. They wander thru shadowy wooded leafy trees mottled with golden patches and rays of sunshine. The weather and water is at various times dark and stormy or calm and sunny.  Human actions and passions alter dark and fair. Dark grimness is moderated by humor. Much of this is intended as symbolic with scene-sets matching mind-sets -- for a very vivid cross-enforcement of ongoing themes. \\"Excalibur\\" follows the traditional Le Morte D'Arthur well -- as well as creatively. I especially appreciated the Sword-and-Sorcery -- via realistic bloody grim combat and dark magic as well as flourishes of swordplay and wonderful usage of sparkling glowing emerald green romantic spotlit accents thruout the whole movie +++
8170262259|1.0|At first, I really liked this book. I didn't care about the cheap materials used to make it, because I only paid about [...] bucks for it. Then at about page 92 or so, it all of a sudden skipped back to page 33!! I was missing about 32 pages of material that had been replaced with material from earlier in the book! I was so pissed I could scream! I want to get a legit copy of this, because mine was so worthless I threw it into the garbage. Just to let you know, this is the only book with which I have ever had this problem.
0385341008|5.0|This book is an absolute charmer! I had heard a lot of hype about this book and was nervous to read it, for fear it would disappoint. It did not. In fact, it far exceeded the hype....something that's pretty rare, in my opinion. Not only is it well-written, touching and humorous, I also learned about a pocket of history of which I was relatively unaware-- the Nazi occupation of the Channel Islands during WWII. I highly recommend this book to all, and I think it's especially well-suited for book groups. In addition, this is a great cross-generational book.

B001V9LRTM|5.0|In the mid 80's I had the opportunity to see the original movie in the theaters, bought the VHS version later and the DVD version in the 90's.    The DVD version did not include some of the shows that the VHS covered and that was a shame.    This edition not only fixes this, but adds a lot of great footage, including a more complete version of the \\"WHO\\" performance, same for Hendrix (the DVD version had only star spangled banner and the villanova junction improvisation) and many others.    Janis Joplin, Mountain, Joe Cocker and Santana performances included in this edition are amazing and the restoration that was done on the video and audio is really great (the extra disc has a nice story about the fight to get the original tapes)    The additional items in the box are also cool and despite the fact that I had to pay a lot of taxes to bring that to Brazil (for some reason the taxes are calculated here including the freight.. go figure), it is worthed every penny!

B00023BLXK|2.0|I liked the first Dirty Dancing movie, so when my husband raved about this one, I bought it instead of renting it first. It was a disappointment across the board, with just a couple of bright spots. The interaction between the girl and her father was touching. The acting by the two young stars was in character, but the script was not up to par and the rest of the actors were handicapped by the lines and situations they were required to deliver. It was shocking to see Patrick Swayze looking so old in this film. It didn't do him or the film justice. He would have been better off in a serious role rather than the bit player he was here.    The scriptwriter tried to do too many things in this film and as a consequence, accomplished none of them. The acting, the dancing, and the overall production were disappointing, to say the least. None of it was credible. I cannot understand anyone getting excited by this film, but that's just me and my tastes. The first \\"Dirty Dancing\\" film drew me in and caused me to care about the characters and what happened to them. I kept waiting for this to happen with this film, but it just never got there.

B001ER4CNY|4.0|Be aware that this contains the COLORIZED version of the first season. The colorization is done excellently, but to purists it is unwanted. In all honesty, I forgot that the 1st season was in B&W and failed to check that when ordering; I would have preferred the B&W first season. On the other hand, if ever a series originally filmed in B&W deserved colorizing, this is probably it.     OK, as for an actual review... the title pretty much sums it up.    I loved this series growing up, and I'm happy to have it in my collection.    The transfers for the first season, anyway (all I've had time to watch), are excellent and look great on my 52\\" LCD using my up-sampling DVD player.    The packaging at first glance is impressive, cute, and in keeping with the tone of the series. In that regard, it's excellent. As a practical way to safely store the DVDs, it leaves much to be desired. The packaging consists of a cardboard \\"genie bottle\\", which is rectangular in cross-section. The DVDs are in a plastic keeper device which is just basically sleeves hinge-joined along one edge (which allows the disks themselves to slip right out) which sits inside the \\"bottle\\" base. The sides of the bottle are completely open, and the set of disks can -- and do -- fall right out. You can't actually carry the disks inside the bottle, the bottle is entirely for show. The first thing I did upon opening the package and pulling the bottle out was to have the pack of disks fall to the floor. The first time I went to take the bottle off the shelf, even forewarned, I dumped the disks again and caught them on their way down. Thankfully, no damage was done either time. It would have been way better, I think, if the disks were in a closable box and/or if there was a way to keep them from just sliding out of the bottle-box so easily.
B001F290E4|4.0|To my ears, Seal is one of the finest soul vocalists on Earth. So after the robotic and only slightly engaging [[ASIN:B000TUXL34 System]], he follows up with an album that would seem to suit his immense gifts. \\"Soul\\" dips into the golden soul songbook and emerges with a thoroughly enjoyable, if not challenging, album.<br /><br />To make sure everything was immaculate, Seal hauled in super-producer David Foster. Foster has spit and polished everyone from [[ASIN:B0006JML9S latter day Chicago]] to the pipes of [[ASIN:B001F9FHIA Celine Dion.]] His wide-screen production makes everything shimmery smooth, with horns, strings and back-ups providing movie-soundtrack worthy bigness. Seal's gruff but velvety voice tackles the twelve songs here with gusto. Make no bones about it; \\"Soul\\" is a gold plated crowd pleaser, and really does sound like a labor of love for Seal.<br /><br />My slight disappointment is that \\"Soul's\\" song selection is comprised of songs you'd likely hear two or three times a day on your local All Golden Oldies radio station. While Seal does pull a couple surprises out of the bag (Ann Peeble's \\"I Can't Stand The Rain\\" and Denice William's \\"Free\\"), he could have easily dug deeper than the done to death \\"Here I Am Come and Take Me\\" or \\"If You Don't Know Me By Now.\\" Even with the safest material here, Seal's \\"Soul\\" makes for a pleasant interlude. My hope is that, having seen this album ride the charts for over a year, Seal will first make a new album of originals that suits his skills, and then make \\"Soul II\\" with a set list that dips into a deeper well.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|I haven't even received my box set yet but I am excited! As a musician I know sound. I have some of the older Beatles Cd's and they sound horrible. I can't even listen to Sgt. Pepper. Anything would be an improvement over those releases. People need to quit taking this all so serious, sit back and enjoy the music and artwork. And most of all, quit crying!
B000KC8O3S|5.0|If I were able to give this sound track ten stars, but god's I'd do it! Listening to these tracks was like watching the series again for the first time. It is absolutely amazing how music can so capture the emotional essence of a thing, and with every new listen I am again taken back to a favorite episode, scene or line of dialogue.<br /><br />The genius's who work to create the music behind Doctor Who have created a whole new kind of audio iconography, and songs like \\"The Doctor's Theme,\\" \\"Doomsday\\" and \\"The Face of Boe\\" are so immediately identifiable and emotionally charged, they carry a magic all their own.<br /><br />I admit to crying when hearing \\"Rose's Theme,\\" \\"Father's Day\\" and \\"Madam de Pompadour.\\" This music holds stories, lives and heart's desires within it's absolutely stunning use of instrumentals, vocals and chorale pieces. If you are a fan -- even a little bit of a fan -- you will only treat yourself by purchasing this sound track. More over it's the only way place to find my ultimately favorite piece, \\"Doomsday\\" which carries in it everything that ever was in Rose's and the Doctor's relationship.<br /><br />This music is amazing, you deserve to have it in your collection.<br /><br />-BB-

0374530718|5.0|This book became an instant favorite. It rests somewhere in between a novel with introspective ideas and an introductory level textbook on philosophy. The novel aspects paint beautifully the world of Sophie, whatever that is exactly. Rarely am I so captivated; every moment I wonder what little trick the author will perform next. The more textbook side is a must read for anyone interested in philosophy. It gives a run through of philosophy from Socrates to present day. Even if you know a bit about philosophy, Sophie's World makes for an entertaining read. This book is my go-to gift for graduations and birthdays, in hopes that it will help those coming of age learn to think critically.
B000005IU1|4.0|This is a review of the version of the cd bundled into a \\"2 in 1\\" with \\"Fun house\\".  The sound quality is excellent.  Listening to this album bits of it would remind me of The Doors, or The Jimi Hendrix Experience, or the singing of Mick Jagger or Jim Morrison. There is a 1950's style rock'n'roll influence to this music as well.  Anyway, here are my thoughts on the songs on this album:<br /><br />The best song:<br /><br />We will fall - comes in at an epic 10:18 minutes.  Early in the piece, you hear Iggy coughing in the background, I think (perhaps this was the first band to include this case of incidental noise? Pink Floyd have done it for songs like \\"Wish you were here).  Musically, it's an eerie track, with what might be described as 'black' buddhist chanting, if that makes sense (well, maybe the chants sound sort of sinister, if that helps). Iggy sings in intervals, with a Jim Morrison (of The Doors) style/sound. Song has handclapping and a violin appears too.<br /><br />The next best song:<br /><br />I wanna be your dog - I'd describe this as a heavy metal kind of a song. It has an evil sounding riff to it.  A while back I bought Iggy's 2 cd anthology, and it's my impression that on that cd, this song sounded a whole lot more evil, so maybe this particular cd has had its mix altered.  Anyway, I probably heard this song first as a cover in speed metal band Slayer's covers of its punk influences. That is itself a pretty good cover, though it didn't introduce the evil sounding riff to their version. They mainly changed some lyrics to be more forward than The Stooges dared to be, perhaps. The bass guitar is noticeable in this song, and you hear what sounds like sleigh bell jingling or something, which works. A single piano note, perhaps, is also used throughout, to good effect. Not that I am a familiar with the following genres, but the labels are quite evocative and seem to be relevant to this song: stoner rock; doom metal.  I'd be happy to nominate this song as a kind of heavy metal, beating the likes of Black Sabbath to that particular punch, but I do acknowledge hearing a metal band playing this song first, from memory.<br /><br />The rest:<br /><br />No fun -  The Stooges are often described as 'proto-punk' or as an influence on the first wave of punk.  Can't say that I have really heard that to a great extent, but I would count this song as being proto-punk.  It has cool, 1950s style handclapping. The rhythm guitar and singing style also have a proto-punk feel to them. The outro has Pop and the guitar screeching. Probably first heard this song on The Sex Pistols debut, so that might explain why I'm happy to call this song 'proto-punk'.<br /><br />1969 - having 'slacker' type lyrics, it would be possible, I think, to view this as being proto-punk too. The intro features Hendrix style guitar, then moves onto 1950's style rock'n'roll and handclaps. Iggy channels The Rolling Stones' Mick Jagger in this song, for his singing style.  Lyrically, this isn't a strong effort, but if you like alt.rock, you might like this song...it has screechy guitars and they just get better, or worse, depending on you like screechy guitars.<br /><br />Real cool time - the intro to this track is mildly similar in atmosphere to \\"I wanna be your dog\\". There is some Jimi Hendrix type lead guitar. Lyrics are repetitive, but the song has a real groove to it.<br /><br />Ann - Iggy gets to channel The Doors in this song, with his Jim Morrison style singing (the song itself has a Doors sound to it too)...I'm probably thinking of Doors type tracks like \\"The crystal ship\\". A slower tempo track, it gets noisier towards the end...more a noise rock kind of sound to it.<br /><br />Not right - lyrics are a bit of a downer, has a guitar riff to it.<br /><br />Little doll - the drumming has an interesting pattern and tone to it. Intro features a very deep bass guitar.  Song has a 50's style vocal rhythm to it, but just a bit slower.<br /><br />  Overall, havingonly previously heard Stooges songs via my Pop anthology, I have to say that with this kind of music, it's better to get the studio albums instead of these kinds of anthologies.  Personally, having heard this album, I'd say that a track like \\"We will fall\\" would have been a good inclusion on Iggy's anthology.  The Amazon editor's review marks this song as the band's weakest. I like it the best, of their first two cds so far, but then again, I like The Velvet Underground, which the editor says influenced that particular track.  As for my comment that this album draws on 1950s rock'n'roll influence, I suppose I have in mind the kind of vibe in songs such as \\"Born to hand-jive\\",  featured in the Grease original motion picture soundtrack...that kind of feel.<br /><br />  Recommendations:<br /><br />I'm not personally a big fan of The Velvet Underground's second album, \\"White light/White heat\\", but it does have some alternative sounding music and lyrics on it, which you may like.  Australian punk pioneers Radio Birdman also cite The Stooges as a source...they named themselves after what I think was a misheard song lyric in a later Stooges song. They also name drop The Stooges in one of their songs. So, check out their debut album \\"Radios appear\\". I've got the re-issue, with the bonus tracks on it, but now I wish I'd gotten the original, as the re-issue has messed with the track order, and not limited themselves to merely tacking on bonus songs at the end of the cd.with this kind of music, it's better to get the studio albums instead of these kinds of anthologies.

6304698682|4.0|Every few years since the early 1970s it seems we get a year when the \\"rebirth of the western\\" is touted, because of one or two films that are seen as somehow predictive of a return to glory - either through good box-office, awards, or both. Somehow it's never quite really happened, despite \\"Dances With Wolves\\" and \\"Unforgiven\\" both being huge box-office hits and Best Picture winners in the early 90s, and neo-western \\"No Country for Old Men\\" repeating in 2007. Ah well, the western will probably never get back to where it was in the early 1970s, let alone the 1950s, but the pundits have to keep trying...<br /><br />One of the first times I remember such comments being made was in 1985, the year of Lawrence Kasdan's 'New Hollywood' western \\"Silverado\\", and Clint Eastwood's third essay in the genre as director (and first in 9 years), \\"Pale Rider\\". I remember the Kasdan pic having a slightly higher profile at the time, and it's the one I saw first - I never caught the Eastwood in the theater nor for years afterward, and I just got around to giving it a rewatch this past week. \\"Silverado\\" seems to have something of a cult following, and I always just assumed it was a bigger hit, but it turns out that the film grossed about $10 million less than \\"Pale Rider\\" and cost about $20 million more - it may not have been a flop, but it was an expensive effort at a genre that most thought dead, and I'd imagine Eastwood's film must have been seen as an exception because of it's star/director.<br /><br />A small mining community, somewhere in the west in the late 1800s. Terrorized by a wealthy landowner who wants them to leave so that he can steal their land, Hull Barrett (Michael Moriarty), his wife-to-be (of sorts) Sarah Wheeler (Carrie Snodgrass) and her teenage daughter Megan (Sydney Penny) are among those who are praying for a miracle, which comes in the shape of Preacher (Eastwood) who rides into the nearby town just as Barrett is about to get beaten to death by four of landowner Coy LaHood's (Richard Dysart) thugs. \\"Nothing like a good piece of hickory\\" he exclaims after beating the tar out of the four with an axhandle. From then it's just a quick couple of scenes before both Wheeler women are falling in love with him and he's urging the miners to stick up for themselves. It becomes pretty clear that he's no ordinary man of God, if he's one at all and that any lessons in self-reliance he can teach these people will run secondary to Clint Eastwood badassery with a pistol, which comes at the end after LaHood has hired guns led by Stockburn (awesomely cold-eyed John Russell) in cool cream-colored dusters take on Preacher in a classic showdown. \\"Shane\\", anyone?<br /><br />\\"Pale Rider\\", like most of Eastwood's films, improved somewhat for me on this second time around - but not all that much. A couple of basic problems are present from the outset - first, that Eastwood is essentially replaying not just \\"Shane\\", but both his character and the storyline of \\"High Plains Drifter\\" as well - with most of the metaphysical and allegorical/symbolic material removed or heavily muted (despite his character being called, and dressing as, a Preacher), so it has a rather generic \\"man with no name rides into community to save the little people from the bad greedy corporate villains\\" storyline without nearly as much stylistic strangeness to make it interest. He even has a back scarred with bullet holes - in the same pattern which he'll shoot into one of the bad guys at the end. And second, there are a fair number of just badly or sketchily put-together scenes, a problem I think more with the screenplay (an original by Michael Butler and Dennis Shryack) than Clint's direction - the Preacher's relationship with Carrie Snodgrass' character who apparently falls in love with him right away though it's pretty hard to tell, and the scene where Preacher and Barrett ride into the main LaHood mining camp and lay waste to it with dynamite, completely unopposed. And beyond the similar aspect to his own earlier film there are also a lot of parallels with Shane<br /><br />But on the plus side, it moves along nicely - at less than two hours it's relatively short for Eastwood - the acting is all pretty solid, with Moriarty a standout, given a nice little speech by the fire exhorting his fellow miners to stand up to LaHood - and the technical aspects are all first-rate, especially considering the under-$7 million budget (can that really be correct? seems cheap even by Clint's modest standards). I love the typical contrast in the photography between piercingly bright winter skies and the very dim, naturally-lit intereriors and there really is a sense of hardness to the life depicted here in this rugged mountainous terrain. Lennie Niehaus' music is fine, if not one of his best scores, though it has a couple of nice \\"Josey Wales\\" references at one point. And there's a spareness and simplicity to the dialogue (except for some of Moriarty's longer parts) that fits the somewhat minimal and stripped-to-essentials feel of the film as a whole.<br /><br />Still few of the westerns made in the next several years seem to have taken much from Eastwood's classical style or tight, cheap and lean filmmaking - and none of them were even remotely as successful. Not only can you not teach an old dog new tricks, you can't teach a new dog old ones, it seems.t to his own earlier film there are also a lot of parallels with Shane     But on the plus side, it moves along nicely - at less than two hours it's relatively short for Eastwood - the acting is all pretty solid, with Moriarty a standout, given a nice little speech by the fire exhorting his fellow miners to stand up to LaHood - and the technical aspects are all first-rate, especially considering the under-$7 million budget (can that really be correct? seems cheap even by Clint's modest standards).

B000QXDEDG|4.0|300 is a fantastical telling of an otherwise true and historical event, that event being the Battle of Thermopylae. This movie has simply stunning visuals and excellent choreography. Its worth seeing for those reasons alone.  Its fantasy aspects aside, this movie has a surprising amount of historical accuracy. An enjoyable action movie with a good story, incredible battle scenes, and bit of a history lesson. A truly unique film.

Taking the concepts from this book into my job has been very useful.  It provokes thought and is very entertaining.

0783225725|5.0|I've been a huge Clint Eastwood fan and have recently been revisiting some of the films that I hadn't seen for years, and there's no better place to start than with this, his second film and first western as director.<br /><br />The plot couldn't be simpler, in many ways harking back to A \\"Fistful of Dollars\\" in its elegant, stripped storyline: A stranger (Clint) rides into the town of Lago, quickly getting into a shootout that he didn't start and besting the three gunfighters that the town had hired to protect them. The townspeople are afraid of another trio who had once been on the payroll also, doing time in prison for a crime committed a year before that the town is complicit in, and due back to wreak vengeance. Seeing as how their protectors are dead, they agree to hire the stranger at any cost, and he proceeds to wreak havok on the town in more ways than one before proceeding on his way after filling his bargain in apocalyptic fashion.<br /><br />If the plot's simple, the characters, style and symbolism of the piece are a little less so. The Stranger it seems is haunted by dreams - memories or visions, who can say for sure? of a man who seems to be him, the town's former marshall, whipped to death by those same three men riding back for their own vengeance. \\"Lago\\" means \\"lake\\" and the town sits on an unnamed body of water; the town seems brand-new, most of the buildings are still under construction and unpainted, though from what we learn it's been around for over a year; the townspeople are greedy and cowardly, and The Stranger is cold, merciless, in the end even demonic. Is he a figure of vengeance, a revenant or demon sent from the real Hell that he names the town after, and that the marshall is seen in one flashback as damning it to, as he orders it painted completely red before the killers arrive in town?<br /><br />Though nearly everybody in the town is unpleasant, a couple of more positive images do stand out - Verna Bloom in one of the two significant female roles is the hotel-keeper's wife, who seems at first to despise The Stranger but seemingly just because he's another brutal [...] - when she realizes that he's the only man in the town with guts she softens, and he beds her just before the showdown. A dwarf, Mordecai (Billy Curtis), is also treated more softly, with The Stranger proclaiming him sherriff and mayor, pumping him up to the point where he alone of all the townsmen shows any guts at the eventual gun battle. I suppose it could be said that Clint's vengeful figure is capable of some charity and feeling towards the only two positive and \\"good\\" characters in the film. Significantly enough the other female character, a single woman (perhaps a whore? it's never very clear) named Callie (Marianna Hill) who he rapes shortly after entering town, develops an ambiguous love-hate attitude towards him and it's left quite ambiguous as to how much has to do with the rape (which both The Stranger and other townspeople deny) or because he then ignores her for the most part, even after she betrays him at one point.<br /><br />A town that seemed promising and new, fresh and full of vitality at the beginning of the film, perched on a cool lake and apparently prosperous, at the end has been half-burnt and decimated through a supernatural wrath, a vengeance for the greed and cowardice that killed a marshall and cowers before his redeemer - this is old-Testament filmmaking of a pure kind that Eastwood never really returned to in such an obvious way. There are certainly obvious odes to his spaghetti years, in the dirt and violence and unpleasantness of the townspeople and their souls, in Dee Barton's wonderfully eclectic, eerie score and of course in Eastwood's character; I also think it shares some kinship with the Don Siegel-directed Civil War film The Beguiled from 1971, another film with more than a touch of the supernatural, and few redeeming characters. But Clint makes it his own through the economy and his refusalto make things any more flashy or outr&eacute; than the screenplay calls for (which is plenty). The cast is terrific, mostly made up of names that were second-tier at best at the time and are largely forgotten now. Bloom and Curtis are especially good<br /><br />Perhaps not one of the very best 70s westerns, and I'd certainly still put it behind \\"The Outlaw Josey Wales\\" and \\"Unforgiven\\" in Eastwood's western-ography, but it's definitely one of the weirder and more fascinating examples of the genre from America during the period.y or outré than the screenplay calls for (which is plenty).

B001NEK2GE|2.0|Ok...i was hopeing to replace my Belkin N52TE with this Beast but have  seen that all the GLITZ! (LCD screen and various colors) and Glamour (Sexy Style) is over shadowed by the actual comfort and simplicity i look for in a Gamepad!    Comfort is not all that great...i feel the Thumb stick feels a little farther than it really needs to be (almost as if u need to bend your thumb in some weird way...maybe im a weirdo like my buddies say though)  and i wished that they had put some form of riser (like the f and j keys on your keyboard) on your wasd keys, instead of an index finger type indention so u could navigate a little better as to where you are on the  gamepad keys.    I found that not being able to remove the hat (Thumb stick for my wasd keys) made me move in a diagonal direction far to easily...making me hit wall's instead of running through doorways (ouch).     So...for me it was a total miss...and now i got to pay for the return postage, =( sigh... but i trully have come to appreciate my N52 TE a heck of alot more due to the testing i have done with the G13. May not be as nice...but sure gets me in the top 3, on CofD 4... Hear of BuletCoLkToR ?
0800141660|5.0|Jane Austin's classic comes to life as an excellent cast portrays the story of Sense and Sensibility.  This story has so much more depth than most romances.  I laughed and cried through the whole film.  All of the acting was superb and the story had all the emotion, intrigue, humor, sorrow, and joy that I could hope for from a film!
B001OQCV2Y|2.0|The latest film written/directed by QuentinTarantino, the surrealistic phantasmagoria Inglorious Basterds was a big disappointment for me. I found it irritating, boring, and full of Tarantino who did not make a movie about WWII but about himself of course, about his love for movies, this time for spaghetti westerns and his interest in the German movies of the Third Reich period. All his movies are about himself and often it works. I absolutely love Pulp Fiction and believe it is his glorious achievement. I like a lot Reservoir Dogs, Jackie Brown and both volumes of Kill Bill. I said more than once that Tarantino does not make profound statements or ask eternal questions, but what he does do is entertain, and he does it marvelously - with style, class, irony, wit, and talent. Deathproof was the first alarming signal that more than anything Tarantino loves to talk and talk he does to the point that the viewer gets bored and frustrated even while watching supposedly fast and violent movie. It only got worse in Inglorious Basterds. Something is terribly missing in QT's vision of the important and tragic period of European and World history. Oh, his movie looks splendid, art direction is the best ever in any QT's films. The soundtrack is killer as always, and I'll make sure to have it. The first Chapter of the film is perfection. Pure and simple, the masterwork of setting, writing and acting. If anything, the opening introduces Christoph Waltz and Denis Menochet in the star making roles. But you know what? I am really surprised that Waltz's work has been proclaimed something of revelation by the critics while Malcolm McDowell who played the same type with relish in The Passage (1979) had been but crucified by the critics. Back to Basterds, it all goes rapidly downhill after the opening scene. It seems to me that Tarantino was under the spell of his own self-importance. He could not force himself to make some or should I say many scenes shorter. Some scenes only exist because Tarantino had to make the participants speak out his witty remarks and be the part of the snappy dialogs, his trade mark, even if and when the scenes did not make any sense and just went on and on. I think that in his last movie, Tarantino lost the sense of rhythm, and the film stuck more than once. I won't say that Inglorious Basterds is a total failure but it is so pointless, self-adoring, and often empty that sadly the brilliance can't always shine through inglorious, arrogant and pompous emptiness, and yes, stupidity. I don't think the movie problem was total lack of historical accuracy. It is not the first time, the film makers or the writers take liberty with history to create their own interpretation and vision of the epoch and the events that influenced it. One of my favorite writers since my young days, French Alexander Dumas, who is famous for highly successful historical-adventure novels, had said about his works, \\"Sometimes I have to lift up the skirts of history to make Her good sons\\". The father of The Three Musketeers (1844) and The Count of Monte Cristo could be justly proud of his creations. The result of Tarantino's violation of history has produced just that, inglorious basterds.<br /><br />My rating is 2.5-3/5 - for art direction, soundtrack, Chapter one, and introduction of Christoph Waltz, M&eacute;lanie Laurent, and Denis Menochet. Another point goes for using different languages throughout the film.ause Tarantino had to make the participants speak out his witty remarks and be the part of the snappy dialogs, his trade mark, even if and when the scenes did not make any sense and just went on and on.

B001V9LRV0|5.0|Was serving in Europe during this event with the US Military.  Would have loved to have been present for it but this is the next best thing.  Thanks to all involved in this production.
B000V4UFZK|5.0|**** PLEASE NOTE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW, IF YOU'VE NOT SEEN THE FILM YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO READ MY REVIEW FIRST ****<br /><br />So this is one of those films that I \\"should\\" have seen a long time ago; it came out in the early summer of 1982, when I was 16, between my junior and senior years of high school. I didn't yet have my driver's license and lived 10 miles from the nearest theater, out in the country, so had to rely on mom or friends with licenses (of which I had none) to get to movies - and I had a minimal allowance and didn't work outside of the plentiful chores at home. Thus I didn't see a lot of movies, and I really had no interest in horror at that point, and didn't really know directors or writers. The fact that the guy who wrote, produced, and co-edited (uncredited) this film was the same guy behind my previous summer's favorite \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" was just something I didn't catch. And for whatever reason, I've never caught up to it in all the years since, still not being a huge horror fan and no longer being a huge Spielberg fan.<br /><br />But last night I finally did, and what was I thinking leaving this so long? This is Spielberg really hitting the core of his suburban-southwestern-America-as-the-world mythology, his nuclear family beset by strangeness and chaos from beyond, and hitting it supercharged on all cylinders. Interestingly enough the only reference to a specific place here is a quick mention of \\"I-74\\", which runs from Iowa to North Carolina - but the feel of the place to me wasn't much different than that of \\"E.T.\\" or \\"Close Encounters\\", obviously the two films with which it has the closest affinity. It's Everywhere USA I suppose - everywhere outside of the Northeast, anyway. Flyover country.<br /><br />Of course this is credited to director Tobe Hooper - the man behind \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" and \\"Lifeforce\\" among others - but it feels Spielbergian all the way through, from the pans over the tract housing, to the cutesy kids, to the visual references to buddy George Lucas' work to the playing of one of Spielberg's favorite films, \\"A Guy Named Joe\\" on TV. In fact, the film opens with a TV, as the station goes off the air after midnight (I guess that'll date the film to many) and we're left with static. The story is pretty simple - a nice, young suburban family consisting of parents Steve & Diane (Craig T. Nelson and Jobeth Williams), and kids Dana, Robbie and Carol Anne (Dominique Dunne, Oliver Robbins and Heather O'Rourke) live in a modern, bland but very comfortable large suburban home and are beset by a demonic presence which eventually snatches Carol Anne away after some less harmful fun, leaving her parents to try to get her back through use of parapsychologists and a medium/mystic. The film builds rather slowly for its first half hour, then escalates pretty quickly - which works well because you'd wonder why the family doesn't leave right away otherwise. From about a third of the way in, it's a roller-coaster ride every bit as exciting as Raiders but there's a lot more going on underneath I think.<br /><br />Steve and Diane love each other and seem to be fairly committed - this is a rare Spielberg happy family with few problems - on the outside. Sure they're a little distracted, they smoke a little too much dope maybe (this was a bit of a surprise) and they're not terribly concerned about the kids' nightmares at first - but there's nothing really wrong here that is their fault. Except that they're shallow and just don't seem to pay all that much attention to what's going on around them, don't seem to have much inner life. Spielberg and Hooper build the early part of the film quite carefully - subtle moments like Diane's comment to Steve to \\"reach back into our past, when you used to have an open mind\\" show us that this is a couple that has chosen this rather dull and conformist existence; later we start to feel that they also are going through life blindly and purposelessly. Theone scene we have with Steve on his job (he's a salesman for the very same models of homes that he lives in) he seems a little distracted, uninterested, having to dredge up how to sell the home rather than really showing enthusiasm. The house the family lives in is the setting for over 90% of the film, their sanctuary, their only world.<br /><br />But then the supernatural forces take over their lives - they have to let others in, and the \\"ghostbusters\\" (well, two of the three) show themselves to be very serious and very aware of what they might be dealing with. Beatrice Straight, as Dr. Lesh, the psychologist in charge, and Zelda Rubinstein as the psychic eventually called in to form something like an exorcism, are very clear that there are powerful forces - that they absolutely believe in but cannot truly understand - at work; that this situation calls into question our most basic beliefs - but it's never quite clear what if anything Diane and Steve believe in, other than their daily existence of working, sending the kids off to school, etc. At first I thought that the reclaiming of Carol Anne would have been a good ending for the film - but they have to actually go in and fight the monster lurking at the heart both of the house and their own shallow psyches, and though they escape physically unharmed, at the end the dream house is gone, and there is a palpable sense of defeat as the bloodied family retreats to a hotel, pushing the symbol of their solipsism, a TV, outside.<br /><br />I haven't seen enough of Tobe Hooper's work to really be able to say that this fits in any way with his directorial \\"vision\\"; it's pretty clear that Spielberg's is an equal, if not the presiding, voice here. Maybe the photography is a little less pretty, maybe it's a little more gruesome and a little less sentimental than his other work, but whether that's coming from director or writer/producer I'm not sure I care - this is the most clear-eyed and pessimistic of Spielberg's early films, still plenty full of the gosh-wow (the FX look pretty good for a film of this period and the scares are still there) but on the whole a pretty harsh indictment of the shallowness of the suburban fantasy-life and of the denial and repression of history - as we find out, to no one's surprise, that the development our heroic family has been living in is an old burial ground, never de-consecrated, never forgotten, at least by the dead. They don't, in the end, manage to bring anybody over to the \\"other side\\" - but they do cause enough trauma to prevent any typical Spielbergian happy ending from glossing over.<br /><br />Pretty much tied with \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\" for my favorite film with Spielberg's name on it.on his job (he's a salesman for the very same models of homes that he lives in) he seems a little distracted, uninterested, having to dredge up how to sell the home rather than really showing enthusiasm.

B000PTYPAC|5.0|I love every song on this CD! Usually on CDs there are at least one or two songs that I always skip over, but not on this one! I first learned of Paramore from the Twilight soundtrack and then I saw them as they opened for No Doubt this summer; they are even more amazing in person!! I can't wait for their new CD to be released in a week or so!!
B0002EXH5O|5.0|Yes, its even better than Reign in Blood and Master of Puppets! Brilliant from beginning to end.
B002BSHWUU|3.0|I bought the stereo versions.  Versus the previous version I was hoping they would correct the injustices to Rubber Soul, but they did not.  However, there are some things that are better with this release, and some that will have to wait for remixes.  I own most of the previous CD catalog, and I think the mono versions of most of the early albums are better in the 1987 mixes when compared to the stereo mixes that have been remastered in this collection.    What's better: Hard Day's Night, Beatles for Sale, Revolver, White Album and Abbey Road.  In my mind these are clearly better than the previous cds.    What's about the same: the rest.    What's Worse: None.  All are better in some respect.    Overall a great job was done and the highs/Lows are more distinct.  However some of the stereo mixes seem to push vocals out of one speaker and everything else out of the other--this is a carry-forward of the original treatment of the stereo versions of the recordings.  This treatment becomes annoying particularly when listening to Rubber Soul, which contains some great songs, and is one of the greatest albums of their career.  Also, it seems that the vocals have lost some punch--not sure if this was due to any noise reduction.    To truly update these, they should be remixed, soon, while the remaining Beatles and George Martin are still alive.  There should be faithfulness to the artists original intent.  I bet some of these would be stunning properly remixed.
B000UBMWG4|3.0|This is yet another Cult Movie, but not a great one. It was alright but somewhat boring. The movie looked very good though. Was impressed by the visual effects from such an old movie. But other than that, the movie lacked. Wasn't up to par with the ratings that act like \\"You HAVE to have this movie!\\" Was a sweet price for 5 discs. Would I buy it again? Yes I absolutely would.
6305971935|4.0|For what it's worth, this is a great movie. Special effects at the time werent exactly Transformers quality nor was the director a Micheal Bay....but if you can look beyond the rotoscoped hand illumination and the cut layout in the worm hole scenes, make popcorn and grab a soda, your in for a treat.<br />Story is good as well as the acting although none of the actors are mainstream (or still around). Based on \\"actual events\\", the Philadelphia Experiment takes you through the events that happened while the battle ship was \\"invisible\\" on that fateful day in 1943.<br />The project was designed to cloak objects and make them undetectable to radar but intead, opened a wormhole to the future knocking off the main characters in the process, sending them to 80's.<br />The only thing I would have like to see to improve the movie, other than having it set anytime but the horrible 80's, is to make it closer to the story of what \\"actually happened\\". Although the government will not and probably never will admit to the experiment, the story and couriosity stands true. The thought of time travel or opening a wormhole is fascinating to all of us dorks and geeks out there, whether its true or absolute make believe.<br />Either way, its just a movie. Don't go in expecting it to change your life or anything but don't miss out on a great movie none the less.<br />P.S. If you catch the right ones, REDBOX has this movie for a dollar! You can't beat that!
B00192IV0O|4.0|Hi Guys,    Wow I have to strongly disagree with the bad ratings for this album.  The BEP are original, if nothing else.  It has appealed to me as a person in my forties and my young teen.  It is really nice to like and listen to the same music, especially in the car, and then talk about it.  I found the music refreshing and enlightening.  I am hoping to hear \\"Alive\\" and \\"Missing You\\" on the charts soon!!!!  I love this album.  As a parent, I am taking off one star for the swearing in some of the music, but hey 4 out of 5 isn't bad.
1591841992|4.0|Great book for anyone dealing in visual design or presentations of ideas.    I really enjoyed the first part of the book, but toward the end I felt like he was rambling on and not really defining the techniques.    Definitely a good read.
0061537969|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read!! Made me laugh, made me cry. I had to put the book down a few times because my eyes got \\"misted\\".  This book will touch your emotions......  I also learned a little about the fine art of racing, lot's of tips to be had.  I have heard that this book will be a movie, that should be interesting. Can't wait!
B000007ODM|5.0|Absolutely love it.... I bought it used and no scratches nor nothing, perfect conditions, it arrived before I excpected...
B002ECEFR6|5.0|I had the book, as explained, in my hands a few days before I was even expecting it
B0012CCNUU|5.0|Something like the Traveling Wilburys does not happen very often. Great individual artists getting together to have some fun and, as a result, we have something fun to listen to. Well worth adding to your collection.
0307269981|5.0|I read Larsson's first book and loved it, but I agree with others that his second novel is even better than the first.  The main character, Lisbeth Salander, is a fascinating woman with almost super-human talents.  Larsson's writing skill is phenomenal; he somehow manages to convince the reader that Salander's outlandish feats are believable, and has us cheering her on from beginning to end.  I highly recommend \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" and \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" to anyone who loves a thrilling read.
0316017922|5.0|Typical of Malcolm Gladwell to, like looking through a kaleidoscope, give you a totally different view of a subject that had become seemingly all too familiar. The secrets of success had been attributed to success, vision, strategy and a number of other things. Not that he disputes these, but in giving a different view, he explores the environment in which successful people grow up; the events that influenced their time, opportunities they had to have had, the circumstances that presented themselves and the discipline or interest or passion they had to have had to take advantage of those circumstances.    This was an interesting book; the last of the Gladwell Trilogy. I'm sure this is not the last book coming out of this unusual mind. Definitely a good read.
0156030209|5.0|Despite the fact that, or maybe because, this book is different from the norm, it is very interesting. I read it in preparation of teaching this book. I found so much interesting that can be discussed.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|I had heard of this title, but never read it, until my son who was a sophomore in H.S. had to read this book as a classroom assignment.  BTW, my son HATES reading!  He loved it and kept telling me about this book that he was totally engrossed in..(Surprise!) I quickly purchased my own copy read it and sent it to my Mom who loved it as well and made us both cry!
B001HC7XCS|1.0|The movie is in KOREAN, I sent it back, and paid $5 in shipping to return it, and never recieved a refund!!!
B001TK3XO0|5.0|I could hardly put it down and would definitely recommend it.    My daughter had to read it for an assignment and then when she was finished, I started it for lack of anything better to read.  It is a little painful to read at times because your heart hurts for some of the characters, but it really gives an insight to what people on the other side of the world are thinking, feeling, and how they live.
0061231401|5.0|I like a novel that has some historical facts (which this does) and taking the facts and bringing them into modern times by putting some conjecture & imagination into them.  James Rollins does a great job of doing that in this book and the others he has written.  He has a way of holding your attention that makes you keep reading until you are finished.  The characters are a few of the same from the past Sigma Force books.  Excellent read for vacation or rainy weekend!
B002E2QHBS|5.0|This set is very good, especially if you are into the music of that era.  I was slightly disappointed when it arrived and I realized that I did not read the product information....I thought it was a DVD set and not just CD....But it was my error and I really love the set.
0307350444|4.0|THE VOCABULARY CAN BE A BIT OBSCURE, BUT IT IS ANOTHER GREAT WORK BY MARQUEZ.
0307269981|5.0|I have never encountered another character as multi-layered and brilliant as Lisbeth Salander.  I first met her in Larsson's previous novel, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.  She was a flat-chested, waif-like teen who was a gifted computer and mathematical genius.  In this novel, she is a more overt genius but she now has breasts, which she paid for with funds from an ambiguous, illicit source. She is accused of three murders and the investigation promises to keep the reader on the edge.<br /><br />Larsson's novel captures the essence of social problems in Sweden, this one centering around the sex trade. Portrayed by extreme characters, we encounter the absolute misery and decadent behavior toward females.  Mikael Blomkvist, the good guy from the first novel, has uncovered information on the subject and plans to disclose the subject in an issue of his own magazine, Millennium.  Lisbeth becomes the savior of abused women.  She is also an extremist, many of the characters are ensconced in fanatical escapades.<br /><br />Blomkvist and Salander had a previous sexual relationship which forced Lisbeth to bury any romantic feelings and so she refuses to allow Blomkvist to contact her.  Based on her past, Lisbeth is comfortable leading a paripatetic life, with no solid relationships.  She trusts no one.  One of most vile characters is her guardian, Bjurman, who made a horrendous mistake when he sexually took advantage of Lisbeth.  Her revenge is harsh and connects the story. His attempts at revenge are proof that she is very, very smart.<br /><br />I understand that this book is the second of the trilogy and the last book may provide some closure, but I believe that Larsson keeps the reader dangling with many unanswered questions.  Larsson was too critical of the society he describes to have it tie up in a neat little package.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|This is one of the funniest, most entertaining, character-rich novels I have read in years. I love this book. It is one of those books you know while reading it, you will read again someday.<br /><br />The novel is written in the form of short letters and telegrams that paint a beautiful picture during an ugly time in World History. You will like the characters, especially the central character, Juliet Ashton, who is hilarious. Also, a couple of the key members of the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society are fascinating characters, interesting and funny, the kind you think about and miss days after you finish the book.<br /><br />You will not regret buying [[ASIN:0385341008 The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society (Random House Reader's Circle)]], and your friends will thank you for sharing it with them after you read it.  And btw, thank you Steve Buckner for convincing me to read it.<br /><br />If I had to use just one word to describe this book, the word would be: DELIGHTFUL. Buy or borrow it as soon as you finish what you are currently reading.
0786838655|5.0|Excellent Transaction.  Book arrived quickly and was in perfect shape.  Would do business with this seller again!!
B000UBMZ4S|5.0|This is a classic film that will stand the test of time for the first time viewer as well as the fans, I have seen this film at least 10 times, and still love it. Rutger Hauer does a brilliant performance as killer replicant that has heart and soul. If you love this film you should own it. So often the manufactures of these films stop making them for some reason. Best to be safe then sorry.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|If you are a True Blood fan, then this purchase is a must!! Every time I watch one of the videos, I still catch little things here and there that I missed before!!    Great collectors item, and perfect in every way!!!
B0015OKWL2|4.0|Before I saw this thriller, I kept hearing many mixed reviews about it. From James Berardinelli to [...], most found it very average. I finally got a chance to watch this Righteous Kill, but with very moderate expectations. After the film was over, I found myself liking it. Not loving it, but liking it. It wasn't great, but it wasn't terrible, either. It was . . . between average and above average.<br /><br />I think I'll start with the bad. I'm not a fan of Curtis Jackson (50 Cent), so I knew right away that his acting was wooden and dull. He doesn't even say most of his lines right; it sounds a bit like gibberish to me. Now, if Christopher Bridges (LUDA!) played Jackson's part, then it would have been far more engaging. Also, throughout the film, there are numerous cliches that we've all seen before (good cop bad cop, for example). If there was even a hint of originality, I would have given it a higher rating. The third flaw we have here is the plot twist. We already know that Turk (played by De Niro) is not the killer, so the major twist at the end wasn't shocking enough. Then, we have the script, which isn't really Grade A material. Some of the dialogue was pretty cheesy, and some scenes felt very uneven. And lastly, the sex scenes . . . they were very out-of-place and very unnecessary.<br /><br />Now, here's the good. First we have De Niro and Pacino. I mean, DE NIRO & PACINO! In the classic film Heat, they were only onscreen together for about ten minutes. Here, these two guys share the screen almost throughout the movie. And although, as I mentioned before, the script is pretty average, De Niro and Pacino deliver their lines very well. The supporting cast (Dennehy, Wahlberg, Gugino, and Leguizamo) do a very fine job as well. Finally, there are a bit of references to Heat that can be found here, and while they are a bit too obvious, they're mildly decent at best.<br /><br />Again, this is a thriller that's not great and not horrible. I give it a B- because, even though there were some crappy moments, it's still fun to watch Pacino and De Niro interact with each other. Jon Avnet is a good director, but he could have given a lot of things here some improvement. I hope he gets to make far more sophisticated films in the future.me crappy moments, it's still fun to watch Pacino and De Niro interact with each other.

B00002ZMNV|5.0|Say what you will about what late bassist Cliff Burton's attitude would have been with regards to Metallica's artistic direction in the '90s, but he would have certainly approved of this experiment with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. As illustrated at one point in the entertaining 40-minute documentary included with this release, Burton was an enthusiastic fan of classical music, and the concert on these two DVDs is a great example of how the two genres -- at first seemingly opposed -- can meld instead of clash.    I'd like to take some time to review Sam Graham's review for Amazon.com, showcased above. In it, Graham cites Metallica's fan base as being predominately white and male. That's factually on-target; even the concert footage confirms this. However, there are many female fans in the audience as well, some in the front row no less -- not to mention millions of female fans, then and now, all over the world. It demeans them to imply they're nearly nonexistent. And here are certainly many fans who are not white; why race even enters into Graham's review is a mystery, as is the seeming offense at James Hetfield's calling the audience \\"man.\\" It's called a colloquialism.    As for Graham's assertion that the orchestra \\"adds texture but not much else\\" to Metallica's sound, I beg to differ there as well, but only in regards to certain songs. True, on some songs (mostly from the Load-ReLoad era), there's not much the orchestra can do -- they offer some moments where they just follow the guitars. 'Fuel' is an prime example of this. That song's inclusion is strange, since it is essentially a song about going really fast in a car, which is not something that lends itself to violins and a harp playing in the background.    Where the orchestra really shines shows when the \\"old stuff\\" is performed. One needs to only listen to the S&M version of 'Call of Ktulu' to see this executed. Far more than \\"superfluous bombast\\",'Call of Ktulu' is the perfect song for this concert. In the documentary, Hetfield mentions how members of the orchestra were surprised to see such complex song arrangements from a rock band (though he wasn't specific on the songs they meant, I doubt they said it regarding 'Devil's Dance'), and it's during these arrangements that the concert excels. The version of 'The Thing That Should Not Be' here is even better than the version found on Master of Puppets, almost to the point where you might feel like the band originally intended an orchestra for the song. It's a real shame that other classic Metallica songs like 'Fade to Black' and 'Sanitarium -- both of which would certainly be enhanced by an orchestra -- didn't make it on the setlist.    Weirdly, Graham says the show is \\"...basically just a filmed concert, with little in the way of additional visual interest.\\" What sort of additional visual interest did Graham envision? Explosions, maybe? That wouldn't be practical, given where the concert took place. Everything else was done that night to make the visual experience entertaining as well: the lighting changes follow the mood of the songs (at one point during 'For Whom the Bell Tolls', they shut off completely), there are multiple dynamic camera angles (a few humorously close to the mic), so what else could have been added? Furthermore, the DVDs allow for multi-angle views for select songs -- follow the band member of your choice.    Graham has at least one part right: the sound quality is excellent. In addition to the superb mix, the option exists for the viewer to virtually mute either Metallica or the orchestra. This addition alone makes the purchase worthwhile. If you'd like proof of the fallacy that the orchestra doesn't add much, turn off Metallica for awhile (just a little while, of course). Hear for yourself their contributions to the concert. And yes, Graham also correctly points out that most everyone filmed seems to be having a great time. It's especially entertaining to see members of an orchestra, normally an austere group, getting excited.    Basically: take Graham's review with heaps of salt. This DVD set is a necessary addition to any Metallica fan's video library, and something that can perhaps bring lovers of both metal and classical music to the same room to actually enjoy a concert at the same time. (But not for long after. Soon enough, the metal fan will want to talk about Ride the Lightning and the classical fan will want to chat about Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture, and the two will probably part ways.)
B001FB4W0W|5.0|This is a fantastic series!! I read all the Sookie books back in the spring and decided to give the show a try. It seems most books that are made into movies or TV shows end up horribly. Not True Blood!!!! It kind of follows the first book but it has some very interesting sub-plots that add to the whole story instead of taking away. If you liked the book series you will definitely like the show! I think I did drive my husband a little crazy with all my \\"that didn't happen in the book- but that's a great plot turn\\". I look forward to Season 2 coming out on DVD- It's been hard trying to keep all my friends from telling me what happens- but it will be worth it!!!!! Enjoy!

I am also not a fan of downloads since you are simply stuck at that bit rate.  320kbps is the maximum amount mp3 permits, but in the future who knows how that will sound compared to better compression formats that will undoubtedly emerge.  The sound quality is great, and its even better when you have a high quality sound system.

This book does not disappoint!  Published posthumously, it contains her exacting drawings, measurements and pattern details that provide a wealth of information about the \\"undergarments\\" and accessories worn during the latter half of the 16th century to the mid-17th century.  This is required reading for anyone involved with theatre/film costume; and sets a high standard for anyone conducting research in material culture and historic costume design; as well as those who construct garments, as it contains \\"how to\\" instructions, tools, and resources.  It also has the added benefit of color reproductions of period paintings and photographs of extant garments that have not been previously published.

Full of the usual twists and turns, Gone Tomorrow is fast-paced .... on the par with his other novels, full of intelligent and interesting plot development and characters who come to life almost immediately.  I started reading this novel out loud to my husband on a long car trip. When we got home, we fought over who would ultimately take this one to bed to finish it. I won. Reacher's my favorite unlikely hero; Lee Child is a master----just wish he was more prolific.

0757302661|3.0|I thought that this book would tell me the specific techniques of the HypnoBirthing process, but it really only vaguely describes them. You have to take the classes to really benefit from the techniques... I didn't have the money or free time to go. However, I found the theories of the book to be very enlightening and helpful. I gave birth to my second child using HypnoBirthing and was extremely satisfied with my experience. While I did absolutely experience pain, I felt in control and calm and ready. The pain was compeltely manageable and productive - and I attribute that to the relaxed frame of mind this book helped me to achieve. An interesting read, and a good advocate of completely natural births. If the want the specifics though, skip the book and take the classes. (They give you one there)

0312370849|4.0|My cousin was born in Paris in January, 1942 to Jewish parents.  For reasons left vague by is parents, I learned that he had spent the war years in the countryside outside Paris living with a Christian family.  \\"Sarah's Key\\" clarifies precisely why my cousin was hidden, for Sarah's key unlocks a shameful chapter in France's history that demonstrates clearly the level of its complicity with the Nazis.  On July 16, 1942, the police rounded up thousands of Jewish families, housed them in a stadium called the Veleodrome d'Hiver and eventually transported them to the death camps. The fictional character named Sarah escapes from this stadium,and her story illuminates this moment in history in a way that history books cannot.    The novel begins by juxtaposing short (2-5 page) chapters of Sarah's story, told in the third person, with the first person, present day narrative of a journalist who learns of the events of July, 1942, the story of Sarah and eventually how the lives of her husband's family intersected with the life of Sarah.      Sarah's story is the strength of the novel.  It is a powerful and heartbreaking. I found this narrative so compelling that the journalist's narrative became annoying and then intrusive.  Once Sarah's story is fully told, the novel continues only in the journalist's voice.  Her attempt to find out what happened to Sarah after the war and her husband's family involvement was interesting but paled in comparison to Sarah's story.     That said, I couldn't put the book down and finished it in one day.  My wife did the same.  The journalist's story may have been soap operaish and predictable in parts, but overall this is a very well written page turner that also makes an important contribution to the literature of the holocaust.

B0025KVLRY|4.0|Review for the 2009 remasters, after listening for well over thirty five years, Capitol vinyl, '87 cds, I'm not in total awe over the newly restored albums, although the first four are available now in \\"stereophonic\\", vocals on the right side, instruments on the left. I recently purchased, Please Please Me, With The Beatles, Hard Days Night, Help, Revolver, after listening, Revolver is no doubt excellent, the harmonies and vocals are clear and vital, as are McCartney's pounding bass lines, \\"With The Beatles\\" seems to stand out overall, the most noticeable in the new remastered sound, Help, Hard Days Night, are basically the same.  I'm not sure the '87 mono version of \\"please please me\\" doesn't have the upper hand over the new version, maybe a little more kick or punch, or a \\"fuller\\" sound, Love Me Do, P.S I Love You, also still remain mono cuts on the new remastered disc...so if you already have the '87 later albums, Sgt. Pepper, Abbey Road, White Album, Let It Be, don't bother with, Yellow Submarine, \\"one of\\" the worst albums recorded in rock-n-roll history, all of these are already remastered in stereo and recently listening to my old version of the White Album it sure sounded good enough for me, the new distrubution is just a reminder don't forget the 2009 Beatles, maybe for the younger generation to give it a listen, remastering is good, let's not forget the music. Five stars for the new restored, WITH THE BEATLES, starting from the energized beginning with, \\"It Wont Be Long\\", \\"Hold Me Tight\\", \\"Roll Over Beethoven\\" and slowing down with, \\"Till There Was You\\", \\"You Really Got A Hold On Me\\", and ending the album is an energized John Lennon wailing on, \\"Money\\", their second Parlophone recording, a good start to hear the new revived Beatles.  Each new disc is packaged in a digipak with booklets of each album, the disc is placed in the side of the cardboard and can easily scratch, handle with care, the new disc are designed with the original british parlophone label.

0316017922|4.0|Outliers is about what makes the most successful people successful. Often this is explained by crediting their intelligence and ambition, or some other individual characteristic. Malcolm Gladwell has a different explanation. A persons individual effort is obviously important, but there are additional factors. Early support from parents and others is critical. All the examples he sites were given opportunities by chance or by some factor beyond their control. Success also seems to take a long time; some people worked for decades before they achieved any notable success.    Outliers is very well written as I would expect from a book by Gladwell. However it is  not as good as Gladwell's previous books which I have read. It seems more disjointed and less well organized then his other books. It definitely read more like magazine articles assembled into a book.    Outliers is not proscriptive, it provides no instructions on how to be successful. Instead it looks at a few cases of successful people and explains their achievements.

Still, I sort of apporached this one with a little hesitation just because from the cover, I though I was getting Beetlejuice meets Pipi-Longstockings. For those of us who like Burton's wry and dark humor from his own works, while not as dark here until you get deeper into the movie, still I really hafta admit I warmed to the Coraline character pretty fast.  In short, a fun-fun movie and feel-good in a gothy sort of way. I am in no way, sorry I purchased and will pull it down to watch often over time.

Iowa is my favorite album by Slipknot, and is in my top favorite five albums of all time. When I first started to listen to Slipknot back in August 2004, I started out with Vol 3 The Subliminal Verses, a neighbor of mine at the time let me borrow the album for about two weeks, and when they wanted it back I didn't want to, but I did, a few days later I bought my own copy and now I have the regular version released in 2004, and the special edition with two discs in 2005. Ever since then I have been following them closely. I also have three copies of Slipknot's self titled album. I wish Slipknot would go back into the studio, and make another Iowa which I think will never happen again. They should at lest re release Iowa in 2011 when it's been 10 years since the album was released. Iowa got me into death metal, I know Iowa isn't death metal, but this album is very intense. I hope Slipknot is around for many years to come, because I personally think they are one of the best bands in metal.

0786838655|5.0|The Lightning Thief by Rick Riordan was an exceptional book.  I would rate it a 5 out of 5. The main character, Persy, finds out that he is the son of the mythological God Poseidon and he is charged with stopping a war BEFORE it starts. It appears that most, if not all of the mythological creatures in Percey's textbook come to life. Not all the God's like Percy as he is suspected of stealing from Zeus. He has limited time to find Zeus' stolen property and bring peace. The Lightning Thief one of the most action packed books I have ever read. It is full of monsters popping out of no where and trying to kill Persey.  This book will have you jumping out of your seat with excitement.  It is a good book for both boys and girls and is one that will definitely get your blood flowing.      Review by JP Ascolese

0316113506|4.0|In \\"Spark\\" Harvard Medical School John Ratey begins with an Illinois school district where administrators have implemented a fitness program and seen startling success in student's academic records.  The administrators discovered that regular intense cardio-vascular exercise make students more alert and focused in the classroom, and able to absorb and retain information better.  That's the power and miracle of exercise, Dr. Ratey says, and completey ignores the fact that smart committed administrators with initiative and drive are going to succeed no matter what program they implement (whether it be a reading program or a meditation program or an outdoor education program).  The breathless writing in \\"Spark\\" -- exercise will relieve stress, anxiety, depression, attention deficit disorder, addiction, hormonal changes in women, and aging -- can be annoying at times, as is the overcomplicated science behind exercise's effect on the brain that can be skimmed at times and ignored at times.  But there's no doubt that John Ratey offers sage and useful advice, and that the world would indeed be a lot better if people exercised more.

But the very sad thing about The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is that it will be the only book from Mary Ann Shaffer, who died without seeing the enormous success it has enjoyed. This book incorporates history with a wonderful story about the innate goodness of people (well, most people) placed in difficult circumstances. It also portrays the cruelty and barbarity of people. An interesting juxtaposition, certainly, and it all works in this book. There's a lovely love story here too, which has endeared TGLAPPPS even more to its readers. Mary Ann Shaffer was, in a word, simply a wonderful story teller, and this book is one of a kind. - Tim Bazzett, author of LOVE, WAR & POLIO

B001NFNFNU|3.0|Changeling is the story, based upon actual events, of Christine Collins' quest to find her young son Walter, missing without a trace. It is also the story of appalling corruption in the government and police department of 1920's-'30's Los Angeles, which apparently has been a significant problem of long-standing. A third subplot involves a serial child killer who may or may not have had contact with Walter, and a forth presents a horrific view of the psychiatric ward in a local hospital.<br /><br />Angela Jolie, Jeffrey Donovan, and Michael Kelly all turn in admirable performances in spite of the need to cope with a too-lengthy  script that verges upon melodrama in many spots. Scenery, lighting, sets, and costuming all convey an authentic period feel in a film that is grimly somber from start to finish. Some scenes (a hanging and some ax murders) are graphically disturbing, though brief, and Eastwood's score is subtle and unobtrusive; as a director, he has generally relied on the story line to stimulate emotion, rather than music to  create it artificially.<br /><br />While it does bog down in places, this is a movie worth viewing, for its ability to demonstrate how easily a corrupt system can control and damage the lives of countless individuals who place their trust in it.

0679722610|4.0|I have always enjoyed mystery and crime novels, but I can't say I'm an avid fan of either genre.  I've read a fair amount of Sherlock Holmes, Edgar Allan Poe as well as some Victorian Gothic fiction.  I've read some Agatha Christie and other early/mid-20th century mystery/crime novels.  I'd paid attention in history class and had a basic idea of life in and around the Prohibition era in America and the world of gangsters and bootleggers.  And despite all of that, I wasn't entirely prepared for what to expect from Red Harvest.     The general style of the novel was intriguing from the onset.  We're dropped into a gritty first person narration from an unnamed character as he wanders the streets of `Poisonville' to meet some unknown client and then, later, to solve the murder of that client.     I really enjoyed the way the details of the story were presented.  The writing was very detailed and the narrator conveyed his thoughts and perceptions very well.  With the tight first person narration, the mystery for the characters was just as much a mystery to us.  Even simple details such as names and places seemed to come on a \\"need to know basis.\\"  Thus, there existed the mystery of the crime to be solved, as well as the mystery of what details were being withheld from the reader and why.     As the story progressed, I grew attached to the protagonist as a cynical hard-nosed detective of the sort who \\"always gets his man.\\"  When he solved the murder, I was impressed by the logic involved and by his way of seeing through the prejudices and smokescreens around the case.       The way the case was solved was quite unlike a Holmesian solution in that there weren't any telltale clues at the crime scene or analysis of fingerprints or paper fibers.  Instead, the Continental Op made a logical supposition and then through manipulative and threatening speech worked enough of a confession out of the killer to close the case.  It reminded me of the intimidation tactics seen in so many of the crime movies and TV shows today.     I expected the confession to be incorrect since so much of the novel was left unread.  Instead of letting the murder unravel, the plot took a different turn that I rather enjoyed.  The corrupt \\"head\\" of Poisonville asks the Op to clean up the town and gives him carte blanche to do so.     The resulting manipulative method of setting crook against crook was a lot of fun.  What was interesting to me, as the city grew more and more corrupt, was that our protagonist had become an antihero.  Instead of the altruistic detectives of other early crime novels, the Continental Op was secretive, manipulative, vengeful and dishonest.  He had an end goal in mind and he planned to achieve it at any cost.  While he wasn't actually running a bootlegging or gambling operation himself, he largely became as corrupt as those he hunted.  He compromised those around him who may be innocent or, at least, less corruptible.     Finally, he fell beyond the point of no return and concluded his downward spiral.  At that point, I had no idea whether or not the story would allow the Op to be redeemed or if he would simply succeed in cleaning up Poisonville and then leave it a tainted and broken operative, ready to take his cynicism to the next case.  While the Op did end the novel a bit more hardened and broken than when he started, the resolution did lighten some of his burden and return his respectability.     I definitely enjoyed my experience with this book.  Looking to the few books I've read from the Victorian era, I can see numerous stark differences.  The dialog was much harsher than that of a Sherlock Holmes story and the violence was more over the top and graphic than the Victorian Gothic novels I've read.  The mystery was tight and well organized, but the clues were extracted more through force and intimidation than through insight and deduction.     What is even more striking to me is the pacing of the novel.  While it did have vivid descriptions and various scenes of thoughtful internal monologue, the pacing was much quicker than the average 19th century mystery or adventure novel.  While the story did expose many sides of human nature, the narrative didn't pause for lengthy paragraphs reflecting on the motivations or psyches of the characters or of society as a whole.  Any explicit analysis was concise and well integrated into the peppy, fast-paced world in which the action revolved.      The book's first purpose seemed to be one of escapism and it does provide an exciting escape from a mundane life.  The heightened action and quickened pace would coincide well with the quickly expanding world of the post-war Americans watching the world zip past them.  Added to the speed is the vivid portrayal of the exciting and frightening criminal underworld which puts a human face on the stories people may hear about on the radio or speculate about as they drink their own Prohibition scotch and think about where it came from.     This book opened new storytelling elements and devices that are still being used today.  It seems to create a new realistic novel that allowed it to show the darker underbelly of the world without flinching.  It also provided a darker antihero who ends the novel only partially redeemed and yet more human and relatable.     Likely somewhat shocking at first, I suspect this sort of adventure was quickly accepted by the younger for its fast pace and \\"real\\" portrayal of the tenuous world of the 1920s.  The older generation may have found it too shocking and may even have condemned its graphic and violent content.  I can see the crime story of the 1920s as being a huge boundary pusher in terms of content and style in the same way that violent radio and then television, movies and eventually video games would continue to do over the next century.  The shock value would be titillating to the younger crowd, intriguing to the middle generation, and hateful and offensive to the older generation engrained in the classic values of days gone by.    ****  4 stars
B000K4WPCM|5.0|I had never heard of this movie until my son told me about it. He knows how much I loved Twilight so he thought I would like it. No, it's not about vampires. It's in a class of it's own. I loved this movie. I've watched in five times so far. It is great.
0374139563|1.0|I was really looking forward to finally reading a different perspective (in this case, an African woman from Zambia) in the foreign aid debate, but could NOT get past the first few pages. Dambisa Moyo may not be the best writer, but her editor needs to know that he or she did a terrible job. All the verbs are in the wrong tense, and it's hard to make out what she is trying to say because the grammar is so poor. The publisher did a true disservice to the author, whose point is lost among all the errors in the book. A total shame, and a total waste of money.
0061537969|5.0|If you've ever loved a dog, this book is for you.  I enjoyed the way Garth Stein gave Enzo both great heart and great intelligence.  Enzo's narration is natural to the story.  As Denny goes through all the grief of a family in crisis, Enzo is there to love him and push him.  Denny's daughter, Zoe, is presented with a clear eye for childhood and the pressures of trying to please all the adults, all the time.  The motif of racing, the knowledge imparted by Enzo about racing and about life, it just does not get any better than this.
B001V7R09A|5.0|At the time these recordings were made for DG Sviatoslav Richter was just emerging from his Soviet cocoon, having previously been isolated, for the most part, from western culture and influence. While Richter's art matured as he was exposed to musicians and musical ideas outside the iron curtain, his middle period, which these recordings capture, reflect an undiluted artistic personality that was highly creative, but also unorthodox if not sometimes wayward.<br /><br />Let's start with the great stuff here: poetic Bach, a gem-like Haydn sonata, mesmerizing Debussy estampes and preludes, Richter's classic recording of Rachmaninoff's second concerto and six preludes, as well as definitive recordings of Prokofiev's fifth concerto and eighth sonata. Richter's stupendous traversal of Scriabin's fifth sonata, taken from a live recital, is also here. Richter's complete grasp of this material and his technical mastery are overwhelming and it's not surprising that several of these recordings received awards including the Grand Prix du Disque, Edison and Deutscher Schall Platten Preis.<br /><br />Richter's Chopin illustrates the occasionally manic aspect of the great pianist's playing, especially the two ballades included here which both suffer from openings that are ultra-slow. While Richter was seeking something poetic, the pace is simply inconsistent with the overall architecture of these pieces. That being said, this same slow treatment works brilliantly in the opening measures of Debussy's Pagodes. Once you hear it, you'll be convinced that there is no other way to play it as Richter casts a magical spell that has never been equalled.<br /><br />The polonaise-fantasy is also somewhat inconsistent with excessive rubato which, to my way of thinking, doesn't work very well. For a stunning polonaise-fantasy one must turn to Horowitz, who truly owned this piece. Likewise, one hearing of Claudio Arrau's distinguished Abegg Variations demonstrates that not everything Richter touched turned to gold. Here Richter, as was often the case with his playing at the time, starts out very slowly and then is almost too fast, rattling off the variations like a series of technical exercises, whereas Arrau's approach, no less of a technical tour-de-force, is far more colorful and musically oriented. There are no reservations whatsoever about Richter's Chopin etudes which are impressive indeed.<br /><br />Richter's treatment of Mozart's 20th piano concerto is completely unconvincing - at this point in his career he seemed not to understand the Mozart idiom at all. The awkward-sounding cadenza he plays is unfamiliar as are some of the ornamentations. The Schumann concerto is executed very smoothly, but seems almost glib; however, the op. 12 Fantasiestucke are very lovely. In fact, the solo Schumann material from the first LP Richter made for DG in 1956, is all outstanding.<br /><br />The other concerto recordings are also, to be honest, a mixed bag. To call the Tchaikovsky concerto with Karajan sluggish would be an understatement, however, this was a result of bad chemistry between soloist and conductor. To quote the liner notes: \\"Karajan exercised a curious blend of interference and negligence which riled Richter for decades to come.\\" The Beethoven C minor concerto with Sanderling fares somewhat better, but it still lacks the conviction and authority of, for example, Fleisher/Szell or Arrau/Galliera.<br /><br />I love the fact that these cd's replicate the cover art and programs of each LP as they were originally released, so prepare yourself for a jolt when Richter launches into Rachmaninoff's massive op. 32, no 1 prelude, the first of six preludes which follow the second concerto. This is incredible Rachmaninoff -- Richter absolutely dominates each prelude in an unrivalled display of technical authority and poetry.<br /><br />While not every performance is the best that Richter ultimately had to offer, overall this is an essential collection from oneof the great pianists of the 20th century.
B001TLMYEE|4.0|Imagine you are a turkey being fed comfortably on one of those mass production turkey farms. You may well assume that the good food, good company, and pleasant surroundings will go on forever.  If you are a quant-savvy turkey, you might even gobble together a mathematical model that predicts good times well into the future, beyond not just Thanksgiving, but past Christmas and New Years as well.  Suddenly in November, unexpectedly, with life-changing consequences...things change.  You just didn't see it coming.  Pass the cranberry sauce.<br /><br />Financial planners, economists and other more sophisticated turkeys don't see it coming either, argues author Nassim Nicholas Taleb.  His book highlights the danger of the unexpected.  The unexpected will happen even if we have a comfortable model predicting only minor changes.  After such a \\"black swan\\" catches us by surprise, we use our flawed hindsight to decide how we could have predicted the disaster using a better model.  We are kidding ourselves, insists Taleb.  We need better strategies to live in a world where truly random, unpredictable events occur.  He goes to some trouble in this book, and his previous [[ASIN:1400067936 Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets]], to educate us.<br /><br />The flawed basis of many formal models is \\"the great intellectual fraud\\" of the bell curve.  We learn that highly constrained variables like height and weight cluster around an average and that extreme variations from the average are unlikely.  We just aren't going to meet anybody that's half a foot or half a mile tall.  These \\"Mediocristan\\" models are fine until we misapply their assumptions to unconstrained \\"Extremistan\\" phenomena like stock values, book sales and such.  We are slow to see this problem.  We persistently commit the \\"Ludic Fallacy,\\" clinging to our formal models because they seem more real to us than the messy, real-world events they are meant to explain.  Taleb illustrates this point with examples ranging from the events of 9/11 to the \\"off model\\" problems that cost casinos money.  S. I. Hyakawa warned us in the early `70s that \\"the map is not the territory,\\" but we haven't learned.<br /><br />Taleb also warns us of the narrative fallacy based on our love of stories.  We feel we understand something when we can tell a story about why it happened--even after the fact, with only part of the relevant information.  When musicians achieve fame and dramatic financial success, we backtrack through their histories, explaining success by what we see along the path.  We don't see the hidden cemetery of failed garage bands and starving artists who did all the same things to no avail.  Because we believe this artificial story, we don't have to face the role of randomness in success or failure.  Or consider its impact on our own plans.<br /><br />Taleb offers some suggestions--though fewer than I'd hoped for.  He advises us to be open to positive black swans and guard against negative ones.  Lending money at interest, for example, opens us only to a high impact negative.  This worst case is that the borrower will go bankrupt and we won't get our money back.  But the very best outcome is that the loan will be simply repaid.  If the borrower's entrepreneurial effort is wildly, off-the-scale successful, the lender doesn't get any more than this.  An investor, on the other hand, suffers the same risk of loss, but participates fully in an \\"Extemistan\\" success.  Readers are left to ponder the implications--and perhaps to hire Taleb as an investment consultant.<br /><br />Although Taleb does not venture there, some of his ideas are useful in applied psychology.  Personnel tests, for example, rely on the principle of \\"behavioral consistency,\\" assuming that our past actions best predict our future actions.  If someone is a poor performer, the safe bet is that this person will perform poorly in future employment.  This may be fit a general model, but employers--and psychologists who advise them--might consider whether we commit Taleb's fallacies.  Are we so comfortable with are general predictive models, with our stories about how people \\"are,\\" that we close ourselves to possible change?  Wouldn't it be better to seek the occasional \\"gray swan\\" of improvement and hire the flawed job applicant?  The author has convinced me that this is worth considering.  My time reading this book was well spent.<br /><br />One final note:  The author's condescending tone has been mentioned by other reviewers.  It's there all right.  Yes, he is condescending.  Yes, he sneers at his fellow financial analysts.  Yes, his citations veer into name dropping.  And, yes, he finds ways to not-so-subtly complement himself as he praises Benoit Mandelbrot.  But none of this matters.  Taleb's message is valuable.  I recommend you ignore his tone--or perhaps even be entertained by it. Stay on task and learn something about the nature of randomness and prediction.ight consider whether we commit Taleb's fallacies.

B001TOD92C|1.0|I have gone through a LOT, in my lifetime, for Bruce Springsteen....but sitting through this movie to get to his song at the closing credits was almost too much.  OK, it WAS too much, because I already had the song on CD.  But I still wanted to see how it fit into the context of this film.<br /><br />And...well, the only thing I felt at the start of the song was relief that the movie was over.<br /><br />I don't understand the positive critical reviews. Mickey Rourke's character was not only a Loser with a capital L, but he wasn't even interesting.<br /><br />His life was a big waste: his chosen profession is one of fakery and self-abuse, he had a drug addiction, a dead-end day job, dead-end (or just dead) relationships, a crappy trailer, no taste in music, and could not take care of his own basic health needs.<br /><br />Not much could be worse than all this, except--on top of everything!--where does he live? New Jersey.<br /><br />So the movie sets all this up, and does the audience get to see some sort of transformation, or revelation of depth, or ANYTHING that isn't more of the same sad decline?<br /><br />No.<br /><br />This movie was supposed to have been Mickey Rourke's comeback--his life apparently mirrored, to a lesser degree, his character \\"the Ram\\"--but I just don't see it. Life imitating art, or vice versa? Let's hope Rourke's next vehicle gives the actor a shot at a different ending.

B002ECN4P0|4.0|It's hard to imagine a Stones fan not being offended by the edited down versions of some of the songs here. \\"Miss You\\" comes off sounding like an advertising jingle. Add to that the incoherent song sequencing, and you have a real mess. It's also unclear why it's necessary for \\"Wild Horses\\" and \\"Brown Sugar\\" to appear on every Stones' compilation. Unfortunately, Jump Back is probably the best Stones' compilation of post-60s material. Jump Back does include all of the band's major hits during the period from 1971 through 1989. Forty Licks suffers from the same problems, besides offering a much weaker overview of their 60s music compared to Rolled Gold+ (or Hot Rocks). With thousands (well, not quite thousands) of RS compilations out on the market, they should have gotten it right by now. Unfortunately not!
B0025KVLS8|4.0|In \\"A Hard Days Night\\" cd-- the stereo remasters are perfectly engineered except for the song \\"If I Fell\\" the begining of the song is very bad...and the \\"..was in vain\\" part of the song (at 1:43--listen to Paul's voice)...sounds like he choked.  Don't throw away your old MONO \\"A Hard Days Night\\" cd...this is the only song you want to keep.
B00006EXDM|4.0|When Hot Rocks was released in 1972 on vinyl, it was the definitive Stones compilation. However, 21 songs on two CDs seems a little skimpy, and Hot Rocks leaves out a number of hits, important album tracks, and entire portions of their musical history. Rolled Gold+, released in late 2007, provides a thorough summary of the Stones 60's music, 40 songs on 2 discs, including all 21 songs from Hot Rocks and 15 songs from More Hot Rocks. I would recommend passing on this album (and More Hot Rocks) in favour of the much more satisfying Rolled Gold+.

B0015DYIH2|3.0|I really enjoyed the first three books of the twilight saga despite the overuse of some words and phrases and the use of wording.  I enjoyed the plot even though it was not the greatest writing.  I had a hard time not skipping ahead to see what would happen in previous books, however, I did not have that problem with this book.  I felt the story was drawn out more than it should be.  There was too much detailed put into certain events while not nearly enough in others.  The dialogue between the Cullens and their witnesses was lacking.  I just didn't feel that this book did justice for the story that I was so eager to complete.  It's a happy ending, but to get to that, it's just the pregnancy and then a fight with the Volturi that takes up the book.  I was really hoping to disagree with all the negative reviews on here, but I was greatly disappointed with this book.

I found the photographs, reproductions of artwork, and scale patterns taken from surviving garments to be incredibly useful in creating my own interpretations for historical re-enactment.    For making caps, coifs, drawers, shirts, smocks, ruffs or collars, for the period around 1600, this is *the* reference work.

B001GCUO1Q|3.0|I saw it recently expecting one of the worst films ever made (like X-MEN: THE LAST STAND) and I was mildly surprised. I think that surprise was due to the fact that I had EXTREMELY low expectations. It's interesting to see so many characters in this film that are part of the X-Universe in some way, from Blob to Emma Frost to Deadpool, but waaaay too much of this film is either aped completely from other films (Agent Zero's gun skills are essentially cribbed from the far superior EQUILIBRIUM, and a drug inducing a death-like state of a loved one? Read any Shakespeare lately?) or the film has plot holes the size of The Milky Way. Seriously... an Adamantium bullet? THAT'S how you can explain something like the ending of this film? Ugh. The biggest mistake that director Gavin Hood and the writing team made was not really keeping with James Howlett's actual origin, which would have been a film in and of itself if they had adapted the graphic novel ORIGIN, but they decided to do a REALLY short adaptation of it: The opening five minutes. And then they went berserk with mutant mayhem. And the mayhem isn't so much the action or the story; it turned into a game: How many obscure mutants can we fit into one film?<br /><br />The other game that it turned into was how can we create a spinoff for Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool? Like that's a character that needs its own film, especially after what they did to him in this film.<br /><br />There are cool moments in the film, and moments that made me smile, and Hugh Jackman is very cool as Logan. So, again... not so bad that it made me want to punch everyone involved, like THE LAST STAND did, but not so good as to rank amongst the really-good-ness of the first film or the sheer genius of X-MEN UNITED. 3 out of 5 is a decent score if you expect NOTHING from this film other than some cool action and Jackman's wife-beater posturing.
B000MRAAJM|3.0|This film certainly had its moments and was extremely beautiful in 1080p high definition. I consider this a good demo for Blu Ray DVD technology. However, aside from the scenes of obvious and extreme beauty, there were scene after scene of predators killing helpless prey. I just didn't enjoy that material and I would not permit my grandchild to watch it. Then, once the killing sprees were over I found myself literally watching the grass (lands) growing in time lapse photography.<br /><br />This film contained scene after scene of animal violence (edited, granted) and then placid scenes of watching the grass grow. I don't think this movie is what everyone cracks it up to be and I think they are being overly impressed by the ultra-clear picture, not the content. Anyhow, that's my opinion. I laid down my $60 dollars based on input from friends who I just don't agree with about this series. I guess I expected something else.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I'm not someone who enjoys watching the \\"new\\" shows that come out each season.

Although the dust jacket had been taped (expected for an item of this age) it was still intact and the cover of the actual book is like new.  I'm impressed with this seller and will surely order again if they are one that offers what I seek.
B001QTXM5Y|4.0|This film was a near-revolution in movie-making, based on a novel tough to make into a movie.  The two-disk DVD added a great deal to the entertainment value, explained how the movie was made, and the extended version DVD helped make the story more understandable and entertaining visa vie the theatrical release.  One can only hope that other attempts at making movies of leading graphic novel will follow this successful release.
0399250395|5.0|The Very Hungry Caterpillar Pop-up Book exceeded all my expectations with its elaborate pop-up art that brings this story to life!  My son loved the board book already, but when he received the pop-up book for his 1st birthday, he was shrieking in delight over the exquisite 3-dimensional wonders that surprised him on every page. While the book is recommended for ages 3 and up, I think it's worth introducing to younger ages - you just need to be careful to keep it out of arms reach. It's definitely a wonderful gift idea and will be a treasured part of our family's library.
B002GY9F9K|4.0|Don't expect it to be the books, what works as entertainment via written word largely doesn't translate in the same manner when placed on film. Book pacing generally makes for drawn out or crawl periods in a television program or film. That aside, most of the audience that's tuning into these programs aren't familiar with the books and aren't expecting anything aside from an entertaining episode-to-episode experience. Honestly, just pleasing fans of the book(s) wouldn't allow these shows to survive a season, in most cases. Those type of numbers aren't enough to ping as success in/on mainstream television.     If your a fan of the genre and enjoy good fantasy (not excellent, but far from crap as-well), and haven't looked into LotS - give it your attention..I think you'll be pleased.     If your a fan of the series and want to see a complete 2nd season (starting soon), and the possibility of a 3rd season - tune in to the new episodes each week (starts in November), and purchase the seasons on DvD as they become available.
B0025KVLRO|5.0|There's only so much that audio engineers can do with material that was frankly rather sloppily recorded four and a half decades ago. Back in the 1970s, I owned a high-end audio store, and as familiar as I was with the Beatles' U.S. releases, I still purchased all the Beatles LPs on British Parlophone anticipating the \\"real thing.\\" However, none of those LPs, including this album, were anything great in terms of fidelity. The sound was generally thin, brittle, weak, and lacking in detail. The U.S. versions, with all their weaknesses, were better. But keep in mind that high-quality audio systems were very rare in 1962, and the engineers did the mastering, equalization, etc., with \\"record players,\\" not audio systems, in mind. It should not be surprising that the early Beatles' recordings didn't hold up so well on top-quality audio equipment.    Whatever else they have done to their manufacturing capability over the past few decades, the British have remained extremely important in terms of audio engineering. Bowers & Wilkins 801s are still damn fine speakers a quarter century after they first appeared. The British masterings of Frank Sinatra's 1950s output simply blow away the American versions. While the American engineers worried about removing hiss, the British engineers went after capturing the music, the comparison to modern digital recording be damned.    What the engineers have done with this album, and I assume the others, is dig as deep as they could into the master tapes and get us as close to the music as possible. Beware that this is not as close as possible to the sound that we heard from our GE or RCA portables. It is what we wish they could have sounded like back then. It is the Beatles reworked for the modern age and, to my mind, very successfully.    Compare this remastered version to the old LP or the early CDs. It's no contest. It's not a matter of whether the harmonica sounds squeaky or the voices on occasion sound hard. That's on the tape and can't be changed. It's a matter of detail, and balance, and definition, and capturing the music. Eight remastered CDs arrived today. I can't wait to hear the rest.
0761129235|5.0|This little book is life changing!  No, really.  It breaks down fear and shows you how to accomplish anything that is possible, step by step.  These steps do add up to a large change.  I can not say enough good about it.  Try it. It works.
B002A9OJ0Q|5.0|This album reminds me of their music from 15 yrs ago.  I think they've gone back to what made them great...I love this album!  If you like A-Ha, you will love this album and it will make a great addition to your library.      Amazon has a great price compared to other companies and shipping was quick and speedy, as always.  Thanks Amazon for giving A-Ha fans a chance to enjoy this wonderful music.
B000VSBX34|5.0|Who couldn't love this movie. It really is a romp with the Beatles. We watched this movie as a family and had a great time...my husband and I singing the whole thing! A blast from the past!
B0001IN07Q|4.0|This cd and dvd was recorded in 2004.  Just about 2 years after Buble started making great music.  He is still kind of raw in this dvd footage but you can tell, as in one of his songs, \\"The Best is Yet to Come.\\"  He isn't wearing Boss suits like he is now but he could then and now belt out a good rendition of \\"Nice 'n Easy\\", \\"Fever\\" and \\"Kissing a Fool\\" just to name a few.  Great music produced by the \\"Hit Man\\" himself, David Foster.  Great cd and dvd to listen to and watch if you want to see the early Buble.
B0009MAO46|2.0|The copy we purchased would only play on 1 out of 3 of our DVD players.  Can't explain why this is.  All other movies play just fine.  So we rented a copy of Toy Story (same version)from the video store and it played just fine on all our DVD players.  It makes me question the video I received from this seller.  Something is just not right.  I will not purchase from them again.
B000088E6D|5.0|This album was recorded in 2003, just as he was getting his feet wet.  \\"How Can You Mend a Broken Heart\\", \\"Put Your Head on My Shoulder\\" and \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\" are just a few of the ballads.  Old Blue Eyes is represented by \\"Come Fly With Me\\" and \\"Summer Wind\\".  \\"Sway\\" and \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\" are upbeat.  David Foster did it again with this album.  A void has been filled since losing Sinatra and Martin by Buble recording their music.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|This is the second sweeper I have purchased.  My daughter took the first because she loved it too.  This was recommended to me from someone who also loved it.  The product picks up much better than higher priced similar items such as the Shark, etc.  It is light and great for the sweep up after meals or between the heavy duty weekend cleaning.  I highly recommend this product.
B00070Q7VO|4.0|Recorded in 2005.  This has songs which are really beautiful when he sings them.  \\"You Don't Know Me\\". \\"Try a Little Tenderness\\" and \\"You and I\\" to name a few.  His voice is so smooth and he sings with feelings, it makes for a romantic evening with that someone special.  He is so good with his delivery and he has come a long way since Foster brought him to the States.  Lucky us!
B00197POXG|3.0|The movie is a fantastic movie, There are few of the DVD's that has got problem with the sound system and make a very bad noise on it.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Pros: It's very comfortable on my left hand. I use it for all my FPS games and it works like a charm, I can also change the LCD and backlit keys to any color I want which is a nice add-on.<br /><br />Cons: There is no row of keys above the the WASD keys such as for numbers or the F keys which would be really helpful for MMORPG's such as Aion or WoW. And there is no quick profile switch to switch between profiles unless you go into the program which is what you have to do.<br /><br />5/5 - Just some small features that I would of liked to see but hey when they make a new one hopefully they'll have those features.
0375413405|5.0|I can't say enough about this book.  I love it!  Should have had this when I first got married.  This will be my gift at every wedding shower. Everything you need to know is in it.  Great recipes too.
B000BAQ8A0|5.0|Purchased this for my Mom she loves juan diego florez and was not disapointed in this production.
B001FB55H6|5.0|A must buy, I really loved the comic and they made a faithful translation to the screen(despite some changes that I feel was needed).  Malin Ackerman is hot as Silk Spectre II and the action was awesome.  Jackie Earle Haley was spot on as Rorschach and pretty much made the movie, a great buy for your blu-ray collection.
0684857219|5.0|This is the mother of all books or guides about body building.  It covers everything you need to know about the subject.  New developments, equipment, etc., have been made in the sport since the publication of the book, but it's still a great reference.  If you apply its contents, you WILL get results.
0307266303|5.0|I've never run a lick in my life but I loved this book.  I bought it for my athletic son-in-law but wanted to check it out first (he loved it too)  and I found the stories of the Tarahumara and the super athletes to be fascinating.
0439023491|5.0|My 12 year old son and I were fighting over who got to read Catching Fire first.  We shared the book and neither one of us was disappointed.  We think we liked it even better than Hunger Games.
1840225564|5.0|The works of Jane Austin have been written about by far better writers than myself...all I know is this is \\"writing\\" the way writing is supposed to be in a civilized society...a \\"must have in any literate household\\"!<br />Beautifully presented in a tome that can be passed on to the next generation.<br />Exquisite!
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I love this stuff so much, I would probably buy and enjoy a box set of these albums that play all the songs backwards.  I am convinced that Lennon and McCartney have altered my brain, in a wonderful way.  Its amazing the pleasure I get listening to the Beatles.  The delight has not been diminished by 45 years
B0025KVLTM|4.0|Having spent some time listening to the remastered CD of Sgt Pepper, I don't understand what all the fuss is about.    Don't get me wrong: Sgt Pepper is an ambitious and brilliant album which is as fresh today as it was when I pulled the shrink wrap off my vinyl copy in June 1967. In fact, I'm amazed at how attentive I still am listening to it. It's not my favorite album, but it's very, very close.    But I've compared the remastered CD to the 1987 CD carefully through a good system, both on speakers and headphones, and aside of the greater volume in the remastered CD, it doesn't sound any different to me than the earlier one. When I make the volume equal between the two, I can't tell which is which without looking.    Out of curiosity, I ripped the same three tracks from each copy to WAV format and looked at the wave forms in my PC's recording software (the title track, \\"She's Leaving Home\\" and \\"Lovely Rita\\"). The difference in amplitude is striking (and it explains why the new one's bass seems louder in direct comparison) but aside of that, the wave forms look very similar. I've read that the stereo remasters were subjected to a little compression, but I don't hear any difference from that treatment.    I don't think anyone is pulling a fast one here, and I expect the EMI engineers worked dilligently to make the most of the music. But I have a feeling that modern technology and engineering skills can do only so much with 42-year-old recordings laid down and down-mixed repeatedly on four-track equipment.    To those who hear better sound, more power to you, but I hear nothing in the new CD that I don't hear in the old one. This is the reason I give the CD four stars instead of five. The album itself rates five, but while those who don't already have a copy of Sgt Pepper won't go wrong with this one, they also won't go wrong with the previous CD, unless they want the more authentic packaging.    (BTW, for some reason the stereo version of \\"She's Leaving Home\\" was produced at a slightly slower speed than the mono version. The result is that the song is about a quarter-tone flat and has a decidedly dreary sound, particularly in McCartney's voice. However, this is not a fault in the remastered CD; it's always been that way going back to the original LPs. I don't know why this was done, but the mono version puts the song in an entirely different light, and it should be sought out. If you don't have the dough for the mono box set, find someone who has the mono LP and give it a listen.)
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I have only read the book one time, after getting completely hooked on the 1995 A&E version of Pride and Prejudice and watching it about six times this year alone, so I am probably not the most qualified person to write my objections to the 2005 piece of filth, but after reading what everyone else had to say, I could not keep silent either. Here are my objections as follows:    1. Kiera Knightley- Hollywood clearly cannot tell the difference between a great actress better suited to the role of the intelligent Elizabeth Bennett (as in, almost anybody but K.K.) and a walking, talking, beanpole who claims to have read the book, but I don't think she did because if she had she would not have fudged this role up so badly with all the excessive giggling, outspokenness to her parents that was more or less non-existant during that time period, and for goodness sakes, somebody tell her to please close her mouth. Sexiness is appropriate in modern-day romantic comedies, but NOT in period pieces such as this one, or at least not the kind K.K. displayed. A woman from that time certainly did not run around outside with her hair down, or in her nightgown, and they almost never went outside without a hat or bonnet of some sort, which, I can't recall seeing K.K. wearing one, even after forcing myself to watch this film three times. Also, somebody please tell that girl to eat once in a while! I find it hard to believe that somebody from that time period, who did no housework and clearly had time to kill by making the audience sick by spinning on a swing, could be that skinny, when a typical daily diet from back then included a great consumption of whole milk, cheese, butter, bread, and eggs. Fattening fare that would have made a person look at least healthy, not like somebody who had not even seen puberty. Kiera Knightley was totally wrong for that role, having too modern of a face, and too thin a figure. I'm sorry Kiera, but you should stick with modern flicks. As a final irritationon this subject, I might add that she rattled her lines off so fast in some scenes that I hardly knew what she said, which is pretty sad for a person like me who is more than familiar with the dialogue. I believe that in a film with language that is as old as this, the lines should be spoken more slowly, to give our modern minds time to translate and understand what was said.   2. Fitzwilliam Darcy- I felt absolutely nothing for this film's portrayal of the character whatsoever. There was nothing in him that made him the least bit likeable or desireable, and that haunted look that was constantly plastered to his face just depressed me.   3. Charlotte Lucas- '\\"Don't judge me, Lizzy!\\"' Pul-eeeze. The film portrayed Charlotte's acceptance of Mr. Collins as being that she was unhappy to be marrying him, like she was trapped. In the book, she was actually in persuit of a comfortable home, and wasted no time in securing Mr. Collins for herself, even though he was not necessarily her first choice. But being older than the typical marrying age back then, beggars cannot be choosers, as the saying goes, and she may have become one eventually had she remained a spinster.  4. The Costumes- I thought they were completely inaccurate for the time period, and terribly boring and colorless, especially the one Knightley wore in her first scene. Yuck, and I don't know what was up with her hair, but it just did not go with her modern-looking face. Speaking of hair, I didn't know that Marie Antoinette was cast to play Lady Catherine de Burgh. And could anybody honestly tell Lydia and Kitty apart with their identical pigtail/ringlet combinations?     I honestly do not know how in the world this movie received four stars from the critics, who quite obviously have never read this book. I am sorry for the hordes of disappointed fans out there who were expecting something great (as I did), only to get spoon-fed this '\\"barely tolerable\\"' adaptation, only to choke on it after the credits rolled. Congratulations Hollywood, on ruining yet another (what could have been a) great film (just like Eragon got ruined) by attempting to 'modernize' it and change it to what you think the audience would want. Well, if it isn't broken, don't fix it! This is one of those stories in which everything was perfectly fine just the way it was. But (surprise!) some idiot out there had to open their mouth and suggest 'changes.' Well, would it be too much of a 'change' to get it right? If you are watching Pride and Prejudice for the first time, watch the A&E Firth and Ehle version. I haven't seen the one that was made in the 1980's yet, but I am willing to bet that it totally blows away the 2005 version.    Anecdote: I eventually did view the 1980's version of Pride and Prejudice, and it WAS way better than the 2005 version! Still not as good as the 1995 one, but still worth seeing and better represented.
630469878X|1.0|Three things in this movie are unbelievably stupid--the two main characters and the plot.  Let's see--a girl spends the whole night flirting with a guy, then he gets nasty in the parking lot and--with the help of her friend--she pushes him away.  End of story, right?  No--friend pulls out a gun and shoots the guy who is no longer a threat to either of them.  Ok--temporary insanity--not really self-defense, but they can probably get away with calling it self-defense.  Instead, no, they run away.  During their \\"trek\\" Gina Davis becomes such an imbecile and so annoying the viewer almost wants to commit an act of violence against her.  (she sleeps with a stranger and then leaves him alone in a hotel room that happens to contain all of her best friend's money.)  Sarandon's character, by contrast, is smart and likable--smart, that is, at least until she decides to take a seven-hour detour around Texas because she does not want to be in a state where something traumatic once happened to her.  Okay, understandable, to a point--but no.  Someone who is fleeing for her life doesn't have time for that kind of sentimentality.  And she has her (albeit moronic) friend to think of too.  Anyway, between the two of them they make sure that there is absolutely no way they'll succeed, and sure enough they don't.<br /><br />A feminist movie?  Are people kidding?  If I wanted to hate women, and think \\"after all women are idiots\\", I'd watch this movie.<br /><br />And come on.  The \\"women good, men bad\\" business is a little old by now, don't you think?  The absurdity of the male stereotypes in this film is pathetic.<br /><br />And finally, the story isn't even interesting.<br /><br />If you want a movie about people rebelling against conformity or whatever, and trekking across America while doing so, watch Transamerica.  Not flawless by any means, but the characters are all adults (as no one is here) none of them is a cardboard stereotype (as everyone is here) and the story is interesting and believable.
B000NA28I4|1.0|My husband found this movie in the trash on his garbage route one day, and now I know why it should have remained there deteriorating for all eternity. I loved the book, but after watching this piece of crap movie, I was so angry at all of its patheticness, inaccuracy,and the ten-thousand things they got totally wrong that I actually burst into tears, and than chucked it back into the trash. I even have a distinct memory of cursing out the television set during the course of the film. I mean, come on; they couldn't even make one simple thing, such as the characters looks, be consistant with how they were portrayed in the book? Last time I checked, Eragon had DARK hair, Brom was old and had long hair and a beard, and Arya was a black-haired elf (and where were her pointy ears in the film?), just to name a few. The only thing I was even remotely satisfied with was the CG effects on Sapphira, as well as Rachel Weiz's portrayal of her. I have no wish to completely re-state all of the negative things about this film, but I will say that it is THE WORST film adaptation of a book that I have ever seen. Yes, I do realize that not every single thing in a film based on a novel can be 100% accurate, but this film didn't even come close to hitting the halfway mark, let alone the full 80-90% that successful film adaptations achieve, not even remotely. Even a parody of the book would have been way better. Even if I had never read the book before seeing the film, I know I would have considered this movie to be trash. It hurtled along at a pace so fast that I hardly knew what was going on (and I had read the book several times by then!), and I was terribly fed up with every little thing they changed, omitted, or just completely flubbed up. I wish a real director would take this project on, like Peter Jackson or James Cameron. Has anybody noticed that a second film depicting book 2 has not (at least to my knowledge) been made yet? Thank God that the film makers spared us a second abomination.
B00005JKGK|1.0|Someone actually described this film as presenting \\"eight totally unique stories\\".  Actually, it's the same story again and again, drearily repeated: good Chinese woman abused by horrible Chinese man.  I cannot believe anyone's vision was ever limited enough to produce a film in which one character after another is presented as such a caricature.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I got what I wanted at a great price. I like the seller who does what they promise.
B001AQTWF2|1.0|This is what drugs sound like. She has lost the strength in her voice. It's sad to hear such a beautiful voice that has gone downhill and keeps rolling and rolling down. I would not buy anything from her any longer. I've lost my respect for her as an artist. There is nothing more to say.
B000Y7ZHCU|4.0|Great performance for this performer. Interesting and new application of back up artist and interaction with the same.
B00004ST9Q|5.0|Great DVD with all of Houston's videos. Reminds you of how great her music and videos were. Welcome Back Whitney
B002BSHWUU|3.0|If you are expecting these CD's to sound as good as the 'Love' cd- save your money.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|This is the best show ever.  I can almost always count on something happening that I didnt expect to happen.  It is full of surprises every episode.
0060765380|2.0|Don't read this book if you're in medicine, the life sciences or in the HAZMAT world. It's so full of errors and bad assumptions from page one that it's distracting from the story. Ugh- it was torture to get through.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|This combo of cd and DVD is awesome! It makes one realize what's RIGHT with the world, instead of what's wrong. Possibilities are endless, and it just makes me smile!
1932100660|1.0|Bought this book after it was reviewed quite well and recommended.  However, I am disappointed that the actual data of the China Study directly contradict the books message.  It was actually not animal protein that was statistically significant, but WHEAT!  Recommending \\"whole-grain wheat\\" is scientifically against what the statistics showed, gluten has shown to have very inflammatory properties in double blind studies.<br /><br />I recommend \\"ultrametabolism\\" or \\"protein power\\" instead
B0009K7ESW|4.0|6 short movies by different film makers each corresponding to 1 of the 6 suites. I loved hearing the cello suites (I had not listened to them all before), although each was separated into the different parts/dances and there is dialogue or other items interspersed between them. I will probably buy the CDs some time. I found the direction the movies/projects took very diverse and interesting, and there was one I did not particularly like. I found the sound of the dialogue in the 5th movie a little too quiet, but that may be deliberate as it has a very visual theme. The 6th with Torvill and Dean is simply stunning. Yo-Yo comes across as such a deep person as well as a musical genius. I am very glad I bought these, and I will be watching them over again... There is some CD-ROM content on the discs which is OK, but to me it was a minor addition - the different interpretations of the suites put into film is fascinating.
0385340575|3.0|Like all Lee Child novels, Gone Tomorrow is an irresistible page-turner.  Reacher is in top form - tough, observant, bold and brilliantly deductive.  That said, the book suffers from the main flaw evident in the previous twelve works.  The antiheros are psychopathic sadists who exist only to provide Reacher with the moral justification to kill them.  This book is further burdened by a vanishingly unlikely chief villain who is dispatched in an equally unbelievable combat scene.  The subordinate henchmen don't merit any character development.  They're simply anonymous swarthy men who go down like tin ducks at a shooting gallery.    While Al Qaeda terrorists are ostensibly the bad guys, Child somehow manages to make the real villains of the piece overbearing government agents, the Patriot Act and Ronald Reagan.  Anyone wondering how a British intellectual would deal with the cognitive dissonance of presumed U.S. government thuggery in the era of Hope and Change need look no further.  It's all the fault of Ronald Reagan and George Bush!    In brief, if you liked the other Reacher novels you'll like this one too.  Take it to the airport next time and your trip will be over before you know it.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Finally a Vampire story-line that gives a fresh and imaginative take on the genre! The Vampires are 'out' in the open and walk among us mortals, demanding civil rights and a place in the world. No longer in need of drinking our blood to survive they are trying to change their bloody image. The show is innovative in the way it mimics the plight of black people and the gay community's struggle for acceptance through time. It is witty and sarcastic, fearlessly showing how minorities of any kind are shunned because of their differences.<br />This show redeemed television for me after almost giving up on shows that nowadays seem to all be focused on remakes from the 90s. Like i said FINALLY some innovative television.<br />Watch it, you will be completely hooked.
B0000029LG|5.0|Michael Jackson's HIStory has alot of his #1 songs and most popular.  This was a purchase for my 13 y/o son that loves his music.  I am 38 and grew up with Michael Jackson my entire life.  It is with a sad heart I have to write a review that he is gone, but it also makes me happy that he is still touching so many people through his music.  A man that was killed by the harsh media and extortionist for money.  So many of the media tortured MJ when he was alive and then the same people in the media are now worshipping him to get ratings and make headlines.  May he get to rest in peace!<br /><br />I highly recommend this cd to all who adore Michael Jackson.  All of his music will touch your heart.  He had the voice of an Angel and heart of gold.  Michael Jackson will always be the King of Pop and the BEST entertainer that ever lived!! There will NEVER be another one in our life time.
0060925000|5.0|The book arrived on time and was in the condition I expected it.  Job well done
0671646788|5.0|This book is a must-read for anybody who wants to be more successful!  It doesn't matter if your idea of success involves money, fame, power, influence, status, or any combination of these things.    Read the book, pay attention, and apply what you learn.  Do these three things and you'll be closer to success (as you define it).
0446560065|5.0|If you are a fan of Simon's wonderful YouTube channel, or a lover of cats and their antics, or if you like funny comic books. Everyone knows that there are gazillions of cats on line--cartoon videos, real life videos, and, of course, LOLcats. With all these cats, do we really need a cartoon book, esp. one who already has millions of internet fans? After reading and re-reading Simon's book, I say an emphatic YES! This format draws the reader into a different world than that of video, and it conveys a different layer of enjoyment--one in which the reader \\"participates\\" in the action because s/he must imagine and interpret what goes on \\"between the frames\\" in order to achieve \\"closure\\" which we need for understanding. (I've been reading a bunch of graphic novels lately, and I also read and recommend Scott McCloud's excellent book, \\"Understanding Comics\\") I'm a big fan of LOLcats, too, but the books derived from these, like many books based on websites don't really have anything new or interesting to say, and are often a disappointment. Simon's Cat, in his very own book, helps the reader to identify with both him as well as Simon in his life as a cat, and with Simon as the human whom he owns, FTW.    (Unfortunately, real life calls me away, so check back later; I'll write more later. I hope that this paragraph adds to the discussion about the book, and why I like and recommend it. BFN.)
B001FB55H6|5.0|I loved this movie!  I am not sure where all the negative reviews were about but it matched the graphic novel exactly.  This was never meant to be your happy go lucky superhero story and that may be where people got confused.
1596912863|4.0|This short book and quick read was quite entertaining.  It is about a woman obsessed with Jane Austen's books - isn't everyone?  That is what made me want to read it as Pride and Prejudice is still my favorite book - and movie!  In this story, Jane is still single though in her early 30's, which is quite acceptable in the modern age.  However, she seems unable to commit to a boyfriend because she has the \\"Mr. Darcy\\" image in her head.  When her aunt passes away, she leaves Jane an \\"inheritance\\" of a nonrefundable trip to a resort in England where they play the parts of people from Austen's books.  It becomes confusing about who is playing a part and who is a guest, though we learn that everyone has a part of some kind.  I laughed out loud and loved the story!
B0000844I8|5.0|I was very satisfied with my purchase. I have loved this movie for so many years now.  A friend of mine told me to go online and see if I could find it. When I did, I was amazed. Not only did I get the movie I wanted, I got it new, and at a really great deal, and the ULITMATE edition on top of it all.  I really am glad that I found what I wanted and will be looking to Amazon.com again for all my future desires.  Thanks Amazon
B002BSHXJA|5.0|Some people may not understand the reason for the relatively high price for this set. The set is manufactured in Japan for all EMI affiliates worldwide. If you are not familiar with the Japanese \\"cardboard album cover replica\\" CD editions, it should be explained that these are precision-crafted with great attention to detail in re-creating the original album covers, right down to paper texture and album cover fabrication technique(paper slick over heavy cardboard for \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\", the front cover flap folding over the rear of the album cover for early Parlophone albums, and the \\"White Album\\" discs having black inner sleeves and the discs slipping into the top of the sleeve as on early UK L.P. pressings).    The manufacturing of the discs shows Japan's fanatic attention to quality control, giving you blemish-free discs in plastic inner sleeves, which with proper care will keep the discs in pristine condition.  All of the original mono mixes are reproduced faithfully, correctly and with excellent mastering. The mono mixes of \\"It's All Too Much\\", \\"All Together Now\\", are new to official CD  and the mono mix of \\"Hey Bulldog\\" is previously unheard.  The albums included are \\"Please Please Me\\", \\"With The Beatles\\",\\"A Hard Days Night\\",\\"Beatles For Sale\\",\\"Help\\",\\"Rubber Soul\\",\\"Revolver\\",\\"Sgt.Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\",\\"Magical Mystery Tour\\", \\"The White Album\\" and the 2-CD \\"Mono Masters\\"(a mono equivalent of \\"Past Masters\\", but with a somewhat different track listing). The \\"Yellow Submarine\\" soundtrack album is not included, as it has now been established that the Uk & Japan mono L.P. had merely been folded down from the stereo mix.  Don't let the marketplace merchants charge you triple for a supposedly \\"Japanese\\" pressing, since all copies of the mono box ARE Japanese.  As for The Beatles' music, you don't need me to tell you that they are timeless classics.
B00005GL0U|5.0|Abbey Road [import Japan]-2000.<br />There has been a whirlwind of activity with the new remastered releases of The Beatles and my review will only add to it.<br /><br />There are only a few albums that I would consider buying the more expensive Japanese reissues and this album is one of them.<br />I bought it on amazon's site from a third party for $18.90 USD Used including S/H and just got finished  reviewing it in iTunes.<br />Just to let you know I always import the songs into iTunes at 320kbps with VBR set to the highest quality.<br />With the price of hard drives these days being so low there isn't a reason to not import them at the highest MP3 quality.<br /><br />I'm now listening to the CD on my stereo system and there is no sighs of 'brightness' or 'loudness' that some have complained about on the new 2009 reissues.<br />Check out 'Loudness war' at wikipedia. It will describe in more detail what some customers were complaining about on amazon about the quality of the new ones.<br /><br />I'm ambivalent about remastering with the loudness cranked up because there is always  a silver lining around a cloud.<br />What I mean is you can hear all the quieter passages while enjoying the beautiful 'notes' coming out your cars tailpipe. LOL.<br /><br />I have bought other Japanese imports of my special albums that meant alot to me and they ALWAYS sounded great.<br />It must be their manufacturing and equipment that makes the difference.<br /><br />My advise: Mentally go over your collection of music that was the 'soundtrack of your life' and decide for yourself if you want the BEST sounding CDs available, then get the Japanese reissues and you will have no 'buyers regret'.<br /><br />A friend from Portland Oregon USA.

B000065M00|5.0|There's no doubt that Peter Gabriel's So it's one of the most innovative and break through albums of the 80's. Definitely a must when defining 80's rock music. 8 tracks that can live by their own but at the same time shape a strong full album. There are no opened dots here impossible not to listen to all the tracks over and over once you start<br /><br />JM<br />[...]
0743581490|4.0|This audio book was very good....especially entertaining with the author, Frank McCourt, reading it with his Irish accent.  Really got you feeling that you were actually in Ireland.  I recommend that you watch the movie after reading the book.  The movie was good....left out a few things that were in the book but followed most all of the important stuff that was in it.

B000A2RRF4|5.0|After not having the privilege of attending a Michael Jackson concert I decided to purchase his DVD's after his death and boy was I in for a treat when I viewed the Live in Bucharest dvd. I can now see why the world considered him to be the King of Pop, regardless of your personal views of him, he had a talent that can not be duplicated.<br /><br />After the burial of my nephew, my family and I sat back and watched the video and like I was they were awestruck. This is one awesome concert, that is all I can say.Anyone who was not blessed in watching him live, should watch this DVD, you get a chance to see first hand what the hoopla was all about. RIP MiJac

What a great series to give to reluctant readers and those whose prior reading hasn't \\"done it\\" for them! Gave the Hunger Games to a senior today, and watched his face light up. He will be back, very soon, for this one. Thank you Ms Collins, for a series that is fast-paced, exciting, and addicting! Authors out there: we need LOTS MORE Of this sort of book!

0312944926|5.0|I read digital fortress a long time ago but I recently just ordered the new edition on Audio CD. I can't wait. Because Dan Brown does such a great job at explaining the way encryption works and helping the reader to understand the war our Government plays in cyberspace, but in such a way that it fells like a discovery and a learning experience. I can feel my brain expanding! This Novel is great fun and I highly recommend it to any reader enjoys a good geo-politial techno thriller.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1440149534 Devil's Verse: Natasha Azshatan Unlocks Ancient Mysteries, Reveals Secrets, And Wrestles With Demons As She Fights To Stay Alive]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0385504225 The Lost Symbol]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0345505476 The Paris Vendetta: A Novel (Cotton Malone)]]

It's a nice way of looking at something in a new point of view. I'm sure there is something to be learned from this book. It's a quick read. and it's just plain good.

Space exploration needs to stay in the control of out Government Agecy NASA, and not in the hands of multinational corporations that don't have our best interest at heart.

0307454541|3.0|I found parts of this book to be very exciting and interesting and then other parts a struggle to get through.  We read it for my book club last month and out of 8 people I was the only one who had finished the book because it was hard to get stay interested and get through.
B00007L4OM|4.0|Great set-up/story. Great characters. Two things I would have liked: more confrontational scenes between Reno & the bad guy and his goons; and the action ending more drawn-out and more creative than a simple bank shoot-out.
B0019HQIGS|5.0|I bought this dvd and Any Given Thursday for my husband as a gift. We've only watched this one so far. Husband is a huge JM fan, I just think he's okay, but both of us very much enjoyed this dvd. My husband's father was over, and also loves this dvd. Mu husband likes that there is backstage footage, that it's more than just a concert. Shows JM the musician, as well as JM the person. Thumbs up.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|Received my CD promptly and in new condition - just as I ordered it.  No complaints.
B001GKJ2E8|5.0|This movie is so much fun!!!!  Yeah, much of it was unrealistic but oh what fun it is to watch!!  Another reason why I enjoyed this flick so much is because the geek turned out to be this tough hero!!!!  Found his inner lion and gave them all what for!!!!!    Angelina Jolie fans are going to like her in this flick because she definitely rocked in it!!!      Highly recommend this movie!!!!
0316168815|5.0|I loved the book.  I thought it is a great story.  Excited to see how the movie turns out.  I am not much of a book reader because I generally have a hard time getting into the stories.  Not the case with this book.  It kept me intrigued throughout the story.
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|Let me say it again...  Wuved this movie!!!<br /><br />Die hard watchmen fan or not will enjoy this movie.  This movie shows that unlike \\"Superman and Friends\\" of other comics these heroes have flaws.  Through the watchmen you see that the world is not black and white but grey with all its ugliness and sometimes the right decisions are oft times the hardest ones no matter who gets hurt.<br /><br />Anyway, the action and the special effects were amazing!!!<br /><br />Warning:  Parents out there this is not a kid's flick so....<br /><br />Anyway, highly recommend this movie!!!!

045122499X|2.0|Almost a complete repeat of his Pillars of the Earth\\" but with more sex scenes. I think Erika Jong had too much to do with this version. Graphic sex in historical novels does not interest me at all; perhaps others feel differently. A little imagination goes a long way. Once again---Ken Follett straggles behind Dorothy Dunnett, who carries off the prize for historical fiction.
B00005JKNF|5.0|Helen Mirren \\"owns\\" the heart and soul of this movie. She gets the film's most moving moments & executes them with enormous grace and restraint.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|This review is for the Beatles In Mono boxset. It didn't take long after the release of the 1987 Beatles CDs to realize that they weren't the best source for quality sound reproduction of the Beatles catalog, unfortunately to find the best sources involved long searches, a hodgepodge of sources and huge amounts of money. The new stereo and mono sets do a great job of beating, or coming close to beating the holy grail versions of the different titles at a fraction of the cost. I particularly like the mono set because there is no limiting or noise reduction used, allowing the music to shine through. Beyond that there is no annoying ping pong style effects or vocals in one speaker effects that plague the stereo titles.     The mono sets are made in Japan and are stunning. The outer box is two piece slide in type construction that should easily protect the discs within. The discs are designed to look like the original album label and are stored first within a plastic inner sleeve then a paper inner sleeve designed to look like the inner sleeve of an original LP. The CD is then stored in a mini LP sleeve for further protection. The mini LP sleeves are either top loaders, inner loaders, gatefold or side loader designs that replicate the design of that particular album. To make things even better the mini LP sleeve is then kept safely within a resealable plastic sleeve. Also included is a booklet that lists studio dates, discography and some decent pictures.    Don't be fooled by mono... I know I was for years. Mono music still uses both of your speakers in a stereo setup, but each channel contains the same information. Vocals, guitars, bass and drums are all there, but believe me they are all well defined, clear and easily fill a room. I've always heard that mono was the only way to listen to The Beatles, I took a chance and was very pleasantly surprised with many of the titles. Sgt. Pepper's has been highly regarded by many, but the title that surprised me the most was The Beatles(The White Album). The Beatles is incredible in mono, the only drawback would be that Helter Skelter is shorter. As a bonus the mono set also includes original Stereo versions of Help! and Rubber Soul included on the same titled mono discs. The stereo set has the 1987 stereo mixes of Help! and Rubber Soul and not the originals.    Remember, this is the perfect boxset and is a bargain!
B000M06SU4|5.0|Beatle fans will enjoy this Beatle remix especially on vinyl, if you are not a \\"purists\\" and object to any Beatle music being remixed  in the first place. Consider that George Martin and his son remixed the Beatles music who could have done a better job?
B00003CWPL|3.0|If you like surreal movies (and I mean really strange) you might want to watch this one.  It is thought provoking and disturbing.  Easily the strangest movie I have seen.
0375701427|5.0|This was an easy transaction. The book was in the condition that the buyer said it would be! Great price and I received it in time for my class this semester!
B00005AAFS|4.0|With respect to originality and sheer poetic intensity, I consider Mutter to be one of the better Rammstein projects. Typical 'Tanz Metal' with overwrought drama, great rhythm and good lyrical sense. Lots of crowd pleasers. Rammstein songs tend to repeat themselves with respect to the rhythm and singing; there are 3-4 motifs that can be identified in almost every R. piece.<br /><br />Still, these guys are cynical and tongue in cheek, they mock us with them rainy graves, cold moons, demons screaming in the darkness:<br /><br />\\"Der kalte Mond in voller Pracht<br />h&ouml;rt die Schreie in der Nacht<br />und kein Engel steigt herab<br />nur der Regen weint am Grab..\\"
B001FB55H6|5.0|Thank you very much for the fast shippping abroad. the movie has a great picture quality and the bonus are awesome.
B001HT0LOS|4.0|This is not a high brow film.  It is pure sugar - not recommended as a daily diet but great as a sweet and silly snack.  The original version and sequels were very risque for its day and the remake does a good job of trying to update the movie without going overboard.<br /><br />An English school that accepts those girls that have been thrown out of every other school is not only in financial trouble but the government means to make an example of them too.  All of the different factions (goths, sexpots, toughies, geeks, etc.) of St. Trinian band together to save the day?<br /><br />Rupert Evertt does not do drag justice (which is amusing....) but all the  characters are fun to watch.  Colin Firth and Stephen Fry were especially great to watch.  There are a lot of talented UK actors who appear in this movie and then there is a brief scene by Misha Barton.<br /><br />This movie has more of a cult following then strong comedy to recommend it.  It is being released in dvd in the U.S. January 2010.  The movie studio is hoping to cash in on teenagers but I'm not sure it will appeal to the masses.<br /><br />It certainly is not worth the high price tag of third party sellers.  Wait for the US distribution and decide whether you are a fan or not.
B001PPLIEG|5.0|Though others have commented that this movie pales in comparison with Casino Royale, it is actually better for a few reasons:  - Daniel Craig is more comfortable in his role as Bond  - The settings are better  - Better plot  Casino Royale spent too much time in the casino, which wasn't interesting.  Quantum of Solace has a more interesting plot which picks up just minutes after the end of Casino Royale.  With that said, watching Quantum of Solace without having seen Casino Royale would be difficult.
B00095MLGC|3.0|A fair introduction (although a sophomore) into their spacey sound, though the usual engrossing production and light progressive guitar segments still needed some integrity tweaking so as to not sometimes exude the energy of the Top Gun score.

185686863X|5.0|Was a great book to allow you to look at how to put in place the important issues that will allow your business move from being just a good company and become a great company by most all standards.  It also allows you to look at many things in the business world that you might think are the reasons but just are not true.  The best part is that it tells you that much of what takes you to great are many basic principals that have been around for years.
0240810961|5.0|This is not a step-by-step, How To Draw book.  It's better than that.  Every artist of every skill level can benefit from this book because it doesn't just teach you the How of art, but the WHY.  It forces you to really think about why you draw, how you can communicate more effectively with your audience, and just what purpose your art projects have.  Drawing is just as much a mental act as it is a physical act.  In fact, the physical act of drawing depends completely on the artist's experiences and intention.  Without any sort of introspection, an artist's work can fall flat and just look like a lifeless collection of lines.  Why we move our pencils is just as important as how we move them.    Along with a good mental jolt, there is a ton of instructional advice on drawing itself; such as keeping a sketchbook, analyzing the gesture of live models and people, constructing characters out of simple shapes, drawing with clarity, almost everything an artist would need (I say \\"almost\\" because the book is so dern chock full of information that I have yet to finish and digest it all yet!).  There are also some insightful analyses of character art and rough animation frames, satisfying the Disney-ophile in us animators.    Even if this book isn't what you might have expected or feel that you need right now, if you are an aspiring artist or an established professional (or a tweenie, such as myself) I would still urge you to purchase it.  At some point in your life you will need a book like this for a hearty inspirational boost, a pick-me-up when you're feeling down, or a good kick in the *ss when you've settled stubbornly in your ways.  It has certainly helped me.    Besides, if Walt Stanchfield's teachings were good enough for Glen Keane, it d*mn sure is good enough for the rest of us!

B002KCYIEA|4.0|I wasn't expecting a lot from this movie - considering I am not a Beyonce fan, but I was surprised.  The movie moves quickly and has a lot of twists and turns I definitely wasn't expecting.  There are trite parts no doubt, but for a fun and suspenceful movie I would recommend this one.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|OK, I'm not a big fan of homosexuality; it just doesn't concern me, but....who can deny that this is a great performance?? Heath Ledger was an incredible talent;  if u met him, you would fall in love with him no matter if you were a man or a woman.<br /><br />Gay or straight, after all, they were in love; Try to understand that, dear perfect people.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|This movie comes as close as any I have seen to what it is like to make music with other musicians. The scene in the music store is a perfect example of those rare moments when two people sit down to play for the first time and \\"magic\\" happens. The scene toward the end of the film when the musicians leave the recording studio in the early morning hours captures the essence of recording music perfectly. Unlike some of the other reviewers I liked the fact that they relationship between the Guy and the Girl did not follow the typical Hollywood arc. Another refreshing departure from the standard movie musical was the relationship between the Guy and his father. The music is a matter of taste. I happened to like it and understand that street musicians cannot deal in subtleties; they have to grab the audience by the throat. This movie's other achievement it to reimagining the musical in a more realistic way, and on that level it is a triumph. The music is more organic and not artificially injected into the story. The fact that it was done on an incredibly low budget shows that the concept and story matter more than anything else in making a great film. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
0792162803|4.0|Molly Shannon is hilarious; it's outrageous that when you Google\\" super star\\", you get Tom Cruise...

B002BSHWUU|3.0|I am a \\"first generation\\" Beatles' fan. I am a Hard-core, FANATIC fan.  The real deal. I probably have every possible mix, remix, transmix, pre-mix, and post-mix of their albums in existence.  I have every boot-leg variation one can purchase, Japanese, German, British, American.  When these sets were announced I was excited, but cautious.  I also have a top-of-the-line system and speakers. I will skip the specs and brand names-- I hate when people list all those details.  I have perfect pitch, I'm a musician, I grew up playing pubs...I own my own recording studio and dozens of instruments, including 1963 and 1961 Hoffner Basses, 1959 and 1964 Rickenbackers (among others, six and 12 strings), Gretsch, etc.  Not bragging, just trying to lay down my credentials.  When \\"Meet the Beatles\\" was originally released I had to save my lunch money (.25 per day) and, on the 12th day, I bought it for $2.29, then everyone single and album after that.  So, been there, still am.  Forty-five years later, still buying them and will continue to do so.    I spent most of the day today listening to the Mono versions.  They sound a \\"smidgen,\\" that means a tiny-little bit, better than the original releases, and about the same as several of their better bootlegged album versions:  Example: The Millenium Remasters Collection, which claims \\"24 Bit mastering,\\" whatever it really is, sounds as good as this (those have the mono and stereo versions).  I even took time and selected some songs at random and played one, then the other, back and forth, listening carefully to hear if I could detect a worthwhile difference.  Nope. Tried Dr. Ebbets' versions too, same thing.  Milleniums are better but, you REALLY have to try to hear distinctions and then, once in a while, you go, \\"ah, yeah, right THERE! you could hear the tambourine a little better!\\"    Haven't listened to the stereo versions yet, will do that later this week.    The good?  The packaging is really nice, cool as can be, 100% better thanthe Capitol Versions \\"packaging.\\"  Can't really read any of this stuff without a magnifying glass but, all of this stuff looks really cool on the shelf, makes me smile.    Should you (whomever is reading this) buy these sets?  Up to you!  Would I buy them again?  Sure!  But, as far as the Mono versions, maybe if you are in a lab, in an isolated hyperbaric chamber in a perfectly controlled sensory environment, no distractions, with nothing else to do and trained as an audio-engineer and blessed with absolute or perfect pitch, I doubt these are going to BLOW YOU AWAY!  Or... you can be Frazier Crane pretentious\\" and SAY they do, or highly suggestible, and THINK they do, or HYPE-friendly and \\"hear\\" what the ridiculous marketing for these things are telling you to hear.    Will I buy the REMASTERED sets when those are released in 20 years?  You bet!  If I'm still alive, of course!  It's The Beatles!  Duh!    For now I'm just keeping my fingers crossed for a WORTHWHILE \\"Let it Be\\" DVD box set--say, a totally cleaned up, remixed, remastered FOUR-DVD-set, not the insulting \\"regular release with a 'bonus' 30 minutes of additional footage\\" they've been testing the waters with.  Oh, and their videos.      Cheers!
B000HT386M|5.0|It's all in the title! I don't want to ruin the movie (if you have not watched it by now).

It can't get  any better!
B000024E9M|5.0|The album begins with Peter Gabriel singing a cappella.  The melody he sings has a celtic feel, and then the band joins in.  The tune goes through several different layers of dynamics and tempo.  That tune is followed by the first Genesis hit single, \\"I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)\\" which is similar to some of the stuff Peter Gabriel did later on in his solo career.  It's a good pop song, and it works really well.  \\"Firth of Fifth\\" begins so powerfully, and has a beautiful guitar solo in it.  It's a beautiful tune, and like the opening track, it goes through several different layers.  Phil Collins has become known as the lead singer for Genesis.  However, on this album, Peter Gabriel was the lead singer.  Phil Collins was given the spotlight for his own song, \\"More Fool Me,\\" which was a beautiful song.  It's probably the softest song on the album.  \\"The Battle of Epping Forest\\" is a track that several of the members themselves have criticized, but it's not that different from \\"Get 'Em Out By Friday\\" from the previous album.  \\"After the Ordeal\\" is an instrumental track, and several of the members didn't like it, which is what led to Steve Hackett (the guitarist, and the person who composed \\"After the Ordeal\\") to leaving the band.  Obviously, that was only a small part of it.  The album concludes with \\"The Cinema Show\\" and \\"Aisle of Plenty.\\"<br /><br />This is definitely a favorite Genesis album of mine, and although they have become known for their Phil Collins-era music, I think that this is Genesis at some their best.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie is one of the most outlandishly absurd movies you will ever watch. Don't you crave laughing aimlessly with no hidden message waiting to bite you in the a...????<br />Jon Heder is a great actor, watch him in \\"just like Heaven\\" and give him another chance because he is worth it. He made the \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" famous, not vice versa!
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I have to be honest, it took me 2-3 times to watch this version of Jane Eyre in order to fall in love with it. My all time favorite was and still is Timothy Dalton/ Zelah Clarke (1983) version, but this 2006 version is also wonderful. I thought that both lead actors did a great job. Moreover, I liked that this version had more scenes where Mr.Rochester interacts with Jane. I made my husband watch this movie with me, and he liked it too. Thus, I have to agree with some reviewers before me that if you are looking for a faithful to the novel version, watch 1983 version, but if you want to be greatly entertained, watch this one.
B00005O5CM|4.0|As funny as this movie has remained, over the years, it still can't capture the greatness of Reese Witherspoon's performance until you watch her in other movies. Watch her in \\"Just like Heaven\\" or \\"Rendition\\", Witherspoon still has so much to give.<br /><br />P.S. don't try the \\"bend-and-snap\\" move if you are over 35 years old; nobody is watching... even if you are a blonde!
0743298039|5.0|I just finished reading The Thirteenth Tale and I couldn't have enjoyed it more.  I adore books and appreciate well-written ones and The Thirteenth Tale is certainly that!  Oh, I was skeptical at first.  It seems the fashion now to write a book on the coattails of another book or books--Wicked, The Reading Group, and so on.  I am finding it increasingly annoying, this pattern and those \\"authors\\" who become authors by capitalizing on others' literary works.  People, have you no spontaneous or original thought in your head, one to call your own?  If not, then perhaps you shouldn't be writing! Because, those of us who enjoy reading original thoughts are turned off by those of you who choose to hijack others', manipulate them, exploit them, and call them your own.  What talent does that take?    So, I purchased The Thirteenth Tale and read it cautiously.  At first.  However, it soon became very apparent that Diane Setterfield is an author in her own right.  She is a master storyteller and I will seek out all other works she produces, as soon as she can produce them!  This book was rich and the language was meaty and satisfying.  The ending was satisfying, but like a great Thanksgiving dinner--while satisfied, I still would've consumed more, if there were more put in front of me.  A book that induces gluttony--now that's a 5-star book.  That's The Thirteenth Tale.  I will spare you all of the summaries, all of the parallels drawn, all of the other synopses that so many reviewers have intimated.  I will simply say that if you love books and love a good story, you must read this book.
B00008K7AM|4.0|Whatever the message is in this movie, I still laugh every time I see it. After all, Adam Sandler is there wondering where to hide the weed. It is great performance by everybody.
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|I had the opportunity to read the graphic novel before seeing this movie.  Loved the novel and really looked forward to the movie after hearing good things about it.  Watching the movie I just found it fantastic in how it captured the graphic novel almost scene for scene.      The very minor changes in the movie, the lack of the pirate comic and the details at the end I think made it better.  The ending seemed a bit more believable.  I didn't care for the pirate comic that much reading the graphic novel, and still really didn't get any connection with it and the rest of the story.      Overall,I'd have to say this is one of my favorite comic book superheroe movies.

B002DYKP8S|5.0|This is a beautiful movie, made with care.  I'm glad it's in English, so I can understand it without having to read subtitles.  You can also listen in Mandarin, by pressing a button on your remote.  Visually stunning, and a good story too.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I gave this five stars because the writers used a chapter discarded and rewritten by Austen. Well, Austen's original chapter worked rather well on screen. If you want a copy of this chapter, go to The Gutenberg Project and download the biography of Jane Austen by one of her nephews. The makers of this movie were quite respectful to Austen. There are some points which I think could have been done better. Mr. Elliot's story differed quite a bit from the original. I didn't see the need and indeed, this rewrite detracted from the film. Amanda Root as Anne Elliot is perfection itself. All things considered, this is a solid production but the gold standard has yet to be made.
B00288KNL8|3.0|Cute animation movie... but not the best by any means. The 3-D was nauseating & we had to flip the disc after 15 minutes & watch the regular widescreen version instead.
B00005MP58|5.0|Can this movie be praise too much? No. The makers of the movie remained respectful and true to Jane Austen's P&P. This movie sets the standard by which I judge all Austen films. Indeed, I have this work in mind when I watch films based on other favorite authors. I sure wish the makers of this movie would tackle some more Austen books and maybe Bronte books, Jane Eyre, Villette, Agnes Grey.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Well whatdaya know?  My first review ever for a Beatles album or ALBUMS in this case.  Why have I never written a review for a Beatles album?  Because like most of you, I've known these records so well during the course of my lifetime, what am I going to say that hasn't been said a million times before?  I mean it's pointless really.  However, this new remastered box set provides me with a fresh start and has marked the first time in my Beatle loving life that I was able to buy their actual albums on the day of release!  Now THAT was a fun experience!  When The Beatles were first issued on CD in 1987, I was 10 years old and barely knew what a CD was, much less how they worked.  But I did know my Beatles!  I had fallen in love with them at the ripe ole age of 3 and by age 10 could sing every song forward and backward plus rattle off any bit of Beatle trivia you cared to know.  Quite a privilege to have an original '64 Beatlemaniac for a mom, eh?  Not that it took any prodding from her.  The magic of The Beatles' music took hold of me at first listen and I was immediately hooked for life.      For anyone who says these new remasters don't sound better than the original '87 releases, may I suggest an ear wax removal kit available at your nearest supermarket (or perhaps some EMITEX).  The packaging is awesome, the black box is gorgeous, and I love the way you can remove the albums with the pull of a black ribbon.  Just don't pull them out onto the floor!  I've read some complaints about the cardboard digi-paks that the new CD's come in.  Before this set was released I read that the CD's would come in limited edition \\"eco-friendly\\" packaging, so I'm guessing that these CD's will eventually be issued in standard jewel cases down the line.  I have no problem with digi-paks, as long as I remove the CD gently!  It would be too long to review every CD individually so I'm going to review their catalog by year, that should be quicker.  Here we go!    1963: PLEASE PLEASE ME & WITH THE BEATLES - So crisp, so clear, so SEPARATED!  Now I don't have a problem with the stereo mixing of \\"With The Beatles\\" because I grew up on the stereo versions of the American Capitol albums which were \\"Meet The Beatles\\" and \\"The Beatles' Second Album.\\"  However, there is no doubt that \\"Please Please Me\\" sounds better in mono.  The stereo mix is really good though and works better if you're listening to it on a big stereo system.      1964: A HARD DAYS NIGHT & BEATLES FOR SALE - The Beatles' were using four track tape machines by the time of their third album so there was a lot more room for a proper stereo mix.  I've always known both of these albums in stereo and these remasters sound fantastic!  They sound so good that I've finally been able to accept the British formats of both these records!    1965: HELP! & RUBBER SOUL - The turning point for The Beatles.  Why?  Marijuana.  Thank you Bob Dylan. I'll admit while both of these CD's sound better than ever, there is something a little \\"off\\" to my ears concerning their remastering.  I think it has something to do with the fact the 1986 digital mixes, prepared by George Martin, were used for these remasters.  I've listened to the original 1965 stereo mixes that are included on the mono CD's and I think they sound better personally.      1966: REVOLVER - The next turning point for The Beatles.  Why?  L.S.D.  Thank you Beatles' Dentist.  You are supposed to be immersed in this album when you play it and this remaster makes that easy.  \\"Love You Too\\" comes on like a stampede from the far east and \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" swirls around you in technicolor.      1967: SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND & MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR - What a year for The Beatles and what a couple of amazing albums!  Like \\"Revolver,\\" both of these will submerge you in their new remastered state.  The \\"Henry The Horse\\" break in \\"Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite\\" sounds out of this world.  The stereo panned coach sounds in \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" will make you feel like you're getting ready to be run over by it!      1968: THE BEATLES (THE WHITE ALBUM) - Not much can be said other than that the details are now clearer than ever and the entire double album now packs the wallop you've always wanted it to have!  Still can't get rid of that tape hiss on \\"Martha My Dear\\" though.  If I had to find any downside to the remaster, I guess it would be that there seems to be a little too much low end on the acoustic songs.  \\"Blackbird\\" seems to \\"boom\\" too much when it needs to \\"lilt.\\"  That might just be the fault of my old stereo system though.      1969: YELLOW SUBMARINE & ABBEY ROAD - \\"Only A Northern Song\\" is presented fully in mono for the first time, no more of that fake stereo!  And George Martin's orchestral score has never sounded more breathtaking....because that's the side of the record everyone played to death, right?  For the original experience, listen to \\"Yellow Submarine.\\"  For the remixed experience, listen to \\"Yellow Submarine Songtrack\\" from 1999.  \\"Abbey Road\\" is everything other reviews have said it is.  Simply amazing.  The looped coda to \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" sounds like a hurricane is coming straight for your house.  The medley sounds absolutely majestic.      1970: LET IT BE - And so they did.  Recorded in Jan. of 1969, with bits recorded in April of '69, Jan. of 1970, and a holdover all the way back from Feb. of 1968 (\\"Across The Universe\\"), it's far from a final, unified statement from the band.  That would be \\"Abbey Road.\\"  However, I did not think the remastering of THIS album was going to be a highlight of the box set for me, but it was, in a way I did not expect nor would have expected.  This remaster brought back the feeling that I felt when I listened to this album as a young child.  The amazing thing is I did not know how long I'd been away from this feeling until I played this remaster.  I broke down in tears on three different occasions.  In reality, the Spector-ized \\"LetIt Be\\" is actually kind of like \\"The White Album\\" really, with individual moments scattered throughout.      1962-1970: PAST MASTERS - EVERYTHING sounding great on this combined set!  The \\"Long Tall Sally\\" E.P. has never rocked harder.  But my ears are STILL to used to the American mixes of \\"I Feel Fine\\" and \\"She's A Woman\\" with all that reverb! And \\"Sie Lieb Dich\\" may prove to be better than the English \\"She Loves You\\" of all things!  Disc two sounds amazing.      THE MIN-DOCUMENTARY DVD:  In short, A WASTE!  If you own \\"Anthology\\" these \\"mini-docs\\" don't add anything new to the story.   In some cases, they get a few things WRONG!  Like using photos from the \\"Revolver\\" sessions for the \\"Rubber Soul\\" documentary.  Why couldn't they have included a DVD of all The Beatles' promo films for their singles?  THAT would have been a good idea.      There you have it.  The Beatles' Stereo Box Set.  One of the best music purchases I've ever made plain and simple.  I may have to share my favorite four uncles with billions of others around the world, but they're my four uncles and they're YOUR four uncles as well.  And the music they made for US will be a part of our lives until the day we leave here.  Thank you Uncle John, Paul, George, and Ringo.

B000060OFT|5.0|Capulet versus Montague the struggle passed down and retold for centuries , in place of  swords we find guns, words remain nearly identical. This is a piece of art at an exhilarating rate full of edgy scenes, eclipsed comedy, and camera work worthy of something odd but unique to itself. Fan of Romeo and Juliet or not there is much here to be appreciated.<br /><br />Were you one to enjoy the plays? One to take in the shoe taps on a wooden stage and the constant pace of it all? The artistic freedom of liveliness and the reverberations of soft spoken voices thirst warmth into the darkest corners of the audience look about. It's all here in a different sense, no stage though a tight wrapped location. Actively alert acting, quick shot responses give life to a normally lifeless adaptation.<br /><br />The story of supposed star crossed lovers has never been so well preserved by modernizing it adapts making it as much current as that of the original back in its day. Though much the tragedy has been spared for much later bouts of the film, it is not sparse on popping visuals and creative thinking to help this remain at a contemporary stand point for ages to come. Maybe when cars have all but disappeared, and guns are not our standard weapon will we need another remake.

1906355630|5.0|One of the people I have been following on Twitter is @AdrianDayton. (In the world of Twitter, a person puts the @ before a name when you are singling that person out to talk to or follow.)<br /><br />At the California Bar Association meeting held in San Diego last week, I bought Dayton's book, \\"Social Media for Lawyers:  Twitter Edition.\\"  I have been tweeting for the past four months, messing around, having fun, protecting my tweets, and collecting followers of mostly fellow court reporters who thought what I was doing was funny, amusing, and maybe someday would have value.<br /><br />Reading Dayton's book has opened my eyes to the power of Twitter.<br /><br />I've been following Dayton on Twitter for the past month, and I find his tweets and story to be informative and positive with action steps.  I could tell he is a kind, smart man who wants his followers to be successful.<br /><br />Dayton writes in his book about the basics of Twitter, how to get started, the theory of Twitter, and how to utilize the power of Twitter particularly as a businessperson.  I use the word \\"businessperson\\" on purpose.  The title of the book reads, \\"Social Media for Lawyers.\\"  I would argue that Dayton's book transcends law and could apply to any business in the service sector.  Dayton goes into why one should follow certain people, how to collect information, jump into a relevant conversation, the etiquette of tweeting, and most importantly how to start \\"contrarian thinking.\\"<br /><br />Last week I listened to @StephenFairley of The Rainmaker Institute speak, and he used the phrase, \\"contrarian thinking.\\"  That is my new FAVORITE phrase.<br /><br />I highly recommend Adrian Dayton's new book.  It is an easy, fast read.  Attorneys would \\"get it\\" immediately.  Twitter can be fun, but more importantly, it can be a way to create opportunity.  Dayton gives you the tool of Twitter to be a social media rainmaker.

B00005QGAX|5.0|Whhat's the difference between a good album and a GREAT album? A good album has a few stand-out songs and once you've purchased it you feel like you've made a pretty good investment, but after a few weeks or months you lose interest in it. Now, a great album is a totally different experience. A great album is one that you can put in your CD player and let run from beginning to end and not skip any songs because they are all just that good. A great album transcends time and the music never sounds dated. A great album is one that even if you don't listen to it often, you must have in your collection because it is an investment and not just a mere purchase. Bad is a GREAT album. From start to finish, you'll be hard pressed to choose just one song as your favorite. I have 3 favorites actually: Liberian Girl, Smooth Criminal, and Leave Me Alone. If you are a Michael Jackson fan, Bad is a must-have. If you are a music fan, Bad is also a must-have. The title is definitely appropriate, he was a Bad man! (in a good way) Long live the King of Pop!!
B001ILHY1I|2.0|I was very happy with the shipping and handling of this DVD, it was fast and packaged well.  However, the DVD must have had something spilled on it because when I took it out of the cover there was a liquid stain and it is really sticky!  It skips which I am assuming was caused by the sticky substance.  It just makes me wonder if these products are quality checked before they are bought and then sold?

B000JCETC4|4.0|Excellent sound from and outstanding musician...it does have Floydian sounds for those who care about that, but it has true authenticity as well that allows it to stand on it's own without comparison to any previous work(which we all know is great).

B0026NWBY2|5.0|MONEY WELL SPENT,  GEORGE HARRISON IS THE BEST, HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY FAVORITE BEATLE....
B002AOWXO0|4.0|\\"Break-Up\\" is an album it's tempting to make excuses for in advance.  Recorded over three days (\\"casual\\") back in 2006 (\\"not rushed to market\\") and now appearing in the shadow of Zooey Deschanel's and M. Ward's She & Him: Volume One (\\"not as good as...\\").<br /><br />Plus, it's a \\"concept album.\\"  Another danger sign.<br /><br />Still, I took the plunge. This album is my first investment in the music of Pete Yorn, but my second in Scarlett Johansson's musical career. Her 2008 release of Tom Waits covers \\"Anywhere I Lay My Head\\" didn't rack up a whole lot of plays on my iPod.  But the song \\"Falling Down\\" is definitely worth a download (at the very least, check out the video with its Salman Rushdie cameo). Johansson's vocals got mostly lost in her Dave Sitek-produced debut.  Here, they more than hold their own, with a bluesy delivery that works well against Yorn's laid-back vocals.<br /><br />Yorn is said to have been inspired by the Serge Gainsbourg-Brigitte Bardot \\"Bonnie & Clyde\\" collaboration of the 1960s.  And he seems to have found lyrical inspiration in the songs of the past, too, with many of the lyrics seemingly plucked from a familiar pop-heartbreak grab-bag.<br /><br />If nothing else, perhaps Scarlett Johansson will do for Pete Yorn musically what she did for Woody Allen at the movies - attract some broader interest to help perk up his career.  Which is maybe why the album is being taken off the shelf right now.  Ultimately, as it tracks the course of a relationship, the album doesn't quite live up to its early, enthusiastic excitement (\\"Relator\\").<br /><br />But there's no need to make excuses: \\"Break Up\\" is an album of considerable charms.

B002GZQYMA|4.0|Okay where to begin, it has been three years since we got a taste of Muse and there brilliantly artsy and  layered tunes.  Since their last release \\"Black Holes and Revelations\\"  Muse have really bloomed into a group capable of much more then a mere Radiohead clone.

For a single it's a tad bit long and maybe a bit too repetitive, but it hits clearly with electronic beats capable of raising a New Order fan back from the club. Reminds me a bit beat wise of a song from Battles with out the math rock complexity of course,. Now the actual title track \\"Resistance\\" (in this case track 2) is of the opposite polarity to that of \\"The Resistance\\".  Both on the same playing field as they both are electronic, but this ones less charged and more passive especially the ambience of the intro. Then the familiarity of a U2 track you may know of as \\"New Years Eve\\" is drawn, the pianos watery reverberation and path along the keys may make you think twice on the bands influences.  The third track is less then 4 minutes and is tied as the shortest song on the album along side with part two of the concept tied tracks.  \\"Undisclosed Desires\\" plays out to be a tightly chopped tune that sounds as though it'll be a sleeper single. It's not bad, nor am I saying it is a single, it is one of those tracks that have the right hooks to make it accessible, but lack the oomph to be the first single.<br /><br />\\"United States of Eurasia\\"  is a track Muse just don't seem to let die, each album they have a soft crooning piano tune and keep making a song that could be its counterpart...`USoE' is that one. To keep things a little more interesting they throw in a Queen like surge into the mix and weave it with a foreign group of scales. Speaking of reinventions \\"Guiding Light\\" (track 5) sounds very similar to \\"Invincible\\" one of Black holes cheerier moments (as it was pretty bleak). Minus the slivering guitar of \\"Invincible\\" add a loudness boost to the drums equals \\"Guiding Light\\" in a nutshell. \\"Unnatural Selection\\" track 6 is a shape shifter at that. Goes from an organ intro to a Deep Purple meets Queens of the Stone Age big muff tune. It is also the longest track on the album docking in at nearly 7 minutes!<br /><br />\\"MK Ultra\\"  (not Radioheads MK1&2) is though the synthesized strings were rolled in sugar . It is poppy, pounces, and has quick game like change ups (one part reminded me of something from the older Legend of Zelda video game series). \\"I Belong To You\\" didn't get the memo, a song like this already exists on the album elsewhere and at an earlier point! This track would be \\"Undisclosed Desires\\", they both have that one-two combo in the beginning this track has a bit more dynamics and is less buzzed out. The existence of this track is probably for the vocal chord dance in around the half way point deterring it from \\"Undisclosed Desires\\" to make it its own entity. The brassy connection around the 4:40 mark is of interest too.<br /><br />Now onto the three part mini epic sweeps, being strung on a line or playing around with the continuity of the album wont really hurt these three tracks. I feel they are all interchangeable and can give some power back to certain songs after coming off the high of such profound delicacy. The reason I say not to worry so much about the continuity here of all places is, although they are all similarly named (\\"Exogenesis\\")... The three tracks tie in together by a quick fading out. grabbing a hold that fade and phasing it into the intro of the next track. They are all orchestral though, especially the second part \\"Cross-Pollination\\".  It has a breakout moment and then shoots back down to a low volume resonating bow. The first Exogenesis \\"Overture\\" is just that, movie like, finds a stair climbing pace and walks with it indefinitely. The third and final Exogenesis  is one of  a supposed catharsis entitled \\"Redemption\\". Intro wise it sounds a bit mournful but seems to find the swinging light overhead, and ends on a brighter note piano slowing down, notes ringing a little bit longer growing a bit more sleepy and there you have reached the end.<br /><br />So what did we get here with the long awaited new Muse album? You be the judge of that, I'll tell you what I got out of it. A band that has succeeded with another hit album yearning for a more complex passive side, while still submissively pleasing the crowds near flawlessly. It achieves what is was suppose to an eclectic electronic album, its short comings are simple and literally short at that. Maybe a expenditure to the total duration by shaving down minutes off a few other songs, keep the intensity of  the first track, and that's really about it. It's not a step above there four previous albums and they aren't leaps above this. This one wont be a sleeper hit due to there fame at this point, but maybe when looked back at Muse's catalog one might spot this one with some of weakest moments.

It's not a step above there four previous albums and they aren't leaps above this. This one wont be a sleeper hit due to there fame at this point, but maybe when looked back at Muse's catalog one might spot this one with some of weakest moments.

Simple answer yes, the budget price is quite the deal and the deluxe edition is about that of standard CDs anyways. Those not familiar with Muse and would to get into them will also find it helpful that the band has had there work all reissued on vinyl! Final question probably looming from above is... Was it worth the wait? Yes, be glad Muse are back, be glad no hiatus came our way.reason I say not to worry so much about the continuity here of all places is, although they are all similarly named (\\"Exogenesis\\")... The three tracks tie in together by a quick fading out. grabbing a hold that fade and phasing it into the intro of the next track. They are all orchestral though, especially the second part \\"Cross-Pollination\\". It has a breakout moment and then shoots back down to a low volume resonating bow. The first Exogenesis \\"Overture\\" is just that, movie like, finds a stair climbing pace and walks with it indefinitely. The third and final Exogenesis is one of a supposed catharsis entitled \\"Redemption\\". Intro wise it sounds a bit mournful but seems to find the swinging light overhead, and ends on a brighter note piano slowing down, notes ringing a little bit longer growing a bit more sleepy and there you have reached the end.     So what did we get here with the long awaited new Muse album? You be the judge of that, I'll tell you what I got out of it.

0385504225|5.0|Robert Langdon is back, and he's on another fascinating case. This time, he's up against the ultra-secret Society of Freemasons, with enough cryptic clues and arcane historical facts to please everyone who loved the two previous Langdon stories. Of the three, this one just might be my favorite.    Dan Brown is really an amazing author. Very few writers can mix so much history, science, folklore, and sociology into a thrilling suspense story as successfully as he does. If you liked the first two Langdons, I don't have to tell you to read this one. If you haven't met Langdon yet, what are you waiting for? Highly recommended.
0385504225|5.0|Yep, Mr. Brown's newest book, THE LOST SYMBOL, is a very worthy addition to his bibliography. In \\"The Lost Symbol,\\" symbolist Robert Langdon is on a mission to find a Masonic pyramid containing a code that unlocks an ancient secret to \\"unfathomable power.\\" It's a story of hidden history in the nation's capitol, with Masons the greatest puzzle of all.<br /><br />The Freemasons date back to the Middle Ages, to associations of workmen who built cathedrals in Britain, though some also believe in a connection to ancient times with the mines where King Solomon took material for his Temple. Freemasonry has endured, and transformed. The British began to accept members who were not stonemasons and by the 1700s, lodges were being called \\"speculative,\\" philosophical societies rather than worker guilds.<br /><br />The book features small, easily readable chapters and is a classic Brown-style page-turner. Six years of research and an amazing passion for writing is apprent from the first page to the last.<br /><br />If you're a big Brown fan like me, you'll appreciate that I'm not going to divulge any spoilers to would-be readers. Check it out for yourself...you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Highly recommened!

With some books I need only read a page or two, with others the first couple of chapters. \\"Buy\\" and \\"don't buy\\" piles are made, money changes hands and I feel happy and excited about the adventures in store as I drive home.<br /><br />*sigh*  I love books...<br /><br />My point? If I'd never heard of Dan Brown and if The Lost Symbol had been one of those books I decided to take a closer look at, it would have gone into the \\"don't buy\\" pile.<br /><br />The use of \\"adorned\\" twice and \\"the skull cradled in his palms\\" three times in the 3 page prologue would have had me wincing a little and doubting the skill of both the writer and the editor. And I probably wouldn't have given it a chance.<br /><br />But I have heard of Brown and I read the DaVinci Code. While it didn't convince me that Brown was an amazing writer, it did convince me that he could tell an entertaining tale; one that engaged my mind and made me curious about historical events I was previously only vaguely aware of.

I managed to avoid letting that spoil my enjoyment.<br /><br />I know very little about the Freemasons and have never previously heard of the Invisible College. Certainly, I don't have the knowledge to know how much Brown twisted history and fudged facts in The Lost Symbol.

B002ELM5HY|5.0|I love this new album by Mark Knopfler. It is filled with many moods and sounds.  He is such a good musician and singer.  I love the bluesy sound of \\"You Can't Beat The House\\".  Mark shows off his talent playing the electric guitar on this song.  This is the kind of song that makes me feel like I am in a bar drinking and having fun.  I love the song \\"Get Lucky\\".  This song is about a person trying to make a living. This song has a light pleasant quality to it.  I love the sentimental tone of Before Gas and TV.  I love the joyous Celtic sound of \\"Border Revier\\". \\"Piper To The End\\" is a song that questions life after death.  This is a beautiful song.  \\"Cleaning My Gun\\" is a song about a solitary activity gives a person peace in a crazy world.  \\"So Far From The Clyde\\" is a song about a ship.  This song makes feel me feel peaceful but sad too.  I love this new album.
0143034901|5.0|This was a \\"book club\\" pick for me and I had trouble locating a copy at the library in time for our monthly meeting. I ordered the book and it arrived 3 days before the meeting.  I figured there would be no way I'd finish in time, but once I opened the front cover, I couldn't put it down!  I had the book finished in 36 hours- the story was immediately captivating.  Zafon creates the kind of story that appeals to anyone by incorporating humor, intrigue, romance, mystery, history, and literary skills that surpass most American authors.  The characters are richly drawn and lovable (or \\"hate-able\\" in some cases!) and the story is woven so tenderly and with such purpose that the reader almost feels like a part of the intricate web.  HIGHLY recommended- easily the best book I've read in years!!
0439023483|5.0|Once in awhile you come across a book that you just can't put down, you just have to finish it, and this is one of those books!  An action-packed but very layered and complex story about a young girl who is thrown into an arena where she is forced to face off with 24 other kids in a battle to the death.  Think gladiator but on a much larger scale where it seems the stage is actually a very vast land with mountains, valleys, rivers, etc.  Think Gladiator meets Survivor!<br /><br />In the ruins of what was once North America there are now 12 districts, ruled by one capital, Panem.  Most of these districts are in very sad states, they just scrape by when it comes to food and other luxuries.<br /><br />Every year, a boy and a girl are randomly chosen to compete in what the capital calls \\"The Hunger Games.\\"  There can only be one winner in these brutal games where participants are thrown into an arena to face-off not only against each other, but controlled elements that the Gamemasters throw into the game (soaring to plummeting temperatures, fires, lightning storms, etc.)  These games are televised to all of the districts and each participant becomes a bit of a celebrity, able to pick-up sponsors along the way that may or may not help them when the game becomes too much to handle in the arena.<br /><br />We follow Katniss, a girl from District 12, who volunteers for her 12 year old sister's place when she is the first girl chosen.  A person volunteering for another has never happened, and if it has, it has been very rare in these 74 years that the Hunger Games have been held.  Peeta, a baker's son, is the male counterpart chosen for the games.  Together, these two will need to eventually team together if one of them are able to even dream of making it out alive.<br /><br />This is an amazing story and a very quick read for those looking for quick entertainment.  I highly recommend.  Be sure to check out the sequel, \\"Catching Fire.\\"
0547258305|4.0|One of the things I liked most about this book was that it wasn't predictable at all; While reading I coud imagine what the main story was about and what could happen next but what happened to the characters themselves, was a totally diferent case.    There's the story main line (the cause of the story) and then, the interactions between the character, so while the love's part was well developed, it was left in the background. I must mention too that sex is mentioned in the book, but nothing explicit.    The pace is constant, maybe a bit fast or slow at some point, but mostly it was well paced and easy to read.    The characters were well developed as well. Katsa is a lonely girl who has lived apart from everybody because of her scaring \\"grace\\". She accepts what the others think about her and feels they have reason. But Katsa doesn't want to be a a monster, so when, thanks to Po, she finds a new meaning for her \\"grace\\" she starts feeling better about herself.     Po, in the other hand, seems to be very proud about his \\"grace\\", but he hides a secret about it that can't be revealed. He tries and tries to make Katsa see she isn't as bad as she thinks and that love isn't a chain that imprisons.    Overall: Graceling was a very enjoyable read. An adventurous story about morals, principes and love.
B002BSHWUU|4.0|(I have purchased the STEREO box set of the remastered Beatles' catalog of recrodings and am reviewing that set here. I have not heard the MONO box set and am not comparing it to the stereo set here.) Also, I'm reviewing the recordings themselves and not the packaging per se.    \\"Reviewing\\" these remastered recordings is hard to do since everyone, on account of their individual aural listening skills, tastes, and technical expertise, will react somewhat differently to these recordings. I suspect there is even some divergence of opinion over details, however slight, among the team of engineers at Abbey Road who did this remaster, though I have no reason to doubt the abilities and dedication of any of them.    For what it sets out to do--and this is what I mean by \\"ground-rules\\"--this set of recordings is an excellent end-product.    What these recordings offer in terms of sonic results:    1. You can hear EVERYTHING and you can hear it CLEARLY.  2. The soundscape is very clean and noise-free.  3. The vocals, instruments (and especially the percussion sounds and Paul's bass guitar) seem clean, detailed, nuanced, and true-to-life in unsurpassed ways.  4. If I had to choose a few adjectives to describe the sound overall I would say the recordings are \\"unvarnished,\\" \\"acoustically correct,\\" and \\"accurate.\\"  5. All four Beatles' vocals sound true to their well-known voices, both generally and in all the details.  6. The conversion from analog to digital has been well done, and while I can hear the difference from original vinyl issues, the sound is not COLD, although the amount of realism in all the sonic aspects does make this remaster sound a bit \\"clinical,\\" though in a good sense of that word. (I've heard prior Beatles recording issues sound more rip-roaringly energetic at times, but not more true-to-life.)    It seems to me that recording engineers have a tough job, because a big part of what they have to do (and do right) is technical; instruments and voices must sound realistic (if that is indeed the goal, which it is not always--e.g., John Lennon's vocal on TOMORROW NEVER KNOWS, which was originally processed/re-recorded through a Leslie speaker) when first recorded, when processed later, and when mixed with other elements of the track. But another equally vital aspect of what recording engineers (and record producers) have to do, and upon which there is probably much greater divergence of opinion, is the ARTISTIC shaping of a recording. Sonic 'realism' is NOT always the only goal when making a recording, although it is usually the starting point. My own feeling is that remixing is a whole discussion unto itself, as is stereo vs. mono (and not just with respect to The Beatles, but with all music that straddles the mono/stereo transition period). Personally, I have no problem enjoying these stereo remasters, just because they are in stereo, any less than I can enjoy monoaural counterparts, though I am well aware of John Lennon's preference for monaural Beatle end-product (from one of his interviews). My reason for liking stereo is because it gives a better sense of 3-D, which is the world around us and the world in which The Beatles lived and performed. (LIkewise, I welcome 5.1 mixes for their dimensional realism as well.) And so I have no particular quibble with stereo vs. mono, and am happy that listeners do have the choice to purchase either the (mostly) stereo vs. the (mosty) mono set. For those who can afford it, both can be purchased and enjoyed for what they are.    The issue of the wide separation of vocals vs. instruments in the stereo set is a question better resolved by addressing the issue of remixing, I think, something this remastering project did not set out to do. My own preference in this area arises from listening to the LOVE soundtrack, which I feel generally has an edge over this remastered set, in that it attempts to do something DIFFERENT than simply re-master the catalog en masse: there is an ineffable warmth and liveliness to the LOVE recordings that mere (but excellent) remastering alone cannot accomplish. Here I have no blame to lay upon the engineers who remastered this new stereo set, but rather a wish for the additional sort of touch that George and Giles Martin might have brought to this project had they been (able to) have been involved as well. It's the difference between technical excellence--which this set has in spades--and technical excellence in the service of the interrelated and more subjective art of remixing.    What I find myself wishing for the Beatles recordings is two things:    1. Pure Beatles sound; faithful reproduction of their performances--which this set does very well  2. Artful blending of all the elements in a way that captures the artists, their time, and the world they wrote about.    It is in this second area that I feel there is still work to be done with The Beatles' catalog, though again I cannot fault the engineers who laid down certain ground rules for the kinds of processing these recordings would receive (their choices were sensible ones). But my sense is that there is still a little something missing here, and it is definitely in the 'arty' area of record production.    Being an informed amateur when it comes to recording/engineering techniques, I don't mind the amount of limiting applied to these recordings, though I would not want any more than has already been added. Unlike some others, I don't hear clipped volume levels that are then 'unclipped' by turning down the overall volume; the engineers have been more careful than that.    All in all, this set is a NICE way to experience The Beatles' catalog, and it attains its own objectives based on the ground-rules set out by the engineers beforehand. I give the set four stars rather than five because, as the LOVE soundtrack demonstrates, there is still additional 'magic' to be had from this music with the addition of some careful and appropriate re-mixing of the sort that Giles and George Martin were able to do.    P.S.--As a music educator (Piano) I often use Beatles recordings to teach keyboard students pop harmony by having them play chordal accompaniments along with the records. In the past I've had them purchase either the Red & Blue compilations or the \\"1\\" compilation album for practice, etc. The only problem with using those recordings for this purpose in the past has been that about 1/3 of the tracks are somewhat out-of-tune with A440 (a quarter tone or less, either sharp or flat) and so we've had to detune our electronic Piano beforehand to match, etc. Well, I checked today and MOST of the out of tune recordings are now BACK IN TUNE on these remasters! There are only a few song recordings still off pitch (e.g., HERE COMES THE SUN and STRAWBERRY FIELDS FOREVER) and I'd guess t that's due to track-bouncing and/or machine swapping done somewhere in the original recording process, but am not sure. Anyway, I'm DELIGHTED to have proper pitch restored to a number of the formerly out-of-tune songs.

Glad to hear that there will be a movie.  Having the entire series really helped me to follow the plot lines better, and had my annoyance confirmed at how crappy Todd, a noble beast so to speak, was treated. He could have dumped on Atlantis and its personnel many times over.  Looking forward to the movie indeed!

I was fully prepared for another dull historical mystery.  This book keeps you engaged throughout.  It is scary, heartfelt, humorous, historical, witty and yes even has romance.  How can a book have all these elements?  Read it and find out.  You won't be sorry.

B001F2W4Y2|2.0|Other reviewers are right. Brian's grizzly growly voice sounds awesome with the low notes, but this album is so extremely mediocre and forgettable. There are sparks here and there with the riffs but it never takes off.  Its better than Stiff Upper Lip but not as good as Ball Breaker or Razor's Edge. Best Song on the Album by faaaaaaaaar is Spoilin For A Fight, which is like a punch in the face in a good way. Stormy May Day is very cool because the Young brothers use a slide on the guitar. There is a hint yearning to experiment with the different riffing but it always reverts to the boring formula and not in a good way.Listen to the ending of Stormy May Day, they really have potential to experiment with a bluesy hard rocking music but I think are scared to really go for it. As far as Hard Rock, these guys take the cake and have damn well earned it by a long shot. Their live act is still the best and I hope their next album is better. I just hope it doesnt take 10 years.

B0025KVLU6|5.0|The Beatles remastered \\"White Album\\" is amazing for the clarity of the songs. It was originally released in 1968 after the Beatles return from their visit with Maharishi Mahesh Yogin in India. Surprisingly though nothing sounds very Indian here, unlike some of their other recordings on \\"Sgt Pepper\\" and \\"Revolver\\", where the distinctive use of the sitar could be heard. This album of eclectic tunes reads as something of a kaleidoscope of western music, from rock (Back in the USSR), classical chamber music (Piggies), 1930's dance hall tunes (Honey Pie), to the avant-garde (Revolution 9). This album takes us from the juggernaut energy of tunes like \\"Back in the USSR\\", \\"Happy Birthday\\", \\"Helter Skelter\\", and \\"Savoy Truffle\\" to the sprightly \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\\", to a quietly acoustic tune like \\"Blackbird\\". Even after all of these years this album continues to surprise and delight.<br /><br />The only problem I have with this collection is with the packaging of the CDs which are difficult to remove or insert in the cardboard holders (it seems they would also be prone to scratching the CDs), and I wish that there had been more historical liner notes.
0375423966|5.0|I like both volumes, but I see them as quite different. The first, her childhood in Iran, is extremely useful as a history book, telling of what went on in Iran during the author's childhood.  The second volume is less historical and more autobiographical, and of real interest as a memoir - the trials and tribulations of an adolescent / young adult whose life is very much complicated by Iran and by exile. This means talk about sex, drugs, friendships and human dealings good and bad, as well as relating to her own parents. It is of less interest on the subject of Iran, just as the first book of the two is of less interest, at least to me, as a memoir.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|There has been so much discussion over the last 40 years and recently on these pages as to which mixes (Mono or Stereo) are the most historically important, which versions did the Beatles spend most time on and crucially which sound better.  There is no doubt that George Martin and the Abbey Road engineers spent more time on the Mono mixes as that was the way most people would hear the records due to AM radio and cheap single speaker turntables. Stereo until 1968 was seen as a niche format for a hardcore of hi-fi enthusiasts.  As to which are most historically important, IMO they both are. Every album apart from Please Please Me was released the same day in mono and stereo (PPM was a month later) and according to EMI session documentation the same people responsible for the monos did the stereo. As to which sessions the Beatles attended that can't be determined for certain. There is no doubt from Revolver onwards they did take more of an interest in the mixing process but that is 4 years after they first entered Abbey Road, it would have been very difficult for the Beatles to attend mixing sessions pre 66 due to touring and other commitments.  As to which sound better, well that is subjective, some albums sound better in Mono some better in Stereo, some albums like Help it can be down to individual tracks. For certain both versions are fun to listen to, sound completely different and discovering the mix variations are one of the joys of being a Beatles fan. In the simplest possible terms mono is all about impact and depth where as with stereo it's about width, soundstage and space between the instruments.    On then to the Beatles in Mono.... So what actually is included. Well contrary to a few reviews EVERYTHING that has a dedicated mono mix is in there, including the original stereo mixes of Help and Rubber Soul and the never released Yellow Submarine EP which has true mono mixes of It's all Too Much, Hey Bulldog, All Together Now, Only a Northern Song and Acrossthe Universe. What you won't find is Yellow Submarine (Mono version was a fold-down of the stereo), Abbey Road and Let it Be and the singles from Ballad of John and Yoko onwards as they were Stereo only. Help, Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sgt Pepper and the White Album make their CD debut's in mono.  I must say from an aesthetic point of view this really is a Beatles fans dream. Every album resembles their UK first press vinyl counterpart to the finest detail with the exception of Magical Mystery Tour which was a US only LP in 1967. The quality of the cardboard, the artwork, inner sleeves and extra's are first class. Anyone who has previously bought Japanese manufactured collectable pieces will know what I'm talking about. There is the reason for the price difference between the mono and the stereo boxes, the build quality and the quality of materials used to compile the mono box far exceeds the stereo.  As for the sound, we have good news here as well. A victim of the loudness wars these are not, as the original press release stated there has been no noise reduction, compression or limiting used in the remastering process. The transfers are first rate and EQ has been used very sparingly, if at all in some cases and there is certainly more bass than on the vinyl as in most cases this was reduced at the cutting stage on the original LP's. It is great to hear these without the surface noise of my original LP's and the groove distortion as the needle tracks closer to the label on the inner most tracks. Are they better than the vinyl over all? Well I have a combination of 1st press UK vinyl and Japanese Red wax editions from 1982 and they are as detailed as the JPN vinyl but lack a bit of the warmth of the UK vinyl. No fault of the remastering, it is just difficult to achieve when tube gear was used at every stage of the mastering and cutting stage for the 1st press vinyl which adds a lot of natural warmth. Overall these are the best digital versions of the mono releases andit is difficult to see how they could be improved.    So are they worth the money? Well there in lies the question only you as a consumer can answer. I spent 2 days listening to these albums that I have listened to thousands of times over the years and had 2 of the best days I have ever spent as a music fan. One thing I will say is that the Mono mixes are best heard the good old fashioned way with 2 speakers and an amp, crank it up and fill your room with sound. You just do not get the same experience from headphones.  Could this whole remaster campaign have been done differently and cheaper? A lot of reviews on here show people have strong feelings about this if their anger is misdirected somewhat. Poor EMI bear the brunt when in actual fact they can't release ANYTHING by the Beatles without Apple signing off on it. It was Apples decision to retain the 87 remixes of Help and Rubber Soul on the individual releases, we have the Abbey Road engineers to thank for the original Stereo mixes being on the Mono set as a bonus. It would have made sense to have the mono and stereo on the same disc for the individual releases there by having more people exposed to the mono mixes, although how they would have sold a 4 disc White Album is beyond me. As the 4 main shareholders of Apple are Paul, Ringo, Yoko and Olivia we have to take it that this is the way they wanted them released, they have every right to release these as they see fit, they are the artists.    One thing is for certain, they will cost you a hell of a lot less than it will to collect these on vinyl and as it has often been quoted \\"You haven't heard Sgt Pepper till you have heard it in Mono\\" never a truer word said.
B001GCUO16|2.0|For the origin of the character Wolverine, you would probably expect a film that goes deep into who he was, what his life was like, etc. No, not here. The film is an hour and a half, so you can imagine how bad the pacing was. Everything happens so quickly that the characters and the story have no room to breath. It's just bad writing. You really don't connect well with any of the characters and you hardly care about them because there is no damn character development. They focused more on the action and things blowing up than they did with the actual characters.    It's hardly an origins story. It's basically everything we already know plus some crap about him trying to find out stuff that really adds nothing to the story. The end is pretty predictable and probably the only scene you need to watch if you've seen the other X-Men films. Overall, it's somewhat entertaining but the title is very misleading. They should have just called it \\"Same old Wolverine\\" or something along those lines, because the most we learn about him happens within 5 to 10 minutes of the film. The rest is just dull action. I hope they develop a better story with the next film. That's Hollywood blockbusters for you though huh?
B002BSHWUU|5.0|If you, like me, were scared by some of the negative reviews of The Beatles in stereo, you need not be worried.  Everyone has their idea of what The Beatles sound like (or what they SHOULD sound like).  One could debate for eternity what COULD have been done with the process of remastering (and some would add remixing) of these masterpieces.  But to me, it's simple.  I am hearing things I never have heard before on these tracks.  The clarity is incredible!  As Sir Paul says, it's like hearing John right in the room with you.  One reviewer even said this was not an improvement on the 1987 CD releases!!  I have no idea what he is listening on, maybe an old boom-box from his basement.<br /><br />I knew immediately that this would be a controversial set.  It is quite different from any Beatles CDs you've heard before.  But that's the truly amazing part.  Even now, in a new century, we can still be rediscovering these songs.  And I've heard the mono mix as well (have the set).  I actually prefer the stereo, except for the mono mix of Twist and Shout, Helter Skelter and Sgt. Pepper's (all of it).  For some reason Pepper's is just too different of an experience on the stereo remaster.  But all this is minor compared to the joy in getting to hear The Beatles reinvented yet again.  If you can't imagine that you'll want to experience that, don't pay for the ticket, this ride's not for you.  Let the audiofiles nitpick about what they want these CDs to sound like.  But for the vast majority of the public, this is The Beatles for a new time.<br /><br />Don't be put off by the negative reviews.  One guy even said he was going to return his set unopened he was so upset by the reviews.  You're missing out dude!  The talent involved in this project knew exactly what they were doing.  Thanks Paul and Ringo!!!
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|This is a pretty good film. It prompted me to research the Satanic influence on rock and roll and boy did I find a lot. I stumbled upon a documentary on youtube entitled, \\"They Sold Their Souls to Rock\\".  Unlike musicians who have to follow the ways of Satanist Aliester Crowley, et al. to gain talent and fame, Ralph Macchio's character has natural talent.  I figured that if Satan is into music, he must also be into politics and foreign relations and boy did I find the Secret Societies and the New World Order. Satan has power to temp and to deceive people. In fact, God allows him temporary dominion over the world. He even tempted Jesus, \\"All this I will give you,\\" he said, \\"if you will bow down and worship me.\\". Matt. 4:9. However, like Robert Johnson and the many who sold their souls for temporary wealth, fame or power, they find out too late that the bargain is unconscionable. \\"For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?\\" Mark 8:36. In contrast, Jesus promises us the real bargain, He says, \\"Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.\\" Matthew 10:39. Unlike Satan's empty promises, Jesus has already proved his by dying on the cross, paying for our sins and rising to live again.
B001LF347E|5.0|I hope NBC picks up season 2 of this fantastic show and also that it becomes available on DVD in the US. I've caught almost every episode on tv so what I have missed I watched on line, thank God for the internet. The show, actors, staging, sets and stories...it truly is the best.
B002NXPTDK|5.0|I picked this album up on a whim because of its $3.99 first day release price, and I was pleasantly surprised.  I'm not a fan of main stream hip hop, more the alternative stuff (the Roots, Talib Kweli, Common, etc.) but the production and overall story concept of this album was pretty interesting.  The beats are sparse with a lot of spacey sounds but a lot of them are really catchy (hear \\"Alive\\"), and the interludes with Common are interesting because they narrate the story of a stoner, and all the songs fit into different acts within the album.  This is the first hip hop album in a long time that is more enjoyable when you listen to the whole album in entirety, it's a steal at $3.99.
B002GZQY6Q|5.0|As far as I am concerned as a long time listener of anything music, regardless of genres and source, there is no bigger name in music than Steven Wilson. And I mean it with no hesitation or reservations. The sooner you realize this, the better off you are as a listener and would be rewarded with the most wonderful, original and most refreshing music that is out of this planet! The Incident is nothing short of that. The concept album is a surreal journey of series of events that change your life forever. I loved the album beginning to end and I was like at the edge of my seat while listening to this gem! It is like a great movie with alive vivid visuals directed and produced by yourself in your mind while you are listening it! Don't let this awesome work of art pass you by. Because if you do, then sooner or later you would regret that you did not discover this earlier enough! Porcupine Tree, Blackfield, No-man, I.E.M., Steven Wilson's Solo projects all are masterpieces. However, they all require one thing, you to be a patient and attentive listener! If you are then, look no further, get ready for the sweetest ride of your life! Don't miss it...................!
B002GZQYMK|2.0|This is the third time that I listen to this album and I still can't believe it's Muse. Yes, some of the songs (Uprising, Unnatural selection) are a bit catchy but by the rest of the album it seems that Muse decided to put creativity to rest! With obvious borrowings from Marilyn Manson, Queen and an electro-pop sound of the late 80s, this album couldn't be more cheesy. And that Samson and Delilah and Chopin samples did not work either!    I used to love Muse for their passion, creativity and fury, but none of that can be seen in this album. This will sell millions just because it came after the awesome \\"Black holes\\", but wouldn't have given them any attention if it would have come out at the beginning of their career. Many fans warned that Muse was selling out with \\"Black holes\\" and it didn't look like that to me, but it does now. What a shame.    If you want to listen to the real Muse, get \\"Black holes\\", \\"Origin of symmetry\\", \\"Absolution\\" or \\"Hullabaloo\\", not this lame excuse for an album.    How can any true Muse fan like a song like \\"Undisclosed desires\\"? It sounds like if it was produced by Timbaland.
B002A4Q652|2.0|This is pop music masquerading as symphonic metal.  Many songs such as the opener will start out with a crunching heavy metal riff and then transition into a straight up pop song with a verse/chorus/verse structure and an occasional breakdown.  The drums are annoying and I suspect an electronic kit was used.  It is hard to tell if the vocalist has true talent because there are so many layers of singing at all times.  Overall, the CD sounds overproduced.  Listeners new to the genre should check out Nightwish or After Forever before moving on to Delain.  The highlight of the album is the guest appearance of Marco Hietala (Nightwish, Tarot)with vocals on 2 songs.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|Welcome back Dave.     If you are a Megadeth fan, and you ever trusted a review, trust this one. This is the heaviest and most p***-off album in Dave's career.     If this is what a mid-life crisis does for your testosterone level, then I'm looking foreward to mine. It starts out with a short, instrumental rave-up, guitar leads flying at top speed, and then charges straight into \\"This day we fight\\". A Fast to mid-tempo smoker. \\"Bite the hand\\" track 5 is absolutely vicious, as is \\"Headcrusher\\", a kind-of a sequel to \\"Skin of my Teeth\\". This album does something that neither Megadeth, or too many others have been able to accomplish lately, every song has a nasty bite to it, but the songwriting is there.     It sounds exectly like vintage thrash Megadeth, only heavier, via beefed-up modern production. It's funny, but I never really thought of Megadeth as a thrash band. Their music was never really that fast, no \\"polka beats\\" as it were, and stylistically closer to Iron Maiden than Slayer, which was ok by me, but on Endgame, to me, they really sound like a thrash band...and one that will take some time to catch. If this is a trend for the band, getting heavier with age, I can't wait until he's 60. Oh heck, nevermind, that would make me....
B0000CEB4V|5.0|fantastic, extraordinary, remarkable, outstanding, brilliant is the way I describe this concert from the beginning to the end.
B000RLCJ5Q|5.0|This is an excellent CD of Clash Classics at their best. This is probably one of the \\"Greatest\\" compilation CD's ever. You get all their best songs, all on one CD. The Clash has been called the best \\"Punk Rock\\" band ever. They are inductees into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, in Cleveland, Ohio. Plus, the last time I was at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, there was an excellent exhibit of the Clash, there.    You get the various line-ups of:    Joe Strummer (the late/great leadman of the Clash) - Lead Vocals & Guitar  Mick Jones - Guitar & Vocals  Paul Simonon - Bass  Tory Crimes (Terry Chimes) - Original Drummer  Topper Headon - Drummer    There were some personnel changes through the years, but their music style, & songs retained the same sounds, and themes. They were a very, very entergetic, & very \\"aggressive\\" band, and were known for \\"Power-Punk\\" Songs, and \\"Songs With an Attitude\\". The \\"classic\\" songs on this CD, represent these descriptions. These songs represent the Clash at their best!!!!    The songs are as follows:     1.London Calling  2.Rock the Casbah  3.Should I stay or Should I go  4.I Fought the Law  5.(White Man) in Hammersmith Palais  6.The Magnificent Seven  7.Bankrobber  8.The Call up  9.Complete Control  10.White Roit  11.Remote Control  12.Tommy Gun  13.Clash City Rockers  14.English Civil War (Johnny Comes Marching Home)  15.Hitsville, UK  16.Know Your Rights  17.This is England  18.This is Radio Clash    Bonus Tracks:  19.Train in Vain (Stand by Me)  20.Groovy Times    Overall, this is an excellent cd, and a \\"must-have\\" for any \\"punk-rock\\", or any \\"Clash\\" fan, or any \\"rock\\" fan. This is truly an excellent compilation CD at its best. Thanks!!!!
B002FOQXZK|5.0|Kid Cudi embodies a new element of hip hop that is much needed, especially in this time and day.  Cudi is not afraid to rap about consciousness or delve into the rampant imaginings of an altered state of mind.  His amazing production also makes one who listens to him really believe he is a man on the moon...roaming and searching in a new dimension of hip hop.
B002ELM5HY|4.0|As an American citizen with a Scottish ancestry, I can definitely appreciate the music in this CD. Mark is from Scotland, and his band has that Celtic, Scottish, style, which goes along great, with Mark's great Guitar, Rock & Roll style. Key tracks include: \\"Border Reiver\\", \\"Cleaning My Gun\\", and \\"Piper to the End\\". The rest of the songs are very good also. Thanks!!!
0896898288|3.0|I received this book yesterday after much anticipation and it is not what I expected. Unlike the Civil War quilt book, the patterns are not diagrammed full size and there are no measurements so it is impossible to make the blocks unless you get the templates from the CD.  However, as yet I have not had any luck getting the CD to load. I cannot find any instructions on using the CD anywhere in the book. Also the paper used for the pages is not good quality in my opinion.  That being said, this is a beautiful quilt and the letters are wonderful to read. I would still like to make this quilt but unless I can figure out how to load the CD, I will have to redraft every block! If anybody has any suggestions, please let me know.    Added 10-19-09  The CD is fine now thanks to suggestions from many people. It is not a program but just a file of the templates, one per page. Most of the blocks are very easy to redraft and that is what I am doing as I make the blocks. This is really a beautiful quilt and book. I do wish there was a file to print out ALL the templates on a few pages as this would save lots of paper. I also would have prefered the CD to include the full size diagrams of each block. That being said I would still highly recommend this book to any quilter.
1595141715|4.0|Although the main premise of \\"Thirteen Reasons Why\\" is a little dark, the layout of this book was phenomenal. I literally finished it in a matter of hours, and was drawn in by the dialogue between the tapes Hannah had left behind and Clay's thoughts. You would never want to end up being one of the thirteen people mentioned on those tapes, and as a result, it causes you to rethink every interaction with those around you.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I eagerly anticipated receiving the mono set and was not disappointed. There are some essential elements to enjoying a good recording. Clarity, balance, immediacy and spaciousness. The mono recordings generally have the first three in spades. Only spaciousness clearly goes into the stereo set's column. Clarity is really good on both the stereo and mono releases. The real advantages of mono are to be found in the balance and immediacy to be heard. There is no right/left separation to worry about here. The immediacy can be heard in the rhythm section (especially true on Revolver and Sgt. Pepper). As a side note, the stereo White Album is rather good. It is in 1968 where stereo started to get more attention and eight tracks made their debut in the studio.
B000GX57YK|5.0|This is a great action movie, even better than the original IMHO. I had seen this before on regular DVD but decided to purchase the HD-DVD version. It is a heist film - stealing gold from some double-crossing folks in the past, then a double cross by one of the robbers in the group. Getting the gold back is the highlight of the movie. The boat chase scene in Venice is great - did you know they had to get special permission to do it and I'd imagine the the folks in Venice will never let that happen again due to the amount of wake created during filming (ever seen a powerboat in the waterways of Venice? The wakes cause damage to the structures).<br /><br />Great deal of action sequences, great sound - all made better in HD. If you want to see an excellent action film, with good vs. evil elements, and a great car chase - get this flick. You won't be disappointed.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|One of the best if not the best music collection I own. Great quality!. Do your self a favor and buy one!
1401219268|5.0|It cannot be stated enough how much of a work of art this set is.  I have read comics forever, but rarely deviated from my X-Men/Marvel reading list.  After the \\"Watchmen\\" movie came out I decided to check the original out, and I am so glad I did.  Though set in the 80's, there is no era that can contain the incredible writing of Moore nor the stylistic and detailed art of Gibbons.  On nearly every page there is an illustration, a sentence, or a combination of both that makes your jaw drop.  I just completed my second read through and I am ready for number three already.  More than a comic, more than a \\"graphic novel\\", \\"Watchmen\\" is social commentary that breaks barriers and will leave you pondering humanity, for better or for worse.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|I was 6 years old in 1964 when Beatlemania hit the states.  I have loved and been a collector of their music ever since. The Beatles music speaks for itself.  Many already know the songs so there is no need to rate the music here.  What most people are interested in is if this new remastering is worth purchasing and/or replacing their old CD's for.  Yes!!! A Big Huge Yes!!!  Despite what some are saying, the quality of the sound is significant.  I feel like I'm hearing the Beatles new all over again!  The earlier albums are especially obvious because they were originally recorded in mono.  I liked the packaging and the little Quicktime videos were interesting and fun.  As for Abbey Road itself?  The quality is outstanding like the rest. However, I have one complaint...Paul's bass guitar is really heavy here (as it is in all the recordings).  But this is a small complaint in relationship to the over-all sound quality and can easily be remedied with adjustments on your EQ. People who are nit-picking about this and that to me wouldn't be satisfied with anything anyway...they just like to complain.  Believe me...these re-masters are well worth the investment!
B0013ND30W|5.0|I've seen \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" more than 100 times since it first came out on VHS. I thought it was beautiful then.  But when I first saw the newly re-masterd BluRay edition. I've never notice how beautiful the movie is. To be honest \\"Snow White\\" and \\"Cinderella\\" is a better movie. But \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" is my personal favorite. It's has the most attractive animation even to this day. I own the VHS, Laserdisc, DVD and now the Bluray. But the BluRay is the best format that I've seen so far. It's like seeing the movie for the first time. The picture is so crisp. You can now really see the detailing of the background. It's amazing and it's mesmorizing to watch.
B002GZQYMK|4.0|Muse just barely disappointed me with Black Holes and Revelations, an album critically acclaimed to be their crowning achievement that I found slightly uneven.  I've never thought twice about naming Absolution as my favorite album by the band, and as a follow-up, Black Holes just seemed to be lacking the same focus and drive.  This left room for The Resistance to come in and reclaim what I felt they had lost.  In a way, it does.  Resistance takes the best moments from each album and tries to put its own unique spin on them.  The result is far more hit and miss than Black Holes could have ever dreamt of being, yet still a somewhat rewarding experience for any Muse fan.<br /><br />What Muse does exceedingly well on The Resistance is the same thing they've always done;  craft loud, smart, beautigul rock music.  \\"Uprising\\" feels like a Muse take on a Marilyn Manson song - at least initially.  By the time the third chorus rolls around, you'll most likely be rocking out to the harmonies and Muse-peggios that you've grown accustomed to over the years.  As far as pure, unadulterated rock goes though, you'd be hard-pressed to find anything on this album more satisfying than \\"United States of Eurasia.\\"  The song is so pretty, yet so raw and real that you'll think you were listening to Queen.  When Matt screams out, \\"United States!  United States!\\" I get goosebumps at the sheer awesomeness of it all.  This is classic Muse; something that any long-time fan can instantly fall in love with.<br /><br />But as I said, The Resistance is a highly uneven listen, and where songs like \\"Eurasia\\" will rock your junk clean off, others like \\"Guiding Light\\" fall absolutely flat.  It's this album's \\"Invincible\\" - really good until you start to see all the flaws in it.  \\"Undisclosed Desires\\" is Muse's completely misguided attempt at making a Britney Spears song, which may pander to the \\"Twilight\\" crowd (I can't even begin to tell you how much it annoys me when people describe \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\" as \\"that song from Twilight), but it has absolutely no place on this album!  In all fairness, it seems like they're trying to recreate that same song right down to the lyrical content.  But where \\"Supermassive\\" had an irresistible rock groove to it, this one is simply boring.  As far as the poppier Muse is concerned, I'll be just fine with \\"I Belong to You,\\" easily one of the album's finest tracks.  It's got a danceable beat and an infectious feel.  The French interlude is strikingly beautiful, and when everything comes back together again, well, it's just magic!<br /><br />A review of The Resistance wouldn't be complete without mentioning the 3-part \\"symphony\\" that closes out the album.  \\"Exogenesis\\" is straight from the Absolution-era of Muse, and for that reason, I can't help but love it!  \\"Overture\\" sounds like a roided-out version of \\"Ruled by Secrecy,\\" the eerie closer to the band's 2003 masterpiece, \\"Cross-Pollination\\" is straight out of \\"Butterflies and Hurricanes,\\" while \\"Redemption\\" sort of just stands on its own merits.  As great as these songs are though, they feel entirely tacked-on to the album, which takes away from their greatness a bit.<br /><br />The biggest flaw of The Resistance in my opinion is the lyrical content.  Matt Bellamy has seemed compelled to write socio-political songs as of late, so seeing it appear all over the album is no big surprise.  But Muse's music alone has always made me want to go take on the whole world.  Writing a song about how we need to rebel against the powers that be and \\"watch our flag ascend\\" just seems like a dumbing-down of the music.  Popular music has always been an outlet for speaking out against governments and \\"fat cats,\\" but Dylan did it much better in the 60s.  Bellamy's lyrics come off as a Saturday-morning cartoons version of the same thing.<br /><br />Still, there's a lot to like about The Resistance.  There are some fantastic songs on this album, and if you can get over the 3 or 4 dud tracks and the sometimes-silly lyrical content (\\"Love is our resistance?\\"  Dear  god, really?!?), you'll find that it is an entirely worthy album to add to your collection.  Yes, Muse is officially an \\"arena\\" band, but they're endlessly more talented than any of the other bands occupying the sub-genre.  Take solace in that, and in knowing that in the last 10 years they have yet to let any of us down entirely.<br /><br />Key Tracks:<br />1. \\"Uprising\\"<br />2. \\"Resistance\\"<br />3. \\"United States of Eurasia\\"<br />4. \\"I Belong to You\\"<br />5. \\"Exogenesis: Symphony Pt. 1:  Overture\\"<br /><br />7 out of 10 Stars(\\"Love is our resistance?\\"  Dear  god, really?!?), you'll find that it is an entirely worthy album to add to your collection.

B00005JPS8|5.0|i am a huge fan of marvel movies. especially the x-men series. i got this for my dad for his birthday and im pretty sure it is now his favorite movie. my 5-year-old little brother, the biggest ghostbusters fan ever,  loves it too! this movie starts out in afghanistan, where tony stark (robert downey JR.) is displaying the latest stark industries weapon, the Jericho missile. on the way back to the military base, his humvee is attacked by a minor terrorist group called the ten rings. they capture him and give him three months to build the Jericho missile for them. while it looks like he is building the Jericho, he is really building a suit that he calls the \\"MARK 1\\".  he escapes, but his companion, yensi, is killed. his best friend, James \\"rhodey\\" rhodes, finds him walking around in the desert and returns him to america. he then closes down the weapons manufacturing power plant of stark industries. well thats all i can tell you you'll just have to see it yourself
B00012FXB8|5.0|This is by far my favorite alien movie because it's the complete antithesis to Aliens.    Sure, the action sequences are nothing like before, but think about it:  If Hicks and Newt actually survived, watching Alien 3 would've been like watching part two of Aliens, which is why their deaths made sense since Ripley, in my opinion, was meant to suffer a tragic existence since encountering the first alien.    As for the product itself, it's a digipak (one annoying drawback).    During the playback of the Assembly Cut of Alien 3 [on Disc 5], there is a slight jump between 1:13:44 and 1:13:45 for whatever reason, but the DVD itself never shut down or skipped to the point where there was no audio or video.    There are a bevy of special features I have yet to watch, but I'm sure Disc Two will be fine.    Pick this up, especially since The Assembly Cut seams together 30 minutes of additional footage that was edited out by the studio after numerous test audiences.  This footage makes for a better movie, with gorier death scenes, an alternate opening and a new sequence which brings the alien into existence.    Well worth the money.
0618918248|5.0|I just finished reading, for the second time, The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins. It is an awesome book with many great points. Don't be put off by the title of the book, that's not really the main point (it is a point, don't get me wrong). The real main point of the book is to get people to think. To evaluate evidence, to think logically, and to not blindly believe in something just because you were told to believe in it. The book does a fantastic job at showing not only why the odds of a god existing are so incredibly small as to be negligible, why people may believe in a god (an idea with a Darwinian explanation), how we can be moral in the absence of religion (and to show that morality really doesn't come from religion at all), but also why we should not be forced to tip toe around religion.     Another great point, among the many great points, that I think Dawkins makes in the book is that we should not force children to be a certain religion, for children are not old enough to choose for themselves. As Dawkins puts it, there is no such thing as a Christian child, Muslim child, Buddhist child, etc, but a child of Christian parents, a child of Muslim parents, and children of Buddhist parents. Just as we (or I would hope most of us) would never say that there exists a Republican child, Democrat child, or a Marxists child, we should not say a child is a part of a particular faith. Children are too young to evaluate the evidence and decide for themselves.    The God Delusion is not just a book for people who are already atheists, though I am sure atheists like myself are in the majority of those who read the book. The book is good for everyone, whether they be atheists, agnostics, spiritual or religious. The book opens your eyes to the world, it makes you think logically, rationally and scientifically. It shows you that you should evaluate the evidence before believing in something. Believing in something blindly, without real evidence, or without asking yourselfif the evidence provided is flawed (or just plain wrong), is a disgrace to being human. It's a disgrace because we have the ability to look at the world objectively, but many of us close our eyes to it, and believe whatever we are told. It is rather sad how many people do not even look for evidence before they believe in something.    I advise everyone to read this book with an open mind (and no, not so open that you blindly believe everything Dawkins says). I am not saying you have to agree with what Dawkins writes, but just open the book, and start reading. If you're atheist or agnostic, read the book. If you're on the fence about whether or not you believe in god, read the book. And if you're very religious, what harm can reading the book do? So you should read the book too.
0385504225|1.0|Dan Brown has done it once again.  He's used a thriller to promote his religious ideas, specifically the New Age religion.  The Lost Symbol ends by concluding that God does not exist, that man created Him.  Dan Brown states categorically with no room for debate that man can become god and actually is god.      Truly after the plethora of historical inaccuracies and the liberty taken with art history in the Da Vinci Code combined with his attacks the person of Christ, could we have expected anything less for him now?  He has not changed his stripes.    There is a reason Brown kept the plot of this novel in the dark for so long.  He did not want knowledge of its content to harm sales.  He is attempting to kill God, but of course, that is impossible.  He is to be pitied.
0920668372|5.0|This is a wonderful book. My mother used to read this to me when I was a child and now I read it to my daughter at night. It is a wonderful story of a mothers love for her child. I can not get through the book with out crying. I would recommend this book to everyone. This book teaches the lesson to love one another and hang on to this love as long as you can. My mother has breast cancer and I think this book draws on the fact that we need to take the time to love our family while we have the chance. This is not too heavy of a topic for children to grasp. Life constantly changes and death is not the only thing that gets in the way of family. Regardless of the reason we should take the time to love our family and make sure they know it. The world needs more mothers and children saying \\" I'll love you forever.\\"

SO had everything - deeper lyrics & content and still provided those GB riffs we all love. Plus 17 high quality tracks. I was happy when SR was over. The first thing I thought while listening was Clash wanna be's. It just doesn't work here. I'm sure Joe Strummer is rolling over in his grave. Stick with \\"kick ass\\" Riffs from GB & SO. PLEASE try and make #4 a progression from Shine On. Forget about the punk side you are showing with Shaka Rock. Regardless it will have to be a step in the right direction after Shaka rock.

0439023491|5.0|Wow! I LOVED The Hunger Games, after reading it on the recommendation of a friend. I'm 27, and am always looking for great books to read, especially ones free of sex and bad language, and this fit the bill without disappointing in the action. I couldn't put either book down until I finished. Catching Fire was absoloutely amazing, engrossing, and just plain brilliant. I recommend it a million times over to anyone looking for a well written, detailed and very imaginative book that has tons of action and excitement. Borrow, buy or beg for this book. Now!!
B001P9KR94|5.0|Blue Ray quality was excellent, with great sound track.<br /><br />This movie is brutal.  If I was from India, I would be livid at having my country portrayed like this.  That said, I researched on Google, and found that the movie does reflect the real India. The most brutal part was the blinding of homeless children, so they could make more money begging (money for their captors).  I'll pass on my plans to travel there.  I travel extensively, and it was on my list.  No more.  Excellent acting throughout.  Great story.  Disjointed in the beginning, but if you stay with it, it all comes together.  Great impact. Glad to be an American.
B0000026A8|5.0|About the artistry of this music, there's nothing I can add other than a ringing endorsement of the other reviewers' comments.<br /><br />It seems that all the versions of \\"Ah Um\\" that are currently available (early 2012) go to the unedited form of the studio performances.  Ditto for \\"Mingus Dynasty,\\" which was recorded the same year, 1959, for Columbia, and if not QUITE as phenomenal a set as \\"Ah Um,\\" is close enough to qualify as indispensable.<br /><br />These newer versions are a case where the \\"edited equals bad, unedited equals good\\" dictum falls flat.  It was Mingus himself who excised parts of various performances (6 out of 9 in the current context), and in all cases these result in a tighter form that more accurately reflects the composer's own intent.  Knowing that it was Mingus himself who made these alterations, how can anyone contend otherwise?  Granted that the digital remastering in the era of the preferred release (1990) might leave a little bit to be desired, this \\"as presented on the original vinyl\\" CD is still the one to get, but finding a copy at this point in time is a challenge.<br /><br />It is regrettable that the producer of the 1998 reissue felt entitled to overrule Mingus's intent on 10 of the 19 combined tracks appearing on \\"Dynasty\\" and \\"Ah Um.\\"  There have been a number of reissues of the two Columbia sessions since them, and to the best of my knowledge they all have the full unedited versions.  I am still an admirer of Michael Cuscuna for the great contributions he has made in reissueing important music in this genre, but no one is immune to error.  Anyway, enough about the second generation reissues.  Get the originals if you can.  They bear the \\"Columbia Jazz Masterpieces\\" imprint on the cover; the other versions do not.
0385341008|5.0|Anyone can imagine what a literary society might be but add the potato peel pie and well, doesn't that get your feline curiosity up? It did to the protagonist in the book as well, Juliet Ashton, who is a writer looking for a good book to write. One of the members of the society contacts her and there begins a correspondence which leads to a retelling of the German occupation of Guernsey during World War II.<br /><br />The Guernsey Literary And Potato Peel Pie Society, written by Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows, is told through the letters, telegrams, and a few diary notes. I thought at first I would be put off by that but these clever writers drew me in and developed their characters and story line expertly.<br /><br />History, human drama, and of course a little romance are all mixed together for a story \\"pie\\" that will satisfy every bit as much as one made of potato peels--maybe even more so. If I could have gotten all my history lessons in such a delightful way as this, I would not have hated those classes so much.
0684830485|4.0|I don't think I have ever taken so long to read a book and still finished it. This was my first major Hemingway and, so far from finding it direct and pithy, as the author is reputed to be, I thought it tedious and repetitive, turgid in its inner monologues, and astoundingly old-fashioned in its dialogues. And yet, and yet.... Hemingway, who saw the Spanish Civil War from the inside as a reporter, has a remarkable gift for describing places such as a guerilla camp in the high mountains, capturing the undertones between people who do not really trust one another, evoking the tension before a dangerous action, then setting out the course of that action in simple concrete terms. My reading accelerated as it went on, and in the end I could hardly put the book down.<br /><br />I turned to this after reading a much more recent book about that war, Dave Boling's [[ASIN:1596915633 GUERNICA]]. Despite the more approachable style of the later writer, Hemingway clearly has the larger vision. Whereas Boling writes a sweeping family saga, Hemingway confines himself to a three-day period in a single area. The hero, Robert Jordan, is an American instructor from a college in Montana fighting the fascists with the International Brigade. He is sent behind enemy lines to blow up a bridge spanning a mountain gorge. To do so, he must recruit the aid of local guerrilla bands, who may or may not trust him or each other. From this simple assignment, the scope spans out in thought and flashback to a much wider canvas, not so much of place and time but of moral vision. For Hemingway (clearly anti-fascist, but no card-carrying red either) is concerned at every turn with human dignity, the liberty which makes this possible, the love and hope which makes it worthwhile, and the apparent impossibility of preserving these values in wartime. This is a novel of substance.<br /><br />Unfortunately, neither Hemingway nor Boling avoids the temptation to romanticize the common people of another culture. Most of Hemingway's guerrillas are two-dimensional at best, and rather difficult to tell apart. The exceptions are Pablo, the once-fearless leader now turned cautious, and his wife Pilar. But Maria, the rape-survivor with whom Robert falls in love (or at least into bed), is a male fantasy of eager compliance; he even addresses her as \\"little rabbit\\"! Worst of all is Hemingway's extraordinary decision to render spoken Spanish by means of an exaggeratedly literal translation, leading to lines such as: \\"And what thinkest thou of this of the bridge?\\" and the immortal post-coital question: \\"Didst not thou feel the earth move?\\" And his description of the act itself, a breathless homage to James Joyce and Gertrude Stein, may be a literary tour-de-force, but in that simple context it is laughably overblown. Hemingway had a better connection than most to people's souls and the movement of the earth; if only he did not go to such lengths to prove it!ay's guerrillas are two-dimensional at best, and rather difficult to tell apart.

0316017922|1.0|While I get the premise of Gladwell's piece, it is difficult to ignore the historical inaccuracies and stereotyping of anyone not an urbanite sophisticate of certain advantage and lineage.     His definition of success is too limiting to accurately reflect what a truly successful life is, one might even call Gladwell's definition an outlier in the worst sense. I know many people who I consider successful intellectual outliers (i.e. on the high end of both creative and intellectual scales)who would fall quite far from Mr. Gladwell's narrowcast vision of success. He would likely consider them failures because their names are not well known and they are not among the most wealthy (among other things). Too bad, because they are some of the very people who make a positive difference in so many lives every day ...    While his concept of \\"success\\" coupled with his discussion of factors that may limit or encourage \\"success\\" would be the kind of superficial \\"analysis\\" expected from a business reporter's pen. I was a bit surprised, given Mr. Gladwell's background as a science reporter as well, that he shows no sign of acknowledging any kind of butterfly effect or causal questions generated by chaos and string theories.   I did finish the book, primarily because I kept thinking he would redeem himself. Alas, it did not happen. I should have heeded the warning flags that went up when he would begin a paragraph with something like an apology for the stereotypical drivel that was to follow .... Gee, I guess I'm just one of those who is destined to lead a life of failure with no one to have \\"breathed easier because I have lived.\\" (per Emerson)

0312427999|5.0|I started to read The Shock Doctrine in a loaned copy of the book recommended by my son-in-law.  After I finished the first two chapters, I realized that I had to make this book a permanent addition to my reference library.   Naomi Klein excels in explaining the true ideology and principles in which Milton Friedman based his free-market economic revolution and his terrifying experiments and infamous ways that he and his followers employ and still try to impose in disseminating his economic policies.  This is a great book that explains why in many countries across the world exists an antagonism toward the American influence in their internal affairs.
B002GZQYMK|4.0|Only a few tracks in and it's clear that British rockers Muse had a lot invested in \\"The Resistance.\\"<br /><br />The tremulous yet genuinely seductive \\"Undisclosed Desires\\" gives off a smooth, meditative vibe that smolders and lingers. So too does the awesome title track until the killer chorus kicks in with a refreshing torrent of electric guitars and soulful, push-all-the-buttons vocals from lead singer Matthew Bellamy. The raw, angst-ridden lead single \\"Uprising\\" is a solid track in spite of some trite, undercooked lyrics.<br /><br />Because high-quality playing is standard throughout the album, sometimes shadowing the melodies and Bellamy's expressive, longing vocals, some of the songs toward the center of the disc initially fade together. Increased, closer listens reveal the tracks' individual assets, however. The hard-rocking, soul-searching bravado of \\"MK Ultra\\" is a major highlight, as is \\"Guiding Light,\\" which finds Bellamy in cloying but endearing voice. The latter could be a major radio hit with its juicy, evocative melody and room-to-breathe arrangement and downright awesome guitar solo.<br /><br />The mostly instrumental three-song suite that closes the album invites accusations of self-indulgence, but Muse score major points with each, particularly the third, which brings the album to a graceful, ambient, achingly beautiful close before one final outburst of thundering drums and powerhouse vocals.<br /><br />\\"The Resistance\\" is a hell of a recording from a hell of a band. It goes for the throat a little too earnestly and tries to impress a little too much, but with a set of musicians with what is clearly above-average talent the results inevitably remain a pleasure.
0765356147|3.0|The Conclusion of the Mistborn Trilogy is interesting, but the book constantly breaks the \\"Show, Don't Tell Rule.\\"  As a result, the book reads like an encyclopedia, rather than an epic adventure.    Story:  All of the pieces of the puzzle come together in the fascinating Mistborn universe.  It begins one year after The Well of Ascension and answers all of the questions raised by the first two books.  If you were captivated by the Mistborn World and you enjoyed the first two books, this is a must read.  But before you read, I need to warn you about a few things!    Issue #1:  The History, Clues, and Puzzle Pieces of the Story are presented to the reader `wikipedia style' in italicized text before each Chapter begins:  \\"The Lord Ruler created the Koloss because...\\"  This causes problems.  The reader gets ahead of the characters.  If the book plainly tells you the answer to a riddle before the characters struggle through the riddle in the scene, it seems like the characters are bumbling around in the dark.  It is frustrating to watch them struggle to solve a problem that the book just presented to you in a simple manner.    Example:  The answer is 4. - pretend that was italicized.  Vin struggled to find out how many coins she needs to get from the rampart to the mess hall.  She retraced her steps several times to calculate the exact distance from the mess hall to the rampart.  It seemed as if it was 250 steps.  After, she experimented with steel pushing against coins and discovered that one push could send her approximately 50 feet at a 45 degree angle.  However, a tower was erected between the two points and was taller than the rampart.  Vin pushed to the top of the tower and discovered that the roof was metal and if she pulled, she could reach the top!  Vin started to experience self doubt, asking herself, \\"Can I figure this out?  Do I have enough coins?  Will Elend ever show any romantic interest in me at all?\\"  After figuring out the distance and realizing she could use the tower, she would need four coins!  - Pretend that was 12 pages long.    Issue #2  Rehashing  Creating an original fantasy world is incredibly difficult and there is always the risk of losing the reader.  But this book constantly rehashes the first two books every step of the way.  It becomes redundant and really slows down the pace of the book.  This could have been done a lot more efficiently.  It could also have been done in the italicized paragraphs before the actual Chapters!!!    Issue #3  Characters are less interesting  Because of the tedium and rehashing, the entertaining parts of the Chapters become few and far between.  The scenes should be full of action, humor, romance, wit, character building dialogue...  Because of the pacing, the characters all seem really flat.  It's like watching a bunch of insecure people solve a problem when you already know the answer.    Issue #4  Some of the action is lost.    Elend nimbly ducked a sword slash from a rushing swordsman, and planted the obsidian dagger into the swordsman's throat.  Another soldier charged Elend from behind.  He quickly steel pushed the dying man's sword into the rushing soldier, impaling him through the chest.  BECOMES  \\"Elend killed two guys.\\"    Issue #5  The world hasn't grown since Book 1.  The strength of the series is the original setting.  But the setting is exactly the same as the first book.  No new races, creatures, lands, or weather.  It's all ashen skies and misty nights.  What was captivating in Mistborn becomes a bit boring by this point.    Overall:  The Hero of Ages describes a very unique and interesting fantasy universe.  However, the scenes are lacking emotion, and all of the important events are plainly told to you at the beginning of each Chapter.  Because of this, you really feel a strong disconnect with the characters in the story and you may end up just flipping pages to see if anything interesting happens.      If you just want to appreciate an original, well thought out universe, then you will enjoy this book.  If you want a strong epic adventure with great characters, stop reading after Book 1.
0061120073|5.0|Is this a seminal, Americana classic? I sure think so after finally reading it, 30-years after my fingers first laid touch to its bindings. I'm sorry that I did not discover this insightful, understated work years earlier. This is easily on par with \\"The Grapes of Wrath,\\" and \\"The Good Earth;\\" perhaps even superior because it infuses humor into the salt-of-the-earth characters and storylines.     A tree does grow in Brooklyn; and it soars with redwood-stature. Highly recommended.

630460291X|2.0|I have heard this movie bantered around so much that I finally broke down and decided to watch it.<br />Robin Hood (Kevin Costner) returns to England from the Crusades with Azeem (Morgan Freeman), a Moor whom he saved in his escape from prison.  Upon their arrival, they learn that the Sherriff of Nottingham (Alan Rickman) has killed Robin's father and keeper of the lands (Brian Blessed) in the absence of King Richard (Sean Connery!).  Now, Robin wishes vengeance for his father's death, to rid the lands of the horrid Sherriff, and to woo the lovely Maid Marian (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio).<br />I know very little about the Robin Hood legend or myth (other than multiple childhood viewings of the Disney version of Robin Hood, which I am sure is less than accurate), so I can't really say much on the accuracy of the movie from a historical standpoint.  What I can say is how terrible it was from a viewer's standpoint.<br />But, first the good.  Then the bad.<br />The two highlights of this film were hands-down Morgan Freeman as the Moor, Azeem, and Alan Rickman as the Sherriff of Nottingham.  Both lit up the screen whenever they appeared and were a pure joy to watch.  Morgan Freeman, I felt, really captured his character (though, as others have said, the likelihood that a Moor would be so \\"welcomed\\" in England in this era is rather suspect).  I love his independence, yet devotion to Robin Hood.  In some ways, I feel he was a better sidekick than Little John (which is kinda sad, as I thought Little John was Robin Hood's sidekick, but alas, Hollywood changes history as it sees fit).  Too bad he wasn't in Moor of it (har har).  Alan Rickman seemed to be having marvelous fun and was positively delicious in this film.  He, hands down, gets the best lines from the riotous \\"I'll cut your heart out with a spoon\\" to his wonderful pickup lines \\"You. My room. 10:30 tonight. You. 10:45... And bring a friend\\".  Somehow, he is able to balance being wicked and laugh out loud funny and most definitely makes the other characters look like they are taking themselves WAY too seriously.<br />However, for the rest of the movie, I can't be so kind.  Kevin Costner as Robin Hood was cringe-worthy.  He was overdramatic, had no English accent (yeah, yeah, so there was a fight with the director, I get it), and was all around a pain to watch (and yes, I found him rather unattractive, which doesn't usually matter, but when all you're doing is staring at him and listening to him overact, it would be nice to have something nice to look at).  I found myself talking with my sister, my viewer in crime, during his scenes (aka most of the movie).<br />Speaking of Marian, Maid Marian was terribly done (Probably not all Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's fault, though I wasn't much fond of the actor).  As per Hollywood standards, we HAVE to have her introduced as a kick butt girl (in disguise as a man no less!), but then, in the end, she must be rescued from attempted rape by Robin??  Where is the ninja from the first part?  Why must the action girl always disappear so her \\"True Love\\" must rescue her?  Get a grip girlfriend!<br />And that was just the two man characters!  We haven't gotten to the plot yet!<br />I felt the story started way too early.  We have to watch Robin escape jail in the Holy Lands (agonizing), roll around in the sand on England (ridiculous), and parade across the land, saving the requisite child who gets chased into the tree by the Bad GuysTM (I am beginning to think I could write a script!).<br />But there is hope!  A shred of excitement begins, watching Robin take charge of the Merry Men (a little odd that he just usurps power from Little John, and I would LOVE to find out how they can melt iron and steel in the open air without blowers), his men ambushing caravans, and in general robbing from the rich to save the poor.  Great, perhaps this will make the movie worth it!  But then it is destroyed miserably when two \\"Merry Men\\" (actually the two stupidest of the bunch) attempt to ambush Marian and her requisite unattractive maid.  Of COURSE the two are escorted to the camp, of COURSE, they are blindfolded (so they can leave), and of COURSE, they get to see Robin Hood (Costner's body double) in the buff.  And why, must I ask, does he have a nude scene?  It makes absolutely zero sense and reduces what relationship he and Marian have to pure lust.  Gross.  As if that wasn't disgusting enough, Robin has to give Marian a tour (yawn), coo over her (wince), snuggle next to a campfire (groan), and leap to the aid of Little John's wife as she delivers a baby via Caesarean, thanks to the sudden midwife, Azeem.  What the heck is a childbirth scene doing in an action/adventure movie like Robin Hood?  Are we trying to draw the ER crowds or something?  Not to mention, Caesarean?  In this age (okay, so maybe I have a better feel for historical accuracy than I thought), I can't believe it would be doable and that the woman would survive!  At this point, I was completely outraged and screaming at the TV.<br />So besides two great, under-used actors (oh, the Friar was a kick, but unfortunately, he was underused too as was the maaaaaaaaaahvelous Sean Connery), the movie is drivel.  It reeks so bad of Hollywoodization, if you watch, you may want to bring a clothespin.  Easily over-powered women, predictable plot, horrid romance, and overdone acting.  I would suggest watching Freeman's and Rickman's performances only and skipping through the rest.  2 stars I feel is being more than generous.<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S.

0312370849|3.0|The most important thing about this book it that it makes more widely known the fate of the Jews in Paris during the Nazi occupation.  The first few chapters were so disturbing I almost didn't go on.  The contemporary story is difficult to buy.  The characters are on the borderline between typical and stereotypical.  The lead character's ability to track down the whole story strained credibility.  This book once again brought me to ask myself what would I have done if I were aware that Jews or anyone else was being exterminated.

B002C6K7N0|5.0|This is the best Megadeth release of the millennium, with United Abominations being a close second.  We finally have a solid lineup with Chris Broderick replacing Glen Drover on guitar.  Broderick's playing is extremely impressive and I've heard some comparisons of his playing to that of Marty Friedman's.  Chris is beyond technically talented, but his style is not quite on the same level as Marty's.  There are times on Endgame when I'm not sure if Dave or Chris is playing lead; when Marty was in the band there was never a question.  I need to give it a few more listens though to fully take in all of the guitar work; it is very technical, which I like.  Dave's playing has really evolved and I was blown away by many of his leads and all of the harmonies.    The lyrics are great, as usual, with Dave tackling the current and former presidential administrations, war, and the economy.  1,320', Head Crusher, and  The Right To Go Insane are standout tracks and there isn't a bad song to be found here.  Highly recommended for all Deth fans and anyone into thrash or technical metal.

The packaging & booklets that go with each cd are great!!   It was a special treat for me to hear the first 2 albums as I have never owned Meet the Beatles or the first album, so there were a bunch of songs on these two albums I had never actually heard!  Loved it!  I bought a BOZE sound machine to get a better listening experience and it all sounds great! Lots of Bass and clear as a bell! No hiss or tinny sounds at all!  Worth every penny!!
B002CMLIJ6|3.0|now i know, i didnt see it in theaters, and i didnt bother with the pirate version, i waited to own it. im not disappointed. the movie was decent, special features, not so much, unless you really want a digital 'copy' (who would?) go for the 10 dollar cheaper single disc. the brief Stan+Len exchange was nice, but im sure ittl be anywhere you wanna look for it on the net.  i never really liked the idea of the immortal wolverine, i know it opens up countless story options for writers, it always seemed kind of a cheap way to go with the origin. but if its gonna be that way, the movie treated it well enough, and the sibling rivalry was played well. nice to see gambit, one of the better parts of the movie.     for me it wouldve been alot more satisfying to see his first encounter with the hulk, and go(forward or back) from there. and generally, considering the available content, this couldve been an epic movie, not just ok.    i like jackman as wolverine alot, but ive had enough of the broken hearted, reflective, desperate, searching side of wolverine, i wanna see more of the rage filled kill crazy feral destruction machine that even he cant control. isnt that the characters main appeal?
B002GZQYMK|3.0|I hate to be the person to want a great band to re-make and re-make their greats. And I hate to be the one to say if a band sounds a certain way they must maintain that sound for the remainder of their albums. BUT... this is a bit different than the Muse I feel in love so deeply with. I could come to love this album but I can tell you now that will never be as much as Absolution, and for those of you who loved Absolution and most of Black Holes in the way I did, I know you will feel the same. There are a lot of really catchy spots in this album, but as a whole it seems stiched together from many many places. As a fan of Theivery Corp I've always loved this style of polar opposite songs one after the other, and I love the rock ballads. But for a band that spoke to the dark crevices of my naughty little heart this at some points got a little to \\"pop\\" for me. The words from the voice that uttered nectar before now utter words that rhyme so completely I knew what the end word of the next line would be just hearing the last word of the line being sung. Tonight, sight. Place, embrace. Right, ignite. Hole, Control. Last, fast. Fear, years. End, Pretend. Bloom, resume. Down, Around. Eye, Die. Back, attack. End, Ascend. Sure, songs rhyme, and looking back on Absolution there are a lot of rhyming sentances, but not as predictable, on cue, and expected. It just seems contrived, but at the same time it is that familier Muse sound that in it's newness I embrace. Some new music from one of my favorite bands is a welcome gift but I think when all the dust has settled in 5 years or so if a Muse-naive individual was looking them over on say, Amazon, they would see a much favored lean to the older stuff and hundreds of openings: \\"Good, but not their greatest.\\"

B002C6K7N0|5.0|It's obvious after listening to this album, that Megadeth is not slowing down.  Dave Mustaine has grown as a guitar player, and he is more dynamic now, but he can still shred like no other.<br /><br />It starts off with the instrumental Dialectic Chaos, nice thick big chords to open the album with a punch, and the song itself is blistering.  This puts me back into mind of the So Far, So Good!  Nice!<br /><br />This Day We Fight!  is a fast moving rhythym track that will have your ears bleeding.  This is a strong, fast track that shows they still have the speed.<br /><br />44 Minutes is more along the lines of songs from Countdown, the use of dynamics make the heavy chords sound all the heavier.  Nice bass line in this song too.  Nice solos in this one and a I think this one is a destined radio hit.<br /><br />It has been remarked by some other reviewers that Dave's lyrical content is getting stale.  He has always leaned towards politics and war, and I agree that his other stuff is more compelling.<br /><br />1,320  - The opening riff of this song took me back to when I first heard their song Peace Sells, the tone, the fast blistering riffing.  Blast this one!<br /><br />Bite the Hand That Feeds You - this song has an epic heaviness about it, nice fat chunk and then to a faster rhythym, probably one of my favorite riffs on the cd so far.  (that will change in time!)<br /><br />Bodies Left Behind - again, nice bass!  Clear chorus, also has radio potential.<br /><br />Endgame - This title track starts off with a typical Megadeth theatrical moment, but this song never loses it's strength, this one will be remembered.<br /><br />The Hardest Part of Letting Go - wow, nice acoustic and nylon string guitar with the strings in the beginning is something I don't often hear from this band, and this small track and Dave's voice at the forefront is I think a pretty brave act for Dave at this point and on this record.  I think it was the right one, this is nice.  Ofcourse it picks up...but this IS Megadeth.<br /><br />Head Crusher - typical Mustaine, burning the fretboard to wood chips.<br /><br />How The Story Ends - This had a classic tone and sound to my ears, which I really dig!  The riff in this one is amazing too.<br /><br />The Right to Go Insane - sweet bass line opens this song, I am really surprised at the bass on this record.  A really nice chorus on this one.  RADIO here comes MEGADETH.<br /><br />I was expecting the guitar to be amazing, it's Dave Mustaine and now he has Chris...jeez, what a combination.  But it was a nice surprise to hear a high bass presence in this album and the drum work is not bad either.  This album delivers in my estimation.

0385504225|4.0|I've read all of Dan Brown's books, and while I'm not a huge fan, I do enjoy his stories and the fantastical idea that there could be some huge conspiracy or esoterica out there that only a few people know about.  Dan Brown's writing could use some work, and he's not crafting great literature here, but the content of his stories usually makes up for that, and his latest novel, The Lost Symbol, is no exception.  This is the third book to follow Robert Langdon, a Harvard Symbologist who previously showed up in [[ASIN:074349346X Angels & Demons: A Novel (Robert Langdon)]], and [[ASIN:0307474275 The Da Vinci Code]].<br /><br />The Lost Symbol is very similar to his previous books, in that it has the same formulaic plot, structure, and theme, only this time it takes place in Washington, D.C. and involves the Freemasons instead of the Knights Templar.  Just like in the Da Vinci Code, Langdon is called to Washington at a friend's request, only to find him missing, and spends the rest of the book chasing clues throughout the city and trying to outwit a new villain who is seemingly as smart as he is.<br /><br />As mentioned above, the formula in The Lost Symbol is almost exactly the same.  After only a few chapters into the book, I started drawing immediate comparisons to [[ASIN:B00005JN5E National Treasure (Widescreen Edition)]], and I could see some readers making that claim if it weren't for a few exceptions:  Langdon is more likable than Ben Gates, the mysteries are much more involved and well-researched, and there is noticeably more action and suspense.  This time, rather than trying to ignore some rather large plot holes, as contained in the Da Vinci Code, you will have to suspend your disbelief that a Harvard professor is physically capable of so many close calls.  It almost reads more like an Ian Fleming novel than a book about a mid-50s professor trying to solve a centuries-old scavenger hunt.  That works out well because a lot of books of this genre can get weighed down by the scientific or historical aspects and bore you to death.<br /><br />That's not to say that The Lost Symbol doesn't have its faults.  The first is most notably the writing.  While it has certainly improved since The Da Vinci Code, it still seems rather sophomoric, and not on par with someone who is one of the biggest-selling authors in the last twenty years.  Even though it's fiction, some of the characters' actions really made me wonder if Brown has had much human contact while writing the book.  There are other annoyances that he repeats in the book, but I won't bring them up for fear that mentioning them may cause future readers to have their attention constantly drawn to them.  Overall though, the writing is not terrible and the plot is suspenseful enough that I can overlook it.  Another theme that Brown plays around with is the concept of \\"mind over matter.\\"  He provides a great deal of research on the subject (too much in some chapters), but I still found it a little too out there, and wish he had chosen a different angle.<br /><br />I think this book will appeal not only to Dan Brown fans, but to fans of Douglas Preston and Lee Child (Langdon is almost a clone of the Agent Pendergast character), James Rollins, Michael Crichton (there are certainly a lot of influences here as far as research into a book goes), and with this book, Clive Cussler (the action is on par with anything Dirk Pitt would see).<br /><br />If I had to rank it, I would put The Lost Symbol below Angels and Demons, and above Da Vinci Code.  While I don't think it's worth of 5 stars, it was certainly an enjoyable read and enough to satiate me until the next book comes out (provided he doesn't wait as long as he did for this one).scientific or historical aspects and bore you to death.

B000A2RRF4|5.0|I had seen Live in Bucharest on tv recently and it was absolutely mesmerizing to watch and I felt like I was right there taking in this amazing concert. I ordered it from Amazon and it is a dvd I know I will never tire of watching. To me, this is Michael truly at his best and his energy and mastery in his performance is just something you can't take your eyes off of. There are cut aways to the audience several times but I did not mind that as it captured the incredible emotion from his fans and believe me they were enjoying this concert! I loved all of the songs and it was wonderful to see such joy in Michael's face..there was one moment in particular that was really moving to me, when he was singing Heal the World he brought out several children, among others, and at one point while singing he picked up a small child and held him as he sang and Michael had such a loving look in his face, so happy, and he giggled and it was just such a genuine, sweet moment..the true essence of the loving sweet soul and gentle spirit that Michael was. I really wish Michael could have known how much he was loved and how many people have been affected by his loss. I am so grateful to have this dvd to cherish and relive his wonderful memory..it is a heartwarming, uplifting experience watching this dvd and I shed some happy tears and some sad ones. Thank you Michael for sharing your wonderful gifts and loving soul with the world.
B002FOQY04|5.0|As everyone is saying, no bonus tracks! I also don't have a bonus DVD? What gives?    EDIT:    I pre-ordered the Deluxe version of this album and it came with no bonus tracks.  Recently, Amazon.com contacted me and said they had made an error and wanted to know if I'd like a CD sent to me with the tracks.  I said I would.  Today, I received in the mail a CD with the 3 songs, as well as a sticker, two pins and a mini poster with a note apologizing.  That was very generous of Amazon, and I'd like to thank them!
B002BSHXJA|5.0|When you open this box, there is going to be a big smile on your face, I guarantee it.  The love and attention to detail shows in every inch of this box set.  The mini-LPs are marvelous, with every single detail, inserts, inner sleeves, vinyl inner label design on the cds, etc.  The set is visually perfect.  And no, \\"mono\\" doesn't mean that it's antiquated, for audiophiles only, or for extreme Beatle fans only.  The mono mixes of most of these albums are preferable to the stereo versions.  This set is simply amazing.  Toppermost of the poppermost!

B002ELM5HY|4.0|Mark Knopfler's latest is a very gentle, beautiful set of tunes.  It's mellow rock, often with a Celtic twist.  For those of us who enjoyed his more recent forays into more heavily traditional forms but still longed for the glory days, it's a relief that Mr. K has gone back to a sound that's closer to his early solo material (and Dire Straits).  In particular, songs such as \\"So Far From The Clyde\\" are broad-canvas, cinematic works that create interesting characters and places of the kind Mark has given us for so many years.  It's the story-telling side of him; one of his greatest skills.  There is a bit of variety on Get Lucky, with a brief detour into blues (\\"You Can't Beat the House\\"), and a song that draws from his movie scoring experience, the lovely \\"Monteleone.\\"  Otherwise, the songs on this album are all slow-tempo and relaxing.  Knopfler could breathe fire on occasion in the past, but now it's more like the laid-back Mark.  About the only fire we hear on Get Lucky comes from a few zesty guitar solos now and then.
B002C6K7N0|4.0|This album is a giant step in the right direction for Megadeth. I'm proud of Dave Mustaine for continuing to make great music. Dave has always had an excellent supporting cast of band members and I believe he has achieved that once again by adding guitarist Chris Broderick. Many have been wanting Megadeth to get the older sound back and you can definitely hear it on this album. Compared to other Megadeth albums I would put this one at #6 with this order. (1)Peace Sells... But who's Buying! (2)Rust in Peace (3)Countdown to Extinction (4)Youthanasia (5)Cryptic Writings (6) Endgame (7)The World Needs a Hero (8)So Far, So Good... So What!  and so on!

0451529308|3.0|I never read the book in this form, but did read it many years ago.  I gave it three stars based on what is think of it, which is four or five stars, and the fact that my grand-daughter was bored, which deserves maybe two stars.  I think before you buy books, you should try to know the book and the child fairly well beforehand, in terms of what you think they would like.  I know that many kids will dislike a book which many others like (like you today, perhaps).  Considering the caveat I said, I'd consider buying it.
B002AOWXO0|3.0|Despite the seemingly desperate attempt to grab at credibility from both artists, this album has something to offer. Nice guitars and the lack of overwhelming listener fatigue that goes with modern production methods. \\"Relator\\" is slighlty less than a rip-off but more than an homage of \\"Eight Days A Week\\" and there is a meandering cover of Chris Bell's \\"I Am the Universe.\\"<br /><br />It is way more interesting than either one's musical output, IMHO ... but, most importantly, the two single out the main element of modern music that drives me nuts: They both sing in the most AFFECTED voices ever. Whatever happened to finding your voice, which was always the first rule of singing when I was being taught?<br /><br />Overall it might be worth $2.99 (what with the constant begging from Amazon to use their dumb download service) but modern music is still hobbling along. Sharply counterpointed by the Beatles massive catalogue dump a week ago. What has happened to music?<br /><br />3/5 for not irritating me with monster production and scales for singing.

I'm better off driving over to Walmart to buy my new DVD's.
0316172324|3.0|I've never been quite as disappointed with such a page-turner.  I give this book 4 stars on pacing, style, and level of interest, but 1.5 stars on synthesis.  The author has a remarkable ability to captivate the reader with a series of stories that are at times quite technical, but he fails on his promise in the introduction to show us when to trust our first impressions, and when they lead us astray.  What was it about the kouros-statue experts that made their first impressions right, but made the NYPD officers who shot an innocent man 41 times wrong?  The author never really tells us.  In the end, the author seems to imply that our intuitions are to be trusted when they produce good results--a wholly unsatisfying conclusion that gives us no guidance going forward.

B0002C4JE4|3.0|The sound quality is excellent, but there are only 12 songs, and not all of them should be included as greatest hits.  I would have left off \\"Walking Man\\" and \\"Something in the Way She Moves\\", neither of which were singles hits.  And I would have included songs like \\"Long Ago and Far Away\\" and \\"Mockingbird\\", both top 40 singles hits.     Be advised that \\"Steamroller\\" is a live version, albeit a good one.    For a 2004 issue, this CD should have \\"Volume One\\" included in the title.    FYI: I'm a record collector of 55 years and a sometimes deejay.
0545123267|2.0|I bought this book after reading the great reviews.  I have to admit that I am a huge Twilight fan and this was recommended by someone on a fan site.  I thought I would give it a try.<br /><br />In all fairness, I didn't read the whole book so maybe it gets good towards the end to deserve the reviews it got, but I got half way through and had to stop.  I couldn't stand the main character and her fascination with the wolf, Sam, that saved her life.  I thought the characters were pathetic.  I thought that they were trying to rip off the aspects that made Twilight popular and just change around the characters a little bit.  The writing was just so sappy that I couldn't get through it.  I recommend the Twilight Series if you want to read a Sci-Fi Love Story.
B002EWD08Q|4.0|We all know the cybernetic version of Cinderella starring the Arctic Monkeys like the national anthem: a band born in the myspace era that saw them become audience and critics darlings overnight. Backed by the smartly named campaign \\"Don't believe the hype\\" they soared steadily and even though their follow-up was not as rotund in its offer as their debut their popularity did not dwindled a bit.     For their third record they have enlisted QOTSA frontman Josh Homme and Last Shadow Puppets' producer James Ford, both of who do not stain the Arctic Monkeys perspective but rather make it grow. Homme's presence can be perceived cleary in the vocals and the darker soundscape of heavier guitars. Ford's touch shows in the detailed arrangements that had been previewed in his work with the Puppets.    Singer Alex Turner sounds more mature, and that is a term that will stick in one's head throughout this album as the band is obviously taking baby steps into new horizons, cautiously but with determination. Growing up is a reality they have decided to embrace musically and the results have sprung a surprising detour on their ascension road.     Potion approaching and Cornerstone, two of the finest moments, are perfect examples of the new territories they explore: they are thinking sonically without abandoning the candid approach to lyrics. Lead single Crying lightning is not as immediate as anything off the infectious Whatever people say I am, that's what I'm not but it grows with each listening. Pretty visitors, rumored to be the next and third single, reminisces of their hyped-up more straightforward beginnings, while The jeweller's hands gives an amazing closing to a record that is destined to last beyond its immediacy.     Edgy sounds great in Humbug. Not only Turner's physique has become more robust, the entire the band has developed into a welcome improvement from the startling Favourite worst nightmare. Sexual innuendo, aggression and love declarations are omnipresent with a humorous and perverse twist that only helps to make the record sound complete and to slowly disengage it from angst-punk. The lyrics keep telling stories as usual but now they are embedded with melody; emotions turn into deviant habits and observance gives cue to elongated introspection.     It is not precise to call them a youth garage band anymore as their sound has expanded and landed them almost side to side with the big ones. It would be absurd to deny the improvements they've made in only four years as it would not be gratuitous to affirm that shall they continue not relishing on the success of first-timer luck, and we are quite sure that will be the case, they will be very soon looked at above the shoulder by everybody.

B002GZQYMK|4.0|Muse has been compared to just about any band in the British landscape from the moment set foot on a stage. Fortunately this has not affected their sense of identity and that once loathed alien/apocalyptic/surreal vision of the world has led them straight to the top of the charts and to the iPods of more people than we care to admit.    What is the appeal they have over their listeners? First, they CAN write great tunes but they add a twist and make them ridiculously fun. Second, they don't take themselves seriously and unlike most of their contemporaries they are able sail from political denounces to comedic spurts without problem. Third, they take in all the comparisons and make them part of who they are.    This is the most obvious point in their fifth studio recording. Having blown open the contrived label that capsuled \\"prog-rock\\" with Absolution and take it a notch further with Black holes and revelations, The resistance shows a Muse refusing to mature completely and using all their cards under the sleeve to reinvent a nearly extinct genre. This time the results might be less colored and more grey than in previous opportunities, but never dull.    As if the banner had been raised from the start first single United States Of Eurasia is an open homage to Queen, not only in length but in composition. Give or take some nods at Chopin and even the presence of an Exocet launch at the end. The rest of the album will see Matt Bellamy, Christopher Wolstenholme and Dominique Howard indulging in their conspiracy theories, orchestral fascination and spacial aesthetics.     They move from ballads (I belong to you) to straightforward rock (Unnatural selection) to a symphony in three movements (Exogenesis) that will not only give you an inside out cerebral trip but also leave you craving for nothing else when the odyssey is over. Uprising is a radio friendly cut that most reminisces what they've done in the past (like a breeding between the jolly Supermassive black hole andthe sinister Time is running out), while the title track gives cue to the plot behind the record's concept: resistance against general corporatocracy and the idea that love can cross boundaries between different political views and religious beliefs.      One thing is impossible to deny: they have managed to deliver yet another amusing and tightly arranged album. The composition along with Bellamy's incredible vocals are exquisite in execution, and we can only imagine how this record will sound live. As Chris conferred on a recent interview, their sound does not necessarily becomes bigger but different. Whether they have achieved that with The Resistance is something each listener will have to deduce; if you asked me I would tell you I am eagerly expecting their new material.
0446698342|3.0|This wasn't one of my absolute favorites--just okay. I have read several Nicholas Sparks novels and I put this one in the category of \\"True Believer\\" and its sequel, \\"At First Sight\\".<br /><br />By now the author pretty much has a formula which he follows in most of his books: always set it his home state of North Carolina, there is always a storm where the plot twists and/or reaches its climax, someone usually dies, and the couples always fall in love and end up in bed--usually, boring, uninteresting sex ensues. This 14th novel is no different.<br /><br />Logan Thibault is an ex-marine in search of a woman whose photo he's been carrying for the past five years. He found it in the sand in Iraq and ever since he has carried it, he has felt lucky. It has helped him win big at poker games, and kept him alive in situations that, by all accounts, should have ended his life. His friend, Victor tells him he has a debt to pay to the woman in the photo as it has proved to be a lucky charm. When tragedy strikes, Logan follows his friend's advice and sets out on foot, with his dog, Zeus, from Colorado to North Carolina, stopping along the way to seek information about E.--the only letter of the woman's name found on the back of the photo.<br /><br />Upon entering Hampton County, Logan has a run in with the local sherrif who doesn't like the looks of him or of his German shepard. This sherrif later on becomes a big player in this story as he interferes in Thibault's life and plans.<br /><br />Here is where the action begins. Of course, Thibault finds the woman in the photograph and what usually happens in Sparks novels happens, but the story lacked the passion found in \\"The Notebook\\" and \\"Nights in Roadanthe\\". I don't feel like Sparks ever really peels back enough of the layers that make up these characters. I never get to know them as well as I should. A lot of his stories are just on the surface--and once in a while he ends up with a winner like the two previously mentioned books. For the most part though, his books are airport novels--an appropriate read to pass the time but it doesn't stay with you. I have found that to be the biggest disappointment with most of his books. NONE of them are keepers. Here is another one for the donation pile.gh, his books are airport novels--an appropriate read to pass the time but it doesn't stay with you.

B002C6K7N0|4.0|Easily their best since Countdown.  I can understand the review saying it is heavy for the sake of being heavy, but it really is not the case.  I felt that way with the last two albums, both of which sounded like they were trying to rewrite a combo of Take No Prisoners and Youthansia over and over.  I cannot believe Dave still has it in him.  Highlights are Dialectic Chaos, This Day We Fight, 1320 (which has a Skull Beneath the Skin feel to it), and Head Crusher.  It makes me wonder though, did it take the release of Death Magnetic for him to write something this good?
1416914307|4.0|I have waited months in line for this book to come to me from my library and I was not disappointed. City of Glass, Book 3 of Cassandra Clare's Mortal Instruments series begins with Clary planning to go to Idris, the city of the Nephilim, or demon hunters,to find a book that will break the spell which has Clary's mother in a perpetual state of unconsciousness. Unfortunately, Jace doesn't want her there. She believes it is because he no longer cares for her as he used to. But I am getting ahead of myself. A little backstory is in order for those of you who have no idea what this series is about.<br /><br />Clarissa \\"Clary\\" Fray leads the typical life of a teenager in \\"Buffyesque\\" Manhattan. One night she heads for a teen club with her best friend, Simon and witnesses a murder. Unfortunately, no one else can see the murderers and when she sends for help, even the body has disappeared. The murderers are actually demon hunters sworn to protect humankind from demons, werewolves, vampires, and all kinds of unnatural beasts that would threaten their existence. The fact that Clary can actually \\"see\\" them causes the hunters some consternation and it unwittingly draws her into their world. That ability is later explained by her past--a past kept secret from her by her mother at all costs.<br /><br />One of the demon hunters, or Nephilim, is Jace Wayland---a cocky, irressistible 17 year-old young man who dismisses Clary as a weak \\"mundane\\"--nickname given to humans with no magical powers. Clary is instantly annoyed with Jace's airs of superiority and shows him that she can take care of herself just fine. When her mother disappears and she is almost killed by a demon, Jace's impression of Clary is immediately changed for the better when she kills the demon in self-defense. Attraction ensues to the vehement denial of both.<br /><br />You know what comes next: plenty of danger, magic, romance and a real badass of a villain. Add snappy dialogue a la Buffy and two love triangles and your in for sexy ride. Plenty of tragedy and secrets awaits in this fun trilogy which concludes with City of Glass. Let's hope Cassandra Clare keeps writing more books about the Nephilim world.de. Plenty of tragedy and secrets awaits in this fun trilogy which concludes with City of Glass. Let's hope Cassandra Clare keeps writing more books about the Nephilim world.
0064400557|5.0|Wilbur is a white, runty pig who lives in Homer Zuckerman's barn.  He is childish, innocent, and amiably piggy, and has two good friends: Fern, the girl who rescued him at birth, and an intelligent spider named Charlotte, who spins her web above his pen.  One day the old sheep in the barn informs Wilbur of his future as bacon and ham, and Charlotte promises to rescue him from this dreadful fate.  How she intends to keep her promise remains to be seen, and her plan unfolds in chapter after delightful chapter.  The story closes soon after the natural end of her life, and Wilbur, mourning her loss, welcomes her children into his life.<br /><br />White's writing is masterful, with a gentle touch and careful observation of human nature.  This memorable story provides an example of genuine, loving friendship, which blooms among the hard realities of farm life: in the natural course of things, Charlotte does trap and eat insects, and the people do kill the animals they care for.  In fact, without Fern's intervention Wilbur's life would have met an early end as the runt of his litter.  But even given their pork-eating inclinations, the people on this farm are goodwilled and faithfully care for their livestock.  The geese are hilariously goosey, and the old sheep provides several instances of savvy wisdom.  Templeton the rat is memorable in his odious self-centeredness.  Because the general tone of the book is warm, Charlotte's death stands out as an event of profound sadness.  But it is the contrasts that have made this story such an enduring classic -- the reality of death and sadness make the joy and sweetness all the better where they exist.<br /><br />This is a chapter book with occasional illustrations, and should appeal best to ages 5-10.  Because its story quality appeals to a wide age range, I recommend it as a first chapter book, although parents ought to be aware that Charlotte's death may come as a shock to sensitive listeners.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|This album flows very well and is very flavorful and fun. I can see Muse snobs not liking this record but I'm not one of those people. If I had to say negative things about this release it would mainly center around the blatant 'Queenish' sounds they ripped off and inserted into a few songs. Other than that, these songs stay in your head and you can't help but contemplate them during the day.
031606792X|5.0|All of Stephenie Meyer's books are great. I started reading Twilight back before I'd ever heard about it (before the movies were made) because I was bored and looking for something different. I read it in less than a day ... and after that I had to buy all of them (but Breaking Dawn wasn't out yet ... it was very hard to wait for it). This book, Breaking Dawn, is my very favorite of the series. I have heard many mixed-reviews of this book, and I am telling you that you really have to read it for yourself and decide. All of Stephenie's books are written with exceptional taste and awesome detail. I am so glad that I decided to read these books! Stephenie Meyer is a very talented writer, and I really hope that we get to see more from her very soon. All 4 of the books in this series are the kind that you really can't put down (or really don't want to) until you're done. And then once you are done, you want to pick them up and start all over again! I know I did ...
B001P5HI4A|2.0|I'm a great fan of Barbra Streisand, and it is obvious that she put her heart and soul into this film. It is beautifully filmed and treats the material with an almost heavy-handed reverence. But try as I might to like \\"Yentl,\\" I just couldn't.<br /><br />This story has been told, and told, and told. From \\"Some Like it Hot,\\" to \\"Victor, Victoria,\\" to \\"Tootsie,\\" the idea of a woman/man pretending to be a man/woman, only to be faced with the dilemma of falling in love and having to reveal their secret...we have seen this tale so many times. Unfortunately for \\"Yentl,\\" there is nothing new or surprising in this version of the gender-changing story, and others have done a far better job of telling it. It is as predictable as the moon phases and far less interesting. Not for one minute does Barbra Streisand make a convincing man, and I found myself spending the entire film puzzling that her obvious femininity seemed to be lost on the other characters. Barbra's singing is, of course, wonderful. She truly possesses one of the most powerful and stunning voices in film history. But her incredible voice is wasted on a collection of dull and forgetable songs.<br /><br />\\"Yentl\\" wants very much to be a classic in the vein of \\"Funny Girl.\\" The final shot in the film is an obvious attempt to recapture the same magic Streisand gave us as Fanny Brice hitting that massive note at the end of \\"Don't Rain on My Parade.\\" For me it fell flat along with the rest of the film.<br /><br />I guess even a great talent like Streisand is entitled to a stinker.

B00127RAJY|5.0|If you follow the 30 Day Shred consistently, you WILL see results! I am toned all over due to this video. Pants that were too tight now slide right on! But this is how I do it:     I decided to spend 30 days on each level before progressing to the next level. Therefore, I did 30 days on Level 1 and today was my first day at level 2. Believe me, it was tough and there would have been no way I could have completed level 2 without spending 30 days doing Level 1 (I will come back and update my progress after completing level 2).    I started level 1 using 5 pound weights. But 5 pounds became too light after awhile so now I use 8 pounds.     I don't use this tape solely for exercise. I also do cardio kickboxing dvds and other workouts. But I try to do the 30 Day Shred at least 5 to 6 times a week. I find this workout to be intense but also challenging and dare I say it, fun. Yes, fun. I feel great when I complete it!    If you were considering a trainer, I say save your money and get this DVD instead. Get all of Jillian's DVDs. This is the best money you'll ever spend if you stick to it. Yes, these are tough workouts but if you develop the habit of doing these workouts consistently, I guarantee you will see results.     That said, it definitely helps to track your calories. There's no point in putting in all this effort if poor eating habits don't change. Also, I do this workout in the mornings so I have no excuses not to do it after work. It's a great way to start your day!

0887307280|4.0|Doubtless, E-Myth Revisited contains much of value for the budding entrepreneur, and almost anyone could benefit from considering the talking points it contains.     Unfortunately, the prose only ranges from tolerable to abysmal. The tortured dialog form, in which the imagined participants constantly(!) refer to each other by name, is endurable but distracting. Five stars for content -- minus one for ghastly writing.    Avoid \\"E-Myth Mastery\\" at all costs if this style bothers you. Here a quote from successive paragraphs to provide a taste of what awaits (p.71, E-Myth Mastery):    We hugged each other like old, old friends do, and spoke each other's names --\\"Hi Michael,\\" \\"Hi Sarah\\"--and then moved apart to look at each other again.    \\"I'm so glad we decided to meet in person, Sarah,\\" I said, ...    \\"Me too, Michael,\\" Sarah responded sweetly, truly meaning it.    \\"Sarah, you'll have all the time you need.\\"    Uuuurrgghh!!! Like main-lining saccharine...; I wasn't able to force all of it down. Too bad Harper Business didn't provide editing. Or ghost writing.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|Any true Beatles fan will recognize the IMPORTANCE of these mono masters. It's not \\"hype\\" from Apple; the Beatles themselves, especially John, were quite outspoken about which mix they thought best represented their work, going so far as to dismiss certain stereo mixes (John famously denounced the stereo mix of \\"Revolution\\" as \\"a piece of ice cream\\" and observed \\"you haven't heard Sgt Pepper unless you've heard it in mono\\").    Similarly, those same Beatle fans will want the stereo mixes too (a) because they're REALLY good listening; (b) to have a complete set; and (c) to do the inevitable comparisons.    And while some may quibble about not having both mixes on single discs, from a general release perspective, I think the masses will be quite satisfied with them being on individual releases, and probably just grab the stereo ones.    My only disappointment was that \\"Abbey Road\\" and \\"Let It Be\\", which were recorded and only ever mixed in stereo (not mono) were not included in the box. \\"Fold down\\" mono mixes were released on these two (albeit in minor markets, such as South America) and could have easily been replicated, so that we'd have a complete catalog in mono. For that matter, NEW (read: official) mono mixes could have been prepared as a REAL treat for collectors, making these two albums available in mono on CD for the first time.
B000002H33|5.0|I remember this being my first experience with Metallica, After of Course Seeing the Music Video \\"ONE\\" as A Kid, Which was one of my Favorite if not Favorite Song ever. This was Metallica At it's Zenith, The Best Album. My First Album I Had of Them Back in 93/94/95' I had the Cassette Tape*Later my Brother got the Cd I Introduced him to it*, I would listen to Master OF Puppets, Songs are heavy hitting, Realizing now some had social type message that I might not like.\\"Solider boy, made of Clay..\\"(anti-War?)  Favorite Being Leper Messiah, a Great song. all songs on here are awesome. Before And Justice For all(which Had \\"One\\" Beautiful song) and last album with Cliff Burton(R.I.P.) Sadly.

630522577X|5.0|I can never resist using \\"My Fair Lady\\" to teach G.B. Shaw's Pygmalion. The contrast between the biting satire in the original version and the lavish Hollywood production provides a plethora of opportunities for discussion. Naturally, however, when one shows a dated Hollywood musical to a class of today's high school students, one runs the risk of yawns, boredom, and little naps during the movie. But the songs and sets and silly jokes seem to worm their way into students' brains despite their efforts to be blase, and it always turns out for the best.

0375842209|5.0|The reviewers on Amazon overwhelmingly suggest (and I heartily agree) that Marcus Zusak's THE BOOK THIEF is an amazing read.  As a ninth-grade English teacher, I'd like to add that this book works extremely well in the classroom.  With Death as the narrator, students eagerly analyze and discuss point-of-view.  And, there are many wonderful metaphors and similes, making this a great resource for introducing figurative language.  I've been teaching for twenty-three years, and THE BOOK THIEF elicits more discussion from my students than any other novel.  Please consider using this novel in your classroom, especially with reluctant readers.
B000066NW0|4.0|It was very easy to get sick and tired of teen-aged girls singing dance-pop as there seemed to be an endless supply of them for several years.  Finally we have a new artist playing rock, and while one might be tempted to give it high-marks for that alone, the fact is Avril Lavigne earns high praise for her debut album, \\"Let Go\\".  Avril Lavigne was just 17 when she released this album in 2002, and while it isn't perfect or anywhere near the best rock album ever, it certainly was a breath of fresh air.    The album opens very strong with \\"Losing Grip\\", \\"Complicated\\", \\"Sk8er Boi\\", and \\"I'm with You\\" which are the four main singles from the album.  The fifth piece, \\"Mobile\\" was also released as a single, but only in Australia and New Zealand. Though these are all singles, there is still a fair amount of diversity in them.  \\"Complicated\\" and \\"Sk8er Boi\\" both have a bit of a Teen Pop feel to them.  \\"Losing Grip\\" is a heavier piece, and \\"I'm With You\\" is a ballad.  \\"Mobile\\" is a bit of a reach as a single, but is a decent piece and falls somewhere in the middle.  Next up is \\"Unwanted\\" is another heavier piece, and gives the album some depth with a solid piece which is clearly not a single.  \\"Tomorrow\\" is the midpoint of the album and one of the weaker pieces on the album, but still not a bad song, and once again it offers a bit of diversity from the harder style rock which is what most of the album is.    \\"Anything But Ordinary\\" brings the quality back up, and starts off a string of Teen Pop songs.  \\"Things I'll Never Say\\" falls into the same category somewhat, and is another solid contribution to the album.  \\"My World\\" is another teen angst piece, and continues with the Teen Pop feel of the second half of the album.  \\"Nobody's Fool\\" brings some more diversity to the album, with some mini-rap sections by Avril.  It is one of the weaker pieces on the album, but one can appreciate the attempt at having more than one sound.  \\"Too Much to Ask\\" is another weaker piece, but as with all the pieces on the album it isn't bad and doesn't detract too much from the overall effort.  \\"Naked\\" closes the album and is a little stronger than the preceding two pieces, but overall the second half of the album isn't as good as the first.     This is a very strong debut album for Avril Lavigne.  She co-wrote all the songs, some of them with Clif Magness, others with a group called \\"The Matrix\\", a couple with Sabelle Breer and Curtis Frasca, and then one with Peter Zizzo.  There is a fair amount of diversity in sound and her voice suits all the pieces well.  Overall, this album falls somewhere between 4 and 4½ stars.

B002BSHXJA|2.0|...this set is SOOOO disappointing to those of us who love the mono Beatles material and wanted a serious sonic upgrade.  I'll always remember the feeling I got when I heard the Stones Singles Box Set after it was remastered in SACD.  The clarity, richness and realism was outstanding, a VERY serious upgrade in sound over the previous CDs and LPs.    Nothing could be further from the truth with this box.  The sound is dull and flat.  My old mono albums and singles sound better, and that is the truth.  It doesn't come close to comparing to what DESS has done with this material, and all he (they, whatever) had to work with was pristine LPs and reel to reel tapes.  Imagine what they could have done if they had the 1st generation masters to work with!    Some CDs are worse than others.  Rubber Soul is probably the best of the lot, certainly the album that comes the closest in sound to my old LP and the DESS release.  But it doesn't BETTER the sound of those sources, and I really thought that was the point.    The worst, by far, is Help!  This is particularly disappointing for me since I don't have the DESS or the original LP.  I'm serious, there can't be a frequency over 6,000 hertz on this remaster.  Overtones?  Cymbals?  Room ambience?  Don't look here.    The packaging is cool...little mini-reconstructions of the original Parlophone/Apple LP releases, down to the reproduction of the slip covers (don't forget to the EMItex cleaning cloth).  But I've got to say, that's a whale of a lot of money to pay for miniature facsimiles of the stuff you can put your hands on.      Problem is, we got miniature facsimiles of the stuff you wrap your ears around as well.    For those of you who haven't heard a good vinyl copy of these albums, I guess you don't know what you are missing, though I have a hunch that anyone with good ears and a good sound system can tell that something's seriously lacking here.  I honestly don't know what could have happened.  Most of the remastered stereo box/reissues are very good.  But sadly, such is not the case with these mono remasters.    I've never paid so much for so much disappointment.    I never thought I'd write this, but please, PLEASE can we have the 3rd Capitol box, so I can get a decent mono Revolver, Yesterday & Today, SPLHCB and Magical Mystery Tour?  Cheezy as those Capitol boxes were, the sound was exemplary.    And, to quote Forrest Gump, that's all I'm going to say about that.

B0025KVLTC|2.0|Broke down and bought the remastered Revolver the other night.  Listened down three times, and here is my report: It's clean and clear, but no improvement whatsoever over my 1982 British-pressed vinyl release on Parlophone.  That's not to say it isn't good, but that pressing from `82 was always the one to beat, to my ears.<br /><br />The big advantage of digital technology is not clarity, but dynamic range.  Analog can be (and typically is) perfectly clear and defined, but has limits, especially in the case of vinyl as compared to tape, with big shifts from soft to loud.  The CD, when it came out, was touted as being able to accurately reproduce the dynamic flow that is present in all great music.  Instead, it quickly became a \\"convenient\\" and \\"portable\\" medium, and was not used (much) to improve dynamic range.  The compression that had to be used on records to make them fit (on vinyl) was transferred, intact, to CDs.  Occasionally you will find artists and producers, like Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, who understand and exploit this aspect of digital, but generally it has become the norm to use a lot of compression- because it has a certain sound, the sound of pop music on the radio.<br /><br />Revolver, and I'll wager, all the rest of the Beatles remasters, is highly compressed.  Bummer.  Tomorrow Never Knows, Good Day Sunshine, And Your Bird Can Sing, Eleanor Rigby- should breathe with the dynamics of live performance.  Instead, they are crystal-clear but canned.  This a too bad.  The same team that did a great job on \\"Let It Be...naked,\\" which is a step in the right direction dynamically, did these remasters, but all they've achieved is to make them sound like first-press vinyl.  Again, there is nothing \\"wrong\\" with that, but it is so much less than it could be. They could have put us in the room with the Beatles.  Instead, here we are in 2009, listening the Beatles on the radio, the DJ spinning a very good pressing.  Just like old times.<br /><br />I compared the new Revolver's Eleanor Rigby with the 1999's Yellow Submarine Songtrack.  Yellow Sub is IT! The hidden secret of the Songtrack is that is a remix, as well a remaster.  And brother, it is WELL done, the gold standard for top-tier Beatles sonics.  The big question is:  W-T-F ???  Why didn't they remix the new series? The Eleanor Rigby from Yellow Sub is natural and full, voice and strings are balanced and sound like a live performance in an intimate recital hall.  The new Revolver version sounds forced and unnatural.  I think they are gonna hear from a lot audiophiles on this, and will catch holy hell.  At the least they should have lightened up on the compression.Rigby with the 1999's Yellow Submarine Songtrack.  Yellow Sub is IT!

My problem was that it tried so hard to remain true to such a vast comic and movie mythology, that it ended up not making sense at all. So...

It works, he survives, and so Deadpool gets created. So now Stryker wants to get rid of Logan, but he can't. All he can do is damage his brain with an adamantium bullet. Umm... hello?

I had terrific success with the chocolate cupcakes (super good, i highly recommend), but the vanilla were just okay (kind of grainy in texture and not very vanilla-y, but I'd try it again).  The main problem was the frosting.  The vanilla frosting just turned out runny and never really set up, the chocolate turned out fine (although due to the coconut oil I used, it tasted a lot like coconut with some chocolate favoring, but that was my fault).      I emailed Babycakes NYC asking about a possible misprint with the vanilla frosting recipe and any other errata, but never got a reply.  I did discover from their blog and other cooking blogs on the internets, that a LOT of people had problems with the vanilla frosting, plus other issues that i can't testify to, so beware.  I think its a good book and let's face it, vegan/gluten-free/sugar-free recipes can't be easy to develop, but definitely read the WHOLE recipe first and then do a google search - just in case other people had problems with that particular recipe.  After doing this, the vanilla frosting turned out just fine - it was reminiscent of a traditional cream cheese frosting, but one that didn't make my teeth hurt :)
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|My copy of the remastered Abbey Road just came in late yesterday.  I listened to it on my stereo system, then ripped a copy to my computer.  On my computer I then listened to the 1987 remaster, then the 2009 remaster.  The following are my conclusions.<br /><br />Overall there is an improvement in the sound.  The bass is a little more precise, the drums are crisper, the accoustic guitars ring more and the electric guitars have more crunch.  The biggest single improvement that I noted was in the organ and Moog work.  On I Want You the organ is more prominent and much more involved than in the original remaster, while the Moog really stands out to me in the songs Here Comes the Sun and in Maxwell's Silver Hammer.  The latter of which, while not really a song I care much about, feels much more whimsical and less annoying with this remaster, the Moog taking a more central part from the middle of the song onward.<br /><br />All that being said, I feel that this album gets the least overall from the remastering process.  This is most likely because it was the last one recorded, on the most modern (at the time) equipment.  If you have moderate to low end equipment, or you just want to listen to it on your iPod, keep the 1987 remaster and don't get this.  If you have moderate to high end equipment and like to sit back and LISTEN to the album for a listening experience, you'll enjoy this version.<br /><br />As far as the music itself, I feel that this is the Beatles' finest album and it shows nicely on this remaster.  Five stars.  Highest of recommendations.

0061134007|5.0|I am a therapist in part, because I love people's stories. It is an honor to be an intimate part of someones life struggles. This desire carries over into my theatre choices and my reading. I've discovered that mysteries written by writers from other countries tend to delve deeply into character. Another joy of reading foreign authors is that place becomes another finely detailed character. Reading mysteries chronologically beginning with the first introduction of the character is important. Unfortunately, the USA has not imported the first books by Jo Nesbo. So the series by this Norwegian author begins with The Redbreast. It was voted best norwegian crime novel ever.<br /><br />This series centers around Harry Hole who is brilliant, idiosyncratic, lovable and a massive alcoholic. My experience of many alcoholics is that this combination of traits is common. So Harry seems very real. I would suggest this series could be helpful to \\"experience\\" the process of getting sober and relapsing. The beginning of The Devil's Star (the 3rd in the USA) is tough to take because, very realistically, he is willing to lose his job and lovely girlfriend to his first priority the bottle. The author's official website opens with a glass of whiskey and two ice cubes circling together.<br /><br />These novels are very psychologically astute. Nemesis (the 2nd USA book) teaches about the manipulations of personality disorders and gets it right. There are the requisite twists and turns that keep the reader guessing. Harry Hole is so compelling that reading the novels one after another is a delight. I paid too much for the fourth book that won't be out until March in the USA that's how committed I am to this series.<br /><br />I think it's important for those who battle the disease of alcoholism to recognize they are worthwhile and lovable. I believe these books can be put to use in this cause. It's also possible that those who are in love with their alcoholic partners, sons and daughters, fathers and mothers will learn something from Harry about not taking things personally, because everything really is all about the self absorbed alcoholic.<br /><br />It's also easy to see the enabling by Harry's boss, who is at his wit's end by the beginning of the third book and has signed the papers to fire him. He wouldn't feel so bad about it if he went to a good Al-Anon meeting and learned about his codependency. Jo Nesbo creates a remarkably accurate picture of the self-destructiveness that goes along in part from carrying a huge burden of pain, too large for the alcoholic's soul. The author also portrays the obsessiveness that makes Harry an excellent detective and hard to live with. Alcohol is certainly a fast release from the grip of obsessiveness. Harry Hole is truly a three dimensional character who is worth your time.hers will learn something from Harry about not taking things personally, because everything really is all about the self absorbed alcoholic.

I pulled out my copy of Little Women, and the chapters in Good Wives are exactly the same as the second half of the book Little Women.  If that wasn't clear:  my copy (and every copy I remember) of Little Women contains \\"Part First\\" and \\"Part Second.\\"  GOOD WIVES = \\"Part Second.\\"  I can't think of any reason to buy this book.<br /><br />However, the book LITTLE WOMEN is great, and I can think of a million reasons to buy it!  (I hate giving anything Louisa May Alcott wrote only 2 stars--but those are for the packaging, not the text.)
0439023483|3.0|This book had me on the edge of my seat and I finished it in one day, but it was only after I put it down that I realized there were a lot of questions that went unanswered and a few writing techniques that annoyed me.    I really think this book could have been better if it was written in the third person. I rarely say that because I enjoy first person narration, but I think, for the type of book this was, third person would have been better. It would have given a more complete picture of this dystopian society. I had a hard time picturing exactly what it was like. I didn't really understand why the U.S. had devolved in the way it had aside from some random explanations like droughts and floods or whatever. It just wasn't enough. I had no idea where the districts were in relation to one another or why the Capitol was so worried about a rebellion. There just should've been more background information. Moreover, third person narration would've allowed the reader to find out more about the various characters and the contestants, but as it stands the reader is only really offered a glimpse into the main character and two other supporting characters. I think characterization could have been more developed.    The pacing in this book was great. I couldn't wait to find out what happens next. The ending was a little bit disappointing and like others have said, the rule changes at the last minute were annoying. This book reminded me a lot of gladiator battles in which the men were subject to all kinds of cruelty. The \\"muttations\\" reminded me of lions and tigers being brought into the arena during ancient Roman gladiator games.     Katniss is a pretty good character and it's nice to see a strong female even if she does have some masculine characteristics. I like Peeta's character a lot as well -- he is compassionate, intelligent and kind. I also found myself sympathizing with a lot of the other contestants just because I knew they were young and they were trying to survive as much as Peeta and Katniss. I would have loved a more deeper look into the lives of the other contestants. Honestly, this book is a bit macabre with all the young deaths. In the end, I was a little heartbroken over all the senseless violence. But if you think about it, there's senseless violence everywhere and I guess that's one of the commentaries this book is making.    All in all, a fun and gripping read, but it could have been so much better if it was a bit more descriptive regarding the society, the past, the characters, etc.
0743497465|1.0|This was the first Dan Brown book i ever picked up, after reading it i felt a great wave of depression. I wanted my money and time back after buying it and reading it. The plot is loose rip off Ice Station from Matthew Reilly a fantastic author. The twist at the end was ridiculous to say the least and made no sense.<br /><br />The book read like most of Dan 'thief' Brown works, microcosms of action with science fiction and historical fiction based in a present day scenario. These little sequences designed to keep the author reading without actually achieving anything whilst entertaining the reader with falsehoods of history and pseudoscience.<br /><br />If you enjoy reading good books stay away from Dan Brown, especially Deception Point - Worst book ever!

The movie was fantastic in an of itself, but the music truely brings it to life.     Although Jablonsky created nothing extremely memorable on this particular score, he is a master of the beats that make up the heart. Listening to this has provided me great daydreams and a fantastic musical experience! I simply love it! Everytime I want to listen to a score, my mind has subconsiously guided me toward this one--and I can't say I blame it.

1402527896|3.0|Firstly, let me say that if I were reviewing the book alone, it would likely get 5 stars. Maugham is a master of the human condition with all his contradictions and layers, particularly among expats and the aristocracy. His descriptions will make your nose bleed. While many reviews talk about the happy hippie among the ridiculous elitism and shallowness of expatriat Americans and British, I did not see the character in that light. To me simply swapped one culture for another, one status quo for another, in search of something that was his to make in the first place and thus was almost as tragic as the sticks in the mud that did find something, albeit something meaningless.  That said, Frank Muller's reading did this novel no justice. He read far too quickly in the beginning and slowed down later, which was refreshing in a way (I like to enjoy my books, not hit a deadline) but inconsistent. One of the biggest annoyances was that he ignored punctuation, one of the few tools a novelist has to tell you how to actually read the book. His forced Continental accent was awkwardly funny at best, though I believe he was entirely serious in putting it on. The narrator is supposed to be British, so I didn't understand why he chose such an accent, which really exists only in old movies and amateur theater and is horribly annoying in all respects. His British accent was nothing wonderful either (I doubt any Brit would mistake him for authentic). His tempo alternated among hurried, bored, jumpy and hiccupy. He often hurried through the text so much, he lost his breath. He put emphasis in inappropriate places for no apparent reason. He reminded me of a grammar school drama teacher, putting emphasis for the sake of emphasis and giving half hearted, ill considered accents simply to sound foreign. My eyebrows shot up when I read that he actually received awards for his readings. I can only assume this reading was a very large mistake, because I am not inclined to listen to his readings again.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|I got this last week and I can't stop listening to it, this is certainly much stronger then their last 6 albums or so, no filler track and all songs are almost equally strong. I'm not saying this after 1-2 listens, but after more then 30 listens.<br /><br />There's one semi ballad on this album which sounds like something from the system has failed era \\"tears in a vial\\" type, while the rest are ranging from thrash to up tempo stuff.  I wont spoil too much by describing all tracks one by one so you should just give it a listen then judge yourself, the only way I could see someone disliking this album is if they're 80's thrash purist.<br /><br />outstanding track : 1-11 (unless you think otherwise)

B0014Z4ON4|4.0|In this film, as compared to the previous one, we progress backward from 1936 to 1935. We move across the universe from Egypt to China and India. The team is reinforced with a nice little but strong Chinese boy. The film is absolutely packed with suspense and action, and yet the film is also packed with all kinds of interesting questions though it does not provide us with all the answers, far from it. At the beginning we have the Chinese mafia of this time but the film forgets to explain that this Chinese mafia is the result of the Opium war or wars, of the control of China by the English and other western countries, and that this mafia will be quite happy with the Japanese some years later. This quite one-sided vision seems to support the idea that in China the mafia controls everything, the police, the bars, drugs and opium, the government, you name it you have it. Then in India that poor Indiana discovers and dismantles a terroristic and fascist small potentate that imposes an extreme vision of Hinduism based on human sacrifice (God knows Spielberg makes us shiver in front of this horror), the legend of five miraculous stones that would give the Indians their power back against the English, the colonizing power, and these believers have to exploit children in mines in the worst possible way and with the most unimaginable violence (God knows Spielberg insists on the inhumanity of this crime against civilization). But this seems to imply that this Hinduism is producing that kind of sectarian and dictatorial vision and action. These people must be barbarians and that is purely racist somewhere (it is true Bush will come later with his war on terror that is implying the same thing about another religion), whereas the enlightened Americans are bringing freedom (God it is so true in Iraq and Afghanistan). These people eat insects, spiders and the fresh brain of monkeys, snakes and all kinds of nice juicy animals of that type. But the worst part is the role and function of the English in all that. Their representative is sharing these beautiful banquets with the local maharaja who is a child. Then they come nearly at the end to save the day that is mostly saved anyway, and they don't even use their guns because they use Indian soldiers to do the shooting. What's more these English-loving Indian soldiers have blue turbans, whereas the barbaric slave owners and exploiters have mainly red uniforms and turbans. These red and blue are not gratuitous. But no answer again and we cannot say that the worst violence and the worst massacres in India were done by turbaned Hindu extremists but rather by the very British colonizers. This film purports for the people who don't know history, which means the majority of the audience, that the evil of this world is not the colonizing western powers but extremist Hindus and Chinese Mafiosi. That is at least an extreme lie and an unacceptable disguise, not for truth that does not exist on such subjects, but for the slightest possible objectivity. Entertaining cannot mean conveying racist and western-centered prejudices. I am sure that Spielberg can do better and has done better than that.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGIDof the English in all that.

B002ELM5HY|5.0|\\"I'm writing too many songs, and then I have to put them out --- I'm sorry,\\" Mark Knopfler said at the start of what seems like our annual phone call.<br /><br />But if Knopfler is going to make CDs like 'Get Lucky', he can call me every few months --- these eleven songs are completely original short stories and character sketches, set against music by one of the planet's greater guitarists. That the quality is uniformly high is no surprise.<br /><br />What did take me aback --- and what will make fans of Dire Straits and Knopfler's previous solo releases shake their heads --- is that Knopfler seems to have assembled this CD without regard for the commercial marketplace. Nothing that says \\"automatic Top 10\\" jumps out at you like 'Punish the Monkey (Let the Organ Grinder Go)' from 'Kill to Get Crimson' or 'Boom Like That' from 'Shangri-La'.<br /><br />The likely result: The guy whose band sold 120 million records has made a CD that will be appreciated mostly by hardcore fans --- and the smallest cohort of music lovers: smart, literate grownups.<br /><br />An unwillingness --- or is it an inability? --- to compromise. A curiosity, at 60, about songwriting that explores new personal territory. A concern, in all things, for authenticity. You don't have to talk to Mark Knopfler long before you realize that these are bred in the bone. Listen:<br /><br />Jesse Kornbluth: Three words: Dire Straits reunion.<br /><br />Mark Knopfler (audible sigh): These days, it does seem to be the style. But putting the brakes on when I did [he disbanded Dire Straits in 1995] was right. I'm happy with the way things are.<br /><br />JK: We're talking about the easiest $300 million you'll ever make!<br /><br />MK: I'm looking to do more of what I do --- improve my recordings and playing the new music live, enjoying the variations that brings.<br /><br />JK: At a conference, I heard Steve Jobs quote The Beatles: \\"You and I have memories longer than the road that stretches out ahead.\\" I hear that idea running through your new CD. There's a lot of life experience --- people on the far side of young love, lost comrades, memories of a distant childhood.<br /><br />MK: The road ahead --- yes, it's a different picture. I have become a bit of a veteran at this music thing, so there's some of what made me. One song, 'Cleaning My Gun', is from the vet's viewpoint, the survivor's viewpoint. I've made a couple of notes where it's possible to tell you the background of some of the songs. But I try not to interfere too much or explain. I don't want to spoil the songs for you; I'd prefer that it's going to be what you want it to be.<br /><br />JK: In 'Remembrance Day', you sing the names of those --- war dead, it seems --- now under the \\"earthen roof\\". Are they men you knew?<br /><br />MK: It's just a list of boys. It begins with a cricket team. In a lot of communities, cricket teams and football teams --- and in America, baseball teams --- were the kids who went to war.<br /><br />JK: That's the closest you come to social criticism on this CD. There's no wry, angry song like \\"Punish the Monkey\\". Is Knopfler mellowing?<br /><br />MK: The older I get, the more grouchy I become. I have some equally disagreeable friends who are walking partners with me in the morning. We get most of our bile out then. By the time I get home, I feel better.<br /><br />JK: I think of a Bruce Springsteen CD that, according to his manager, had no obvious hit single. Bruce went home and dashed off 'Dancing in the Dark'. And the entire world bought 'Born in the USA'. In contrast, I fear that 'Get Lucky' will be under-appreciated because it's merely gorgeous.<br /><br />MK: It does occur to me I need to have someone like that.<br /><br />JK: I see you have one concert scheduled this month --- then your schedule looks blank until May of 2010. This can't be.<br /><br />MK: I'm trying to work out a way to pop over to America and do Prairie Home Companion or Letterman, just by myself. And there will be a tour from April to July.<br /><br />JK: Didn't Dire Straits once do 250 concerts in a year?<br /><br />MK: When you're young and in a band, it's like you have a football under your arm ---- you're running. But some of that is running away.<br /><br />JK: Fender has just launched the Mark Knopfler Stratocaster. Do you use it or just endorse it?<br /><br />MK: I play it on stage instead of my old one.

1583762027|2.0|The book's cover was in good shape, but there was writing and underlining in pen through about 15+ pages.  This would have easily been seen by the merchant.  I am dissapointed that this was not represented in the description.  Will be leary of buying from this merchant in the future.
0385504225|3.0|May I echo what many other reviewers have said? The plot of this story seemed to be a much-watered down version on the others in the Langdon series, the description at times repetitive and laboursome and the 'twist' unsatisfying. Yet I still enjoyed reading, but probably more so for the pleasure of the historical aspects of the novel, the descriptions of DC and the info about the founders of the US than for the story. Of course part of the problem was over-anticipation, that which you wait for and idolise in the mind often does not live up to expectations.

1594202249|5.0|Pynchon is one of my favorite authors and so to me any release by him is a Big Deal.  Thus it was a bit of a surprise by me how little known this novel seemed upon publishing, the local large chain bookstore had it basically hidden on the lower level of the front display, to the point where the clerk even had to do some searching for it.  Maybe people are fooled by the cover in thinking that it's just another beach read detective story, meant to wile away the hours whilst one relaxes on the sand, secure in the knowledge that their brain won't be taxed too much.<br /><br />Alas, those people are going to be disappointed and slightly confused if they're at all paying attention.<br /><br />As numerous others have pointed out, Pynchon has tended to alternate the shorter, more relaxed novels with the gigantic works of Serious Importance.  Thus, almost as a reward for making it through all thousand dense pages of \\"Against the Day\\", we get this novel, which is so light by comparison that there hardly seems to be any weight to it at all.<br /><br />But the key phrase here is \\"by comparison\\" . . . next to the last novel, neutron stars might appear to be somewhat lightweight and the sudden shift back to fiction that most of us mortals can grasp is a welcome change.  Set in the sixties, it at first seems relatively straightforward as \\"Doc\\" Sportello takes on a case brought up by an ex-girlfriend about the disappearance of her current boyfriend.  Sportello, a hippie in LA during the heyday of the hippies, is unlike a lot of Pynchon characters in that while he's confused and pulled by forces that lurk just out of reach, he's also capable on his own, putting pieces together (sometimes with the help of illegal substances) almost as much as people start pulling fast ones on him.  It's his view of the sixties and his seeming ability to exist safely at nearly all levels of it that informs the novel, as he moves from the scoured underbelly of the city to the LAPD where things aren't much cleaner.<br /><br />Being that this is a Pynchon novel, things don't stay simple for long and you don't summarize or fathom the plot as much as letting yourself by yanked along by it, as conspiracies blossom from unexpected woodwork and wrinkles abound as disappearances wind up not being just disappearances, as mysterous entities that may or may not exist appear to be controlling everything, or nothing and people scurry about at the mercy of it all.  Or maybe not.  Maybe they're just being paranoid.<br /><br />What makes this so readable is how closely Pynchon hews to being a fairly straightforward detective story while mainitaining his own style.  Doc may be going through the motions of a Chandler novel but the rhythms and the prose and the underlying concerns are definitely Pynchon's, the sudden departures into topics that are erudite (the nascent origins of the Internet) or not so much (surf-rock), stringing it all together into a tapestry that for all its contrivances actually feels more real than the actual sixties do, the different portions of the city and the era interlocking and slowly gravitating toward being at each other's throats, embodied best in the relationship between Doc and cop foil Bigfoot . . . they may not like each other much but without the other's insights they would have an incomplete understanding of the times.<br /><br />There's a playfulness present here that most of his novels don't have, or that aren't as obvious.  Maybe it's the setting, maybe it's Pynchon consciously trying to not scare off any potential readers, but for once his people really feel like people and there's a humanity present that we haven't seen since \\"Mason & Dixon\\" (\\"Against the Day\\" for all its pleasures, also felt curiously detached at times), in the attention paid to even the smallest problems, the compassion that doesn't feel forced, the sense of loss that these maybe-not-phantom conspiracies bring about and the toll it takes on the people involved.<br /><br/>It winds up being a romp and an elegy for the sixties, with the paranoia always present in Pynchon's works never really going away, no matter how light things get, coming out in unguarded moments, when the drugs don't work or they do their work too well, the sense of a system coming down to lock us all into its gears and all you can do is either get out of the way for a time or resign yourself to be immeshed in its gears.  Sportello weaves his way through a breakneck landscape (there's even time for an action scene!) of characters and plots consisting of elements trying to shape a future that is more than willing to shape them.  There's no avoiding it.<br /><br />I didn't think Pynchon could ever write a \\"page-turner\\" but this pretty much qualifies and while it doesn't totally prep someone for the intricacies and obsessions writ large of the more substantial works, it's as much as an introductory primer for the man as we'll probably ever get.with the paranoia always present in Pynchon's works never really going away, no matter how light things get, coming out in unguarded moments, when the drugs don't work or they do their work too well, the sense of a system coming down to lock us all into its gears and all you can do is either get out of the way for a time or resign yourself to be immeshed in its gears.

B002GZQYMK|4.0|No matter if you are a veteran fan since Muse's debut album Showbiz in 1999, or The Resistance is your first taste of Muse, you will definitely find something to like about this album. The Resistance departs from the musical flavor we have seen over the past few years from this bombastic band. If Muse's history of sound and styling were a book, and every album a chapter within the book, The Resistance would be a major plot twist.     #1 \\"Uprising\\"   Unlike previous albums' openings that begin slowly and build to crescendo, The Resistance kicks right into high gear with \\"Uprising\\". This is one of a few songs on the album that has been criticized by veteran fans for sounding too \\"poppy\\".  The vocals are strong, the rhythm is forceful, and the lyrics are Muse's same brand of \\"Conspiracy's in the air\\", although some will find the lyrics somewhat clichéd on this particular song.    #2 \\"Resistance\\"   Brilliant track. I think listeners will enjoy this song regardless of how familiar they are with the Muse discography. Lilting verses with a soaring chorus. Vocals and measure are juxtaposed to create a beautiful piece.    #3 \\"Undisclosed Desires\\"   This is a good track. That being said, what the hell was Muse thinking when they included this song on the album? This track is like a disfigured puzzle piece that does not seem to fit into the discography of Muse. \\"Undisclosed Desires\\" seems like a concept that would be discussed in the studio in a \\"I wonder what this might sound like\\" context. But why this track even reached the mixing stage of production is beyond me.     #4 \\"United States of Eurasia/Collateral Damage\\"   Listening to this track is like looking at a piece of modern art; it has the feel of masterpiece, but it is just so ridiculous that it is laughable. Some are already calling this song a cheap rip-off of Queen. But anyone who makes this accusation is only proving that their familiarity with the works of Queen ends with \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\". This track continuesthe lyrical milieu of conspiracy and closes with a beautiful interpretation of Chopin's Nocturne in E-flat.     #5 \\"Guiding Light\\"   Much of the inspiration for this song came from U2. This is a beautiful, flowing song with a short guitar piece toward the end that puts the icing on the cake. This track will undoubtedly become a favorite for arenas/stadiums.    #6 \\"Unnatural Selection\\"   Spectacular. This is the heaviest track on the album. Opening with pipe organs and soft Bellamy vocals before lifting off the ground with an entourage of high speed Manson chords. This song rocks hard and has a solid guitar solo toward the end.     #7 \\"MK Ultra\\"   The album keeps the momentum going with \\"MK Ultra\\". High energy through passionate vocals and intense guitar help to make this track not just a superior piece of rock, but an impressive bit of technical complexity.    #8 \\"I Belong to You [+Mon Coeur S'Ouvre A Ta Voix]\\"   Muse has stepped out on a limb with this track, not just lyrically, but musically as well. And the result is a beautiful song laced with love, lust, and tenderness. Some have compared the sound of this track to that of Maroon 5, and I guess that is not too much of a stretch.    #9 - 11 \\"Exogenesis\\"   This piece steps above the standard of modern music entirely. Matthew Bellamy has successfully blended orchestral concepts of old with modern technology and technique. Muse is navigating uncharted waters with this amazing work of art. I am convinced that Matthew Bellamy wants nothing less than to have his name written into rock history amongst the greats, and \\"Exogenesis\\" is yet another step that he has taken in that direction.

B002CMLIJ6|5.0|My hubby and I saw this on the same day that we saw \\"Star Trek\\" in the theater - we watched \\"Wolverine\\" first, and then we saw \\"Star Trek\\" - and I was MUCH more impressed by this film!  (NOT that I'm comparing \\"Origins\\" with \\"Star Trek\\" - they're obviously 2 totally different films - but I was completely pumped up after leaving the \\"X-Men\\" theater, and then was fairly quickly deflated once I settled into \\"Star Trek.\\")  Anyway, if you want a major adrenaline rush; if you want really awesome special effects and stunts; and most importantly, if you want some honest and fantastic acting, then \\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\" is the flick for you.    Returning as the title character, Hugh Jackman is amazing (no surprise there!), and I love how the story really does focus on his beginnings and what made him who he is.  (I read at least one other review on here that said the story didn't deal too much with his origins; don't know where that reviewer got that idea?!?  Were we watching the same movie??)  I was also blown away by Liev Schreiber's performance as Victor Creed, Logan's brother, because he brought a scary sense of reality to his character's ever-increasing rage and ferocity.  The rest of the supporting cast was great, as well, especially Taylor Kitsch (of \\"Friday Nights\\" fame) as Gambit.  I certainly hope to see him in more big feature films.    At any rate, go buy (or, at least, rent) this film!!  You won't be disappointed!......I can't wait to get my copy in the mail any day now. :)
B002GZQYMK|4.0|First off, I should mention that I come from the side of Black Holes and Revelations being the best Muse album up to this point.  There is a lot of discussion how The Resistance is a different sound for Muse but after a half dozen listens, I find it as more of an evolution or maturation of a sound that started with Black Holes and Revelations.  The Resistance feels like it could feel the same mold, but lyrically it is well advanced beyond that.<br /><br />The album find Muse taking a more serious approach to their music with political themes that can be seen as targeting the current world state of affairs.  Yet, as a Muse album, one can still see the side that throws fun, over-the-top music and style into its songs.  This is probably best illustrated by the song \\"The United States of Eurasia\\". There is an underlying political message that is masked by the fun of the sound that is strangely similar to Queen in Bohemian Rhapsody.<br /><br />In fact, you find a similar condition in each song on the album, and it really makes this album stand apart rather than amongst or behind others that tackle serious themes.  Too often, albums blatantly state the criticism of politics or current events like a war, but the best music doesn't need to state the obvious.  In fact, an enduring piece of music will leave it just a bit vague as that is the type of music that will be relevant in years to come when similar wars or political situations develop.  A subtle message is wonderful, and it is what really makes this Muse album grand.<br /><br />The only knock I give on this album is that the sound hasn't really evolved enough from Black Holes and Revelations to really make this album stand apart from its predecessor.  Lyrically, it does, and there are some great elements to the music such as the 3 part symphony at the end and the piano interludes Matthew Belamy throws in here and there, but there were similar elements in the previous album. However, I do find that the unity of the album as a whole and the layers of sound keep growing on me, and in a few weeks time, I may actually think this is Muse's masterpiece.<br /><br />In the end, I think that if you are a fan of Black Holes and Revelations, you'll love the Resistance.  If you are a fan of albums previous to that, you still might enjoy it.  Lyrically the Resistance is a step up and in a similar vein with Absolution, but if you are a fan of those earlier albums, you just might not find it reaching that level in your ear.  Then again, if you are a listener that likes a challenge, you'll probably find it a joy to listen to after a few tries whether or not you think it is Muse's masterpiece.e layers of sound keep growing on me, and in a few weeks time, I may actually think this is Muse's masterpiece.

B001N26GFC|5.0|I saw this in the theater, on a weekday matin&eacute;e when there was one other patron, a middle-aged lady sitting across the aisle from me who kept dropping things loudly. Somehow this added to the experience of the film, which is about a positively positive young woman, Poppy (Sally Hawkins, just brilliant) who just won't let anything stand in her way of enjoying her life and loving everyone in it as much as she can -- until she meets her anti-human match in Scott (Eric Marsan), a frighteningly angry, racist and sexist driving instructor who probably ought to be locked up, or at least not having such contact with the general public. Poppy's a working class girl in Mike Leigh's modern-day London, and that means full of quirks and foibles and not in the least bit glamorous or obvious; much of the charm in the film as in most of the Leigh films I've seen is in not knowing what's going to come next, except that it will be unusual -- but never untrue.<br /><br />Poppy has a couple of sisters, a best friend, and the beginnings of a relationship to contend with along with her crazy driver training class (necessitated by the theft of her bike through typical carelessness in the first scene) and she navigates all of them with her chin up -- though never with her brain turned off. I'm sure there are some who will be very irritated with this blast of sun through the rainbow, but speaking as a depressive who typically hates Pollyanna characters -- I just loved her - and the film.<br /><br />At the end, when Poppy and Scott have hit a point of no return, my emotions really went through the ringer - and I think I started to see what Poppy was missing, and that perhaps she knew that she was missing it. Her failure to understand misery is in some ways just as limiting to her understanding of other people and the world as Scott's inability to ever forget it, though it's much less destructive. As she goes for a boat ride I'm reminded of Jacques Rivette's \\"Celine and Julie Go Boating\\", a fantasy different in almost every respect from this dose of hard reality and broad humor - but I think that Poppy, like the characters in that film, knows that she's in some ways living in a fantasy world of her own making. And maybe, given some of the alternatives, that's not such an awful thing.t in almost every respect from this dose of hard reality and broad humor - but I think that Poppy, like the characters in that film, knows that she's in some ways living in a fantasy world of her own making.

B000FC12C8|5.0|This is the single best book on investing and I've read at least 20 books on the topic. It's impressive to see someone make predictions in a book written decades ago that still hold. Most authors either avoid predictions or rapidly go out of date. The 'new' commentary diluted the quality of the book, the additional author isn't bad, but it's always going to be a disappointment to go from a rock star author to commentary from more of a backing singer.    If you invest your own money, I'll be surprised if you don't get sufficient insight from this book that it pays for itself many times over.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|The other reviews have outlined the greatness of this album in detail, so I won't bother to do that.    However, I just have to throw another good review in there just to keep their track record going strong.  This album is a beauty.  I have yet to see another group who can create so much fun and meaning with the brilliant instrumentation and musicality that Muse brings to everything they do.  I am thrilled and proud to be a fan!      I can't wait until they come back to North America on a tour.  If you enjoy the studio recordings, you'll LOVE the live shows.
B002GZQYMK|4.0|\\"Fight The Power\\" is the theme to the new Muse album, the set that should finally make the superstars in the USA. Matt Bellamy and crew have delivered on the promise of their deliriously cool [[ASIN:B000FVQYYK Black Holes and Revelations]], opting to strike with the old fashioned concept album.<br /><br />Our hero of \\"The Resistance\\" starts off the album shouting \\"They will not control us! We will be victorious\\" to a very [[ASIN:B00009ILC4 We Will Rock You Theatrical]] beat during \\"Uprising.\\" He rages against the machine and wonders if it's all worth it without love (the title track) before giving in to love (\\"I want to reconcile the violence in your heart,\\" he coos) on \\"Undisclosed Desires.\\" You likely know where all this is headed, but you'll still be surprised. There's plenty of defiant cries like \\"I want the truth!\\" or \\"I've traveled half the world to say I love you.\\" sprinkled throughout \\"The Resistance,\\" yet Muse makes it all sound fresh and fun again.<br /><br />But then there's the coup d'grace. The three part mini-symphony \\"Exogenesis\\" would do proud by both [[ASIN:B00007KWHN Yes]] or [[ASIN:B0002M5U88 Queen]] or even [[ASIN:B000NVL9FQ Emerson, Lake & Palmer]]. Rich on the Mozart and the prog, this just pushes Muse into a whole new world. Bellamy, bassist and backing vocalist Christopher Wolstenholme and drummer Dominic Howard can now soar as high as they'd like. \\"The Resistance\\" is the mark of a band that refuses to set limits; Muse are capably now blending rock, funk, progressive, alternative and classical in the scope of one CD. You can't fight it.

B000JQU4TW|4.0|Initially heavy on witty dialogue and light on plot, but it gets there in the second half and is a clever story. You can't flick between chapters as you can with other Kindle publications.
B001GCUO16|3.0|This movie felt very unfinished. It almost feels as if the producers and director were trying really hard, the movie leaked onto the internet and they just decided \\"[...]!! Release it as is.\\" That being said I was hoping for an Unrated Director's Cut but it doesn't look like that is going to happen. Ultimately for a movie about one of the most violent and 'clawed'X'Men, this movie was too PG-13. There was a lot of \\"violence innuendo\\" but very little actual violence. The game on the other hand had dialog that was pretty much the same as this movie, (not very good) but there were more story points and the story was more enticing. More importantly the game was a Mature rated bloodbath of wolverine goodness. Imagine God of War with X-Men. My advise if you have already seen this movie play the game. If you have not seen the movie you can watch it if you want as it is a decent action movie (just not a very good Wolverine Movie) but then play the game.     P.S. The game is the \\"Uncaged Edition\\" available on PS3 and Xbox 360, avoid the POS Wii, PS2 and PSP versions at all costs!!

B00127RAJY|4.0|I have only done this video once, but I plan on doing it every other day! The lunges were a killer for me for some reason.  My legs wouldn't stop shaking! The only thing that bothered me about this video so far is that there was little to no stretching of the calves on level one.  I had to compensate for that. Now the day after, they are killing me, but in a good way!    I am training to walk a 1/2 marathon in November. Before I started this video I was walking a lot and on every Saturday I'd walk one mile more than I did the previous weekend. I didn't feel a change in my body from the walking, nor did I see one. I also didn't feel that my endurance was working for me.  So, I decided to try a different approach. Mon, Wed, & Fri I would do this Shred workout. A friend suggested it to me and told me how challenging it was. Then on Tue & Thurs, I would do the \\"Crunch: Fat Burning Pilates.\\" I found out today that they are nice compliments for each other. With Jillian I didn't feel as though my glutes were addressed. The Pilates video makes up for that nicely. Last but not least Wed. & Fri I walk 2 quick miles and do my endurance walk on Saturday.  I will try and get back to this post to tell you if I see improvements in my endurance or my body.    My friend told me that your muscles will feel realy tight after doing the Shred, so I also ordered a yoga video to help with flexability.
B001PPGAIA|3.0|The Bottom Line:    Australia makes an appealingly quirky 85 minute movie, as Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman team up to drive their cows to Darwin, but then unfortunately there's still 80 more minutes before the movie ends; it samples various subplots (The Japanese attack! Well-meaning but out-of-place criticism of Australia's treatment of its native peoples!) without ever finding a narrative thrust to match its first half, and all the well-shot scenes of carnage and destruction can't change the fact that this is one big jumbled mess of a film.    2.5/4

B0029NY9YO|2.0|I have to admit that it's hard to love the movie Watchmen. In my opinion, it's not as great as I had hoped. The only good things about this are the fantastic action and visuals. The fascinating character of Rorschach is also a welcome addition. But sadly, everything else doesn't add up. The characters aren't fully fleshed out (even the flashbacks aren't enough). The script needed some improvements (there were some silly dialogue here and there). Malin Akerman and Matthew Goode were horrible in this movie (couldn't they have at least tried?). Of course, it's just my opinion. It's fine my me if you love Watchmen. But to me, this didn't keep me interested. I give it a D instead of an F, mainly because of Rorschach and the special effects.

B000MR9D5E|4.0|Planet Earth does present the most extraordinary visual imagery we've ever seen.  Truly superlative!  Unfortunately, the narrator's voice quality and accent require us to strain, at times, to follow him.  Thus, the 4 stars instead of 5.  Note to parents:  this is not a Bambi-Disneyfied production.  In almost every segment, some old or weak animal gets eaten by its natural predator.  Welcome to the food chain.  If you are hoping to see peace throughout the world in the animal kingdom, you'll have to buy Disney, instead.  The reality, which they capture incredibly, is that everything needs lunch, and they are not all vegetarians.  This should be a part of every educated family's library.

1594202249|4.0|I recently attended an author function where someone wanted to know if anyone had read Thomas Pynchon's new book yet. Only one person at that point had; when asked how it was, the gentleman wiggled his eyebrows, touched his forefinger to his thumb, and brought it to his lips and inhaled. Everyone there laughed; they knew exactly what he meant, from prior experience with Pynchon.    Indeed, reading INHERENT VICE is a psychedelic experience, from both a topical and intellectual standpoint. It is Pynchon's most coherent and linear work since THE CRYING OF LOT 49, and utilizes many of the same elements to propel its narration, not the least of which are sex, drugs and rock `n' roll. It is also a pastiche, parody and tribute to the detective novel. Pynchon takes the characteristic strengths and weaknesses of the genre --- unusual characters, occasionally contrived coincidences, complex plots --- and exaggerate them to the extent that reading the book is at times akin to reading a pool of milk, but an extremely interesting pool of milk.    A private detective is at the heart of any mystery novel worthy of the name, and indeed, INHERENT VICE has one in the form of Doc Sportello, who serves as the reader's guide through the drug-laden streets of Los Angeles, circa 1970. Doc spends a good portion of the novel under the influence of controlled substances, resulting in his involvement in situations that coherent thinking would dictate he avoid. The ball starts rolling when Shasta, Doc's ex-girlfriend, asks him to investigate a possible plot against Mickey Wolfmann, a real estate magnate and Shasta's current love interest, which is being hatched by Mickey's wife and her boyfriend. At about the same time, Doc is retained by a black militant to locate a prison friend of his who is in the Aryan Brotherhood, and is also hired to find a local musician who supposedly died of a drug overdose. Of course all of these investigations quickly intersect, the nexus being the Golden Fang, which may or may not be a mysterious smuggling boat, an assassin's guild, a dentist's investment group, or something else.    As one might expect, Pynchon's trademarks are all present, and in spades. Hordes of characters, important or otherwise, wander on and off the page. Names of people, groups, fictional places and objects are oddly and occasionally hysterically named (a fictional British rock band bearing the name \\"Spotted Dick\\" continued to be funny for some reason right through to the end of the book). Perhaps most significantly, however, Pynchon continues to toss off intermittently brilliant passages that ironically seem to manifest themselves just when the reader's attention starts to wander, and in unlikely places to boot. This is especially true of the first and last third of the book. And then there are the objects that seem to populate every page, walking on, performing a bow, and then disappearing forever. A Las Vegas antique dealer, for example, has for sale a number of remarkable artifacts, including a decorative ashtray from the Sands \\"once thrown up into by Joey Bishop.\\"    Pynchon is one of those authors who is perhaps more widely known than widely read. His work comes wrapped in a density that is challenging to break through, while the length of a number of his novels has been somewhat daunting as well. INHERENT VICE is (relatively) short and set in a place and time that is somewhat readily identifiable, wrapped in a genre that is familiar and, in this case, somewhat accessible. While one does not have to be under the influence to follow the proceedings that take place, those who are past or present imbibers will nod knowingly in spots. Does it work as a detective novel? Not exactly. But if you have been tempted to read a Pynchon book in the past but put it off for any number of reasons, INHERENT VICE would be the place to start.        --- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub
1448649005|5.0|What amazed me was the fact that this was much more than I expected.  I had never read this book unitl now, and I was poorer for not reading it.  Shelly's book was a much fuller, longer, and better story then what I remember seeing in films and what is referred about in other stories.<br /><br />I found myself understanding why it was such a popular and important story, that created an entire 'type' of films and stories, I've even used the world Frankenfoods to describe some of the new GMF that are being created in a lab, and until now did not know the origional story that lead to the word Frankenstein.<br /><br />Most of us know that Frankenstein was the creator, and not the monster, but no one remembers.  In the story, which is very good, powerful and full of portents, we learn that the moster grows, and follows Victor all over the world!  This is a full, and very worthwhile read!<br /><br />Enjoy it!

The movie had a good story, and the 3-D effects on the HD were great. 3-D is always better on HD. I had one little gripe. The 3-D glasses were too small for my head, and I wear glasses which makes things more difficult. The glasses should be bigger, or they should include a larger set as well.

It plays fine on everything I need it to, but if you have troubles with DVD-R's you may run into issues.    As for the /content/ of the disks - I first saw Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog on Hulu and it kept me coming back to watch it over and over. It is utter brilliance.    In shrink-wrap.

Some of his best songs are here : \\"Blowin' in the wind\\", of course, but also \\"Girl from the north country\\", \\"A hard rain's a gonna fall\\", \\"Don't think twice, it's all right\\", \\"Corrina, Corrina\\"...  Actually everything deserves to be heard.  At the time this record was made,DYLAN was nearly 22 years, and he was singing only with his guitar and his harmonica.  The words of his songs were as deep as those of a writer's first novel.  If you only have a single record of Bob DYLAN to buy, trust me,this is THE ONE.
0618918248|1.0|For every atheist looking for someone to reaffirm their belief in no God, this is your guy. It is really sad that people have gone to such lengths to turn away from their creator. Admitting to a creator God, would be acknowledging the fact we are responsible to that creator. An atheist does not wish that. Since Dawkins does not even understand Christianity, his arguments are worthless. Enjoy your godless lives down here while you can, I guess. Better, yet, accept God's FREE gift of salvation. It's NEVER too late.
1448648440|5.0|Reading Howards End, with its message of 'Only Connect' caused me to wonder what he would think of this world of instant messaging, of twit-er, that diaries have turned into blogs read and shared by all, that people actually record and think that a friend means something to do with Facebook, and not real life?     This is why books like this need to be read.  Even just watch the film - at least to be thinking about the subject....    One of the best books written, sad, funny, worthy, and wonderful, a book crying out for all of us.  Not crying out to be read, but crying for us.    Read it and see why.

0312370849|5.0|This book was highly recommended to me and at first not sure of why nor of its contents. I am a WWII history buff and thoroughly enjoyed the journaling of Julia and her deep desire to reach the conclusions of Sarah's story. Throughout the book, the history of the rounding up of the Jews in France in 1942 was appalling. It is time that we all acknowledge the treason that the French police implemented towards their own countryman whether Jewish or otherwise. The story is very captivating and truly worthwhile. I highly recommended this book to a lady that was in the bookstore in the San Diego Airport. I'm a church librarian and have a great love of books and history. I gently asked \\"are you looking for recommendations\\". She took my advice and bought Sarah's Key. She said she didn't want to \\"cry\\", but I said it was very sad time in our history. Question: were the French police held responsible for the deaths of the Jews in France? Yes, they had their orders, but so were the Nazi police in Germany and eventual trials. The back of the the book offers other suggestions. I also highly recommend Trudy's Promise which shares the time of occupation after the Berlin Wall was erected. Blessed reading.

Highly highly recommended to anyone who has little, or any age really, kids who like to listen to stories.
B000ZEE3I6|1.0|The other Potter films told the story badly. THIS one didn't tell the story at ALL. Watching it is like watching a series of random, animated book illustrations. Oh, here's the scene where Slughorn is introduced, here's a scene where some black chick hits on Harry Potter, here's the scene where Ron sucks at Quiddich, here's the scene where Hermione has her feelings hurt for some reason, here's the scene where Dumbledore sets fire to a bunch of zombies, and now Dumbledore is d- I mean, incapacitated. (No spoilers!)<br /><br />I read the Harry Potter books, and I remember the story. When I see a movie adaptation of a book, I expect to see a story reproduced in movie form. Yeah, maybe the movie's story will not be exactly the same as books story, and maybe the movie will not be as good as the book; but, at the very least, I expect it to be, oh, you know, A MOVIE, with a plot and everything. I don't want to see a character simply walk onto the set, announce that he's Snape, and act out a few random Snape scenes. If I wanted to see a bunch of disconnected characters jumbled together I'd go to a Harry Potter convention or something.<br /><br />Oh, and by the way, all of these moving illustrations are pretty ugly. You know, just because this movie is supposed to be \\"darker\\" than past wizard movies, doesn't mean they have to literally film it in black and white, and design the set to look as soul-sucking as possible. Oddly enough, there's actually a scene where Harry Potter stands in front of Hogwarts, which now looks like the bleakest place on earth, and says, \\"I forgot how beautiful this place is.\\" Pffft. Why can't he see the irony?<br /><br />After I saw this movie I complained the about the bad writing to someone who saw the movie, but never read the book. She claimed I was being too hard on it, she claimed she understood the plot perfectly. So, I asked her who the Half-Blood Prince was. Her response? \\"Oh, I thought they were going to explain that in the next movie.\\"
0689865384|4.0|Tally Youngblood is anxiously awaiting her sixteenth birthday. Why? Well once she turns sixteen she will be reunited with her BFF Peris, but more importantly than that, she will finally be pretty. That's right, at the moment, Tally is living amongst the Uglies.<br /><br />\\"Uglies\\" is set in a post-apocalyptic world where a mysterious global catastrophe has pretty much wiped out most of the planet as well as its inhabitants. Several hundred years later, the survivors (or at this point generations later) fearful of war and violence - now cities are known as independent states. These cities have agreed to certain standards for the greater good. For instance at the age of sixteen you undergo major plastic surgery and are moved to new living quarters in a town known as, you guessed it, \\"Prettytown\\" - where you live it up with other pretties just like you - partying and just having a grand ol' time.<br /><br />A couple of months prior to their sixteenth birthday, Tally meets Shay. They become fast friends and tend to hang out and play tricks together. But after several weeks Tally realizes that there's something different about Shay. For one, she doesn't want to be pretty, she actually thinks she's not ugly. Which to Tally is quite surprising since everyone knows you are ugly before the operation. Secondly, she keeps talking about a secretive place called the Smoke and a mysterious friend named David. Shay eventually runs away to the Smoke the day before her sixteenth birthday leaving Tally behind with a set of cryptic directions in case she decides to forgo her dream of being pretty. But Tally has no intention of running away - her dream has always been to be pretty. That is until Special Circumstances (an organization like the FBI) gets involved and gives her the ultimatum of being pretty or staying ugly forever but in the process she'll have to betray her friend and all the inhabitants of the Smoke. That is, of course, if she can decipher Shay's directions and makes it there alive.<br /><br />Although I did find it a bit difficult at first to understand what was going on, once I actually started understanding about pretties, uglies, etc., I really enjoyed this dystopian future. I love anything post-apocalyptic - and reading about a world where technology surpasses ours, where there's a magnetic grid running beneath the surface that allows the residents to travel via hoverboards and/or hovercrafts, is a treat. I liked the fact that it had an underlying thread about recycling and taking care of our planet. And like most teens today - Tally and Shay were facing some of the same issues - low self-esteem, peer pressure, etc. I loved when they would mention the Rusty's (the people who were living before the big catastrophe... or us). It was a mystery that little by little unraveled itself on what and why the world was the way it is in their time. I will forewarn that it ends rather abrubtly, but do not fret as there is a sequel.<br /><br />With that said, although a bit confusing at first, stick through the first couple of chapters and you will find yourself completely immersed in a unique world full adventure, suspense and even a little romance thrown in there for good measure.Although I did find it a bit difficult at first to understand what was going on, once I actually started understanding about pretties, uglies, etc., I really enjoyed this dystopian future.

B00004X01U|5.0|i remember back in 2000, i was highly anticipating for the birth of her 2nd son and her next album. Ray of Light was my very first Madonna cd and I had enjoyed it alot. Music had the same electronic sounds like Ray of Light but this time she worked with Mirwais.<br /><br />1. Music-i remember hearing that song on the radio. i remember watching the video as well but i didn't like the stripper part at the end. anyways, the lyrics are just memorable and catchy. \\"music makes the people come together...yea..music makes the bouregaise and the rebel...yea.\\" i never knew that \\"hey mr dj, put a record on. i wanna dance with my baby\\" was madonnna.  5/5<br /><br />2. Impressive Instant-this song reminds me of early madonna. i just love the part where she says \\"i like to singy singy..like a bird on a wingy wingy...i like to rhumba rhumba rhumba...let's do the samba samba samba\\". classic. 5/5<br /><br />3. Runaway Lover-great dance track.  5/5<br /><br />4. I Deserve It-this song sounds so red hot chili peppers like. i like it. 5/5<br /><br />5. Amazing-this is my favorite song on the album. it's a pity she didn't get to release it off the album. it's like beautiful stranger pt.2. 5/5<br /><br />6. Nobody's Perfect-very interesting, eccentric sounds in the background. it kinda sounds like a cat. lol. i love the lyrics, yea. 4.5/5<br /><br />7. Don't Tell Me-i love this song!!! \\"don't you ever tell me love isn't real..it's just something that we do\\". this song kicks ass!!! it has this don't mess with me attitude. and the video was cool too. 5/5<br /><br />8.

015626224X|5.0|Gritty realism.<br /><br />This is one of Orwell's three great travel journalism books. \\"Homage to Catalona,\\" and \\"Road to Wigan Pier\\" being the other two. These three books are his greatest works; they identify Orwell's journalistic genius. This book was written at the encouragement or possible coercion of his publisher and has a history similar to \\"The Road To Wigan Pier.\\" Do not forget the source material for this book when reading it.<br /><br />The source material for this book can be found in \\"In an Age Like This\\" with its journals on poverty in London and Paris written in the twenties and thirties. One interesting essay, \\"How the Poor Die\\" was written much later and appears in \\"In Front of Your Nose\\"- the fourth of the four volume series edited by his last wife Sonia Orwell.<br /><br />Written after WWII, \\"How the Poor Die\\" recounts his stay in an unnamed Paris charity hospital during his youth as a dishwasher during the period covered by \\"Down and Out in Paris and London.\\" Morbid reading. Orwell had chronic lung problems, and describes in his essay what it was like becoming an anatomical subject for french medical students under early welfare state medicine.<br /><br />Read the source material for this book to get a richer Orwell experience!

He got several Star Wars toys at his birthday party but this was the biggest hit.  After everything was opened he sat in a chair reading this book and passing it around to everyone at his party. We have two other pop up books - Dinosaur and Shark that are great too.  The pop ups are intricate and amazing, and the text is interesting enough to make a 9 year old want to sit and read. Great gift if you don't know what toys a child (or grownup) has, or if you are one of those who like the \\"educational\\" gifts.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|Just got my mono set last Friday. Very cool. Being a hardcore fan for 27 years, I felt justified in spending the $$ on it for a couple reasons:     1 - It is the closest thing (barring listening on actual vinyl LP) to hearing what the Beatles in effect \\"wanted you to hear\\", since they sat in and/or participated in the mono mixing sessions, but not for the stereo ones (until later albums). A lot more effort and attention went into mixing the songs to mono for presentation than stereo, at the time stereo was kind of an afterthought because stereo systems hadn't taken over en masse yet.     2 - If you are used to growing up listening to the songs in stereo, then you are in for a treat since there are a lot of subtle and not so subtle differences in the mono versions. Different effects here and there, sometimes different full vocal takes (Help! for example), diffferent guitar bits (I'm Only Sleeping, I Call Your Name for example), and sometimes the song being in a different key because the tape was either slowed or sped up for the mono vs stereo version (She's Leaving Home for example).     For the serious fan, anything that represents a new or different way to hear these songs, or possibly hearing new parts of the songs that you couldn't before is a treat.     For the casual fan, the stereo set would likely sound more alive and better to you, as the mixes bring a lot more clarity across the stereo field and you'll get more of a feeling sometimes like you are there in the room with them when they were recording.     One more note on the stereo/mono thing, Help! and Rubber Soul have in addition to the mono mixes, they have the original stereo mixes from back in 1965, which largely means the songs have instruments on one side and vocals on the other. It is an interesting listen, but feels a little odd compared with what you are used to with stereo recordings that span the whole field rather than instruments hard left and vocals hard right or something.    Packaging is interesting too, each CD is wrapped in it's own little cover just like the LP covers. Also they went to the trouble to make paper inner sleeves just like the old original EMI vinyl record sleeves. The CD's are in the jacket in a plastic sleeve, but the paper \\"album looking\\" sleeve is there along with it, but the CD isn't in it. I guess they wanted to really recreate what it looked like to open Beatle vinyl albums back in \\"the day\\". Interesting.
B00005JLEU|4.0|This movie is fairly simple to recommend when you consider that it's well known.  I consider it to be essential to my collection.  It's kind of like the story of a child who grows into a more mature understanding of life through a series of magical events.  She has to ask for a job in a bathhouse for spirits and the manager has to give her one.  A lot of it is kind of funny as well as profound.

B002GZQY6Q|5.0|For a band that never settles into an easy formula, Porcupine Tree still manages to impress with The Incident, an all-encompassing musical adventure and concept album.    It surfaced early on that the follow-up to PT's very successful previous album, [[ASIN:B000O75F7C Fear of a Blank Planet]] would be another concept album and pretty much one long piece of music clocking in at 55 minutes. Steven Wilson, who has a writer's itch for long form, was rightfully satisfied with the quality of Anesthesize, the brilliant highlight of Blank Planet. In progressive rock, the form is not new, dating back at least to the grand daddy of them all, Genesis' Supper's Ready from 1972 and IQ,the Flower Kings or Transatlantic have certainly explored it thoroughly. But Porcupine Tree now gives it its own treatment, with spectacular results.    Before going further into The Incident, the \\"song\\", it should be noted that The Incident is actually two CDs, the main one and a second one made from four side tracks. It is an interesting choice: Fear of a Blank Planet had itself generated a companion album, [[ASIN:B0011BJQ52 Nil Recurring]], an EP belonging to the same creative cycle and bringing several variations and echos of the main project's themes. And so it is with The Incident's second CD, although we don't have to wait a year or so for its release. The material is clearly less impressive than the main cycle  but is pretty good nonetheless.    As for The Incident, it is primarily a high concept collection of songs exploring our reactions to tragedies and hardships, particularly in the context of modern media overload. This is why it is called the \\"incident\\", an all-purpose euphemism that is likely to cover unspeakable sorrow for the real actors but allows us, the public, to retain a certain distance, to avoid being reeled into the suffering and drowning in empathetic reaction. Wilson calls this the \\"Princess Diana effect\\", the fact that a tragedy affecting a person that cannot possibly have any interaction with most of us is able to trigger an overwhelming emotional response through the prism of media coverage. Meanwhile, Wilson has argued in interviews, we protect ourselves from having to react over and over to tragedies that affect us more directly. Thus The Incident, an exploration of human nature based on \\"incidents\\" from Wilson's own experience, probably making it Porcupine Tree's most autobiographical work to date... Light stuff.    It should be said that The Incident is not really one piece of music. It is made of 14 parts, most of which able to stand alone on their own. Furthermore, the transitions between the songs are sometimes almost seamless but not always so. Musically, PT is all over the map, which should not be a problem for afficionados used to Wilson's musical explorations. Historically, PT has often shown a great reverence for Pink Floyd's influence but has also dabbled in the musical territories of Dream Theater, Brian Eno, Robert Fripp or Nine Inch Nails among others. Most influences can be found here, including four instrumental sections. A few songs take some getting used to (still working on \\"Drawing The Line \\" for example...) but there is no filler and the whole cycle is fascinating.    The inescapable centerpiece of The Incident, a masterpiece in its own right and enough of a reason to buy the whole album, is the almost 12 mn long \\"Time Flies\\". Lyrically, it is the most autobiographical of all the songs in a pretty personal set:     \\"I was born in '67  The year of \\"Sgt. Pepper\\"  And \\"Are You Experienced\\"  Into a suburb or heaven  Yet it shoulda been forever  It all seemed to make so much sense  But after a while you realize time flies...\\"    Musically, the song is a glorious pastiche of Pink Floyd circa [[ASIN:B000024D4R Animals]], a fusion of Dogs and Sheep from this album with perhaps a touch of \\"Stars Die\\" from Porcupine Tree's own 1995's [[ASIN:B0002CU4Y8 Sky Moves Sideways]] sessions. The homage is not purely musical. The lyrics themselves channel Roger Waters' irony and gloom, even though Wilson's voice does not quite have the same bite, and allude directly to other Floyd songs as in:    You see there's something wrong here  I'm sorry if I'm not clear  Can you stop smoking your cigar?    The Incident is not for everyone. It takes work to absorb, its subject matter is clearly not \\"fun\\" and the treatment more experimental than on FOBP. But PT's fans will be awed and and any listener eager for intelligent, grown-up pop both musically and lyrically, will find little fault with it.

B002CLBJPK|4.0|In 1971, the Disney musical \\"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\\" was a film that captivated audiences with its special effects, music and storyline.  The film was nominated for five Academy Awards and won an award for \\"Best Effects, Special Visual Effects\\".<br /><br />Directed by Robert Stevens (\\"Mary Poppins\\", \\"The Love Bug\\" and \\"Herbie Rides Again\\"), Stevens teamed up with award winning composers, the Sherman Brothers  - Richard and Robert  (who took home two Academy Awards for \\"Mary Poppins\\"),  screenwriter Bill Walsh (\\"Mary Poppins\\", \\"Herbie Rides Again\\") and Don DaGradi (\\"Mary Poppins\\" and \\"The Love Bug\\").<br /><br />The film would feature major talents such as Angela Lansbury (\\"Murder, She Wrote\\", \\"The Manchurian Candidate\\", \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\", \\"Death on the Nile\\" and \\"Gaslight\\"), David Tomlinson (\\"The Love Bug\\", \\"Mary Poppins\\"), Roddy Mcdowall (\\"Fright Night\\", \\"Class of 1984', \\"Cleopatra\\"), Cindy O'Callaghan (\\"EastEnders\\", \\"Triangle\\", \\"The Bill\\"), Ian Weighill and Roy Snart.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"Bedknobs and Broomsticks: Enchanted Musical Edition\\" is now fully restored and remastered, the film is presented in Widescreen (1:66:1) and definitely improves upon the 2001 30th Anniversary release. The film looks much clearer and more vibrant but with that being said, for those who were wondering if dust and scratches are now gone from this 2009 version, unfortunately, the dust and scratches are quite evident.  Grain is evident but it's important to note that I am a reviewer that supports grain over DNR (digital noise reduction).<br /><br />I would imagine that the film print for \\"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\\" is in satisfactory shape.  I would hope that any major restoration would probably come during the time the film receives its High Definition Blu-ray transfer as Disney has done with a lot of their classic animated releases (note:  None of the classic live-action Disney films have been released on Blu-ray at this time) but it would be interesting to see if this is the best cleanup and remastering that can be done from the original print.<br /><br />As for audio, audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound (with also a French language track).  The film is primarily a dialogue and music-based film and utilizes the front and center channel of your home theater system.  I chose to listen to the film with my receiver setting on stereo on each channel.  But dialogue and music is quite clear and if there were any use of surround, I believe that most of it comes during the action sequences close to the end of the film.  But overall, the film is dialogue and music driven and both come out nice and clear through the front channels.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Bedknobs and Broomsticks: Enchanted Musical Edition\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  * THE WIZARDS OF SPECIAL EFFECTS - (8:07) Hosted By Jennifer Stone From Disney's \\"Wizards of Waverly Place\\", Jennifer Stone (who plays Harper on the TV show) becomes a \\"Special Effects Wizard Apprentice\\" and learns about the academy award winning 1971 special effects in Bedknobs and Broomsticks, then compares them to the special effects magic of her current show Disney's \\"Wizard's Of Waverly Place\\".<br />  * MUSIC MAGIC: The Sherman Brothers - (11:27) Take a look behind the scenes from a musical point of view of Bedknobs and Broomsticks with The Sherman Brothers, Angela Lansbury and Scott MacQueen. This featurettes explores the origins of the songs, including what was deleted and what made it into the final version of the film.<br />  * DELETED SONG - \\"A Step in the Right Direction\\" - (3:48) The original featurette with the deleted song that appeared on the 1996 LD release.<br />  * \\"PORTOBELLO ROAD\\" Recording Session - (1:10) A rare clip of David Tomlinson's recording of the song \\"Portobello Road\\".<br />  * Theatrical Trailers - Four \\"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\\" theatrical trailers<br />  * Dylan & Cole Sprouse - Blu-ray is Suite! - (4:45) A promotional for Disney Blu-ray<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\\" is a classic Disney film that I grew up with.  Although, when it comes to Disney classic musicals, \\"Mary Poppins\\" is much more memorable in terms of music, \\"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\\" captured my attention because of the special effects, the storyline and how it was able to incorporate so much.

Although, when it comes to Disney classic musicals, \\"Mary Poppins\\" is much more memorable in terms of music, \\"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\\" captured my attention because of the special effects, the storyline and how it was able to incorporate so much.

0739367676|5.0|Loved the audiobook, it was unabridged so nothing from the book was missing and it was great to have in the car, i just put the cd in the cd player and it made my car ride to the cape pass by so quickly, it was great when I was stuck in traffic. I got so involved with the book, I love how stephanie meyer writes.
B0024FAG5I|3.0|In 1995, then-blossoming director Sam Raimi (who went on to direct the \\"Spider-Man\\" and \\"The Evil Dead\\" films) and writer Simon Moore (\\"Traffic\\") worked on their first Western.  Joined by composer Alan Silvestri (\\"G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra\\", \\"Beowulf\\", \\"Night at the Museum\\" and \\"The Mummy\\" films) and cinematographer Dante Spinotti (\\"X-Men: The Last Stand\\", \\"The Family Man\\" and \\"Red Dragon\\"), the crew set out to create a unique western that has never been done before.<br /><br />\\"The Quick and the Dead\\" featured an all-star cast which included the sexy Sharon Stone (\\"Basic Instinct\\", \\"Sliver\\", \\"Bobby\\" and \\"Catwoman\\"), the legendary actor Gene Hackman (\\"Unforgiven\\", \\"Crimson Tide\\", \\"The Replacements\\", \\"Heist\\", \\"Behind Enemy Lines\\" and \\"Runaway Jury\\") and two actors that would become popular a few years after the release of this film, Russel Crowe (\\"Gladiator\\", \\"A Beautiful Mind\\", \\"Cinderella Man\\", \\"American Gangster\\") and Leonardo DiCaprio (\\"Titanic\\", \\"The Departed\\", \\"Bood Diamond\\", \\"Gangs of New York\\").<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"The Quick and the Dead\\" receives its first HD release on Blu-ray.  Featured in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1), the film for the most part captures that Western feel and at times, the picture quality showcases the grit of the West.  From Sharon Stone's blue eyes to gold in the the teeth of some of the people in the town, there are times that the picture quality looks very good especially since this is a 15-year-old film.<br /><br />But there are times when the picture quality just looks bad.  In one scene during a discussion between Ellen and Cort and when it focuses on her, the film looks as if the the low light added so much noise around the film.  Fortunately, this segment is short.  The other thing is that the film in high definition also does make certain CG segments a bit unreal (ie. a tremendous hole in the middle of one's head).<br /><br />But for the most part, the film does look good for a film back in 1995.  And happy to know that Sony has decided not to use DNR (digital noise reduction) and kept the grain intact.<br /><br />As for the audio, \\"The Quick and the Dead\\" sounds awesome.  The lossless audio really takes advantage of the surround channels.  I was pretty impressed because it's one thing to get the clear dialogue and the gun shots from the front and center channels (and gun shots zipping  through the surround channels)  but there a good amount of scenes that really utilize the surround channels and some of those booms are not just short, some actually linger.  I also noticed a bit of LFE, so for the most part, the audio for \\"The Quick and the Dead\\" was pretty solid. Not reference quality but for a 1995 film, it sounds great.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English, English SDH and French.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"The Quick and the Dead\\" comes with only one special feature (aside from the trailers) and that is the film is presented in movieIQ.  For those with Blu-ray players that are BD-Live enabled, you can watch the film while a panel on the side can be accessed via your remote with information about the cast, crew, music and production.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"The Quick and the Dead\\" is by no means the greatest Western, nor is it the best.  But what it does well is trying to accomplish something different by capturing the look and feel of a spaghetti Western, but also making the protagonist a female surrounded by an interesting group of characters.<br /><br />Sharon Stone is absolutely beautiful in this film and the film wasn't created that long after \\"Basic Instinct\\".  She was one of America's top, sexiest female leads and it was interesting to see her in a film that captures that beauty and sexiness but also has a hint of danger around her.  I suppose its up to the viewer if she was a win or fail for the film but for the most part, the concept of a female protagonist was definitely enjoyable to see in this film.  It's also important to notethat this was the first film that Sharon Stone co-produced.<br /><br />As for the other talent, Gene Hackman is just solid in any Western.  The film was made a few years after his Academy Award winning appearance in the classic Western \\"Unforgiven\\" and he seemed as a natural playing the antagonist in \\"The Quick and the Dead\\".  As for Russell Crowe, he was still an unknown in the US despite being popular in Australia and Asia (especially in Japan for his other 1995 film \\"No Way Back\\") and Leonardo DiCaprio was starting to emerge after his Academy Award nominated performance in the 1993 film \\"What's Eating Gilbert Grape?\\" and plays a young man quick with his gun but all he has wanted was respect from his outlaw father John Herod.<br /><br />The film also had interesting behind-the-scenes information (probably why there are no special features included on the Blu-ray) in regard to Sharon Stone starring in the film only if Sam Raimi directed and writer Simon Moore being fired and then rehired to fix a script written by writer Tom Sayles but instead of fixing it, omitted Sayles work completely and gave him his own rewrite.  It's important to note that Sony at the time was against Russell Crowe and Leonardo DiCaprio to be in the film that Sharon Stone was the one who fought for Crowe to be in the film and because of Sony not wanting DiCaprio for the film, Stone paid him out of her own pocket.<br /><br />If anything, I felt that Raimi did a fine job with this film because no matter what was going to happen, there would be viewers that don't necessarily have female gunslingers in their minds as the main protagonist.  Sure, the gunfights may be cliche and the screenplay may not be deep and engaging, but \\"The Quick and the Dead\\" was not a film I was expecting to be the next \\"Unforgiven\\" nor was I expecting anything remotely close to a Clint Eastwood or John Wayne film either.<br /><br />Overall, \\"The Quick and the Dead\\" was a wild, fun and entertaining film that may not have been a financial success in the box office nor was it a film that received many positive responses from the critics, but it was one of those films that people didn't take seriously and wanted a Western popcorn flick to enjoy and be entertained.  For those who want to see a different kind of Western on Blu-ray, you may want to give this film a chance.ckman is just solid in any Western.

B0011UF79C|3.0|The story is a newer idea of 'big brother' which, when you come to think of it, may not be that far away. The current DNA insights make this very plausable and quite scary, really.    Acting is quite different from the usual (possibly to create a more alienating environment?) but really good.     I really enjoyed this movie.
B0024FAG62|4.0|Entertaining, well-written and overall a well-directed film with an all-star cast... \\"Silverado\\" is fantastic Western film.<br /><br />From the late 1970's to mid-1980's, there was a glut of Western films.  But in 1985, the Western known as \\"Silverado\\" took America by storm and was nominated for four Academy Awards.  Directed and written by Lawrence Kasdan (\\"Wyatt Earp\\", \\"The Big Chill\\", \\"Raiders of the Lost Arc\\", \\"Star Wars: Epiosde V - The Empire Strikes Back\\") and co-written by Mark Casdan, the Casdan's were joined by composer Bruce Broughton (\\"Tiny Toon Adventures\\", \\"Infinity\\" and \\"Lost in Space\\") and cinematographer John Bailey (\\"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days\\", \\"Mad Money, \\"The Producers\\" and \\"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants\\").<br /><br />\\"Silverado\\" would feature an all-star cast which included Kevin Kline (\\"Wild Wild West\\", \\"The Pink Panther\\", \\"The Big Chill\\" and \\"A Fish Called Wanda\\"), Scott Glenn (\\"Training Day\\", \\"Vertical Limit\\", \\"Freedom Writers\\" and \\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\"), Kevin Costner (\\"Field of Dreams\\", \\"Untouchables\\", \\"JFK\\", \\"The Bodyguard\\" and Wyatt Earp\\"), Danny Glober (\\"Lethal Weapon\\" films, \\"Borthers & Sisters\\", \\"ER\\", \\"Dreamgirls\\"), Brian Dennehy (\\"Our Fathers, \\"Ratatouille\\", \\"Romeo & Juliet\\"), Rosanna Arquette (\\"What About Brian\\", \\"The L World\\", \\"Pulp Fiction\\"), John Cleece (\\"Monty Python\\" films, \\"Fawlty Towers\\", \\"A Fish Called Wanda\\") and Linda Hunt (\\"The Unit\\", \\"The American Experience\\", \\"The Practice\\" and \\"Carnivale\\").<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, as \\"Silverado\\" is a Columbia Pictures classic, as a few classics from Sony, gets the special Digibook release (not in typical blue clamshell but a book-style format) which features a 38-page booklet that includes information on the filming of \\"Silverado\\", information on the film's talent, plus images from the film and theatrical posters.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"Silverado\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  For the most part, the film is definitely a mix-bag.  For a film that was shown in theaters back in 1985, the scenery of where the film is very beautiful.  But in the opening shots alone, I wouldn't be surprised if there are viewers who may find the opening scenes as too grainy and a bit aged.  Blacks are nice and deep and skin tones are natural.  The fact, that a lot of the film is shot outdoors and giving that sense of a vibrant Western era and its natural element is captured quite beautifully.  From the mountains to the blue skies and the animals, I enjoyed how the filmmakers really captured that look and feel of the late 1800's.  Suffice to say that cinematographer John Bailey did a wonderful job.<br /><br />While most of the film looks very good and detail of the West can be seen quite well via High Definition, as a person who likes to see grain in their Blu-ray releases and no DNR (digital noise reduction), I acknowledge that this is one of those films on Blu-ray that will definitely have film fans of both sides of the picture quality fence supporting or not supporting the grainy appearance of the film.  And personally, I do feel this is the best looking version of \\"Silverado\\" to date (and obviously surpassing the quality of the 2005 Superbit DVD release) and is the best release of Silverado to date.<br /><br />Audio is presented in English, French and Portuguese Dolby TrueHD 5.1 (and Spanish 5.1).  The lossless audio quality features a lot of the primary dialogue coming through the front and center channels but there is a good use of panning through the surround channels as bullets whizzing from left to right.  For the most part, the gunshots do come alive during the film and dialogue is quite clear and understandable.<br /><br />Subtitles are presented in English, English SDH, French, Spanish and Portuguese.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Silverado\\" comes with the following special features that are in Standard Definition, English audio and feature subtitles in Spanish and Portuguese:<br /><br />* Along the Silverado Trail: A Western Historians' Commentary - The commentary are done by two Western historians.  For the most part, both men are quite knowledgeable when it comes to Westerns and lend their own personal opinions of this film and relation to other Westerns.  I always find it interesting when people plug their own events during a commentary, when who knows when people will listen to the commentary.  But nevertheless, interesting commentary and I do agree with some of the points that they had for the film.  The following commentary is new for this Blu-ray release.<br />  * The Making of Silverado - (37:01) The cast and crew of \\"Silverado\\" discuss how certain scenes were made for the film and also how they had to decrease the duration and certain scenes were cut and some regrets of not furthering storylines (ie. Rosanna Arquette's character).<br />  * A Return to Silverado with Kevin Costner - (21:01) Kevin Costner talks about the film, how he got the part, the people he worked with and mostly a complimentary featurette for the director.  Also, certain scenes during shooting that he never understood at the time but understands now.<br />  * movieiQ - For those with a BD-Live enabled Blu-ray player (profile 2.0), when selecting this option, a panel shows up during the watching of the film and people can access cast, crew, music and production information.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"Silverado\\" is a modern, stylized-Western with an impressive cast with ambitious filmmaking (the film took 96 days to film) and at the time, it had been quite long while for a Western to show up on the big screen.  So, for the most part, \\"Silverado\\" was a Western that many people watched and enjoyed and for the most part, it was good timing.<br /><br />The storytelling of Lawrence and Mark Kasdan is top-notch and suffice to say, there was a lot of hype around Kasdan's name as he was the guy who wrote the \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\", \\"Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi\\" and \\"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back\\" film.  Suffice to say, Lawrence Kasdan was a very much respect screenwriter and as a director, many people appreciated  his work on \\"The Big Chill\\" and \\"Body Heat\\".<br /><br />But what makes \\"Silverado\\" so enjoyable are its characters.  Emmet and Jake, the two brothers are so different from each other but yet Emmet brings us that stoic cowboy, while Jake is almost a comedic but cool kind of guy.  With Paden, almost like an everyman type of role.  Cool, calm and reserved and for the role of Mal, it was quite interesting to see an African-American in the film but also to see a little bit of how racism affected the character.  But to bring these four characters together, definitely made up for a fun and entertaining film.<br /><br />Although I did enjoy the film, I do feel that the film had some problems.  The relationship with Rosanna Arquette's Hannah and Scott Glenn's Emmett really goes nowhere.  In fact, you will learn in the special features that after the film came out, some have wished that they could have explored more of Arquette's character because it was underused.  Also, Jeff Goldblum's character as \\"Slick\\", we don't really know the motivation of his character unless he was much closer to Cobb than we know of.  After watching the film, it makes you wonder how much of his footage was cut from the film.<br /><br />As for those who own the Superbit DVD version, sure this Blu-ray release may not come with the playing cards but it does come with a commentary and a booklet with far more pages and most importantly a High Definition transfer and lossless audio.  This release easily becomes the definitive version to own.  Granted, the film was nearly three hours at first but was cut down to 132 minutes.  With that being said, it would have been nice to see those deleted scenes (which were briefly shown in the \\"making of\\" featurette\\") included on this Blu-ray release.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Silverado\\" isone of those films that continually has action and makes you wonder which direction the film is going to go and who is going to die.  You rarely get bored and for the most part, the film was quite entertaining.  For me, I kind of liken it to a film as enjoyable like John Wayne's \\"El Dorado\\" - a film with a great cast of characters, enjoyable storyline and a lot of action.<br /><br />Granted, although \\"Silverado\\" may not be as deep as a modern Western such as \\"Unforgiven\\", it's definitely a film that was enjoyable from beginning to end and have wished for decades that there would have been a sequel created.<br /><br />Nevertheless, if you are a big fan of this film, \\"Silverado\\" may not be hailed as a Western classic but for a modern Western, it's one of my favorite Westerns created within the last 25 years.  Definitely recommended!uch respect screenwriter and as a director, many people appreciated  his work on \\"The Big Chill\\" and \\"Body Heat\\".

B002OHK7CS|1.0|This program is a true egg sucker.  Nothing but violence personified.  The biker image was way overdone.  In this one episode there was one lady shot in the head with a mac10.  Her husband was directed to an innocent man and the husband killed the innocent guy.  Katey Sagal, who is a complete fox, talks trash throughout.  She is later raped by several men after being beaten and hung up on a fence.  The major amount of members are over the hill in age and the way they speak.  It was truly a depressive thing to watch.  I do not recommend this program to anyone.
B002DYKP8S|3.0|Beautiful, artistic, poetic...an enchanting martial arts film that will captivate you with every scene!<br /><br />These are the words I feel about \\"HERO\\", the 2002 film directed by Zhang Yimou (\\"Curse of the Golden Flower\\", \\"The House of Flying Daggers\\" and \\"Happy Times\\") and a film that would feature cinematography by Christopher Doyle (\\"Chungking Express\\", \\"In the Mood For Love\\", \\"Fallen Angels\\", \\"Happy Together\\") and music by composer Tan Dan (\\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\", \\"The Legend of the Black Scorpion\\").<br /><br />The film would also star Asia's top talents which include Jet Li (\\"The Warlords\\", \\"Fearless\\", \\"Once Upon a Time in China\\", \\"Fist of Legend\\"), Tony Leung Chiu Wai (\\"Lust, Caution\\", \\"Red Cliff\\", \\"Tokyo Raiders\\", \\"Infernal Affairs\\"), Maggie Cheung (\\"Ashes of Time\\", \\"Sausalito\\", \\"In the Mood for Love\\", \\"Comrades: Almost a Love Story\\"),  Daoming Chen (\\"Peace Blossom\\", \\"My 1919', \\"Infernal Affairs III\\"), Zhang Ziyi (\\"House of Flying Dagger\\", \\"My Wife is a Gangster\\", \\"Musa the Warrior\\", \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\") and Donnie Yen (\\"All's Well, End's Well\\", \\"Iron Monkey\\", \\"Flash Point\\" and \\"Bodyguards and Assassins\\").<br /><br />The film which was Hong Kong's most expensive film at the time, was critically acclaimed, won several awards and eventually would make over $178 million worldwide in the box office.<br /><br />\\"HERO\\" is presented on a two-ray Blu-ray disc with one being the primary Blu-ray and the other being a digital copy version of the film.  Also, the Blu-ray also comes in a slipcase.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"HERO\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1) and suffice to say, this film just looks incredible.  It's one of the most significant qualities of this film is its artistic direction, costume design, set design, location and most of all, the cinematography of Christopher Doyle.<br /><br />Personally, I have always have seen Christopher Doyle as an avant-garde cinematographer since he worked on Wong Kar Wai's \\"Chungking Express\\" and suffice to say, his amazing cinematography and the tight editing really pulled the artistic vision of director Zhang Yimou to new heights.<br /><br />Picture quality is vibrant.  Very vibrant and color plays a big part in this film.  Grain is seen on the film and I'm glad to see that Walt Disney has again kept with that and not gone the excessive DNR (Digital Noise Reduction) route.  But for a film that came out back in 2002, is it a reference film on Blu-ray?  Not really.  But it does look very good.  Part of the main reason is that despite the film being shot in beautiful locations and costume design and the colors really enhance the look of the film, it's no super clear, nor is it reference quality compared to recently released films on Blu-ray but still, \\"HERO\\" is just absolutely magnificent to watch.<br /><br />As for audio quality, this is where it pains me to give it slightly less than perfect score.  The film is presented with an English 5.1 DTS-HD losless audio track but the original Chinese language is only in Dolby Digital 5.1 (along with the Spanish and French).  For a film of this caliber, I was hoping there would be a lossless audio track for the Chinese language but unfortunately, it's not.<br /><br />But for some, I know it's a dealbreaker for some that the original language is not in lossless audio but the English version is and to be fair, I will say that the English dubwork is very good for this film.  For earlier DVD releases, Asian films released in the US had terrible English dubbing but I will say that \\"HERO\\" turned out very well.<br /><br />For audio, sounds such as the rains, swords clanging, arrows zipping through air... this is all captured quite well on the DTS-HD lossless audio track and sounds great.  For the most part, audio is front and central channel driven with dialogue, music and sound effects but many of the soundtracks do utilize the surround channels.  Again, I wish the original language was in lossless but for those who enjoyed the dubwork, you will be pleased by the DTS-HD audio.<br /><br />As for subtitles, subtitles are presented in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"HERO\\" comes with the following special features (in 480i, English 2.0 Dolby Digital, English SDH, French and Spanish subtitles):<br /><br />  * Close-Up of a Fight Scene - (9:18) The secrets of the fighting choreography of \\"HERO\\".  Quentin Tarentino, Jet Li and Donni Yuen discuss the fighting choreography.  Also, storyboard and fighting scene comparisons.  (Note: Some of the footage is the same as the one used on the main featurette).<br />  * Hero Defined - (24:01) The Director and talent on their experiences of working on the film and the challenges they faced.  Also, how locations were selected and what took place before the shooting of the film, during and after.<br />  * Storyboards - (5:19) A side-by-side (or more like top-and-bottom) comparison of the storyboards and final feature.<br />  * Inside the Action.  A Conversation with Quentin Tarentino and Jet Li - (13:55) Jet Li is interviewed by Quentin Tarentino about his past films and working on \\"Hero\\".<br />  * Soundtrack Spot - (:39) commercial spot for the \\"Hero\\" soundtrack.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"HERO\\" is a film that really distinguishes itself from other martial arts film due to its artistic style, wonderful cinematography, well-chosen locations and of course, having a talented director and top talents of HK cinema definitely helps as well.<br /><br />For the most part, \\"HERO\\" was definitely one of those films that you can remember for many years later for its scenes.  From the vibrancy of the colors used, the battle scene on top of the lake (which Director Zhang Yimou wanted perfect still waters and didn't mind waiting to film when it happened), the thousands of arrowheads attacking the art school, there is simply many scenes that are just memorable.<br /><br />Sure, \\"HERO\\" is a beautiful film known for its cinematography, its talent, its location but what about the storyline?  The story of \\"HERO\\" is good but not great.  Where a film like \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" is one of those films that captured beauty through its storyline, \\"HERO\\" definitely relies on the visuals to enhance the storyline.  Because the film is split up into three arcs with three different stories of what took place, it's all about how the viewer interprets that storyline and how that storyline touches their soul.<br /><br />Personally, I have found \\"HERO\\" almost like a piece of art.  You embrace everything that went on to create that artistic piece.  From its characters as Jet Li and Donnie Yen are just fantastic when they battle each other during their scene.  You know that when these two are together onscreen, you're going to get a beautiful, captivating scene with the best fighting choreography.  When you see Tony Leung Chiu Wai and Maggie Chung, you know that these two have awesome chemistry and that they can bring out the more dramatic scenes and even during their fighting scenes, everything seems believable and the two enforce the vibrancy and color of the film.  The same goes with Zhang Ziyi who brings the more emotional scenes to the film.<br /><br />But is the Blu-ray release perfect?  Unfortunately, it misses the mark of perfection due to the Blu-ray not including a lossless audio track for the Chinese language.  I was so excited about \\"HERO\\" on Blu-ray and it's a given, we are going to get awesome picture quality because it's a colorful and vibrant film.  You know that the scene between Falling Snow vs. Moon with its rich red colors and yellow leaves is going to be absolutely brilliant on HD or the scene when Broken Sword and Falling Snow wear these blue outfits or their green outfits and you know that color is going to look great on Blu-ray.  But along with that awesome picture quality, you want awesome audio.<br /><br />The English dub is definitely oneof the better English dubs for an Asian film and the lossless audio track was very good.  But I was torn by wanting to watch the film in its original language but knowing that the audio quality of the Chinese Dolby Digital 5.1 was nowhere near the 5.1 DTS-HD English track.  For a fan of this film, for me...it was bittersweet.<br /><br />So, overall \\"HERO\\" is definitely a wonderful film to catch on Blu-ray and it's great to see Disney give this release a digital copy as well.  But for the most part, \\"HERO\\" could have been a great release but without the Chinese audio track in HD, it ends up being just an average release.e \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" is one of those films that captured beauty through its storyline, \\"HERO\\" definitely relies on the visuals to enhance the storyline.  Because the film is split up into three arcs with three different stories of what took place, it's all about how the viewer interprets that storyline and how that storyline touches their soul.    Personally, I have found \\"HERO\\" almost like a piece of art.  You embrace everything that went on to create that artistic piece.

0767020308|5.0|I throulgy enjoy this adaptation.  I watch it often, and each time get something more out of it.  This Emma really has the right tone, the cast and acting are spot on, and I don't think Jane Austen would have any serious problems with this version.
B0025KVLU6|5.0|The White Album is 5+ stars, with a artistic and cultural impact that is hard to fathom.  There really is no need to expand further.    Two opinions I'd like to share about these remasters:    1.  I think it is difficult to really determine how these albums are different with the remastering.  Initially, we can all hear the clearer and sharper sound; there seems to be little debate of that.  I think the test will come over time, just as it has with the Beatles' albums until this point.  We've all been listening to the CD's for 22 years, and the vinyl before that, and the sounds are etched into our brains.  Now we'll listen to the remasters, and after a few years if the 87 version is spun, we'll note how different (and probably inferior) it sounds.  My point is that there is no way to accurately judge how this product is different after a listen or two.    2.  Like most Beatlemaniacs, I've had a tough time deciding between stereo and mono sets.  The conclusion I've come to is that the reasons for getting the mono version are the wrong reasons!  Preferences for mono are typically stated in terms of how disappointing the stereo mixes are, rather than how incredible the mono mixes are.  That just seems the wrong reason to buy something (anything, for that matter).  Would anybody choose mono over properly mixed stereo?  And then the stereo box has some drawbacks (I'd much rather purchase the remixed Yellow Submarine, there is still the goofy right/left separation, etc.)  So, to resolve the dilemma, I'm going to buy the individual CD's as I choose (White Album and Abbey Road to start), and then hope that a true remix on a superior format (SACD, DVD, etc.) will come out at some point, which I feel pretty certain will eventually happen.
0307266303|5.0|I didn't just stumble over this book, but instead, like I've done with so many other books, I sought it out after I'd heard about it on NPR. A few weeks back, I was in the car for a while and I listened to a great interview with the author on my local NPR station, WHYY. Listening to the interview was very inspiring because of the author' passion. I wanted to stop the car and get out and run because I know what he was speaking about.<br />Years ago, for some unknown reason I began running, not because I was looking to get into shape or lose weight but rather because I found it meditative. Running affected more than my physical self, it grounded me mentally and brought an inner peace. Over time though I've let life interfere and I'd only run intermittingly. I was trying to recapture something without quite know what it was. Of course before I realized it my physical health has declined and my mental acuity has not been as strong as I know it can be. Also, like the author, I was ever mindful of injury though I must say that I've been very lucky because I've never really had anything more serious than a sprain or the soreness that comes from trying to run too far, too fast, too soon.<br />While reading the book I kept finding myself speaking out loud, nearly shouting at times, because I finally understood what I'd always felt when I ran. For me, running, just running for the fun of it, with no agenda, no distance expectations, gives me more benefits than I can count. I love the way I feel when I've been able to make sure that I dedicate the time necessary to get out on the trail consistently.<br />Thank you Mr. McDougall, I owe you one...

B00004W5A6|5.0|Just arrived in the post. And the good news is that the sound quality is in a different league to the regular CD (as you would expect from SACD). Great album, studio quality sound. Stereo-only mix, but for this material that's what it should be.

0446579939|5.0|I was replacing a lost library book and needed a book with a specific ISBN number.  I contacted the seller, told him my situation and he confirmed that the book he would be mailing me was a match.  His accuracy enabled me to replace the book for less than half of what the library was going to charge me.  His prompt and accurate response was extremely helpful and served to increase my level of trust in Amazon products.

B002JYPV3G|5.0|My favorite part of this 10th anniversary is the dvd. I enjoy of the (sic): Your Nightmare Are Dreams the most, as of today this is my fifth time watching this since I've had it for a week now. I have also listened to the cd several times since too, the extra songs is something I have wanted for a long time, I am glad they are featured in this edition. If you love Slipknot you have to get this. I hope Slipknot makes another album like this in the future, you never know, but i doubt that Slipknot will make an album like this or Iowa again.

B002C6K7N0|5.0|Megadeth has been a reference for every band and fans since the beginning of the 1990s and until now those still stand up and listen closely to every Megadeth's new album and get stunned by the greatness of this band lead by their unbreakable leader Dave Mustaine.<br />Starting from the Instrumental introduction to the album going to the sad Acoustic song in the Middle to the end of the album, this album reaches perfection in every sense.<br />I think this album should remind people that rock is still alive and talent lives on.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|Megadeth, Dave Mustaine, both are names that are commonplace in the Metal Community and for good reason as Dave has been releasing quality Metal since the Mid-Eighties and that is no easy feat considering most of the bands that Megadeth grew with conformed to more mainstream styles or broke up. Mustaine and Megadeth continue to be constant idols for new and old fans of Rock and Metal to look up to. Mustaine's most recent offering Endgame is possibly one of my favorite releases by the group in years.<br /><br />Endgame kicks off with 2:25 of Mustaine and Co. ripping up some amazing riffs as the first track 'Dialectic Chaos' is Instrumental and a great start to an amazing album. Mustaine's trademark quality soloing hasn't lost any of it potency and you can tell right from this short track that this album will be one to enjoy for quite some time. The instrumental leads into 'This Day We Fight!', a very upbeat track with to-the-point lyrics and some impressive soloing.<br /><br />'44 Minutes' starts out with some tranquil leads and the eerie recordings of 911 tapes. This would be one of the tracks where Dave gives us something to think about as the lyrics discuss the general violence in the world today and more particularly tells the story of being amidst a fire fight. '1,320' is a romp of riffing, bombastic drumming and roaring leads that towards the end erupts into one of the best solo's on the album.<br /><br />Four tracks into the album and I find myself still extremely intrigued as to what will come next. Something that I honestly haven't felt for a Megadeth album in some time. I would not consider the album groundbreaking by this point, however I would say it ranks up there with some of Mustaine's best works such as [[ASIN:B0002EXH54 Peace Sells...But Who's Buying?]], [[ASIN:B0002EXH5O Rust in Peace]] and my personal favorite [[ASIN:B0002EXH40 Youthanasia]]. So far Dave has tackled the most prominent problem in our world today violence and has done it with style rather then preaching.<br /><br />Later in the album we get what I can only describe as a modern classic and the title track 'Endgame'. Easily a massive stand out track on the album with a barrage of pummeling aggressive riffs, epic solo's and one of the catchiest chorus' on the album. This track alone is sure to be aired all over Metal radio for some time to come and is a personal favorite. As a contrast Dave then slows things down with the tranquil 'The Hardest Part of Letting Go... Sealed With A Kiss' that halfway through twists into a mid pace ballad and ends with the same melodic opening.<br /><br />My favorite track on the album 'Head Crusher' erupts with a barrage of soloing and Thrashy riffs. I think I enjoyed the simplicity of the lyrics that took a back seat to the roaring fast paced Thrash riffs. Towards the end of the track comes a classic head bang riff with some nice gritty leads and the track closes just as fast paced as it opened with one of the fastest solos on the album. 'How The Story Ends' is straight forward Megadeth and yet like the previous track has some head bang worthy riffing toward the end and as with most of the album has some excellent soloing.<br /><br />The album finishes with 'The Right to Go Insane' which starts out as a rather bland and ordinary Megadeth track ends with nearly two minutes of soloing and intense riffing. After all is said and done I wasn't in complete awe, nor can I honestly call this Megadeth's masterpiece however I can say this is a quality album from a musician who still sticks to the roots of the genre and most if not all Megadeth Fans will enjoy this most especialy if you are a fan of the solos as nearly every song has at least one.<br /><br />A great album and sure to be on all the Best Of 2009 lists is a must for Metal fans and especially Deth Heads like myself. I hope you enjoyed the review and that it encourages you to look into Endgame and ultimately purchase the album. If so please click 'Yes' below and support a supporter of the Metal Community. Thanks for reading.<br /><br />-A Loyal Megadeth Faneading.     -A Loyal Megadeth Fan

B00006CXSS|5.0|This series of World War II was so powerful, so accurate, but also so intense that I was blown away.  I truly did not want to get to the 10th epiosode because I did not want the series to end.  Damian Lewis was excellent as were all the actors and I thank Tom Hanks and Steven Spielburg for having the foresight to make such a dramtic portrayal of a heroic time in our history.  My thanks to all the soldiers who so bravely fought & died for our freedom.  It was positively excellent and I recommend everyone see it.
1423101499|4.0|Things are coming to a head in the Percy Jackson world. The camp half blood children have found an entrance to Pan's Labyrinth inside the camps grounds. They also discover that Luke and his minions have been using the Labyrith to transport troops. Not a good combination. To make matters worse Percy has caused trouble in yet another school, Annabeth is acting strangely around him, and Grover has seven days to find Pan have his searcher's license stripped away.<br /><br />The majority of the book is set in the labyrith, which is great. We meet all kinds of interesting characters, and our heroes are tested in numerous ways. This book does not directly follow the path of the other novels, which are largely based on traveling across the country running into one or two nice shop owners who turn out bad. I feel that The Battle of the Labyrinth had a bit more substance than the rest of the series, and I can't wait to read the final installment. I find little to criticize in this one. Very entertaining.
B002GZQYMA|5.0|want what I'm having? then order the Resistance! This album has more of everything I love about Muse, classical and opera influences throughout, even in a hard rocking track like Unnatural Selection, where I also hear echoes of Led Zeppelin. Matt Bellamy's amazing voice goes from low and sexy in Uprising to a beautiful falsetto in Exogenesis with many passionate notes in between those. There is the variety of musical styles, beautiful piano, inventive percussion, down & dirty  bass lines and killer guitar shredding I've come to love from the previous 4 albums, but improved and matured. The lyrics are inspiring, both emotionally and politically. Finally, Exogenesis may be the most beautiful piece of music I have ever heard (and I am a middle aged person with wide ranging musical tastes); it has brought tears to my eyes each of the 6 times I've listened to it so far.

B002M5ZCEU|5.0|This is not Whitney from \\"How Will I Know?\\" The new and in my opinion, improved Whitney has a husky, sultriness that only comes from living. She has lived a hell of a life and you can hear it in every song on this album. \\"I Turn To You\\", the first single is a fine example of what the new Whitney is capable of. There are no sour notes and there are no super high notes that we are used to from her. Instead, there is a well-aged sadness to her voice that I really like. This is a triumph for her as there isn't a bad track on this album. There is a reason it debuted at #1 on the Billboards. It is deserving of this spot. Whitney and her brand of torch songs and empowering dance tracks have been sorely missed. Glad to have her back.
B002BIULQC|5.0|Is a good movie,very emotional,romantic and fun .And a lot song to see and hear too!! This Combo Pack is COOL!!! Buy this Combo guys .
B0014Z4OQG|2.0|This is 9/11 meets Godzilla meets Blair Witch Project meets Alien. The scenes of falling buildings and billowing smoke blowing up Manhattan streets like an avalanche are straight out of 9/11. The filmmakers are up front about their homage to the Japanese Godzilla movies. And the hand-held video cam throughout the entire 75 minute film is Blair Witch, but very annoying after awhile. I thought the little spidery monsters looked like Alien leftovers. There are almost as many extras as there is movie, but you won't care if you don't like the film. I thought it was ok, if a bit thin. The 20 something actors don't show much talent.
B001GCUO4I|3.0|At heart, all horror movies operate on the human response to mortality.  Your average horror fan gets a thrill from the films because they are a sort of spice for life, they are the seasoning that makes the mundane parts of life all the more richer.  Watch a bunch of people get sliced and diced by a monster or madman, and that adrenaline rush makes you feel as if, on some level, you yourself have cheated death.  For awhile or more, it's nice to be alive.<br /><br />The FINAL DESTINATION films utilize the same premise, but instead of creating a defeatable or relatable villain, it makes the very act of dying the villain.  Watching the movies, it's very much like they decided that the force of Death, after a millenia of ending lives, has grown bored and has decided to put some spice into his job.  In all of the movies, Death awards a young soul with a premonition of a huge catastrophe, and when that soul saves him/herself (along with a handful of others), Death gleefully sets up cat-and-mouse games with the survivors and watches as they scream and skitter.  The question is never Will They Die?  It is How Long Can They Hold Out?<br /><br />Because everyone dies, sooner or later, and it's rarely at the hands of a zombie or a Leatherface.  Car accidents are far more common.  Fires.  Mechanical failures.  The FD films make Death a snarky, sadistic force without ever showing his face.  Instead, Death operates basically through three cards -- wind, gravity, and passive human interference -- and with these three things, he orchestrates the deaths of dozens and dozens of characters.  These films are filled with pointless scenes of people screaming that they're in control of their lives, scoffing at the idea that Death lurks everywhere.  Then they die.<br /><br />The real fun in these films lies in the complex machinations that Death sets in motion with the leak of a pipe or the flutter of a bird.  If you're expecting interesting plots, complex characters, or realistic dialogue, prepare to be HEAVILY disappointed.  In fact, these elements of the films get steadily more and more wooden and cartoonish, until by the fourth installment, they are laughably bad.  The makers know that what you're really waiting for is to watch Death do his thing, investing everything from quarters to fishsticks with a sinister menace.  To that end, I have provided here a summary of the only thing about each of these films that is worth watching: the death scenes.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0780631684 Final Destination (New Line Platinum Series)]]:<br />In the first film, Death's premonition is visited upon a young student on a plane.  The ensuing plane accident (5/5) gave me nightmares for a week.  When the student leaves the plane along with others, he then experiences more premonitions (most of them cheesy reflections in windows) indicating that Death is now hunting them down.  Of all the movies, this one features the most personified version of Death.  A dark mist accompanies each death, and you can even see Death pursuing some characters, especially in a tense bathroom scene (4/5).  Some of the deaths feature complex sequences of domino-like chains (there is a catastrophic house fire (4/5) and a menacing electrical storm (4/5)).  Others are less creative (the bus and train accidents are both unimaginative throwaways (2/5)).  The final death (by sign) is a cheeky nod at the movie's premise (4/5).  Notable in this film: Death has a soundtrack, which turns out to feature, over and over again, \\"Leaving on a Jet Plane.\\"<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00005JLZK Final Destination 2]]:<br />Death isn't so hung up on music this time around, but that's okay because he's a bit more creative.  This film's opening highway accident is by far the best beginning out of any of these films (5/5), and when the storyline later ties the survivor's lives to the events of the first film, it's actually interestingly done.  Not as interesting as the deaths, though.  You've got a tongue-in-cheek apartment fire (4/5), a crushing visit to the dentist (4/5), and an unusually persistent elevator (3/5).  In one case, the jaws of life have the opposite function (4/5), and in another case a flying fence executes a mortal ballet (5/5).  There are also three explosive deaths that are a little cheap (2/5).  The characters this time around all get premonitions (again, mostly just false reflections in windows), and they spend a lot of pointless time trying to cheat Death's plan (their ideas mostly centering around a \\"new life\\").  The final scene, just as in the first film, is an over-the-top nyuck-nyuck moment.  \\"It's all in fun,\\" Death seems to be saying.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000FC2HS6 Final Destination 3]]:<br />This time around it's a roller coaster catastrophe (4/5).  The movie has a creative idea by putting the premonitions into poorly shot yearbook photos, and Death continues to get up in people's faces with ominous/ironic songs and smug little omens (before one death, characters at a drive-in watch as the word \\"control\\" disappears from the digital menu).  The first \\"catch-up\\" death in a tanning salon is perhaps the best of the film (5/5), although there's a nicely intricate set-up later in the film that involves a nail-gun (5/5).  A runaway truck and horse and a falling sign constitute some of the film's weaker executions (2/5, 3/5, and 2/5, respectively).  Elsewhere in the film, the movie's token \\"I'm Gonna Live Forever!\\" character battles death in a weight room (4/5).  The movie concludes with an intense subway scene that is kinda cool, but also sort of a rip off as far as endings go. (4/5)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001GCUO4I The Final Destination [Theatrical Release]]]:<br />The opener here is the weakest of the franchise.  It takes place at a racing track, and so all of the subtle connections and coincidences get lost in the sprawling chaos of the catastrophe (3/5).  The premonitions this time around are ridiculously aggressive hallucinations, and they forecast some rather uncreative demises.  One man is murdered by a tow truck in a way that almost makes sense (1/5).  Another character bites it at a hair salon in a rather unsatisfying fashion (2/5).  There's a clever little two-fer where two characters simultaneously battle watery deaths, although both are almost too cartoonish to be all that scary (4/5 - car wash; 3/5 - swimming pool).  The movie's real saving grace (aside from the 3D, which does its job without much fuss) is it's final theater/mall debacle, which is witty, self-referential, and fairly intense (5/5).  The close of the movie (and, ostensibly, the franchise) is an unceremonious vehicular accident that is only notable for the X-ray vision it is finally shot in./5), and an unusually persistent elevator (3/5).

Brilliant performances by Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry, just a delightful story of friendship and life in general.Expect to laugh, but keep the tissues handy too.
B000P0J0AG|5.0|What with Thief, Manhunter, Mohicans, Insider, Collateral, and even Miami Vice, it could be tres dificil to pick one. But Heat makes it easy. Mann proves you don't need complicated premises to show the story's complexity, he uses the characters to do that for him. And as a note, DeNero's perfomance is a beatifully tightly wound gem that shows the last time he really disappeared into a role.

It's all about how people have so many flaws, but at the end of the day, they are special and amazing... it's about seeing the beauty in life, even through the hardest of times.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I'm delighted to see Beatles remasters after 22 years of listening to the original 1987 CD releases. The sound is greatly improved and does not suffer from the more annoying fashions of many 21st century CD releases, such as the use of excessive compression to raise the average volume level.    Best of all, we finally have ALL of the Beatles' original mono masters on CD -- along with the original stereo mixes of \\"Help!\\" and \\"Rubber Soul.\\" This requires a bit of history.    When George Martin and the Beatles began making records together in the early 1960s, stereo was a fairly new thing. Most people did not have stereo systems, and AM radio, which was mono, was the typical way the public heard new songs. Because of this, the goal of the earliest Beatles recording sessions in 1962-63 was exclusively to make a good mono record. Two-track tape was used, with the instruments on one track and the vocals on the other, simply to allow Martin to balance vocals against instruments when mixing down to mono. He never intended the early Beatles singles or the first two Beatles albums to be released in stereo, and he was appalled when EMI did so.    Beginning in late 1963, the Beatles' records were made on four-track tape. Usually Martin recorded vocals on one track, guitars on another, drums on a third, and kept the fourth for double-tracking or any last-minute overdubs. (Later on, as the Beatles' music became more experimental, the situation got a lot more complicated, but this is how they usually did things in 1964, according to George Martin himself.) This makes a decent stereo mix possible, but the goal was still to produce a good mono mix because, again, most record buyers and all radio listeners at that time would be hearing the mono version. Stereo mixes were usually done at the tail end of the recording sessions, and usually tossed off fairly quickly, in much less time than was given to the mono mixes. Mark Lewisohn's book on the Beatles' recording sessions bears this out. So while stereo versions of Beatles albums beginning with \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" were made, the mixes generally weren't all that good, partly because mono was where the market was and also partly because Martin himself was learning by trial and error how to make stereo records.    All later Beatles albums up through the White Album were separately mixed for both mono and stereo editions, and both George Martin and Paul McCartney have said in interviews that they regard the mono versions as the better of the two. Over time, the stereo mixes got better, both because Martin was becoming more experienced at stereo mixing and because stereo was becoming more important in the marketplace and thus deserving of more careful attention in the studio. The \\"Yellow Submarine\\" soundtrack album, released in early 1969, was the first Beatles album where the mono version was simply the stereo mix collapsed to one track (effectively the same as pressing the \\"mono\\" button on a stereo system), and \\"Abbey Road\\" and \\"Let It Be\\" were released only in stereo.    In 1986 EMI finally got around to digitizing the Beatles' original master tapes for CD release. George Martin was not involved in this process, but when the CD masters were ready, he was invited to hear them and give his approval before release. He was disappointed to find that EMI had used stereo mixes for all the albums -- even \\"Please Please Me\\" and \\"With the Beatles\\", which, with instruments on one side and vocals on the other, hardly even qualified as \\"stereo\\" at all. He voiced his opinion that mono should be used for at least the first six Beatles albums. EMI compromised by using mono for the first four and allowing Martin to create new stereo mixes for \\"Help!\\" and \\"Rubber Soul\\" since he was unsatisfied with the original stereo mixes. Yes, you may not have realized it, but the versions of those two albums that you've been hearing on CD for the last 22 years are not the original mixes, but 1986 remixes!    Now we come to 2009and the new Beatles remasters in their Stereo and Mono boxes. The Stereo box contains all the stereo albums, even \\"Please Please Me\\" and \\"With the Beatles\\", plus the \\"Past Masters\\" singles collection. George Martin's 1986 remixes of \\"Help!\\" and \\"Rubber Soul\\" are the ones used in the Stereo box. The Mono box includes all the original mono versions of all the albums for which mono mixes were made, that is, all of them but \\"Yellow Submarine\\", \\"Abbey Road\\", and \\"Let It Be,\\" plus a mono version of \\"Past Masters\\" called \\"Mono Masters\\" that is missing a few late singles such as \\"The Ballad of John and Yoko\\" that were only released in stereo. So if you buy only the Mono box, you do not have a complete Beatles collection; at the very least, you would need to buy the stereo editions of the above-listed albums and \\"Past Masters.\\" The Mono box also includes, as a bonus, the original 1965 stereo mixes of \\"Help!\\" and \\"Rubber Soul\\", which have never been on CD before.    A few tracks are duplicated between the Stereo and Mono boxes (that is, the same mono version is used in both) simply because no stereo version exists. The original single version of \\"Love Me Do\\" (a different take from the one used on the \\"Please Please Me\\" album) is one example. This is consistent with the idea that the Stereo box, despite its name, is intended to be a complete collection of the Beatles' original albums and singles. The Mono box is also slightly mis-named, since it contains not only all of the Beatles' mono mixes, but also the original stereo mixes of \\"Help!\\" and \\"Rubber Soul.\\" But enough nit-picking.    So, all that said, what versions are really preferable? This is a matter of opinion. Some people, apparently, just can't stand listening to mono recordings, and others have sentimental attachments to the stereo editions; these people will probably prefer to bypass the Mono box and just buy the Stereo box. However, I find the mono editions generally preferable. For the 1962-63 two-track recordings, I find the \\"instruments on one side, vocals on the other\\" fake-stereo \\"mixes\\" unlistenable, especially on headphones. From \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" on, stereo is okay (though George Martin really did improve on the original \\"Help!\\" and \\"Rubber Soul\\" stereo mixes when he redid them in the '80s), but I find the mono mixes to be better up through \\"Magical Mystery Tour.\\" Stereo placement and balance is generally a bit off on many of these albums, and the greater care taken with the mono mixes really shows. What is particularly interesting is to hear how some songs actually differ in notable ways. To list only a few of the more obvious examples, the tape loops in \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" fade in and out at different times, \\"She's Leaving Home\\" is distinctly faster and a half-step higher in pitch in the mono mix, and the drum solo at the start of the \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" reprise is a little longer in mono.    The true Beatlemaniac, of course, will get both boxes (well, I did, anyway). After listening to all of both boxes, I think I will listen to the mono CDs more often than the stereo discs.
B002DKGWSE|3.0|Though this reworking of 1972's Last House on the Left-- that itself was a reinterpretation of Ingmar Bergman's The Virgin Spring-- may not quite reach the emotional impact and terror that Wes Craven's original unsettlingly achieved, this reimagining (for once that term has real modern justification) is perhaps the best version that could have been done by a major Hollywood studio for such a film of this narrative nature. As although the original is a fine example of underground novice filmmaking that won over a cult audience in grindhouses and on video, the 2009 version that hit major multiplexes in wide release adds its own unique take on the same story.     The original was about the rape and murder of two girls by a group of viscous convicts on-the-lamb is still the main facet of this remake's story... with a twist thrown in concerning the fate of one of the girls. The last block remains essentially the same too: the convicts end up at one of the girls parents' homes. The adults soon find out about who there guests are and take it upon themselves to get revenge.     Both films have a simplistic plot. Yet, where the original relied on contrivances to get its plot going, the 2009 version makes logical reasons for these strokes-of-luck and oftentimes the storytelling, if sometimes feels Hollywoodized, is much more natural and organic, that is, at least until the tacked on shock ending.     The film, even if it runs much longer, at nearly 2 hours still feels lean-and-mean. There are no scenes of policeman buffoonery like in the original and this 2009 white-knuckle version feels more like a work of an auteur than an amateur. However, the original still has a few major advantages over this remake.    Since the original was very low budget, and was directed somewhat pedestrian, its documentary style approach added both a sense of realism and sleaze to that shocker. In that way it made the film have a captivating, snuff quality to it that added to its take-no-prisonersapproach and made it downright disturbing.     Also, unlike the original, the 2009 version uses a big budget, and even if its director Dennis Iliadis has a great visual eye, he does not create that much fear even in the most ghastly scenes. Instead, the film feels more like an action picture, and due to its polish, it just does not have a kind of diabolical, dread-ridden atmosphere. Also, not even the most conservative right should really question the moral frame of mind he was in for making this picture. While Craven and Cunningham's venture took more of a nihilistic tone and defeatist approach that one almost could picture certain moral police groups think of them as sadists.    Moreover, in this 2009 version the villains are much more clean-cut looking and not as memorable. One must ask if one can one really find a better psycho than David Hess as the original's Krug? Probably not. Hess brought an aggressive intensity to his role that made him one of the most intimidating and scariest antagonists in all of film. Garret Dillahunt who plays Krug in the remake may do a good job, but it is not a particularly captivating one.     For that matter, really none of the cast in the remake leaves much of an impression. The cast is capable and natural, yes. Yet, despite an added half hour of character interaction, the cast just does not take it a step further with their parts. Thus making the 2009 film completely Iliadis' show.     When the credits role, one wants more Hollywood horror remakes to follow in this films footsteps. The film is much better than expected, especially given the subject matter. Yet, it also shows a horror fan something they have always known: the best go-for the-jugular fright pictures are always made underground and out of the system.      Grade: 7.0 / 10 (In 0.5 Increments)

B002BSHXJA|5.0|Just one thing to add here about mono -- you have to \\"learn\\" how to listen to it (or re-learn in the case of an old guy like me) to get the most out of it. It's really a brain thing, like seeing those trick pictures that you don't at first see because they are hidden in a pattern. But once you lock in, you can often get tremendous depth and greater involvement with the music than with stereo -- almost the way headphones seem to lock out the world sometimes. The EMI guys like Walter Legg, who recorded the great Maria Callas operas of the 50s, were the masters of mono, worked out of the Abbey Road studio. They  believed mono superior to stereo. I don't think they would necessarily say that today, with all the advances in technology, but they had a point -- mono can do most of what stereo does as well and sometimes better. And in fact, today's best stereo recordings are only slightly stereophonic, with only a minimal difference between channels to give a holographic effect. Yet oddly enough, the best mono recordings of the era achieved a similarly holographic effect through the judicious application of effects like reverb, double tracking and phasing. So it's really not a question of stereo vs mono, but skilled engineering vs less skilled. And these Beatles engineers were the best, and it really shows in these recordings.
0141439475|4.0|I think I bought my copy of Frankenstein when I was a Sophomore in High School.  Pretty sad that it took me until now to finally get around to reading it (I won't tell you how many years it's been *grin*).<br /><br />Based on my experiences with the multiple Frankenstein movies as well as appearances in cartoons like Scooby Doo and parody's like Young Frankenstein, I thought I had a pretty good feel for exactly what I could expect from the novel.  I was rather surprised with the widespread differences I encountered.  Looking back on my experience with Victorian literature in general and the Gothic literature of the era in particular, I should have expected what I found, but I had let myself be tainted by the mass media translation of Frankenstein.<br /><br />Now that I've sufficiently digressed, let me just say that even though the novel was different than I expected, I was far from disappointed by it.  I expected a terrifying horror novel filled with invigorating suspense, perilous adventure and chaotic frenzy filled action.  What I got was a slower paced exploration of the soul of man, the virtues and vices of science, passion, compassion and revenge.<br /><br />Initially I was very confused as the first many letters (the book had a LOT of 'correspondence' sections) had nothing to do with Frankenstein, his family or his creation.  Instead, I found myself growing attached to a lonely adventure seeker sailing to the far ends of the world in search of something to ignite and maintain his passion.  When our good Dr. Frankenstein does enter the story, we then get his very detailed narration of his life from childhood to present.<br /><br />The novel is laid out with a narrative structure intended to be highly conversational either through letters or through the orally delivered story of the narrator to the listener (who then transcribes it for us, the reader).  However, the language used seemed overly detailed and pretentious for a simple conversation, even from a speaker as highly educated as Victor Frankenstein.  It had all the flowery and ornate elements of Victorian prose, which feels natural as far as writing goes, but whenever I was reminded that nearly the entire narrative was to have been spoken, I was taken somewhat aback.<br /><br />The book portrayed very well the details of the exultation and triumph felt by Victor throughout his studies and his discovery of a method to create life.  His educational cycle was interesting in terms of his relation with his father and his professors.  When the realization of his action finally came about, Victor's agony, fear and despair were equally well realized.<br /><br />I kept waiting for the mob with torches and pitchforks to appear, led by Victor once he recovered from his initial shock.  Instead, the arc of the story presented itself to me and I felt compassion for the poor hated creature even before the novel presented him again for our sympathies.  I was certain that Frankenstein had falsely judged the fiend and that we would surely get a type of morality text casting a spotlight on society and our lack of compassion for those less fortunate for whatever reason.<br /><br />My next surprise came when Frankenstein came face-to-face with his creation and had a lengthy conversation.  I never expected an articulate monster, but what I had was a self-educated creature who had a huge wealth of knowledge at his disposal.  At that point, it was very clear that his only disadvantage was his ghastly appearance and we were obviously supposed to feel sympathy towards him.  Even when his crimes were laid bare, it was a struggle to completely condemn him.<br /><br />In addition to the commentary on human compassion, I enjoyed the dynamic between creator and creation.  Looking at Victor as a god-like person provided an intriguing perspective.  As the creator, what should his responsibilities be to his creation?  What should his involvement be?  I didn't necessarily go down a religious path with my thoughts, but I was curious about the concept of the creator as a provider of compassion, mercy and forgiveness.<br /><br />Instead, Victor looks \\"to the good of humanity\\" and rejects his own creation.  The result of which spirals into disaster and makes for a fun-filled ride filled with some degree of the action and suspense that I was expecting from the book (still no villagers with pitchforks, sorry).  When the novel finally drew near to its conclusion, I was a little confused as to how it was going to wrap itself up.<br /><br />The ending was actually strangely satisfying.  As it unfolded, we once again gain some compassion for the creature and in a sense look upon Victor as a type of monster.  As with anything dealing with humanity, it's not that simple.  For Victor was acting in the best interests of the greater  good as he perceived them and his logic was sound.  Thus, as the novel ends, we can't fully condemn either creator or creation.  At the same time, we can't wholly condone the actions of either.<br /><br />Which is why I was surprised that the ending satisfied me...because it left things unsettled and confused.  But after all, that's the way humanity is...a teetering house of cards, balanced precariously on a precipice, just waiting for something to turn emotions and values to chaos.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed Frankenstein and my only regret is that it took me so long to finally get around to it.<br /><br />4 out of 5 stars<br />****he creator as a provider of compassion, mercy and forgiveness.

B002GZQY6Q|4.0|when i discovered this band years ago it was partially due to searching out whatever happened to the other members of 'japan'. being a bass player i naturally knew what mick karn was up to, as well as david sylvian... i heard richard barbieri was in a group called 'porcupine tree' and decided to see what the music was like.   it was not love at first listen, but once it hooked me i became a fan of steven wilson. i now buy pretty much anything his name is on and have relly enjoyed most of it, even growing to like opeth quite a bit. i really appreciate his producing skill as well as his tendency to release 24 bit audiophile copies of his albums, which sound gorgeous coming out of my tube-driven sennheisers...   pt's albums have had the rare ability for me to improve with each listen, and also to improve upon the prior album... since most bands' first album is 'the good one' and all others get wistfully compared to it,( think appetite for destruction) i think it's amazing to hear a group who constantly grow and improve. porcupine tree have become my favorite band of all time...   this album came early in the mail last week. i bought the big box set and am thrilled with it... but i do have to say it isn't quite following in the tradition of 'even better than the last one' for me. it is really great, but the fun part for me is to discover all the tricky time signature things they do and make sound so easy, like in the middle of the song 'deadwing' where the band and the drummer are playing in different time, or the song 'fear of a blank planet' that always amazed me how the lyrics fit the odd metered music. i was particularly impressed with that... this album is really beautiful music, but it's pretty straightforward to me, and there are some moments where i want to skip over to get to the next song.   'blind house' 'drawing the line' 'the incident' and the awesome 'time flies' are highlights in an album i would compare with earlier works like stupid dream and lightbulbsun, both some of my favorite albums ever... but 'in absentia' 'deadwing' and 'foab' are just a bit above for me. these albums are in a place of their own...   as usual, gavin shines, richard creates lush dreamspace, colin plays bulletproof bass and steve wilson remains my musical hero.

Yes, they tried to cover a lot of ground in this movie, but overall I really enjoyed the flick. Jackman was great. Definitely one movie I'll be glad to have in my home library.
B002GY9F9K|4.0|I was very hesitant to watch this series at first because I was hearing so many negative things about it. (One of my friends even said it was one of the cheesiest tv shows she'd ever watched). But in the end I decided to give in and watch it. And i'm really, really glad I did. The Legend of the Seeker: Season 1 is a very entertaining, completely addicting television series. And while, yes, it does have its cheesy moments its still definitely worth watching. The main trio is thoroughly entertaining, funny, and enchanting. I love the chemistry between Richard and Kahlan and Zedd adds a lot of funny comedic bits.<br /><br />I am so glad that I decided to watch this series!!

For me, good effects are enough.<br />I have the DVD version, and it seems they change some effects to look more realistic. But as any movie before the bluray era, you can see a lot of details of the scenography.<br />Loved the extras, in fact, they are in a second bluray disc and it has more content that the DVD version.<br />If you like this kind of movies, like I-Robot, A.I., or Children of men, this one must be on your stand.

0385504225|5.0|Dan Brown's claim to fame was with a little book, which you may have heard of, called [[ASIN:0307474275 The Da Vinci Code]]. It's a tale of Robert Langdon, a symbologist who gets lured into an international mystery of the highest order. It was a flight of fancy, and great fun. After having read other follow up novels by successful authors, and being greatly disappointed, I was wonderfully enchanted by Dan Brown's newest Langdon tome, \\"The Lost Symbol\\".<br /><br />Certianly, this book will equal, if not surpass, the Da Vinci Code, in popularity, simply because being set in America gives it an immediate influence. Robert Langdon hooks up with a new female counterpart in the book, Dr. Katharine Solomon. Like the other two books, expect that the characters aren't really richly drawn, but more, caught up in the surprisingly fun and intrguing mysteries hidden in our nation's capital of Washington DC.<br /><br />The Freemasons, of which I know very little, but the Masons had a unique role to play in the founding of our country (many founders were Masons), are explored in this book. Like the whole \\"Holy Grail\\" phenomenon created by \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", I think that people, after getting their hands on this book, will be equally as intrigued with them. I can see many people standing with books in hand, walking around the buildings of DC trying to find said symbols.<br /><br />At any rate, the story is sometimes fantastical, sometimes outrageous, and always a page turner. I have to give Brown credit. He knows how to write a story. What made me groan a bit in his other books made me groan a bit here (especially in the much too clearly drawn characterizations) but still, it's an adventure story, written to entertain. And entertained I was!

B0000ACY0Y|4.0|Dear Amazon,    I'm  Belgian living in Brussels and my languages are French and Flemish (I mean Dutch). My english is not perfect, sorry. I bought three CD's of Gene Clark because it's impossible to find this kind of product here in Belgium. I am a great fan of american pop music, especially from the West Coast. I like especially country and bluegrass music too. Why Gene Clark, dead in 1991? I saw his name on the CD of Alison Kraus & Robert Plant \\"Raising Sand\\" (tribute to G. Clark, by the reprise of two songs \\"Through the Morning Trough the Night\\" and \\"Polly Come Home\\"). I already knew Gene Clark by the way of the legendary band \\"The Byrds\\" (he worked on the first and second records - beautifuf songs, \\"Set You free This Time\\" for example). I own allmost everything of the Byrds, reissued on CD's.One of the greatest American poet played once with this band, his name is Gram Parsons. Gene Clark is a great poet and musician too. He makes all,words an music. I recommend those three CD's from the seventies: \\"The Fantastic Expedition of Dillard and Clark/Through the Mornin, Through the Night\\", \\"Gene Clark\\" and \\"No Other\\". This last (1974)was \\"overproducted\\" (too much choruses, for example) - on the CD, I prefer the bonus tracks, the same songs musically lightened. I consider \\"Silver Raven\\" as one of the most beautiful songs I ever listened.     Jean-Claude
B002BSHWUU|5.0|these REMASTERING type of things are sometimes all hype but i do believe that these cds are a big improvement over the 1987 versions,listen to them side by side with the originals there is a big difference in the sound quality anybody with half an ear can hear that,listen to a song like I WANT YOU(shes so heavy)from ABBEY ROAD is riddled with distortion and horrid clarity issues the new version is pure and clear.YESTERDAY from HELP! has never sounded better.i think some sound better than others,i dont notice a great difference in SGT PEPPER but  ABBEY ROAD, REVOLVER, THE WHITE ALBUM,and the earlier cds that have been mixed in to stereo are a night and day difference than the 87 cds.give your ears a real treat and listen to the GOLDEN SLUMBERS/CARRY THAT WEIGHT/THE END medley its breath taking at some points.hey if your happy with your cds from the 80s keep em.but for real music fans buy the remasters its truly a worth while experience.

0833510800|4.0|\\"The Tempest\\" is treated by many critics as the equivalent of a home run during an aging legend's last turn at bat. It's a solid outing, no doubt, but after years of thinking this one of William Shakespeare's greatest plays, I regard it now more as moving curtain call than homer.<br /><br />Prospero is a banished nobleman who has learned magic while stranded on a mysterious island. With his faithful daughter Miranda, his obedient fairy servant Ariel, and his disagreeable slave Caliban, Prospero waits for the chance to confront those who left him for dead years ago.<br /><br />\\"We are such stuff as dreams are made on, and our little life is rounded with a sleep,\\" Prospero declares. Here the focus is on the fantasy part of life, the parts undreamed of in another Shakespeare character's philosophies, and the notion of imaginative power as the wellspring of transformation. It's all the more powerful coming from Shakespeare, writing what scholars say was his last play (circa 1611) and presenting himself in the character of Prospero breaking his staff, burying his books, and asking the crowd to release him with a final round of applause. How can that not be great?<br /><br />I thought it was one of Shakespeare's best, in part because it's such a great summing up of the Bard's life work when you get to it at the end of a college course on Shakespeare. But this time, reading it as standalone, I noticed more the flaws. Take the dullish romance between Miranda and Ferdinand. Or that rather odd play-within-a-play that elongates Act IV with verse so ring-ding some experts claim it was inserted after the fact by another hand to stretch what is otherwise a shortish eight-scene comedy. There's not a lot of plot in this play, and the lack of dramatic tension is missed.<br /><br />But what's stirring about \\"The Tempest\\" still stands out. The intoxicating atmosphere established from the first scene on the island sustains through the body of the play. I'm still amused watching Caliban deal with his two drunken \\"liberators\\", haughty Stephano and hapless Trinculo - Abbott and Costello in iambic pentameter.

Shakespeare often worked well outside the framework of religious orthodoxy, but this seems to me his most Christian of plays, and a success that way.<br /><br />\\"The Tempest\\" is a great play to watch when performed well, like it was on Shakespeare On The Sound three years ago in my town. But it's a hard play to read. The Signet Classic edition strikes the right balance between illumination and overexplanation, though the puns and metaphors seem more lost in time than they do in other Shakespeare plays.<br /><br />Everyone should read \\"The Tempest\\" themselves. There's the classic language, the beauty of its lines and phrases that echo down to us in common usage like \\"sea change\\", \\"what's past is prologue\\", and \\"O brave new world/that has such people in't!\\" And definitely try to see it performed on stage; it really comes to life there. Only if you're like me, just be aware a second reading might leave you a bit disappointed.rators\\", haughty Stephano and hapless Trinculo - Abbott and Costello in iambic pentameter.

0596522347|5.0|Visual storytelling can help presenters in the workplace. A visual presentation can complement technical and financial slides in a business meeting.  A presenter should balance hard facts with emotional slides to excite, even entertain your business audience. The worst sin of a business review is to bore your audience. As an instructor of executive presentation design and visual communication at China's top business school in Peking University, I can say with confidence that Slideology 'gets it'. For the price of two movie tickets, Duarte Design enables you to learn the vital skill of delivering impactful, visual stories. Technology has made PCs, digital cameras and editing software cheaper, consequently presentations have evolved from word slides and bullet points to video graphics and photos. Duarte Design helps understand these changes.  Slide:ology is the definitive book on how to design modern presentations.<br /><br />But critics are right, Slideology is not the right book to help you learn presentation delivery skills. The book also does not go into too much detail about how to create a presentation for different scenarios such as a business review, a pitch to venture capitalists, or a delivering a town hall address.  Useful books for learning verbal presentation delivery and how to converse with different audiences include: Maxey's 'Present Like a Pro', Toogood's 'The Articulate Executive'.  -Also to illustrate financial data, I recommend Few's 'Information Dashboard Design'. -[...]<br /><br />Why I think Nancy Duarte is qualified to write a book on presentations:<br />Like the title states, Nancy Duarte and her large professional team of presentation designers at Duarte Design know the 'art' and 'science' of visual storytelling. Duarte Design accumulated experience by serving the presentation needs of Silicon Valley's top firms for decades. Recently Duarte Design supported the top presentation event in the world, TED the Technology Entertainment Design Conference.

0439023483|4.0|I think what sets this book about from all the other young adults books on the market right now, is it's highly original concept. In the future the government has instituted a mandatory game that must be played by one male and one female from what are now twelve remaining 'districts' in what is left of the former USA. The contestants are chosen at random, are between the ages of 12-18, and the goal is simple: Kill all the others and be the last person standing. The 'game' is televised and is a national sensation. The book is about one girl in the group, Katmiss, and her fight to stay alive. A simple construct that play up the brutality and senselessness of war, Collins had definitely churned out a page turner for all ages. I have absolutely no idea where the second book will go, but am more than curious to find out.

B0029O0BKO|4.0|This review is for the Blu-ray, not the movie. Despite the lack of extras, save the original theatrical trailer (in SD, with Don LaFontaine doing the voice-over). The picture quality is truly excellent, putting the DVD to shame. When the movie starts and Linc Hawk is shown driving his big rig, you can literally see every hair in his beard, it is almost startling for a 20+ year old movie. Also, considering it wasn't made by a major Hollywood studio (it was made by Golan-Globus Productions), I wasn't expecting it to look this good. The audio is decent but not spectacular. While it would have been nice to have more extras on the disc, this is without a doubt the best the movie has looked since playing in the theatres in 1987. Besides, this is not only a guy movie, but also (part) chick-flick! An easy recommendation, not only for Stallone and arm-wrestling fans!
B00005YU1O|5.0|It must be a mark of how far out of the loop I am these days that I didn't hear about this film until now. On the other hand, like the main character, it seemed in a strange way to echo my own speculations on so many things. Perhaps that isn't so strange, for as one of the dream conversations points out, we are all interconnected at some level- that is why new ideas seem to pop up in many places at the same time and are soon mastered by the many. That is no doubt why this film popped up. I kept saying to myself  I've been here before, I've been here before...<br /><br />So many ideas are covered here from the nature of dreams, the nature of modern life, the nature of death, the nature of existence. The metaphysical ideas of PKD are even touched upon. Projects this intelligent usually do not get made since so few will really get it. But then, perhaps that it was made heralds a universal shift in consciousness.<br /><br />Some people will automatically reject this film as a sophomoric bull session. Those are the people with no curiosity about the underlying nature of reality. If you live in the sort of community where conversations never seem to get beyond knee jerk politics, weather, and football, then this film will come as a godsend.

0800177975|5.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***  Im one of those few people who got the joke. I got the joke back in 1993 when it came out. I know that this movie was meant to spoof those absurd action movies. Its these bonehead cookie-cutter critics that don't get that point. Bunch of pinheads keep saying the same thing because they allow weirdos  to dictate to them what qualifies as quality movies. Check out the negative reviews on this site. They all go along the lines of &#34;worst movie I've ever seen&#34;. Simple-minded predictable sheep. And now....... the review.  Premise: Daniel(Austin O'Brien) gets a magic ticket from a movie store owner given to him by Houdini. While watching the latest Jack Slater movie, Daniel gets transported into the movie itself and ends up joining Jack Slater(played by Arnold) in his crazy adventures. This particular adventure involves Jack finding out the killer of his brother.  Opinion: There are plenty of good things to say about this movie and very little bad things to say about this movie. The action is plentiful and the sets look great. That kid is annoying little wimp though(I must have watched this movie 10 times and still find that kid insufferable). The humor hits(the outlandish stunts, shooting TNT away with bullets, the hackneyed catchphrases, a funeral filled with strapped mob families etc). My biggest gripe with the film is that it has to constantly explain itself through that craven kid. Its obvious that Daniel is the voice of reason in this movie and what an annoying voice that is! Plus he is a major wimp. You mean to tell me that somebody breaks into your house armed with a knife, dares you to stab them in the back with the knife and you do nothing? What a wuss! Besides these flaws, this movie is still underrated gem that is worth picking up. A noteworthy satire on ludicrous action flicks and compared to the rubbish that passes for parody now(Date Movie, Epic Movie, Disaster Movie, Meet The Spartans etc)it holds up well after all these years.  I'll leave you on this note: Not every movie that bombs at the box office is bad and not every movie that succeeds in the box office is good. There are plenty of movies that failed at the box office that are good and there are some movies that succeeded at the box office that stink to high heaven. Stop being a trend-follower and see for yourself.  Last Action Hero: the most underrated parody of all time.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|This is by far...the BEST Megadeth album I've heard ever. The last time I've felt this good over a Megadeth release was 1992's \\"Countdown To Extinction\\".  Of course the Megadeth releases in the 80's were awesome, and 1990's \\"Rust In Peace\\" was killer. Even 1994's \\"Youthanasia\\" and 1997's \\"Cryptic Writings\\" was good, but they were lacking a bit in what Megadeth were in the beginning.  Well now after all of those years and Dave Mustaine doing all that he could regardless to whatever changes he had to go through and endure, he has created in my opinion the best Megadeth release ever.  Pure adrenaline, speed, heaviness and agressiveness. The guitar work, and other instruments performed here is nothing short of simply fantastic! The production is far better than Metallica's \\"Death Magnetic\\" (still an awesome CD though.)  This release is the best offering to anyone who never heard of Megadeth, especially the new generation that weren't around back in the day when Megadeth was at the top of their game years ago. Oh, and for all of you \\"old school\\" Megadeth fans,...the first track, \\"Dialectic Chaos\\" blows away \\"Into The Lungs Of Hell\\" from \\"So Far, So Good,...So What!\\"  Track 10, \\"How The Story Ends\\" tops \\"Ashes In Your Mouth\\" from \\"Countdown...\\" And track 4 \\"1,320\\" definately outruns \\"502\\" from \\"So Far...\\" Long story short, it doesn't get any better than this.  I feel like the Megadeth I knew years ago has been brought back alive and well into our time in 2009!!! Prepare for the \\"ENDGAME\\".  Prepare for the assault from the return of \\"The World's State Of The Art Speed Metal Band\\"...MEGADETH!!!
B001LF347E|5.0|Merlin was the best TV show I have seen in a very, very long time. Season 1 has me ready for more. I'm a Harry Potter fan so at first Merlin was a little take on Harry to me, but as the series progressed he became a completely separate character. Each episode grabbed your interest from the very beginning and kept it throughout. The commercials were unbearable for me so I'll really enjoy seeing this again when it is released on DVD. I enjoyed the absence of modern day programs with their swear words and sexual inuendos. This program was a pure pleasure to watch. I feel it was pure fantasy and pure fun. I would advise parents to watch with their kids to explain Merlin's magic. Thanks BBC for this program, thanks NBC for airing it!

1594202249|5.0|\\"It was like finding the gateway to the past unguarded, unforbidden because it didn't have to be.  Built into the act of return finally was this glittering mosaic of doubt.\\"<br /><br />Imagine a surfer-noir novel set in L.A. and environs in the spring of 1970 by Thomas Pynchon. Could anything be better? Answer: Inherent Vice is better! It's everything you could imagine, and then some. Every sentence is hugely entertaining, sort of the way Cormac McCarthy is entertaining, and also P.G. Wodehous. You just relish the diction. The plot is pure Chandler in its schematics: that is, characters are multiplied unnecessarily all for the dazzling color they give to the story; plot trots behind trying to keep up and just about succeeds in catching every character before they hit the ground. As in Chandler the characters who matter sort of only slowly emerge from the carnival, some very late: but that's the point of a carnival. Everyone matters to some gum-shoe or -sandal: we're concerned here with the ones that Marlowe or Doc are concerned with.<br /><br />And Pynchon is so different from the writers I've lately been thinking about, writers who narrate the experience of narration. Reading Pynchon is a little like reading Shakespeare or Hammett: I'm just a wide-eyed reader again, not a person figuring out the experience of writing this book.  I mean I am that sort of audience too for fun TV and Elmore Leonard and Neal Stephenson, for example. I like being just that. But for TV or Elmore Leonard I like because I can just enjoy the easy enjoyment of the thing. Whereas Pynchon requires -- no he doesn't require, he REWARDS -- the same kind of concentration I give Woolf or Geoff Dyer: a lot of concentration.  But there's something wonderful about not concentrating on the experience of the book as an act of writing.  You just concentrate for your own pleasure.  And, man, he writes a good last line.<br /><br />It's not that Pynchon as writer isn't an issue in the book.  He is.  But he's astonishingly good natured as a writer.  What other real writers are?  I can't think of any, not even Fielding.<br /><br />Anyhow the first half of the book (when it's explaining something) repeats  very occasionally -- sparsely even -- and very hauntingly two versions of the same phrase: \\"in those days\\"; \\"at that time.\\"  This plus a reference to Vineland as a place, plus one bracketed movie date at the end, are the only authorial self-references, the only sense that you have that an author is telling this to the reader instead of the voice coming off the page as part of the laid-back generosity of the narrative atmosphere.  I love those phrases.  They disappear from the second half, which is part of the very sadness the book's about: the end of an era, with Manson & Nixon (Doc must be called Doc partly as a descendent of Mason's, one of whose sons is called Doctor Isaac.)<br /><br />Doc is slightly younger than Pynchon himself, pushing thirty in 1970, as we learn in a great, casually sad passage:<br /><br />\\"Plastic trikes in the yards, people out watering the flowers and working on their cars, kids in the driveways shooting hoops, the high-frequency squeal of a TV sweep circuit through a screen door as Doc came up the path of the address he was looking for, to be followed by the more worldly sound, as he reached the front steps, of The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Hour.  According to Fritz, the sweep frequency was 15,750 cycles per second, and the instant Doc turned thirty, which would be any minute now, he would no longer be able to hear it.  So this routine of American house approach had begun to hold for him a particular sadness.\\"  (P. 199)<br /><br />Yes, I remember that routine.  I thought TV's didn't do that anymore.  But they do. Pynchon remembers this sound, which he can no longer hear, from forty-two years ago, when he reached the untrustworthy age of 30.<br /><br />And yet the novel is entirely without self-pity, which might be why some of the smartest people I know don't like Doc much as a character: he's not made for pity: the book doesn't pity him either, it just lovingly recreates \\"those days,\\" \\"that time\\" (\\"That time, O times!\\" as Cleopatra says) -- a time of endless betrayal as all times are for Pynchon, but a time when there were so many people to betray.  The stoned hippie belief in innocence is ridiculous and yet something to cherish.  Doc is cynical as all get-out, but still cherishes it, which means he's part of the innocence he's cynical about.  He gets all this and still likes his world.  You don't think people can really be like that?  Pynchon is.ity: the book doesn't pity him either, it just lovingly recreates \\"those days,\\" \\"that time\\" (\\"That time, O times!\\" as Cleopatra says) -- a time of endless betrayal as all times are for Pynchon, but a time when there were so many people to betray.

0307269981|5.0|OK, if you read Stieg Larsson's \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" jolt-fest, there is no way to skip this year's blistering \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire.\\"  But then you've got to wade through about 140 pages of \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" recap and kinky sex history of the cast - yeah, Stieg, we get it - Sweden is sexually liberated - before hunkering down to the really good stuff.  But trust me, this is a small price to pay as the prelude to the remaining 340 pages of over-the-top thrills and suspense, a rockin' and rolling mystery that would make the Vikings proud, a smorgasbord a violence and head games wrapped around the most interesting protagonist to hit the pages since, well, \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\\"<br /><br />That would be Lisbet Salander, the damaged genius created by the late Stieg Larsson for stopped too soon at a trilogy - the pierced and tattooed misfit with an extreme distaste for misogynists, a healthy disrespect for authority honed by years of institutional abuse, and a deliciously bad attitude.  In this installment, the author metes out in frustratingly small doses the brutal baggage that created the flawed brilliance of Salander, a cleverly - if improbably rendered- female combination of Kevin Mitnick, Bruce Lee, and Ozzie Osbourne.  Following the Blomkvist-Salander team that broke the decades-old Vanger mystery of \\"Tattoo\\" and Salander's subsequent heist of  corrupt industrialist Hans-Erik Wennerstrom which has left her financially independent, Blomkvist and his \\"Millennium\\" magazine take on a freelance journalist and his expose of a Eastern Europe-to-Sweden prostitution ring that catches a lot of pols and cops in high places with their pants around their ankles.  But when the researchers end up with bullets in their heads, fired from a gun with Salander's prints all over it, a frenzied media and biased prosecution team have all of Sweden looking for a slandered Salanader as the obvious perp.  But an eventually skeptical cop and the faithful Blomkvist stand by their maverick, setting up an over-the-top, sometimes poignant, mostly unbelievable, but always entertaining shock-lit romp through Europe's frozen playground of the north, never pausing long enough to note the irony in the tyranny of Sweden's social utopia theory against an all too real backdrop of heavy-handed state control which put poor Salander in her predicament in the first place.  Larsson zigs and zags through a number of unexpected twists and turns, through lots of stops in 7-11 (is Swedish cuisine so bad that 7-11 is really a preferred dining spot?) leading to the most white-knuckled climax since Josh Bazell's Dr. Peter Brown pulls a fibula in the frenzied \\"Beat the Reaper\\".<br /><br />Paradoxically, Larsson does not read like stoic fatalism of Scandinavian kin Irdridason, Fosset, or Nesbo, but rather more like the raucous, unapologetic, and graphically violent prose of Charlie Huston, Duane Swierczynski, or Adrian McKinty - high praise from this reviewer.  Yet Larsson has some axes to grind - violence against women, corruption, social injustice - but does so tastefully without beating the reader into submission with misguided indignities.  He wraps his thriller around a clever mathematical theme, adding to the depth and intelligence of a well-crafted novel that entertains on the surface with raw adrenaline, while satisfying less visceral emotions at a deeper level.  It is a shame that Stieg Larsson is no longer around to continue this refreshing and creative series, but I'll anxiously await the English release of  the final chapter in \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.\\"and by their maverick, setting up an over-the-top, sometimes poignant, mostly unbelievable, but always entertaining shock-lit romp through Europe's frozen playground of the north, never pausing long enough to note the irony in the tyranny of Sweden's social utopia theory against an all too real backdrop of heavy-handed state control which put poor Salander in her predicament in the first place.

0307454541|1.0|THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO, was extremely disappointing, in my opinion.  It went for pages and pages, blathering conversations, that had so little to do with the story.  The cast of characters was ridiculous, dozens of names that amounted to nothing.  Only a few were of any interest to the final outcome.  I love a good mystery, however, I \\"knew the answer\\" to this one so early on, it made the book quite boring.  A 600 page book, that could have been wrapped up in 200 pages, tops.  Sadly, I already have THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE .... I think I might recycle it.  It is sad this author died at such an early age, but I don't see how he could have continued as a writer for very long.  After a painful finish to endure, I did threw the book out.  Honest.

B0025KVLT2|5.0|Out of all the remasters I have acquired so far Rubber Soul is the best example of the difference in audio quality from the original cd reissues. Much of the warmth that should have been present has been restored and it preserves the Beatles at their creative peak (which of course would be under debate, \\"Rubber Soul\\" or \\"Revolver\\" would be to some). Aside from the essential quality of the remasters one can see a melancholy self reflection of \\"You Have to Hide Your Love Away\\" from \\"Help!\\" carefully thought over and brought to album length. Songs like \\"Nowhere Man\\" and \\"In My Life\\" capture the Beatles as a whole (which would be less evident on later albums as they all developed clearly different styles as well as the emergent diviseness that eventually brought them apart)reflecting on their career as pop singers and wanting to take their musical ambitions to a greater level. Its not just the fact that \\"Norwegian Wood\\" had one of the first uses of a sitar, its the knowing tongue in cheek cynicism that clearly had taken their song writing abilities one step further. \\"What Goes On\\", \\"Girl\\" and \\"You Won't See Me\\" clearly have a self reflective quality that wasn't evident in earlier songs and \\"The Word\\" predates \\"All You Need is Love\\" but is a superior song to me. The difference in appreciation in between generations isn't really as much as people think as the members of the Ramones and Nirvana had clearly stated the influence of the Beatles. If it was the obession of the rock critics then what else has changed? The packaging is fun (including the mock lp appearence of the cd) but its the music that counts as it always did and with the clear improvement I can't say what's a first purchase with the Beatles but \\"Rubber Soul\\" is among them and the remastered editions are well worth it.
B002C6K7N0|3.0|Well i will start off by saying this is the best thing Megadeth have done for nearly twenty years, the last great album being CORRECTION(Countdown to Extinction). That being said i've always been a fan of that line-up and the others were enh pretty good but never had that same vibe. Also the songwriting on Countdown was just amazing, as well as Rust In Peace which was a technical masterpiece, with great lyrics shadowed by small shady production. So why only 3 stars well minus two for poor lyric writing, and Daves low monotone voice, plain and simple. The music is heavy and definitely more technical than anything done since Rust, but the lyrics suffer from the same ole United Abominations throw down political babble. The one thing i hate about some of Mustaines lyrics past and present is that they are so literal in the sense that its like listening to CNN news. I've never been a fan of writers who use actual words like AK-47s, Smart Bombs, United States, Pocket Knife so on and so forth, one example is and i quote, \\"As they sit in the get away car, they had no other choice but to go for the bank\\". These kinds of lyrics are just silly and Dave just doesnt tell stories very well at all, and the song 44 minutes while some interesting guitar is probably the worst song i'm heard since Psychotron. However some of daves more casual lyrics like in This Day We Fight, Bodies, 1,320, and Headcrusher are very good and remind you of old school megadeth from the 80's. Forgive me for i have sinned but i really liked Cryptic Writings, Youthanasia and World Needs a Hero because there were some really good choruses on those albums, and i do prefer that. Don't get me wrong i love Dave and Chris together shredding but it does leave something to be desired and can be a little overkill, and i agree with other reviewers who say its just for the sake of shredding. Next you have Daves voice, while its never been the best(even close) out there its what makes Megadeth sound like Megadeth, not really sure if he can't hit highs anymore or just chooses to grumbling and snarl now, but in certain songs he with sing high and sound great but only for a few seconds. So in most songs you just get a low toned dave which makes you desire the olden days.         Something else about Megadeth you'll notice is Dave just can't get past the fact that he isnt in Metallica anymore after almost THIRTY YEARS!!! Even though Dave and all the musicians he's ever had blow Metallica to bits, especially with the master Chris Broderick on board now, he just still has to copy copy copy, not really songs, just ideas. Follow me here since Rust and you'll see what i mean.  1988-Metallica-....And justice for all-Great, techinical, long songs, poor tiny production  1990-Megadeth-...Rust In Peace-Awesome, there most \\"techinical\\", long songs, poor tiny production    1991-Metallica-The Black Album-Staight Forward, best production, best song writing, most commercially successful. Half the Album had Videos  1992-Megadeth-Countdown To Extinction-More Straight Forward, Best Production, Best Song writing, Most commercially successful. Half the Album had videos.(when Metallica disappeared for a while then came Youthanasia, sounded much like the black album).    1996-1997-Metallica-Load, sells out, changes image, more mellow, more versatile.  1997-1999-Cryptic Writings had already been written before Dave heard load so probably not much effect(good dave, orginal). Then 1999 RISK, Megadeths LOAD, only worse, changed there image, selling out didnt work.    2008-Metallica-Death Magnetic-Metallicas best album in nearly 20 years, more thrashy, faster songs, heavier songs.  2009-Megadeth-Endgame-Best THEY HAVE done in nearly 20 years, lots more thrash, faster songs, heavier than before.    Well if you notice the pattern you'll see what i'm saying, it seems when Metallica are IN the picture Dave feeds off what they do then tries to do it better or pretty much the same, thank god Dave didnt do a St.Angerso thats great. But when Metallica disappeared and only has had 2 albums since 2000, Dave had World needs a Hero, System Has Failed and United Abominations. So it was good to see Dave on his own with out an influence at all from Metallica, why he would want any from them now is beyong me. So even though its good to hear the good ole Dave back with a harder trash album than they've done in years, i can't help but think what he would have done if Metallica would have came out with a softer, less aggressive album.    Anyway i'm not bashing Megadeth, just a little tired of Dave, and a little tired of some of the music and ideas in general. While some songs seem fast, furious and new, some songs just seem like yep been there done that for the boys. I can listen to the key songs on this album but for some reason it starts to wane on me after a while. Not my fault.    Songs  Dialectic Chaos-8/10-Sounds very power metallish.  This Day We Fight-10/10  44 Minutes-4/10-Horrid Lyrics  1,320-8/10  Bite The Hand-8/10-Good Riff  Bodies-10/10-Good Chorus/Very Countdownish  Endgame-7/10-I wish dave would get off of the broadcasting intros, we know its u dave. How many ways can you say, weapons and surrender!!  Hardest Part of Letting Go-6/10-Good Sad key, daves voice doesnt cut it though.  Head Crusher-10/10  How The Story Ends-6/10  The Right To Go Insane-7/10-The main riff at the end of the song is drowned out by solos, everyone thought it was gonna be an actual song. Not so:(         So while this is definitely the best in 20 years, at what cost? Well lets just hope Metallica stays heavy and maybe Dave will too, he's 48 years old and still shreds, so get over it!! Listen to your music, its better than METALLICA!!! Btw-This album does make Death Magnetic look like Death Pathetic, especially with the dual solos. You sucketh kirk. Kind of a schizophrenic reivew huh? Well thats the way i felt when writing this.

Never people to just accept what others are saying about the Church, or to believe everything that's taught, we are thinking and reasoning believers in God. These stories, while definately fiction, have great moral lessons. In the end, you're left to decide for yourself who's the good guy and who's the bad. And if you are like us in questioning those who expect unreasoning obedience, these will pique your intellect. These stories definately demonstrate that absolute power corrupts absolutely, even when \\"they\\" believe they're doing the right thing.

0307277453|5.0|This book by Neil Shubin does a wonderful job of portraying how the diverse organisms on earth, both past and present, are profoundly related in their forms and functions because of a shared family tree stretching back to the origins of life, more than 3 billion years ago.  A central focus of the book is how humans are anatomically related to other organisms, but a wide variety of other interesting relationships are presented as well.<br /><br />Shubin crafts this rich portrait by expertly weaving together a wide array of details from many areas of biology including paleontology, comparative anatomy, evolutionary biology, developmental biology, molecular biology, and genetics.  In this regard, although I've studied plenty of biomedicine over the years, including graduate coursework in mammalian physiology, I was pleasantly surprised by how much fascinating new material I learned.<br /><br />At the same time, the book is very well written, with clear explanations and a narrative which often unfolds like a detective novel, so the book should be approachable by any general reader comfortable with science.  And speaking of detective novels, the book also does a great job of giving an insider's feel for how science is actually done, including the importance of persistence and luck.  I was particularly amazed by how often diverse lines of evidence turned out to tightly converge, thereby enabling Shubin to make a strong case for the various (and sometimes counterintuitive) ideas he presents.<br /><br />If I had to critique the book, I would prefer that it included more figures, used a somewhat more textbook-like format (to make it easier to go back and find information), and included more scientific terminology (to connect the book more with the terminology I'm already familiar with).  But, again, these are preferences, and the book is still excellent as is.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in natural history, particularly the evolutionary history of the anatomical developments leading to humans.  I also particularly recommend this book to people who have already taken a standard course in human anatomy, including health care professionals, since Shubin provides a different perspective which nicely complements such a course.  While a standard course describes the \\"what\\" of human anatomy, this book explains the fascinating \\"why,\\" including why we're anatomically predisposed to experience certain diseases (obesity, heart disease, diabetes, varicose veins, hemorrhoids, choking, sleep apnea, hiccups, inguinal hernias, knee problems, etc.).<br /><br />Also, readers may want to consider [[ASIN:0674418050 Human Structure]] by Cartmill et al for a much more detailed treatment of human gross anatomy (but no histology or molecular cell biology) in an evolutionary, functional, comparative, and developmental framework.velopments leading to humans.

B002NXQ0X8|4.0|It has a bit of old school voice sound in particular Scarlett in Relator has a sound of what I would expect on a 40's album. Then she also has some Nora Jones sound such as in Clean. The guitar and percussion are distinctly modern sounding and somewhat edgy. The songs do not have the repetition found in so many other bands.
B001PPLJIQ|4.0|I found this movie to be fairly gripping, partly because the time and place are somewhat unfamiliar (post-war Germany), and partly because the atypical plot has unanticipated twists and turns right up to the end.  Moreover, the scenery and acting are excellent, with Kate Winslet in particular doing a great job (as usual).<br /><br />The plot mainly revolves around a love story, but it's a love which starts out unbalanced and not entirely promising, undergoes a painfully abrupt separation, and then struggles without real success to regain a meaningful foothold.  And just when we think the love might finally reestablish itself in a less intense but more mature form, thereby giving some sense of closure, our hopes are instead permanently dashed.<br /><br />So, while the movie is certainly powerful and moving, sadness was the feeling it most lastingly elicited in me.  I felt pity for the character of Hanna Schmitz (played by Kate Winslet) because she paid dearly for her overblown shame, unexplained insensitivity, and excessive naïvet&eacute;, factors which unwittingly made her both a victimizer and victim.  And I also felt pity for the character of Michael Berg (played by David Kross and Ralph Fiennes), who started life with so much promise but never managed to recover from his broken heart, to the detriment of other relationships which he could and should have nurtured.<br /><br />In the end, although this movie was made well and has strong entertainment value (of a serious sort), I didn't really learn any life lessons from it, and feeling sad isn't what I look for in a movie, so I'm rating it four stars instead of five.  But I can still recommend it to people who somehow find sad love stories to be appealing ...
B000ZEE3I6|2.0|I thought the Order of the Phoenix was the most outstanding movie of all time. The soundtrack to it plays in my car daily. When the release of Half Blood Prince was delayed I thought I would go crazy waiting. With incredible anticipation I filed in with the masses to see it when it finally hit the theaters and much like the Goblet of Fire, was immediately disappointed by the absence of the Dursleys. And then who would have thunk it, but no Voldamort either. The last thing I was hoping for was a teenaged hormone-ladened skit. Though at times, Harry's humor was semi-entertaining, the only true Potter parts were the scenes with Malfoy. Quite frankly, the entire story line in the movie was irrelavent to the series. And the fact the 7th book had long ago been released ( and read) took all the guess work out of this movie. We already know why Snape killed Dumbledore and that Snape is the unsung hero. It has taken me this long to write a review for the sheer fact I was having trouble admitting the movie was a failure. Even the music score was pieces taken from past movies. Will I buy the DVD when released ? Of course. I own each book and movie and will most likely watch this movie again hoping that since I know it stinks already, I won't be so disappointed.
B002C6K7N0|3.0|This album is heavy for the sake of being heavy. Yeah, it's a shred fest, but again, it shreds for the sake of shredding. The key element missing from this album is the typical high quality songwriting we are accustomed to from Dave. The riffs become overshadowed by the relentless, masturbatory solos, and the vocal melodies are thrown in to keep the album from being an instrumental. If you are a guitar player, this album may be a dream come true, but for those hoping for an album of solid songs, it falls short.
B0025KVLTM|4.0|I love the Beatles. I love good audio. The thought of new and improved Beatles got me to purchase 3 remastered CDs (Rubber Soul, Sgt. Pepper and Abbey Road) on the first day of release. After listening with my trusty Sennheiser HD580 headphones, what's the verdict?<br /><br />Listening to the re-mastered CDs is like looking out a window that has just been cleaned. The view is the same, but it is sharper, with more detail. The SOUND is the same, but there is more attack and decay (the 'shape' of the beginning and end of sounds), especially on vocals and acoustic instruments.<br /><br />The sound stage is more spacious. McCartney's bass work on 'Day in the Life' is more melodious. 'Lovely Rita' has even more little hidden sounds at the end. When Lennon says 'bye' at the beginning of the Sargent Pepper Reprise it is clearer.<br /><br />So what's not to like? Nothing, really. It does not feel overproduced, compressed or 'sweetened'. It feels like the record the Beatles would have made with better audio equipment. It's not going to bowl you over. It's the same music. It just sounds better.<br /><br />Some people have said that they cannot tell the difference between the two versions. I have a pretty good audio system, and the difference was noticeable, but not dramatic. If you have a lower end audio system the differences may not be worth the purchase price if you own the original CDs.<br /><br />But if you don't own the CDs, for goodness sakes, the remastered version is better. And if you have a pretty good stereo, the difference is worth the price of admission.

0439023491|5.0|I confess, I ignored The Hunger Games for months.  I figured it was another author's feeble attempt to pull off some zombie/vampire/werewolf novel a la Stephanie Meyers.  In the months following the release of Breaking Dawn, I'd become weary of searching the bookstore's shelves for something decent to read.<br /><br />But after reading the reviews on here -- and noting, with some surprise, the lack of one-starred reviews -- I took the leap and bought The Hunger Games.  Figured I'd return it in a day or so after reading it.<br /><br />I was bewildered.  Then excited.  Then...<br /><br />There are no words that could fully describe how good these books are.  I've read both books in two days.  Suzanne Collins is brilliantly amazing!  Her books will forcibly pull you into the dark nation of Panem.  You will not just read, you will EXPERIENCE what happens in each chapter.  You will become a fellow citizen of Katniss.<br /><br />To avoid giving away any spoilers, I'm just going to review the experience of reading.<br /><br />I guess the main concerns for readers would be A) these are violent books, B) there is no fluffy romance, and C) some of what you read could be classified as horror.  Allow me to address these:<br /><br />A) Yes, these are violent books.  But the main character is not out to hurt people for the sake of killing.  She really isn't.  She's technically a pawn in the hands of a dictator, yet every action she makes is calculated to either save her own life or the life of someone she cares for.  These books are about weighing the costs between survival and sacrificial love -- for example, Katniss throws caution to the wind in The Hunger Games when one of her friends, a little girl, is screaming for help.  Rather than remain hidden, Katniss bursts out into the open and sprints to her friend's side.  The scene that follows is grippingly powerful and reaps longlasting effects on the people of Panem.<br /><br />B) Yes, there is no fluff.  That's because Suzanne Collins has effectively created a heroine who actually deals with realistic feelings.  There is literally no time for Katniss to sigh blissfully over the butterflies in her heart, or how drop-dead gorgeous Gale is, or whether Peeta's biceps are larger than Gale's.  She does not go into endless, lustful daydreams.  If anything, she shows embarrassment at nudity, which is refreshing.<br />There are, admittedly, moments where she recognizes the thrill of love.  Katniss will confess when she finds someone physically attractive.  The nice thing about her is that she balances the physical with the personality.<br /><br />So, yeah.  No sugary sweetness.  No fluff.  But true love?  Yes.<br /><br />C)  The horror factor:<br />Yes, these books do have an element of horror.  But what I find encouraging is that the horror is not without hope.  Katniss has something to fight against and she has allies.  That, to me, makes all the difference between a random bloodbath like Final Destination and something a little more poignant like Gladiator.<br /><br />Altogether, these books are the best I've read in a looong time!  I think the way Suzanne Collins ended Catching Fire was remarkably bold -- and I'm wondering now how I will ever last till she brings out the next book!  Five million kudos to Suzanne.  You've turned me from cynic to fanatic at the turn of a page.Collins has effectively created a heroine who actually deals with realistic feelings.

B00005GL0Q|5.0|I got two CDs from amazon through their 3rd party sellers.<br />I already posted a review at their site for Abbey Road [import Japan]-2000 and got a scathing comment asking why I posted a review in the 2009 issue site.<br />The heading is: Be above the remastered fray with this Japanese import.<br />All I can say is that amazon has a bad habit of cross-linking reviews between different issues, so when someone posted a review on one CD it show up on a lot of other versions.<br /><br />I bought it new for $28.90 USD including S/H.<br />The first thing I noticed is that it didn't sound different in MP3 format in iTunes (320kbps, VBR highest quality) then the Revolver [UK] (Capital)-1990 reissue.<br />It's only noticeable when you play the CDs in your stereo system.<br />There is no problem with 'brightness' and 'loudness' that  some Customers complained about on the new 2009 reissues.<br /><br />The new 2009 reissues have simulated a lot of us to go over our Beatles collection and that's not bad.<br />Some people have complained about the 'loudness' and all you have to do is check an excellent article at wikipedia's site on ' loudness war ' to see what the huffing is all about.<br /><br />MY ADVICE: Do a mental innovatory of the most importand albums that were 'the soundtrack' of your life as I did and ask yourself if you want the BEST SOUNDING version and decide on which one to get.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: I'm very pleased with the import that I got.
B00003CXSP|1.0|They went totally overboard with the blood and gore factor for this so called sequel to \\" The Silence Of The Lambs\\". As much as I admire director Ridley Scott, he got into the blood and gore way way too much. If you're a hardcore Hannibal Lecter Fan, stick with the first film \\" The Silence Of The Lambs\\", and if you haven't checked it out yet, see the prequel to it \\" Red Dragon\\". If you have a weak stomach, don't watch this movie. I don't have a weak stomach, and I gagged at the part where Hannibal cuts the guy open and he hangs him from the terrace and the guys intestines fall out on the ground, The infamous brain scene was sickening to. Not a worthy sequel to \\"The Silence Of The Lambs\\".

B001DJLCPO|5.0|This is a children's movie that is equally meaningful and enjoyable for any adult whose mind is open to the fantastic. For children, it is so much more than empty entertainment calories. There are some very tough issues: mainly, an adolescent girl coming to terms with her mother's mortality, and her very mixed feelings towards her parents - the feelings that adolescents naturally have. Parents should watch this movie with their children, and talk about it. Other reviewers will comment on the sheer genius and creativity of the animation -which is better in blu-ray. I especially loved the way that amidst even the most fantastic images the people remained so real - immersed in a landscape of archetypes. Comparable movies: really nothing is quite like this, but in how one can through fantasy speak about difficult things in a common language to both children and adults, I would say Miyazaki's Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, and Howl's Moving Castle, both of which are pure anime.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|To be concise, this album is good because:    - Great production  - Extreme technically - fast shredding guitars, elite technical guitar playing, lots of solos, varying tempo changes  - Varied song structures keep the songs interesting  - Good melodies  - Dave is angry, his subject matter is ok at worst and great at best  - Bodies is a great throwback to megadeth's old material  - A quality drummer (i dont need to make the comparison)  - Plenty of songs that will blow you away live

B001GCUO16|2.0|The Blu Ray format really shines when you're watching \\"tentpole\\" flicks. I'm talking Spielberg, Bruckhiemer, Scott (Ridley or Tony) or Snyder. Blu Ray was made for big budget action movies that push the format to give the best possible sound and amazing special effects displayed in glorious 1080p resolution with 7.1 High Def audio. With the release of the first big summer action flick of 2009 (Watchmen not withstadating), I was at least looking forward to watching a pretty terrible movie in it's best possible resolution.     ouch.     Origins is the prequel to the hit and miss X-Men franchise starring one of the most popular characters in Marvel's universe. I'm a comic fan. Not an uber fan, but I do still try to keep up and have read some of the origin stories of Wolverine. There is no getting around the fact that this is just a very poor movie that makes little use of some amazing source material. Hugh Jackman does what he can, but the story is so lame, it falls flat. Liev Schriber looks scary enough, but again, story and direction derail. And there's the introduction of two of my very favorite characters, Gambit and Deadpool. Both are perfectly cast (Ryan Reynolds will be Deadpool again and Gambit may be done), but niether have enough screen time to justify the hype. I won't spoil the end, but will say that Ryan Reynolds excels and being a smart mouth. He's playing a character that is a smart mouth. Ladies seem to love him (at least my wife sure does). And Currently, he's surpased Jackman and is the biggest star in this movie. So what do the filmakers do? Replace Reynolds with a speechless body double to fight Wolvy. LAME.      Poorly choreographed action and terrible special effects round out the film. Enter the mighty Bluray. What looked bad in the theater looks horrendous in high def. Like Indiana Jones:Crystal Skull, the special effects actually take away from the movie. The one thing that had to look good were the claws. No exaggeration, they look like the plastic toys. They are REALLY BAD. This is a case where I might suggest a standard DVD to cloud up the visuals. The sound is solid, but nothing remarkable. Special features are standard, nothing new to note and it has what is becoming standard, a digital copy.     I'm a huge fan of the summer blockbuster - I'm not a film snob by any stretch. I give Wolverine 2 stars for great casting and a good job by Jackman. Unless you are a collector of all things X-Men or have a middle school aged boy, I don't reccomend this movie.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|I've only listened to this once so it may be too soon to hail this album as their masterpiece. But it may very well be. Once pigeonholed as Radiohead clones with each album Muse releases it keeps getting harder and harder to say that with one's integrity in tact. Muse is their own band and they have combined the bombast of Queen with the vulnerabilty of Radiohead for a while...but there's so much more to this band than that. They can be gloomy/moody, anthemic, atmospheric and that's just the tip of the iceberg. Now they have added classical music into the mix in a tasteful, exquisite way. Listening to tracks such as Uprising or United States of Eurasia and of course the mindblowing Exogenesis suite(tracks 9,10 &11) among others and then simply writing them off as knock offs of this or that band is doing them a great diservice(as well as yourself). Listen with an open mind and you may find yourself slackjawed at the genius of this band.

0783225857|5.0|Finally--reading a classic I have long ignored. Not purposely, but simply because life got in the way--raising a family, working two jobs, dealing with setbacks and disappointment, trying always to rise above the roadblocks, to make it all worthwhile, and even have some fun, along the way. There were years when my passion for reading took a back seat to being a wife, a mom, a part of the work force that keeps society moving, money in the bank account. Reading never stopped, but time became a luxury I often had to steal for an occasional book. Today, when I might have three books going at once, plus all the internet information I can devour, bliss is mine. Now, as I read To Kill a Mockingbird, I'm beyond sad that this feast was denied me so long. Given the current, woeful state of the world, of national politics, reading this book has provided me a deeper well of comprehension of racial realities of which I was aware, certainly, which offended me, throughout my life. But this small jewel of a book has cracked my mind open in a way nothing else ever has, driving home again the immense power of books to reveal, to define reality clearly, in yet another light. I will be giving this book as gifts for a very long time.

B001PPLJIQ|4.0|The film was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay as well as a nomination for Kate Winslet for Best Actress and is based on Bernhard Schlink's novel of the same name.      It is the story of a young fifteen year old boy on the verge of sexual maturity, Michael Berg, living in the days of adjustment in Germany in the few years following World War II. He comes from an upper-class home with educated parents. While coming home from school, he becomes sick and vomits on the doorstep of a woman who helps him get home. This woman, Hanna, is a central character in the film. He has scarlet fever and after 3 months recovers from the illness, but something about the woman has captured his attention, even when he was ill, and he returns to thank her for her kindness. This somewhat unlikely pair begins an affair. Michael has a sexual awakening but also full romantic attachment to Hanna. She on the other hand seems very isolated and her motivations are more dark and uncertain.  When Michael complains about school, she invites him to read to her and soon they are making love and reading on a regular basis. The two go on a picnic where Hanna asks Michael to read the menu for her. Both Hanna and Michael are physically beautiful and the attraction seems natural even though she is twice his age. But then Hanna disappears and moves out of town and Michael is totally heartbroken as only a young first love can be hurt. We see him interacting with his peers, becoming sexually active, but always a bit more aloof and removed and unreachable than his peers. Many years later, while attending law school, he enrolls in a seminar that requires that he attend some trials of war criminals and sees that Hanna is one of those being prosecuted. It turns out that Hanna was a prison guard at a woman's prison where a terrible fire broke out and the guards would not release the women, condemning them to death.  At this point, it appears that maybe Hanna was seeking something innocent and fresh in her love affair with Michael, a sensation that could not last as she tries to escape her past and her guilt. Thus for her the affair was about lust for a beautiful bright and innocent young man as a way to regain her own lost innocence.      As the trial proceeds Michael is ambivalent in his feelings toward Hanna, having a difficult time separating the anger he feels for her leaving him with the anger he may feel for her war crime.  He is not caught between his own feelings of right and wrong, for he knows what she did was wrong. He is caught between his personal anger toward her for running away and his more intellectual concerns around the crimes and her role in them.    Michael will need to forgive her to emotionally move onward with his life. During the trial, Michael learns something that could make a real difference in the length of Hanna's sentence. Yet he does not act and there is considerable ambivalence here for we are uncertain if he fails to act because he wishes to protect Hanna's dignity or because he has yet to forgive her and thus is removed from her fate. There may also be a bit of revenge acting here as Michael has information that could impact the sentence given to Hanna and yet he withholds the information.     But if we are unable to forgive, who do we really hurt?  Michael was once a victim of an older woman who had sex with him as a boy and then left him when he was most in love. But the inability to forgive Hanna turns Michael into his own tormentor.      Director Stephen Daldry does a perfect job at capturing the cool world of post WW II Germany. Kate Winslet and David Kross are excellent. Ralph Fiennes is the only disappoint for he plays David too coldly, too icy, too removed and emotionless. Once again David Hare has done an exceptional adaptation of the novel into the screenplay.     The film is thoughtful, well acted, beautifully photographed, and remains a rich puzzle even after you have seen it to the end.
B000000OAL|5.0|This is by far Queen's best LP.  The vocals, harmonies and guitar work are a hard rockers dream.  Go for it!!!!
B000LE16VW|5.0|God Bless the family and fans of Patrick Swayze he will not be forgotten and we were hoping for a miracle.  He was a strong and beautiful man and fought a long fight (which is rare for pancreatic cancer and very painful).
B0002O06N0|3.0|Still a hazily good indie-blues time, some of the gritty authenticity and engaging, fuzzed out simplicities which made the band initially embraced start sounding routine here, beginning to run out of steam with a decidedly limited sonic palate.
B00005JPKE|5.0|This is not a war film that will be accessible to every viewer, especially those who are only used to soaking up the typical American propaganda war films of the past half century. Of course there are going to be those right winged/ 'wannabe pushovers' who will automatically be persuaded to call out this film as: \\"rewriting history,\\" when, in reality, they have NO clue/ concept of what actually occurred during this part of history from the POV of the Japanese soldiers, (and still consider any \\"enemy\\" to the US as nothing more than \\"savages.\\") The fact of the matter is, the film is a true masterpiece of artistic cinema. Many people seem to forget the notion that film = art. \\"Letters\\" is NOT a documentary film; it is a filmic portrait of a generally unknown/misunderstood piece of modern history. I would say this subtle masterpiece is Eastwood's best work to date.  Though I am sure there are those who would disagree.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|I will start by simply stating the fact that no matter what you are doing, if you play this CD you will immediately start head-banging uncontrollably.  So I write this to give fair warning. For example:    [situation]...  >    ... [Result]  Running on a treadmill...    Headbanging  Unconscious in the street... Headbanging  Making love to your wife...  Headbanging  Riding the bus...            Headbanging, possibly against the seat in front of you.    The reason Dave is pictured making that snarling face on the back of the album is because he was listening to it when the pic was taken and it's physically impossible not to make that face for the CD's entire duration. (again if you sneak earphones to class and then listen to ENDGAME you will inadvertently make that face towards your teacher and she will probably call security). Trust me if you happen to come across a mirror while listening to this album, you will notice you are making the exact same face.    Good luck, because Endgame is so good you will probably run into these situations despite my warnings.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|Stardust is amazing.  It's full of adventure, the characters are wonderful, my kids LOVE IT and we could watch it over and over again and never get tired of it!!!
B001K3JF7K|5.0|On the bonus features from the DVD \\"Live in Rio,\\" Diana describes this CD as a love letter. She expresses that on this CD. It's a love letter from the other artists and arranger, producer, and everyone else involved too. The lush, lazy, quiet spaces in this music resonate with me and my wife. If you're looking for high energy bop you need to look elsewhere. This CD is entitled \\"Quiet Nights\\" for a reason.  Give it a chance--it grows on you with multiple listenings.  It helps if you listen when in a quiet mood.
