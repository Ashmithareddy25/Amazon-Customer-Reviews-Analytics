B005OCHOZS|5.0|Even if you don't care about ultrarunning or know anything about the sport, Eat & Run can be an entertaining and thought-provoking read.  It's more than just a story about a man who has been one of the most dominant ultrarunners in the world for the last decade, it's about a man who seeks to transform himself through dedication to his sport, a conscientious way of living (especially through diet) and searching always for greater insight into himself.<br /><br />Jurek began making a name for himself in the ultrarunning scene in the late 90s, when he first began winning big ultrarunning events.  He was featured in Christopher McDougall's bestseller, Born to Run, as he was one of the gringo runners who went up against the now-famous Tarahumara Indian runners in their native land.<br /><br />The book is entertaining as it details all the tribulations individuals go through who engage in extreme sports, who push themselves beyond limits most of us can't cross -- and do it time and again as a way of life.  The book, though, is also compelling as biography, and Jurek comes across as an unpretentious guy who comes from simple, working-class roots who had to deal with many challenges early in life (an overbearing father, relative poverty, a mother who was sick from MS) and because of those challenges, became a fierce competitor with a drive that is admirable to say the least.<br /><br />The format is a bit quirky, with chapters about running mixed with recollections about youthful experiences and then random vegan recipes sprinkled throughout.  There's also a lot of reflection/introspection, as Jurek melds existentialism with the runner's and vegan's way of life (without being preachy).  The fact that Jurek is vegan is initially amazing for what he puts his body through, but it makes sense once you understand that Jurek's whole approach to living is about simplicity and purity.<br /><br />The book was a great read and inspired me to re-think some of my own limitations.  I think it could do the same for you.

B007D2XSW0|5.0|I'm having a blast with this app!  The features are easy to figure out and it has more choices than I think I'll ever be able to use.<br /><br />Pictures load fine from the gallery and I haven't had a force close like others.  The only thing not working for me is the login to my Twitter account, but that's a small inconvenience since it saves to my SDcard which is accessible to all my apps.

B00139XTG4|2.0|The author has a good idea, and finds evidence to support that idea and lets you gradually into his thinking however the idea was worth, maybe, 30 pages and would have benefited from a more balanced approach. Comes down to being overblown, polemical and, worst of all, boring.

B005LAIIS0|3.0|I have come to realize that most movies are not going to be realistic.  It makes watching a movie more enjoyable once you accept that<br />That being said this movie is no exception.  Many people have already pointed out the things wrong so I will not go into those here.<br />I thought the movie was thought provoking in the respect of what a person's emotions go through when dealing with death and loneliness.

0061692042|4.0|This is not an action book. Other than the opening, and you wildly turn the pages looking for answers, it is written in hindsight... the narrator grown and looking back with both his naive present teen self and thoughts, what he should have known or watched out for (his very adult self), and how it all played out. It is a beautifully written, painful, portrait of a child (helpless) left to make a life for himself after his parents decide that the only way out of their despair...is to rob a bank. !!!!  Yes, and then the portrait of the criminal mind, or in their case...the lack of development of one.<br /><br />I did enjoy it after I quickly realized we would be focused on reflection (of a life lost), what it means/meant...how it worked out okay. And along the way very much introspection about life, death, good, evil, and all that. Heavy. Tons.<br /><br />Still, I liked it. Richard is an astute writer, has wonderful command of the written word but I sure felt like I wanted to sit down and see some mindless comedy as I turned the last page.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I am surprised that I liked this book.  It is now one of my favorites.  I ended up really loving the character Travis.  I loved the passion and certainty that he had for Abby.  Yes, he was over the top, but in fantasy land that's Okay. I even loved the tattoo in Hebrew that said, \\"I belong to my beloved, and my beloved is mine.\\"  This is a great summer read.

B005LAIGPA|4.0|Chronicle has your average young superhero movie origin formula, however they play it off with much better effect. The story revolves around three highschool kids that find this meteor or something underground and it bestows them with telekenesis. Two of the kids want to keep it as a little hobby they do with each other while one of them, after going through years of abuse, wants to use his powers for his own purposes.<br /><br />Chronicle's age old story was told really well, where the villian Andrew here is really fleshed out well as a sympathetic character, making his downfall that more tragic. RedLetterMedia pointed out that this whole story is essentially the same as the Star Wars prequels and yet it tells the story with much more conviction and excitment in less than 90 minutes, suck on that Lucas indeed. Alex (I think?) is Andrew's more popular cousin who tries to help Andrew out with his social situation, and Steve is the charismatic school president who happens to be with them when they discover the rock, all of them seemed stereotypical but it was the little flourishes here and there that made their characters more convicing than they should've been.<br /><br />The only real complaint I have though about Chronicle (and everyone else has covered it there and back again) is the found-footage style, it didn't really seem necessary to tell the story and it wasn't consistent. The first scene Andrew explains to his drunk dad that he bought a camera and is recording his dad being locked in his room, so what's he going to do with the camera, send it to the police? No, he's going to carry it around with him everywhere, recording everything. Why? Is he so lonely that he films himself? I've never heard of people doing that before. Also Alex's love interest happened to be a blog personality online that also happens to film everything, very coincidential for a movie that plays itself out for realism. Then near the end there's a few camera shots like when Alex opens his eyes after laying down with the police around him, there was no camera filming that, so they didn't even keep the 'found footage' style consistent.<br /><br />What they should've done instead was pick and choose what to film 'found footage' like and what not to, like when Andrew pushes the car into the river there's no reason he would've grabbed the camera in real life, so scenes like that just film them naturally, it's not a big deal if it's not all completely found footage. Some parts were interestingly shot too, like the final 'confrontation' was all shot through onlooker's cell phones or cameras, it was definately innovative and looked realistic, but I wanted a little more. So again, cut to some people's camera persepctive then cut back to the action, well I don't know, it was still damn good and I'm rambling again.<br /><br />Anyways Chronicle was entertaining the entire way through which is a gem of it's own, not one second I would say was filler. All the 'hataz' that say it was dumb teenage angst crap it's not, teen agnst is kids with first world problems brooding about getting grounded or something, Andrew had real problems and issues. And for the people saying it was slow: seriously? Anyways for normal people tired of seeing the same Superhero origin crap being vomited out into movie theaters everywhere Chronicle takes that concept and puts a new spin on it making it interesting again, definately worth a look.eyes after laying down with the police around him, there was no camera filming that, so they didn't even keep the 'found footage' style consistent.<br /><br />What they should've done instead was pick and choose what to film 'found footage' like and what not to, like when Andrew pushes the car into the river there's no reason he would've grabbed the camera in real life, so scenes like that just film them naturally, it's not a big deal if it's not all completely found footage.

B0000B1OGD|5.0|Anyone who is fond of Ray Harryhausen stop-motion animation (also called \\"Dynamation\\") will obviously enjoy this flick for the very fine but typical  special effects.<br /><br />Although this is a \\"Cowboys Meet the Dinosaurs\\" flick - which is a novel idea, it follows pretty much the plots of earlier \\"captured giant monster\\" movies, most notably \\"King Kong\\" and \\"20 Million Miles to Earth\\".<br /><br />However, this one is a bit more entertaining because there is a backstory about a struggling Wild West show. Perhaps it is struggling because it's taking place IN the Wild West, or almost, if Mexico counts. They'd probably draw a better crowd back east in New York!<br /><br />It is through accident that the cowboys running the show discover the dinos in the \\"Forbidden Valley\\". (Didn't that become the name of a salad dressing?) There, they meet Gwangi (the star of the movie) whom they hope will save the show - or eat it - whichever comes first.<br /><br />It is in this backstory that we get to meet some interesting and charming characters, and this is what makes the movie for me.<br /><br />We have good main characters - Tuck (played by James Franciscus who does a very nice job as hero), T.J. (played by Gila Golan) the show's owner, main attraction and Tuck's love interest, Champ (played by an aging Richard Carlson who doesn't really have that much to do), Professor Bromley (played by Laurence Naismith with a British accent) and Lope, the enterprising Mexican boy, played by Curtis Arden.<br /><br />Since the dinos are very predictable in their look and behavior, it is the backstory and acting that carries the film.<br /><br />Franciscus is cast as a kind of lover boy/hunk. Yes, they get his shirt off in one scene and we get to see Gila Golan change clothes behind a screen in another. We also get to see them kiss, but only after explaining they want to marry, have kids, and start a ranch. This is a G-rated film, after all!<br /><br />Franciscus carries off the role pretty well, but where he shines is in his scenes with Lope, the Mexican boy. He never talks down to the kid or treats him as an \\"extra\\" (as often happens in movies of this type that have a kid - See \\"7th Voyage of Sinbad\\") and shows genuine concern for the kid's safety. He also is believable as a semi-rogue in his affections for TJ, his love interest. Theirs is an on-again, off-again relationship, with both succumbing to the allure of fame and fortune over their mutual affection. He plays well with the Professor, acting the foil while the Professor explains the more complex concepts of paleontology so we as audience can believe in Wild West Dinos.<br /><br />TJ really could be more developed (as a character, not physically, she is very well developed along those lines). She lacks the toughness of a hard headed business woman and show owner. But, her vulnerability (and naivete) make her a good foil for Tuck. If she had been a stronger character, their relationship would have carried more interest.<br /><br />The Professor is convincing as an opportunistic scientist, but he's never an evil scientist, just one whose scruples can be \\"adjusted\\" to meet his goals. The Professor also provides a bit of comic relief. What is missing from his character is that he does not act as the voice of science, reason or compassion for the dinos and their treatment. The script isn't that advanced (we don't see this type of intelligent behavior until Jeff Goldblum and Sam Neil show up in \\"Jurassic Park\\"). Nevertheless, he is a fun character to watch.<br /><br />Sadly, Champ (Richard Carlson, the veteran of sci-fi flicks), has little to do in the movie other than act as a father figure to TJ, although at times it seems he may have a love interest in her as well, even if it is only platonic.<br /><br />They say if you want a hit, stick in a kid or a puppy, or better yet both. We don't get a puppy here (does a cute little tiny horse count?), but Curtis Arden as Lope, the enterprising Mexican boydoes deliver the charm.<br /><br />Of the animated characters, Gwangi is by far the most alluring, if voracious. For some reason, most Hollywood dinos and similar giant monsters seem to have a different way of behaving than we would expect in the natural world. Gwangi is no different.<br /><br />We are supposed to believe he is an Allosaurus, a prehistoric predator. Obviously, Gwangi is hungry and in search of food. However, when he grabs and kills a smaller dinosaur (poor thing - the screaming is not pleasant to hear), he only takes a few bites and is then off to chase the smaller but far more interesting cowboys (it's the equivalent of taking a bite of a steak dinner, then chasing down a bowl of popcorn). Realistically, one might think the creature would ignore them and drag his meal off to eat it completely. But then it would be HOURS before we get a dino-chases-cowboys scene!<br /><br />While this movie is pale by comparison in violence to modern dino flicks (of the Jurassic Park type), it is none the less disturbing at times. This is thanks to the sound effects more than the action.<br /><br />There is only a minimum amount of blood and carnage shown, which one would expect from a movie of the late 1960's. However, there is one scene that is supposed to be a shocker, but comes across as almost amusing in spite of its violence.<br /><br />Gwangi is revealed to the public, chewing on a dwarf! Although this is meant to be shocking, and it certainly is memorable, it's so expected and over-the-top that it just made me laugh. The amusement isn't helped by Champ's (Richard Carlson) look of shocked dismay and his command to his boys, \\"Hurry, get the curtain down!\\"<br /><br />The real violence in this movie is aural. There is plenty of agonized screaming from creatures and humans alike in the killing scenes. It shows what a good sound crew can add to a film without falling back on gore and red dye glop gross out effects or ominous music blasts from the orchestra.<br /><br />Of course, in the end of the movie, Gwangi must be eliminated since the scientist has failed to argue a reasonable treatment of this remarkable and unique creature. We can't have Gwangi running around loose for obvious reasons, so he must die in a convenient, if accidental fire.<br /><br />Here the film falls back on the older favorites, \\"King Kong\\" and \\"20 Million Miles to Earth\\", but with Gwangi screaming and suffering a horrible death in the burning building.<br /><br />There is a sense of pity for the poor dino, who was only minding his own business eating other dinos before the meddlesome cowboys captured him. There is a blatant sense of unfairness here, made more poignant by the look on the actor's faces (Franciscus, Golen, Arden) as they hear the sounds of the dying creature.<br /><br />The films ends here leaving some questions.<br /><br />Who is going to pay for all the damage to the Town?<br />Will the scientist launch a new expedition to \\"Forbidden Valley\\" (in search of salad or dinos, whatever).<br />Will Tuck and TJ ever get married, or will they wind up in jail for all the havoc caused by their capture and mishandling of Gwangi?<br />What are they going to do with a giant rotting dinosaur carcass?<br /><br />Okay, I am thinking WAY too much for this film.<br /><br />Films of this style aren't big on logic or reason, they are meant to thrill and entertain the audience without requiring too much thought. In this respect, the film stands up to its contemporaries. However, it is a bit disappointing because the script has a good backstory and characters, and with a little more effort (or perhaps courage) on the part of the studio and writers it could have been a pioneering film, even one with a message.<br /><br />Instead, it succumbs to the formula method and fails its potential. Nevertheless, it is a fun film, a bit above the others of its kind, with fun performances by the actors.does deliver the charm.<br /><br />Of the animated characters, Gwangi is by far the most alluring, if voracious.

B003HYSSZK|3.0|I really enjoyed the first four seasons having watched them all over the last month. But I must say that I am having a hard time connecting with the latest Dr. Who and his companion Amy. I know this is all personal preferences. I'm sure others love both of them. I should've never looked ahead to see if there was going to be a season 7 and who would be The Doctor because unfortunately for me, it is still Matt Smith. I'm up to episode 10 of season 5. Hopefully by the time I get to streaming season 6, I'll have been won over.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the games are really fun. I love them! they have some classics. and some are original. I wouldn't dream of ever returning this
B00846TTDG|5.0|Loved it. Watched it a couple of times already.  The acting is about as good as what you would get in a Power Rangers episode, but we knew that going in.  No big deal.  The only thing I think they missed was that the role of the Senior should have been played by a real actor.  I would have loved to see what a Jack Nicholson or Robert De Niro could have done with some of those lines.

0891419063|5.0|The content of this book defies description.  At numerous occasions while reading this memoir I had to stop and remind myself that all of these things truly happened.  When combat veterans talk about the inability of noncombatants to grasp war, I believe I have a slightly greater appreciation for what they mean.  I noticed that my mind tended to lapse into the book like any other story of fiction, except the indescribable horror, blackness, and utter hellishness that Mr. Sledge describes was all too real to him and the front line men he served with whose blood, viscera, and innocence stained the corral and mud of the many islands they fought on.  His descriptions in the book are so strong and unforgettable that for very brief moments of time the fog of fiction that clouded my mind was lifted and I found myself shocked beyond words.  For example, one passage that evoked in me a great feeling of sadness and remorse for the innocence these men left behind on our behalf came when Sledge stared down at a Marine corpse, he says:<br /><br />\\"Every time I looked over the edge of that foxhole down into that crater, the half-gone face leered up at me with a sardonic grin.  It was as though he was mocking our pitiful efforts to hang on to life in the face of the constant violent death that had cut him down.  Or maybe he was mocking the folly of war itself: \\"I am the harvest of man's stupidity.  I am the fruit of the holocaust.  I prayed like you to survive, but look at me now.  It is over for us who are dead, but you must struggle, and will carry the memories all your life.  People back home will wonder why you can't forget\\"\\".<br /><br />We who have never fought and tasted the bitter essence of war can never know, and thank God for that.  But if you want perhaps the slightest inkling of why Sledge and men like him can't forget, read this book.  Just read this book.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is a book that I've heard about for a while and wanted to read it.  I borrowed it once from my school library, but I had to return it before I could finish it.  Once I got my kindle I decided to get the Hunger Games and I'm VERY glad I did. The book takes place in North America in the future.  After a rebellion starts in the 13 districts against the Capitol (that's how it is spelled in the book), the Capitol fights back and wins.  All the districts are beaten preety badly, except for the 13th district which was completely destroyed.  So the Capitol creates the Hunger Games in which two people, one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18, from each district must compete in.  It's a battle to the finish as only one can win.  I don't want to spoil the book, so I'm just going to tell you that it is a very good book, one of the best books I've ever read (the other series that I love is by the same author), and you won't be disappointed with this book, especially if you are a fan of action, science fiction, and a little bit of romance.  If you read this series and like it, I would recomend that you read the Underland Chronicles, which is also by Suzanne Collins.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I'm sure it's a fun game to play with your friends! then I realized I have no friends......so it was pointless. oh well!
034580404X|5.0|Trust me I'm not a \\"reader\\" but I had heard so much on TV talk shows, etc. about the \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" that I had to look for it. I found that Amazon.com had the best deal with no shipping charges for all three. I ordered all 3. I couldn't put the books down. Really kept my interest. E.L. James is to be commended for her great writing ability. My one girlfriend has read the first two and now I can give her the third to read since I just finished it. I have another friend who wants to read them also. Now I hear there are rumors that a movie is going to be made as soon as they find the right actor to portray Christian Grey. I hope it happens.
0345525558|5.0|I loved this story. It was a little slow to start for me, but there was enough to keep me reading.  But once I was several chapters in I was fully involved and after the half way point I had trouble putting the book down.  Some have commented that they didn't like the end.  I'm not sure why.  I thought it ended nicely.  A little predictable but who cares. I also saw people mention that they didn't like the characters.  I thought they were wonderful. Not picture perfect people...all with flaws.  Isn't that how people really are? The chapters bounce back from past to present, which I really enjoyed.  A great read.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|...who need a flaky, poorly written novel to rev up their sex drive.<br /><br />My question is this: Once the \\"glow\\" of 50 Shades wears off, are the same women who love this novel so much planning on allowing their husbands/bf's 30 minutes of \\"computer time\\" every day? And please don't say there's a difference between the two. This book isn't nearly written well enough to be considered quality lit, or even quality erotica.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it was a great way to pass time while by the pool your always doing something new; would reccomend it yo everyone who needs fun
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|it was a lot of fun.!  I really enjoyed how involved this was for a free app.  thanks for being so creative.
0393088774|5.0|every American should read this insightful book. Paul Krugman knows what will end this depression and tells it in terms everyone can understand
B0071WQ7WU|4.0|\\"Don't be delicate... be vast and brilliant\\" says the booklet to Shinedown's fourth album, Amaryllis. And the album does come close to brilliance. A band whose success rides on being accessible for radio and the casual listener, Shinedown have managed to create their own sound without acquiring any rough edges. Sure, there's the unnecessary profanity in \\"Nowhere Kids\\" and \\"My Name (Wearing Me Out),\\" for example, but the songs themselves are coherent, intelligent, perfectly executed and produced.<br /><br />Coming after the highly successful album The Sound of Madness and \\"Diamond Eyes\\" single, Amaryllis is undeniable evidence that Shinedown have found their niche. Shinedown always had a knack for writing both hard rockers (\\"Fly from the Inside,\\" \\"Heroes,\\" etc.) and more emotional songs (\\"45,\\" \\"Beyond the Sun,\\" etc.), but now they make great songs consistently with very few missteps. Unlike most modern rock groups, their ballads and mid-tempo songs always have tolerable, if not good, lyrics. The rock songs are always very strong, as well, and everything is carried through by fabulous vocalist Brent Smith.<br /><br />Shinedown's debut had some great songs, but its weakness was the bleak atmosphere contained throughout. Us and Them shed some light lyrically, and then The Sound of Madness was practically a rebirth. The fabulous sound of The Sound of Madness (partially due to Rob Cavallo, no doubt) remains entirely intact on Amaryllis, and it has been slightly improved. Critics of Shinedown have complained (probably without having heard \\"Fly from the Inside\\" or \\"Lady So Divine\\") about lack of interesting instrumentals  - Amaryllis will likely silence them. Lyrically, the songs are general enough for individual interpretation, with enough emotion and honesty to be interesting and worthwhile.<br /><br />\\"Adrenaline\\" is an exciting opening number followed by \\"Bully,\\" which basically dwarfs \\"Adrenaline.\\" \\"Amaryllis\\" is a perfectly placed ballad, followed by \\"Unity,\\" another great mid-tempo song - all of the first four songs contain guitar solos courtesy of Zach Myers; another highlight is his back-and-forth stomp and squeal on the next track, \\"Enemies.\\" Barry Kerch's drumming shines most in \\"Adrenaline\\" and \\"Bully,\\" and Eric Bass does a great job on bass throughout the album.<br /><br />The album may be a bit top-heavy, but it is better balanced than The Sound of Madness in terms of dynamics. As an added bonus, Wayne Bergeron can be heard screaming on his trumpet on \\"I'm Not Alright.\\" \\"Miracle\\" is a beautiful ballad and essentially the epitome of why Shinedown have so much pop appeal. \\"I'll Follow You\\" is a simplistic but effective number that sounds very much like Black Stone Cherry - a band with whom Shinedown toured while promoting The Sound of Madness. With the exception of the mediocre \\"For My Sake,\\" every song is fully formed and has a clear sense of purpose.<br /><br />Shinedown's fourth album proves without a doubt that The Sound of Madness was not a fluke. Amaryllis cements their place as one of the best rock bands today. Shinedown are only going to get bigger from here.<br /><br />Recommended: \\"Adrenaline,\\" \\"Bully,\\" \\"Miracle,\\" \\"I'll Follow You\\"<br /><br />4/5great mid-tempo song - all of the first four songs contain guitar solos courtesy of Zach Myers; another highlight is his back-and-forth stomp and squeal on the next track, \\"Enemies.\\" Barry Kerch's drumming shines most in \\"Adrenaline\\" and \\"Bully,\\" and Eric Bass does a great job on bass throughout the album.<br /><br />The album may be a bit top-heavy, but it is better balanced than The Sound of Madness in terms of dynamics.

B007D2XSW0|4.0|This app is so much fun with all the different choices you have for editing photos. Sometimes it gets a bit glitchy with fish eye but besides that I have not had any other problems! It works great on my kindle fire and my friends all enjoy it too.
B0086700CM|5.0|WOOOO Who ever says they dont like it hazz problems!!!! theres nothing rong with this app!!!!! If you dont like it its cuss your kindle hazz problems !!! its sooo funn and VERY ADDICTING!!! WHEN YOU FIRST GET IT BE WARNED YOU GANNA GET ADDICTED!!! XD
B0086700CM|5.0|i think this game is verg addictive and you can get better the more you play.  ilove it so much
B003H9MSPG|4.0|Pros: It has sniper-like qualities: the gun is the longest of all Nerf guns, it has two scopes to increase target aim, and it has a stable and comfortable butt.  It can hold two extra magazines, which totals 18 bullets at once, it is very easy to reload and cock, and it looks awesome.<br /><br />Cons: It does not shoot 35 feet like it says. Furthermore, when the barrel is attached, the shot accuracy and bullet distance go down.  However, when the barrel is removed the accuracy and distance are slightly better, yet it still does not reach 35 feet.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game. it helps pass the time over the weekends. my sister and I play it all the time
B006OCM0G0|4.0|why the heck are people whining about this game?it's very nice and it has no foul words. I'm 8 and I learned a lot from it and now I'm making breakfest for my family...ON A STOVE!
1934030198|5.0|For a Novice, this book was very informative, helping me realize the importance of solid training. It separates typical fitness from true performance on race day.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|This runs very well on my Fire.  Although the graphics are very minimal in nature, they are very supportive of the game play and challenges presented.  As the course difficulty increases you are faced with choosing between risks and rewards in ways that really put you to the test.  Even when I am playing badly this game is a lot of fun!  Put yourself to the test - play WITHOUT the power ups!
B004GYY714|5.0|I love this app! I looking for a certain radio station, and I found it!!! Then I tried finding my local radio station that I love, and Tunein Radio had it!!!! I over this app! &lt;3 :)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have enjoyed this app greatly.  Has helped in getting me back into reading my Bible.  Recommend using it for the ease of daily reading.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I can't say anything bad about this app. It works perfectly on my Bionic. I'm glad I took a chance on this FAOTD.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|95 years ago Edgar Rice Buroughs (the author of Tarzan) wrote a 5 book series about the adventures of John Carter on Mars. Disney has made an excellent adaptation of the first book; \\"A Princess of Mars\\"  If you have ever read any Edgar Rice Buroughs books, I am sure you will like this movie. If you enjoyed; Star Trek, Star Wars, Avatar or Firefly, I would think you'll enjoy this tale of an arizona prospecter (after serving in the civil war) who kills an alien and is accidently transportd to Mars.  It has adventure, romance, monsters, aliens, and mystery. I sincerely hope that Disney makes movies of the other 4 books, and not stop there but continue making movies of; Edgar Rice Buroughs Venus series and Pellucidar series.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great app to take a break with. quick easy games but not too easy one gets bored quickly. great twists on some real classics.
B000BT97AO|5.0|This disc was in great shape when it arrived.  The movie played great and was just as awesome as the first time I watched it.  It's definitely not for the younger kids, though, my godson had a hard time keeping interested.  Not disappointed at all!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is like mario next best thing to it they need to get more games like it love it
B007P3TMW2|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, great story line. Tom did a great job, and Sandra performed very well. And the kid was outstanding, his acting was superb.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|So far I'm pretty impressed with this app. It's the first photo edit app that I've found that I like in several years of using android devices and I have a background in professional photography. It got a little hung up during the save process on one photo so far, but nothing that I couldn't deal with.
0345803485|5.0|Straight erotica is usually not my thing but when I heard this book had been banned in the libraries in my state, I knew I had to read to see what all the upset was about.  This book is definitely not straight erotica, it is a perfect romantic story for women.  It covers all the areas that we so love in our stories, seduction, innocence, the leading male character needs the leading female character, intrigue and yes, some naughtiness.  I could not put the book down and I could not wait to get the other two in the series.  Now I am sharing the books with my friends.  I hope E.L. James will continue to write because I would love to read more.
B002RHL8DC|5.0|This was one of the best Stargate shows. Characters were much more complex and you loved them in one episode and hated them in another. The show was a space opera in many aspects including the great distances they traveled as well as characters being killed off. It was a shame this didn't run many more seasons.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was a refreshing delight for me to read. It had a romantic story line with an edge. I would highly recommend this book.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is fun and it kinds feels like the original Mario brother game<br />thanks for making it I really miss the original Mario bros
B003O86FMW|5.0|The second book in the hunger games trilogy is wonderful. It has new twists and adventure with some romantic ideas. I would highly recomemd this book!
B002MQYOFW|2.0|I got tired of the premise about 1/3 of the way through the book and put it down. My main complaint about this book is with e-books in general. They started off as a very economical way to read. Now they cost more than new paperbacks and almost as much as hardcover books. I can buy \\"like-new\\" paperbacks from Amazon at about 1/4th the price of an e-book. It appears to me that once the big 3 felt they had a \\"hooked\\" audience they increased the price. I paid for this ebook, did not like it and cannot resell it. If I buy a paperback or hardcover I can easily sell it. If I had this knowledge prior to buying an ereader, I would not have bought one. as I read one or two books a month I am going to go back to buying used paperbacks.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is the second book of the trilogy and it is much better with the relationship between the two lovers. Love this series, can't wait until the next series!
B002KS1IJC|4.0|The movie is better than you might think. It's essentially The 13th Warrior meets Alien, with the weird cult marauders replaced by an alien monster.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|I really like the app .. it works great on my Samsung galley s2 ..the only thing i would think it needs is to scroll for the effects instead of having to go back to try the other ones . Other then that a great app!!
B0053TMP24|5.0|Rick has done it once again captured my attention. As we all wondered where the Percy Jackson crew were now The Son of Neptune answers our plead.
B008CP93S0|5.0|I didn't think it was too raunchy. It reminded me of some great times when I was younger and free. A feel-good movie. Not for those who are uptight about drugs and sex.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|not the best game in the world but not the worst. I get easily bored but this is keeping my attention for the moment.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is fun! there are a lot of different games and most of them dont suck. i like it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this game has always been a favorite... it's been around for years yet it NEVER gets old!!!!!!!!!!  Now I'm teaching my daughter how to play it, and she loves it :)
0345803485|1.0|Save your time and money and pass on this book! Im not even sure how this book has become so popular. The writing is horrible! The story line is non believable... could say more but its a waste of my time!
B006P0FIGU|5.0|Not your regular type of swashbuckle movie.A lot of funny lines.To much romance in it for me.No it is not my type of an adventure film.
0345803485|1.0|Haven't you people ever watched a good old fashioned porn movie. A bit if advice. Skip the seventies and early eighties. Too much hair.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Have a Samsung Galaxy and have had fun playing with the edits and embellishments. Could load from my Gallery with no problem.
B006W33UC4|5.0|A must have. This set and these remixes are the best...if you were there, or you just like GREAT 70's music...this one will be a benchmark for your collection. I have no regrets on this purchase.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I was surprised, especially after reading all the negative reviews. Very robust on Samsung Nexus. Like others mentioned at first I couldn't find where my edited pic was stored but by digging around a bit it was indeed stored in my camera folder. Sweet little program.
B000QRIGJY|4.0|Another great saga.  I can't believe how I am cruising thru the Harry Bosch Series.  I can't get enought....Love the writing style and love the stories....
B0054JZC6E|4.0|lots of different kind of simple games. I love that you can earn new games by playing games rather than having to buy more games, though that is an option. I'd like the games to give an explaination on how to play but most are self-explainatory and maybe there is a how-to and I just haven't seen it.
B007TNQ7EY|3.0|is this game better or worse than 9 mm???  I cant tell I love 9 mm its do awesome and Sos this game can someone tellbme
B007PTJOV0|5.0|once I start I just can't stop. its totally addictive and a lot of fun to play. it's just amazing.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Worked great both with gallery and camera pics.  Renames each save so you don't lose the original picture.  Saves to gallery or post to twitter /facebook.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|I only tried this with one gallery pic on my Toshiba Thrive and it easily gave me access to all the gallery pics. The effects and filters were quality options. I don't know if it is worth the asking price but suspect it probably is since it seems the dev plans on updating it regularly.<br />Give it a try.
B0086700CM|5.0|I can play this game for hours, I drain my battery playing this game. I recommend it to anyone. I love it, it is a fun game for everyone. You should get it. :)
0802714544|5.0|John LeCarre is one of the few authors ever that has been capable of writing a book that is both a suspenseful, thrilling page-turner, and at the same time satisfying literature with interesting and believable characters.<br /><br />This book is fascinating, fun, and satisfying. Like all of LeCarre's books, you will NEVER see the plot twist coming.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, read this book.
B00650SSDU|4.0|This is a romantic comedy for sure, but it is well deserving of its \\"R\\" rating.  It could be called a sexual comedy as these two are more interested in getting into bed rather than anything else.  Mila Kunis is cute and easy to watch, and Justin poses and postures for the camera. Once was enough for me and I will pass this CD on to someone else to watch.
B006CUDDUG|5.0|John LeCarre is one of the few authors ever that has been capable of writing a book that is both a suspenseful, thrilling page-turner, and at the same time satisfying literature with interesting and believable characters.<br /><br />This book is fascinating, fun, and satisfying. Like all of LeCarre's books, you will NEVER see the plot twist coming.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, read this book.
0345803485|3.0|There are good and bad points about this book.  I have to agree with the 1 star people, it does seem like it was not well reviewed before it was sent to print-there are errors that do interrupt the flow of the book for someone who is nit-picky about grammar and word usage.  However, the book is a work of fan-fiction and it is good for what it is.  How it became something that almost everyone is talking about, from around the office to on the hard rock radio, I am a bit lost at.  I will read all three books so there is something there.<br /><br />Read it if you have a few spare days available to you.
B001GM28HO|4.0|When I think of pop music, I think of upbeat songs, fun dance music, catchy hooks and good melodies. Many pop artists can achieve these standards with a good producer and recording team. But what makes Lady GaGa surpass the average pop diva is that she has powerful vocals and lyrics with substance. That, combined with the aforementioned pop elements, makes 'The Fame' one of the best pop albums in the last decade. I remember when this album was released, you couldn't turn on your car radio without hearing Poker Face, Just Dance, or LoveGame. And you couldn't help but sing along whenever they come on, or get up and dance whenever they played at a club. Her soulful voice captivates the listner too, and makes her songs that much more enjoyable. Her unique image makes her music intriguing as well -- as she brings something different and original to the pop scene. The album also has a distinct theme that it follows throughout. The songs are all about fame, love and money...and how these three concepts and elements are often connected and intertwined.<br /><br />I don't particularly like the slower balads on the album, which is why I've given this album 4 stars instead of 5. But I'm still a fan, nonetheless. If you enjoy good pop music, I would give this album a listen. Two thumbs up.
B005U9RQNU|5.0|I have been hearing about this show for years, but never took the time to check it out. Well, the saying of \\"saving the best for last\\" is an understatement. I was hooked line and sinker from season 1 episode 1. The plots/story lines are well written with a lot of twists and turns. I haven't been on a roller coaster ride from a tv show since 24! This show is so intense it delivers each and every time. I can't wait till season 5. The ending of season 4 was...WOW..genius!!! Walt is more than meets the eye. Don't let the geekness fool ya. When he stood over that dude and shot him point blank... that let me know that he has a truly \\"dark\\" side to him.
B004SKHJF2|3.0|In order for this to work, you have to be right up on the audio source. Like when I'm in my car, I have to hold it up directly to the speakers which kind of defeats the purpose for me: if I'm at home, I can put random lyrics in a search engine and find the song. On the car radio, usually the title of the song is announced after the song is played.<br /><br />If I try to use it at a club or bar, it never works and that's when I need it the most.<br /><br />No way would I pay $5 for this. I can find song much easier on my browser by typing in lyrics than this app can so what's the use of having it? I'd say it only works for me 50% for me.<br /><br />No, I wouldn't recommend this.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game is really fun.I liked it.It has minigames to play and a town to build.It has to be one of the best games I have ever played.
B0083SBMBM|3.0|The movie is a good movie not great. It made a lot of money beating out Harry potter in revenues.  How I don't know.  Ii was a little board at some points of the movie and if u watched Thor, how did they figure out to get Thor to earth when he destroyed the only way to get off his planet. Could have been better for me.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I love this app! I tried the free version and loved it but after trying the paid version and using the record function I have an even greater love for this app. Very worth it!
B007D2XSW0|4.0|I got this Bc it was free, only to discover I don't even have a camera... but I have this app on another device, and its awesome
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|I must admit, I was a bit skeptical at first but this thing works wonderfully. Another purchase that I'm truly happy about, truly a wonderful app.
B003Y5H5HY|4.0|this movie had the typical David Fincher look--kind of dark and dreary(hope spelling is right..-oh well). The acting was great, particularly the girl with the dragon tattoo. She wins you over very quickly
0345803485|2.0|I've never written a review before but felt that all the publicity this book has been getting for its over the top sex scenes needed some clarification.  This is the story of a billionaire with S&M fetishes who meets a naive virgin and introduces her into the world of sex, bondage and S&M. The bantering back and forth between the two of them, especially, the email parts, were funny and interesting, but the sex scenes were far from dirty and raunchy and there is somewhat of a storyline, not just sex.  But if I had to read one more time how \\"he cocked his head to the left,\\" or \\"you're biting your lip,\\" I would've set the book on fire!  Way Too repetitive!!  Overall, it's an okay book, will keep you amused, but definitely will not make you horny.  The author keeps you interested with the billionaire's quirky sex antics and keeps you guessing as their future relationship up until the end, but then does a total 360 and the ending leaves you saying \\"Huh? Are you kidding me????\\"
B0086700CM|4.0|I had 9,800 coins then all of a sudden I had 1,000 coins I'm so mad at this game but I still like it
B007D2XSW0|5.0|only on this app can you put a salor hat on a gold fish that you turned purple. I love it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I found this game to be awesome! it keeps me enteriaaned for hours I could okay it all day ling if I had the time its always a challenge to get more game though
B007N8RULO|5.0|Well I guess you would love it if you are a solitaire fan haha but sometimes it can get too easy! other than that I love this app because I love solitaire!!!
0140557741|4.0|I read this when I was student teaching with 2nd graders they loved it so I thought I would do this with my 6th graders they didn't really enjoy it as much.  They made fun of it a bit since there was no words.  If you have a mature artistic group of kids they will enjoy no matter the age though.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|I am a self-confessed fan of Science fiction novels and I can attest that Redshirts is one of the science fiction's finest. A classic in its own right, the story is a fantastic balance of comedy, wit, depth and emotional appeal without going out of the science fiction context. I find the plot slightly philosophical and a bit sarcastic which add to the book's overall charm.
B0086700CM|5.0|Always been a fun app but it took forever to get it for kindle fire. But now that's its on the kindle fire its THE BOOM! !!!!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very pleased with Bible App.Also the audio gives the option of hearing the word of God whiledoing other task.Once again highly recmmended.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|&lt;3333333333333333333<br />I love this game its awesome<br />its super cool it has so many different fun games the games keep me entertained for hours
B005KELQEU|2.0|I have a kindle. A kindle that just used to be called \\"a kindle\\". I guess now its name is \\"keyboard kindle\\". It is the latest generation of kindles (3rd). When I saw this for sale, I wondered how it would fit both my kindle and kindle touch having in mind they are different, but then my worries disappeared when I saw the measurements listed in the description: 8 by 5.6. So I got it, turned out it was 5 by 7. Now I have to return. Not really happy about this. The description should be changed and it should be indicated that it does not fit all new kindle generations. Mine is the newest one of its type. Write in big bold letters: DOES NOT FIT KINDLE WITH A KEYBOARD, and you should be fine from now on. Other than that the case itself seems of good quality. But not usable for me.
B0086700CM|3.0|whn u first start playing gits fun but thn whn u play over and over again it gets old:( but its not a bad thing!!!!!!!
B000TGJ8CQ|5.0|It is NOT a fast movie, meaning that action is not all the time, there is space for a bit of story telling scenes and dialog...some suspence but not a complete edge sitting action movie. That doesn't mean is bad, just clarifying what is all about.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|Item shipped in two days as promised...<br />easily detachable FAN from cooling fins...<br />This unit sits 6.5 inches above the motherboad when installed...so make sure your case is wide enough.<br />I suggest you install your own ulta thin insulated washers in the theaded studs that mount to the underside plate.<br />The reason being is your motherboard may have \\"traces\\" that run by or under the fan mount studs... MY ASROCK Z77 Extreme 4 did, and since<br />there is always some vibration from the fan or other components (as little as it may be) I didn't want to take the chance of having metal studs directly touching and then wearing down the coating over the traces on the MB and then shorting something out.<br />The protective film on the new studs was very thin and I turned a stud in one direction too far and the protective film came loose & off the stud.<br />So I replaced that with isulated washers for motherboards on all four studs. Just one on each will do...<br />For the price (19.99) this was a great fan and heatsink. Just some oversights on engineering it in my opinion. Nothing I don't deal with daily anyway.<br /><br />If you are thinking of buying this unit to replace your existing fan and heatsink...you may have to completely remove the motherboard first to install this unit.<br />My new MSI case needed some reworking on the plate the motherboard mounts to to access two of the studs from the backside so that i could attach and secure the nuts to the studs and backplate for the heatsink.<br /><br />Some older CPU cases do not have the backplace access hole to mount the heatsink without removing the motherboard first...so take a peek fisrt to see...otherwise expect to dismatle and re-install.
B001ILHY1I|5.0|Exelent movie if you like none stop action, graphic scenes, fights, explotions and big guns. Better when watched loud with 5.1 speaker!! Is a different theme movie compare with the original one with Silvester Stalone, I believe that is better.
B000BYA5G4|5.0|Shows the viewer how things really happen in the world below the surface of civility. I think this story reflects Victor Bouts story to some degree. The brother is the typical liberal save the world type that gets his axx blown down quick as would happen in real life. The ending will blow you away as the hot shot INTERPOL agent learns that his target is working for the Global Pirates and the dumb INTERPOL agent starts to realize he is only pursuing a fake cause as HIS BOSSES are using Cage to do the dirty work of arms trafficking. You could make a similar movie about sex slavery.  Nick Cage is exceptional.
B006ZZCLV0|5.0|I first saw the movie but as an avid reader I was rewarded by much more when I read these three books.  The adventure and the character development held my attention every minute.  I was so involved that I read the whole trilogy in about 8 days - mind you I worked and slept and ate  too! Treat yourself and read these gems.

B004LKRR6U|3.0|While I agree that the doll is lovely and catches the essence of Grace, the dress is very disappointing (at least on the doll I received).  The pictured costume is flowing and soft. The dress on the doll I received was neither of these things. The material was cheap and lies flat with no volume at all. The hem of the outfit is poorly cut and has none of the flow in the picture.Compared to the Elizabeth Taylor and Audrey Hepburn dolls this doll is shabby. The quality of the costume undercuts the beauty of the doll. While the price is reasonable, I expected more from the brand and find the pictured item clearly false advertising.

0345803485|1.0|I read at least two books a month and a variety of types.  This book was stupid from the first page until the end.  I kept reading in hopes that it would get better and live up to the positive reviews on here but it didn't.  It's basically a trashy romance novel without the romance.  I have a very open mind but still felt that every scene was dumb and not as \\"sexy\\" as some<br />other people thought.  I have at least 15 friends who read the book as well and had the same feeling about it.  If you're looking for more<br />than a descriptive sex scene that lasts 2 minutes in a book series then don't bother buying this.  Maybe if none of us ever read books and get excited for modern day sex novels, I'd have enjoyed it.  But it doesn't take tallent to write about sex.  After reading this book I can bet you will feel unintelligent for even wasting your time.  It's a complete waste of money and nothing to rave about.
B00687XO1G|5.0|Recently I swallowed hard and paid Criterion's price for a Blu-ray disc of \\"Anatomy of a Murder\\" (1959) which has long been one of my favorite films.  I think I've watched it 20 or 30 times since I saw it in a theater in 1959.  Reminds me of one of George S. Kaufman's barbs: \\"What's the matter? Didn't you get it the first time?\\"  At any rate, the Blu-ray is terrific and we see it the way it was originally photographed and not the damned 4 x 3 screen with which Columbia/TriStar butchered the DVD release.<br /><br />It's among my favorite courtroom dramas along with \\"Inherit the Wind\\" and \\"Judgment at Nurmenberg.\\"<br /><br />The choice of Duke Ellington and his Orchestra for a music score was interesting.  Big bands were in decline since the end of World War II as many of the musicians of the day had been drafted and the rise of television did the rest. People at one time liked to go out at night and dance or go to the movies and now they were sitting at home watching their new TVs.  Ellington and Count Basie were the last two black bands still in the business but by the early 50s Ellington was ready to pull the plug.  The era of his greatest popularity had been the 30s and 40s.  Then something unexpected happened.  George Wein who was managing the Newport Jazz Festival booked Ellington's band for one night at the 1956 festival.  The evening went well -- they were graciously received but nothing special.  Then during a break Ellington decided to play two pieces he had written in the 1930s:  \\"Diminuendo in Blue\\" followed by \\"Crescendo in Blue,\\" connected by a saxophone solo by tenor saxophonist Paul Gonsalves.  The first part was played and Gonssalves started his rocking, blues-based solo.  After six or seven choruses, Ellington sensed a reaction coming from the audience so he signalled Gonsalves to continue playing.  The crowd became more and more excited.  By the time Gonsalves had blown 27 choruses, the audience was on the verge of a riot.  People were standing on the chairs and dancing in the aisles.  When the piece ended, Elllington began to fear an actual riot and  wanted to end the set.  George Wein told Ellington to play a couple of slow numbers to calm the audience down.  George Avakian of Columbia records was there and immediately put Ellington under contract and released an (edited) album of the concert.  It became a best-selling LP, unheard of for jazz.  Ellington's picture appeared on the cover of Time and he changed his mind about terminating his orchestra.  Most of his musicians had been with him through the 30s and 40s and when he composed a new piece he did so with a specific musician in mind, something no other band leader had ever done.<br /><br />How can you reconcile the music of a black jazz band with a story of a murder trial in upper Michigan?  You really can't except that Otto Preminger, an immigrant from Vienna, thought of jazz as THE American music, something most Americans did not, being largely unhip.<br /><br />There are moments in the film when Ellington's music seems to be at odds with the subject, but in the scene in which Stewart and Remick are talking outside of her trailer and he, as her attorney,  is warning her that her public behavior could well cause a negative outcome in her husband's trial, a soft bluesy theme with dense harmonies is heard and it is absolutely perfect.  We sense in his admonishment of Remick's behavior that he, himself, is drawn to her and it is all said with that musical interlude.<br /><br />The rendering of this great film on Blu-ray is ideal both in video and sound.  The spoken track is vividly recorded and very clear and Preminger used both very close and very distant microphoning to get different effects.  The music track, unlike the way jazz is usually recorded -- rather up-front and brilliant -- here is slightly soft in the treble, but not muffled, giving it an intimate quality ideal for this occasion.  Unfortunately there is no commentary track, but the extras are very fine and informative.

I had to be removing 3 ugly and unnecessary stickers and no matter how careful I was some traces and marks remained on the covers.

B001P9EQH8|4.0|The Fiio E5 is not meant to be an audiophile grade amplifier, rather a cheap solution for those looking for a little more power. I use my Fiio with my set of 250 ohm Beyerdynamic DT770 headphones when using a portable media player, as most do not provide the power needed to drive my headphones. The E5 does increase the power so that I can listen at a satisfactory level, and I was surprised to find that there was not much sacrifice in terms of sound quality. The bass boost feature, which I expected to be more of a marketing ploy rather than a useful tool, turned out to add a significant amount of bass and warmth. The reason why the device loses a star is because at loud volumes, it does detract from sound quality slightly. That being said, I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a cheap amplifier for high impedance headphones. For those looking for a better product in a higher price range, I would recommend looking at NuForce's UDACs.

0618001905|5.0|This book tells the shameful tale of Belgian colonization of the Congo, and the horror that resulted in the subsequent drive to extract wealth -- first ivory, then rubber, from that country. Despite the efforts of King Leopold of Belgium to whitewash events, they were discovered at the time, and public pressure did lead to changes in the early 20th century. However, in the aftermath of WWI perhaps, these crimes were forgotten.<br /><br />I think Hochschild set two goals for himself in writing this book, first to remind the world that this happened. In this he was totally successful. He manages to find ample evidence of the crimes that happened, and the commercial success of the book added this episode to the roster of crimes between nations. The chapter discussing Joseph Conrad is particularly interesting, showing that many of the nightmarish elements in [[ASIN:0486264645 Heart of Darkness]] were not metaphorical, but were rather straightforward descriptions of what was transpiring in the Congo at the time. The descriptions of the Americans and Europeans who came to realize what was happening in the Congo, and how they brought it to the attention of the world, reminds all of us of our potential to defeat great injustices against difficult odds.<br /><br />Hochsild also tries to pin the abuses in the Congo on King Leopold of Belgium, who thirsted for colonies and wealth. In this, he is less successful. Hochschild demonstrates that Leopold set the conquest in motion, and made demands that were ultimately met by agents who acted brutally, and then tried to hide evidence that this was happening as others came to report what they had seen. However, Hochschild paints Leopold as a Hitler-like murderer, and this is never convincing. It seems more likely that Leopold set a process in motion that had implications he hadn't anticipated, and that he made the brutal decision then not to reverse. Hochschild shows us Leopold trying to keep critics out of Congo, and trying to burnish the reputations of his agents there, but when he died, things didn't magically get better.<br /><br />I disliked Hochschild's definition of the human cost of Belgian occupation, which included \\"babies not born due to oppressive colonial conditions.\\" First, it seems like a lot of guesswork, and second, if you are going to criticize Belgium for the babies who weren't born because of their brutality, shouldn't you also give them credit for the babies that later *were* born, due to the transportation and communications infrastructure and medical technology, and cheap manufactured goods that they directly or indirectly made available? The population of Congo today is far greater than it could have been before the arrival of Europeans. Does this mean that King Leopold is actually a great humanitarian?sh the reputations of his agents there, but when he died, things didn't magically get better.<br /><br />I disliked Hochschild's definition of the human cost of Belgian occupation, which included \\"babies not born due to oppressive colonial conditions.\\" First, it seems like a lot of guesswork, and second, if you are going to criticize Belgium for the babies who weren't born because of their brutality, shouldn't you also give them credit for the babies that later *were* born, due to the transportation and communications infrastructure and medical technology, and cheap manufactured goods that they directly or indirectly made available?

B002KEDQJQ|5.0|This is not the standard superhero film.  There is no hero.  There is no villain.  The bad guys used to be the good guys.  The good guys used to be bad guys.  There is lots of action and lots of battles.  But evil is not defeated and good does not triumph.  In the end, there is, however, world peace.  But how we get from beginning to end is one long, twisting, and confusing narrative.  Someone is murdering a bunch of retired superheroes.  That's so he can keep secret his plan to nuke Manhattan and kill 15 million people for the greater good.  He wants to frame one of the superheroes.  That way, the Russian and American hawks threatening World War III will have a common enemy and become friends.  And when Manhattan is vaporized, everyone will also feel bad.  So, by killing millions of people, he is actually saving the world.  It works.  And we live happily ever after.  You probably think that I didn't like this movie.  But no, this is an excellent film.  It is one of those films you can't help but love.  Not because of the story that is told, obviously, but because of how it's told.  That's why I watch it again and again.  It's an experience.  And I just wish I could experience it again for the first time.
0345803485|5.0|Bought this for my wife because she was talking about it daily.  She blasted through it in 3 days.  Passed it to several women in my office and had to listen to the chatter.  Blushed more than once in the conversation, but was able to provide definitions for things that they didn't understand.  Supposedly a really steamy book but the story is riveting.
B0088RQ4X4|2.0|The film was bad. I felt like the makers of Flesh Gordon where given 200million and let loose. It seemed like the graphics where cartoonish with jerky movements to make the bad drawing worse.<br />Normally I like alot of sci-fi (see fifth element).<br />But not this dog.
0307951529|1.0|Very disappointed, hated the read.  The book's own description is that it chooses \\"to focus on the 50 most intriguing case studies\\" and that the author is \\"not content to speak in generalities.\\"  However, I found both of these facts to be very misguided.<br /><br />Because the book was sourced from hundreds of interviews and described itself as focusing on the case studies of these businesses, I expected a very detailed analysis of the 50 businesses Chris chose.  After all, a case study is defined as a detailed breakdown of a particular matter over time.  Since many reviewers stated that they found the book to be very detailed, I was shocked to find that the 50 businesses were described in very cursory detail without an analysis of each individual strategy used to develop the product/service, market it, and monetize it. Rather than 90% of the book being detailed analysis of each business and 10% the principles that Chris takes away, the book was 90% Chris's principles and 10% vague details of each business.<br /><br />Instead of wasting your money, you can get the same level of detail by reading the post Chris wrote for Tim Ferriss's 4-Hour Workweek blog.  If you feel obligated to get a book, buy 4-Hour Workweek instead.  Many of the concepts from this book rip off what was already said in Tim's book anyways.

B007VTVGAQ|5.0|I'm rather ashamed to admit that, though I've always respected her obvious musical talent from afar, I'd somehow managed to escape Fiona's charms all these years...until the other night, when I couldn't resist any longer. After being intrigued enough by the samples I'd heard here and on her Myspace page, I purchased 'The Idler Wheel...' that same night, and proceeded to listen to it three times straight through. The first time, I was bewildered by what I was hearing, as it was difficult for me to connect with, in the same way it's difficult for me to connect with the avant-garde jazz of John Coltrane or Thelonious Monk, even though I could definitely appreciate the artistry involved in the music's construction. The second time it all made a little more sense, but I still wasn't totally feeling it. Toward the end of my third listen, however, I realized my cheeks were starting to hurt. I'd been smiling from ear to ear for about a good 30-minutes straight.<br /><br />This is an album that works so perfectly as a whole work of art, it's hard for me to cite specific highlights. Most of the songs are dependent on the ebbs and flows of what came before to have its maximum effect, so I definitely recommend listening to this album straight through a few times, or at least in large chunks, before deciding this \\"isn't your thing\\" (like some fans are saying). As a fan of more guitar-driven rock, it's not really my thing either, or so I thought. Then I just put my headphones on, let go of all my preconceived notions of what it \\"should\\" sound like, and let Fiona bring me into her world, a world that, to me, is almost like some weird, parallel-dimension 1940s in which she is the Billie Holiday of that reality, only one who plays a mean piano; with odd time-signatures, curlicue melodies, household object-based percussion, and insanely varied vocals and lyrics that make you feel her wide spectrum of emotions, even if you don't quite fully understand them.<br /><br />Fiona can go from singing about love, to anger, to sorrow, to despair, to paranoia, to neon zebras within the span of a couple songs, and the result is intoxicating, if you just give in to it and let her take you there. Her voice ranges from angelic to maniacal, and everything in between, sometimes all within the same song, leaving me feeling almost exhausted at times. But by the time I get to the excellent, kaleidoscopic (and insane) \\"Hot Knife,\\" which closes the album, I'm usually ready to take another ride. The production on the album is very sparse, with rarely more than piano and percussion framing Fiona's voice, but that only helps magnify the range and authenticity of emotion coming out of her, and the result is as close to perfection as I'm likely to hear this year, or any year.<br /><br />'The Idler Wheel...' is not always an easy, fun ride, but I can almost guarantee that, if you let it, it will be a fulfilling one. There's no higher compliment I can give than that. It's not impenetrable. Some works of art are just deeper and take longer to sink in, and those are the ones that tend to stick with you longer and affect you more profoundly. This album will one day be considered a masterpiece, I'm sure, but I'm just thankful to have finally discovered her beautiful work, even if I am about a decade and a half late. Hopefully she doesn't take another seven years to resurface next time, though thankfully I'll have a few new-to-me old albums of hers to tide me over in the meantime. And I'm sure that, if her next album is anywhere near as brilliant and inspiring as this one, the wait will definitely have been worth it.
B0052VUNHC|1.0|Okay, so after reading numerous reviews I thought \\" surely this will be a good read\\" wrong! It's like the author jumps into a story about a goody two shoes who falls for the stereotypical bad boy. Mind you they are freshmen in college. There is almost too much tension between them, and the need they have for each other is sickening. I was very disappointed because the story and their relationship never picked up. The book just dragged along! Don't bothe reading this if you're looking for a book with excitement and quality.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|Veteran prog-rockers Rush (Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson, Neil Peart) follow-up 2007's [[ASIN:B000NVIXFK Snakes & Arrows]] with their ambitious concept effort, 2012's highly anticipated [[ASIN:B007I2BZIE Clockwork Angels]].  Clockwork Angels has a weighty `concept' and storyline, but despite it's heady ambitions, Clockwork Angels easily delivers one of the year's strongest efforts.  This effort joins Van Halen and Jack White to deliver an intriguing rock effort in a time where rock itself seems `down.' Memorable, cerebral, and consistent, Clockwork Angels is superb.  Lee (vocals and bass) and Lifeson (guitars and keyboards) handle the musical composition while Peart (drums, percussion) handles the lyrics.<br /><br />\\"Caravan\\" opens the effort spirited, opening with bell sound effects and then introducing a rhythmic groove.  Lifeson's guitar have a superb timbre about them and are well mixed within the production.  Ever restless, \\"Caravan\\" features changes of pace instrumentally following the verse with different key, mood and tone; very creative.  Harmonically, the progression employed on the bridge section is superb.  The refrain adds to the programmatic conception: \\"...The caravan thunders onward/to the distant dream of the city/the caravan carries me onward/on my way at last/on my way at last...I can't stop thinking big...\\" The array of instrumental sounds plays as vital a role as the lyrics and Geddy Lee's vocals to \\"Caravan's\\" success.<br /><br />\\"BU2B,\\" released a couple of years ago, continues the mysterious, ambitious and complex nature of Clockwork Angels. Opening with ominous synthetic keyboard effects, soon Lifeson's acoustic guitar enters in.  Geddy Lee's vocals begin muted in effects, eventually repeated to their full glory: \\"I was brought up to believe/the universe has a plan/we are only human/it's not ours to understand.\\" Incorporating the Watchman, a figure within the narrative with the storyline, the heat further picks up within the effort.  The title track is a tour de force by all means, incorporating the use of various styles and sound effects.  Of the most interesting shifts, the incorporation of a blues, driven by Lifeson's acoustic guitar virtuosity, is sheer brilliance.  Peart's drumming facility and lyrics are as clever and vital as ever, particularly as Lee deliver's the refrain: \\"Clockwork angels, spread their arms and sing/synchronized and graceful, they move like living things/Goddesses of light, of Sea and Sky and Land/Clockwork Angels, the people raise their hands as if to fly...\\" The lyrics reference spiritual and the scientific, also exploring and conveying Peart's atheistic beliefs.<br /><br />\\"The Anarchist\\" continues to allure, opening with pummeling drums and dirty sounding guitars.  Lee's bass is noticeably present within the mix, which is yet another pro of the album as a whole.  Continuing to help their audience understand the crux of the narrative, programmatic notes are included within the jacket: \\"Walking among the people - who are so content, so blind - The Anarchist hears the pedlar's call and sneers derisively. \\"What do I lack?\\" Ah vengeance.\\" Definitely deep.  \\"Carnies\\" doesn't miss a beat, incorporating carnival sounds at the onset to contribute to the `tone poetic' nature.  Again, the lyrics in tandem with the overall production are the selling point.<br />\\"Halo Effect\\" is a more sensitive turn from the band, though a smart and successful contrast.  The program signifies love/relationships within this cut, and the use of strings and tamer sound confirms this.  Lee's lead vocals are clear as a bell.  Even the title references back to `angels' and further serves as a nuance of the tightly-sewn nature of the program.  \\"Seven Cities of Gold\\" gives the title track a `run' for it's money delivering perhaps the album's valedictory moment.  Overt from the onset, driven by Lee's bass and the employment of angular, muscular riffs, \\"Seven Cities of Gold\\" is nothing short of superb.  The bite andthe sheer resolve of the cut remind and reminisce back to [[ASIN:B000001ESF 2112]]'s \\"Passage to Bangkok.\\" Again, is it coincidence that the `seven,' a biblical and oft-cited religious number is central here?<br /><br />\\"The Wreckers\\" finds more play into Peart's atheistic agenda, with references to salvation, even if they be `indirect.' Within the program, the notes read: \\"...We seemed to find salvation in an unexpected signal light.  Steering toward it, we soon learned it was false...\\" Read into it as you may, it is no secret that Peart's lyrics have always been sharper and laden with messages deeper than what appears. \\"The Wreckers\\" shines brightly, even after following a juggernaut the likes of \\"Seven Cities of Gold.\\"<br /><br />\\"Headlong Flight\\" delivers superbly, joining top echelon cuts like \\"Clockwork Angels\\" and \\"Seven Cities of Gold.\\" Opening with a minimalistic groove and a driving, uptempo nature, \\"Headlong Flight\\" is Rush at its best. Angular, slick, virtuosic musicianship, \\"Headlong Flight\\" is CLASSIC.  \\"BU2B2\\" again focuses on more `realist' ambitions, as evidenced by it's program: \\"...No more boundless optimism, no more faith in greater powers, too much pain, too much grief, and too much disillusion.\\" Albeit brief, \\"BU2B2\\" is as much part of the totality of the project as anything else.<br /><br />\\"Wish Them Well\\" incorporates asymmetric meter brilliantly and Lee's `lungs' sound as impassioned as ever.  As good or possibly better is the culminating closer \\"The Garden,\\" which closes the epic, well epically.  Standing strongly upon the program the liner state: \\"I have now arrived at that point in my own story. There is a metaphorical garden in the acts and altitudes of a person's life, and the treasures of that garden are love and respect.\\"  Another spiritual reference, nonetheless.<br /><br />What else can be said?

0099579936|2.0|I won't write a long, wordy review, since many have echoed my dislikes in the book.<br /><br />It felt like James used a thesaurus like a bible in this novel. How could she make Grey seem smarter, sexier, more attractive... Oh I know! With exotic, large words! Not to remind anyone the Steele is an English student who would more than likely be unphased by this in him. The characters in this book are so... transparent and dull.<br /><br />I think the character of Kate is a toss away. I think her mother talks like she is from the 50's, not the free spirit Steele claims she is. I think this novel lacks imagination at every twist and turn. The only place the writing is truly human is in the emails they send to one another. I feel the whole story would have been better had it been told this way... But one can't have a \\"Red Room of Pain\\" that way, can they?<br /><br />I do, however, refuse to hate something before I read it and understand why. I'm not surprised that I hated the anti-femism in Twilight, the controlling nature of the male lead, and the weak, goes-with-whatever-her-lover-wants personality of the female lead. That being said, this novel is exactly the same. I was only glad at the end when Steele stood up for herself to Grey... only to start the second novel and be disappointed by her spinelessness.<br /><br />The writing is weak and amateur. I have seen better writing in youth workshops... But this is simply my opinion. I will finish the series, since I don't do anything half-way. I pained through Twilight. I can pain through this.
B007D2XSW0|2.0|Won't load pictures on my EVO. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling but that didn't fix it. glad I didn't pay $5 to find that out.
B006G2NVCA|1.0|What a horrible, horrible CD set!  I enjoyed Mr. Reznor's award-winning soundtrack for \\"The Social Network\\", and when I saw the movie, I KNEW I wanted the soundtrack. I didn't realize it was Trent Reznor doing THIS soundtrack, so I was doubly excited when I ordered this.  I am suffering through the 3rd disk as I write this, having given up hope that there might be something I could enjoy from it.  I was VERY pleased to hear \\"The Immigrant Song\\" lead off the first disk, and it was a long....LOOOONNGG....SLOOOOW death spiral after that.  I will have a lot of trouble putting this on to play again...
B00881VLCE|4.0|needs more images, but it is a boredom buster,I love to do these whole watching Tv.different settings are helpful<br />pefert settings for the kindle. two thumbs up and 4 stars
B007IXWL2C|5.0|WOW! This was THE best one out of all of them! Absolutely loved it! I especially loved how she wrote the Epilogue through Chrisitan's view on how him and Ana met; would love to re-read the entire trilogy through his eyes =). I am a huge fan of Twilight, and know that she got Chritian and Ana from Bella and Edward and a lot of Twifans are not happy about it, but I absolutely love it! It actually takes it to a more physical level with this love story and I think it's great! Plus, Twilight was more for teenagers and of course paranormal, but Fifty Shades of Grey is more for adults and not paranormal, so it makes it even sexier since everything in it could happen in real-life ;). Twilight was my favorite series out of all the books I have read, but now Fifty Shades of Grey goes head-to-head with it, and I don't know who I like more, Edward or Chrisitan...very hard choice lol, but probably Christian since he has more of a bad attitude =). Anyways lol, anyone who wants to buy these books should definately do it without hesitation! Great book, well written...Good job, E.L. James!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|its so cool because u can do so much! i love it and it makes pictures look very different and cool!!
0345803485|5.0|I was a little hesitant about reading this book just because I read all these negative reviews about it, but my friends kept enticing me with the erotic details of the book and said that they have read and re-read this triology over and over and just absolutely adored it. So, I decided what the hell? I'll give it a shot and so glad I did. Yes, it was repetitive and not the best well-written book, but the storyline was great! I could not put the book down! It took me only a week to read the entire trilogy and now depressed that I have no more to read =/. Of course this book is probably not going to be taught in Universities or any other school for it's grammar, but it does keep you entertained. It had me laughing, brought tears to my eyes, and I fell in love with the characters. If you just want something to take your mind off your reality, and dive into something out of the oridnary, then this is the book to do it. Great job, E.L. James!

0439023491|3.0|This book continues the story of Katniss Everdeen and the hunger games.  In this book a lot of things happen. Without giving away any spoilers, Katniss goes in a Victor tour, 6 months after winning the hunger game, with mate, Peeta Mellark, then it is announced that the 75th hunger games will be celebrated ( with a lot of twists).<br /><br />I didn't liked it, because a lot of things happen, then the ending of the book seemed to drag on, so it bored me a little.  Maybe my expectations were a little higher, because the first book was amazing.  The author was touching so many things, in a very clever way, I loved it! I'm going to read the final book, because I want to know what will happen, hopefully, it will be a better read than this one.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|its a good app.plenty of games to play just takes a long time to unlock all the other games.and that's all from this guy.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Excellent adventure. Lots of weapons, violence and an equal amount of mental gamesmanship. RDJr and JLaw were in great sync in this film. The female characters were sexy and capable.  I enjoyed the action and adventure very much. You can always increase the mystery and reduce the action to variate the formula, but so far this is a winning series and I look forward to the next one. Holmes is a bad motha and I like him that way. A lot.
0061692042|5.0|See the USA in your Chevrolet, but take a Ford to Canada<br /> Richard Ford's Canada (2012) is a marvel of construction, consisting of two loosely related parts punctuated by unexpected violent action (though nothing in the fiction of Richard Ford is entirely \\"unexpected,\\" thanks to his canny foreshadowing: his favorite quotation seems to be from John Ruskin: \\"composition is the arrangement of unequal things\\").  A third \\"part\\" offers an epilogue in hindsight that attempts to complete the story.  Part one tells the story of two twin siblings separated after their parents decide to rob a bank; both of them leave the town of Great Falls before they can be placed in an orphanage; the sister goes to San Francisco and becomes a sort of hippie; the brother is taken by a friend of his mother's to live across the border in Canada.  Part two of the novel is a coming-of-age story involving the boy, Dell Parsons, who unwittingly becomes involved in a murder plot.  But all he wants is to be educated, as he finally is, in the next province to the east, Manitoba.<br /> The boy, Dell, is the narrator (or at least the focal point:  the story is told from his perspective, fifty years after the events recounted, which gives him the perspective to reflect on meanings he could not have understood as a fifteen-year-old, a typical Fordian fictive trick).  Dell knows he is an American, but he learns to think and speak like a Canadian, and the novel forms a wonderful meditration on those differences.  The truly \\"bad\\" characters seem to be American, reacting out of fear and stupidity (Dell's parents, e.g.) or paranoia and selfishness (the mysterious ex-pat who rules the roost at the Leonard Hotel in Fort Royal, Saskatchewan).  The Canadians tend to be less impulsive, more restrained, and even, for the most part, more decent.  But the overview is not so simplistic.  This seemed to me the best Ford vehicle I had encountered since The Sportswriter.  --Jim Welsh, Salisbury U (Maryland)

0205313426|3.0|Given the tenuous reviews of this book, I decided to check it out at a library rather than purchase my own copy.  My professors had pointed me to this book several times to clean up my writing during grad school.  After reading it once through, most of it seeemed quite obvious. I came away with a list of about 5-6 things I hadn't considered. I just jotted them down to keep next to me when I edit my writing.  The information probably could've easily been obtained for free and more easily online.  Finally, I agree with many of the critics that this book frequently breaks its own rules - often breaking the very rule it is attempting to explain while explaining it.  Example:<br /><br />\\"The subject of a sentence and the principal verb should not, as a rule, be separated by a phrase or clause that can be transferred to the beginning.\\" - Strunk and White<br /><br />or......<br /><br />As a rule, the subject of a sentence and the principal verb should not be separated by a phrase or clause that can be transferred to the beginning. - Me =D<br /><br />To be fair, they are right.  The second version does sound better and is easier to read......

B007D2XSW0|3.0|After all the bad reviews I wasn't too sure about this app. But unlike some users I had no problem running it on my Samsung Galaxy S. Also, unlike some complaints, I could save directly to the phone rather than just uploading to Facebook or Twitter, that is what the &quot;save&quot; button with the little arrow is for. Its not pointing at the facebook and twitter icons, it is a save button. The app seems to open pics fine as well. However after playing with my 3rd pic a box popped up asking if I wanted to rate it 5 stars. Kinda tacky devs. So you get 3 stars. Don't know how often I will actually use this program but since it was free and I don't have problems with running out of space I will probably keep it.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I seriously hate more people can't enjoy this app. I have a Droid and its working great for me! I would have given the app 4 stars because so many other people can't use it. But its getting so much flack that's not just.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Story could be so much more compelling (loaded with possibilities and much, much richer substance) if only it had the benefit of a talented, commited editor or co-author. As it is now, it is a royal mess and, sadly, quite offensive to readers who rightly expect a whole lot more. Ms. James is a pathetically lazy writer and had better wake up before she attempts another novel.

B0002KZAKS|5.0|This is a terrific value for anyone who wants something like the Shure SM58 but doesn't want to lay out $100. I bought it myself as a kind of experiment. I'm learning blues harp. I wanted to try out mikes that could be used for a combination of vocals and harmonic playing. For this reason, the mike had to be one that I could cup in my hands but also mount on a stand. While my Astatic JT-30 has the great shape and crunchy sound that harp players love, I can't (easily) mount it on a stand and use it for vocals.<br /><br />The spherical receiver makes the XM8500 pretty easy to cup in my hands. The torpedo body mounts easily on my OnStage boom mike stand. And the low-impedance output feeds nicely into my guitar amps with no need for preamping or impedance-matching (and no resulting noise or signal loss).<br /><br />The mike isn't perfect, but its low cost and generally excellent construction more than make up for the slight deficiencies. Here are a couple of more casual notes:<br /><br />1. The mike in the picture looked bluish to me. What I actually received was a mike with a very nice black finish.<br /><br />2. The product description seems to report a weight of 8.5 ounces. I measured this mike at 10.3 ounces. That gives it a substantial feel although the mike is still a bit lighter than similar dynamic mikes that I've used.<br /><br />3. The mike has 500 ohms impedance and a frequency response up to 16,000 Hz. Bluesmen prefer a cut-off at 10,000 to give a midrange boost, but tweaking can compensate for the extended range on this mike.<br /><br />4. The mike doesn't have an on-off switch, perhaps its  only real deficiency. These switches really are very handy.<br /><br />5. In actual use, the mike dosn't seem very susceptible to pops, and there is no hiss.<br /><br />6. The mike comes with a pretty substantial hard-shell carrying case with a molded foam interior that is more than enough protection. I find a smaller zippered case to be more convenient for pacing this mike in a suitcase, but if you are toting a fair amount of equipment around, or storing this at home, then the oversized case should work well.<br /><br />I hope this helps.mike in a suitcase, but if you are toting a fair amount of equipment around, or storing this at home, then the oversized case should work well.<br /><br />I hope this helps.
B007D2XSW0|3.0|A friend of mine got this as the FAOTD and said it \\"looked\\" awesome. He hadn't really used it yet though. I downloaded it on both my Motorola Xoom and Galaxy S II. It has the same issues on both so I know it's most of the issues are due to either the app itself, or that the app doesn't play well with ICS. I took off a star for each issue that I noticed on both my tablet and phone.<br /><br />1)The very first thing I noticed was that when using the Focal Point tool, you can set the point and preview the changes, but when you apply the focal point edit the focal point jumps up and to the left. I tried applying the focal point to a picture of a face with the focal point over an eye and when I applied the setting the focal point was up on the forehead. I also found another issue with the focal point settings and that is with the color shift. At one point on the slider it goes from color to almost full black and white. There was no gradual change.<br /><br />2)When I saved the picture back to the phone I had no idea where it saved it at. Most photo editors that I've used either creates it's own folder to save pictures from the app (even the stock photo editor does this), or at least let you rename the photo before saving it back to the same directory as the original. This app uses a long random number string as the file name so when I finally found that it was in my camera directory (even though that wasn't where the source was from) I had to scroll through all of my photos before finding it.<br /><br />I'm sure there are some other issues I just haven't found yet, but hopefully the dev will fix the ones that are already there.

0345803485|1.0|This book reads like a 14-year old's \\"Twilight\\" fan fiction. This book is so horribly written, I am honestly at loss for words on what to write on this review. I cannot imagine why it sold that many copies, there are glaring sentence structure errors, poor vocabulary, and even some spelling mistakes despite the extensive proofreading it must have received.<br />All this book is, is an introduction to fan fiction for people who do not know how to use the Internet. I apologize for some coarse language here, but I am just so utterly disgusted with this pile of crap masquerading as a work of art, I am holding back my disappointment with the people who buy this and give the author money that she did not deserve.<br />If you respect books and like a good read once in a while, stay away from this. If you want to read a teenager's fantasy, by all means go ahead and buy this.

B00884GR0W|2.0|Whenever I am playing it keeps logging me out to my home menu and it wont save!! don't waste your money!!!!! its not worth it!!!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|With so many people buying this book,<br /> I hope to dissuade even one more from following the herd.<br /><br />The vocabulary is repetitive and lazy.<br />The characters are flat and unbelieveable.<br /><br />Fellow book lovers, with so many great<br />books available, don't waste a minute of your life on this trash!
B005LAIH2W|4.0|No movie can equal the book it was made from.  Words don't translate easily into film.  The film itself is very good, very well made.  It is not an exact reflection of the first JCoM book, unfortunately, it is something of a mishmash, so 4 stars. The charm of the book is partially in ERB's Victorian attitudes, which reflect fairly accurately how a Civil War soldier would actually have felt.  It is hard to imagine that this book could have been written before my father was born.  I think the movie would have done better had it been a little closer to the book, but that's just my opinion.  It's worth seeing.

B0073PPKNM|5.0|My wife bought me this loveliness this evening, just to be sweet, but this is far from our first swim in that butterscotch rum that is Melody's voice.<br /><br />\\"Absence\\" is an excellent album that has a rather different approach from the hallmark jazz that we've verily enjoyed from her in the past.  Frankly, I was ready to be a bit grumpy:  it's not often that you find a truly great jazz artist in this day and age; especially not one who sings in French!<br /><br />But, despite what I considered perhaps an overabundance of Spanish musical influence throughout, \\"Absence\\" combines so many other polycultural influences as well, it's rather tough to go wrong, and the grumpyface melted pretty quickly into enjoyment of another fine installment in the music joy of a musician we both love.<br /><br />Anyone who hasn't taken a good look and listen to this needs to take a bit and just enjoy. Melody Gardot is a woman who, against the odds of terrible poverty and a hit-and-run that left her for dead and shattered her body, has built herself into a truly versatile and very talented musician, composer and performance artist, full of humor but also humility.<br /><br />She really is rather wonderful, with a true modern jazz mindset that is barely encompassed by the label, and voice that makes people think of Nora Jones, Billy Holiday, and our much-missed Ella Fitzgerald, but which is absolutely, undeniably her own.<br /><br />On a final note, there is a rather remarkable YouTube playlist, which contains her musicumentary: \\"The Accidental Musician,\\" which you should definitely start with, as it shows her growth as an artist and her triumph over hardships that, and will make you love her all the more.<br /><br />Also in the playlist are several other really wonderful live pieces, including her concert \\"Live Jazz &agrave; Juan.\\"  While these do not have pieces from \\"Absence,\\" these live arrangements show the movement toward her current musical influences.<br /><br />In case Amazon dislikes the link, the playlist is:  Melody Gardot<br />by trisabeleza<br />[...]leza  [...]
B007D2XSW0|3.0|This app is an interesting and useful photo editor, but it does have some problems. I find that it isn't really worth the price tag, and that it crashes on my kindle fire when I try to save my creations.

B007MAETA8|5.0|I've liked all of John Mayer's albums except for Battle Studies, so coming off of that, I was unsure about this one, but I decided to give it a shot anyway. When I first listened to samples, I was surprised by the folky sound, but it grew on me quickly. This is solid music, with a lot more nuance than the Battle Studies album.<br /><br />Born and Raised has a much more laid-back, almost quiet sound than past albums, giving the vibe of John and his buddies in a room just making music, but it's not boring, and John definitely takes the folk-colored sound and makes it his own. There's no faking it here.<br /><br />Any album that I want to listen straight through, instead of throwing a couple of songs on my playlist, is a winner for me, and Born and Raised is one of those. If I had to pick a few top songs, I'd say \\"Queen of California\\", which is a great opener; the title track \\"Born and Raised\\" which feels like a follow-up to \\"Stop This Train\\" from the Continuum album--a wistful look at getting older; and \\"Walt Grace's Submarine Test, January 1967\\", which crafts a folk tale of accomplishing the impossible, which would make a great movie, and condenses it into one song.<br /><br />The album has a subtlety to it that makes each listen more enjoyable, so if you're iffy on your first listen, give it another try! My initial reaction on my first listen was \\"It's OK, I'd listen again,\\" probably because it's just quite different from what you'd expect out of John Mayer, but it didn't take long to warm up to it. Continuum is still my favorite John Mayer album, but after a few listens, Born and Raised has achieved a close second.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I've been playing this for a couple of months now and have multiple opponants/gamers which makes it more fun. It has it's pros and cons, of course. Some people can't draw worth a darn and it's a challenge to figure out what they're doing, or the occasional clue that means absolutely nothing because the person really didn't know the meaning of the word they're drawing.  Little things like that really make it a bit more lively though.<br /><br />My main gripe with the game is the game itself being strange. A friend of mine has had her scores wiped clean twice. While I haven't experienced that, I do have \\"Lisa\\" trying to guess the drawing HANDCUFF. She isn't going to be able to do that because the game gave her an enirely different set of letters and not the ones needed to spell that word. Right now she is probably very frustrated with the game and angry with me because she doesn't know what has happened. This is the second time the game has done this to me.<br /><br />Other than that, enjoy it. Just be aware it isn't perfect and apparently will mess with you now and then just because it can.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|loved this app for ever...last couple of weeks though,it's causing random clicks and system freezes. please fix it. I have begun to depend on it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|definitely keeps you engaged. as the village continues to grow so does your ability and drive to fill it. recommend.
B003EYVXYG|1.0|I came in wanting to like this; I thought \\"surely Romero was aware that his last experiment was a failure & will go back to his classic ways,\\" after all, if your style was never broken, you don't need to fix it.<br /><br />The movie starts off with some hammy acting, cheesy dialogue, a thoroughly unbelievable zombie, & bad CG, which had me thinking \\"surely this is a farce, a movie within a movie. In a few minutes, it will pull away, revealing it's on TV or in a theater,\\" but no, it turns out to be a group of people who were in Diary of the Dead for all of 5 minutes. This wasn't starting off well.<br /><br />Right off the bat there are far too many characters & none of them are given any deep character development, so you just don't care about their survival. The main character is an unlikable douche with some of the hammiest acting; You'll probably find yourself thinking that the payoff for the movie will be the moment he dies.<br /><br />There are a few improvements from the last film; Romero thankfully did away with the narration, Found Footage set-up, & shaky-cam effect. Unfortunately I was unable to get more than halfway through the film.
B002ZG99IG|1.0|Okay I knew this was gonna be Single White Female before I watched it. But I decided to give it a try just to see if anything was different. NOTHING was different. This was Single White Female all over except with worse actors and a college setting.<br /><br />Here once again we have a horrid remake AKA copy cat film with a bunch of no-name pinup dolls. It might pattern itself after Single White Female but no way does it reach SWF's caliber.<br /><br />SWF is a classic. It is the queen of all female-on-female obsession films if not the first film of that genre. It is one of the most famous movies in cinema history. In the last twenty years many films have tried to capture the genius of SWF only to fall incredibly short.<br /><br />So why the heck do they keep trying?<br /><br />SWF had the wonderful talents of Jennifer Jason Leigh and Bridget Fonda. I wouldn't have a problem with the no-names in The Roommate if they could act but they couldn't. The wacko girl who is supposed to play Jennifer's character lacks any kind of suspense or terror. She was as scary as a kitten. She did nothing that surprised you, nothing that you cared about, nothing frightening. She was the saddest excuse for a villain ever.<br /><br />Minka Kelly who played the lead role was drab and was about as exciting as clipping toenails. She spoke in her scenes like she was reading out of a book. Her range for this type of role just isn't there. She's an okay actress but to play the Bridget part? No. It just didn't work.<br /><br />The boyfriend was useless and unnecessary. He was a horrible actor. He spent his time grinning the entire film even when the scenes weren't supposed to be funny. Maybe that's because he knew how pathetic this movie was. He didn't do a single thing of importance. Either they needed him for the fight at the end of the movie or so they could have that sex scene. Other than those two things I don't see why they needed him. Sarah did not need a boyfriend.<br /><br />I think this film would've been more interesting if the two women had some kind of lesbian thing going on where either they dated or one just became obsessed. In 2012 you'd think the filmmakers would've been more creative. Even Jennifer Jason Leigh had a lesbian vibe when it came to the SWF role back in '92. We see no reason why the Jennifer Jason Leigh wannabe was so obsessed with Sarah (Kelly). Why? What the heck did Sarah do? She barely spent time with the girl and she wasn't so great that someone would be obsessed with her. The wacko girl was the rich one so if anyone would be obsessed with someone it would be Sarah. It just didn't add up.<br /><br />The film was slow and it was sad that they didn't even try to change anything from SWF except just the setting and age of people. I mean this was so similar to Single White Female that if it weren't for the bad acting, I would've thought that was what I was watching.<br /><br />For those who praise this film, you obviously haven't seen decent films of this genre. Do yourself a favor and go see one. This film couldn't kiss Single White Female's feet. Even if you didn't like SWF, it was better than this mess.<br /><br />If filmmakers are gonna continue to recycle older films for the new generation then they need to at least make them good. If you've seen any decent suspense film then you couldn't find this anything other than mediocre or nerve-cringing horrible.<br /><br />Note to Hollywood: Stop copying hits and stop doing remakes and making them worse!!!<br /><br />Oh and did I mention that Billy Zane is in this? Yeah. Billy Zane. Seriously? That's reason enough not to watch it.is film would've been more interesting if the two women had some kind of lesbian thing going on where either they dated or one just became obsessed.

B0063IH60K|5.0|I have no complaints. I am totally addicted! I love the option to play an opponent. I would pay for it.
B0041T52S6|5.0|And the answer is: Yes!<br />Gameplay: on the surface this appears to be the standard 2D fighter game like Tekken, which you can play either against the computer or player vs. player.  You are Scott Pilgrim, a 20-something bass player.  You must defeat 7 bosses, who are \\"The evil Exes,\\" Ramona's 7 evil ex-boyfriends (well, mostly boyfriends.)  The gameplay is pretty standard- you kill a boss and you get coins and points: 1000 points for the first boss, 2000 for the next, and so on.  In actuality, though, the true mission of the game is to win Ramona's heart, which is harder than you might think.<br /><br />Oh, wait.  It's a movie.  Well, all the above still applies.  In addition, the actors do a great job bringing their quirky characters to life.  (Those of you who have decided you don't like Michael Cera, who plays the title role, still won't like him.  I have no problem with him.)  If there remains within you any trace of the child you once were (and I hope there does), you should enjoy this movie.<br /><br />DVD extras:<br />-27 minutes of deleted scenes<br />-9 and 1/2 minutes of extras<br />-A trivia track you can turn on to play during the movie.<br />-4 commentaries, 2 with the cast, 2 with the crew
B005K17RU0|5.0|this is a fantastic app for my fire.  the other weather app I had was not as interactive or precise for that matter. plus it gives me warnings of severe weather when it happens.  its like having ones own little wea<br />therman in their home.  thanks!
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|very well done game.  exciting with the right amount of challenge.  busy job being both mayor and public works and police chief
0345803493|5.0|This book will keep your interest all the way through. A definate page turner. This series is a must read....not for the faint of heart....Very erotic
B007D2XSW0|4.0|Yes, it make s my pics look cool but more! Some WEBSITES have more! Not too many categorys...Work on it.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I just got this, so I can't say much about durability yet. It does appear to be fairly durable, but I wouldn't test it's durability on young children. It will provide good protection from scratches, but I wouldn't use it if you're prone to dropping expensive things. It is very lightweight. The stand mechanism is easy to use. Over all, I would say that the price fits the product.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|love it! highly recommended for both casual and expert photographers. very easy to use. is no doubt 5 stars for me!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. it is so much fun. I am always trying yo get more coins. yay temple run!
B005K17RU0|3.0|It gives you the correct information on the weather, not allot of bell and whistles however, maybe the paid version is better.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This is the second book in the trilogy.  It is a continuation of the story started in \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\".  Anastasia learns more about \\"Grey\\" and understands why he is the way he is.  Their relationship develops further.  Although there is still explicit sexual activity Grey tries to be more \\"normal\\" to keep Anna by his side.I'm loving reading it on my new Kindle Fire.  Jo
B0040HO16S|5.0|Having finished watching Downton Abbey and missing it dearly, I turned to this series and truly did not think it could be put up against Downton Abbey - - But alas I was wrong and so thankful that I was!! I have just finished watching Season 2, after; of course Season 1, and find that the characters find a way into your soul.  I shall be sad when I have seen them all, but it is most pleasing to know that I can visit with them anytime. I too have watched this on my Kindle Fire with my Amazon Prime membership. It is a joy to know that such quality entertainment still exists!!
B000Q6GUTI|5.0|So you think you know how the government works.  Watch this and it will make you think.  Well acted with a few subplots that must me viewed  several times to get the full picture.  Highly recommended.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|the bug prevents me from loading images in my gallery.  please please fix that soon!  this is a very good editing app.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|only used it for a moment but works alright on SG2, I don't think I would have paid $3 for it.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|For some reason I really liked this book. Wool is about a future, hundreds of years from now where all of humanity lives underground in a bunker of sorts with just a few thousand people due to the surface of the planet being uninhabitable. Even though really very little happened, the author was able to create a sufficient mystery that I had to finish it to see how it played out. It is also an interesting idea about how mankind might survive, even if the planet is dead.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|draw somthing does have little adds but that does not stop it from being fun does it? it is somthing that if you got it you would love do not listen to 1star ratings :-)

B004I9CXHW|5.0|It works as advertised.  Easy to remove the old one already there if you need to and just as easy to install.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|Well, I have to say this game got VERY addicting. The only problem was that I could not find out the last answer. I uninstalled it, and now I hope to find ALL my answers again. Remember this: DON'T DELETE THIS APP IF YOU ARE FRUSTRATED!!!
B005LAIGWS|1.0|This flic fails on so many levels. Embarrassingly over the top performances by most of the actors, pretentiously campy action, strange cadence, low budgey feel. Was an effort to get through. I really hope the dr Strange movie saves the Marvel Knights line. Just imagine a supernatural Avengers'esque team movie including Blade, Dr Strange, Ghost Rider etc..
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is kind of addictive  but the games are very simple. just the variety of games makes you want to keep playing
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I thought this app was really bad  but its awesome and now I don't have to find my lost caculator
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm gonna need spare batteries if I leave this game on my phone. So addicting. definitely worth the download. i love it!
B0086700CM|5.0|I always wanted this game to come out and it did vyvyvh. vvv ughdhv Vichy gghjh ughh ugdgjc ufgdug ih
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|I was happy to receive my CD faster than I expected. It was a Great deal!  Just as described. Thank you!
B0077SGMXM|4.0|the best free game so far.most of the games amazon give away as free app of the day are not even worth downloading.
B00465I17E|5.0|The Great Debaters is a very fine film.<br /><br />It reminds us of what it means to be excellent, to stand for something good, to love with all our hearts, and to shine.<br /><br />The performances, or the cinematography, historical care, or directorship all lift it out of the ordinary.<br /><br />And in its difficult subject: racial tension and the education and discovery of values by the three young debaters from Wiley College, one of the oldest colleges in America, it creates real excitement and interest.<br /><br />But the real reason that this is a fine film lies in is its plea that in education lies the reasoning, the power, and the will to change history. That learning lies not just in knowledge but also in applying that knowledge to better yourself, your world, and all of humanity.<br /><br />The very significant point of the film is at the end. I can forgive the slight drag here and there because the ending is magnificent and explains something crucial about American history by its finish.<br /><br />From an era when bigotry, racism, and degrading behavior was a wretched norm to our era where values are mutable, where dumbing down has no limits, and taste little place; The Great Debaters stands out as being a story that stands against all of these things.<br /><br />The rating says it all: excellent.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|This album was beautifully names as Donna paint masterpieces of soul, rhythm and disco. In a way that only she can. Donna summer was truly the voice in her field. Irreplaceable, she will be missed.
0345803485|4.0|I just finished the book & to be honest & fair, I think its a pretty good book. Not the greatest book but a good book. I'm a 20 something gal & the way that Ana thinks, \\"Oh crap.\\" etc, that whole biting her lip ALL the time & rolling her eyes...well that sounds like me lol! Sue me for not having a wide variety mental effin dictionary lol. But for those to say that the author can't write isn't being fair. Realistically, some women can relate to the everyday things that Ana does. & I read someone's review about a 20 something year old not having an email address? Um, I didn't have a MySpace or a Facebook let alone an email address until a few years ago. I wasn't into that whole cyber thing until recently. So that's something that I can relate to too. In fact, I didn't have an email until I needed one to make me a MySpace. (just saying)<br />Now about the whole dominant & submissive thing, I've heard of it (lightly) but never read a book about it until now & I'll be honest, I'm intrigued. The things that he does to her (minus the spanking with that belt, lol) I seriously would try just because its very erotic. But just like Ana, I'm not the submissive type either. I would probably go head to head with Mr. Grey just like her because well...that's just me. I don't like being told what to do & would do the opposite, in fact, just to piss you off lol.<br />And their whole relationship from the beginning, where she's a virgin & blah. There are some girls out there who has never touched themselves. Unfortunately I'm not one of them, but there are girls out there. Clearly Ana isn't comfortable in her own skin & is quite the awkward virgin. But after she's lost it to him, I can relate to that sexual drive that is fired up & its like a bottomless pit. I'm not sure about that whole coming to his voice or his simple touch. That, I never experienced lol. & if I ever get a chance, I would feel intimidated by him because that is where I would be relinquishing control over my body tohim & that's actually scary when you think about it.<br />Oh & I read somewhere about this being...crap, I don't know the word exactly, but I'm sure it will come to me. About that hitting women thing. Again, in this world of dominant & submissive, S&M, whatever, its between two consenting adults. Either the male or female will take their parts. (maybe to those with this particular issue would rather Ana being the dominant one? lol) Some watch porn to get their kicks, this world is about pain turned into pleasure. I like to be bitten while doing the nasty, I don't mind being held down, etc. its sex. (just saying)In that world, all of that is NORMAL. So those that got their panties in a bunch needs to get a grip because in reality, this world does exist & I'm sure its far worse than what was written, lol. Close the book, give it away, sell it even if you can't handle a woman being dominated sexually. Before your blood pressure sky rockets, remember...its just a book & you weren't FORCED to read it.<br />Anyways, to conclude my overly long review (lol) I find this book good, as I said before, & would read it again. I'm not picky, I can do with the few flaws, & yes there are flaws; billionaire, young, handsome, expert with his HUGE...well, you get it. It sounds too good too be true. But that whole tortured soul, no one is perfect & if the author hadn't made Mr. Grey appear too fantasy like, maybe others would believe it more. But as I was saying, minus the flaws, I actually enjoyed this. In fact, my favorite quote \\"I don't make love, I f**k...hard.\\" Yeah, I'm not one for love making either, lol! :)<br /><br />btw, this book is clearly not for everyone.
B005K17RU0|5.0|really like the favorites list for other cities.  the sat info shows whats coming.  easy to use, just get it.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I love one direction I liv them have you guys seen the picture that saunter took of Harry and Louis on the bed under the cover Makeing out

0307592731|3.0|Emotional story, well-told. For a trail narrative, there are other options - try A Walk in the Woods or a A Blistered Kind of Love
B004KS96GW|1.0|it did not the whole school year....<br />Threads ripped...pockets ripped....just not so good!<br />I am very unhappy!!!<br />I will never buy again!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great game and it is easy to navigate.  It is nice for when you want to play something that does not take too long.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|fun to play. not hard to comprehend.  quick action. you can very easily lose track of time. would recommend fun for all ages young or old.
B0086700CM|2.0|a little disappointing, but the kids have fun but it is a little boring never going farther or advancing to higher levels.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Games were entertaining and fun minus the ads popping up all the time. Lots of different types of games which is great.
B0050DZ8J0|3.0|A good app for smartphones where you only need to view profiles or read messages on a small screen (works great for my DroidX). But for a tablet, 2 key pieces are missing: (1) ability to edit your profile and tag your contacts as on website; (2) zoom in or enlarge text size at least on my Kindle Fire. Fix these and get a star.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Lots of fun, many courses and a wide variety of challenges on each course.  Works well on my Sony tablet, no crashes or issues running program.
B006886AN4|5.0|This series is awesome. The contrast between the war in Europe as depicted in Band of Brothers and the total hell of the war in the Pacific is remarkable. I am a U.S. Marine Corps vet and I endorse this product.

B007U1FEJE|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said already.  This latest project took me by surprise and in a very good way.  From the opening track (clocking in at around 90 seconds) I knew that this 45 minute journey to surf, sun, and my fleeting youth would a special one but what I wasn't prepared for was the emotional connection I would develop with the songs.  This CD is a reflection of a the past and a reminder that life goes by in the blink of an eye.  Songs like \\"Isn't it Time\\", \\"Daybreak Over The Ocean\\" and \\"Beaches In Mind\\" remind me of those summer nights in my youth and thoughts of the girl that was such a part of those memories.  As time drifts people apart and we start to contemplate on life, the closing three songs on this CD are hauntingly beautiful.  They sum up a life that is closer to the end than the beginning and those warm memories of what seems like a lifetime ago are still present and fondly remembered.  If this is The Beach Boys final swan song, then I can't think of a better way to go out than with this CD as a bookmark and a tribute to a brilliant 50 year career. Buy this CD for yourself...and buy one for you Mom and Dad.

0345803507|5.0|This trilogy is fabulous.  I highly recommend all books.  If you read one you have to read all three.  E.L. James is a wonderful writer.  What an imagination.
030758836X|1.0|What a complete and utter waste of time.  The first 1/3 of this novel is \\"teenage girl silly\\".  The last 1/3 is beyond impossible.  I suppose it's a \\"girl book\\" but shame on any critic who alledges this to be a good read for any intelligent person.<br /><br />I read about 200 books a year and my friends tease me about what an easy critic I am.  It is extremely rare for me to be so disgusted.
B002QVZ71I|5.0|A beautiful film, with complex emotions, deep and thoroughly engaging. Every character superbly acted. Not many movies are made like this these days. If you've never seen it, you just must. If you have, watch it again. Forrest Gump is a timeless classic, and will touch your heart.
0765367297|5.0|Eric Nylund has now entered my radar, and I look forward to reading his short story in Halo: Evolutions.<br /><br />I am a die-hard Halo fan, let me come right out and say it. I'm seeking help. If there's one thing that's hard to do, it's to impress me with a book ABOUT Halo. Mission accomplished. Nylund has successfully completed the goals the folks at Bungie and Microsoft had intended for it:<br /><br />1) Halo: The Fall of Reach has CONVINCINGLY and beautifully explored the history of the Master Chief, the shameful origins of the Spartan program, and other topics. But most importantly, Fall of Reach gives a face, name, and past to the heroes of Halo: Combat Evolved, such as Cortana, Captain Keyes, and the Chief. (Sgt. Johnson explored in detail in Halo: Contact Harvest, another great read which I recommend.) It also makes sense of the foggy prologue to the video game, and explains just WHY the Pillar of Autumn has stumbled upon the ring world of Halo. I mean, come on, did you ever REALLY believe that a RANDOMIZED SLIPSPACE JUMP VECTOR would have such interesting results? But enough about that.... you'll have to read it to find out.<br /><br />2) This novel also establishes a VAST universe of Halo lore that EVERY proceeding Halo video game, novel, comic book, and fan-fiction (and who knows? maybe a movie one day) draw upon. Eric Nylund does a fine job of introducing us to an incredible universe of the future, unveiling many worlds, factions, and characters without defining the majority of them, thereby creating a mostly blank canvas (but not too blank) for other artists and fans to paint.<br /><br />Great book all around, excellent, believable authorship and emotionally gripping events.<br /><br />Don't get the second one, though, Halo: The Flood by William Dietz. It really sucks, very mediocre. You're better off playing Halo: Combat Evolved, its basically the same storyline but more enjoyable.

0345803485|1.0|Horrible writing. Every time she says, \\"double crap\\" I want to throw the book across the room. Probably best that I don't because I have the kindle edition.<br /><br />Seriously, did Stephenie Meyer write this garbage? Oh wait! The author is a Twilight fan-fiction writer who is heavily influenced by Meyer. She has taken the characters of Bella and Edward and simply put them in a different setting. Once you see this (and it won't take long) it is an excruciating read.
B0000009NQ|5.0|The Heroes album was recorded in Berlin in 1977, above Low and below Lodger. With Bowie for the Low and Heroes sessions was his trusted producer Tony Visconti; along with Brian Eno, whose ambient music on Another Green World and Discreet Music Bowie admired. It was a time of turmoil for Bowie personally, perhaps his lowest ebb was around the time of the appropriately titled, Low. His marriage with Angie was breaking up, causing so much stress that he believed he was having a heart attack and went to the hospital. He was having trouble with his management, and was accusing everyone around him of only being interested in him for his money.<br /><br />Iggy Pop was also part of Bowie's Berlin entourage, but Bowie was producing him, and that collaboration became The Idiot and Lust for Life. The bass and drums for Iggy's band were played by Hunt and Tony Sales, sons of TV pioneer Soupy Sales. The riff they laid down for Lust for Life was solid gold, and would later be used as the theme music for a cruise line commercial campaign, though sans any trace of Iggy's borderline obscene lyrics. The Sales Brothers would also later form the backbone of Bowie's least commercial outfit, Tin Machine. Bowie and Iggy were no doubt carousing like only they could. Iggy does recall, however, going into Berlin piano lounges and singing jazz standards like The Shadow of Your Smile. For a punk rocker, he always did have a golden baritone voice and would have made one hell of a crooner. In spite of--or perhaps because of--all the turmoil, it was a very productive time resulting in 4 great albums: 2 for Iggy and 2 for Bowie. China Girl from Iggy's The Idiot would later be covered by Bowie and become a hit, providing the Iggster with some much needed royalty checks in his autumn years.<br /><br />Low established a format that was followed by Heroes whereby the first half was somewhat more conventional \\"rock\\" songs with Bowie's vocals, while the second side was mostly instrumental, with Eno's treatments, tape loops, and ambient sounds. The title track of Heroes combined the two approaches, but more about that later. Low did open with the instrumental \\"Speed of Life\\" while Heroes ended with the sung \\"Secret Life of Arabia\\" but for the most part, the two sides were as different as night and day. This was back in the day when records were large, fragile, vinyl disks that had to be physically turned over when one side finished, and the needle had to be carefully placed on the rim, where it slid down a spiral groove, like a skier on a slalom course, or an ice cube on a skillet riding to its own melting.<br /><br />1977 was the year punk rock surfaced, as a reaction to the corporate rock produced by such bands as Fleetwood Mac, Journey, and Peter Frampton. Stadium tours were the order of the day with soaring ticket prices emphasizing the gap between audience and performers. Rock had become a commodity, it was big business, and had lost its edge and any sense of rebellion.<br /><br />With Low and Heroes Bowie was at least doing something not expected of him. For once he hadn't created a mask to hide behind. There were no outlandish characters like Major Tom, Ziggy Stardust, Aladdin Sane, or the Thin White Duke, throwing darts in his lover's eyes. If he was not topping the charts, at least he wasn't embarrassing himself and selling out.<br /><br />The 70s were a decade of fragmentation, and Bowie was an Artist of fragmentation. If his lyrics seemed to be coming out too literal, he would cut them up, using techniques culled from William S. Burroughs and his associate, Brion Gysin. Eno also employed Oblique Strategies, a series of cards he created that would suggest ways of working. Chosen at random, they might say, for instance, play something on an instrument other than your usual one. The I Ching, the Book of Changes, was also utilized. It is my contention that by using these methods Bowie opened himself up to a kind of power of prophecy that manifested itself inseemingly random lyrics that spoke directly to the listener about something personal. Has Bowie been reading my mail? There were other uncanny instances where Bowie would seem to predict future events. He was known to be heavily involved in the occult around this time. The ideas of Carl Jung, who also studied the I Ching, and proposed theories such as synchronicity, would seem to be in effect.<br /><br />Facism was a fear and concern of David, almost an obsession, though I would not go so far as to say that he was a fascist, as some had accused. Bowie thrived in the Berlin milieu, in spite or because of his personal turmoil. Bowie was working on a bio pic of the  painter, Egon Schiele, though it never came to fruition. The proposed title, Wally, probably didn't thrill anyone at the pitch meeting. The Berlin Wall, which had yet to fall at that time but would soon, was an imposing edifice, and a reminder of WW II and The Cold War. Echoes of the stories of Christopher Isherwood, which formed the basis for the musical, Cabaret, could still be heard in the German Beer Halls. All this, and the music of Kraftwerk and NEU! were all examples of the German influence being exerted on Bowie, though he exclaims in \\"Blackout\\" that \\"I'm under Japanese influence.\\"<br /><br />Actually, in the spirit of fragmentation, the music of Heroes combined German, Japanese, Arabian, world music, soul, blues, rock, disco, English music hall, the kitchen sink, and other influences. Let's look at the songs:<br /><br />\\"Beauty And The Beast\\" opens with some synthesizer growls, and then a beat ratchets up, tension builds, you hear a very long groan, and all heck breaks loose with a most unusual cacophonous sound. It is an amalgamation of various styles, but once you hear that voice you know that it has to be David Bowie's latest incarnation.<br /><br />\\"Joe The Lion\\" is next with another beast, this time a lion, but a lion who is just a regular guy named Joe. I wonder if he knows Joe The Plumber? Some speculate that Joe might also refer to Bowie's son, that he and Angie had named Zowie, but called Joe, once they realized what a cruel prank it was to name a boy Zowie. He later changed his name again to Duncan, so as not to be confused with Count Basie's drummer, and became a film director. But I digress... I myself wondered if Joe The Lion might refer to Joe Strummer, who sang a song called \\"1977\\" that had the line: \\"No Elvis, Beatles, or The Rolling Stones.\\" Since Heroes was recorded in Berlin in 1977, Bowie probably hadn't even heard of Strummer, but this could have been another example of Bowie's second sight, his gift for prophecy. After all, \\"after a couple of drinks on the house he was a fortune teller.\\"<br /><br />Joe the lion<br />Went to the bar<br />A couple of drinks on the house an' he said<br />\\"Tell you who you are<br />if you nail me to my car\\"<br /><br />The bit about \\"nail me to my car\\" is definitely a reference to Performance Artist Chris Burden of Venice, California, who had himself nailed to a Volkswagen in 1974. Another line in this song says \\"you get up and sleep\\" implying a reversal of waking and dreaming states. The music continues with the same rocking intensity of \\"Beauty and The Beast\\" but then there is a break that reminds me of the part in \\"Day In The Life\\" where they spliced in the part that McCartney wrote: \\"Woke up. Got out of bed. Dragged a comb across my head.\\" Anyway, it reminded me of that because it was an abrupt change but the two parts went together well, complimenting each other.<br /><br />\\"Heroes\\" the title track, is the 'hit single,' and it also reflects the Berlin setting from whence it came. Bowie even recorded it in German, along with a French version. It was a great ballad that harnessed waves of noise into a pleasing anthem. In his bio of Eno, David Sheppard described the process as \\"three oscillating VCS3 drones\\" from Eno, plus triumphal arcs of guitar [by Robert Fripp] filtered through Eno's extensive treatments . . . to freight the song with its towering opulence.\\" From producer Tony Visconti's autobiography there is this little vignette, where Tony went for a walk with his lover and kissed her by the Berlin Wall, and Bowie later said that he had been looking out the window and saw them. Visconti was very proud to have made such a Hitchcockian cameo in one of Bowie's most significant songs.<br /><br />\\"Sons of The Silent Age\\" is even slower than \\"Heroes.\\" It is almost a dirge, though not without its charms. Though the lyrics are still kind of fragmented, it tells a more cohesive story, though that is not to say that it isn't vastly strange and creates an atmosphere of science fiction. Perhaps a science fiction film from the silent era, like Fritz Lang's Metropolis?<br /><br />Sons of the silent age<br />Stand on platforms<br />blank looks and note books<br />Sit in back rows<br />of city limits<br />Lay in bed coming<br />and going on easy terms<br />Sons of the silent age<br />Pace their rooms<br />like a cell's dimensions<br />Rise for a year or two<br />then make war<br />Search through their one inch thoughts<br />Then decide it couldn't be done<br /><br />They also listen to tracks by Sam Therapy and King Dice, and if you ever need a name for a band, and all of the good ones by William S. Burroughs are already taken, then these two are available.<br /><br />\\"Blackout\\" might be a personal reference to the time earlier in 1977 that Bowie thought he was having a heart attack and was rushed to the hospital, or it could have been about numerous blackouts, things that Bowie did but has no recollection of ever doing. He actually showed up at The Grammys one year to give the award for the best female soul singer, spoke in French decked out in a fabulous tuxedo, gave a flawless presentation, and then had no recollection of being there, even when they showed him a video the next day in his management's office. In Le Freak, an autobiography of Nile Rodgers, who produced Let's Dance, and was no stranger to blackouts of his own, Nile asked Bowie about the Pin Ups sessions and he confessed that he had no memory of those sessions, or vast slabs of his past. The 70s for Bowie was like that saying old hippies had: \\"If you remember the 60s (or the 70s, especially the 70s) you weren't there.\\"<br /><br />Too, too high a price<br />To drink rotting wine from your hands<br />Your fearful hands<br /><br />And so concludes side one of Heroes by David Bowie.<br /><br />\\"V-2 Schneider,\\" the opener of side 2, combines the name of a German missile from WW II with the name of one of the guys from Kraftwerk. It could be an homage to the German inventors or techno, but at the very least, repeating the title over and over as the sole lyric, it gives off more of that German aura that pervades Heroes. There is also a horn section, and the drums give off a martial, marching beat, matched with percussive sound effects and droning sounds like rockets, missiles, V-2s, perhaps?<br /><br />\\"Sense of Doubt\\" is what I feel when I try to remember this song. I would listen to it again, to jar my memory, but it is way past my bedtime. If this song made the least impression, of all the ambient songs, then the next one more than made up for it.<br /><br />\\"Moss Garden\\" is for me the track that made the biggest impression of all of the ambient pieces on side 2. It reminds me of a hot summer day, so hot that you grow drowsy and fall asleep. You have nodded off under a tree. You can see sheets of hot air shimmering like a mirage of an oasis in a dry and barren stretch of parched sand. Maybe that's too dry a simile, because the title is \\"Moss Garden\\" but if that is the case, you are meditating in this zen garden on a summer's day. You hear distant sounds of crop dusters flying overhead. A dog barks, but it is far away, and doesn't disturb your dream. There is the sound of a gong being struck, but the tape is slowed down so much that you can barely recognize it. Bowie plays akoto over this backdrop, and you wonder if this is more of the Japanese Influence mentioned in \\"Blackout.\\"<br /><br />\\"Neuk&ouml;lln\\" is a ponderous and slow piece, with some saxophone parts, played by Bowie, and processed by Eno. As a saxophone player myself, I have to say that Bowie isn't playing that great, but he gets some pretty anguished cries out of his horn, and they are put to good use in the context of this piece. Neuk&ouml;lln is the eighth borough of Berlin, located in the southeastern part of the city. This piece is said by Bowie to be inspired by the Turkish ghetto there, and the despair of the Turks who lived there. The title also seems to be a reference to the German band NEU! formed by Klaus Dinger and Michael Rother after their split from Kraftwerk in the early 1970s. Though they never attained much commercial success NEU! is cited by Peter Doggett as a big influence on this project in his song-by-song analysis of Bowie's music in the 70s, The Man Who Sold the World.<br /><br />\\"The Secret Life of Arabia\\" ends Heroes appropriately with another vocal song detailing Bowie's upcoming middle eastern adventure across the sands of Arabia. As the electronically produced hand claps accent an Arabian beat, I can almost see Peter O'Toole as Lawrence, checking his profile in the reflection of an Arabian scimitar. Not sure exactly what it is about, after all, it is a secret, but Bowie gets credit for being prescient once again, as the Middle East would heat up even more in the years to come. Peter Doggett, in typical Doggett style, complains that Bowie pronounces \\"Arabia\\" with a cockney accent as bad as the one featured by Dick Van Dyke in Marry Poppins but I find it another charming example of Bowie's vocal eccentricity. In fact, I like this song a lot. Of the uptempo \\"rock\\" songs on Heroes, this one is my favorite, and a fitting end to a fine album.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0007229453 Tony Visconti: The Autobiography: Bowie, Bolan and the Brooklyn Boy]] by Tony Visconti<br /><br />[[ASIN:0062024655 The Man Who Sold the World: David Bowie and the 1970s]] by Peter Doggett<br /><br />[[ASIN:0753510022 Strange Fascination: David Bowie: The Definitive Story]] by David Buckley<br /><br />[[ASIN:0393065677 The Red Book]] by C.

Visconti was very proud to have made such a Hitchcockian cameo in one of Bowie's most significant songs.<br /><br />\\"Sons of The Silent Age\\" is even slower than \\"Heroes.\\" It is almost a dirge, though not without its charms. Though the lyrics are still kind of fragmented, it tells a more cohesive story, though that is not to say that it isn't vastly strange and creates an atmosphere of science fiction. Perhaps a science fiction film from the silent era, like Fritz Lang's Metropolis?<br /><br />Sons of the silent age<br />Stand on platforms<br />blank looks and note books<br />Sit in back rows<br />of city limits<br />Lay in bed coming<br />and going on easy terms<br />Sons of the silent age<br />Pace their rooms<br />like a cell's dimensions<br />Rise for a year or two<br />then make war<br />Search through their one inch thoughts<br />Then decide it couldn't be done<br /><br />They also listen to tracks by Sam Therapy and King Dice, and if you ever need a name for a band, and all of the good ones by William S. Burroughs are already taken, then these two are available.<br /><br />\\"Blackout\\" might be a personal reference to the time earlier in 1977 that Bowie thought he was having a heart attack and was rushed to the hospital, or it could have been about numerous blackouts, things that Bowie did but has no recollection of ever doing. He actually showed up at The Grammys one year to give the award for the best female soul singer, spoke in French decked out in a fabulous tuxedo, gave a flawless presentation, and then had no recollection of being there, even when they showed him a video the next day in his management's office. In Le Freak, an autobiography of Nile Rodgers, who produced Let'sDance, and was no stranger to blackouts of his own, Nile asked Bowie about the Pin Ups sessions and he confessed that he had no memory of those sessions, or vast slabs of his past. The 70s for Bowie was like that saying old hippies had: \\"If you remember the 60s (or the 70s, especially the 70s) you weren't there.\\"<br /><br />Too, too high a price<br />To drink rotting wine from your hands<br />Your fearful hands<br /><br />And so concludes side one of Heroes by David Bowie.<br /><br />\\"V-2 Schneider,\\" the opener of side 2, combines the name of a German missile from WW II with the name of one of the guys from Kraftwerk. It could be an homage to the German inventors or techno, but at the very least, repeating the title over and over as the sole lyric, it gives off more of that German aura that pervades Heroes. There is also a horn section, and the drums give off a martial, marching beat, matched with percussive sound effects and droning sounds like rockets, missiles, V-2s, perhaps?<br /><br />\\"Sense of Doubt\\" is what I feel when I try to remember this song. I would listen to it again, to jar my memory, but it is way past my bedtime. If this song made the least impression, of all the ambient songs, then the next one more than made up for it.<br /><br />\\"Moss Garden\\" is for me the track that made the biggest impression of all of the ambient pieces on side 2. It reminds me of a hot summer day, so hot that you grow drowsy and fall asleep. You have nodded off under a tree. You can see sheets of hot air shimmering like a mirage of an oasis in a dry and barren stretch of parched sand. Maybe that's too dry a simile, because the title is \\"Moss Garden\\" but if that is the case, you are meditating in this zen garden on a summer's day. You hear distant sounds of crop dusters flying overhead. A dog barks, but it is far away, and doesn't disturb your dream. There is the sound of a gong being struck, but the tape is slowed down so much that you can barely recognize it. Bowie plays akoto over this backdrop, and you wonder if this is more of the Japanese Influence mentioned in \\"Blackout.\\"<br /><br />\\"Neukölln\\" is a ponderous and slow piece, with some saxophone parts, played by Bowie, and processed by Eno. As a saxophone player myself, I have to say that Bowie isn't playing that great, but he gets some pretty anguished cries out of his horn, and they are put to good use in the context of this piece. Neukölln is the eighth borough of Berlin, located in the southeastern part of the city. This piece is said by Bowie to be inspired by the Turkish ghetto there, and the despair of the Turks who lived there. The title also seems to be a reference to the German band NEU! formed by Klaus Dinger and Michael Rother after their split from Kraftwerk in the early 1970s. Though they never attained much commercial success NEU! is cited by Peter Doggett as a big influence on this project in his song-by-song analysis of Bowie's music in the 70s, The Man Who Sold the World.<br /><br />\\"The Secret Life of Arabia\\" ends Heroes appropriately with another vocal song detailing Bowie's upcoming middle eastern adventure across the sands of Arabia. As the electronically produced hand claps accent an Arabian beat, I can almost see Peter O'Toole as Lawrence, checking his profile in the reflection of an Arabian scimitar. Not sure exactly what it is about, after all, it is a secret, but Bowie gets credit for being prescient once again, as the Middle East would heat up even more in the years to come. Peter Doggett, in typical Doggett style, complains that Bowie pronounces \\"Arabia\\" with a cockney accent as bad as the one featured by Dick Van Dyke in Marry Poppins but I find it another charming example of Bowie's vocal eccentricity. In fact, I like this song a lot. Of the uptempo \\"rock\\" songs on Heroes, this one is my favorite, and a fitting end to a fine album.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0007229453 Tony Visconti: The Autobiography: Bowie, Bolan and the Brooklyn Boy]] by Tony Visconti<br/><br />[[ASIN:0062024655 The Man Who Sold the World: David Bowie and the 1970s]] by Peter Doggett<br /><br />[[ASIN:0753510022 Strange Fascination: David Bowie: The Definitive Story]] by David Buckley<br /><br />[[ASIN:0393065677 The Red Book]] by C.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|Seriously...this is a fun app. If you looking for something to pass the time, you will not be disappointed with this app. Its a bit challenging to get the hang of some of the games, but once you do - you will have fun!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I also own knives by Kabar, Cold Steel, Case, Spyderco, Leatherman, Gerber, and Kershaw. Having recently received the Becker BK2 (Campanion) as a birthday gift, I soon discovered it has a huge following - and deservedly so. It will do all the necessary camp chores and it is indestructible - and relatively cheap. Chop tree limbs for a shelter frame, split kindling, make tinder shavings, slice a pork shoulder, hack a zombie - without breaking the bank.<br /><br />The sheath is friction fit and retains the knife solidly. The retention strap on the nylon portion of the sheath is redundant, and that part of the sheath is flimsy anyway.  You can easily replace it with a Tekloc fastener or scuba web if you prefer the knife to ride lower than your belt - for around $10.<br /><br />I am OCD about sharpness AND I am a terrible knife sharpener, so I bought the Work Sharp sharpener and a bunch of after market belts of varying grit (at micro-surface.com). This allows me to use and abuse the BK2 without worrying about the edge. Nice.<br /><br />As with all hobbies, competing opinions abound, and there is a fair amount of snobbery. Same holds true here. I do think most people will be happy with this purchase. My first impressions were 1) This knife is a brute; and 2) I gotta fix this sheath. I did fix the sheath, and the BK2 has proven to be a brute.

1593272782|4.0|This is a terrific book. The author is a genius coming up with imaginative use of Technics andLego parts to make pieces come alive with motion.<br />But....even though there is a link given in the book for what parts are needed the list is not specific at all. For example I tried to assemble a Technic wheel and attach it to a frame. I could not figure out what the join piece should be. The list doesn't say which one to use and Lego itself gives no clue which pieces turn upon joining and which pieces are static (non-turning). That's kinda important don't you think? The join piece I used would not allow the wheel to turn.<br /><br />If a parts list were available online this book would be a 10!<br />Right now it is a big challenge and I'm not the one supposed to be challenged, the kids are.<br />If anyone can direct me to a User group that has listed specific parts needed for each page PLEASE email or post the address here.<br />I would be eternally grateful. My project has a deadline and I will probably abandon this if I can't get a parts list itime.

B003VANOFY|5.0|I received my G930 headset in less than 2 weeks, which is pretty impressive as they were shipped to Australia. When they arrived I quickly installed the software and set them up, I started Windows Media Player and started listening to some music..<br /><br />I was very disappointed.<br /><br />A quick search on google later for a software update, and 1min download (56mb update) and the difference is amazing, before there were alot of bugs with the EQ and the settings were limited to say the least. After the update, the EQ is very easy to manipulate and there are alot of settings to fiddle with.<br /><br />This headset is very well built, the programmable keys are awesome, and there are plenty for what I want to do with them. Furthermore, after the update there is the option to create multiple profiles and assign them to applications, ie. For Windows Media Player I have left the programmable keys as the default next song, play/pause, previous song. However, for skype I have set the programmable keys to change my voice.<br /><br />The sound is very, very good. The bass responds well and is very clear. The 7.1 surround sound is absolutely amazing, having been a firm believer that you could not get real surround sound without a home entertainment system, I was amazed at this product. The 7.1 surround sound gives me the upper hand in games and I prefer to use it with music aswell. However if you didn't want to use the surround sound for music, then there is a very handy little switch that dynamically switches between 7.1 and stereo.<br /><br />The headset is very comfortable and the ear cups are definitely going to cover your whole ear, the noise cancelling mic does a pretty good job blocking out the noise when you aren't listening to anything, and when you are listening to something, then it is virtually impossible to hear anything background noise. The ear pads are comfortable and help to both block out outside noise and keep the inside noise, inside.<br /><br />Whichbrings me to the battery life, when I got the headset there was 2 hours battery life in them, I plugged them in and started using them - it took two hours, while I was using the headset to fully charge the headset. Once fully charged the headset lasts 10 hours. Furthermore, the wireless is very good. I don't have a small house by any stretch of the imagination, and I was quite comfortably able to venture throughout my entire house and onto my veranda while talking with friends, which passes through 3-4 walls.<br /><br />For approximately $100 AUD these are a bargain in my eyes, with a little tender loving care I can see these headphones lasting me a long time.

B000VSAEYI|5.0|My daughter loves this pool! My 3 nephews have joined us in it twice & we've had 2 other children join us. The only negative is the slide. I haven't been able to inflate it full enough for sliding but the kids still have fun. And I've been able to use all the animals for mini lessons on animals & counting. Worth every penny!
0345803485|4.0|Taking the first amendment into account and the fact that I lived the \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" controversy, if you do not like the book, change the channel. To ban the book is ludicrous.<br /><br />Quick paced, some sensationalism, some gratuitous scenes, not Pulitzer prize writing but over all...great bedtime reading.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I do not understand the popularity of this book. I wanted to put the book down about halfway through. Anyways, I give it 3 stars because I did indeed finish reading it. But I shan't be reading the other 2.

B0023SDPS6|5.0|I don't read westerns, but I have become a fan of the TV show based on this book, and when it came up as a Kindle Daily Deal, I decided to try it. In my opinion, it is as good, in its own way, as the TV show.<br /><br />The main character is an older man, who has lost his wife, and is the sheriff of a county in the western part of the US. He has an interesting group of people working in the office and sharing the duties of discovering who killed one of the men who raped a young, disabled Indian girl several years earlier. They got away with it with just a slap on the wrist because they were still minors. He has interesting neighbors and friends.<br /><br />The writer describes the sometimes beautiful, sometimes brutal landscape this lawman works in very well. It becomes an important part of the world he lives in. You can see the space that surrounds him, and feel the oncoming winter. There is a great deal of snow in the air. There but not quite there yet. I've lived in an area where Fall is like that so it rang true that he was always aware of the weather that was coming on, and the fact that the first real storm of the season was likely just over the next hill, or in the dark cloud on the horizon, while desperately trying to hold onto the last warmth of Summer.<br /><br />One of the things I want in a book is to care about the characters. I care about this man, his friends, neighbors and coworkers. The writer did his job. I will almost certainly buy another book in the series.
B007R9MFPU|3.0|I shouldn't be writing this review. I don't own any Ultravox, but I like their songs. I own all of Midge Ure's solo material. But how am I going to compare \\"Brilliant\\" with Ultravox's previous works? I am at a loss.<br /><br />What I can say is that \\"Brilliant\\" has a handful of good songs, but not enough to rave about it. It's a good album, but let's be honest, the second half of the disc pales in comparison to the first. When you hear \\"Live\\", \\"Flow\\", \\"Brilliant\\", \\"Change\\" and \\"Rise\\"--the first five tracks, you think this is going to be a perfect listen. But it all starts to weaken and fall apart with \\"Remembering\\". In fact, from that song forward, the album takes a downturn musically. \\"Hello\\" doesn't seem to go anywhere. \\"One\\" is maybe the best ballad here, and then it's sludge. \\"Fall\\", \\"Lie\\", \\"Satellite\\" and \\"Contact\\" which end the disc are not memorable.<br /><br />I recommend downloading the first five tracks and keep it at EP length for best results. \\"One\\" could make a nice six song set. The band should have tried just a little bit harder on the music composition front. Ure's vocals are fine, and musicianship is fine, but the band seems to have only had six songs in its bag of tricks here. You are better off listening to OMD's \\"The History Of Modern\\" from 2010.<br /><br />So, three stars for a better than average listening experience.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is the worst 9.99 I have ever spent on a book! It is poorly written porn! I could not even get through it! Any one with  a 21 year old daughter would be appalled that anyone would treat a young woman with such distaste!
B007ZKY7XO|4.0|Scissor Sisters are a conundrum. When they debuted in 2004 they were an odd mix of 70's era Elton John meets modern dance pop sensibilities. They even covered Pink Floyd's \\"Comfortably Numb\\" in an unusual manner. Also, on their first two albums they were reminiscent of 70's era Bee Gees, particularly on 2006's \\"Ta-Dah\\" with \\"Don't Feel Like Dancin'\\". So, all of this led me to wonder if Scissor Sisters had any originality. Were they going to continue as a pastiche, or were they going to go their separate way.<br /><br />Yes and no. 2010's \\"Night Work\\" was an interesting departure into dance music, but they still were unable to escape the fact that they had not broken new ground. And now comes \\"Magic Hour\\". It took me a few listens to get into this album, but once I got into its groove it made sense to me. Again, the band can't seem to find its way to new heights in terms of originality, but they do a fine job of mixing things up.<br /><br />\\"Magic Hour\\" has variety going for it, as well as melodies. \\"Baby Come Home\\", \\"Keep Your Shoes On\\"--these two jump start the album, giving listeners melodies and hooks. \\"Inevitable\\" is a ballad that maybe should have been left off. \\"Only The Horses\\" is one of the best tracks here, and is easily a dance floor anthem not unlike \\"Fire With Fire\\" from their last album. \\"Year Of Living Dangerously\\" is interesting lyrically but packaged in a rather dull melody line, and probably should have been left off. \\"Let's Have A Kiki\\" is humorous and a side of Scissor Sisters we seldom hear, but they really should explore this side because this song demonstrates their uniqueness as a band. Same goes for \\"Shady Love\\". The rap/singing is something the band hasn't tried before and it works quite well within the confines of a dance song. The other great track here is the Spanish flavored \\"San Luis Obispo\\" with its irresistible melodic hook and it's hopeful, yearning lyrics, the song is quite a departure for the band and they should have tried this approach more here because they really pull it off.<br /><br />\\"Self Control\\" is a droning dance electronic track that is fine, and \\"Best In Me\\" is another catchy track. I agree with most of the reviewers who pointed out that \\"The Secret Life Of Letters\\" is the worst song here. It goes absolutely nowhere. They should have left it off. Album closer \\"Somewhere\\" is another solid track with more soul searching. All in all, of the 12 tracks, the only dud is \\"The Secret Life Of Letters\\". \\"F--- Yeah\\" is okay for a bonus dance cut. The two remixes and the brief message from Ana Matronic, were, in my not so humble opinion, a complete waste of space and time.<br /><br />All this being said, I have to give more criticism. Scissor Sisters burst onto the scene in 2004 with a re-packaging of a bygone era of music, and when I listened to that debut album again, along with their other albums, I was reminded that the band still have work to do. I like them, but I wouldn't say they're one of my favorites because they continue to walk the side of the fence of playing it safe. This band has so much potential to break out of the cult following and into the mainstream, yet they just miss the mark with each release. Back in the day, a band could take up to 10 albums before finally maturing into a great band and finding their identity in the musical world--just listen to Hall & Oates, Rush, Inxs, U2, Blondie, and yes, even The Beatles and The Beach Boys.<br /><br />So my hope is this: I want the band to go back to the drawing board and pretend like their record company has given them an ultimatum--either deliver a hit album or we drop you from our label. I mean, if ABC could deliver the excellent and whimsical \\"How To Be A Zillionaire\\" back in 1985, Scissor Sisters can certainly do the same!<br /><br />Here's how \\"Magic Hour\\" compares to Scissor Sisters' previous works:<br /><br />2004 Scissor Sisters: Three and a Half Stars<br />2006 Ta-Dah: Four Stars<br />2010 Night Work: Four Stars<br />2012 Magic Hour: Four Stars2012 Magic Hour: Four Stars

0345803507|3.0|It's hard to just review this book because all 3 put together I would give it 4 stars.<br /><br />I have read the criticisms of the books regarding their lack of true BDSM sex, juvenile, repetitive sex scenes and the heroine being WAY to naive....but I still liked the series.  I couldn't put it down and finished all 3 in a week, sleep be damned.  I liked the parts when they fought and there was unexpected danger more than the love story.  Towards the end I started to skim the sex scenes...only so many times he can tilt her chin, allow her clothes to pool at her feet or demand that she orgasm.  I was also annoyed at how dependent they both were.<br /><br />But even with those criticisms, I enjoyed the books, would recommend that not as serious reads, but definitely by the pool summer fun.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is a lot of fun. loads of games that you can play. its easy to buy the games. I would recommend this game to anyone

B007U1FEJE|5.0|A wonderful production. Great classic Beach Boy harmonies, wonderful arrangements, great tunes you can understand what's being sung, familiar Beach Boy riffs and song structure developments without it sounding like prior Beach Boy songs. Not one filler in the bunch. I could listen to this over and over. Don't miss this opportunity to really getting your money's worth from one of the best bands in history.
B0048LPRD2|1.0|Aside from being a vehicle for de La Heurta's nudity, this movie is a movie that I would have walked out on had I been in a theater.  Artsy-farsy individuals may think it is special.<br /><br />Save the money and the 3 hours of your life and choose something better.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|I can tell get over this app! I want to dmgo through my gallery and edit all my photos! The options are much more detailed than the Photoshop editing Android app and PicShop has way more features.<br />You can do all the basics, like brightness and contrast exposure, hues and saturation, by yourself or by pressing the auto button. You can apply filters like Lomo, vintage and high contrast as well as several colored lenses. You can add text, stamps and frames. Even layers.<br />The only thing I didn't like (seriously, the one thing) was that the buttons were a little sensitive to the touch. Sometimes I press &quot;Cancel&quot; when I mean &quot;Ok.&quot; That's a small price to pay for the awesomeness of this program, though!

B003M5AXN4|5.0|As a child I admit to always hating the original 70's anime. No one two characters were more annoying to me than that boy and his monkey. I refused to watch the live movie adaptation for the longest (3 years?) until recently. To my surprise it was a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />For all its silliness and gross abundance of CGI it is a good film for the entire family to sit through with a little bit of everything for everyone. More so I found the setting of a petrol-free world where the highest stakes are vested on racing machines more believable than the outrageous thuggery of the Fast & Furious franchise.

B004BEMC6G|4.0|Salt is an excellent spy thriller that keeps you guessing throughout the whole movie.  I think I rented it about 3 times and couldn't get enough of it, so I had to buy it.  The movie is intense from the first five minutes, and never slows down.  Hope they make a sequel...
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I absolutely love this app. I tried Doodletext but it wouldn't give me as many options as this. I highly reccomend this to everyone.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its pretty good for being free. I would recommend it as a way to cure boredom. its free so what do you have to lose :)
B0086700CM|1.0|It isn't  that  good of a game and it can get really boring...if you play it once you've played it a million times...very addictive and it wastes your time...Think of it this way...if you only have a limited amount of free games you can get THIS GAME WOULD WASTE ONE OF THEM AND YOU CAN'T GET IT BACK!!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!! I HATE IT AND I'M SURE A LOT OF PEOPLE DO TOO
B007C94QRK|2.0|Wish I had rented this movie instead of buying it... My 8 year old liked it but it didn't have the same humor of the Muppets I grew up with. Just seemed like all the human actors were over exaggerating their parts.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I joined the bandwagon and decided to read this book. I could not put it down till it was done. I thoroughly enjoyed it; i've read it twice and plan on reading it again soon. Such a good read.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game and it works as well as the apple products I have been waiting forever for this to be on the kindle and it works awesomely and it is a little slow but that's it.!!!!!!!!!!!
0609610570|1.0|If you understand finance, you won't enjoy this book.  Within the first few chapters, the author argues that financials should not be taken into consideration when making a 'top-level' decision.  Interesting.
B0061TQBRK|4.0|I have \\"some\\" of Lacuna's releases, \\"Comalies\\" and this one....I have listened to other releases. I like them, but have found them to be a \\"difficult\\" listen at times. Their last release did not thrill me...I thought it was Boring.<br />This CD is Better....there is some Complexity in the Sounds....thought provoking lyrics....and more Vocals....I<br />particularly Enjoyed \\"End of Time\\" and for me, that's why I enjoy the CD. Past releases just don't have the standout songs.....This one i think Does. I like hearing Words. When \\"noise\\" distorts vocals...its annoying and doesn't work for me. Thankfully its not the case here. Good CD, a very Distinctive Effort by Lacuna Coil.<br />BTW Nice  cover of REM's \\"Losing My Religion\\"!<br /><br />atreides

0142000663|5.0|In this novel about Oklahoma farmers forced by the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression to seek a new life for themselves as migrant laborers in California, John Steinbeck may well have written the Great American Novel.  \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is the story of the Joad family, but it's also the story of a people on the move, a nation in crisis, and humanity in its extremes of greed and goodness.<br /><br />The first quarter of the novel tells of young Tom Joad's homecoming after several years in prison for killing a man in a drunken brawl.  Contact with his family has been minimal over the years, and he looks forward to seeing his parents, grandparents, and siblings again - but the house is empty, obviously abandoned, like so many others in this land where a combination of drought and poor agricultural techniques has resulted in failure and foreclosure on countless family farms.  Fortunately, Tom learns from a neighbor that his family has gone over to his uncle's place, and he arrives there just in time to join them on their way to California, where they've been told there's plenty of work in the state's lush Central Valley.<br /><br />The second quarter of the novel is the story of the Joads' arduous journey west on Route 66, a trip distinguished by breakdowns, death, and intimations by those who have been there that California may be something less than the paradise they've been led to imagine.  The final half of the novel follows the Joads after they arrive in California, only to discover that it's possible to starve even in a land of plenty as too many would-be workers are forced to compete for available jobs by accepting wages barely sufficient to buy enough food from one day to the next.  The novel ends with one of the most stunning and affecting scenes you'll ever read, and although nothing at all is resolved, the story feels complete.<br /><br />The structure of the novel underscores Steinbeck's creation of the Joads as the human face of a social crisis.  Long chapters that advance the plot alternate with short chapters in which the Joads are never mentioned, in which Steinbeck's richly poetic prose establish the physical and moral setting of his work: the conditions leading to the Dust Bowl, the loss of a way of life, the journey to a new beginning, and the disillusionment and growing anger of the migrants - all on a massive scale.  These short, poignant chapters are as beautiful, captivating, and necessary as the story chapters, as they provide context and grant a kind of holy universality to the Joads' experiences.<br /><br />Steinbeck's writing is raw, earthy, and viscerally powerful.  This is realism at its finest: full of small, telling details, and at times casually vulgar, not for shock value but because life itself is casually vulgar.  I was about 13 the first time I read this novel, and the blunt honesty of the writing was a bit much for my somewhat sheltered mind; I remember feeling uncomfortable when an old man reached into his pants and \\"contentedly scratched under the testicles,\\" as that wasn't a word I was used to seeing in print, at least outside of biology texts.  I loved the background chapters but found the Joad chapters distasteful for the first hundred pages or so, when I finally allowed the vivid immediacy of Steinbeck's style to make the characters real for me.  As an adult, I have no such difficulties and am able to appreciate the masterful style and rich characterizations immediately.  This is a mature novel, about people too crassly human to elicit our pity, but too warmly human not to elicit our compassion.<br /><br />I must admit that as a native Californian, I feel a special connection with this novel.  For most of my life I lived just a few blocks away from the old Route 66 (although farther west than the point where the Joads left it to go north).  Several of my husband's children live in the Central Valley, around places Steinbeck mentions by name.  However, Steinbeck's skill is such that even if you've never been there, you'll close this novel feeling as though you had.  This is a novel every American should read - indeed, everyone interested in what it means to be human in trying times.  These days more than ever we need this book, we need this reminder of the values of proud self-sufficiency and fierce decency, for it is when we stop pulling, and pulling together, that we lose our way.en if you've never been there, you'll close this novel feeling as though you had.

B006ZB3V2C|5.0|I just love this app!!! I often have trouble falling asleep and would take over the counter sleeping pills. This is a beautiful app. It allows you customize the sounds that you wish to hear. I first started playing the jungle theme but decided I wanted the sounds of a Cairo marketplace,(go figure). It reminded me of my trip to Casablanca. I set it to play for 45 minutes and I never knew when it stopped coz I was knocked out.<br /> That jungle theme must have stuck with me because I had a dream about a big tropical beetle. LOL! I can mix and match different sounds and with one touch, remove a particular sound, like a frog, or I can set the volume on each individual sound. Many themes are downloadable at no extra cost.<br /> I listened to the beach theme this morning while cleaning the kitchen and imagined myself at a beach house. I had birds like seagulls and larks, waves crashing, and I like the wind chimes. This app also has beautiful screen savers to match the themes and some are animated. You can dull or brighten the light on the screen savers.<br /> This app is well worth it. Oh yeah, I have this app on my Galaxy Note and I used a bluetooth stereo speaker.
B007H9B8FS|4.0|For me, this is the Best I've heard from Garbage since my Fave...2.0. Succeeding CD's featured some Fine individual Tunes...This one just Hits you Every Song. There are Sounds that remind you of music you've heard from other groups...a la 1980's...and Sounds that just Hit You Hard. I like the \\"Automatic Systematic Habit\\"..but \\"Blood for poppies\\" will do just Fine! I Love Garbage. They were Great Livve on Saturday Night Live. They kicked ass doing the title Song for the Bond flick \\"World is not Enough\\" and much of the credit fgoes to Ms. Manson....There are not a lot of groups left out there that are as Exciting as Garbage. Right now...probably None. This CD makes you Hope for the Future of Music. Somehpow is Garbage is out there seven years after their last release Kicking Ass...You have to Believe they are not Alone. Love you Garbage!<br /><br />Atreides
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I liked getting this game. its also cool to get 120 some odd games for free!:) the reason I took away a star is because some of the games arnt as fun. for example, some are too hard and are almost impossible to complete. also, the graphics army very good..... other than that, its a pretty good game. :)
0446572993|5.0|I enjoy all of Baldacci's books. This is one of his best.<br /><br />So glad I brought it on vacation to Washington DC with me. Almost felt I was part of the scenes, local coffee shops, bars and all. Read it so fast I wished I had brought a second book. Don't miss taking this one.
B00006879E|5.0|I was out of town on business and went to the theater and saw Love Actually. Loved the sound track which I later bought and was mesmerized by the Maroon 5 medley on the sound track. Being in my sixties, I wondered \\"Who is Maroon 5?\\" Again out of town, I stop at a music store to buy this CD. Almost wrecked my car when I heard the opening salvo (now one of my favorite tracks on the CD) as it was far different than the medley on that movie soundtrack. I like this heart pounding/melodic mix of this CD so much I give it to everyone I know when it is present time. And then I follow it up with a present of the symphonic version. It is not every day you can find a CD that effectively weaves together different styles of music in a way that is effortless and harmonious. This one really delivers.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Many people had recommended that I read the Hunger Games, so I finally took the time to start it.  It only took a few nights to complete.  The characters are well-drawn, and it will be interesting to see how the story developes.  Not quite the literary quality of Harry Potter, but good.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game I play it everysingle day when I get home from yealey camp it is so fun to play love those game so much never in my live not play temple run love who ever maid this game you rock:)
B007D2XSW0|3.0|the app has potential, but It also does have some issues zooming in to the picture while you are editing. Please fix :)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game would be a total five stars if they could have pick some easier games to start off with because I still cant get past the bubble one or rocket
B00008BXJG|5.0|I have no idea which version or release I have, all of them lead here anyway.  I bought my copy in 2000 and never noticed any poor sound quality.  I don't think this is one of those bad re-releases I have read about.  Music-wise, AC/DC has always been solid, and this is one of my favorite of theirs.  At the time I purchased this, I only had 3 cd's to listen to so I have fond memories of this one.  I think this is without a doubt an essential to a person's collection.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Gives detailed info about battery life.  No more guessing whether I have to stop what I am doing to recharge the battery.
B004ZBFRTY|5.0|This movie is different. It makes no sense the first time you watch it, which makes it almost a mystery as to what happened.<br /><br />I think that this movie was very well made and has a well developed plot line. That being said, to this day I am still undecided what the movie is about. Regardless, it is still a good one to have in your collection, especially on Blu-Ray.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Excellent app well worth its cost. I recommend doing most of your work on a PC then downloading it to your Kindle. Word, Excel &amp; Powerpoint work perfectly well.
B00881VLCE|5.0|one of my favorites in my Kindle I do a puzzle a day I hope they don't stop adding puzzles, cant seem to not play it.. Definitely one to get..
B0063IH60K|4.0|Helps me take my mind off the stress of the day and just relax. Love to seat and play after diner when the kids are watching tv.
B00005QENZ|5.0|So maybe because I grew in the 1990's I like Pump, Get a Grip and Nine Lives better than the older albums (though I can't say the same thing for Black Sabbath or AC/DC...) or maybe its because of the higher production on these three.  It just seems that Get a Grip is charged with energy and carries that excitement through to the end.  And if anything the rock seems harder here than the older stuff as well.  I would recommend this album to anyone in my generation who was born in the 1980's, other listeners will probably enjoy the older stuff more.
159514188X|3.0|My middle school child's librarian had this on the summer reading list. She also indicated that she \\"loved this book.\\" Luckily, I decided to read this book first. After reading it, I was shocked to see it is recommended for 12+.  While the premise of the book is okay, I felt a lot of the content was too adult for a middle schooler. I have chosen to not allow my 7th grader to read this book. In the book, there is underage drinking and driving, a rape,and a sexual encounter among other horrible acts. While this may be accepted as normal teenage behavior, I don't want my child thinking that any of this is normal nor okay. I do feel that people are not aware of how their actions affect others and, in our current culture, even if they are aware-they simply don't care. If parents let their child read this book, they could use it as a tool to teach respect for others feelings, the effects of gossip, etc.
B000EZ7ZXQ|5.0|Although I am a fan of Adam Sandler, some of his films are stupid and have to much emphasis on drugs and sex. This did not. I really liked this movie because of the fact it was a comedy but yet a romance. The plot line is one that is becoming used more where the man has to continually make the girl fall in love with him. A good movie to have in your collection.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|tryed the app out for the first time and compleatly brang in new life to my old ugly pics, a must have for kindle owners!
B005IQZB14|4.0|An inspiring account of perseverance, courage, relationships, and self reflection. You cannot read this book without seeing the power we each have, and then asking if we allow ourselves to recognize our potential.  A meaningful and worthwhile read.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I didn't like the controls but over all love playing Cuz of the challenge it comes with. I am also teaching my two year old more
B0077SGMXM|5.0|solid physics.  fun power-ups.  tons of replay value.  I got it free, but absolutely worth the purchase price!  download recommended.  plays on my D2g and Transformer Prime.
B000O77SRC|5.0|Whenever the holidays swing around and that good will toward men sentiment threatens to manifest, I sift thru my DVD collection for my favorite Christmas film: DIE friggin' HARD!! That's right. In my household, it's not MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET or IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE or A CHRISTMAS STORY that gets copious playing time. Give me John McClane, barefoot and bloody exhausted and unappreciated, holed up in the Nakatomi building, trying hard to be that fly in the ointment and foil a twelve-man-crew of hi-tech terrorists. Give me that smartasss New York cop every time. Because John McClane, he earns his Christmas cheer.<br /><br />In 1988 DIE HARD founded an entire new action sub-genre. It influenced a slew of imitators: SPEED (DIE HARD on a bus), UNDER SIEGE (DIE HARD on a boat), SUDDEN DEATH (DIE HARD in a hockey arena), etc. DIE HARD propelled Bruce Willis to Hollywood's stratosphere. John McClane would only be the first of Willis' repertoire of lunch pail everyman heroes. Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Richard Gere, and Burt Reynolds have probably kicked themselves ad nauseam for turning down this part. Their loss, our gain. No other actor could've packed this role with so much humanity and vulnerability and wiseassery. Could you imagine Stallone trapped in Nakatomi Plaza? I shudder.<br /><br />I've got mad love for this film, so maybe that renders me blind to its faults, because I can't see any. There's such a strong human element to the storytelling. We observe the tension between McClane and his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia). We note the world-weary camaraderie between McClane and his one L.A. cop ally, Sgt. Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson). McClane and Al's talks via radio are only some of the fantastic grace notes strewn throughout the film. These are actors on top of their game. Even the ancillary characters feel three-dimensional (okay, maybe not the two gung-ho FBI guys). Alan Rickman, making his big screen debut, is pitch perfect as the big bad. The cat-and-mouse games enacted between his snotty Hans Gruber and the blue-collar McClane provide some of the film's most crowd-pleasing moments.<br /><br />Down the years DIE HARD has earned a well-deserved rep as a rousing non-stop action thriller. So it's all the more amazing that the first 20 minutes doesn't have any violence at all, or, in fact, anything ominous. Director John McTiernan takes the time to set things up, to develop John McClane as a full-blooded character. After those 20 minutes, when the fit hits the shan and that sense of urgency just escalates, we're gripped hard and totally on board.<br /><br />The sequels, while good, aren't quite as good because A) that sense of familiarity kicks in and B) the franchise kept expanding McClane's playground. Ensuing films went away from one of the original's strengths, which is one man trapped in a CONFINED SPACE with a bunch of killers. There is so much suspense in that premise. McTiernan's precision camera work establishes that sense of claustrophobic space and, in familiarizing the audience with its geography, elevates the Nakatomi building into a supporting character.<br /><br />DIE HARD brings us back to an age when our heroes didn't automatically throw down with the kung fu. John McClane, refreshingly, is a brawler, a bruiser, someone who wades in there swinging and maybe issuing a sneaky elbow or two. McClane is not indestructible (at least not in the first DIE HARD). He doesn't easily dispatch his assailants. He is taxed to his very limits. This makes him a much more compelling protagonist and it is hugely why those jeopardized moments crackle with such white-knuckle suspense. We easily identify with him. And I love his strokes of ingenuity, his knack for improvising under duress.<br /><br />And, omigod, he's so funny. John McClane is hilarious. The best thing about his humor is that it feels organic and unforced and off the cuff. Credit Willis for having ad-libbed most of those lines.<br /><br />So one badge, one unexpected guest, desperate and wounded, must outwit and outfight a professional crew of villains in a sealed-off highrise, even as thirty people, including his wife, are held hostage. And what part of that doesn't speak Christmas to you?

B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This game is one of my favorite. It is a tad hard to play on a Kindle Fire, because of the fact you use your finger to draw the pictures, but it is still fun. I also have the app on my iPhone.  I haven't played it in a few weeks, so things may have been updated, but I did notice a lot of repeated words. Not a huge deal if you're playing with multiple people. A larger variety would still be fun.
0345803485|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, I immediately purchased book 2 and 3 without a doubt, I'm know book worm and to me this was a mind babbling, interesting, intoxicating, \\"cant put down\\". I think the other reviews are way to harsh!...Open up your minds people..Awesome Job James...I'm looking out for anything you write that comes after.....
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I've never written a review on Amazon or any other site before, but for this I just had to. Hopefully, I'll do it justice. This was an amazing story! The premise, once it starts to unravel, was thought provoking. Also, I loved how it started out simply as just one man's story but then with each installment the web of characters was sprawling.  It occurred to me that it was very much a reflection of life in the silo. At first, in book 1, each person seemed isolated, but then in book 5 there was a feeling of wholeness and encompassment. The entanglement I felt with the characters as a unit as well as individuals was incredible. I found my self weeping for Marck. A character that Howey spent very little time on but somehow was able to make me connect with. I also found myself hyperventilating a little, gasping for breath while Juliette suited up especially the second time. I can't give it away. Read it and you'll understand. Maybe I over thought and over analyzed the whole thing, but it has been a long time since I read something that resonated with me the way \\"Wool\\" has.  Have to go get #6!! Thank you to the author for a wonderful read so far!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Pretty fun so far, good waste of time, I hate the snake game, I want my points right now now now.

B0086700CM|5.0|This game is really fun and it never ends. It is about an explorer running away from demon monkeys on a temple wall. It has easy instructions and is very understandable. This is a game everyone should have.
1416955070|4.0|I got this out of the library, since I kept on hearing about Clare. I read it after a bunch of other YA fantasy books that were basically just regurgitated knock-offs that are so predictable and lame that it's not funny (I do enjoy that type of book a bit, but anything better is not a problem at all). I read City of Bones in about four hours, all in one go, and did enjoy it a bit more than some of the others. I figured many of the twists in this story out, but not one of the larger ones. Honestly, that was a bit refreshing because I can tell what's going to happen too soon in most books (which usually have only one or two twists).<br /><br />Basically, Clary Fray and her best friend Simon (who is basically a nerd) go to an under-21 club and she sees some kids kill another kid. The strange part is that nobody else seems to see them. The kids explain to her that they are Nephilim, descendants of both angels and humans, also called Shadowhunters. Their task is to kill demons. Of course, there's a problem because mundanes like Clary aren't supposed to see things like Shadowhunters. So one of the Shadowhunters, Jace, meets up with her. Meanwhile, Clary's mom goes missing, and the family friend Luke (who has always been Clary's father-figure, since her dad died before she was born) wants nothing to do with her. Of course, everything is related. There's this evil ex-Shadowhunter, thought to have died with his family sixteen years before, named Valentine, who needs the Mortal Cup to complete his evil plans. The Cup's been missing since the first time he stole it from the organization of Shadowhunters who live in a magical country in Europe, and as it turns out, Clary's mom had stolen it from him and hidden it. Her mom and Luke were both Valentine's followers, part of his Circle (as it was called), along with the parents and tutor of Clary's new Shadowhunter friends. Everyone in the Circle was either exiled or hid out in the mundane world and changed their name. Of course, that means that it's up to Clary to defeat Valentine.<br /><br />It's a bit like a condensed Harry Potter version that's been watered down by about 20,000 pages, with a bit of Star Wars mixed in. I also kept on thinking of The Secret Circle (the TV show). It has a backstory, but I think this book could have used a bit more fleshing out and more characters to sell it. With all the twists and turns, there could have been two books and still had enough surprise in each. Also, how are five kids supposed to defeat a big baddie who's escaped death before when one kid is a mundane and another is all but one, too? It's like Hagrid telling Harry Potter that he's going to kill Voldemort right after telling him he's a wizard. If there had been a part of the story with a bit of training, or even several, things would have been better, because everyone is kind of learning and getting better and working toward the goal of being able to stop Valentine. The one thing that I could have used less of, rather than more, is foreshadowing. Everything just became too obvious at least 150 pages before the \\"big reveal\\" while the characters screamed their heads off about how they didn't understand. And the one that I didn't get, if I had thought about it more (as in, if I had put the book down for more than half an hour), I probably could have because there were a few details that weren't quite adding up from what I had figured out.<br /><br />As far as characters went, I never really could picture Jace, for some reason. He didn't seem real. I felt like I just never read a good description of him and he acted so strangely at times that I never understood why or how or anything. He was a jerk, definitely, and he was hot and therefore the supposed or at least probable love interest (he also seems like the love interest almost by ruling out all of the other kids). But that was it about him. Isabel also could have been a stronger character than her role as basically competition for Clary's possible love interests, Simon and Jace. Alec also fills this role a bit. I think Clary should have been able to get along with at least one of them a bit more than what she did.<br /><br />One thing that I found nearly ingenious was that the narration switched from Clary to the boy in the club she found cute (who was a demon). You felt for the demon, and it actually confused me a bit at first as to why the kids who were going to kill him included Jace, since he was the good guy from what it said on the back of the book, but were obviously at odds with the kid who seemed to be good. I don't think I've ever seen a more intriguing or unusually-styled beginning.<br /><br />While parts of the story were refreshing, many others were also decidedly lacking. I think that the book should have been handled differently, more than anything else, and parts of it should have been questioned by the author and editor. \\"Why is this part written this way and how could this have been handled smoother?\\" or even \\"Will this really make sense and be believable?\\" The plot and most of the characters were promising, and hopefully the characters will become more interesting and filled out in the rest of the trilogy, which I haven't read yet.le love interests, Simon and Jace.

0099579936|4.0|Ugh, how I hated it. I hated how the main character, Ana, let Christian walk all over her. I hated how there was no depth to the characters. I hated the sex scenes. BUT, being the avid reader I am, I just couldnt let myself read the first few chapters and then put the book down, thus not getting to see what the ending was. Boy am I glad I forced myself! As the story progresses towards the end of the first and then continuing to the second and third, I could not for the life of me put my e-reader down! The plot is addictive!
1609611543|1.0|This is a terribly misleading book. A healthy life for most people means a balanced diet and plenty of exercise. Blaming one of the world's oldest staple crops for rising obesity rates is scientifically unjustified and, frankly, laughable. Common sense would deem this author incredible.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|I think it's my favorite game since the mad flying animals.  Mini golf meets physics puzzle.  I can't figure out what to do with golf bux, though.  A little help?
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|Just another intricate, involving story! Lee Child has an amazing mind...must do an enormous amount of research.  I thoroughly enjoyed this novel.

B0083GNOYW|2.0|ok seriously robin sucks and ruins this show especially in this season. the last episode was great up until the last few seconds of it. err made me soo mad
B007JYDOI0|5.0|Sarah's Key is one of those books that just rips your heart out.  It starts with 2 stories, alternating from Sarah's story, as a Jewish child, in Paris, July 1942, when the Jews were rounded up and shipped off to the camps, and the present, where an American woman, in Paris is given the assignment to write up the story of the roundup.  She gets involved in Sarah's story, and it consumes her.  It's not a happy book, but it's one that's hard to put down.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is so fun me and my kids love to play all day long. I just cant get enough of it.
B0086700CM|5.0|I got this for my Kindle Fire and I love it! I spent more time playing than I realized. It's very addicting!
031617615X|4.0|Bella is one of the strongest characters.  Her strength and passion carries the entire book.  The relationship between Edward and Jacob is explored and their relationship holds up to the ultimate test.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I watched this movie with my family and everyone loved, it. We laughed and cheered.<br />I will certainly be buying this on DVD. Great movie
B0064X7FVE|4.0|this is a really good app for weather. I like it because it lets you have multiple locations saved to the app. its really good for kindle fire. it has a really nice feature that lets you look at tweets and video.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|Would give a higher star but I need Wifi to use it at my church so this isn't good for my usage there. I do use it at home.
B003O86FMW|4.0|book # 2 of the Trilogy. Interesting. A must read IF you read Hunger Games as the first one! Then read the last one too. You miss the characters when the books are over!
B00782O7NE|5.0|There are already a lot of other reviews on Amazon based on the theatrical version of this Oscar-winning film and there seems to be a wide disparity of \\"likes\\" and \\"dislikes\\". I'm not sure what many folks expected and, honestly, when you compare this lovely, sweet, simple film with the 3-D blockbusters, it's in a different ballpark. As for me - a guy who loves old silent films and period music - this film tied with \\"Hugo\\" as the best films of 2011.  That said, I'll move on to \\"new territory\\" and concentrate on the DVD (particularly the Blu-ray) DVD release.<br /><br />Of all the top Oscar-nominated films from 2011, \\"The Artist\\" is the last to see a home video release. But the Weinstein Company (who produced the film) wisely chose take the time, chose Sony Pictures as packager and distributors, at is finally available for those who loved it in the theater to watch again and again and let those who missed it, discover it.<br /><br />Beginning with the packaging - slipcase that opens like a book to review some classic images - and continuing on to the multitude of \\"bonus feature\\" - this is a classy production. These \\"bonuses\\" include:<br /><br />A \\"blooper reel\\" (2 minutes) that is really the only weak one since it's hard to appreciate \\"bloopers\\" in a SILENT film.<br /><br />A \\"making of\\" short  (21 minutes) that mixes a bit of early sound film history (from film historian Wade Major) with comments from the cast and production team.<br /><br />A \\"Q& A with the filmmakers and cast\\" (except for John Goodman and Malcolm McDowell) at UCLA (a whopping 44 minutes!). There are some interesting tidbits of info here including the fact that the shoot was only 35 days and that the scenes were transferred at 22 frames per second giving it the feel of an older film.<br /><br />Four short features on the \\"Artisans Behind the film\\" (total 11 minutes) covering the costumes, score, cinematography and production design. The extra joy here is seeing the gorgeous costumes in COLOR.<br /><br />\\"Hollywood as a Character: The Locations\\" (5 minutes) on the actual locates in Hollywood that were used.<br /><br />If anything, the one feature I'd have liked is one on Uggie, the dog who plays a major role. Uggie, is not even mentioned (well one in the Q&A) in any of the special features.<br /><br />One of my fellow reviewers mentioned the image of the Blu-ray (which is presented in standard 1:33 format. I actually have a  30 year-old 27-inch standard screen Sony television and the image looks great! Since this film is in black and white and is trying to recreate a film from the late 1920s the sharpness is not as important and it might look better on an older TV than a new HD, wide-screen, one. But, for me, it's the story and the acting (and the wonderful score - check out the soundtrack CD) that make this a joy to watch.<br /><br />My only gripe - and this DVD is not the only one with this problem - is that you cannot easily skip past the \\"previews\\" (and there are plenty of them on this DVD) when you reload the DVD. I enjoy having the previews to watch ONCE (some great Weinstein/Sony releases here), but it's annoying to have to have them continuously pop up first.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"br />\\"Hollywood as a Character: The Locations\\" (5 minutes) on the actual locates in Hollywood that were used.<br /><br />If anything, the one feature I'd have liked is one on Uggie, the dog who plays a major role.

B007D2XSW0|4.0|Pretty good app. It let's you do a lot of editing with your phone and is very easy to use. I recommend this app. The only gripe is the 20 word minimum for this review.
B004ZJZQ5G|3.0|Ok I admit I've never read the novel but.......... This video seemed over-edited. It was hard to follow the actual story behind all the glitzy visual grandeur.  The audio kept going up & down, depending on when the director wanted you to know \\"hey, wake up, this is an important, emotional scene\\". Donald Sutherland was catatonic..you call that acting???
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Suzanne Collins' The Hunger Games is a haunting and cliffhanging start to her trilogy. In a land once known as North America, thirteen districts uprise against their Capitol. Tweleve were defeated, the thirteenth destroyed. As a symbolism of power to the districts, the Capitol hosts the annual Hunger Games, taking a boy and girl from each one and having them fight to death.<br />Katniss' younger sister, Prim, is named tribute.<br />Katniss volunteers.<br />Performing various stunts against the Capitol, Katniss bends the rules, keeping the other tribute alive.<br />She either wins or dies.<br />May the odds ever be in your favor.<br />Let the Hunger Games begin.
0345529057|5.0|I am in no way an avid reader . I rarely spend the time to sit down and read a book. But these books are absolutely captivating period . Once you pick the first book up you have to keep reading. Highly recommend
B003IKMR0U|5.0|We love this game, even my 6-year-old niece can't get enough of it. For most, it can be learned within a minute or two. Surprisingly, it actually is educational for young children, as it requires counting and basic addition. Zombie Dice is one of those cheap, simple games that you can't put down.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Great graphics &amp; game play. Invest points too slow to earn. Would rather pay for game &amp; not have to pay for invest points or wait to earn them.  I prefer Time Management games but this is a good game.
B00571F26Y|4.0|The information was presented in a very convincing case.  It helped me understand the problems created, within the body by consumption of our current type of wheat crops.
B004QOB8SO|1.0|The actor who plays Watson is outstanding. The actor who plays Sherlock must be one terrific actor to play a character who appears to have no depth, is arrogant, and really quite boring. The stories are boring. The stories jump around for no logical reason.
B004RKXNDU|4.0|This was my first spy book and I have to say the book was good, probably great but I don't think I am a big spy fan.  Having said that, I saw the trailer for the movie and really wanted to read the book.  It is written with a lot of British slang and was a little slower for me to read than other books.  I got the flow of it about a quarter of the way into it.<br /><br />Still the story is great and the characters are very well developed.  The plot if very complex and keeps you engaged until the very end.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Really elegant interface, and full of features! I especially love how simple and intuitive it is to use! I definitely would have paid for this app, but luckily caught it when it was FAOTD. [HTC Rezound]
B00785P2QC|5.0|It's a great app  to buy. I enjoy receiving the rewards when advancing in the game. Everyone in the family can enjoy it.
B0086700CM|4.0|I actually really enjoy this game.  Yes, its repetitive but I think it's a good mixture of action and &quot;chillness&quot;. I like to play it after work to do something mindless but entertaining. Once in a blue moon it gets laggy but I restart my kindle I'm usually back to normal.
B004132HZS|1.0|I usually like British shows, Rosemary and Thyme, Poirot, Midsomer Murders, Foyle's War (especially Honeysuckle Weeks), and others. The Sherlock stories are boring to me. I do not  enjoy watching the character Sherlock.
0060734191|5.0|I absolutely LOVE these books. I've read them at least three different times and when in a time of need of a great book to read, I always go back to these ones!!
B007MS5B6Q|1.0|The collector's edition is effen awesome but I'm screwed out of it cause I don't have a blu-ray player :/  which is a shame cause I'm a huge fan and totally would of bought the dvd collectors version if there was one.
B004UID2LC|1.0|I downloaded this app two weeks ago and within a few hours of the day I purchased it my KF shut down. when I turned it back on it was automatically restoring its settings back to factory default settings! my apps were in my cloud of course but everthing else was just gone! As a friend I'm telling you now... please do not download.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|I was absolutely blown away with the Bluray release of this. The picture is crisper than any other bluray that I own by a long shot, and the world James Cameron created is definitely best viewed in high quality. The movie itself was good; predictable plot but fresh characters, scenery, and the occasional twist to keep you interested. I'd highly highly highly recommend this if you're looking to build a bluray collection or add to your current one, this is the best movie to show off your system with!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is a fun game for kids that don't have a ton of time on their hands.  you don't need to constantly watch it but it amuses me and keeps my attention every time I have time to play it.
034580404X|3.0|I give this only three stars, but not because of the actual book.  The books themselves are fantastic.  However, I purchased the trilogy, and it was in a celophane sealed box set, but instead of one of each 3 books, it contained the first one and two copies of the second one.  And of course I didn't realize this until I had already read the first one, and thrown away all the packaging.  However, as a testament to Amazon's good customer service, when I contacted them, they did offer to give me a replacement.  I didn't want a replacement though, just the 3rd book.  So they refunded me the price of one of the books, and I'm just going to run to my local bookstore and buy it, to save me the time of having to wait for shipping, so I can finish the series (which is rather addictive, and now that I have started it, I must finish it).  So.  Perhaps purchase the books SEPARATELY.  It's the same price, and it may take you an extra 30 seconds to click each one into your cart, but at least you know you'll receive one of each book that way!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I loved this app from the start. its fun and easy to use &amp; it makes all pics look a lot better
0201633612|3.0|Having this book is like owning an historical relic because of its groundbreaking nature and nice textbook appearance.  It's fun to see where we started from in design patterns, but the actual content is a bit dry and challenging to apply in modern circumstance due to lack of concrete examples.  As others have mentioned, there are better books out there which are language and\or domain specific that are easier to digest.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I love this game it is awesome. but my friend just got hers updated....I need mine uptaded but when I see the add to update I press it but it does not work.  there seem to many complaints on this
0345803507|5.0|I cant say enough good things about this series!! Of course its not for everyone..but I myself have enjoyed it...This one is just as good if not better then the other ones!! WOAH cant wait til the author comes out with a new series I will be the first one in line waiting!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|once my friend's showed me this game I thought it would be a piece of crap. but when I began to play it I was amazed of how addictive it was. now 101 games is my favorite game
B007XHWROK|5.0|When I've listened to three songs, Catching Feelings, Right Here (Featuring Drake) and Be Alright fr-<br />om this CD, I was thrilled! I also love his hit single, Boyfriend! This is an outstanding CD and I'm<br />going to buy it real soon!!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|this is a good good way of reading a bible and to be lazy and have electronics also.i am just kidding but this is a really good app!:)
B007SGM084|5.0|Fifty Shades of wonderful!  So many people were talking about this book that I had to try it.  Every day, I'm thankful that I have my kindle for reading and, since starting this series, never more so.  The waiting list at my local bookstore for these books would have driven me around the bend but, thankfully, with my kindle, I can buy them with a touch of a button.  while friends were waiting patiently for new orders of the books to come in, I was happily reading away and spending some deliciously decadent hours reading about Ana and Christian.  Each book was just as entertaining as the next.  Some twists and turns kept me coming back for more.  I'm reading the epilogue of the third book and know that it's ending soon.  Please, please, let there be a book four!!!!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Marcus Lattrell and his team are all true American heroes. It took me 3 days to complete,there is no dull moment to speak of. A very thrilling chain of events,but of course sad. Gives an insight of being a member of the Navy Seals and all of what they do to protect our country's interests. The dedication to their service and country is extraordinary.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|Prometheus and the space ship are symbolic of Western civilization; the movie is a political allegory about how the global network of parasitical, usurious, NWO Central Banksters and their poisonous fiat money scams have drained the lifeblood out of Europe and the US.<br /><br />Prometheus, who endured terrible suffering to give the gift of fire (creativity) to the Greeks (Western civilization), nevertheless decides to kill his progeny -- the humans who carry his DNA. Why? He concludes that neither he nor his progeny -- represented by the crew -- are capable of defending themselves against the ruthless, bloodsucking aliens. Rather than let his descendants become hosts for the destructive parasites, who cannot survive on their own without attaching themselves to a captive host population, Prometheus, as father, decides (as did the Romans) to exercise his right and responsibility to kill the members of his household -- earthlings.<br /><br />Elizabeth Shaw, however, shows herself to be worthy of -- and even more inventive than -- her self-sacrificing progenitor, Prometheus. She tears the abominable alien parasite from her womb; she instructs her noble crew to save the earth by ramming their spaceship into Prometheus' ship to keep it from destroying earth; and she asserts her faith in Christendom by demanding that David give her the cross; she vows to go in search of her Maker despite the difficulties. The Germanische android, David, who served his grasping slavemaster Weyland, who showed himself willing to sacrifice the safety of the earth as well as the ship and its crew to prolong his own fading life, switches his allegiance from Weyland to Elizabeth. In David's words, Elizabeth has shown \\"a remarkable sense of self-preservation.\\" David does all he can to help Elizabeth -- his unemotional, pristine intelligence is curious to know whether she can complete her quest.<br /><br />The question remains: Will the United States eliminate the financial parasites and show thesame sense of self-preservation as Elizabeth and the same sense of patriotic duty as her crew.<br /><br />Just as God entrusted a woman, Mary, to give birth to Jesus, God has entrusted another woman, Elizabeth, to tear the Satanic parasite (the antithesis of Jesus) from her womb. Mary was victorious in her mission of giving birth to the light -- and Ridley Scott implies that Elizabeth will also be victorious in her mission to re-kindle the protective light of Christianity that has been deliberately and systematically dimmed in Western societies. Will the Hollywood Cabal subject Ridley Scott to the same defamation campaigns and \\"honey pots\\" that they inflicted on Mel Gibson in revenge for his movie, The Passion of Christ?
B007D2XSW0|5.0|this app lets you edit all the photos in your kindle fire gallery.  it works for any device.  I love this app so much I'm on it 24-7 :)
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Awesome, I would highly recommend getting this app, you won't regret buying. Best part is I got it free during one of amazons daily free app.
B005HSL626|5.0|I unlocked everything then I had to delete it and get it again I lost everything oh well it only took me to days
B005LAIGN2|5.0|Great movie! Being in the Air Force and watching it in Afghanistan at an Air Base made it twice as good!
B00633W614|5.0|Wonderful book, I read this in like less than a week. The only bad part is I have to wait for the next installment of the story. The aspect of the writing is well put together. You see a different aspect of the story between the different characters and how they view the same situations. It is quite enthralling to read, this is a real page-turner and worth getting now.
0307719219|4.0|The virtuous circle works through several mechanisms. First, the logic of pluralistic political institutions makes usurpation of power by a dictator, a faction within the government, or even a well-meaning president much more difficult, as Franklin Roosevelt discovered when he tried to remove the checks on his power imposed by the Supreme Court, and as Sir Robert Walpole discovered when he attempted to summarily implement the Black Act. In both cases, concentrating power further in the hands of an individual or a narrow group would have started undermining the foundations of pluralistic, political institutions and the true measure of pluralism is precisely its ability resist such attempts.<br /><br />Pluralism also enshrines the notion of the rule of law, the principle that laws should be applied equally to everybody - something that is naturally impossible under an absolutist monarchy. But the rule of law, in turn, implies that laws cannot simply be used by one group to encroach upon the rights of another. What's more, the principle of the rule of law opens the door for greater participation in the political process and greater inclusivity, as it powerfully introduces the idea that people should be equal not only before law but also in the political system.<br /><br />Second, as we have seen several times before, inclusive political institutions support and are supported by inclusive economic institutions. This creates another mechanism of the virtuous  economic institutions remove the most egregious extractive economic relations, such as slavery and serfdom, reduce the importance of monopolies, and create a dynamic economy, all of which reduces the economic benefits that one can secure, at least in the short run, by usurping political power.<br /><br />Finally, inclusive political institutions allow a free media to flourish, and a free media often provides information about and mobilizes opposition to threats against inclusive institutions, as it did during the last quarter of the nineteenth century and first quarter of the twentieth century, when the increasing economic domination of the Robber Barrons was threatening the essence of inclusive economic institutions in the United States.<br />________________________________________________<br /><br />Synopsis: Political inclusive institutions (pluralism) support inclusive economic institutions (free markets). That's a good thing. Extractive institutions (dictatorships) use their power to enrich themselves at the expense of society. That's a bad thing.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This little sharpener is great. Its small and thin enough to fit in your pocket or small compartment. It works great and does the job really well. I was Impressed when i first tried it on a few really dull cheap knives and it made them just as sharp as a razor. All around, its an amazing sharpener.
B0083EW97W|5.0|The new JM album is brilliant. Easily, the best music of the summer. Clear choice for a good road trip, highly suggested for a good life. Musically and lyrically on point. If you do not add Born and Raised to the musical soundtrack of your life, you are truly missing out.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|it installed fine but then it just crashes,if I had payed 5.00 for I would have been so mad nut today I got it free so it was not a big deal
B001AQO446|5.0|When I saw the price on this Blu-Ray DVD, I had to have it.  The free digital download was nice to have, as I watched part of the movie while waiting for my disc to arrive.  One of my favorite 'escapist' movies, pure fun and entertainment from start to finish.  'Blues Brothers' has some of the most inspired silliness and humor ever, in a cutting edge, for the time, big budget blockbuster setting.  It hits on all cylinders the whole way through.  The transfer to Blu-Ray is fine, crisp, clear and detailed.  I am no expert on all the ins and outs of Blu-Ray viewing, but I can tell you as a long time fan of this movie through multiple viewings, it has never looked or sounded this good.  I am guessing that most who read this review will be big fans of the movie, but for those not familiar with it, I will point out that it is worth watching just for the musical numbers alone.  There are many priceless 'moments musical' throughout, but 3 of my favorites are Aretha Franklin's 'Think', 'Rawhide',  and especially Cab Calloway doing his long time favorite 'Minnie the Moocher'.  I get chills every time I watch that one!  It is definitely worth going onto YouTube to see videos of him doing the longer versions of the song at various points in his long career.  But I digress.  The movie itself is a blast to watch, and gets better with each viewing.  This DVD is now my default way to watch it.  Definitely recommended for fans and fans-to-be of this classic, esp. at Amazon's great price.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app. Tells you all you need to know about weather in your home and other States and countries. Recommend.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is a awesome. game for game for friends and family even when your on the rode and have no Internet
B007NESBK2|5.0|Bring me home - live video is very good. All moments from concetr was captured very professional. Sophie Muller did a great gob creating this film. All effects are visible and Sade is just perfect. The film includes also behind-the-scenes footage of Adu and her bandmates rehearsing, hanging out on their tour bus and goofing off. Definitely buy this...it really is amazing and worth the wait!!!
B00275EGX8|1.0|I cannot BELIEVE that this movie has been so garlanded.  To be fair, it may play better in a cinema than at home, but of all the Best Picture Academy Award winners, it has to be one of the dullest and least satisfying of all time.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|When I first read the Percy Jackson series I was addicted I read the hole series in less than a week and I loved the ending.  But then going into this new series with the same concept.I was thrilled but while reading it I felt that Jason seemed to much like Percy and the heroics and such. Also the 3rd person was not the best choice in my opinion. But overall the book was fantastic. Plus after seeing the mark of Athena and the look on the cover Percy and Jason fight I hoped that Percy would kick the crap out of Jason because Percy is the bestest eva. I would read it but strongly suggest u read the Percy Jackson series first. :)  sorry. For the bad grammar I suck at that stuff
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great app.  It works perfect for my needs.  I don't need anything complicated.  I also like the large easy to read keys.  If you're looking for a simple easy to use calculator,  then this one is for you.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I absolutely love the story line and acting all throughout the show!  I tend to be extremely critical of actors and actresses I see on TV because I am an aspiring actress.  Everyone in the show acts as naturally as people who are being recorded without knowing! There is a perfect mixture of future, past, and present in the story to show the differences between rich, poor, and everything in between, based mainly on the different worlds people live in.  I absolutely love the different personalities of  every single crew member working in Serenity (the name of the ship for anyone who doesn't know).  The only problem is the lack of confession between Mal and Enora!  Those two are like nervous high school kids sometimes, which can make the show more comical, but come on! Grow a pair, Mal!
B0086700CM|5.0|it is one of the best gamed I have ever played in my life it is just sooo adicting YOU WILL. LOVE. IT
B00723NWJE|4.0|I enjoyed this effort by Norah. Kind of a departure for her and she's trying different flavors. It's great watching her grow as an artist and I'm sure some these songs reflect some issues she's been through in her life. I bought the 2LP, 180g vinyl version of Little Broken Hearts and it's nicely packaged. The vinyl itself is solid white and looks almost pearl like. A full sized poster is included of the album cover. Analog Productions is releasing vinyl and SACD boxsets of Norah's catalog soon for the purists. Vinyl box will be available July 24th and the SACD box is coming in September. Remastered by Kevin Gray.
B001ER4CNY|5.0|I ordedthis series because i loved to sit down with my mother when i was younger and watch this show. The dvd packaging is a really good idea (shaped as Jeannie's bottle). To my suprise when they showed this on tv i still didn't see all of the episodes so some of them gave me a great suprise. If you like Bewitched then you will love I Dream Of Jeannie.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a fast paced and fun game that almost everyone will enjoy. I have been looking for a game like temple tin for a long time.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The ads are okay but sometimes it can get on your nerves. The game is overall good, but some games can be lame. It is a good way to waste some time.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This series is incredible.  You are hungry for more each day! I was so sad for it to end!!!<br />when this becomes a movie, it will hands down be a block buster!!!<br />You wont regret the purchase.
B0086700CM|4.0|Very addictive game, can't seem to be able to put it down.<br />If you have a few minutes to spare, this game will give you lots of fun. It is not meant to be played for hours on end.
B0086700CM|5.0|I am so glad temple run came out for the kindle i have been waitindg so long and now we can get ig ya.
B0086700CM|5.0|its not the makers' fault that y'all get bored or frustrated fast. you just have problems. plain and simple. I love the app and everyone at my school plays it- its awesome and addicting
1439181780|5.0|The book is uplifting and inspirational. I could read it through in a day . . . but I want to savor every word and am reading only a few pages at a time.
B000SEIBB8|5.0|This was my only and best aquisition in IT and is really important to have it for reference.<br />I totally recommend it!
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is very easy to play, and while it does seem somewhat repetitive, the fact that the level is different every time along with the ability to earn powerups and what not keep me coming back. Would definitely recommend!

0765316994|4.0|The philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre once said, on the meaning of life, \\"Man is nothing else but what he makes of himself.\\" Frederich Nietzche said, \\"If we possess a why of life, we can put up with almost any how.\\" And Stephen King wrote, \\"Life sucks, then you die.\\"<br /><br />It'll take a far better philosopher than I to really look at this book from an existentialist viewpoint, but I strongly suspect that it would be a lot of fun to do. After all, one of the major questions that philosophy - and existentialism in particular - tries to address is that of why we are here. What is our purpose in life? What, in the end, does it all mean? For us out here, that's a question we can't really know the answer to, and thus a whole branch of philosophy exists to tell us that it doesn't really matter. That maybe we don't have a purpose imposed upon us from outside, but that's okay. We can create our own. We can contribute our own verses to the powerful play of life, as Whitman would have it, and in the end we are responsible for our own lives.<br /><br />But what if we weren't? What if there was a being that orchestrated our lives, willing them into - and more importantly out of - existence? What would you do with the realization that your life is not entirely your own? And even worse, the realization that the person in control of it doesn't really care all that much about you?<br /><br />That is the problem faced by Ensign Andrew Dahl of the Universal Union flagship Intrepid. It is the 25th century, and things couldn't be better. He has a chance to see new world and new civilizations, to boldly go... Well, you know the rest. Dahl is at the frontier of science and exploration, and is determined to make the most of it.<br /><br />If he survives.<br /><br />Alone among the ships of the UU, the Intrepid loses crew at an alarming rate. Dahl soon discovers a fact that has been known for years by those crew members who are bright enough to spot the pattern: people who go on away missions with the command staff will, almost inevitably, die. Toxic gasses, killer machines, Borgovian land worms - these are just a tiny sampling of dangers that have done in ensigns and miscellaneous crew for years, and no one seems to know why. All they can do is make sure they're not in the room when the Captain comes in, looking for someone who pop down to a planet's surface to find out why that mining colony hasn't reported in recently.<br /><br />Dahl, of course, just can't let himself and his friends die, so he begins digging into the true nature of their lives on the starship Intrepid. What he discovers is a truth almost too mad to be believed: their lives are not their own. A greater power is directing events on the Intrepid, dictating who lives and who dies, and that greater power doesn't seem to be very good at what it does. So Dahl and his friends have to bet everything on the power of the Narrative, meet their makers and try to find a way to secure their freedom. Or, failing that, a way to see to it that their lives have more meaning than they had before.<br /><br />As always with John Scalzi, I recommend picking this up. It's a very fast read - I finished it in under a day - and it has the tight combination of humor, thoughtfulness, and genuine emotion that I have come to expect from his work. From a premise that is incredibly simple - \\"The crew of a starship realize they're doomed if they go on away missions and try to change their fate\\" - he's built up a multi-layered exploration into the meaning of life and death. The universe he's given to us is one where people are denied the ability to give meaning to their own lives, and have to rely one an unseen force to do it for them. The fight, then, is to acquire that ability to decide. To gain agency, as it were. They want to be able to control their own existence so badly that they risk their existence entirely.<br /><br />The corollary, then, is very simple: what are you doing with your life? We, the readers,have that agency. We can make decisions for our own lives and our own purposes. If we succeed or fail, we can do so knowing that we made those successes or failures possible. [1] In a sense, we don't know how good we have it, something that is brought up in the second of three codas to the main novel. We can choose. We can create meaning in our lives without hoping that some higher power will do it for us. So why don't we?<br /><br />For a book that presents itself as a quick, fun read, there are certainly layers upon layers of meaning in it that could be a lot of fun to explore. The only complaint, really, is that it wasn't long enough. And I don't mean that he skipped essential scenes, or that he should have opted for a Tolkien/Jordan/Martin-esque style of describing every goddamn thing that showed up on the page, but there were points where I just wanted him to slow down a bit and let us appreciate the moments for what they were. There's a scene in chapter 21, for example, that should be really emotional and meaningful, but it's almost entirely dialogue. Good dialogue, yes, but I wanted to linger over it a bit, and that's true for a lot of scenes in the book. Scalzi writes wonderful banter, and makes his characters sound real, but I want to see things as well as hear them.<br /><br />Also, to be honest, I expected the last page to just be a picture of Scalzi at his computer, turning to the camera and winking. It would have been hilariously meta, but I guess he's not as gimmicky as that.<br /><br />Buy the book and enjoy it. If you're a fan of Star Trek - which was, given the title, a huge inspiration for the story - you'll no doubt appreciate it more than most. Even if you haven't watched every episode of the original series, though, the Red Shirt character is one that has permeated all levels of fiction, and has died many times in order to advance the plots that you love so well. He even has one poor guy who's not only a Red Shirt, but nearly at the end of histour and about to get married. There was no way he'd survive. Take some time out for these poor, expendable bastards and give them a chance to shine.<br /><br />----<br />\\"The [Borgovian Land Worms] were in a frenzy. Somebody was now likely to die. It was likely to be ensign Davis.\\"<br />- from \\"Redshirts\\" by John Scalzi<br />----<br />[1] There are plenty of external, uncontrollable factors, of course, which can all be lumped together under the term \\"luck,\\" but you know what I mean.

0345803485|5.0|I have never sat down and actually read a whole book in my life, even in High school I would just skim through books to find the right answer. Until I was introduced to Fifty Shades of Grey by my best friend. She described it to me and I thought it sounded pretty interesting, so I figured what the heck and I ordered it that night. I received it within a few days. At first it went a little slow, but once I got to chapter 4 I couldn't put it down. I read over 70% of the book in just one day. I was in love with the story and the way it made me feel. I found myself being nicer to my husband which ended up paying off for both of us:) It has been about a month and I just finished the final book. They were amazing and it makes me sad that I am done with them. Now I can't wait for the movie to come out. I will be counting down the days!!
0765326353|5.0|There are times when I hate having grown up to be a fantasy fan. Most of the time it's when I pick up a book that seems promising - maybe because it's from a familiar author, or because you heard from a friend of a friend that it was good - but it turns out to be disappointing. Stock characters, old and tired plotlines, and a world that's basically Tolkien with some greasepaint and false noses added on. Given the number of people who write fantasy, the odds of coming across a truly interesting world with compelling characters and a story that has some surprises is difficult indeed.<br /><br />Fortunately, it looks like Sanderson has managed to pull it off.<br /><br />The world of Roshar is a strange and tempestuous place. The seasons come and go in unpredictable ways, sometimes bringing with them great highstorms that are so powerful that even the plants of this world have evolved ways to hide from them. It is a world filled with spirits, ubiquitous beings called spren, which pop up for almost any reason. There are the spren of nature - windspren, firespren, rotspren, riverspren and the like. There are spren that seem attracted to humans, like alespren, gloryspren, anticipationspren and logicspren. No one really knows what they are or why they exist, but they are everywhere in this world.<br /><br />The greatest kingdom in Roshar is that of Alethkar, which is barely a nation at all. A loosely bound alliance of ten high princes, the people of Alethkar are a hostile, ambitious, violent folk whose first and greatest love is battle and winning. Since the assassination of their king by the savage Parshendi, they have been involved in a seemingly endless siege of revenge on the great Shattered Plains.<br /><br />The greatest warriors of Alethkar - or any nation - are those who wield the amazing shardblades. Swords that seem to condense out of mist, the shardblades can cut through anything, though if they cut through a person their effects are a little more subtle. A warrior armed with a shardblade, wearing shardplate armor, can use the incredible power of stormlight to achieve feats that no normal man could survive. Bound within glowing gemstones and restored by the howling winds of the highstorms, stormlight is Roshar's greatest treasure.<br /><br />Within this world we follow an ensemble cast which, while adhering to certain fantasy archetypes, still is made interesting and worth watching. Dalinar, the brother to the dead Alethi king, is searching for a way to hold together the weak nation that his brother formed. He has been learning of the old ways, the teachings of the vanished and reviled Knights Radiant, in the hopes that they can help hold his people together.<br /><br />On the other end of Alethi society is Kaladin. Once a promising young surgeon, Kaladin joined the army in hopes of being able to fight on the Shattered Plains. He made it there, but not as a soldier - as a member of a bridge crew, one of the most expendable resources in the entire war. He became the lowest of the low, forced to find a reason to stay alive.<br /><br />In a city far from the fighting, young Shallan Davar has fought to become the ward of the great heretic scholar Jasnah Kholin. While she has ostensibly come to learn from the woman, her true purpose is to steal Jasnah's soulcaster, a device which, if used properly, can turn something into something else - stone into smoke, glass into blood, a man into fire. With this, Shallan hopes to revive her family's flagging fortunes after the death of her father. What she discovers with Jasnah, of course, is far, far more.<br /><br />Then there's Szeth-son-son-Vallano, truthless of Shinovar. Poor, poor Szeth. From a race of people known for their peaceful and easygoing natures, Szeth is the most powerful assassin the world has seen. He can harness the stormlight to manipulate gravity, making him able to do the impossible while he uses his shardblade to cut down anyone in his way. In truth, though, Szeth wishes only one thing - to find someone who is good enough to kill him, and end his tormented life.<br /><br />As you may have guessed, it's a complicated tale, and Sanderson doesn't hold to this whole \\"Give the reader time to get used to it\\" style of writing. If you're not paying attention from the beginning, you are likely to be very, very lost within the first chapter or so. But once everything settles down, the story turns into a fast-paced, multi-leveled adventure that takes place in a world that is imaginative and fascinating.<br /><br />The characters are enthralling, too, with many levels and - most importantly - flaws. While Kaladin is a brilliant organizer and leader, he has to fight continually against the despair of realizing what his life has come to. The easy thing would be to allow himself to die, but he knows he can't let himself do that. Dalinar, plagued by visions of what might be Roshar's ancient past, is fighting centuries of Alethi martial tradition by trying to bring the high princes together and end the war, rather than allowing it to go on. He's pulled between the love of his nephew, the king, and his frustration that the king won't be strong enough to do what needs doing. Shallan, who left her home with a clear purpose, is finding that nothing was what she thought it would be. Jasnah isn't an evil woman, despite being a heretic, and her plan to steal the soulcaster becomes less and less certain the more she learns.<br /><br />All of these characters are at the front edge of thousands of years of history, much of it shrouded in uncertainty - legendary Knights Radiant who fought Voidbringers before giving up their duty and turning against mankind. What actually happened is unknown, and perhaps won't ever be known. But the effects of those events echo to the present day, causing problems which our characters will eventually have to deal with.<br /><br />Perhaps the greatest compliment I can give to Sanderson is that when I finished the book, I immediately went back to the first page and started reading again. There are very few books that have inspired me thus, but this one did - especially after the cascading Big Reveals at the end, which explain a lot, and cast a new light on a whole lot more.<br /><br />What's more, I found myself wishing that I had access to an animation studio while I read the action scenes. Fights can be hard to do in written form - there's a tendency to either describe too much or too little, and very often the reader gets slowed down trying to visualize what's happening in the story. Sanderson is very, very good at writing action, something I first noticed in Towers of Midnight. Even when Szeth is hopping from floor to ceiling to wall, flinging people around like toys, the action was very clear in my mind's eye, and it's something I would love to see animated, if not done in live action.<br /><br />And yes, to get back to why I hate being a fantasy reader sometimes, it is the first book in a series, which means I'm likely to be following it for quite some time. There's nothing truly wrong with that - there are plenty of series that I've followed in my day - but I never look forward to the waiting game that you have to play as the author works on the next book. To be fair, though, Sanderson is busy right now finishing up my favorite series, The Wheel of Time, so I think I can give him a little latitude.<br /><br />In any case, if you're looking for a dense, fun new series to read, definitely pick this up. I plan on getting into some of his other books, mainly in order to have something to do while I wait for the next one of these.<br /><br />--------------------------------------<br /><br />\\"The purpose of a storyteller is not to tell you how to think, but to give you questions to think upon.

B006UG90RM|3.0|The sales assistant said this hadn't exactly been flying off the shelves. But hey, the name Van Halen still commands a heck of a lot of respect in the hard rock/classic rock world so who cares about that? This 2012 album by one of the great North American hard rock institutions certainly came with a mountain of expectation, classic rock magazine for example timing major league Halen stories for around its release. And with a bonus DVD thrown into the bargain alongside the thirteen tracks on the album proper you are gettin' your monies worth.<br /><br />Or are you? Tattoo has chutzpah aplenty with Diamond Dave injecting all that stagecraft and personality into a fun little number that nevertheless contrives to sound second rate and with its talk of dragon tattoos smacks a little of desperation at trying to sound relevant to the time of its release. The album scoots on down the road desperately wanting to be a good time drive time listen but so many of the tunes aren't bullseyes. They hit the target for the most part but to use boxing parlance there are no knockout blows delivered. It's all sparring and footwork as if the band think that by being super sprightly and bower bird like we'll forgive the lack of bollocks. Certainly a lot of the tunes such as She's the Woman dance about a lot and Eddie Van Halen is as ever a joy to hear but in some ways a lot of these numbers are too busy. It's made all the more tragic when the heft of China Town kicks in with its racing rhythm attack and guitar heft intro shows you that this band can still cut it - a few more tunes like this would have made the album a nice blend of hard hitting rock and elder statesmen of classic rock chillin' out styles.<br /><br />The production on this album has come in for a pasting by some reviewers and I have to say I agree with the arguments against some modern styles of production but I don't feel it's that bad here. The full style of the booklet is nice - it's not like their record company can't afford decent product presentation - but what made this release a three stars for me (only two w/out it I'm afraid) was the bonus DVD. The songs presented on the DVD are in a convivial atmosphere of smiles all round and show a way the mighty Van Halen could have elected to attack the modern market. Stripping back and doing the acoustic thing has worked for others and the sprightly arrangements and sheer fun factor of seeing a couple of hard rockin' legends in a laid back manner may have worked it's magic for them had they gone down the path of reworking their old classics.<br /><br />Still, artistic integrity `n' all it's easy enough to see why they wanted to put out the album they have. And it's not really fair to have a very high `minimum standard' just because of who this band is - then again perhaps it is fair to measure them via the sort of yardstick only legends should be measured against.<br /><br />Not without gems within its wending ways but not exactly a stellar addition to the Van Halen canon.<br /><br />P.S - now just to await the negative votes by the acolytes....afford decent product presentation - but what made this release a three stars for me (only two w/out it I'm afraid) was the bonus DVD.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|It's amazing to have a Rush album of this quality in the year 2012.  They have somehow mixed most of the aspects (sans some of the keyboards of the eighties) of their long history into one wonderful album.  These guys were a positive influence in my life when I was a teenager, it's awesome to hear them at this high level again. Geddy's bass playing and tone are truly astounding, an all time great in-studio performance including any genre of music. Great stuff.
B00846F1YW|2.0|boring boring boring. not very entertaining and has to much of a story line constantly talking and not playing the game.
B000F8DB4O|5.0|I am a consummate, ultimate metheny fan.  At first, i felt this album was not natural (you know,pure instrumental music).  This album mesmerizes me day in, year out.There is Lyle's great piano artistry, along with the possibly not so natural drum section, and then Pat's unmistakable synth.  I absolutely love 'End of the World', to the point i'm hypnotized.  But all the other tunes are great.  It will stand the test of time ... it's timeless.
B0063GORYU|4.0|very entertaining. plays is similar to the windows version. it remembers where you left off so you can continue from where you left off. recommended
B007D2XSW0|3.0|Subject being said, Amazon placed an application as the free app of the day instead of a game.  How refreshing is that?!<br /><br />PicShop is a pretty flat offering to a bloated app segment (photo editing).  There's Vignette, Instagram, and Lightbox to name a few I use. If you're looking at this as an option, look at the others. If you are looking for an alternate, try using your native camera and then passing that photo through Instagram and Lightbox.<br /><br />If you want to take great photos, put your phone down. Want to share 'em? Scan and upload to FB. If you are proud of a photo, don't manipulate it.

B006FO3ERQ|5.0|This novel had a very disturbing effect on me. The chapters are short and I feel that the story was very fast-paced but jam-packed with exciting and nerve-shattering twists and turns on the plot. The hero of the story has a very dramatic life that is creatively described in the story. Fascinating how he was able to get out of it all.

As obviously brilliant and insightful as the author is about the mind of men and women, SURELY she could have come up with a twist in the end to not leave you feeling like you need a shower to wash it off of you.

0783231032|2.0|Steven Spielberg's 1979 film \\"1941\\" takes place only a week after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.  World War II has arrived on American shores and California is in a panic with expectations that a Japanese attack is imminent.  This movie could have a been a lot of fun. Heck, Spielberg had a wonderful cast to work with but he just blows it is endless scenes of the characters acting totally idiotic and yelling at each other.  There is a LOT of yelling.  It is so annoying.  This film could have been hilarious but Spielberg goes the route of a total goofball comedy, and a very unfunny one at that, and he's not very good with the comedy chops here with this movie.  \\"1941\\" is very long and very much a big disappointment.
B0086213XW|3.0|Margo (Michelle WIlliams) meets Daniel (Luke Kirby) on a Colonial tour, in which actors are put in stocks and whipped for committing adultery.  This bit of foreshadowing (Daniel goads her into administering the lashing) is a clue as to the moral dilemma that involves Margo, Daniel, and ultimately Margo's husband, Lou (Seth Rogan).<br /><br />The theme of marriage, temptation, boredom and adultery is hardly new fodder for exploration, but it does have an endless fascination.  This tale of hipster attraction, lust and flirtation does not add anything particularly intriguing to the mix.  Michelle Williams does a good job with the complicated character of Margo, who seems literally lost in her own neuroses and insecurities.  She swings from childlike timidity to really bold flirting without much in between, and the instant hot attraction between she and Daniel leaves her understandably emotional and highly charged.  Daniel, it turns out, lives right across the street from Margo and Luke (how did they not know this?) and he also veers from boldness - he literally stalks her 24/7 -- to suddenly turning morally righteous just as he's about to get what he wants.  These two tease each other in a way that I found infuriating.  Of course, they say and do things that real people operating under the conventions of civility would never say or do, but when it comes to pulling the trigger, they both back off.<br /><br />Most puzzling to me was the character of Luke (Seth Rogan), Margo's husband.  A writer of cookbooks involving chicken, he is a charming manchild with a strange distaste for touching his pretty wife.  She, clearly in love with him, tries on countless occasions to \\"seduce\\" him (her words), only to be spurned with no explanation each and every time.  They behave towards each other like kindergarten children with a crush.  They \\"play\\" with each, tickle each other, he dumps cold water on her in her shower (why???) but he will not sleep with her.  Is he gay?  Asexual?  At one point he mutters something about \\"not deserving her\\" which does nothing to clarify the situation.<br /><br />My favorite performance in the movie was that of Sarah Silverman.  She seems natural, is her usual bold, profane self, and adds a dimension of reality to a movie which is so subtle and nuanced it gets in its own way.  \\"Everything new gets old\\" is hardly a startling new revelation, and unfortunately, this treatment of that theme ultimately fails to satisfy.one point he mutters something about \\"not deserving her\\" which does nothing to clarify the situation.<br /><br />My favorite performance in the movie was that of Sarah Silverman.

B0072IVGZG|3.0|The Cult's new album \\"Choice of Weapon\\" opens with a great track called \\"Honey From A Knife\\". It got that classic Cult rawk sound and has a great chorus that gets in your head and stays there.  Too bad the rest of the album is just mediocre.  There are rock tracks interspersed with slower, moodier tracks and it all just kind of blends together.  Not a very memorable album by The Cult.  Now, if all of the tracks were all as good as the opening track then this album would have been something special.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This triology is about more than the sex, it is one of the best love stories I have ever read.  Well written.  I couldn't believe these were her first books.  I recommend them to everyone.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Set in the countryside, I initially thought this book was boring for a suspense story until I read its first two chapters. The slow pacing was quite necessary to develop the brilliant and strong plot. It did not make the story dragging instead it enhanced the novel even more. The characters were equally unforgettable so I'd say this is unique, creative and a worthy read.
B0063IH60K|4.0|this is a pretty fun game. i love playing solitaire, so finding this was great. you really get what you pay for, seeing as this app is free. it's a fun game, but the ads are a little excessive. if you like solitaire, this is a great game to get. :)
B00319ECC4|5.0|Wow.  I had pretty much written off Fear Factory after guitarist Dino Cazares left the band.  The band carried on and it seemed rather pointless because the music wasn't near as good and interesting.  Here comes Dino back into the fold and the band releases \\"Mechanize\\" which is one of the best albums of the band's career.  This album is what you would expect from Fear Factory based on its glory days when Dino was guitarist.  Its very brutal, fast, aggressive, and angry as hell.  Talk about a dog that has regained its bark AND bite.  I thought that mutt was near toothless by now.  You know how a lot of bands that were once great reunite with original members after a long time and they promise to be as good as they were when they were good.  You go out to buy the new reunion album and it just sound like a wimpier, middle-aged version of the old stuff.  Lot of bands have done that over the years. I am sure you know what I mean.  Not these boys!  The best thing is I never expected this album to be near this good.  You will not be disappointed!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I only started to read this series of books because of the publicity.  I was hooked!  I fell in love with the characters.  I felt like I needed to protect the girl, not knowing what was going to happen next!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun to kill time<br />when<br />you are bored and have nothing to do.I liked this game for my kindle fire

0525478817|4.0|Having written a YA teen cancer/romance story, I was a bit nervous about this book. I was afraid it would hold all the secrets my own story contained. Upon finally cracking the story open, I was relieved to find that The Fault in Our Stars is not A Place In This Life... but something else entirely and very good. Hazel and Augustus are two kids with terminal cancer (at first Augustus seems totally cured, having endured amputation of his leg due to osteosarcoma) who meet in support group. They click almost instantly and with a charm and wit unlike any other teen couple I've read in recent years.<br /><br />They are also extremely mature with their language and dialogue, which I find unrealistic. However, there are kids (and adults) out there who use complex language more freely than others (think Frasier Crane), and Hazel and Augustus are in this realm. Once I got over the mature dialogue, I saw that John Green was able to weave a story around the friends and lovers that also involved cancer. At times I forgot that the kids were suffering, and that is wonderful because when you have a disease, be it cancer or something autoimmune or neurological, your life shouldn't be the disease. You still have to live. Hazel and Augustus do this.<br /><br />While many readers of this book cried, I did not. Perhaps it is because I've experienced the horrors of cancer in my family and in my own life (thought I had thyroid cancer several years ago, which is what Hazel had). Not sure why I didn't cry. Maybe I am numb?<br /><br />My only other qualm with this book is the ending. It felt stunted and unsatisfying. Now, I realize that with books pertaining to characters with cancer that the outcomes are often dismal and sad at best, and that is conveyed in this book. However, I would have envisioned a different ending. Maybe it's just me.<br /><br />Overall, this book was an easy read because it flowed to perfection. I enjoyed it immensely and will seek out more of Green's books in the future.ure.
B00785P2QC|1.0|a great game and fun to play. also fun to play when bored. so much fun. create your own city
B005K17RU0|5.0|I think this app is great for looking at my local weather. I have it so my local weather loads when I press on it. It gives you weather forcast for the day, hour, extended forcast, and radar. It may have a few other features I don't use. It works for what I use it for.
B0055QYKQO|5.0|So far the board is working great.. I replaced the thermal paste on the NSB with arctic silver since it is just a standard heatsink and I have had no overheating problems. Overclocking is extremely easy. Only gripe is that there is no IDE drive support for older hard drives/dvd drives. Unlike a lot of the reviewers, I really like having the SATA ports in a vertical orientation. My case lets you route the wires behind the motherboard and these connectors make it extremely easy to hide the sata cables. But again with no IDE, only 6 sata connectors will go fast.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this app has been so much fun for the whole family!<br />I teach the kids how to save their money to reach their goals and they enjoy buying all the animals.
B005LAIHZY|2.0|The animation was gorgeous, the music was haunting, and the humor was fabulous. The problem was the story. I do realize we're talking about Disney here, but C'mon, this was primitive and primeval even for the Magic Kingdom.<br /><br />I'll sum up the story (SPOILER ALERT):<br /><br />A rebellious girl is being forced to succumb to an arranged marriage so that her clan can remain allies with the other clans. She doesn't like it and rebels. What happens to girls who refuse to be treated like chattel? Why, their mothers get turned into bears, of course. Fitting punishment, and an excellent message to send to your daughters. And who facilitates the transformation of the mother into a mean and horrible beast, by the way? A \\"witch\\" of course: an old woman living in the forest. The vapidity of that stereotype didn't stop Disney from once again using it shamelessly.<br /><br />So, how can this rebel princess straighten up and save her mother? By sewing.<br /><br />I am not kidding.<br /><br />By mending with a needle and thread a split she made in a tapestry. You know, by finally acting like a PROPER girl.<br />Then her mother is transformed back into her old self, and the men who otherwise might have been GIVEN the girl as a prize, now have agreed to court her until she loves and picks one of them (a flippant and insincere nod to women's rights). I'm sure she'll also be occasionally allowed to continue riding her horse and loosing her arrows at prescribed targets...that is, until she finally agrees to do her duty and marries one of the losers from which she has to pick. Ah, all is well.<br /><br />Gimme a break.<br /><br />I had hoped that Disney would finally have come up with a REAL heroine for a story, but instead it's just another thinly-veiled lesson in Christian patriarchy and female obedience.<br /><br />2 stars for the positive points (animation, music, humor, scenery, imagination), and I certainly won't keep my daughter from watching it, but we're going to have atalk first about forced marriage and reasonable gender roles, and whether or not being old and living alone actually means a woman is evil and dishonest.
B0085P2Z6E|1.0|This is extremely idiotic. Even the castle itself is taken from HP! Plus (or more fittingly minus) the plot is stolen off of the last few chapters of the Chamber of Secrets except twisted to seem more childish and playable on an app. And then ruining it to an even greater extent by adding &quot;search-and-finds&quot;.  T This was a complete waste of money.
B0084RSYEK|5.0|Eddie Murphy was once one of the funniest actors in hollywood, but thing have changed.  This movie will not win any awards, but is a good family movie to watch, that was much better than expected.
B0034G4P80|5.0|Love this movie!  The DVD came within a few days of ordering- which was awesome! This was definitely a great buy!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I'm not sure why everyone is having such issues. I just installed and all works well on my Samsung Galaxy S (Epic 4G) with CM9/ICS. For what I paid I have no complaints. editing is easy to do and reasonably responsive even on my old hacked phone running a beta OS.
B000N2HCM4|2.0|President Obama was my choice for President even though I am a Republican.  I wanted to live long enough to see a black president.  He seemed like a great guy, well spoken and a chance for change.  Maybe some day he will be ready but he was not ready to be President when elected.  Now that I have read this book, I understand him and his experiences in life or lack thereof.  He is so puffed up, so arrogant. He lived an unusual life from the time he was born.  It is hard to believe he is just as much white as black.  His choice of friends and life style i.e. drugs, are the real Obama.  The facade that got him elected is created but not to be believed.  I am glad I read this book.  I cannot vote for him again.  I still hope I live long enough to see a great, first full black president!
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Ton of fun! Good to spend time between classes or a couple hours playing courses. I would recommended this for anyone.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is amazing. Its not your typical love story and I love that its not. Mr Grey and Anastasia are two very different people coming together through lust and one hell of a story. Loved this trilogy
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Great book and series. Recommend ordering all 3 books at once cause you will read them all. Great storyline, couldn't stop reading!!!
B005K17RU0|4.0|pretty accurate maps and weather predictions.  looks great on the Kindle Fire.  cool maps and radar projections.  quick responses and updates.  I like how it runs constantly in the background
B007ZRZF8I|3.0|when I bought this game the first thing I noticed was a bar at the bottom that said:openfeint requires a active network connection. but surprisingly they did not say that openfeint was in here! on top of openfeint the app has in app purchasing which in this game, is not required but helps you greatly. they give you 10 free powerups but after you use them up then you will have to pay 99&cent; for 5 more if you want some. but the game itself is very fun and I do still play it some.<br /><br />hint: save your powerups. and if you have used them all up, then delete the game and reinstall it. (it doesn't save your progress though but if you don't mind that then do it.)
B0065GC0BA|5.0|What a beautiful, moving story.. This book changed my outlook on the subject matter and stayed in my heart and mind for weeks after I finished it. A must-read!
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|You don't have to like old-Pop or new-Pop or anybody's Pop.  The music Adam Lambert creates soars above all the lazy labels from the media.  Been trying for weeks now to choose a favorite.  Maybe Runnin' (You need the DELUXE version for that one--well worth it for 3 extra also-great tracks.)<br /><br />If you have a long commute, HIGHLY recommend you plug in to Trespassing.  Adam's energy takes over and the time flies.  Only downside is the disappointment when you arrive and must unplug.  But take heart, you still have the commute home!<br /><br />Adam Lambert is an extraordinary artist.  You'll be doing yourself and the oftentimes sad World a favor when you buy this Album.  He brings joy, compassion and understanding to so many of the human miseries through his music.<br /><br />Sure I'm a Glambert, have been from the beginning.  But I'm also a grandmother, a professional, and a music-hound who loves opera. If you love music, don't miss out on Adam Lambert. Catch his 4:26 minute version of Brigadoon on UTube and prepare to stop breathing for the beauty of it all. Roam his acoustic music and prepare to cry. Then be sure to come back here and buy Trespassing for the glory of it all.  PS  First Amazon Review I've ever bothered to leave. This album and this artist ... well you can see all the reviews here.  Believe and Buy!
B002RKSCA6|4.0|i read this book for an english project. i highly recommend switching reading between a paper copy for on the go and digital for when ur waiting for face book to load. good book fairly short.

B003X897D2|1.0|I don't like modern Jazz much but seeing how this was one of those 'ultimate' records and $1.99 I thought I would try it. The sax is boring and monotonous, the drumming simplistic and dull, this record confirms my prejudices about modern jazz, elevator music. Furthermore the production seems horribly separated, I imagine this was originally mono but now all the sax is in one ear and the rest in the other, doesn't sound good (it's not my gear, I checked).<br /><br />In case you wonder, I like a wide range of music, trad jazz, classical, blues, modern country, rock of many kinds, some reggae, no rap though...
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is an awesome book. I will read it again and again. the whole set is worth reading and I recommend everyone to read.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I have nothing else much to add, except it reminds me a bit of Presto, which is a GOOD thing.<br />I was not a fan of S&A, and I feared Rush would continue in that direction.<br />I'm so glad they didn't.
B007IE4DTU|5.0|Thank you Martin for getting around to making this film about one of the most eclectic and caring \\"superstars\\" of our generation. The film is not the boring documentary you would see on the History Chanel (sorry guys,but most of them are). His life is shared with us through his vast network of friends and family, from Eric Clapton to Jackie Stewart. And of course his words and Music. I think the sorted parts of his life are covered a bit shallowly but not glossed over. This is not a Beatles Bio, although Paul and Ringo give their memories. Georges innate generosity and devotion to family and the mastering of more than one discipline has certainly given my attitude and guitar playing a boost.<br />KSKanne
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I could not put this book down. It was great to read. I will read it over and over. Read all three books, it is worth it.
0810970686|5.0|I love this series of Diary of a Wimpy Kid. I like the fact that it's in a hardcover. It came quickly in my mail. However this book isn't as funny as the previous one, but still worth buying.
B0085776BG|2.0|The dialogue in this movie is horrible.  Guys taunting each other during combat, pilots saying \\"they're just toying\\" with a German fighter shooting at him from behind, and and a bunch of other nonsese make this such an unrealistic story.<br /><br />The old style WWII movies that use actual airplanes and fotage are gone.  What we have now are computerized versions.<br />In this movie, when the B 17's begin drop their bombs, they hold steady altitude.  That's because they're computerized.  In WWII, when bombers dropped their bombs, they would suddenly gain altitude after losing the weight of the bombs (look at any old actual fotage to see for yourself).<br /><br />I was glad to see another movie based on airplane combat about WWII made.  But these days, movies are so unrealistic and Hollywood garbage.  Compare the part in this movie where the Tuskegee airmen attack a German airbase and the scene where the Japanese attack an American airbase in Pearl Harbor in the movie Tora, Tora, Tora! and tell me we're going backwards or forward in movie quality with action scenes.  Nowadays, large explosions are what make for action scenes.<br /><br />At least the Tuskege airmen were honored, and remembered.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|Epic!  This was the best book I've read in a long, long time.  It's funny and if you're familiar with Star Trek it's even better.  You become so invested in the characters that you're on the edge of your seat with every twist and turn.  I finished this book in a few hours because I couldn't put it down!<br /><br />Rating:  A+
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Once I started volume one I was totally  hooked. As soon as I finished each book I couldn't wait to start the next. It was great!!!
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|Nice graphics and easy to follow. It is nice for passing the time and simple to figure out. Not highly challenging, but worth the money.
0345803485|2.0|I got this book because everyone was talking about it and it didn't live up to the hype. It's incohesive and simply written. It almost comes off as if it were written by a child. If you need a quick cheesy read then this is the book for you. But if you are looking for substance stay clear of this one.

B007VTVGFQ|5.0|An event Fiona diehards have grown used to, another album has finally been released.  We only had to wait a bit more than half a decade; but for someone who fought her record company (Sony....no small feat) in order to finally release \\"Extraordinary Machine,\\" nothing Fiona Apple does comes as any great surprise.<br /><br />When Apple exploded on the scene in the mid-nineties with a superb offering, \\"Tidal,\\" many felt they were in the direct line of fire of slaughter by brilliance.  They were halfway right:  While there is no denying the brilliance of Fiona Apple, her offerings have been sparce, highly-anticipated and....eventually, realized.  And so we have \\"The Idler Wheel.............\\"<br /><br />Rather than analyze each song, I will leave it at this:  If you are an Apple fan, buy it and check your area for her tour.  For the virgin, this might be a good place to start, although I don't know if Ms. Apple will EVER be able to best her effort that was \\"When the Pawn..........\\" It just might always be wise to start at the beginning.  On the other hand, if this is your first experience, listen and worry about the preceding efforts at a later time.<br /><br />When you listen to this album and the three that preceded, you are immediately aware of the smoky voice that is, indirectly, seducing you to search with her.  It's not hard to hear that Apple is influenced by the likes of the Sarah Vaughan, Dinah Washington and, to a lesser sense, the heroin-laced syrup that made Billie Holiday an icon, deserved or not.<br /><br />Fiona Apple, like a fine, single-malt scotch, is an acquired taste.  There is no commercialism evident, nor is her music tied to simple meter.  In other words, listening to Fiona Apple, while not requiring any formal music background, is a challenge that, for most, requires preparation.  However, her devoted group of fans cannot help but be delighted by \\"The Idler Wheel.....\\"  What we are listening to is a phenomenon that could just as easily be performing in Minton's, New York City, circa 1940-50.  That's how I prefer to think of her.<br /><br />If you decide to take the leap of faith, trust me and buy \\"When The Pawn.....\\" first.  Listen to it and decide whether you want to hear more.  If so, \\"The Idler Wheel....\\" will suit you just fine.  Just don't forget that \\"Tidal\\" and \\"Extraordinary Machine\\" are also begging for a listen
B005LAIGLO|4.0|This was a pretty good movie with a great plot and an even better cast. It kept my attention throughout. Great for home entertainment.

B007D2XSW0|4.0|This app is pretty good. I don't think it is worth 5 dollars though. But I still like it better than what I had before.
B00785P2QC|5.0|The game is free. And you don't need Internet connection. That's the best part! If you cant memorize all of the rules of the game it guides you. Over night you get about 70000 coins. If you have a lot of buildings. So I hope you enjoy the game too! I think 5 star is the best choice! CAUSE I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />!!!!!!!!!!!&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Great app. Very similar to autodesk's photo editor, but a little more simplified. Basic editing controls. Quick. Well made. I like the ability to sketch.
B008ALA6DW|4.0|I am using the adapter on my 2011 Mac Mini as an additional network interface. I have a [[ASIN:B004GKLT4G Synology 5 bay DS1511 NAS]] with two network interfaces and I wanted to use the TB ethernet adapter to connect as a private channel to the second NAS net interface. This all works as expected. I have an SSD as my main drive in the Mac Mini and have a 5 disk raid 5 on the NAS. I set the MTU for the NAS and the TB adapter at 9000. On transfer tests for large files I am seeing 118 MB/s peak / 110 MB/s average download speeds and 112 MB/s peak / 100 MB/s average upload speeds. This in the range of what I would expect on a 1Gbps ethernet.<br /><br />I also got the adapter working booting into Windows 7 x64 with the Broadcom drivers. Similar speeds.<br /><br />Basically everything works as expected (5 stars), however (-1 star) ...<br /><br />My Mac Mini no longer stays in sleep mode. This is a known problem with this adapter - Apple's solution - don't use the adapter on the Mac Mini - use the built in ethernet port. I am not happy about this and hope Apple fixes this with software in the future. I really like having two ethernet ports but don't think I can go without the ability to put my Mac to sleep.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The worst part of my recent trip through the Wool story was having to put it down at its conclusion and not having another to pick up.<br /><br />I read the 5 part omnibus available on Kindle. I found 3 errors in format (the Kindle would add to many spaces or even a blank line at obvious unintended points). This collection places the 5 pieces into a seamless and enjoyable reading experience. The result being a pleasant volume and chapter feel that is easy to navigate with ones mind.<br /><br />I found it very easy to attach myself to the characters, both main and supporting. The plot flowed along with the sense of immense forethought.<br /><br />I will definitely take a serious look at the authors other work and anticipate the same satisfaction towards future purchases I have towards this one. (I would expect Wool would be a title in its entirety that I would like to have in hardback at a price of 27.95)

0307730697|5.0|It hasn't yet been ten minutes since I read the final page of Fearless. Normally I would wait at least a day to review a book, but this one just won't keep.<br /><br />As we approach the celebration of our nation's independence on July 4, I encourage you to read this fantastically well-written story about the life of Adam Brown, a member of Navy SEAL Team SIX. You'll meet Adam as a young boy and follow him through a dark, tumultuous period of drug addiction and prison time. His months behind bars lead him to a saving faith and put him on a new track in life. It is with jaw-dropping disbelief that you'll read of the hurdles Adam overcame to become a member of this elite group of men.<br /><br />At first I was concerned that this biography -- as most do -- would aggrandize Adam to god-like status, but  that is not at all the case. As Adam's words and deeds pointed to Christ, Blehm allows the same to happen in telling the story of Adam's life. So refreshing. So uplifting.<br /><br />You must read this book.<br /><br />*I received at ARC at no cost from the publisher, WaterBrook Press.
B007P6VLRS|2.0|As others have stated, what made the Pumpkins sound so great was the jazz style drumming of Jimmy Chamberlain mixed with the awesome multi-layered guitar riffs of Billy Corgan. Corgan does his part of the job on this album but it sadly sounds lacking without Jimmy's great drumming to complement it. The Miami Heat would never have won the NBA championship without the duo of D-Wade and Lebron James and the Pumpkins don't sound anywhere near the same without Jimmy Chamberlain.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Great game hours of fun and very addictive.  You have to like free apps.  It freezes once in a while in the higher levels.

0307279189|4.0|This book starts of a little slow focusing purely on the Tarahumara. Then the author gets scientific but in an easy to understand & enjoyable way. He talks about the causes of running injuries & the benefits of barefoot running or at least using footwear with minimal cushioning & support. If you like going out for a jog you will find a lot to like about this book. It certainly got me thinking.

B007ZKY7XO|5.0|For some weird reason, Scissor Sisters aren't the most famous and beloved band in all of the United States.  They should be!<br /><br />From the first listen, I was hooked.  I love the deluxe edition with the extra songs and mixes.  The fresh funky sound that the Sisters deliver is exactly right for listening alone, driving, parties, or working.<br /><br />I'm a middle aged married woman, and I've been a huge fan for years now.  This new album will get heavy rotation on my ipod.  This music just makes me happy.<br /><br />If you have the chance to see this band in concert, go!  I had the pleasure about 1 1/2 years ago, and they put on a fantastic show.
B005FJ7DOM|5.0|A very good vampire apocalypse movie. Very surprised about how good this movie was. There is never a dull moment. The movie sucks you in from start to finish. You find yourself in the character's shoes and going through the same obstacles they are. If you are looking for a zombie/vampire movie that isn't cheesy and very realistic Stakeland is the movie to watch. Five Stars.

B000A1SZ2Y|5.0|As my title says - a very good substitute to a high cost macro lens. I am producing high quality macros on my Panasonic GH1 camera. The converter is sturdy and well built. The converter clip-on to a camera lens is acceptable but not very secure - do yourself a favor a purchase a lens ring adapter, in my case a 52mm to 43mm.  I attach the converter to a 14mm-45mm lens and I am out there playing in seconds. Yes, it takes practice to understand what you are doing but doesn't everything? When you get your first successful macro shot - wow. What a feeling!    It get's real wild when I use my 45mm-200mm zoom lens with the converter. Remember I have a Panasonic GH1 mirrorless camera so my focal length is doubled - get's me close and personal everytime.    Take a look at my portfolio on my site <...>
B00002DE4E|3.0|I found Joy Division via my room mate who had an extensive CD collection. Until then I was unaware of the connection between New Order and JD. My initial discovery was the 'Substance' compilation album, which I still think covers their best work. I've listened to that album for 22 years and I still haven't worn it out. Within that timeframe, naturally, I checked out JD's other work and other compilations have come out. It was odd to discover that during their career the band had actually only released two albums, on EP and 5 singles for the acclaim they've garnered since Curtis's death. But let's set aside the myths and get to the heart of this.<br /><br />I was initially reluctant to give 'Closer' 3 stars. It almost feels like a betrayal, but I have to be honest. I just don't think this is the best place to start. In fact, I think it's the last place to end and it was the end of the band. From my listening I believe Joy Division really had two sides: 1. a very monotonous, repetitive droning, depressive side (e.g. Auto-Suggestion, Candidate, The Eternal) and 2. an unusual, mysterious, edgy side (e.g. Leaders of Men, Digital, No Love Lost). Both sides seemed to be given equal time from the band and can appeal to vastly different groups. I think of the monotonous side (1.) as the roots of true 'goth' music, and perhaps the least adventurous side of the band. How challenging is it to play the same slow chords for five minutes? But the other side of Joy Division (2.) is what hooked me and what I still think is where they just have no equal. Larger themes are lyrically explored, the beats are quick and steady but unobtrusive, the guitar is quasi-exotic and the bass lines frame it all, carrying the mood with bold punctuation. Some complain Ian's voice is out of tune, and yes, that's completely true. In my opinion that out of tune quality doesn't play well for slow songs as well as the fast, adventurous songs. But mind you, it's just those qualities which make it so rightfor the faster, adventurous side of Joy Division. It's disturbing and on the edge of exploding which is really what I think Joy Division is about. You could throw a pity party listening to 'Closer' whereas you could start a revolutionary terrorist group with 'An Ideal for Living'. Two completely different sides of Joy Division, perhaps for two different types of fans.<br /><br />That said, I'd love to give this album more than 3 stars but my heart is in their earlier work and compilations. If I were new Joy Division listener I would likely start with the 'Warsaw' compilation album. It doesn't get any better than that. After you've worn that out (you won't) then you might step into the moodier side of JD.

B002LANLDK|4.0|Another home run for Vin Diesel and Paul Walker. This movie starts out fast and crossing the finish line just in time to save the day. I really enjoyed this the 4th of 5 installments in the Fast & The Furious franchise. I am truely curious if they can keep up the pace in the next; \\"Fast Five.\\" I can't wait to watch and find out.[[ASIN:B002LANLDK Fast & Furious (2009)]]
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I travel a lot and need something to read until the \\"double ding\\" when I can turn on my IPad (or the inflight entertainment starts). I'd heard passing references and a glowing FB post from a friend (all from single women. Hmmmmm...) so I gave it a shot. As a Portlander I think the author should stick to locales she actually knows. And as a grown woman, I think she needs to either make the main character the 18 year old child she speaks like, or make the language about 10 years older. This book was so juvenile except for the sex scenes, about the only interesting part. The character development is shallow and unbelievable.

B0077SGMXM|5.0|I picked this up as the free app of the day, but it would be well worth the $3. I play it every day before bed. Plenty of challenges and rewards, but easy enough to succeed.  I have thoroughly enjoyed playing this simple golf game, accruing &quot;bucks&quot; without spending any money in-game.

B005LAIGF0|5.0|The 411 by Maria:<br /><br />This is an absolute must see movie. A+ cast! Stellar performances by Anna Paquin and J Smith Cameron. Paquin plays Lisa a 17 year old girl high school student and lives in Manhattan with her mother (Cameron) and brother. Smart script and dialogue about how life chews us up and spits us out.<br /><br />When Lisa sets out to find a cowboy hat, she inadvertently causes the death of a woman crossing the street.<br /><br />Guilt and frustration alters her already \\"too smart for her own good\\" youthful view of the world.  The movie takes its time and centers around complex day to day issues; death, hatred, real world events like 9/11, racial differences, teen pregnancy, drugs and divorce. Sounds like a devastating film? It isn't it is a centered, deep, thought provoking movie of the realities of the world our children are growing up in and how it affects them.<br /><br />So well done, I will be thinking about it for days.<br /><br />Anna Paquin and J. Smith Cameron along with the rest are incredible. Brilliantly acted! The scene of the bus accident is a harsh reality and Paquin will never be just Sookie to me again!<br /><br />FYI: Not a child friendly film. Nudity, harsh language and a bloody accident add to the movie and are not there for dramatic visuals.
140053271X|5.0|I'm the kind of guy that wants something to function well and that's it.  This thing is brilliant at what it does: displays ebooks.  No frills, no apps, no video, no nonsense.  Because of this it makes it very easy to use.  Download Calibre for free and this baby syncs right up with it.  Battery lasts forever, and it has the same charger as most android smart phones, so In the mornings I take my smartphone off its charger and replace it with my little nook.  I am in the military and as someone else said, this fits perfect in the side cargo pocket of my ABU's.  I had the Kobo, which was a great reader, and my wife had the last nook which I didn't like because it was so damn heavy.  I bought this for me so I could give my Kobo to my little girl.  I was able to snag one used on here from a seller named NikonLover for $47!  This thing is really great.  The only complaint I can make is that the page buttons are a little too recessed, but this is not a huge issue as I turn the pages mostly via touchscreen anyways.  Using this little beauty, and loading all of my own books, and PDF's that I have converted via Calibre, makes me beg the question: Why are people still buying Kindles?  I guess that is the same dilemma I have with Iphones.  Oh well, a fool and his money....  Buy this now!  You will not regret it!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really enjoy how easy it is to touch and move cards.<br />it is also easy to play multiplayer with the touch of a button.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|This game is simply ingenious.  I am only through the beginner levels and the variety and difficulty has been a pleasant surprise.

B007SWZVBQ|5.0|This is a great album, contains the excellent work that the cast turns out week after week and these are the best, although it should have more songs on it, at least 5 fewer than before

B0079J28NC|5.0|Right from the opening credits, \\"Yellow Submarine\\" is a classic animated film.  Good vs. evil, Pepperland, The funny Yellow Submarine,  Bluish People and recreating The Beatles down pat to how they walk the walk is something to watch.  Original widescreen ratio of 1:66:1 restored with incredible vibrant colors brings 1968 up to date.  As a movie it is a busy, multiple movement of things happening at the same time that might even blow away the young gadget crowd of present times.  Short attention is no problem on this baby.  As a video music film for what it is, \\"The Yellow Submarine\\" is a fantastic trip of 1 1/2 hours that flys by quickly.  The plot?  Who cares.  Click on the subtitles so the English words don't get lost with the strawberries and cream.  Maybe a bag of nachos, too.  It's nice to be a kid again briefly before the monday morning work alarm goes off to start another week of grind.  Take the trip. It's fun escape back to Pepperland.  Better now than 1968.  The music also in the movie fits to the tee and a cameo appearance by the Fab Four themselves at the end finishes this submarine off on a high note.  It's classic DVD for the young, old and everything in between.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|its pretty good but could use more adjustments. this app had only a few things that you could change so I gave it a four.
1607053888|4.0|I orginally borrowed a copy of this book from my public library.  I liked it so much that I had to 'own' my own copy.  The author gave very good explanations on how to assemble & sew the many handbag, etc. versions.  Had only one problem in that I could not find what the seam allowance was.  I called the publisher & got a very quick answer.  The styles are of a nice variety.  My older sister who is a professional seamstress liked one style in particular & asked me to make a bag for her. That was a quite a compliment to the author/designer & me too!.  I highly recommend this book for all levels of ability.  And I am thrilled with the vendor & Amazon for fast service, etc.

B0040YFR1Y|5.0|I didn't even know this movie was out until I saw a preview for Showtime...I asked myself how did I miss this one. I go to 10-20 movies a year and I totally missed any previews. This tells me that the advertising budget was pretty nil. It was only a couple weeks before it aired so I figured I'd wait instead of rent. So I kept catching it at different parts of the movie and getting more and more intrigued. Then I finally got to watch the whole thing and I was very very pleased with how good it was!<br /><br />  Predators made more sense to me than all the other movies combined. 3 Predators on a game reserve honing their skills...instead of 1 Predator marooned on a planet with 6 billion people hoping to find some action. AvP brought up the concept of 3s but Predators expands on this giving them each a specific task. The Falconer-in charge of recon, The Trainer-in charge of stratagy testing weakness and strength and the berserker-The muscle of the group. A real fighting force. From my military background someone of Brody's stature makes more sense to me than Arnold....although Arnold, Ventura looks good on paper and film. It's just not reality. The people I knew in the seals and special forces were all average size..albeit in very good condition.<br /><br />  The movie starts with Royce falling from the sky and from that moment on it's nothing but action....Just what I'd hope for from an action movie! There wasn't a lot of dialog between characters but that's just what I'd expect from a group that was thrown together unexpectedly. The movie really pays homage to the original but it should it's a sequel. Like in the original the Predator hung it's prey in a tree. Same here. Royce covering himself with mud...well it was already told to him that this is how Dutch survived....The best tactics are passed on by the survivors. They used pretty much the same soundtrac as Predator, so they could have come up with something different but it didn't spoil the movie for me, as a matter of fact I barely even noticed because of all the action. The movie even gives a nod to Alien and I haven't seen any other reviews about this but what and where did the ancient tunnel boring mechine come from??? Why was it abandon??? Don't really need those answers not what the movie was about. It's about survival!<br /><br />  I think the casting was perfect! Brody pulled off a great action figure with Royce. The russian, The yakuza(sp) perfect! Fishburne was almost perfect as a schizophrenic survivor for 10 seasons...I say almost perfect because he is a little hefty for scavaging for so long....I would have laughted my a** off if he had called his friend Wilson! lol<br /><br />  In reality this is a 4 star movie but I believe it to be the best of all the Pred movies and the job they did with a minimal budget looked great so I give it another star. I'm ready for a sequel!!!<br /><br />  The blueray disc looked really good except the scene after the water fall was real grainy...the extra content was great. Gives some background on some of the characters before the abduction. Some of the deleted scenes they should have left in the movie especially the deathrow guys scenes.tter of fact I barely even noticed because of all the action.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this calculator,  it has big buttons so it makes it easy to read even without my glasses on. I love the back button so I don't have to start over and the best feature is the saved history so I don't have to write numbers down as I use the calculator. I would recomend this app to everyone!!!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|What a complete and total waste of money and time.  My only regret is that I didn't write it myself as its a huge seller.  Its unbelievable the amount of press that it has been given and the amount of people that have bought this book ... and educated, reflective, intelligent people. I found myself skipping through the sex scenes as they got boring and repetative ... and weren't written very well at all.  Honestly, I wouldn't bother with this one !
0802798225|5.0|Normally I'm not a fan of romantic teen novels, but this one was different. This book was hard to put down. Definitely recommend it.

B007O4XX9K|3.0|Avid Joe Walsh fan for 40+ years. I honestly expected to be disappointed by this cd.  However I was pleasantly surprised. Many excellent songs, the guitar playing, singing, lyrics and most instrumentation are spot on. So much too enjoy here. The lyrics tell you this is a much more personal work from Joe<br />  However the drumming is  so horrendous on all the songs that Jeff Lynne makes attempt to \\"play\\" drums, really embarrassing attempt. It detracts to the point of almost ruining all the stellar work. A straight click track probably would have served better on some songs rather then Jeff's mediocrity, at least it would not have detracted from the music.<br />  So in the end I must rate it lower than it deserves as the mediocre drumming will make it hard to listen often.<br />  If only Joe Vitale had played !!! ( or anyone, even a kid, who actually plays drums)
0345803485|4.0|I currently work as a cashier and have seen this book come through my line at least 3-5 times per day. At first it went unnoticed by me, but after some time I realized that this book is quite popular. I decided to finally pick up a copy and read it myself.<br /><br />I will admit, the writing is not the best. The repetition does irk me a bit. The main character blushes A LOT and she also bites her lip A LOT in this book. She also loves to describe Christian's \\"long index finger\\" A LOT. I myself am an amateur writer, but I know when repetition is too much. Once a reader NOTICES the same repetitive words, it goes to show that the writing is on the poor side. I mean, it is not terrible, but it is not great either. It would flow more nicely if she simply got rid of the repetition. For instance, maybe instead of having the main character blush so much, perhaps she could do something else to show discomfort? Maybe she could play with her hair, or twiddle her thumbs, or shift uncomfortably in her chair ... SOMETHING other than blushing! Doing so will eliminate repetition, but at the same time show readers that the main character is feeling uneasy about something.<br /><br />Now that I got the cons out of the way, let me focus on the pros and why I gave it 4 stars: This book originally worried me when people said there is a lot of sex in it. However, when I read it, I discovered there is more to it than JUST sex. I mean, yes there is sex, but not as much as people made it out to be. There is a story behind it. There are plenty of scenes that do NOT involve sex between the two main characters. Also, some people claim this book is degrading toward women. I see their point to an extent, but at the same time the female character is capable of leaving him anytime she chooses. It is not as though she is getting raped or forced into being a sex slave. She ultimately AGREES to the sex and even has to sign a contract to show her agreement. She has the ability to call it quits at anytime she chooses! So that is the point I am trying to make here. She has a choice and obviously likes the idea of the sex. It is not a one way street here where the man decides everything. If it was, then I would say so, but it's not in this book.<br /><br />Anyway, this book is not for everyone. This is a book for adults who do not mind reading sex scenes. Prude people, feminists, certain religious people, and children should steer clear.
B00122Z9DS|3.0|This album is a mixed bag of some gems and some mediocre material. The three instrumentals are solid. Far Cry, The Way The Wind Blows, and Faithless are very good songs. Tracks 2-5 are boring! No hooks. No memorable moments. The lyrics are dark throughout and need to be cut down! Geddy is storytelling not singing. The Good News First and Bravest Face are very forgettable.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Really fun game... Like the controls..it is hard to get the last piece sometimes but at least there isn't a timer so it's just annoying...Nice selection of free puzzles...
B00867HDTA|4.0|This is a fun game for entertaining yourself for a few minutes at a time. The game includes a number of different modes or exercises that keep the game from getting old. The various ball control techniques means you'll need to build skills to become better at the game.<br /><br />I've found no bugs or issues with this game.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|never goes past the start screen. I can click on choose image, choose gallery, choose an image and goes back to start sceen. I'm really glad I did not waste money on this and I feel bad for those that did.
0679809015|5.0|This book is very small but thick -  the perfect size to bring along in a purse or diaper bag. Our 15 month old has a blast with this - it features a lot of animals that are hidden behind various different doors or objects.. There are cats, a dog, goat, pig, pony, ducks, owls and a cow...the tabs are very durable and part of the book (NOT the flimsy kind that are just glued in.) I was happily surprised how much our daughter loves this - and how long she studies each picture. Very happy with the purchase and $4 well spend!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|this is a hells of a cool game I made my sister haha and so I love this game it is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo coool
0985114606|5.0|If you loved the Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy, then you will also love Bared to You: A Crossfire Novel. There are similarities with this book and the trilogy e.g. a girl falls for a wealthy self-made millionaire. The difference with this novel and the trilogy is that there is an even sadder story behind the awesome lusty, blood boiling sex. Sylvia Day is one lady who knows how to take the written word to a new level and entice the literacy virgin to a compulsive book worm. Thank you to all authors who help to bring the spice back and kick-start our sex lives.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This product is good.  It starts out with small tiles then gets bigger as you match more.  I also enjoy the different views of each game.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|Easy to use and very high quality images. It would be nice to edit filters.  Also, sharing to other apps in android would be great.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I enjoy this game very much, but it does challenge your ability with computer games.  At least it isn't real fast.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Nice features, had used photoshop express, but like this app better... Would recommend if you edit photos on your phone...
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This one is my go to waitng room game. You can spend a short time working out the puzzles or go for hours.  It has some easier levels and can get a bit challenging. Highly recommended.
B004XISI4A|5.0|I found this book, like it's predecessors ( The Game of Thrones1-4) amazing! It had me riveted and enthralled from the beginning ..it's a fairy tale for adults, without a predictable end! George Martin is a masterful writer who has the most incredible imagination for fantasy and weaving plots, bringing you a world of unparalleled mystery, treachery and the all too human quality of greed and selfishness. His characters are colorful and so is the realm they live in! A book to loose yourself in as you experience medieval  earth, steeped in a richness of prose that brings it life! I highly recommend this book(s). I can't wait for The Winds of Winter...*****
B0079IEPHA|5.0|...except one, and that one was still decent :P<br /><br />Harvey starts out as a hard-nosed attorney, who doesn't like to play by rules.  This is probably why he likes Mike, who is also pretty good at skirting the rules.  While Harvey gives Mike the opportunity to work for him, he sure doesn't make it easy.  However, you can tell that Harvey really does care, and the relationship between Harvey and Mike grows in every episode.  The relationships and dialog are what really make this show awesome, and the great music doesn't hurt it either.<br /><br />I absolutely love Gina Torres as Jessica, and the fact that both Harvey and Louis both answer to her. I hope that in season 2 we might get to see her in the courtroom :D<br /><br />Sarah Rafferty as Donna is priceless, especially when she is going up against Louis :D<br /><br />Overall, this was an amazing start to what (I hope) will be a long running show.
B0063GORYU|2.0|This game is much too easy  i have played many times and havent lost yet.  There is just no challenge.  But thanks for the free app.
B005LAIHSG|2.0|This review contains SPOILERS.  You have been warned :)<br /><br />After seeing the trailer, I thought I might be able to enjoy the movie, despite the fact that Kristen Stewart was playing Snow White. So I went into it thinking, I'll just focus on the story and Chris Hemsworth (whom I greatly enjoyed in Thor and The Avengers).<br /><br />The story started off oddly, first with the queen thinking she wanted a daughter with skin white as snow and lips red as blood and hair dark as a raven's feathers and then she suddenly had a daughter that would grow up to be that way.  Was she some sort of witch, casting a spell to cause her daughter to be that way? Did a fairy overhear and use magic to make that happen? It just seemed odd to me, especially as the queen plays no real role in the story and Snow White's description could been told to the audience in another way.<br /><br />I also thought that deus ex machina was envoked once or twice, especially in Snow White's convenient discovery of the nail... I suppose one could argue that her previous actions (from years earlier) were allowing her to find the nail as it was the fairies that live in the bodies of the birds that led her to it... however, what would be wrong with revealing that she has had the nail for years and was just waiting for someone to actually enter her cell in order to use it to make her escape? *shrug*<br /><br />Snow White's ability to stop a troll's rampage simply been standing in front of it seemed very contrived to me. Now, if this had happened after the fairy-elk-god thing had blessed her, yeah, that might have worked.  Not only would that have explained the troll walking away, but it also would have given the fairy-elk-god-blessing scene a reason for existing.  Maybe I'm just obtuse, but having seen this film only once in theaters I couldn't figure out a time in the movie when the fairy-elk-god's blessing affected anything. Maybe that is why the poison apple does not kill her, but none of that is alluded to in the film, so I am just hypothesizing.<br /><br />The poison apple was also another point of contention with me.  Not once was it mentioned that Snow White did not in fact die from the apple.  Maybe it was assumed that those in the audience have all seen Disney's Snow White before (which I have, but it has been a long time, so I don't remember the particulars), and thus know this part of the story.  Anyways, I find it amusing that the Huntsman does find a rather convincing way of kissing Snow White (though I don't understand the desire to kiss a dead body's lips, but that's a whole other topic) without having any knowledge that true love's kiss breaks the spell. However, afterward the entire incident is not explained.  Instead Snow White walks out and starts muttering about iron and swords and then incites the crowd into fighting.<br /><br />All that aside, I did like the way the evil queen deceived the king and the way that Snow White's childhood friend manages to join the riders of the evil queen.<br /><br />Overall, I did not like it.<br /><br />Also, what was with the evil queen standing in the fire?  Her clothes and hair did not appear to burn and yet her skin blistered.  I don't claim to know much about burning people, but I'm pretty sure clothes and hair go first. IMO, there was no need to add that to the film when it had nothing to do with the story line or character development.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was amazing. I just wanted to read it to see what the fuss was all about! I ended up downloading them to my IPad and read all 3 books!!! Once you start reading the first one you won't be able to put them down!!
B004EPYZV2|5.0|The Mission Impossible series is undoubtedly one of my favorite movie series because, unlike a lot of other movie series out there, they don't make hasty sequels just to rack in some more cash from devote fans (yes, I'm thinking of Transformers right now... much as I hate to say it because I loved the first movie).  Ghost Protocol is actually my favorite movie of the series, a spot which previously belonged to MI3 after it belonged to MI2... This is another oddity as even in many series where the sequels aren't horrible, they still can't beat the first one (ex. Pirates of the Caribbean).<br /><br />Anyways, on to the movie itself.<br /><br />Tom Cruise and Jeremy Renner both gave amazing performances. I love how the script manages to work in laugh-out-loud moments while still maintaining its serious nature and action that keeps you at the edge of your seat.<br /><br />While I know that the feats performed are impossible, they managed to lend it an amount of plausibility as things never turn out as planned.  Their technology works only about half the time, plans have to be changed and the new ones inevitably lead to new pitfalls, the team works together but still have reservations about one another.... All in all, I thought it was amazing. The revelation about Jeremy Renner's character was particularly momentous, as his role was primarily comedic up to that point.<br /><br />The music that was used in the movie enhanced the moments of tension and helped to create the atmosphere of the various foreign locales.  The cinematography was beautiful, and I can't get over the fact that Tom Cruise was actually hanging on the outside of Burj Khalifa (something I learned from the special features on my blu ray disk :P).<br /><br />My only complaint would be that Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) did not play a larger role in the film. However, as I loved the new cast in this movie, that is not a real disappointment.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I started this book with reluctance, NOT a fan of horror, and read half the book before I stopped waiting to be \\"Steven King Horrified\\". It never happened, and I became a Steven King fan. Ive read a lot of books, none of which made me feel an ache of knowing that the end was coming \\"too\\" soon. I miss reading it. The man is an artist. Period. I felt a loss of JFK, that I'm sure I would have felt if I had been born yet, that I can only relate to the loss I felt watching 9/11 on television. There was is no doubt in my mind, Steven King wept when the real 11/22/63 happened. I felt it through him. Thank you, kind sir.
B001NLKT60|3.0|This part of the series is kind of tedious and hard to follow.  Not as exciting as the first in the series.
B002SAUCBC|5.0|I didn't even want to put my Kindle down. Short but incredibly written. First Stephen King novel I've read and now all I want to do is read more from him. I couldn't believe how involved I had gotten with the characters until I knew their fate!<br /><br />I recommend to anyone who loves to read :)

085490087X|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2GS6FFVP0NR7Y]]<br /><br />OUR SPLENDID LANDSCAPE HAS DEVELOPED LEGALLY<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />As histories go, this splendid and grand story will have a wide range of admirers for the straightforward way in which the beautiful English landscape has developed over the centuries at the direction of the law itself.<br /><br />The focus of the book concerns the role of English Land Law as a pivotal shaper of the modern landscape through the ages. The book's story is told in chronological order with an excellent Foreword by Fiona Reynolds from the National Trust.  We hope to see this book in the Trust's shops in future because it will be of great interest to Trust members visiting its properties.<br /><br />The story starts with pre-history, covering Roman and Anglo-Saxon times.  It then reviews the creation of today's English land law as we know it by the Normans with substantial developments in the Middle Ages as the Conquest changed the face of the country with land being the most important form of property ownership.<br /><br />Christopher Jessel neatly describes the way in which landed property set the agenda for `society' in the 17th century when ownership rights became protected to such an extent that land rights prevented real change until the introduction of the rules against perpetuities and accumulations and many other land reforms.<br /><br />The history of our landscape shows how laws were gradually introduced which adapted or circumvented the original interests in land granted originally by the King. Parliamentary intervention also rearranged the landscape with measures such as the Inclosure Awards and the Prescription Act which are still of relevance today. With the Industrial Revolution came the building of roads, canals and railways which developed many areas from small communities to towns and cities of today.<br /><br />Our landscape today is the envy of the world, especially if one flies over the countryside to see its present beauty as such a special landscape. Jessel concludes this delightful and engaging story with a view of what is happening today: the era of public access to land, laws to protect the environment, and the impact of European legislation which will appeal to the general readership as well as historians and lawyers: the book has pride of place in our bookcase.he world, especially if one flies over the countryside to see its present beauty as such a special landscape.

B0086700CM|4.0|I like it I don't love it just because it does freeze up some I have an ipod and its way better on there but anyways its a good game
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Made a 2.5 hour flight seem too short! With each new level, itnwas an &quot;Oh my god!&quot; reaction; and that was for the easy courses. You don't think it's possible, but there's always a way. Great game that you take at your own pace.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is a great game that has clips from Ice Age movies, foods to feed the stranded animals, and more!
B0073Q0DZG|5.0|This is such a fun movie to watch, the story is interesting, the scenery is beautiful, the actors are fun to watch as they race to identify all the birds.  Would recommend to all bird and nature lovers.

B004I8WD7S|5.0|This set is much cheaper then other covers/cases - especially if you look at Apple store. It is good quality product. It comes with screen protector which is very good and very easy to put on your iPhone - even if you never did this before. iPhone fits in the protective case just perfect. Some people could not like that there is Amazon logo on the back of the case but if you don't care then this is product for you. Price is excellent, very attractive.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|you can earn everything you want in this game. there's no feeling that your stuck because the developers want you to spend money.
1466401885|5.0|As Romance novels go, I have this one on my virtual book shelf right between Twilight and Fifty Shades of Grey. I'd recommend it to readers who want a good love story that is a little spicier than YA but not quite rated X. :-)
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This is a very easy app to use. Download was simple but it can slow down your device. I love the reminders.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This game has a slightly misleading title because although you can eventually get 124 games you have to buy them with points. You get points for reviewing so that's what this is for.
B0040QYROA|5.0|From early childhood, I heard references, often wistful if not awed, to Metropolis.  When I finally saw it, I was indeed dazzled, but also left with the feeling that I had not so much visited a wonderful city of the future as toured a collection of artifacts from its ruins.  Now I have been there.<br /><br />I fully believe that this film remains a high point, possibly *the* high point, of film-making.  I question whether any later director and crew, with the benefit of sound and color and special effects and the simple advantage of decades of good films to watch and learn from, have ever surpassed it.
0099579936|4.0|First of all I love this trilogy.  I think some of negativity is from women that are uptight about their sexuality and have \\"hang ups.\\"  Women, this book is a fantasy and was meant to stir up your inner goddess and spark yoursexual relationship.  Secondly, most books are written at a tenth grade reading level, unless your talking about the Harry Potter type books.  Third, the main is written to be young, inexperienced, and whinny.  Their are plenty of young college girls that are like this women.  I think women forgot how they were in their early twnties in college.<br />Lastly, enjoy this fantasy book and possibly use some of the techniques in the bedroom.
B007P6VLRS|5.0|I for one never stopped believing Billy could write great songs like some people.  I already can't wait for the next album to see what direction Billy takes the band.  I've always appreciated his commitment to finding a new sound instead of sticking with what worked years ago.
B007SSDS24|3.0|Very imaginative creatures and clever setting, weighted with an ordinary story line and pedestrian characters.  Made for teenage audiences. It's what an old acquaintance once called a \\"popcorn\\" movie - you watch it, eat some popcorn, and the next day you've forgotten what you saw.
B002VPE1XE|3.0|I received this as a free gift with my camera purchase. The case itself is ordinary (nothing fancy), it has a velcro flap (I much prefer a zipper) and it has a simple wrist band holder. Seeing as it was free I really can't complain, but I will say I'm thankful I didn't spend any money on it. I ended up giving this to my 13yr old daughter for her camera and she seemed perfectly content with it.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|this summer at my church we are doing a &quot;dare&quot; to read the Bible 5 minutes 5 times a week. and this app has plans that are days,weeks,months,years long. its soo nice because the app has reminders for each day and its easy to commit to. I would recommend it to someone searching for an easy way to get more in sync with God.

B0086700CM|4.0|my younger sister downloaded this game and I didn't realize it. seriously, its really pretty fun. ive only been playing for about 15 mind but seriously, try it
0345803485|3.0|I have to agree with many other reviews and say the book is NOT well written... but something about the characters sucked me in.  I will not rehash the plot since so many others have done that.  I will agree that by book 3, I was skimming through the sex scenes.  Initially they were intersting, but got boring quickly.<br /><br />It is such an unrealistic book, it really should go in the fantasy section.  I worry young women might read this and think they should be having two orgasms every time they have sex.  Also, this guy seems to have some magical wonder weiner that rises to the challenge every five minutes.  NOT, not realistic.<br /><br />I'm a happily married woman in my mid-30s.  It was a fun quick read.  If you want to zip through something different give it a try.  I read all 3 in one week and found the overall experience fine.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I think this app is best app in the amazon app store and I like it very much but I would like to more than function.

B0030IIYWA|5.0|All in all an amazing package. I have just watched Toy Story countless times but I do not remember it ever being this clear. The sound and crispness of the image is unprecedented. Excellent job Pixar. By far their best work as far as story and character design goes. When Buzz attempts to fly over Sid's stair banister it still gets to me. Wonderful product. Buy it now!
B003K16P3M|2.0|Spoilers ahead<br />I was almost considering not reading the rest of graceling, almost half way through and the plot was still slow. However it did pick up, and I started to take interest in it. The characters were well developed and the plot was a winner. I was disappointed then, when Leck was killed so instantly, but I was willing to forgive it. I thought maybe better things are in store, however as I read that Po's sight had been taken away, I felt betrayed, like this was the \\"big event\\" that had made Leck's swift death worth it. Sure enough, the author seems to him and haw throughout the rest of the book, touching on lightly and clumsily on Katsas thoughts that she will never marry, (which I would never believe, someone would readily give up their freedom for the true love of another), and Po's tragic accident that seems to have no bearing on anything whatsoever. The plot is a winner but the ending is so unsatisfying. I guess it is a good book for a debut novel or a very long short story. It could have been condensed into half the size and been a better read. I am sorry if I seem like a negative nellie, I do not hate the book, I just thought it could have been much better, so much opportunity to be something really amazing.
B008469DGY|5.0|I like golfing games so this 99 purchase made sense. Good physics and sharp graphics. Wish putting and chipping were included but understand why they weren't.
B0086700CM|5.0|its really fun ...grant it you do get bored but there are many level ups and different characters you can choose from. such as the fastest runner the cunning escape artist and so on and so on..... :)
B007SGM084|5.0|I have not read a book n years because I really did not like to read; but after reading Fifty Shades, I have found a new love for reading!! Great book, great story and would strongly Recomended. Sad when it was over :(
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I have fun with this...but I can only play it from time to time because it can get boring. I would reccomend it though. The adds aren't noticeable.
0345803485|1.0|As an avid reader of a variety of books, I feel I am a good judge of well written work- and THIS was NOT one of them! I am shocked at the amount of people who seem to love these series...and it leads me to be believe that most of these people probably don't read that often, therefore thinking this was actually GOOD writing?! First of all, it took me forever just to decide to read the books based on the product description \\"Ana meets young hot billionaire and likes him...he likes her...they start a relationship\\"...okay maybe not in those exact words, but that's basically the gist- so from the get go it didn't seem interested. But after hearing all the hub-ub over this, I caved. And FULLY regret that decision!<br />This author has the writing style of a 5th grader...who was probably using a thesaurus...and yet STILL overused the terms \\"I gasp\\", \\"I gape\\", \\"I blush\\"....as if these overused terms weren't enough, the entire book was them having sex. And mediocre sex at best! There was nothing remotely sexy about the writing, and how often this girl orgasmed..apparently she just had to look at Christian to have an orgasm- if only it were that easy. There was NOTHING substantial in this story, no plot to follow, no big mystery...it was them having sex every page. And the S&M crap was horrible...this was supposedly what made the book so \\"interesting\\"....but all the author did was TALK about the \\"weapons\\"...rarely were they used!<br />If a person in real life was actually dating someone like Christian, it would be considered an abusive relationship and you'd be telling the person to get out as fast as they could! He was controlling, domineering, weak, and totally unrealistic! I'm actually flabbergasted at the amount of attention this series has received, and think it's a damn shame to see how many great pieces of literature there are out there, yet THIS is the one people are talking about?<br />DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY- you will never get either one back again! I could go on forever about all the crap this story bought about, but I feel it's already taken too much of my time...don't say I didn't warn you!go on forever about all the crap this story bought about, but I feel it's already taken too much of my time...don't say I didn't warn you!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its a good idea and all but it just isn't that fun...none of the games are addictive and u have to pass each game to unlock a new one...I bearly reccomend it so please don't waste your time.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Play everyday!! Excellent App!!! Just needs to have opportunity to choose winning deals for Kindle version like ipod version. Purchase recommended!!

B007IXWKUK|2.0|It started to get boring and repititious about 1/4 of the way through.  Really got tired of the stupid email correspondence.  First book was much better.
098478280X|5.0|This is an amazing book for passing a coding interview.  I have personally used this book with much success.  Even if the questions aren't the ones you'll get, it puts you in the right frame of mind and really makes you at ease with the interview process.  If you are thinking whether or not you need this book, the answer is a resounding yes.  Even if you have done well at your current job, your interview skills may be rusty.  Working through the problems in this book will knock the rust right off.  The chapters are logically organized and the compendium of answers in the back is super helpful.  This is a must have for the coding interviewer or interviewee.  My guess is that this book will change the way interviews are done going forward as they will be too easy to study for and pass.  Just get the book, already :)
B007IXWL2C|1.0|The author should have stopped after the first book.  How many ways and how many times can the main characters profess their love?  Even the sex scenes got tiresome.  Mushy dialogue, contrived situations, too unrealistic.  If you want a boring read, go ahead and read this.
B007H9B8FS|5.0|I've been their fan since day one and my expectations for all their albums have always been exceeded.<br /><br />With all due respect, this is arguably the best and most consistent Garbage CD yet.<br /><br />The Deluxe Edition features 15 tracks, among them 4 stellar bonus tracks, that once you go through the first few listens, will grow on you and will become new Garbage classics.<br /><br />A fact that strikes me as a genius move is that this CD pays homage to all previous Garbage CDs, as almost every song (the exception being Bright Tonight) seems to stick to a particular style from these.<br /><br />My favorite songs have been changing since the first listen, which is a rare feat in a CD with these many songs, to a point that I play the whole CD with the same level of excitement from start to finish.<br /><br />I grew up as a fan of 70s-80s music, but when GARBAGE was released in 1995 it gave me plenty of reasons to include them as a few of the 90s acts among my favorite rock acts of all time (The Police, Toto, U2, Pink Floyd, Depeche Mode, Journey, Foo Fighters, Tom Petty, Queen, Pat Benatar, Linkin Park, Hall & Oates, Eagles, Duran Duran and Billy Joel).<br /><br />Congratulations to Garbage for a superb CD.<br /><br />Edit:  It is a shame that the Deluxe Edition (and indeed essential to all Garbage fans) is no longer directly available from Amazon as the extra tracks are as excellent as the rest of material in the standard edition.  Fans need to enjoy this cd in its Deluxe edition.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is a great implementation of a fun, good game. Good puzzle, thinking game. Similar thinking as needed in Sudoku. Looks great, easy to use.
B000V6583C|5.0|We have all heard the songs off this record that get played to death on the radio. These songs are so popular for a reason. Beyond those songs though the rest of the tracks are just as good. This album has no weak points and you just can't go wrong with this epic album. Records like those only come around once so often and if you enjoy music then you need to hear this.
0345803485|5.0|its a great book as soon as i was done i had to go buy the other two parts. dont hesitate to buy
0345803485|2.0|Wow what a disappointment!<br /><br />I powered through the last book of the Hunger Games because I was dying to read this book (I wish I never finished Hunger Games...).<br />The first few chapters are pretty good, it gets you ready for what's coming! Or at least it tries....<br />The first sex scene, even the second, yeah they were decent, I was excited to continue reading.<br />I am half way through the book (almost!) and I am so over it already......I have no interest in finishing it. Anastasia is so irritating! There are so many sides of her, (inner goddess, her own thoughts, herself talking...) I feel this book should be titled \\"50 Personalities of Steel\\".<br /><br />I swear if she bites her lip one more time, I may shoot my Kindle. Or set it on fire so it can live up to its name.<br /><br />I'm done, I don't feel the need to finish the story.<br /><br />BTW, did you all know they are trying to cast Kristen Stewart to play Anastasia? Gag
B0086700CM|4.0|It is fun, but really no end, just keep on Jumping, Turning, Sliding, and Running until the bird guards get you. I wish they had made an ending or different levels.
0439023513|3.0|I was a big fan of the first and even second book of the Hunger Games. I thought each was well-paced, contained an enjoyable plot, and was well written. The third book, however, left me feeling disappointed and depressed. I felt like some portions were too long and drawn out leaving other, more important sections, rushed and with too little detail. I especially disliked how many important scenes occurred while Katniss was locked up or incapacitated and were merely explained to her later. This took a lot of the action and suspense out of the story. Also, the ending of the book, which seems as if they should be somewhat happy, still leaves me with a feeling of sadness. Great ideas, poor execution.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|This is a quality game, and definitely one of the best match-3/jewel games I've ever played. Very fun gameplay that always makes me want to play one more round.  Earning stars to level up special powers is a lot of fun, and the continuous addition and evolution of those abilities keep the game interesting as you progress further in.  Love it!
0439023521|5.0|I love this book. I saw the movie first on a whim and picked up the trilogy of books the same night. I had trouble putting this book down and thoroughly enjoyed it. There are some differences between book and movie but not enough to  put a damper on either. I would definitely recommend the first book to others!
B0057567P0|1.0|I bought a this and a brand new Crucial 512gb SSD drive, with an OWC USB 3.0 enclosure. The OWC enclosure is fantastic and so is the Crucial SSD, until after using the Sonnet Express card on my 2011 Macbook Pro 17\\". Within a few minutes it fried my $400.00 drive.  I thought maybe I did something wrong, until I researched this and found reviews stating the same thing happened to them with other drives. I'm out the cash for the drive and the POS Sonnet, because their support and service is also a POS. I'm sure others have been successful, but no one should have a product that fries hard drives. I was afraid to use it again and took great joy in running over it with one of the forklifts at my place of business.<br /><br />Now I have the new Macbook Air and Macbook Pro, both with built in USB 3.0 and they work beautifully!!<br /><br />Stay away from Sonnet....<br /><br />I Love Amazon!! (Even though this time I purchased elsewhere) If I had purchased from Amazon, they probably would have gladly helped me out in this situation.<br /><br />I hope this helps someone from making the same mistakes.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scott

B002S0OBMS|5.0|I finally got the chance to see Love Never Dies on PBS and ordered the CD within hours of the show ending. For the casual viewer, this may not be a good sequel (I don't think my Mother would enjoy this- she liked Phantom of the Opera). Give it a try - it may surprise you.

1451683405|2.0|Sam Harris, to begin with, is to be highly commended for bringing into the spotlight an issue that generationally we have taken for granted;  Do we have free will?  His concept and proofs leading to his ultimate conclusion are well done and, for the most part, highly convincing.  It is an easy read, short and to the point and I strongly advise readers to peruse this essay when they have an opportunity.<br /><br />But, having had a career in Mental Health, leads me to a slightly more skewed conclusion.  It starts with answering the question of \\"How do we explain this process when people actually do make significant personality changes?\\".  At this point the author's treatise fails dramatically.  While Mr. Harris is absolutely correct in identifying the controlling power of the subconscious on the actions that are caused through genetical imprinting or learned psychosocial behavior patterns, he does not take the agent of change into consideration.  To him if a child is genetically born into an physically abusive family, he, too, will automatically become an abuser.  Even though such is the case the majority of the time, all behaviors, like abusiveness, can be overcome.  The steps necessary to do this is, through long term and diligent 'reprogramming', to flood the driving subconscious with conscious reasoning of why you do not want this behavior pattern to exist in your life.  The subconscious is almost like a simple balance scale;  on one side you have '100 pounds' of data and impulses that encourages and drives a person toward further abuse, on the other side you must add conscious reasoning in order to offset these impulses.  Once you have '100 pounds' on the non-abusive side, the thoughts and impressions regarding this action have a 50:50 chance of being either abusive or non-abusive.  Obviously, to get to the point of higher and higher favorability of having a non-abusive thought emerge from a given situation, you are required to add more and more and more rational and peaceful thoughts to the non-abusive thoughts on our imaginary scale. Will the original psychosocial thoughts and impulses to abuse another ever completely go away?  No, but they can become more and more unlikely to appear as the opposite side of the scale is added to.<br /><br />So, in spite of the fact that I applaud Mr. Harris's treatise and the thoughts that went behind it, we are not doomed to future failures based on our uncontrolled pasts.  But, to be frank, the number of persons/clients that I have encountered over time that are able to make the commitment to make these drastic and time consuming changes and to undergo the difficult work that is necessary is highly limited.  Far less than 10% of our population are willing and/or able to make these changes.  The work becomes too hard, the time involved takes too long and the social structure around them discourages dissimilarity within their group.  So, because of this small percentage of consciously active persons, the author, from the sidelines, can obviously view conscious change as not taking place and, therefore, we must operate out of an unchangeable subconscious.  Fortunately, for those who demand more out of their existence other than the morass in which they were raised or the susceptibility of the genes they inherited, there is a clear path towards change.  It may be hard, it may be tedious and may even seem fruitless at times, but it is there.l and peaceful thoughts to the non-abusive thoughts on our imaginary scale.

B007ZXK08C|1.0|poorly written with a lazy ending. do not waste your time on this ordinary book. the plot was interesting enough to get me to the end but the let down was disappointing. one of the worst books that i have ever read.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this trilogy.  Maybe all major works should be trilogies.<br /><br />The characters were nicely developed for the reader, and the plotline kept me interested through the very last page.<br /><br />Even though the book appears to be written for a teen or twenty-something audience, the stroy appealed to me, a 40 something.  The lead character is a strong female, but with some personality quirks, which made her identifiable to regular people.  You could understand her troubles and dilemmas throughout the books.<br /><br />I would definitly recommend these books to anyone, but especially to teens and 20 somethings.  You have to use your imagination, and that is a good thing!

The sound level on After the Cosmic Rain has numerous drop outs. But when you miss the live tour like I did, you're grateful for every little bit. The hour-long documentary on the DVD mixes audio commentary with concert footage. The commentary is excellent and there are some wonderful insights and genuinely funny bits. But then the \\"bad\\" heads its ugly rear. Example: Chick is just raving about Frank Gambale's unique picking style. They cut to some concert footage with Frank soloing away, but the director instead chooses to show every band member EXCEPT Frank! Hey, a close up of Frank's technique would have been nice here! During the clip for Medieval Overture, they don't show Lenny doing those awesome drum fills! It's like the director didn't know the music and had the cameras on the wrong players. Very disappointing.<br /><br />I haven't listened to the CDs yet. On the DVD the musicianship is spectacular if you can overlook all the production flaws.<br /><br />EDIT:<br />I've listened to the audio portion and have prepared the following opinions:<br /><br />Let's start with the packaging. As I unwrapped my Father's Day gift and caught my first glimpse of the CD cover art, I thought \\"Santana's Moonflower? I already have it.\\" OK, it's a bit different, but this RTF cover is oddly bland and not particularly noteworthy nor original.<br /><br />Liner notes: enough with the space metaphors. It was silly back in the '70s and it's just plain lame now.<br /><br />Now to the music.<br /><br />Medieval Overture:<br />I've always found this tune a bit overdone, tedious, disjointed, etc. It still is. The redeeming moments for me on the original recording were the huge fills from Lenny. Sadly, they just aren't the same 35+ years later. That's OK, there are many things I don't do as well today as I did in the '70s. Lenny makes up for it later on other tunes.<br /><br />Senor Mouse<br />Sr. Mouse sets the tone for much of the remainder of this effort. When it's the RTF core jamming (Chick, Stan, Lenny) with the two new sidemen (JLP and Frank) silent or just comping chords, the trio really COOKS. Nonetheless, I will say that Frank's solo on this tune is quite tasty.<br /><br />JLP shines in duet with Chick on Shadow of Lo, which transitions into Sorceress. The group quickly moves the tune into a hard rock break with Frank soloing over the top. This didn't work for me. Back to the familiar Sorceress riffs with Stanley taking the lead. Ah that's more like it. Slide into Chick's piano solo break and we're off and running. Again, the trio rocks it. Who are these other two guys again?<br /><br />Renaissance<br />I like JLP as a sideman, but his compositions are monotony with a fusion beat. I went through a JLP phase in the 70s and I'm over it. The main benefit to listening to his band was that it turned me on to Allan Holdsworth. (Holdsworth in RTF is an interesting proposition.) This tune? Yawn.<br /><br />Cosmic Rain<br />This is the best tune on the set. The band really brings something new with this effort. Unfortunately you have to get through the first 3 minutes before things really get cranked up. JLP takes a nice turn, evolving into a syncopated Latin motif. Chick picks it up with some lush synth chords that slide into a way cool Fender/Moog shuffle anchored by Lenny, with Stan walking the Alembic. So sweet! Give me two hours of this trio and I'll be happy! Then Stan takes his turn with what can only be described as a Flamenco bass solo.<br /><br />Romantic Warrior<br />Five minutes of noodling before you get to the head. Finally. Things start to move. I'm not crazy about Frank's voicing on the acoustic here. Too much twang. This is an acoustic piece and his axe sounds overly processed. Did I mention that trio? Lenny does some tasty work on this one. Chicks piano solo is classic. These 3 cook with gas.<br /><br />Spain<br />We all know this one. Chick starts it off, joined by JLP. Very nice. Ensemble joins in for the melody. Lenny gets a chance in the spotlight and doesn't let us down. Cool stuff. Chick solos on Fender with crowd sing-along. I could do without these audience participation efforts. I'd rather hear the true musicians work their craft.<br /><br />School Days<br />This tune just feels out of place to me on an RTF effort. School Days is Stan's \\"Free Bird\\" or \\"Stairway to Heaven\\". Do we really need another live version of this anthem? Don't get me wrong, SC is one of my favorite performers. I've seen him live so many times in clubs, duet (with Hiromi), with RTF, and blowing the roof off large arenas (New Barbarians, Atlanta Omni). Every time I've seen him he doesn't disappoint. But can we give School Days a rest?<br /><br />Beyond the 7th Galaxy<br />Sounds surprisingly true to the original studio effort with Stan's fat bass sound. A nice end to the set.<br /><br />Overall some really fine musical moments combined with a few misses, for me anyway. Four stars for the audio portion. Two stars for the DVD. Three stars average.

B00571F26Y|5.0|My review is long over due, but I just recommended this book again, to a few more folks, just this week.  If the surplus of five star reviews doesn't impress you to try this way of eating to drop pounds fast, eliminate the &#34;cobwebs,&#34; or &#34;brain fog&#34; that's inhabiting your brain and affecting your moods, and improving your overall health, who knows what will!<br /><br />In 2011, I decided to adopt a low carb way of eating b/c I had read that this way of eating reduced cholesterol.  Since I do not take pills well, I figured changing my diet would be the easiest way to accomplish this.  All I did was give up was wheat and sugar.  After I got through the &#34;wheat withdrawal&#34; symptoms, I felt so great, physically as well as mentally, like my endorphins were on a permanent &#34;high.&#34;  I didn't experience any panic attacks or loss of energy b/c my blood sugar rarely got low.  The most amazing thing though, for me was losing my needs for steroid Asthma inhalers.<br /><br />Having Asthma since I was a kid, I was used to taking all sorts of pills and later in life I progressed to steroid inhalers which were incredibly detrimental to my quality of life.  But after I gave up wheat, my Asthma took a hiatus and only returns if I'm not managing my stress sufficiently.<br /><br />I had heard about this book in the summer of that pivotal year for me, but resisted buying it, thinking it was just another low-carb book.  How wrong I was!  In that book I found out that there is nothing basic about the bread we eat, that it has been genetically modified for us to eat more, and more, and more!  One thing I always ask new folks is about the bread, or crackers, that restaurants serve before they place your order in front of you.  The scene is so predictable.  Of course we're hungry, otherwise we wouldn't be at a restaurant, right?  I was guilty as the next, when I reached for a piece of bread and dabbed it lightly with the buttery spread.  No one eats bread plain,do they?  And sometimes, if I was really hungry, I might have more, but sometimes it would be hard to stop, and just wait for the meal!  It was such a relief to find out it wasn't my fault!  After that, I never looked at fat people the same again.<br /><br />But when you make a product dirt cheap, wheat that is, I can see where folks would have a hard time giving it up. Less than two years ago, they opened up a bakery/bar at San Francisco International Airport in Terminal One.  Why is it that things are so much more expensive at the airport?  High rent is my guess.  So if one of the products is dirt cheap to produce, why wouldn't they sell it.  Plus, the fifty percent discount they give to airport employees, could have been another advantage to get rid of a product fast, with little to no effort, is my guess, judging by their lines at closing time.<br /><br />Yes, there was a learning curve for me, to eat wheat and sugar free, but I'm worth it, and you are too!  I can buy a lot of things, but I can't buy better health.

B0077SGMXM|4.0|this game is fun and addictive. I have wasted lots of time playing this game. I got it when it was the free app of the day.
B0018QQQK8|3.0|The Lucky One was an enjoyable light read.  It was true Nicholas Sparks....a little predictable, and I got the feeling it was written more for a movie script than purely a story one would read.  Could almost see the movie playing in my head as I read along, and I haven't seen the movie.  Sparks's novels are alway perfect for a recreational read that doesn't tax the gray matter too much in the process.  I have to think creatively hours on end in my career so when I take the time to read for pleasure I want it to be relaxing and fun, and this book delivered that.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I absolutely love this game its so fun. the price is not bad either. It is a must have for all ages.
B00006CXSS|5.0|How could anyone watch even just one of these films and NOT develop a deep appreciation for and respect for the brave men who fought in evil times?! Such a well-done series. Very heartbreaking and inspiring.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|This is the best App that I have! This is awesome. I had no Trouble with this app. Learned alot new things!
B00785P2QC|4.0|entertaining! very simple and fun and if you are not sure what to do, it has tips and hints for you until you get the hang of it.
B007D2XSW0|3.0|Works fine on ASUS Transformer and in landscape mode always nice when docked that many apps don't.<br /><br />Nothing spectacular but ok for what it does,<br /><br />Why is it Droid X and Galaxy 2 are the devices anything complex doesn't work on and the users just don't get thats the problem not the apps?
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I love this app. It does great edits and it's easy to use. I take a lot of pictures of my kids and now I can make them even more unique.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I really wanted to love this book... but the plot was slightly unbelievable and the ending was God awful..... resulting in disappointment.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This game is so addicting.  I don't know how long it will take to complete it, but I can't stop playing it until I do.
B003ZHVJFA|1.0|I am a fan of the Tekken games and the DOA and King of Fighters movies so I thought this would be an okay movie, I was wrong. This movie was one of the worst movies I have watched in a long while. I still make fun of it for how much it says Tekken throughout the film, they changed the name of the city and corporation to Tekken City and the Tekken Corporation. I am fairly certain that the did this so you would remember what piece of garbage movie you were watching. One of the two characters I wanted to see in it wasn't in it and the other was just mangled into something completely different than how he is in the games. DOA and King of Fighters were fun and kind of cheese movies this wasn't.
B008CPZNL6|4.0|This app aggregates your favorite news and updates from your social networks in a pleasing graphical interface. It is similar to [[ASIN:B005S6EYJE ChannelCaster Pro: Social News]] and other graphical news apps.<br /><br />I've been testing it in beta for last last month or so on a Galaxy Nexus and it works great for finding your favorite news sites and topics and pulling them in for you to flip through. I've run into issues with some pages running at a very small text size without the ability to zoom in via pinch/zoom and many outside news sources or RSS feeds are not optimized for flipping through.<br /><br />What sets this app apart is how you navigate. Basically you slide your finger up to flip through the pages. I admit is pretty cool but it basically does the same thing as a bunch of other programs.<br /><br />Bottom line this is a good news and social networking aggregation app that I like slightly more than ChannelCaster Pro. Give it a shot.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|Its not a bad app. I got it for free today and its fun to load up pictures and edit and play with them.I just don't think it is worth 5 bucks. Works great on kindle fire. 4 stars out of 5.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like the different varieties of games that you can play. This is a great app. Everyone should buy it.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|This is the best photo editing program I've ever come across on a phone, no doubt about it. Glad I was able to get it for free, but would have gladly paid $5 for it!
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I have been waiting for this to be released on Kindle. I have it on my iPhone and I love it.. so I am ecstatic to learn the app is now in Amazon Store. Probably the best newsfeeder app there is. Awedome graphics and layout!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|This app destroys the competition so easily. The interface is perfect for ICS. Would buy at full price. Galaxy Nexus.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Great movie to keep in the archives and great to watch in high definition. The movie background features are really well done. It's worth the price.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is the game for when yur board!;) its so cool and realy fun.when i get board with my other apps I just play this.DOWNLOAD THIS GAME!!!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|All of the games are fun and addicting.  Definately really like this app :)  I look forward to future updates and apps!
B006RUJST6|5.0|I have been reading 50shades and the likes. Soon started reading amazons recommended books (based on the books I read earlier) I honestly thought this was a really good series. Well thought of, sensitive and deep.
0345803493|5.0|After I received Fifty Shades of Grey, I was NOT expecting to want to read all 3 books right away.  Darker was such a great book.  It tied up so many loose ends of Fifty, but created so many little plot twists of its own!  I loved how their relationship grew and how she was FINALLY getting to him :)  I want more books!!  I'm not going to lie!!  Not much of an avid reader, but I just couldn't put any of the 3 books down, I wanted to know what was going to happen!  Great trilogy, I recommend it!
0515149489|5.0|This was the first book by Nora Roberts that I have read and I simply loved it. It did NOT have too much information about dog training for me, as dog training is my passion.  I was impressed by Nora Roberts knowledge of dog training methods - she has done her research - and I have recommended this book to other friends who also train dogs.  Most books who have dog trainers in them do not offer much realistic information about dog training, but it is clear that Roberts either has done some training or she did her research. Either way, I loved the characters, as they were well developed, and the suspense in the book kept me on the edge till the end.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a great read!
0345803507|5.0|After my husband bought me Fifty Shades of Grey, I didn't think much of it.  I definitely didn't know I'd be reading it so quickly.  Before I was done, I knew I HAD to order the other 2 books so I could continue with the trilogy.  I was so sad at the way the first one ended that I NEEDED to read the second one.  After the second one...of course I had to get Freed!!  I loved everything about this book and the trilogy.  I'm not that much of an avid reader, but let me tell you, I wanted to read this one slower than the first 2 (because I read the first one in 3 days and the 2nd one in a little over 24 hours...).  I didn't want it to end, and I definitely went through Christian and Ana withdrawals!  I 100% recommend this trilogy, and I love the way the author ended it.

B008A1NSTG|5.0|This is a GREAT movie.  It's the most enjoyable I've seen in a while.  John Krasinski plays is exact character from \\"The Office\\", which is my favorite tv show.  His character works really well in this movie.  It was a heart warming magical movie.  It's also really informative.  You learn things about Greenpeace, whales, the Arctic, and Alaska oil drilling.  This movie also has a humorous aspect worked in, which makes it more light hearted, and fun to watch.
B007KDFWRG|5.0|I just bought this last night & i have now played it 3 time's! I love it!!This may just be one of the best live recorded albums ever. Revelator was a good album but it just did show what a great live band they are. Every song on here sounds fantastic. They open right up with grit & power. The whole band as a group play spot on perfect just fantastic musicianship. But the recording of the show is amazing. It has this feel like your in the front row of a hall. The seperation of the Vocals'Guitar'Drums,horn section is unreal & i have never heard a live album sound so good. If you like anything from Tedeschi or Truck's or even The Allman Brothers There is no way you will not like this album.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love the variety of translations and daily devotionals. certain translations offer a speaker reading option. great search resource when I'm looking for specific scriptures.
B007H9B8FS|5.0|Excellent album, it was worth waiting for 7 years. It's an album that has a bit of garbage in the beginning but updated to 2012 (version 3.0) ...<br /><br />Shirley's voice sounds more mature, but still one of the best female voices in alternative rock history, and the boys showed why they are accomplished musicians.<br /><br />Personally I love the whole album, is more than I expected!<br /><br />Thanks for come back!!!
B001S86J0I|5.0|This film might seem a bit corny on first blush, but if the viewer actually pays attention, has some great spoofs (particularly on Star Trek), and when looking even deeper, has some great messages about loyalty, and following through: stuff our parents were trying to get through to us when we were kids. (Great article on this movie is in Wickepedia.) I'm also a fan of the main stars in this film--it's nice to see them in something other than the TV series we were used to seeing them in. Additionally, the film has great special effects. The film gives us all this without getting oh-so-serious like other science fiction films I could mention.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Enjoyed all three.  Was glad to get an answer to the who-dunnit/how & why.  This triology offered a bit of everything. Romance some of it fantastical due to him being a billionaire.  Suspense.  Erotica with realistic descriptions that doesn't sound like it came out of a porno mag/movie.  It really is a love story.  Nothing wrong with that.
B0086700CM|5.0|I play this all the time whenever I get bored I play it for like an hour.... they actually came out with temple run BRAVE cant wait for it to come out on kindle fire
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Me love this books. Me read all time. Never stop. Super A+ 100% fantastic! Karate! Freemont real word. Me friends say it. They Phocrase.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this app is totally amazing! I play it everyday! its so exciting the only concern I have is that some people draw really really slow
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Some of the games are challenging other are simple. So far the best part is trying to earn enough points for the next game.
1451608659|5.0|I am only 3/4 through this wonderful autobiography but I had to stop and review it.  The description of the abuse she suffered at the hands of the Karolyis makes me wonder why they are still today at the top of the sport in USAG, choosing the national and Olympic team.  We have read over and over of how the Karolyis tortured their girls back in Romania, not allowing them to visit the bathroom alone in fear of their drinking some water, outright slapping and beating them.  Now we hear of how he was able even in America to continue abusing gymnasts, to beat her by proxy:  if he lied to her father that she was lazy or some such, Bela knew her abusive old school father would do the beatings for him.<br /><br />The emotional abuse she received at the hands of the two of them as well as her own father made her unable to enjoy her hard won gold medal: she was deathly afraid of the disapproval of them all, with good reason.  They treated her horribly because she had fallen on vault.  After years of cruelty and forcing her to work out injured, and starving her, all of which her parents worked night and day to pay for, they tossed her like a used Kleenex after her fall.<br /><br />This kind of abuse gives the sport of gymnastics a terrible image.  What is wrong with the USAG that they keep these money-grubbing, cheap, mean Karolyis at the top of their hierarchy?  It is cognitive dissonance to read this very honest memoir and still to see the current Olympic selection going on with Marta at the top.  It makes me sick.<br /><br />Bravo for the lone voice trying to do something about this, the brave and honest Dominique Moceanu.  And I am enjoying her courage and her wonderful progress as I finish the book.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is highly addictive. I can't stop playing and I learn something new each time I play.  Need more games like this.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|everyone else says, &quot;it never uploads my photo...this app sucks!&quot; Well it works perfectly for me! To be honest this app is totally awesome! I love it!
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I Honestly wonder what these 1 star reviewers are smoking?This is by far the best rush album in over 20 years!(My first Rush album was Presto,Which had just come out at the time,A Highly underrated and masterful album,IMHO.)From the opening track\\"Caravan\\" To the stunningly beautiful\\"The garden\\",This the RUSH That  I have missed!! The songwriting is fantastic,And hearing geddy playing his old-school rolling basslines again put a smile on my face.Being a bass player myself,I Felt that Geddy was underutilizing his talent on the last 5 albums or so.Is it just me,Or do I hear Shades of \\"Signals\\" In this album?Hopefully,This isn't Rush's last album,But if it is,They're going out on top.A Much better album than it has any right being from a band 40 years and 20 albums into their career.They lost their fire for a while,But thankfully,They've found it again,And they're back,Amazingly,Better than ever.Long live RUSH!!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I have a new grandboy &amp; I can now cute up his photos.  I'm on a kindle fire &amp; it works great.  this app has lots of neat lil extras that you can do to photos ....... I got it free today but it would have been worth the $5 they was wanting.
B0073U2FB2|3.0|THE DARKEST HOUR is a sci-fi fantasy with an interesting premise but weak execution.  It manages to sustain interest in spite of its flaws.<br />Five young people visiting Moscow find themselves victims of a terrifying alien invasion that decimates the Russian metropolis.  They search desperately for other survivors while fending off these aliens who seem to generate electrical energy in their destructive path.<br />Special effects aren't very impressive and the pacing of the film is somewhat slow.  Emile Hirsh, Olivia Thirlby, Max Menghella, Rachael Taylor and Joel Kinnaman try gamely in their roles but they're more props than developed characters.  Some incredulous plot holes also diminish the storyline.<br />Overall, THE DARKEST HOUR is passable entertainment but doesn't set any new standards in sci-fi cinema.  For more credible apocalyptic cinema, check out THE DIVIDE.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it is. very good best thing is you do not have to wait for energy like other free games. I love the games
B004V98UKS|3.0|Basic puzzler but the penalty for restarting the level is dumb given the possibility of overstepping accidently due to touch screen. Games should be fun, not punishing.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Best free app for killing time I take it to the Dr.s office and never have to look at the clock waiting.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|It is ok but not the best game in the world I would pefer Temple Run ...........by the way Temple Run is free
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I normally read biographies and haunting books. Under the advice of my cousin, I read the whole series. I loved it! Everyone has their preference on what makes a good book. I am just happy I actually took my cousins advice and read this. Some people hated it, some found this boring, some loved it some thought, it was just good. I am hoping there are more to come in this series. This last book left me with unanswered questions and wanting more not from Ana's point of veiw but Christians. For someone who took a shot at writing this for the first time, I think E.L James did a wonderful job.
B00785P2QC|4.0|the game is a lot of fun but the prompts to purchase are annoying. it will be impossible to accomplish some goals without spending real money but fun if you don't mind that.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really thought this was going to be boring, but after a certain point this book got great. I am happy I bought this book, and happy with the whole series. I really do hope E.L James writes more to this. This is a series I know I will be reading over and over.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun app. takes awhile to get to the better games but its free.<br />you earn points by playing games and then use the points to unlock other games.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love it, for a person who never written a book in her life E.L James is wonderful. Everyone has their opinion this series of books and mine is nothing but thinking this a wonderful book. To me it was worth the price I paid for it and I love the characters. I really do hope there is more to come.
0060574216|5.0|I love this book! It explains a LOT about conflict between the sexes.<br /><br />For instance, did you know that women are more emotional and men are more rational? Maybe you did, but the author adds a confounding observation, namely that men also cannot control their emotions on the rare occasions they have them. It is definitely up to women, who--while pretty irrational overall, have better impulse control--to keep our hubbies from experiencing the kind of negative and detail oriented nagging we can be prone to.<br /><br />Recently I heard this author on a late night radio show typically devoted to alien conspiracies (just happened upon it thru a google for this brilliant psychotherapist) and I highly recommend this interview along with the book. Dr. Gray expounds on and expands his central thesis with the tragic observation that men in countries where feminism has actually taken hold (e.g., places like Scandinavia where women are paid equally, etc.) the women tend to be very derogatory and dismissive of men. This saddens dr. Gray because while men may not be in control of their emotions, able to communicate effectively, or interested in women except as, quote, mirrors of themselves, it is truly debilitating to men to be put down by women. To the point where it makes them cheat, leave, fail to pay child support, etc. They say it takes two to tango but really, it's usually our fault, fellow wives.<br /><br />He further noted that the father child relationship is primary to healthy child rearing, since moms (while necessary) tend to baby their children and fuss a lot. He doesn't mention the nasty menstruation thing, so I will (he is too much of a gentleman) but, ew. Every month, all I can think is \\"I'm so gross, curtains would be nice, don't leave me!\\" although that isn't much different from the rest of the time! I am so silly. But I think I have learned from this book how to solve so many of my relationship problems. Since I can't change my inborn biology and sincescience proves that I've evolved to gather tiny, tiny pieces of things and freak out when my family leaves my sight, I will need to learn to just hush up. I might need to see a doctor for medicine which will help--dr. Gray doesn't mention this, and I heard he's not actually a doctor, except he is a doctor of the heart.<br /><br />I have so much more praise for this book, but I already spent four hours writing this, and my boss will be mad if I don't get the coffee machine prepped for tomorrow nd write that pesky old memo (typing is hard) so gotta go. BUY THE BOOK LADIES, AND NEVER BE PUNCHED AGAIN (til you screw up).
B005LAIH3G|1.0|With all of the hype on this movie we were expecting more. It has good special effects, but just is not a good movie. Do not waste your money.
B003XI4LUQ|5.0|The movie was fun and entertaining.  It had a lot of action.  I liked it.  It as fun and action packed.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|My daughter asked me to download this one. We live in different states and this game gives us another way to stay connected! It's funny!
B003KJF2WE|5.0|It was fun and action packed.  I liked it a lot.  Good story line.  I love the green monster.  Marvel created another classic.
B007H7XJD4|1.0|I liked this move only slightly better when it was called Clash of the Titans. This was simply not good. It had poor story telling, bad editing and weak action. Not much going for it at all.
B00881VLCE|4.0|i really enjoy this app! i would  like more puzzles to do but it seems to keep me busy on those long boring work days. helps to keep the sleep away! nice work!
B005K17RU0|4.0|this is a beautiful app on tablet sized screens.  The daily and hourly forecasts are particularly striking.  The main downside is the radar maps.  Colors are washed out and a line of severe thunderstorms uses the same color  scheme as most others display snow, light blues and pinks.  Perhaps I am being lazy and overlooking some setting I can change, but it is my only complaint.  AccuWeather is my primary weather app, with weather bug being my severe storm radar app.
B0086700CM|4.0|its a huge amusement to my best friend. when she comes over all she does is grab my kindle and tries to beat her high score. I personly don't play much but when I do its fun for about five minuets. then I just exit out. this game is for somebody that loves the easy challenges of jumping or ducking.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Although this novel also talks about the supernatural, it veers away from the traditional mushy love story of Twilight and the childish fantasy of Harry Potter. The Discovery of Witches is adventurous, dangerous but at the same time sweet and witty. It is also very informative for those wanting to learn more about demons and witches. All in all this is an enchanting tale!
B004TFLYRA|5.0|This last in the series, and Anthony Horowitz's best work out of all of the stories. Since my son introduced me to them, I have virtually devoured all of the books in the Alex Rider series as soon as they were out and this one took only a few hours for me to read, it was so gripping. Darker than the others, it is a fitting end to a great story line.

B00785P2QC|3.0|The game in and of itself is ok for a time killer. However, that being said, the continual requests to post to FaceBook went beyond redundancy to flat irritating.
1400032717|5.0|My daughter was required to read this book for one of her summer reads. She LOVED it and couldn't put it down. After the first couple of pages she was pulled in wanting to know what happened next. It has also made her want to learn more about the autistic person. SHE SAID THIS WAS ONE AWESOME BOOK!
B007OWG3LM|2.0|Mann!!! I was expecting so much more from SR after their million year long hiatus. Come on guys where is the original Sigur Ros that I totally fell in love with? The haunting \\"hooks\\" from songs such as Agaetis Byrjun, Olsen Olsen and the hard hitting audio meltdown in  Glosoli or the beautiful motifs in Hoppipolla seemed to have been lost in time forever. In their previous albums such as AB and Takk and even (somewhat) in Untitled, Sigur Ros was coming across as a band with strong melodic content that was diverse and very well structured. It brought to surface a certain song-writing prowess that set them apart from every other \\"ambient\\" or (worse still) post-rock outfit. It was because Sigur Ros was anything BUT a part of those strangely defined genres. Sigur Ros was....well Sigur Ros. Their songs had an ambient yet very intricately layered structure and through it all, very strong melodic themes seeped through.<br /><br />But with this latest effort, I feel very disappointed. EVERY song sounds almost the same. This is massage parlor music guys. What the heck?!?! I understand that a band goes through crests and troughs of moods and creative spells and that their sound evolves. But this is not evolution, this feels like laziness and a certain lack of commitment toward good song writing in spite of taking quite a few years off from the band. Valtari sounds like baby bed time music. Which might not be a bad thing for maybe parents who want to expose their babies to good bands right from a very early age. But for me, this just doesn't do it. I've heard this album more than a few times now and I just fail to understand why Sigur Ros would make songs that have minimal to zero impact emotionally and thematically. Every song is easily forgettable. There is not one song on this album that stands out and something that I would be humming much later after having listened to it. Valtari has each song laid out in this sort of a bland theme wherein there are violins and vocal hymns in the backdrop with certain chimes and wind instrument and Jonsi singing a similar sounding melody in his usual monotonous style in EVERY song. Heck I am a musician and I could make this entire album using presets from Omnisphere and be done with it in a week's time.<br /><br />Guys I don't mean to be insulting, but after being such a loyal fan and waiting for so long for a new album by Sigur Ros (not Jonsi solo, not boy meets girl or Alex and whoever....I am talking purely Sigur Ros), when I get something like Valtari, it feels like some left over crumbs just got thrown my way. At this point I do not want to assume that this is the direction SR wants to head in and I truly hope its not the case but unfortunately I just cannot recommend Valtari as a good, fulfilling purchase.<br /><br />In the end here is what I have to say to round up this review: If you are a new listener wanting to enter the world of Sigur Ros I would strongly recommend Agaetis Byrjun, Takk or even Med Sud because if you start with Untitled or Valtari you could develop a warped sense of assessment of SR's music. For me personally their more musically active stuff feels much more satisfying and truly unparalleled. But Valtari and Untitled seem very monotonous and indistinguishable and that qualifies for an album to start getting played in massage parlors and acupuncture clinics. Why does Valtari still get 2 stars and not one? Its because I believe that this band is one of its kind. There is no other that can match SR in their genius of song writing and coming up with themes that are very intense & rich. And even musically within Valtari there is a lot going on purely in terms of sounds. But in the end a song is not just a collection of sounds and layers, it is an overall package. And the overall SONGS are what seriously lack color & soul in Valtari. A minor exception being Flogur Piano. Listen to that when compared to the rest of the album and compare that song to some of their older songs andyou will know exactly what I am talking about.
B00846REIS|4.0|As a long time romance reader the flaws in 50 Shades of Grey far outweighed the story. I'm actually appalled that it has gotten so popular when it is so poorly written. I took a chance on Bared to You based on a reader's review who said it was 50 Shades all fixed up.<br /><br />Wow! Ms. Day did a great job of \\"fixing\\" 50 Shades. I think it's probably the nature of an author to take a story and make it their own; fixing problems along the way. Ms. Day did this. I also think the fact that she has several books under her belt was a serious benefit. I loved the characters. The story line was much less flawed and the characters personalities were better matched. The book was also well-written, a HUGE plus for me.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this book 4 stars was because the whole idea of dominant/submissives was brought up about three-quarters through the book. It felt forced and just didn't seem to fit the story Ms. Day wove. I was disappointed it was brought up and thought it was unnecessary to the story-line. Maybe Ms. Day thought she needed that connection to 50 Shades or maybe an editor insisted but it was a mistake in my opinion.<br /><br />Overall, a really great read. I hope it is as successful as 50 Shades.
B0086700CM|5.0|fun &amp; addicting game. it's fun and entertaining for all ages. My kids fight over my kindle fire to play temple run!

B006PHD0RW|5.0|I love this game! I get tired of games after awhile but I keep coming back to this one. I like that you can go to different parts and the goal is different for each. great game.

B0086700CM|4.0|Need to see more games like this for Kindle. Fun and fairly addictive. First found/tried on my phone, and enjoy it much more on the larger screen.
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close captures and distills so many truths into such a poignant and honest story that it will likely leave you enthralled, contemplating its message and characters for days.<br /><br />The story opens up with a father-of-the-year type dad played by Hanks who tries his hardest to be available to his son, who obviously has some sort of sensing and/or anxiety disorder. The boy is afraid of all kinds of things, but nothing so much as people.<br /><br />Upon his father's passing, the boy ignores his mother and pursues a fantasy-esque grand quest to find the lock which his father's mysterious key will open. His purpose is simple:  he wants to continue to hold onto his father's memory. Not just a remembrance, but a true memory, like he is there. The boy must face every fear he has to even begin his mission, but for his father, he'll do anything.<br /><br />The boy's journey is where the movie shines. His hardships, his ability to overcome himself, his enduring love for his father and his interactions with the dozens of hurting people throughout New York City are captivating and heart-chord strumming.<br /><br />If you enjoy emotional stories that deal this love, death and growth, then you will surely like this film as well. It is something truly unique and special in the milieu of over-done film plaguing the industry.<br /><br />A final word of technical caution:  We watched this on a standard definition TV, widescreen DVD. Due to a certain character, we had to regularly pause and zoom to read what that character was writing. I would caution against watching the film on a standard definition TV if you want to see it in widescreen format if you do not want to do the same.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is a fun game. the game is cool.u should get because it fun to play on. any child can play this game.
B005QUQP76|4.0|I have used my Razer Deathadder for years.  I loved the mouse.  However, the left mouse button lost its responsiveness and after taking it apart it was just never the same.  I thought about just purchasing another one, but it is about 5 years old at this point so I figured I'd invest in a bit of a newer technology.<br /><br />The feel of this mouse is superb.  I love the gritty feel of the sides.  The top is your standard rubberized coating feel but the sides have a near sandpaper-like feel to them.  It isn't abrasive and makes for a nice grip.  The buttons have a short travel on them to click and the mouse wheel is nice and large.  The software isn't as bad as people make it out to be, but it still is in beta so it should still improve.<br /><br />One of the main draws of the mouse is the sniper button - and actually it's a really cool feature.  I play on the middle DPI setting and clicking the sniper button drops it to the lowest so you can move in a little slower.  The only drawback is I cannot figure out how to hold the mouse in order to use the button.  I have average sized hands and the only way to comfortably grip the mouse where your thumb rests over the sniper button is to have my palm on the mouse.  This is fine and dandy, however then I have to use a claw grip which doesn't really go with having your palm down.  This results in having to move your arm instead of just your hand and it applies way too much pressure on the mousepad for it to be comfortable.  If the sniper button was back an inch or so it would have saved it from losing a star.<br /><br />Besides the odd placement of the sniper button, which I really wont put to much use anyway, the mouse is great.  The build quality is awesome with the aluminum chassis.  All of the buttons feel \\"right\\" to click.  Adjustable weights, high DPS, braided cable - it has everything a quality gaming mouse should have.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game. it is so fun. my son likes to help me guess my friends' drawings. this app is awesome!
B004132HZS|5.0|Finally a show that everyone in the family enjoys. We love this show. It is funny, witty, a modern-day, but authentic, take on Sherlock Holmes. It's got the family reading the original, too. The best rendition ever.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|Omg! I don't understand why everyone walks around with like Angry Birds shirts and stuffed animals. This game isn't even that fun. It gets old after a while and its a little addicting but everyone just gets mad if they cant beat the level!!!!

B00005N6KG|5.0|I am a home improvment contractor & wear the headphones under my hat. Have been buying these headphones for years. The sound for music is great & they are priced very well. Three (3)keys: the flip of one finger can remove from both ears to talk to workers or customers, can hear outside noises, & don't look like a geek when using. Thank you Sony (per usual) for making a great product, but can't buy in brick & motar stores anymore.

B00571F26Y|5.0|I heard about this book from two well known media people. I have been wheat free for four weeks and I have lost 12 pounds.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|I am a HUGE fan of historical/period/costume dramas; so after viewing the trailer online, I knew this would be something I would be interested in!<br />Having already seen \\"Mrs. Brown\\" (starring Dame Judi Dench, and Bill Connolly), and \\"Victoria & Albert\\" (starring Victoria Hamilton, and Jonathan Firth- yes, Colin Firth's brother)- I already knew a little history of H.M. Queen Victoria.<br /><br />Despite a couple of inaccuracies (such as Albert being shot), I still found the film very enjoyable.<br />This was only the 2nd film I had seen either of the two leads in.<br />Emily Blunt in \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\", and Rupert Friend in \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" 2005. Being that both of those roles were only supporting characters at best, I guess I wasn't sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised though, to see both of them shine in their roles (Emily especially)!!<br /><br />My only complaint is that it was over too soon! (But since the title is \\"The YOUNG Victoria\\"- I guess it stands to reason.) If you're interested in learning more, I would recommend viewing the two films I mentioned earlier. As others have commented, the cinematography was beautifully done; the locations, and costumes are breathtaking! Also, it's only got a PG rating!!
B005O71C8I|5.0|love,love,love this series specially barney and the fact that you can buy the episodes before they hits the stores is a plus, love it!!!

B007JCP962|3.0|I've been a huge Mars Volta fan ever since I saw them open for the Chili Peppers in the early 2000's. I've enjoyed every release the've put out, especially the first four albums. With Octahedron (their last cd) and Noctourniquet, they have definitely been trying to appeal to a wider audience, as these albums are generally not as weird as their older stuff.  But, with the loss of their explosive drummer, Thomas Pridgeon, and their keyboardist as well as contributions from John Frusciante, Noctourniquet can't even keep up the with their most tame record, Octahedron. The more electronic sound they went for on this album is just boring compared to their older, chaotic masterpieces and the new drummer is nothing compared to every drummer they've had in the past. Also, I read that the leaders of the group, vocalist, Cedric and guitarist/producer, Omar, were in constant disagreement and hardly even spoke to one another during the production of this cd. For this reason and the drastic personnel change of the rest of the band members, Noctourniquet is certainly the worst record in the Mars Volta catalogue, but it still is the Mars Volta, so it's at least somewhat good.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|minor panic as my player not encoded for uk product (1st time buyer, not sure if this happens all the time!), so would not play. had to decode player, quality thus far excellent
B0051UP5NQ|2.0|I bought it to create notes while on a trip and needed wireless document creation. In the product's defense, 1) I did not test other features or usefulness, and 2) I should have been sophisticated enough to figure out that I could not create offline docs before I bought it. The response to my question regarding offline storage was \\"The OfficeSuite allows saving files only on SD card and not on device memory.\\" I am posting this so anyone else not too familiar with such apps will not make the same mistake.  Can't get my money back, of course.

B007D2XSW0|5.0|I am a kindle fire User and I had no problems. I liked it. It has a lot of options and it let me use my gallery pics. I am so glad it was free or else I would have never downloaded it. Great for kindle fire!
B007D2XSW0|4.0|I down loaded this app because it was the free app of the day. I was surprised by how much this app has to offer. I like the autofix for brightness and I contrast. It gas some cool filters and lets you choose what frame to use.<br /><br />I have a little trouble with setting the focus on a picture. It feels like the feature shifts the blur to another part of the image. It may just be me though.

B003R4ZMJU|5.0|I really love this show and this is coming from a guy! It is so suspencful and its not the typical highschool teenage drama show like Gossip Girl and 90210. What i find really good about this show is how original it is. It has an original storyline which leaves the audience on various cliff-hangers each episode. To say this show is amazing doesn't give it justice. Highly reconmend to anyone. Also, all the girls in the cast are really hot, especially Aria :)
B005LAIGN2|1.0|Very disappointed in Red Tails.  The movie tried and failed to clone \\"Airmen of Tuskegee\\".<br />Don't waste your time w/ Red Tails as it has very little substance to it. Go see the earlier version and no doubt you will enjoy  it 10x's over.
B000NQRE9Q|1.0|I do not understand why do you have this video advertised and not have an available date and even a picture cover. Very poorly done. Nobody will be interested in purchasing your collection this way.
B000UD08HW|2.0|The music and performance were flawless.  Simply sublime!  This disc will definitely show off your Dolby TrueHD and make your ears happy.  Crank it up and enjoy!<br /><br />The video, however, was perhaps the worst concert footage I've EVER seen.  The lighting may have worked great for a live event, but it was absolutely wrong for video.  A very large percentage of this concert is completely un-watchable. The stage is washed out in blues and reds.  You can't see much of anything most of the time.  Filming this concert was obviously an after thought.  It had the potential to be so great, but it goes down as an \\"epic fail\\".<br /><br />This is one DVD or Blu-ray that is best enjoyed as audio only.  Turn off the projector or tv and just put on your headphones and slip into audio ecstasy.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|alAbgry birds space is very fun and addictive. Although it is also very easy. everything time a new level comes out I'll finish it within an hour.

B003XF1XOQ|1.0|If you absolutely loved the first two, don't waste your time on this one. Disapointed me so much, and at the end I just felt ripped off by Collins. She seriously owes me 2 days of my life back that I could have spent reading much better books. And she owes me back the money I spent on this pure let-down of a finale. That's all I'm going to say because this book doesn't deserve me spending my precious time reviewing it, honestly.
B0055X65JC|1.0|almost every place we visited was no longer in business.  After only 2 years, this book was completely out of date.  check the blogs that the author gives in the beginning of the book for current information before you actually spend a tank of gas driving to places that are not there.

1934609625|4.0|Hide My Eyes by Margery Allingham is a neat little psychological thriller about a serial killer in London's neighborhood of Garden Green. Allingham's usual protagonists, Albert Campion and Charlie Luke, appear sporadically throughout the plot but nonetheless, play a pivotal role at the end of the mystery.<br /><br />The story concerns seemingly unrelated killings. First, a bus is used to transport a body from the scene. In the bus is an old couple who appear to be asleep.  In addition, a couple who are traveling to South Africa disappear. In another incident, some jewelry from an unsolved crime turns up. Charlie Luke feels that the crimes are all connected.<br /><br />While Campion and Luke appear sporadically in the tale, the narration is mostly from the murderer's viewpoint and the viewpoints of young Annabelle Tassie and Richard Waterfield. Annabelle has come to London by invitation of her Aunt Polly, whom she has never met. She contacts her childhood friend, Richard who has taken a job in London, so that he can keep an eye out for her. Richard immediately falls under the spell of Annabelle who has bloomed into a breathtaking beauty.<br /><br />Richard and Annabel are the true main characters in this book. Richard's adventures with the murderer whom he has met at Aunt Polly's provide the main backstory in this thriller.<br /><br />This is a disturbing look into the mind of a sociopath who believes he has provided himself with rock solid alibis while committing mayhem.<br /><br />\\"Hide My Eyes\\" (also published as \\"Tether's End\\") is highly recommended.
0670023329|5.0|If you're looking for something to read before you go to sleep at night, this isn't it.  The last time I was hit this hard was many years ago when I read The Diary of Ann Frank.<br /><br />This is a look at what happens when a country loses its focus and begins to think of people as replaceable parts in a piece of machinery known as the state.  The book, Brave New World, warns us about this type of society but it was only fiction.  This is the real thing.<br /><br />How this young man came through this unbearable life by escaping through an electrified fence and how he found us through a maze of people, places and things he could not possibly understand proves how endurable the human life really is.  The end of the book talks about his inability to fuse together his past life and his present and has left him with fear and depression.<br /><br />I hope that enough people will read this and try to understand what trauma really is.  I wish him the very best in life, he certainly deserves to at last be at peace and find happiness.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|At around 4am Friday morning i started to read Beautiful Disaster by Jaime McGuire..WOW!!! This book is none stop crazy laughter, suspense, tears, heartache, tears, fear, lots of love and passion and so much pain...a \\"Beautiful Disaster\\" in every sense! LOVED IT!!
B00899DR40|2.0|For all intensive purposes this is an extremely lacklustre recording. The lyrics range from inocuous to vacuous. The hype is just that. Who would have ever thuoght that the whore of Babylon would be an immature and pretentious Canadian juvenile. The only thing Believe has going for it is an incredibly overwrought marketing campaign. And as for beebz live performances as of late, it strikes me quite curious that when his hands frequently brush against or bump into his attached head mic that there isn't the slightest audible sound of said brushing or bumping, not to mention the camera pull aways when its obvious his mouth motion is out of sync with the vocals being heard....
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I started these books just to see what all the fuss was about.  I was lost in the story, I couldn't put it down.  I didn't know if I wanted Ana to run as far and fast from Christian as she could or hope that they could get something worked out so they could actually have a relationship.  After reading all three all I can say is wow!  I really enjoyed them and hope that the author adds another book to their story.
B004KKX80A|1.0|i ordered this beyblade and i waited so much time to get it only to realize that it was a fake flea market version, plus, it didn't have the tip it said an the back, just two tip that didn't even fit.next time i want to know were its coming from. i wanted a real one, not a counterfeit.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|I started reading this, just because I was curious about all of the fuss associated with it.  Is it supposed to be so funny?  Ana is too naive to be believable and Christian takes freak to a level I haven't seen since \\"9 and a half weeks\\".  I enjoyed the references to Tess of the D'urbervilles however, and decided to revisit that book as a result of attempting to read this one, so I guess it wasn't a total loss.
0812550706|5.0|FANTASTIC BOOK!<br />This is coming from a guy who doesn't read much. Bought the rest of the series the moment I finish the book!
0817439390|5.0|This book is great for learning the basics of Exposure. Anyone who is starting out in Photography should read this book just to get in the swing of things. I wish I would have had this book on hand when I first started out. It breaks down Exposure down and tells how to creatively use aperture and shutter speed to get a creatively correct exposure. If you have been taking pictures for a while and are shooting in Manual mode already this book may not be as much help for you, but if your still shooting in automatic I would highly recommend you reading this book as I know it has helped me!
B007R41E8O|4.0|Fun game!  Good graphics at a good price. Only reason I'm not rating it a 5 is because they're pushing for a rating too early in the game.
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|I'd just like to start off this review by saying that no life is insignificant and while it's perfectly fine to disagree with the way someone lives their life, no one has the right nor the authority to deem someone a \\"waste\\". Everyone has a right to their opinion but there's this little thing called tact that people seem to forget every now and then.<br /><br />This movie was amazing. I can't really find the words to describe how it made me feel and the immediate connection I had to this boy. I don't think he was a spoiled brat at all, I think he was so desperate to find himself that he was willing to go bush in order to do it. How many people can say they abandoned their lives in pursuit of adventure and how many people secretly want to but will never find the courage to do so? I don't know if I will ever find the courage to and I'm not sure if I would go about it the way he did but I admire him for his bravery. I think he did a beautiful thing.

Again a great book, you will not be disappointed.
B004G6TD4S|5.0|A replacement copy purchased dependably from Amazon.<br />The technology & talent hold up after many, many years.<br />Simply one of the best - certainly among the most talented & innovative.<br />Sound quality is superb.<br />Witnessed ELP @ the Charlotte Speedway, had to be about 1975 or there about.  Left me awe stricken & still speechless - no words adequate to describe the performance.

B003AVPV1O|5.0|Great stuff. I ordered a vga splitter, a 20-feet vga cable and a 10-feet computer power cord and the quality of all those products were excellent. It's definitely better and cheaper than the ones you get at regular computer supply stores.
B000JJCQ68|3.0|The shipping was fast, but this movie is so long, the DVD is double-sided. The center was cracked when I received it, so only the 2nd half of the movie plays. Good thing I've already seen the entire movie.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|Super entretenidad! Siempre en movimiento y la mas emotiva de las peliculas. Entendi muchas cosas con esa pelicula! LOV ITTT
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I like this game but the games are just stupid. They seem easy but are kinds hard which frustrates me.
B000274THQ|5.0|A cute movie that is both comic and poignant. Set around the time of German reunification in 1989-1990, it chronicles the exploits of two adult children who try to keep the news of the fall of East Germany from their devoted Socialist mother.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|I have always had a hard time getting much rest at all. I would probably get maybe a total hours rest each night for the last twenty years. I saw this app and thought maybe it would just let me relax at night and so I bought it. I was so surprised when I fell asleep to it. It was the first real nights rest I have had in so long. I have used it every night since. Thankyou!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Fiendishly clever thriller; it sucks you in from the beginning and doesn't let you go. It isn't often that a thriller surprises me, but I didn't see this one coming. Don't expect to do anything else once you start reading. Enjoy!
B005HEVBN4|5.0|I cheated a little to bring up the average score, but I must say this episode is almost as good as any of them.

1466401885|5.0|After reading twilight I had a hard time finding a book that could really catch my attention and this was it!!!! I think I have read this book legit like 25 times and i still get chills the story line is great and you begin to route for the guy that probaly dont derseve the girl but deep down inside you cant help it.... This book keeps you on your toes and you need to buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005HEWEN0|5.0|This episode might put off some people esp. if you don't care for neelix. I like it due to the somewhat more 'believable' personal struggle between neelix and the alien doctor who is his enemy. It is an enjoyable episode in the Voyager series.
0345803485|2.0|well i decided to read this book because all my friends were at the time reading it. Keep in mind that my friends and I are all in high school .But after getting not even half way through the book I was annoyed at why Ana would stay with a guy like that. A person who abused her mentally and phyiscally told what to do when to eat he was controling and that's not a healthy relationship. And belive me i get that all book cant be happy and fariytale like but when you are creating a book thats is read by all group of people and different age groups and mainly women it  in some way seems as if the auother is okay with woman or anyone being treat in such manner. But another thing that was quite annoying was that you never found out why Christian didnt like to be touch or what his emotional bagges was it just a frustrating book all around because it make you wanna read the next to found what his issuses were my advice is dont read it will just huant you really....
0345803493|1.0|This book was eye-gougingly painful to read.  I wanted to like the trilogy, but NOTHING exciting or new ever happened.  Christian Gray has a \\"Red Room of Pain\\" and nothing exciting was developed.  Just unrealistic orgasms that happened with a mere touch or look.  I recommend skipping this book and getting some romance paperback with Fabio and some swooning lady with cascading hair.  Guarantee that will be better than this book.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It reminds you often of the importance of God's word in our daily lives. This app also allows for so many different ways to study the Bible. I absolutely love it.
0375703764|1.0|Many reviews giving this book a low rating have put it much better than I can. What I do wish to say however,  is that this book misses many key ingredients. For one, it is not scary. Perhaps it has never claimed to be but it still did little to convey any sense of an atmosphere at all.<br /><br />The characters are paper thin with no amiable qualities, and bad language seems to be scatterd around simply to help achieve the author's attempt at a dark tone. Along with Johnny's invlovement with drugs, his abusive foster father, his job as a tattoo artist and his lust for, yep, a stripper. I will not argue that these - though cliche- characteristics could happen but it all feels a bit shallow.<br /><br />I bought this book because I loved the idea of finding 'easter eggs' and having to do some additional thinking, uncovering the plot by reading between the lines both metaphorically and literally but it is not as cleverly intertwined as you hope for. Or as other readers have made out. Infact it feels neither intertwined nor clever...just pretentious.<br /><br />I hope people see this book for what it is, badly written. You can throw in all these bells and whistles but at the end of the day, you must have an intriguing, interesting plot and compelling characters. Its a well iced cake but he forgot to put the eggs in.
B004EQAVHI|2.0|This film started off well.  Many questions were raised and I looked forward to watching the answers unfold.  However, the film became more and more flimsy and unbelievable.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert<br /><br />I don't mean the sci-fi premise - I had no trouble imagining that.  I mean all the plot holes.  For example, the children must scan a bracelet as they pass from place to place.  Their movements seem very controlled and limited in other ways as well.  They have been told scary stories about the world outside the gates of their school, so that they are terrified of going out of bounds.  At 18, however, they are sent to cottages to live together with no adult supervision and no boundaries whatsoever.  They go wherever they choose and stay as long as they like.  But we still have a scene of the teens reentering the cottage and scanning their bracelets at the door. (The theme of the bracelets that monitor movements is not original.  It is taken directly from Ira Levin's \\"This Perfect Day.\\")<br /><br />Another inconsistency:  at the school we are shown the extremely careful monitoring of the children's health.  This seems to be a major concern.  But then, at 18, they live in unsupervised conditions, with no one safeguarding their well being or health at all.<br /><br />Worst of all is the character's incomprehensible passivity.  They seem to be resigned to their fate with an almost bovine acceptance.  I kept wondering why they don't walk away, run away, refuse, anything but this dull resignation.  We see donors going to their deaths with unreal calmness.  This strains credulity way too far.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|This proves once again why you can never trust the critics. I don't know what they were expecting, but this movie was great.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I agree with other reviewers that this book is deemed to be a classic!  I have read every book by Arthur C Clarke, Isaac Asimov, and Clifford D Simak, my favorite 3 SF authors and this series dovetails right with them in terms of writing talent, story-telling, characters, and excitement.  I have read the book over the past two days and literally could hardly put it down .<br /><br />Highly Recommended !
B005K17RU0|4.0|great app tot a weather geek. I love the radar!! Love the hazardous weather warnings.  Inclusion of a satellite/cloud view would make the app a 5star.
0345803507|2.0|I literally fell in love with both characters during 50 Shades of Grey and 50 Shades Darker and read through both books within a week's time.  I simply could not put them down and each evening I looked forward to picking up where I left off.<br /><br />Unfortunately, 50 Shades Freed's story lines didn't seem to flow like the others.  In fact, I found myself rereading and even skipping some pages.  On one occasion, I even questioned myself if perhaps my glass of wine was affecting my reading.  LOL!<br /><br />Seriously, it wasn't the wine!!  I think E.L. James lost her magic on 50 Shades Freed. I'm all for happily ever after, but the ending of the book went from rated X to G.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book is deemed to be a classic! I have read the book over the past two days and literally could hardly put it down. I couldn't stop reading this book, so I spend a day tired at work - just because I wanted to one more page (and one more, and one more).<br /><br />Howey's writing is rich with texture and feeling, making this an effortless read. He manages to demonstrate differing viewpoints in a way that feels balanced but not undecided, giving clearly despicable individuals believable justifications for their actions. It's impossible to know what you, as the reader, might do in any of the characters' shoes.<br /><br />Highly Recommended !
B0079XNWQA|3.0|I purchased the cd for the song,I wont give up. Besides that song,I like a couple others. Either the other songs will grow on me or I'll just be happy listening to the one song. I received this cd very quickly. Thanks for the promptness of delivery.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book has a difficult start for some, but the story line is amazing. It is a great lead to Fifty Shades Darker. Very kinky...avoid if you are conservative.
B005LAII08|2.0|Brother bear in 3d.<br /><br />Pros<br />1. Great music and animation.<br />2. Humorous at times.<br /><br />Cons<br />1. Original? \\"Brother bear\\" in 3D?<br />2. Story.Weak.<br /><br />Conclusion.<br /><br />Great animation.Not a Pixar quality.
B00813HP7E|5.0|Am hooked. Well written, the story lines are good and so is the acting. I like the connection between the storybook story and the present day story. Well done
B002ZG97RY|4.0|Regardless of the facts of the film, it still draws attention to the real fact that there were no WMDs in Iraq and that the U.S. people were lied to, repeatedly.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|great golf game lots of fun great time killer you need a little skill to complete alot of the levels
B007SYWFRM|5.0|if you are looking for something free and entertaining here is the game for you! I love and play it a lot its easy to figure out and fairly easy to gain levels!
0345803507|5.0|A lot of people have put these books down which sadens me a bit. With that said I really enjoyed reading all of them but this one in peticular is the best. In the first book I found myself hating Mr. Grey. And telling Ana to run for the hills, by the second I understood him a lot better as well as her, and by the third well I had to slow down on the page turning because I didn't want it to come to an end. And I was sad when it did. I can't speak for everyone but this book is by a far one of my all time favorites, it touched a place deep in my soul and I am looking forward to the movie. For a first time writer James was wonderful and I do hope she continues to write in the future. I loved these books and I hope you do as well.
B0086700CM|5.0|best game on the kindle fire i would have bought it if it costed 5 99 good game awsome game
0345529057|5.0|I don't know why there are some bad reviews of this product. The book itself is amazing, the quality looks brand new, the pages are all in order, the price is amazing, and the shipping was quicker then I had expected. Great Product!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Woop!<br />This is a really good Bible App. I wish you didn't need to have Wifi though. What else can I say. Its God's best-seller! :)
B007I2BZIE|5.0|OK. First, I am an amateur audiophile. I majored in music and spent two years in college miking and mixing live bands at the soundboard for the college TV station. So my ears hear everything - the great to the terrible - sometimes my brain is independent of my ears, wanting so much to love Rush's Vapor Trails in 2002. I spent a week trying to tweak my new 5.1 surround sound system, thinking I had it set wrong, before I started to see the complaints online regarding the HORRID production on Vapor Trails. Alex said one thing at the time - the band had pushed past digital 0 into distortion during recording - then we heard nothing about it from Rush until last year, when Alex confirmed they were NEVER happy with the production on VT, but, to my sheer delight, that the album IS being remixed and remastered. There will be no re-recording, but they will fix it in mastering where they can. Oh happy day for this Rush fan of 30+ years!<br /><br />Why the above commentary? Because I have read many reviews here about the \\"horrible\\" or \\"awful\\" *insert your favorite adjective* sound quality on Clockwork Angels. While I agree the sound quality is not always stellar, it is nowhere NEAR what VT was! However, everybody's opinion is correct with their reviews of CA, because listening to music is a subjective thing. Many of us are musicians, many of us are Rush fans. And, we are all equal as Rush fans. I was not a fan of Snakes and Arrows. I prefer my Rush to rock - my favorite albums being Permanent Waves, Moving Pictures, and Counterparts (minus Stick It Out - sorry Rush fans). All 3 have been tied for first place, depending on my mood. So after not really enjoying S&A, I approached this new album with a tentative \\"we will see.\\" I liked the first three songs, Caravan, BU2B, and especially Headlong Flight, well enough to download ahead of the album's release. Then I read some reviews, and downloaded the entire album to my iPod Video 5.5, which has great sound quality having the original Wolfson sound chip. I listened through my Koss PortaPro headphones (yes, these are quite awesome :-). I did hear some issues with overlaying of guitars and muddy guitars, especially during the song \\"Clockwork Angels.\\" But I loved ALL these songs SO much. So knowing the CD would sound better (comparing the download of MP3's AAC quality vs Apple Lossless Encoder upload to iPod), I bought that too. I listened first through my Sony CD portable and high quality Sennheiser headphones. Ah-Ha! I could hear much more, but there was still room for improvement, so next I listened through my regular system with B&W speakers, and also through my Harmon Kardon amp with the Sennheisers. Either way, double Ah-Ha! I could hear EVERYTHING that was important to me. Oh major happy delight! What an unbelievable great album Rush has given us with Clockwork Angels. There are no throwaway tracks; I hardly notice that 66 minutes have gone by listening from start to finish. My favorite song at the moment is \\"Seven Cities of Gold\\" with that great rock riff that makes my head bop - reminding me of my other favorite band, Porcupine Tree, and their work from 2002 and 2005. If you've ever seen Steven Wilson rocking out, hair bopping in his face, that's me listening to \\"Seven Cities.\\" Sheer DELIGHT. I love the ballads just as much, however, \\"Halo Effect\\" and the much mentioned \\"The Garden,\\" which may be the best ballad Rush has ever done. I love the pop hooks of \\"The Wreckers.\\" Frankly, the entire album, with the added storyline from Neil, is such a joy to listen to - I've probably listened about 20 times now!<br /><br />My advice is to listen to this album on the best equipment you can. I trashed my iPod MP3 album; it just doesn't compare to the broadness and clarity I hear with the CD and better sound equipment. If you can, get a pair of quality headphones - find out what sounds better to YOU - because that's what is most important. And for everyone it will be different. We Rush fans tend toover-analyze their albums at times, but it's only because we care SO much about the music, and hold it all so dear. I thank you Rush - for your 40 years of brilliant musicianship and great albums. Clockwork Angels has been added to my favorite 3 Rush albums of all time, so now there are 4, with Clockwork Angels edging near the very top.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love it. its too easy to get addicted to it and its too hard to put down. hope you have fun playing
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I've had this app about a year on my phone and I used it for everything.  Grocery lists, to-do lists, gift lists, music and books I want.  I recently got it for my Kindle Fire and liked it even more because I can sync between my phone and Fire so I never forget what I need.  I color code my notes so they are easy to tell apart.  You can also make them as a checklist so if you touch an item it crosses it out.  Highly recommended!

B0072GPQNG|1.0|Insufferably smarmy, unceasingly saccharine, incredibly cloying and hopelessly overlong (by at least 30 minutes) film version of the very spare (and very moving, at times) Broadway hit of the same name -- arguably Steven Spielberg's biggest misfire since the similarly-cloying, saccharine and smarmy \\"Always\\", \\"Amistad\\" and, more recently, Spielberg's (truly interminable)\\"The Terminal\\". A much more apt title for this film would be \\"The 100 Years War Horse\\" (because it seems to take that long for the film to finally end) ... a truly-misguided effort from start to finish that makes numerous, glaringly-obvious references to dozens of truly great films -- everything from \\"My Friend Flicka\\", \\"Gone With the Wind\\" and \\"Far From the Madding Crowd\\", to \\"National Velvet\\", \\"The Quiet Man\\" and \\"Paths Of Glory\\" -- without ever even just ONCE momentarily approaching greatness itself.<br /><br />Unrelenting stall fodder... :(  D-
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Thank you for this informative book.  I'm using it step by step to help me produce a book I'm writing for Kindle.  Very easy to follow and inspiring.  Great guide.
B005LAIGRS|5.0|I would be extremely surprised if Swedish-born director Daniel Espinosa (he made 2010's superb thriller, \\"Easy Money\\" -- among others) hasn't watched and re-watched and then re-watched again the justly-celebrated films of writer-director Michael Mann (particularly \\"Thief\\", \\"Manhunter\\", \\"Miami Vice\\", \\"Public Enemies\\" and, most notably, \\"Heat\\") because this terrific, no-holes-barred 2012 thriller definitely calls to mind those seriously kick-ass awesome Mann movies -- ones that are, at once, both incredibly beautiful (i.e., the cinematography and the camerawork), but also rather ugly as well at times (i.e., the emotional and physical violence in them) -- as well as a number of similarly-terrific 1970s-era \\"paranoid\\" thrillers (such as \\"Parallax View\\", \\"Black Sunday\\", \\"Marathon Man\\", \\"Twilight's Last Gleaming\\", \\"The Wilby Conspiracy\\", and perhaps most pointedly, \\"Three Days Of the Condor\\").<br /><br />(It also happily tips its hat more than once to Stanley Kramer's 1959 classic, \\"The Defiant Ones\\").<br /><br />Much like 1973's CIA-oriented \\"Three Days Of the Condor\\", Espinosa's South African-set drama involves a dupe who doesn't KNOW that he's a dupe -- Redford in \\"Condor\\"; an Oscar-worthy Ryan Reynolds here in \\"Safe House\\") -- and who eventually finds a verrrry unlikely ally (Faye Dunaway in \\"Condor\\"; Denzel Washington in \\"Safe House\\"), two men working for a government agency that both of them once trusted, but who no longer do (and probably very wisely so, as it turns out).<br /><br />However, what makes \\"Safe House\\" REALLY stand out from \\"Condor\\", particularly, are the dazzling/jaw-dropping action sequences that deft screenwriter David Guggenheim and director Espinsosa intersperse throughout this relentless and extremely tense, two-hour drama. There's a superbly-staged car chase in Cape Town, a rooftop foot chase in a Johannesburg shanty town, and a number of hand-to-hand fighting sequences that are among the most believable (and, by extension, among the most gruesome) of any I've seen anytime recently in a mainstream Hollywood release ... all of which may at least partly explain why \\"Safe House\\" was such a huge, unqualified hit, not only in the U.S., but in the rest of the world as well (dazzling action set pieces tend to quite easily transcend language barriers).<br /><br />But \\"Safe House\\" is also, at times, surprisingly MOVING as well -- which I think is another reason why this very smart and well-executed drama stayed with me longggg after I first it in a theater this past winter. There's a very palpable and powerful emotional gravity that runs throughout this movie, one that you almost never find in a big-budget Hollywood movie with this many dazzling action sequences in it (Michael Bay could definitely learn A LOT from Espinosa!!)<br /><br />Ultimately, \\"Safe House\\" is a movie about the truly destructive nature of lies -- what they do to those of us who tell them ... and also what they do to those of us who are on the receiving end of them. Government officials around the globe would do well to heed this film's cautionary tale.<br /><br />Sumptuous cinematography by Oliver Wood (\\"Die Hard 2\\", \\"Face/Off\\", the three \\"Bourne\\" movies), with a haunting and spare score by Ramin Djawadi.
B005D9MUWY|1.0|Was good until update, question mark gone from keys, have to long press then select, and doesn't guess words properly like it used to, please tell me how to uninstall update, please, or I'll have to uninstall.
B000AM6OQ2|4.0|Watching recently (albeit, verrry reluctantly) that unceasingly-awful 2005 remake of \\"The Fog\\" did little more than remind me yet again what a genuinely scary, haunting and memorable movie the 1980 John Carpenter-directed original is -- one that I think, in many ways, is vastly superior not only to Carpenter's first bonified horror film (1978's \\"Halloween\\"), but also superior to many of the ones that Carpenter made AFTER \\"The Fog\\" (\\"The Thing\\", \\"Prince Of Darkness\\" and \\"Vampires\\" among them.<br /><br />And A LOT of the credit for the lasting resonance 1980's \\"The Fog\\" still has really should go to the film's star, Adrienne Barbeau (John Carpenter's then-wife, by the way). From the first moment we see Barbeau in the movie (she plays a divorced, single mother who owns a small radio station that overlooks the town where this mysterious, death-filled fog is fast approaching), she generates a tremendous amount of sympathy and empathy, both -- much the way that Jamie Lee Curtis did in the first \\"Halloween\\" (Curtis' co-starring role as a 20-something, hitchhiking drifter in \\"The Fog\\" seems almost like an afterthought, compared with Barbeau's here) -- which really works tremendously well toward the film's conclusion, when the fate of both Barbeau and her young son (Ty Mitchell) seems very much an open question.<br /><br />Having veteran pros like Hal Holbrook (as a duplicitous Catholic priest who may be getting his long-overdue comeuppance), Janet Leigh (as one of the town's socialites and town anniversary organizers) and John Houseman (as an old sea captain whose story at the very beginning of the film lays the ground work nicely for what follows) adds to the film's overall impressiveness -- as does the gorgeous cinematography by Dean Cundey (\\"Romancing the Stone\\", \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\\", \\"Hook\\", \\"Jurassic Park\\", \\"Apollo 13\\", etc), and the at times too-effective-for-its-own-good makeup work by Rob Bottin (\\"King Kong\\", \\"The Howling\\", \\"Total Recall\\", \\"Legend\\", \\"Se7en\\", \\"Mimic\\", \\"Fight Club\\").<br /><br />Filmed primarily at Point Reyes National Seashore -- which has seldom, if ever, looked more beautiful (or menacing!! (LOL)
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|Don't believe me and watch it. If wagging a dead dog's head in the dark and howling from the dark woods gets you off, then dig this one. The constant camera shaking is a cheap trick to hide the lack of investment into good special effects. Not so special in any way. Absolute trash.
B002ZG97LK|5.0|No film I've seen so far in 2012 -- neither in a movie theater, nor on DVD -- has proven to be a BIGGER and BETTER surprise for me that 2011's \\"Footloose\\" ... a terrific (and terrifically-entertaining) remake of one of my LEAST favorite movies of the 1980s (one of many that came out back then where the film's soundtrack evidently had been written longgggg before anyone gave ANY thought whatsoever to constructing an even remotely-plausible movie plot that very same much-ballyhooed soundtrack might sorta-kinda \\"fit into\\", and/or a plot that otherwise resonated with even a modicum of genuine emotion).<br /><br />What co-writer/director Craig Brewer (\\"Hustle & Flow\\", \\"Black Snake Moan\\") has done here is basically re-invent/re-think the original \\"Footloose\\" from the ground, up -- providing, among many other things, a very understandable, plausible and empathetic reason now why the father-preacher character in \\"Footloose\\" (John Lithgow in the original; a much-better Dennis Quaid in the remake) does what he does.<br /><br />In the original, Lithgow's character came across as a verrry thinly-veiled, self-serving loon ... someone who was simply \\"deranged\\" because he A) Believes in God, and B) Has banned dancing, live music, etc, throughout the small town where the \\"Footloose\\" characters live.<br /><br />Conversely, in this 2011 version, we know almost immediately what has happened to both this town in general, and to Quaid's character in particular -- boy, do we EVER!! -- so pretty much EVERYTHING that follows that admittedly-horrific event does, for the most part, make sense (psychologically, emotionally, politically, etc).<br /><br />Add to that the fact that the main couple in the movie (Lori Singer and Kevin Bacon in the original; Julianne Hough and Kenny Wormald in the remake) are now a MUCH more compelling, interesting, well-developed and well-rounded couple than they ever were in the mostly-forgettable 1980s version.<br /><br />Hough and Wormald are also, arguably, CONSIDERABLY BETTER dancers, too (than either Bacon or Singer were), having won much-deserved accolades on numerous appearances of \\"Dancing With the Stars\\" over a five-year period -- among other very impressive professional-dancing credentials.<br /><br />Plus, the music arrangements the filmmakers have done here with the songs from the original's soundtrack are nothing short of astonishing -- with special kudos to 15-year-old, North Carolina native ELLA MAE BOWEN (whose hauntingly-beautiful and wonderfully-quiet rendition of \\"We Need a Hero Now\\" is a real improvement in many ways, I think, over the obnoxiously-loud/pulsing Bonnie Tyler version that was featured in the first \\"Footloose\\").<br /><br />(Bowen has a number of superb musical performances on YouTube that you may want to look up asap).<br /><br />Faith-based and character-driven movies -- and 2011's \\"Footloose\\" is NOTHING if not THAT -- may not have had any place in mainstream Hollywood productions back in the 1980s, but thankfully they seem to have one now. And this constantly-surprising remake is proof-positive that you actually CAN have a father character in a film who genuinely DOES care about his daughter and who isn't merely an unceasingly-cartoonish/bufoonish, Bible-thumping caricature of one.<br /><br />\\"Footloose\\" (2011) is  movie with a lot of heart, soul, and wisdom in it. Didn't surprise AT ALL when I learned the other day (from the DVD's director's commentary) that co-writer/director Craig Brewer has two children of his own.<br /><br />It REALLY shows in this \\"Footloose\\" remake, Mr. Brewer...  :)

B007MG360G|1.0|has anyone else noticed that in Doodle God, Doodle devil, and Doodle farm that there is an eye in a triangle?!?! illuminati worthy.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|i thought this would be a pretty cool app, but you have to unlock most of the games. ok, thats understandable. no problem.<br />the problem is that it takes way too long to cellect enough points to unlock new games. you have to keep playing the old games over and over and over (and over and over...) just to unlock a single new game.<br />well of course that makes the games get boring pretty fast.<br />so i got incredibly bored with this app and, since getting bored is the opposite of what games should do,  i uninstalled.
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|One word to sum it all up. Amazing. The Dark Knight has been my favorite movie since I had seen it in the theater(as part of a Dark Knight/ X-Files: I Want to Believe double feature.) and remains thus. Everything about The Dark Knight stands out, not only amongst other comic book movies, but movies in general. The tone was one of insanity and chaos perfectly match by the on-screen antics of none other than The Joker, Batman's greatest foe. Thus we segue into the major article of discussion for this movie, the brilliant Heath Ledger. Taken from us too soon, Heath Ledger not only made this character his own, but he also took the time to learn and understand it. He knew The Joker inside and out, playing the role perfectly in every way.<br /><br />With no regard for his own life or anyone else's, the Joker embarks on a quest of sorts to tear Gotham apart by attempting to turn its greatest citizens into twisted versions of the heroes they once were, while Batman tries to stay true to his values with the help of the always supportive Alfred Pennyworth, expertly performed by Michael Kaine, Gotham's brave new DA; Harvey Dent and the unfortunate, Rachael Dawes.<br /><br />Not only the greatest Batman movie ever made, but an amazing movie in its own right.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|If you enjoy reading badly written trash then this book is for you.  It reminded me of comic books without the fun drawings.<br /><br />No I did not finish reading the book.  I choked on the first chapter or two then realised life is too precious to waste further!
B007UXSPK2|1.0|The action was great but the story was way too many holes in it.  Summing it up.  It was a mix bag of action with little thought of the story.
B0081KTI0E|4.0|If you want to fill a hiatus in your course of living through the day, this is an entertaining movie, like an old time ghost story I give it a 4 star rate for that purpose.

B007D2XSW0|1.0|I was excited for this app, esp good for being a free app release. But it doesn't work. It won't let me add any pictures to edit. Please fix!
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|My husband ordered this album because it was recommended by Amazon based on his order for Trampled by Turtles cds and he listened to the samples and loved them.  If we ordered one more cd the shipping was free so they were worth a try.  Well we are huge fans now.  They are an amazing band.  You should have this cd!  Our whole family is enjoying the music.  We listen to it in the car and in the house and in the garage and at family gatherings.
0345803485|1.0|How on earth 3,000 readers could give this book a one star is incredible!!!! What else do they read?

B0086700CM|4.0|It constantly turns off any app that is playing audio in the background. I like to listen to podcasts on google listen while playing games, but this app keeps shutting it off once I start the game
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The games are somewhat challenging. The games can be somewhat fun and addictive. The add driven base at times is not really appropriarpte toy my likes.  I do think overall the 101 games is o.k. I am over 13 by several decades. The games are great timewasters. Some games are mostly definitely too challenging and some games are not game or User friendly.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|its nice doesn't seem to have many add ons.to purchase like other farmville style games. yet. but the constant nagging for quests is kinda annoying.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|I wish I could have tried it but in never finished installing on my kindle fire. A waste of your time it sounds like with the other reviews also.
1450400957|5.0|I've been strength training forever and never thought I needed a book on it but this changed my mind.  This has the best illustrations of the muscle groups being worked of any book there is.  Why would you need this? Motivation.<br /><br />I often think of my muscles under my skin working as I lift weights, but never have a clear idea of exactly what they look like.  Now I do.  Why do I need to visualize each muscle group? Something about doing that keeps me on target and in the proper form as I lift.<br />Even though I'm not a beginner, I now know exactly where those muscles are and what they look like.<br /><br />I also like having a neat concise directory of every lifting movement there is practically and can go through this book about once a week and refine my workout routine making sure I don't skip any muscle.  The illustrations are so great that it's inspiring.  Looking at this makes me want to work out.<br /><br />It also helps when I am explaining to others what lifts to do and how to do them as I occasionally do.  People can see immediately the correct form and the target muscles.<br /><br />I wasn't sure I would keep this book when I ordered it but was curious.  It is much better<br />than any book I have seen on this subject and is a definite keeper.
B0086700CM|5.0|I absolutely love this game! It's quite addicting! But, I swear when you're nearing the end and almost have that last piece, it purposefully doesn't acknowledge your swipe... I don't know!! Still love it! If you're looking to get addicted, I recommend.
B006LSZECO|4.0|excellent read, exciting plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat. however, when you get to the ending you are left hanging! very poor conclusion. perhaps the author wants to leave you hanging so she can write a sequel.
0545091020|5.0|This is an excellent book that kept me riveted for the different twist and turns.  It catches your attention and makes you want more.  I would definitely recommend it to others
0765316994|5.0|Andrew Dahl is an ensign in the Universal Union in the 25th century. He has just been assigned as a crew member aboard the Intrepid, a famous flagship of the UU. Obviously thrilled and excited to join the xenobiology laboratory, he is eager to join the ranks and put his knowledge to good use. It starts out well enough with him meeting some other newcomers and becoming friends until things get weird. Away missions are very common on this vessel, but so are deadly encounters with extraterrestrials, the deaths of low ranking officers, and the bizarre survival of the ship's captain, Lieutenant Kerensky, and the chief science officer despite any sort of injury or disease. The older crew members know this and tend to avoid the missions or throw the new crew members into it to save themselves. Why are the mortality rates for this ship so high? Will Andrew even live to figure out why?<br /><br />John Scalzi is one my favorite science fiction writers ever. His Old Man's War series is made of awesome and if you haven't read it, you need to right now. I was dying to know what he would do with the poor, hapless and nameless characters that died practically each episode in Star Trek. I expected fun and silliness (of which there is plenty), but I was pleasantly surprised that Redshirts had so much more depth to it. It's kind of like a mixture Star Trek and Cabin in the Woods. This book is very meta and self aware. It plays with and pokes fun of the conventions of science fiction while managing to be innovative and new at the same time. I don't want to post spoilers, but the plot twist is awesome and very unexpected. It opens up a philosophical discussion of existence and the purpose of life alongside the perpetuation, condemnation, and examination of sci-fi tropes.<br /><br />The characters made the book amazing for me. Unlike their Star Trek counterparts, they are fully fleshed out characters with diverse backgrounds, extensive training, interesting personalities, and hilariouscomedic timing. I liked seeing their world through their perspective. Usually shows are focused on higher ranked characters, but, through Dahl and his friends' eyes, we view the ship from a much different point of view. The codas at the ends are my favorite part because they detail what the ramifications of the resolution of the story are and they pack an emotional punch. One of them even brought me to tears, which was totally unexpected from what I thought was a light summer read.<br /><br />Redshirts is a half parody half homage to Star Trek that works on a variety of levels. It's one of my favorite reads this year. I highly recommend this funny, emotional, and thought provoking book to any fan of sci-fi.
0545101417|4.0|I can understand the cliff hanger ending that leads to the final book in the series.  But for this book, I felt I missed something in the end.  The arena action wasn't drawn out into details as the first book.  This too had me wanting more  of the story.
0738212415|5.0|I have a lot of art experience under my belt but have always felt a little shaky when it comes to drawing. I have had drawing classes both self-taught and college level and this is the first time I am really getting it. Yes, the illustrations are cartoonish but that is the brilliance of it. These lessons are deceptively simple. A child can do them and produce fun drawings and hopefully cultivate a love of drawing. An adult can do the same lessons and gain some really solid principles that can be applied at a higher level. I have had many 'duh' moments while going through this book. Understand that I am a very analytical person and respond to that level of instruction, but this is a book that finally points out the obvious things that our eyes see but which are so difficult to translate into our drawings. No, it is probably not a book for everyone who wants to learn to draw but for a person like me, who tends to over-think everything, it has been really helpful.
B00881VLCE|4.0|this a really good app they just need some more colorful pictures and more number of pieces to do. ok
B005K17RU0|5.0|intuitive and informative. very easy to use. the hour to hour is on point. the widget is good looking and helpful.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I got the 2.0 version and it works great on my kindle fire. Fantastic app, so simple to use and elegantly designed. Everything works properly, I can work on pictures from my gallery and it saves to gallery when finished. I highly recommend it
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Definitely reminds me of Mario. I like this game a lot. brings back Mario memories. Great for children. my niece loves it!
B005LAII08|4.0|Animation is what one would expect from pixar. The laugh never stops. Story is fast paced and relevent. Highly recommended for the whole family. I will get the bluray when it becomes available, but only the 2D version.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is seriously awesome! I loved it a lot. I was surprised when I found out that I hadn't beaten everyone else to the book by starting it at 6:30 in the morning. Oh,well. Someone must have stayed up all night waiting for it. I don't blame them;-)<br />I was also surprised to find that there is a 4th book! When I found out, boy was I mad! I wanted to boast that I had finished the series. Oh,well. Something else to look forward to.<br />Whoever is reading this, let me just say that you won't be disappionted. Percy Jackson is waiting.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is great time consumer for when I'm bored Kr waiting around. it has a lot of challenges and their very entertaining
B007D2XSW0|4.0|I like this app because there are a lot of choices to edit your picture. If you are a picture enthusiast like myself this is a great app to have on your phone. The only downfall is about half the time I have a hard loading a picture from my gallery.
1579125549|4.0|A really good book to sharpen one's game tactics. It has a very extensive set of short problems with answers in the back. I only wish that the format was a tad different. For instance, have one page with the problems and the answers on the back of the same page.
B005K17RU0|5.0|was trying to plan my day but wasn't sure about the weather so I pulled up this app and it gave me the outlook for the day thru. the satellite picture. totally. awesome!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Bad book!  Read meymoon's review,\\" was this written by a teenager?\\".  She was spot on. Don't bother with it. Waste of money. I should have known better.
B007Y360A0|5.0|This Big Bang episode shows even when the writers are exploring new ground with the caracters that its still comic genius. The best part of the show is Sheldon drunk, but that is just to peak your interest.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|This app would not even load for me. Uninstalled within first five minutes. Glad it was free so I'm not out five bucks!
B004WCTLNY|2.0|Matt Damon showed great acting as usually but I just dont get it. Very strange film.  I must have missed something.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game.  The Ice Age movies are fun to watch and to have a game based on the characters is great.  Gameloft has lots of neat games.  Keep up the good work, Gameloft.
B006P0FD4W|4.0|This movie was just as scary as the first part. It has the same suspenseful-edge-of-your-seat quality. AND just to kill the monotony, a few extra things were thrown in to keep it interesting. I really enjoyed it. I have all 3 parts in my dvd collection. Will there be a 4th part? Who knows. If so, I think it will be worth looking at.
B005LAIH5O|5.0|I liked the first one but loved the second one. Action was great and so was the special effects. This is a must see for all action junkies such as myself
B003Q6D25K|4.0|After seeing the first part, I was anxious to see the sequel and I must say, I was not disappointed. It moved on from where it left off. A new house and family to terrify, with a surprise ending. You might ask yourself, how is this movie going to be different from the first part? Well, there's only one way to find out. WATCH IT!!
0307346617|5.0|Anyone that knows me will tell you that my greatest fear is the walking dead. I did not always had this fear; in fact I gave zombies no thought at all. Then my boyfriend decided to convince me to watch \\"Dawn of the Dead\\". I told him I did not like gory movies, and he told me it was not gory at all. He lied! I discoverd that my greatest fear was being eaten by a dead human. I slept with a light on for two weeks! I am the type of person who likes to face their fears head on. Since I cannot actually see a \\"real\\" zombie to face my fear, I decided to read a horror book on Zombies. World War Z was that book. I recommend reading this book even if it is not your genre. I read mostly modern romantical books. I usually do not enjoy a book unless it has a love relationship in the story line. Brooks surprised me in the fact that he did include a love story. A story of humanity and the love of humans to love one another, and to come together in the worse of times. Also the love of country, in which, I have found truly lack in our modern day society. The book is written in a somewhat confusing way of interviews with people who survived the walking dead. I recommend reading it at least 3 times. Not back to back of course, but I found about the third time that the story actually followed through to the end with the people of the interviews. I did not notice this the first time I read it. The zombie part was scary, and Brooks spares no part of the gory details. Mostly for me the book did not scare me like I thought it would, and I enjoyed it. The part that stood out the most is the human will to survive. Parts of this book even made me cry, and I have never cry reading a book before. This book struck me in the most unexpected way. The human factor in this book makes it worth reading. God helps us if \\"World War Z\\" ever really happens. ( I have spoke to a virologist and he insures me that the \\"walking dead\\" is physically impossible, but doctors have been wrong before. I still have a fear of zombies! I thank God I would not survive long after if the dead start walking. I am positive I will die of a massive heart attack.)
B00881VLCE|4.0|Great puzzles. Enjoyed putting them together along with my family. Both my kids are able to put the puzzles together. Family fun for all.
B007V5CF5K|4.0|I am enjoying this game....well-worth the $!<br />If you like games where you are challenged to find missing parts, and surprises, this one doesn't disappoint.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Building your book for Kindle is the definitive guide for writers that are attempting to publish their books in the kindle format. My first attempt at writing my book in this format did not go as expected because it wasn't obvious to me that there are rules to follow that will make this process a lot easier with much better results. This guide has helped me to take my writing to a whole new level!
B007WOA1IS|4.0|The book has lots of good info on London. However be warned, the maps and images are not easy to read or use when viewed on Kindle.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Catching Fire by Suzanne Collins holds the attention of the reader--any age.  Altough a work of fiction, it holds lots of good advice for those who choose to govern this nation.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I got this as the free app of the day just to try it out.  Me and my friend fell in love with the great quality.  Even if you just do auto-fix it is still amazing.  All the bad reviews are wrong, unless they are about the price.  It was expensive, so I'm glad I got it for free.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|You know it's a masterpiece when the first three songs blow you away and end up being the weakest tracks on the album. I'd say Caravan, BU2B, and Clockwork Angels continue the sound the band has been exploring the last two decades. These songs could easily fit on albums like Counterparts, Test For Echo, or Vapor Trails; all great albums I might add. The Anarchist completely stopped me in my tracks. This track hearkens back to the sounds of Signals, but with a little harder edge; an instant classic. Following is the track Carnies. The intro is quite unorthodox for Rush; Alex' guitar playing reminds me of John Petrucci. The track quickly morphs into something more \\"Rush-like\\". It could easily fit on Roll The Bones or Counterparts and is another highlight of the album. Alex' brief solo on this track reminds me of his solo on Leave That Thing Alone. Following Carnies is Halo Effect; a nice break from the awesome wall of sound that precedes it. This track is the album's \\"Resist\\". I love when the boys break out the acoustic guitars. This may be the most underrated song on the album; very emotional and beautifully executed. The following three tracks may be the strongest on the album: Seven Cities of Gold; The Wreckers; and, Headlong Flight. The comparison to older albums is growing old so I will just say that these three tracks are vintage Rush. Not vintage in the sense that they sound exactly like previous works; more in the sense that they showcase a band at the height of its artistry and technical proficiency. Geddy's bass playing really shines on these three tracks. Alex' solo on Headlong Flight sounds like his early eighties guitar work. The album finishes on two very strong tracks; Wish Them Well and The Garden. Snakes And Arrows is not one of my favorite Rush albums, but there are still a few tracks I really love from that album. Wish Them Well sounds to me like the best parts of S&A. A lot of people are singing the praises of the album closer The Garden. This track doesn't have such a strong impact on me, but I still think it's solid. \\"Solid\\" is the word I would use to describe Clockwork Angels. It may not have big hits like The Spirit of Radio or Tom Sawyer, but what it does have is consistently great songs throughout the entire album; there is not one weak track. CA is also the first concept album Rush has produced since the 70's. Actually, it may technically be the only concept album Rush has ever produced as those 70's albums always included a handful of tracks that were unrelated to the overarching theme. Speaking of the lyrics, I realize I haven't said a word about Mr. Peart's contribution to CA. Let's face it, Neil is such an outstanding drummer and lyricist that it's often easy to take him for granted. There's no question that Neil is a huge part of what makes Rush...well, Rush! I suppose I've just missed Alex, who I feel has made a big comeback on this album. This is ironic because Alex' disdain for keys made the last few albums more guitar driven, but somehow his distinct sound got lost in all the layering. I feel like his presence is much stronger on CA; sometimes less can be more. :) I would say that Clockwork Angels is right up there with the best albums Rush has ever produced. This is pretty impressive when you consider that this band's first album came out almost 40 years ago. Clockwork Angels combines the greatest elements of the band's last three decades. I personally love each era of this extraordinary band's history so Clockwork Angels is a real treat.

B0079IEPHA|5.0|NO SPOILERS<br /><br />The answer is 52 and it represents the number of TV appearances by Gina Torres (Senior Partner Jessica Pearson), which includes stints on Alias, Firefly and Angel!  Then there is Rick Hoffman (Junior Partner Louis Litt) who is \\"annoyingly good\\" be it as a Wall Street Sales Guy sending an intern to Brooklyn to get a bagel or a fast talking ADA.<br /><br />These veterans anchor the 2-main characters:<br /><br />Gabriel Macht (New Senior Partner and Rising Star Harvey Specter)<br /><br />Patrick Adams (Pseudo Lawyer Mike Ross)<br /><br />Honorable Mention:<br /><br />Meagan Markle (The \\"Tasty\\" Paralegal Rachel)<br /><br />Sarah Rafferty (Mike's Longtime Assistant Donna)<br /><br />The show is equal part Mike learning how to be a Lawyer under Harvey's tutelage, equal part scrambling to keep Mike's secret and equal part character interaction: Mike with Rachel, Harvey with Jessica and Louis with everyone.  Then there is Donna that protects Harvey with the ferocity of either a sibling or one who might hold repressed feelings.<br /><br />This is a show that I feel would have a chance in The Fall Prime Time Schedule.

0525478817|5.0|This book is amazing. I can only say that it changed my life - I have never cried from reading until I read this.
B0077PBPJ6|5.0|I'll not bore readers with another synopsis of \\"Birdsong\\"'s story and just say the sex scenes are some of the more realistic sex scenes I've seen produced on film (wish MPT would have broadcast them uncut.)  The sex act is not overly romanticized in these sex scenes.  Actually, they're quite raw and compelling.  The honest treatment of sex and masculine emotion are probably why some viewers can't handle this film, its too real for them.  I'm a lifetime viewer/fan of MPT and I thought the producers made a daring, fresh choice presenting this film.  It made an emotionally complex statement and took viewers out of their comfort zones.  It was well deserving of presentation on MPT.  Eddie Redmayne!  I'm looking forward to seeing more of his work, he's got star written all over him, if he keeps it as honest as he did in this film, he's definitely going to go places...
1559408855|5.0|I saw this film again a couple of weeks ago for the 2nd time. Saw it the 1st time 5 years ago and that time it was much much more than I could digest. I thought seeing it a second time would have less of an effect on me and it did but only enough for me to see through its perverse and often inhuman surface into the metaphor of the whole thing--this is both the beauty of and problems with things classified as art.<br /><br />The beauty of this film is that, taken symbolically, it makes a bold statement about the moral desensitization and decay of the society we now live in. A society that is becoming more and more desensualized and that seeks out stranger and more and more unnatural modes of stimulation. This is what I got on the 2nd viewing after being exposed to it before and in a sense desensitized enough to view it creatively instead of literally.<br /><br />The problem with this film is that the director pulled no punches in employing many social taboos in expressing his idea, particularly rape, bestiality,sexual abuse and depravity--all involving children and men and women old enough to be their grandparents. If you're still reading this, you might like this film. A problem to some, though, may not be a problem for others. I'll admit that seeing Salo a second time made me appreciate other aspects of it like the sets, the cinematography, the overall presentation, the settings, especially the villa where the bulk of the story takes place. But I believe that the images and situations in the film are so powerful that the primal responses they arouse makes it a film only a few will be open-minded enough to appreciate. I believe this film is prophetic but that's my perspective and art invites many perspectives depending on those looking at it, their values, their world view, and their view of themselves. I didn't do a synopsis because that's been done in previous posts. Just giving my slant on the film for anybody who may be wondering whether there's more to it than a bunch of old fascists abusing kids. View at your own risk!a bunch of old fascists abusing kids.

B0055PMJMW|5.0|I love all the Harry Bosch novels! Connelly is a great writer and his plots are guaranteed to keep you on your toes!
B0052VUNHC|4.0|one of those books you fly through. it is a college romance with good charachter development and some depth. a worthwhile vacation or weekend escape book.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|My first Amazon app review after downloading and trying 90% of the ones offered. My reason for reviewing this one? The developer really impressed me.  They fixed the listed issues that were on here. I can save photos wo issue at all.  There is even a tutorial and explanation as to how/why things were fixed.  Very nicely done.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|this app is really great. it was really good that I got it free too. you can even create memes!  definitely worth trying out
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like that the games are entertaining but some of them just seem too impossible to beat! But I would definitely recommend it to an avid gamer!

B007D2XSW0|4.0|My wife and I were shocked at how fun and easy this app is to use.  There are a great variety of ways to manipulate your photos.  Usability improvements need to be added for some things like zooming and resizing stickers and I would give it 5 stars.  Great Job to the developers.  Verified working on Motorola Atrix 4g and HTC Inspire.
B006LQQ1GE|2.0|I listened to the snippets prior to ordering this CD, and from what I heard, thought this would be a great addition to my collection. Unfortunately, there are only a couple of songs that I like.
B007JWKLP6|5.0|This is a fabulous Blu-ray. But just as in real life, George gets pushed aside on the DVD. The first half had me wondering why is it entitled \\"George Harrison\\" when all you're being shown are The Beatles. But in the second half it's all George and what you will learn (even for Huge Beatle fans) is what a giving and caring person he was. Rich, famous and who cares could have been his motto. And if you've never seen George's son...you'll think you're looking at a 25 year old \\"inconsequential\\" Beatle.
B005LAIGW8|3.0|The old bike was better looking, I liked that bike better than the one in goast 2.<br /><br /> Cage acted like a drug junkie, with a lot of neck movements that looked more like a nerve problem.<br /><br /> I like Cage as an actor, but this one left me wondering...<br /><br /> Dont know how close it was to the comic book, never read it, and don't really care to<br /><br /> Liked the first movie, and the second is to me just so so to me<br /><br /> If they do make a third movie I hope they bring back the first bike, it was hot.<br />and I will probly buy it too ( the movie, not the bike. )
B005K17RU0|5.0|fast and easy. I love that I can check the forecast each day in a few seconds and it is just as accurate as watching the local weathermans Tv forecast. never had any problems with this app.
0790729601|5.0|Another good DVD to watch. some people can write a book on nothing, I can't and won't. All I can say is I liked it, I think you will to.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|good game interesting good mechanics good progression good gold system even though they want you to buy Shit from them 3.5/5 Imo good enough for a free game. good waste of time on a trip or skmethjng

B008ASLK8A|1.0|I like to watch the movies the way I want them. I don't have any problem with Netflix (streaming or otherwise). But the Amazon movies are awful. Never again. Amazon does not tell you what is in their version - there are no subtitles available, which is a staple of all movies.<br />I will never buy a movie from Amazon again.
