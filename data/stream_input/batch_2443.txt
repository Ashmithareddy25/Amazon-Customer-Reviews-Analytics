B009NY43NY|1.0|After all these years and all this time reading what was a great series in the beginning, it ends like that??? I just finished the book and I AM DEPRESSED! Please, Ms. Harris, write one more Sookie Stackhouse novel and fix this mistake! I recommend reading this book to those faithful Sookie followers like myself just so you know how it ends. But beware, you might be disappointed too.

193700788X|1.0|*Some SPOILERS*<br />What just happened here?  Did I read this?  Yes, yes, I did read the very disappointing and puerile ending to the Sookie Stackhouse series.  I'll be honest, it's been going downhill for many books now.  I had such fun reading the first Sookie books that I kept hoping that magic would happen again.  Nope.  Others have pointed out major spoilers in their reviews, so I won't repeat here but, really, it's like Harris has just lost all interest in these characters.  She has done this with other series (Lily Bard, et al.) just dropping them and I almost wish she'd done that here.  I guess with the TV show and all she had to put some kind of ending together.  And what a boring, stupid ending it is.  Sookie has gone...nowhere.  And ended up...nowhere.  Other beloved characters are trashed, most just fade away into nothing, and some bizarre fae plot twist is supposed to tie the book together?  It. Makes. No. Sense.  Just, very disappointing.

B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Fearless a true story about a young man named Adam Brown that showed true courage and sacrifice throughout his life. A Christian, family man and a warrior in the true sense of the word.<br />Adam's life was a series of ups and downs ,but mainly downs until Jesus came into his heart and changed his life. Adam full of life, adventurous and \\"fearless\\" he would go at things full steam and his compassion for his fellow man was well demonstrated when his hummer rolled in Afghanistan. Even though his hand was badly mangled he did not stop to worry about himself but the welfare of his team and others always came first for him. Adams story was made possible from  his personal journal and first person accounts of the Seals themselves.<br /> I thoroughly enjoyed this story and highly recommend it to others to read.<br /><br />I Received this book free for an honest review.

B00B97SNJI|3.0|I've been fortunate enough to catch these guys live twice in the last 6 months or so. This is a good album, but it is nowhere close to &#34;Nothing is Wrong&#34;, which is a phenomenal album that I've probably listened to over a 100 times. There are a couple of decent tracks, and &#34;From a Window Seat&#34; (the first single from the album) has finally grown on me somewhat. It's going to be hard to make a better album than &#34;Nothing is Wrong&#34;, so I guess I will just need to adjust my expectations.
B000002KIK|5.0|Could be Ozzy's strongest vocals on a Black Sabbath album. Bill Ward pounds the hell out of the drums. Geezer has a great bass tone and plays rockin bass riffs. Tony Iommi is a creative genius on guitar.<br />I hope \\"13\\" is as good as Never Say Die!!!<br /><br />Highlights for me are...<br />Tony Iommi's epic guitar solo in Johnny Blade.<br />The dramatic ending of Junior's Eyes<br />Ozzy's vocals and Tony's guitar solo in Hard Road.<br />Shock Wave - the whole song is spacy and tripy. Tony's guitar solo is nasty and wicked and the ending has hints of classic sounding dark Sabbath.<br />The jazz of Air Dance and Tony's ripping guitar solo.<br /><br />Never Say Die is definitey different and definitey one of my favorites.
193700788X|1.0|I would prefer to leave this a 1/2 star, but that's not available. I feel like the bulk of this books in this series were a gimmick. Initially, there was a strong plot and character development, but in this book, the character development implodes. Sookie acts out of character again and again, and the \\"facts\\" of Sookieverse conveniently are amended to fit the contrived ending, ie., Sookie can no longer hear Shifters - suddenly she only gets emotions. I wished for a more thoughtful progression and a storyline that continued the idea of Sookie maturing and evolving. Instead, she's practically where we left her at the beginning, except infinitely jaded.
B00BG23LYS|3.0|I love Blood Lust.  Perfect combination of androgynous vocals, fuzzy guitar, doomy rhythms and bouncy songwriting.  This album just sounds monotonous.  It sounds to me like they took all the leftovers culled from Blood Lust and put them together and called it a new album.<br /><br />Look, I'm sorry, I really like this band and I wanted to love this album, there is just nothing that makes it special.  It almost sounds like someone else took over the songwriting duties.

030758836X|2.0|I'm extremely surprised that this book is a best seller. Mostly because it's awful. For a book that had so much potential in the beginning, it was one of the most disappointing books I have ever read. People have wrote that it has a terrible ending. What they mean is that the last 75% of the books makes no sense and is absolutely ridiculous. My point? Don't waste your time.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|My Review of HOPELESS by Colleen Hoover.<br /><br />  As a fan of Colleen Hoover's SLAMMED series, I was eagerly waiting for my next Hoover experience. I call it the Hoover experience because reading one of Colleen's books is just that--an amazing journey taken through the written word. The Hoover experience is one of total intimacy; it can bring things up that are deeply buried inside of your own soul.<br /><br />  After reading \\"Hopeless\\" I felt like my whole world had been taken from me; I was so intensely devoted to the characters--I feel like some of them became a part of me. When I was finished with the book−after my brain came back to reality−all I wanted was to go back into that world; I needed my next Hoover experience-and fast.<br /><br />  Hopeless touches on some very true to life and hard-hitting issues; so if you don't want to read something so realistic and heartbreakingly beautiful, that's your choice (but it's a choice you should highly reconsider).<br /><br />  The main character's name is Sky; Sky makes out with random guys so she can make herself feel numb. The reason that sexual intimacy with random guys pushes her so far away mentally is a big question and topic in the book.<br />Sky was adopted by a single mother who has been home schooling her for as long as she could remember. Sky begged her mother to spend her senior year at a public school; to get the life experience she feels like she is missing out on. Her mother reluctantly agrees, making Sky so happy, until she finds out that her best friend Six won't be there by her side as planned. Six decided to go abroad for school, making Sky question if she wants to go through with public school or not--she sticks to her plan and hopes for survival.<br /><br /> Sky's best friend is one of the best parts of this book; Six is so funny and unique, everyone is going to wish they had someone like her in their life. Six will tell you how it is- and in the most randomly entertaining way possible. I have to mention one of my favorite quotes from Six in my review.<br /><br />\\"Sky, I've been worried about you for four years, thinking this would never happen. I would be fine if you were gay. I would be fine if you only liked skinny, short, geeky guys. I would even be fine if you were only attracted to really old, wrinkly men with even wrinklier penises. What I haven't been fine with is the thought of you never being able to experience lust.\\"-Six<br /><br />  Sky finally feels something after making out with Holder-the male main character of Hopeless. Sky and Holder carry the drama and deep emotional aspect of the book. It does get intense, which is why I think Hoover had Six in the book as well as Sky's gay, Mormon best friend Breckin.<br /><br />  Sky can be herself around Breckin and instantly connects with him. Breckin brings out the light and happiness in Sky that she may have been missing since Six's journey abroad. Sky has one of my favorite quotes as well; she is introducing the two men in her life for the first time.<br /><br />\\"Breckin this is Holder. Holder is not my boyfriend, but if I catch him trying to break the record of best first kiss with another girl, then he'll soon by my not breathing non-boyfriend.\\"<br /><br />  Now onto the main theme that I got out of the book; I feel like if I get into more detail, my review would be giving away spoilers, and no one wants one of Hoover's twists to be spoiled before they finish their experience. This book really made me think: What if everything I knew about my life was in reality mostly false? What if I pushed memories so far back in my head I can't remember them? Can love overcome my hardships and get me through times of weakness?<br /><br />  Sky is tested with all of those questions, which makes for some very touching and gut wrenching reading. You won't be the same after reading Hopeless; it makes you take your entire life, turn it upside-down, shake it up, and try to figure out who the hell you reallyare.<br /><br />  This was by far my best Hoover experience to date. I recommend this book to everyone; if you are too young, buy a copy and read it when the time is right. Trust me, this book has so many hidden messages you would be missing out on so much if you let this book pass you by.are.<br /><br />  This was by far my best Hoover experience to date.

B0058SNJCA|5.0|I bought this model because expresso color is a color that can be combined easily and because I have other sandals croccs a similar model called Malindi in blue and have proved to me that the most comfortable sandals ever had there. So I decided to buy this model. The've tried and although they are a little tighter than the model Malindi, are equally comfortable. They are perfect for the beach, rainy days in the city, to walk many hours ... I actually prefer these sandals to sports shoes, I feel fresher, more comfortable. Plus they have a great price which makes them very attractive are very versatile, anatomic sole is really no bother and no part of the foot. I recommend them 100%

193700788X|1.0|My favorite books in the series are 4 and 8, just to let you know what my taste is like. This book was the worst one, did i really spend I dont know, over 125 bucks on this series???<br /><br />SPOILER:<br /><br />Um, Eric is an awesome character. Sookie did screw him over in the last book; she clearly didn't love Eric. Poor Eric, to end him like that. I HATE what CH did. She didn't have to make Sookie end up with Eric, but to end him like that??/ I will not read another one of her books. Why? bc she was lazy with the last few books and then put no effort into the ending. She ended up with Sam?? That makes no sense, they have no chemistry!!!! Also, to have Bill tell Sookie about what Eric did.. grr. Bill raped her, why is she even friends with him??? It took a few books to work up Sookie and Eric, and to throw it away in a few pages. >.> Giving this series away, I don't want it on my book shelf.<br /><br />After giving this some thought, Eric is better off without her.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|One of my all time favorites. This is such a wonderful love story, with both heartbreak and happiness. I recommend this book to anyone who has a soft spot for love stories because this is a really great one. I'm sad that it had to end but so glad it ended happily!
193700788X|5.0|I feel that the series ended in the only appropriate manner. Anything else wouldn't have been true to the characters; especially given Sookie's personal growth throughout the books. It is well written (as all of Ms. Harris' books are) and I enjoyed it very much.

B003G4W49C|5.0|In honor of the movie trailer release (finally) of the Ender Game movie, here is a quick review of one of my all-time favorite books to date, Ender's Game (Ender, Book 1) by Orson Scott Card!<br /><br />In a world at war with aliens (Buggers), 6 year old genius, Ender Wiggin is possibly their best hope at survival.  Ender lives in a time where children are bred to be intelligent and then the best of the best are sent to train to become soldiers.  Ender's older siblings, Peter and Valentine look to be good candidates but instead Ender is the chosen one for Battle School.  Things weren't easy for him at home with his brothers sadistic behavior but neither is it very pleasant at school where he is one of the youngest and smallest and brightest boys resulting in great rivalries and alienation.<br /><br />As Ender advances he begins to know all too well that it is lonely at the top.  He also starts to battle within himself with the fear that he continues to become more and more like the brother he swore he was nothing like.  Will he be able to overcome his obstacles and save Earth?  Will he be what his superiors need?  What the world needs?  What he needs?<br /><br />This books is excellently written and really pulls the reader into the story.  Each and every character has a story to tell and the ending will floor you!  Let it be said, that this is a book about children but not for children.  There are definitely some graphic scenes.
B009MYARIK|4.0|Anyone who has read (and enjoyed) a Sophie Kinsella novel is familiar with her ability to write fun, lighthearted books with flawed, yet likeable characters. Wedding Night is no exception. This book is a quick and entertaining read. Wedding Night's main characters are two sisters named Lottie and Fliss. The storyline goes back and forth between the two women as one goes through a divorce while the other is waiting to get engaged. Shenanigans ensue as Lottie gets engaged to a man she barely knows and her sister, Fliss, attempts to meddle and stop her from making the biggest mistake of her life. Wedding Night is by far not my favorite Kinsella novel, there is a lot of emphasis on sexual tension which is overdone and unnecessary in my opinion. Also, the outcome for each sister and their love lives is very predictable. But overall, Wedding Night is a fun read and Kinsella fans won't be disappointed.

B00846TRHY|4.0|I had heard about this movie for about a year now. The whole idea was intriguing. A preacher and a machine gun?. It wasn't until tonight that I finally rented it. Warning: If you're expecting something sugar-coated and religious, the first half-hour will make you wonder where it's all going. It will offend your sensibilities if you haven't been on the other side of the tracks. This movie is as real as it gets in portraying how a low-life with skills in street fighting and doping, found God had something better. It doesn't show a man achieving perfection. It shows a man that saw a desperate need that few cared about and jumped in to help. A lot was said about Darfur, Sudan  by the celebrities of our day. But except for this former biker, Franklin Graham and maybe George Clooney and his dad; few have actually DONE anything.<br />Go ahead and watch this. It will give you an emotional roller-coaster ride and it will show you how one imperfect person can make a world of difference when they care enough to risk doing something.

B007MAETA8|5.0|I have fallen in love with John Mayer's music, but in a backwards kind of way.  I am a 52-year old woman and love listening to Sirius Radio's Coffeehouse~~and was loving the acoustic versions of some of his older songs as well as some of the newer ones on Born and Raised such as \\"Shadow Days\\" and \\"Love is a Verb.\\"<br /><br />Those songs prompted me to purchase Born and Raised which I absolutely adore~~I listened to most of it while traveling in my car and it absolutely takes you on a journey.  This album made me fall in love with John Mayer and prompted me to go ahead and purchase *all* of his albums so I could listen to them and appreciate them in chronological order.<br /><br />I think when he first became popular (and I lived in Atlanta the same time he did and probably passed him in the grocery store or at the post office, lol) I saw him as sort of young and cocky and I didn't care for his voice.<br /><br />But now as he's matured and turned into a grown man I am head-over-heels in love with his poetry, his guitar playing, his soul, and yes, his looks!  (ha!  can't help myself!)  There are very few artists I love enough to want *all* their music (and must have the original cd, not just downloads), but John is now in that category for me.<br /><br />For my birthday in August my beloved is taking me to see him in concert and I'm like a high school girl waiting to see my favorite pop star~~cannot wait to take it all in!

B0056TYT66|4.0|Works great so far, but installation could have been a little simpler.  I can't really blame Transcend - it's HP's fault on an annoying case design - but it would have been nice to have more attachment options.  I had to bend the metal face plate to get it to fit.

B003UV8TFE|5.0|I studied physics so I don't mind the math.  But, describing the physics of our universe in the language of a 5, 10, 20, or 50 year old who does not possess a background in math is a true accomplishment.  Comprehending some basics of physics opens the door to a truly fascinating universe.  Walter Lewin is not a physics professor; he is an artist showing the reader a new way to view nature.
193700788X|1.0|First of all, I am a neutral reviewer- I had no preference for which character Sookie ended up with, if any. So I'm not disappointed in the plot per se, just in how poorly I felt it was written, especially compared to the first few books. I really enjoyed the writing in the first few books of the series with a few exceptions. The earlier books were well written and of good quality. But as the series went on, especially the last 2-3 books, the quality declined and they didn't feel sincere, they felt more like filler material and kind of slapped together without nearly as much thought and care as the first books. It's like the author became bored and just kept throwing things in without sense.<br /><br />Now as to this final book, I won't spoil it. Many characters felt OUT of character. The plot was disappointing in that I expected more of a thrilling mystery and it just...wasn't. This didn't seem like the author cared much, and it didn't feel like it fit with her first few books so I can't believe this was well planned and thought out.<br /><br />I don't think this book is worth the high price because the quality has declined so much. Very disappointing how this series fell apart. In the beginning it was more focused but by the end there are just too many characters with not enough meaning. Sookie deserved better, in that her story could have been written in a better way. A lot of the book feels like filler just like the past few books.<br /><br />With that said, I don't like this book and am disappointed, honestly. Poor end to the series. But on a better note, it's not Sookie's choices that made me not like the book. I just feel the character deserved a better send off. And I do agree that looking back, so many books were wasted on a buildup that I can how other people feel ripped off that this ending didn't have much buildup. I guess what I'm saying is that this series went on for too long with filler and distracting additions- if the series had ended after about 5books, it could have been great, made more sense, and not felt like SO much pointless filler.<br /><br />And while I didn't have a preference as to how the romance ended up, I feel like THAT part was a good choice for Sookie. I still don't like this book, and won't re-read it. The first few books remain favorites, but none of the last 3 or 4 books of this series were too great.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|It is nice. But it doesn't have all of the alarms on the kindle. The music doesn't necessarily work. It is nice but it doesn't seem to work right
B000YIGNKE|3.0|OK rendition of the novel<br />As always book is better<br />Good acting nice setting<br />Have watched a couple of times
0385474547|2.0|I didn't like this book at all, for a number of reasons.<br /><br />The protagonist is one of the more crudely drawn and hateful POV characters I've ever run into. He prides himself on his cruelty and lack of compassion. He is a \\"great man\\" in the village, primarily because everyone is afraid of him; to my mind, that makes him more a thug than admirable. He is particularly cruel to anyone he has power over, such as his wives and children.<br /><br />While he is badly drawn, without any sympathetic aspects, none of the other characters are drawn at all. They are cardboard cut-outs. I suppose one can argue that that's how our protag sees them... but there's not even a hint around the edges that he is an unreliable narrator. In fact, I think we're supposed to identify and sympathize with him, appalling though he is!<br /><br />There's a bit of a plot stuck onto the end, and a brief bit at the beginning (our protag's father was a wastrel, so he naturally chose to become a thug)... and nothing for most of the book.  It randomly flits here and there. In its favor- and why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1- some of the traditional stories included briefly, and accounts of the cycle of the year, the food, the gods, and other cultural aspects were intriguing... but they did not make up a plot. I also wish some of them had been handled in a more cohesive way, rather than a tidbit here and another there.<br /><br />What really amazes me, looking back, is how the author accepted the \\"great men\\" and their casual and consistent brutality for much of the book... and then, when more powerful (European) forces came in and made THEM knuckle under, well, THAT was tragic. Now: I do not favor imperialism in any way. I do not think it worked to the benefit of the women and children and lower-ranking men who the \\"great men\\" were regularly abusing; they undoubtedly had it even worse when another layer of oppressor was added. But the \\"great men\\"? SO tragic when someone beats THEM up, because THEY are supposed to be the ones doing the beating! My sympathy for this perspective is lacking.<br /><br />In short, while there's some interesting content here, it's not a novel in the way such is usually described, and it requires spending way too much time with a loathsome protag that nonetheless the author seems to venerate.HEY are supposed to be the ones doing the beating!

B00ANGICRE|5.0|COMNTARY.Excelent picture and wonderfull work of the actors. Is a interesting teem, whith a sensible treatment. Is a geat picture and actuation
193700788X|1.0|I am sad to see how the author chose to end this series. Her ill treatment of the characters was appalling.  I have read all of her books and it was heartbreaking to see how she chose to end this series.<br /><br />I was hoping that she would not resort to the same plot device she wrote in the Aurora Teagarden series where the HEA character suddenly arrives from left field after not being part of the series since book one.  If she was going for understated, she missed the mark.  If she meant to end it with this particular pairing she could have been working through it the entire book so her sudden choice should not appear as someone who decided to take the lazy way out.<br /><br />How she treated the vampires is appaling.  Why create and highlight these characters and include them as a very strong presence in Sookie's life if you basically threw them away in the most horrible manner possible?<br /><br />Ms Harris, if you no longer wanted your fans to read your books, you've made your point loud and clear.  Good luck on getting anyone to purchase any of your books now or in the future.  I, for one, am so incredibly sorry that I spent my hard earned money on all of your books just so you could come back with a less than inferior ending to such a beloved character.  Shame on you!
B00ARA4SLU|3.0|I expected a best film and actuation. Anthony Hopkins work is forced and no natural. His wife, is a common actuation, acceptable and professional.

B000GBZ33C|5.0|I don't know how you can't love Cake.  They are an awesome band, and I had to repurchase a CD as mine was old and scratched.  I DO have them in Mp3 form, but CD is easier for me.  I find it weird rating bands... you either like them or you don't.  And this CD , while it's most commercial maybe, is still really really good.
B00CL0J99K|1.0|Ladies & Gents, Boys & Girls, I am not saying this lightly, this movie sucked in EVERY possible way.<br />Whether one is a Marvel enthusiast or not, there is nothing to like about this $200M cinematic disaster.<br /><br />1. Tony Stark gets his butt kicked throughout the whole movie. His armor consistently fails him. Buckets of bolts just falling apart at every turn.<br />  Isn't Iron Man supposed to be invincible?<br /><br />2. Too much Tony Stark, hardly any Iron Man. Gone is the swagger, now Tony has anxiety issues. Oh please!<br /><br />3. Iron Man is reduced to the status of malfunctioning buffoon. Too many lame attempts at humor undermine EVERYTHING. Is this supposed to be a comedy?<br /><br />4. The premise is pointless. The plot is inane and full of cliches, the dialogue is dangerously cheesy. You will neither be thrilled nor uplifted. You will neither be awed nor inspired.<br /><br />5. Of all the superhero flicks since 2000, this is simply the worst. Yes, worse than The Incredible Hulk. And if you thought Iron Man 2 was bad, this is far worse.<br /><br />6. This makes Michael Bay movies look good (he probably laughed at the jokes).<br /><br />7. Shameless product placement. Over 40 armors we barely get to see, all available at your local toy store.<br /><br />Save your time and money. For the love of Zeus, AVOID this pile of tin cans!
B001O1O71C|5.0|i was so moved by this book and not jewish. i really expect the ending.worth every word.  very sad story
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Better than most in the market and fun. Give it a try and you will say the same. Now go for it.
B00B9ZBZ2C|5.0|Stumbled across Child 44 quite by accident and was amazed to find it was a first novel.  The story is gripping and compelling and the background very well researched.  Having family ties in Russia, it was almost like talking to relatives about experiences during the Soviet regime.

0385738765|3.0|First things first: This is better than the first book, which is rare in a series. In this case, it's a dang good thing because the first book was annoying.<br /><br />There is a lot more development of the world in this book, which I think is the primary reason I liked it better. You don't find out a lot more about the plot, though. Instead the author adds more things to it. More people, more twists...things get more and more convoluted. It's not as annoying this time because you're finding out other information, at least.<br /><br />I'm starting to feel like the author is using the technological abilities of the people running things as an excuse. Plot devices are all well and good, but he's using them to change what you, the reader, already knows. Over and over. Once or twice is fine, but plot twists every couple chapters? Come on now.<br /><br />Three stars because I did like it better than the first one, and the story is interesting enough to make me read the third book. My hope of some sort of resolution is fading, and fading fast, but we'll see.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love it It is the best game ever!!I love how you can rescue animals if you cant afford to buy them. the only bad thing is I keep running out of fuel when I'm trying to rescue an animal .
B004Z4LVZK|2.0|Let's start with the obvious: This is no Hunger Games. Not even in the same league.<br /><br />I had a hard time with this book. Mainly because...nothing happens. Or rather, nothing particularly relevant happens. Lots of things occur, but the plot doesn't seem to move very quickly. There's an attempt at suspense, but in the form of withholding ANY information about what's going on, so it quickly leads to boredom. The author's characterization isn't great, but it isn't terrible either. It's not enough to carry the book, though, so the lack of significant story makes things very tedious.<br /><br />I kept reading mainly because I was frustrated. I wanted to know what was going on, and I was determined to finish the book to find out. I'm not going to say what the ending of the book was, but it left me just as frustrated. There's no closure. Two stars because I managed to finish it. I'm trying to read the next one, in the (hopefully not vain) hope that there will be some closure in that one.
B008YU0AOE|3.0|Good for taxes and doing your budget if that turns you on.<br />Handy and necessary for those household duties I suppose.
0385738781|2.0|Faster paced than either of the other books, which is a good thing. I have to feel that one of the major decisions the main character makes is just a cop-out to allow the author to continue his 'lack of information as a plot device' thing, though. It was really out of character for him, in my opinion, and that soured me quite a bit on the entire book. There are a lot of logic holes in this book, and even more questions that aren't answered. More questions are raised, more 'plot twists' occur.<br /><br />The ending, quite frankly, sucks. I won't tell you what it was, but it left me incredibly dissatisfied and didn't really resolve ANYTHING. Again, it felt like a cop-out, like the author didn't have a clue how to wrap up this convoluted mess he'd created so he just effectively erased the need to. Ever watched a movie where, at the end, the entire movie was a dream (and therefore a waste of time)? Yeah, it's about that annoying.<br /><br />Overall this entire trilogy is mediocre at best. Pass on it, there are too many good books out there to waste time on these.
B000P0J09C|3.0|Some graphic scenes about military training and some tragic outcomes.<br />Realistic portrayal of our young men in training and on the battlefield.<br />Not glorified nor vilified, just telling it like it was.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|It was a good action flick and definitely tied in the Bourne aspect, but wish there was more/some romance and the end was really abrupt..
0345455681|5.0|If you love history and novels rolled into one you will love this book.  Even the streets in London are talked about.  You will feel you are there walking down the streets with the characters.  Great way to learn history while enjoying interesting characters.
B003Y5H574|5.0|Lets be real, this movie is great. Witty, thoughtful etc.  You laugh and you laugh harder. Great cast and a great choice for movie night.
B002SAUCBC|5.0|I love how king related each character to me and I felt connected. I worried about each one and then pondered life itself. I think that was the most powerful intense grip of the story. As each layer was peeled back you realized what was important to you. After all, it wasn't the money more the desperation for the quality and then the thought that maybe just living itself was enough to make yourself happy. Money really wasn't the prize. I wonder what the reflection of after it all became.
193700788X|1.0|Well Charlaine you already have made millions off a loyal fan base, then you throw it all back in our faces for fun.<br /><br />I am a die hard romance reader so the only area of the book that interested me was the men in Sookie's life. I even overlooked Sookie many times for her stupidity but this ending really beats fudges everything up. I don't understand, did you do this fun just say *yah thats right they can't do anything about me writing a crappy ending* and *it just makes my job more interesting.*<br /><br />Why build it up? Oh that's right>> money.<br /><br />All I know is that I won't be buying anything from you ever again but that's alright you've made enough from the True Blood series anyways. Remember, reputation is all you have left at the end of the day.<br /><br />Also some are suggesting to buy this book. PLease don't. Just read at a local library and don't waste your money. Also many are saying that it wasn't that bad but I think they are just growing used to Charlaine's downward spiraling writing style thus it \\"doesn't seem that bad.\\" When I spend money I want the best.<br /><br />This message will  self destruct in 10 seconds,<br /><br />Karen
B000N2HCM4|5.0|This 'Dream From My Father'' is a warts and all account of a great man; letting us all in on his most tender memories, and reads likewise. His honesty and integrity comes through with his personal touch... letting us all in on events which made me laugh, smile, wince and sometimes cringe. HIs voice is audible through his personal account and his prose and humor mixing the story into a vocal gumbo. His mixed race persona is also related in terms of warm childhood memories, seasoned with insights into his revelations of the differences race exerted as he grew older. A good read if you like the man and a must read for those who don't know him, you'll love him!!!

193700788X|1.0|If you can read this book from the library or borrow it from a friend or any of the numerous and clandestine ways people have of reading a book these days, please do it that way. Otherwise wait for it in the local flea market...it will be there. This book stinks to the high heavens and was so predictable it was not even funny. Perhaps it was better she ended her book series if this was the best she could do.<br /><br />Harris managed to make everyone in Sookie's life a suspect or a victim, you will have to be the judge on that, just do not pay another dime for another Charlaine Harris novel. She will betray her readers and the characters she creates every time...

0756405890|2.0|It's amazing to me that soo many people liked this book soo much and even more amazing that I actually finished it.  It felt like something my ten year-old son would read, but honestly we've read better books written for kids.  I am no officiando on fantasy and sci-fi, but I absolutely LOVED The Golden Compass series, The songs of Ice and Fire series, and the Ender's Game series.  I read this book because I was looking for something in this vein...  These books had absolutely no depth! There were no big questions asked. It was like the book was two dimensional and flat.  I am still looking for a series that makes me think.  After reading the reviews of this book, I don't know if I should trust Amazon reviews.  This book was written for five year olds!  I am only giving it two stars because I finished it; so I guess it was mildly entertaining, I just kept waiting for some intelligence to appear in the book

B00BJB2C8W|5.0|If you liked &#34;Bastard&#34; and &#34;Goblin&#34; then you'll love this new album by Tyler the Creator. The beats are new and improved and the lyrics aren't as violent, but are still great and jam-packed with references. I think this album is almost perfect, the only song I didn't care for was Tamale but to each their own. Please buy the album instead of just going on Youtube and copying everything. Buying an artists' album really is a better thing to do, but again, to each their own. 5/5.

B000063COX|5.0|At certain points during his career, Steve Harris would comment during interviews that he despised punk.  Fortunately, this album shows no evidence of that. Yes, we see some of the pretensions of progressive rock here, with breakneck time-changes and noodly solos, but shoved through a meat-grinder of post-Who wall-of-sound guitar buzz and unrelenting rhythmic drive.  The riffs are amateurish and sound like practice exercises anodized onto very effective and catchy song structures, yet are somehow mesmerizing in their naivete.  The lyrics are simple, concrete, and evocative--far superior to the pseudo-intellectual fare on later efforts--enunciated by Mr. DiAnno, one of rock's great-though-underappreciated originals.  When I want Maiden, I always reach for the first album, or its follow-up, Killers (really, first album, part II).  It's just a great record, period.

1400069289|5.0|I have read only first 5 chapters and based on what I have read so far I can say this book is by far best one that I have read on the topic (and I have read fair number of books on this topic). I found all the advice in the book is based on years of solid research and not someone's hunch. The most practical idea for me was to look for a keystone habit and try to change that one and it may help you in changing many other aspects.<br /><br />Other good thing about book is that you don't have to finish entire book to find actionable advice, every chapter/section has great useful nuggets of wisdom.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who is trying to change for good or is interested in the topic for other reasons e.g. changing culture/habit of an organization.
0143123173|2.0|I wanted to like this book.  I like C. J. Box's Joe Pickett series and William Kent Krueger's Cork O'Connor series.  But, I did not enjoy reading The Cold Dish.  Perhaps, I am just not smart enough.  I guess I was expected to remember characters who were briefly introduced when their names came up again, but I didn't.  I had to go back and look up what I should have remembered about them.  I guess I was expected to understand who was speaking without the quotes being attributed to someone.  I could figure it out, but not without reading back over some sections again.  I guess I was expected to know when Walt was thinking back to a former time without being told. A few sentences in, I would figure it out, but until then I was confused.  Then, once I realized he was thinking back to a former time, I would need to go back and begin the paragraph again.  I know I was expected to \\"get\\" all of the literary allusions and be impressed with the author's knowledge, but I often didn't...and really wasn't.<br /><br />All in all, I didn't really enjoy it.  It was too much work for a leisurely read and not enough payoff.  It took me a while to actually finish it.  The murderer seemed pretty out of the blue to me as well.  Just a little hard to believe.  Also, I'm o.k. with starting the book with a depressed protagonist, but ending the book with him being so depressed again was a little disheartening.  I would have liked for him to have found a new lease on life.<br /><br />Perhaps, the books get better as you read further in the series.  I don't plan to find out for myself.  I'd rather spend time reading something I can just relax and enjoy.<br /><br />I must say that I do like the TV series based on the Longmire books and will probably watch the second season.

But, I did.<br /><br />The frustrating thing is that only two books are out (I have started Scarlet), so I realize I won't have closure until the end of the fourth book.  It's going to be a long wait.

B00BA5H3TU|5.0|I knew this album was good, but it was even better live.  I just got back from the Syracuse tour stop.  An unbelievable show.  It's a shame there were only 60 people there to see it.  The 60 who were there, though, will never forget the night.  First off, I was very impressed with \\"Jolly,\\" the opening band.  One of the best opening acts I've seen in a long time.  The members of Jolly came into the crowd about halfway though Riverside's set and were \\"slap air bassing\\" and \\"air keyboarding\\" along with the rest of us!<br /><br />My jaw dropped during Riverside's jamming at the end of \\"the Depth of Self Delusion (I believe it was.)\\"  I have never seen a bass guitar played like that.  The band was tight, energetic and sounded great.  They played 2 encores and came out and drank beer with us after the show.<br /><br />I can't wait to see Chicago's show.  This is a band at its very peak!  Thanks to Riverside for the many years of entertainment!  If there is any possible way you can see them, you owe it to yourself to do it!
B005ML9YOU|3.0|I have noticed a lot of typographic errors in this edition.  It is so irritating that I have stopped reading it.  I have purchased another edition which is a bit more expensive but which is of much higher quality.
193700788X|1.0|As I wrote on the author's facebook page, this book has left me extremely sad and disturbed. You can tell through her writing that she is over this series entirely as none of the characters got anywhere near a proper 'goodbye.'Not to mention the themes and 'morals' that this series seems to uphold is awful. The writing is something I would expect of a grade schooler, the holes in the story are countless and none of it makes sense. Nothing is answered in a final way at all. Not the way it should be in a series ending book. It really comes through that there is no love for the characters that she created, just a paycheck to be deposited. And that is a crying shame for a series as wonderful as this one had the potential to be. In the end, she has painted Sookie to be nothing more than an average trashy w****, that settles not for the one who loves her (that she professes her undying love for right before she sleeps with Sam) or finds a way to be with him, but for the only one left who will actually have her. She even had thoughts about sleeping with Bill again just to piss Eric off. I have never wanted to jump into a book and strangle someone as bad as I did her in this last book. And then Eric gets sold off into slavery, and Bill gets to tell Sookie all about the deal Eric made with Sam for him to stay away from Sookie. I really have never read a worse ending to a book series in my entire life. period. Don't waste your time and save your money. But if you must read it, try to find it for free b/c it isn't worth the 15.00 at all.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I chose this rating because this show is the best written show anywhere.  The whole family can watch this and enjoy.  It also shows a time in history when things were totally different.  A good lesson for all.  No sex, no cursing, no drugs, no stupidity.  Just really great story, drama and acting. Just watch one episode and if your not hooked, forget it!  Bit I can almost tell you that won't happen.

0064430170|3.0|Unfortunately the way the book was packaged, it arrived bent.  It's a gift for a soon-to-be mommy, so I hope I can I get rid of the crease by piling heavy items on top.  It's disappointing because I order books all the time, and I have never had a problem.

B00BSWMITK|3.0|He was really onto something with 'Wormhole Wizards' his best since Crystal Planet for sure.. Here we have another like 'Super Collosal' ~ not a bad album by any means but lacking 'that spark'.<br /><br />1. Unstoppable Momentum - better title track than Super Collosal but never really takes off..feels like it's stuck in neutral.. which is ironic based on the title. 3 out of 5<br /><br />2. Can't Go Back - a good track but it would be middling on Wormhole Wizards.. 3.5 out of 5<br /><br />3. Lies and Truths - great song, but lingers. Dun - dun nuh nuh -- dun - nuh nuh nuh......then it just trails off into Bland Land..and then the solo arrives and may be one of his best ever -- go figure. 3.5 out of 5<br /><br />4. Three Sheets to the Wind - this song is down right annoying - it will get under your skin in the worst way ~ just like when you have the icecream man song in your head all day ~ it is infectious - but in a bad way.. don't even listen to it!! n/a<br /><br />5. I'll Put a Stone On your Cairn - filler. Is this even a \\"song\\"? n/a<br /><br />6. A Door Into Summer - great song. very mellow, first heard this on you tube and hoped the rest of the album would be this great - it's not. 4 out of 5<br /><br />7. Shine on American Dreamer - or - Shine on American Filler. Safe. Seriously bland. I just get the idea that Joe probably has a thousand of 'these song types' in a vault somewhere. 2 out of 5<br /><br />8. Jumpin In - awesome intro groove! - then it repeats it. 3.75 out of 5<br /><br />9. Jumpin Out - another almost great song but it does sound like a reworking of Jumping In..seriously? There are only 11 songs here Joe! 3.5 out of 5<br /><br />10. The Weight of the World - Bland.. or boring - take your pick. Just drags - sorry Joe! 2.5 out of 5<br /><br />11. A Celebration - Now..this is a great song.. just too bad the rest of the album doesn't have this type of energy or urgency. Could win him a Grammy. Keep it simple stupid! 4.5 out of 5<br /><br />+much better than the near career ending disaster Engines of Creation ; A Celebration!<br />-barring a song or two there's nothing all that special here.

0374533571|1.0|A truly awful read. So far fetched and pointless. I kept hoping and expecting to get pulled in at some point, but it never happened. The characters were cardboard, the storyline was lame and not at all believable. I mean really? A normal man who has the ability to be married, hold a teaching job, own a home, etc. is reduced to a blithering idiot because he catches his wife cheating on him with another man? Seriously? He spends 4 years in a mental institution as a result? He's so fragile that they can't tell him his wife divorced him or even that his brother got married? He comes out talking like the Rainman? OoooOOOOooo, he was in \\"the bad place....\\" I know this because it was repeated about 300 times! And, he was just in \\"Apart-Time\\" from his wife.....again, 300 times. He has no memory of the break up? He only knows he that he reacts and has to hit himself in the head where the white scar is when he hears Kenny G.? Pluuueeese! All of this is repeated over and over and over again. Then throw in the unrelated football obsessions, exercise obsession, the mother always crying, the father always angry about football. The bizarre sister of a friend who follows him on his runs and is secretly (and predictably) in love with him. Lame, lame, lame. I hated that I paid for this and so forced myself to finish it, but I had to skim over much of it to keep from throwing my kindle across the room. I got through it, but it was like choking down liver and onions. Yuck!!!!!
B0073LWEXK|1.0|The game seems fun, but a lot of the text that comes up in the game has formatting issues.  This leads to words being on top of each other and unreadable on my transformer pad infinity.

B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This is one of those movies that you will want to own and watch often. It is well produced and the singing is great.
B003YYKPMM|5.0|We saw this on Netflix and had to own it.  The music is haunting.  The actresses take good parts and perform them well.  The romance is unusual, but probably more realistic than most movies.  Loved it all the way around.

B0013TXA5Y|4.0|This book started out a little generic to me with the girl doesn't know she's anything special and is trying to live a normal life when all of a sudden in her teenage years she learns that monsters exist and she's part of their world. Something happens and a family member is in trouble and she has to learn about her place in the world she didn't know existed in order to go to the rescue.  But that is pretty much where the clich&eacute; teenage fantasy novel plot building ends. The world in this novel is unique and exciting with a lot of aspects I haven't read about before. I admit the first part of this book took a while for me to follow because of the complex world building and learning about the Shadowhunters (demon hunters), the Downworlders (vampires, werewolves, fae, warlocks, etc), and everyone involved. There are items and concepts I am not familiar with and it took a while to grasp everything and have the world come together in my mind. But that is to be expected in a first book in a series, so I was patient with it.<br /><br />This is a story where the people who you think are dead might not really be dead, family connections are not what they initially seem,  and everyone has secrets.  I'm not going to include any spoilers in this review, so I will try to keep everything vague. Clary is learning about her new Shadowhunter friends: brother and sister Alec and Isabelle, and Jace, who is an orphan and has been raised by Alec and Isabelle's parents. Also, her best friend and mundane (completely human) best friend Simon refuses to be left out.  These are our main characters. Jace is instantly super protective of Clary and that doesn't get explained until later in the book when all the bombshells are dropped.  And let me tell you there are some pretty cool bombshells. There's also a bit of a Star Wars parallel between the characters but any more details than that would be spoilery. There's also a lot of unrequited love between many of the characters so we can't even really say there is a love interest or a love triangle because it is quite complex. Once the action gets started, everything moves pretty quickly with a lot of mystery and final realizations toward the end.<br /><br />I gave this book 4 stars but it might be more of a 3.75 rounded up. The world building does take a while and all the major plot development happens at the very end of the story. It definitely builds up and makes you want to read the next book to know what happens.eally say there is a love interest or a love triangle because it is quite complex.

B0007PAMR4|4.0|Personally, my beliefs rest with the opinion that a movie based on a book should be made in such a way that YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE READ THE FLIPPIN' BOOK TO UNDERSTAND THE FLIPPIN' MOVIE !<br /><br />I mean, if you have to have read the book, then the filmmakers have failed.  It's like the cliche' of the dream sequence.  If you've made that wrong turn, you are forever lost.  Makes sense, right ?<br /><br />Well, apparently, those who made this film did not share my opinion.  Thus until the Extended Cut, I honestly was very confused for many years.  Not about the broader strokes, but rather the subtleties and their meanings.  I just didn't get WTF was going on.  Until now.<br /><br />It may not be perfect, but the 3 hr. Extended Cut is the one to see.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|City of Ashes starts out with a an action scene and pretty much doesn't stop. While the first book was slower and focused more on developing the background, this book doesn't waste much time rehashing the world building and just jumps right in.  This book was definitely darker and more sinister than the first, with our villain Valentine going after another of the Mortal Instruments and murdering Downworlder children to use their blood for his evil plans. We also learn that Valentine did something to his children, even though he supposedly never even met Clary, and Jace and Clary discover their really cool abilities, somewhat accidentally on Clary's part, and are able to use them to fight back. I really like Clary's ability, she's definitely the more behind the scenes of the two since Jace is all about action, so I think their abilities fit them very well.<br /><br />I really enjoy dark and emotionally intense stories, that's why I prefer the paranormal genre - bad stuff happens to all my favorite characters and that makes it all the more fun to read. I love when my characters go through something so difficult and then are able to get past it and let it make them stronger. I think some of that is happening in this series.  Jace and Clary, who found out they're brother and sister at the end of book 1, are crazy in love with each other and don't know what to do about their forbidden romance. They're both fighting their feelings and trying to give into their feelings at different times in this book, and that was getting annoying to me. Unless the author is planning on having them get together despite everything, this brother-sister unrequited love plot line should stop. But this is probably the only thing I didn't like about the book. But back to the dark and emotionally intense - Simon! If you thought Simon getting turned into a rat and kidnapped in book 1 was bad, wow wait until you find out what happens to him in this book. I'm not going into any spoilers but omg I did not see any of that coming. Poor Simon! He really does go through a lot of.. um.. changes? in this book but I think in the end it will be alright. His story is definitely the most interesting one for me, with Clary's abilities a close second. I'm excited to read book 3 for next month's discussion, especially since this one ends in a bit of a cliffhanger about Jace and Clary's mother!id not see any of that coming. Poor Simon!

B00417HV14|5.0|Joe is one of the best guitar player I have ever seen, and he is really gifted and plays electric and classic guitar very well.
1442358238|1.0|I just finished listening to the book on CD.  It was way too long.  Information about the history of the characters and the facts of the crimes were constantly repeated over and over again.  And the answers to the \\"who done it\\" were totally predictable.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|This is another die hard, but with a twist. He has a son. It was all action. Kept you on your toes. So if you want action buy the movie.<br />Donna
B007THA4FI|1.0|I can't believe this book was written by the same person who gave the world Harry Potter!  It was so bad I could not finish it.  I was confused by the constant change of POV and the poorly written dialogue. I found it difficult to connect with any character because she was on to different one so quickly.<br /><br />What I find equally unbelievable is that someone actually published this!
B00CHVJODE|5.0|I love this movie. It was so funny and cute. You couldn't help love the whole family. Watched once by myself and two more times with my grandson and husband. Encourage all ages to watch. Good clean movie. About time.<br />Donna
B000YJ85BI|5.0|Great book. The whole series was very hard to put down.<br />Great mix of character development, believable SciFi plot and awesome action.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|I was looking for a replacement of my SkyCaddie (5) at renewal as I was tired of the ongoing fees and the constant loading and unloading of courses. I purchased the V2 as I didn't see the need for the slope capabilities in the V3 (and the issues that raises for tournament play).<br /><br />After reading some of the reviews here on Amazon, I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly the V2 generated its readings. The viewfinder makes it easy to center on your target. There is the occasional mis-read for an object behind the target (generally trees behind a flag) but you quickly become accustomed to taking a reading at the front of the green and then the flag if you ever question the reading. It takes just a few seconds and you become increasingly confident in what constitutes a good reading.  It is very good on standard flags and exceptional on flags with built in reflectors.  You can read off of just about anything (e.g. players on the green, carts, irrigation boxes, trees, etc). So you have a variety of options to determine yardage and the occasional 'bailout' location.<br /><br />The size is great and can be used single handed for most readings under 200 yards and dual handed for readings over 200 yards just for stabilization. An added bonus is the 7x magnification. I have found myself using the V2 just to see where a ball ends up on or near the green (these old eyes not working like they used to).<br /><br />The biggest difference over the SkyCaddie is the ability to get exact readings off of various target points on the course; whether it is a bunker or creek or other hazard.  With the SkyCaddie there always appeared to be a bit of 'wiggle room' depending on how well the course was mapped or the number of satellites your device was tying in to. With the V2 you just point and click and you know exactly the yardage you need to carry or lay up to. That aspect alone has saved me one to two strokes each round I've used the range finder as it has kept me from overshooting my layup location or under-clubbing when trying to carry a hazard.<br /><br />For those considering the switch from a GPS based device to a laser range finder, I highly recommend making the switch.  The only caution is if you tend to spray the ball quite a bit and find yourself behind a lot of trees or otherwise don't have good line of sight to your target, you may want to stick with the GPS.  For me, it was the best decision I've made in golf equipment purchases (which I had done it several renewals ago).

B009K45Y62|5.0|Great movie, a most buy! Love the movie stand, comes with 4 disc. Not large just the stand and the case that holds them.
193700788X|1.0|It's kind of mind-boggling that in order to stick to the ending she had in mind 10 or 11 years ago, this author had to ignore and erase a great amount of plotlines and things stated previously. Talk about continuity errors and character assassination!<br /><br />DEA simply negates the previous books.<br /><br />Ending with a resounding THUD, indeed.
0715338153|3.0|These lovely little books are beautiful. They have patterns. They just don't have ALL the patterns for the dolls/characters in the books. The cover of the Dolls book has a lovely doll with no pattern for the body and no pattern for the dress. Very very disappointed.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|What the title says...this game is pure fun and highly addictive. Once you get the hang of the easy controls, it's nothing but good times.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Perfect Watch for someone wanting an automatic watch that they can wear everyday.  It is my daily wearer!  Been wearing it for over a week since I got it with no adjustments necessary to the time - AKA very accurate for a mechanical timepiece.
B00555X8OA|3.0|The findings in the book are quite interesting, but the presentation is a lot like trying to eat all the items at Taco Bell. Every chapter is just a variation of the same five ingredients--some crunchy, and some soft.
B00B2270P8|4.0|My wishes were fulfilled on the only funny part in the book and they were submitted into this edition of the movie! If you have read the books, then you all know which part I am referring to when I say &#34;food bowl&#34; scene was hilarious! However there could have been a bit more insight in the movie that I missed a bit...more of Jacob's perspective from what was going on in the woods as well as the development of Jacob and Leah's relationship and understanding of each other. Other than that, it was a good movie and it had a few of the finer moments that were good...although, there could have been a bit more foreshadowing of the moment Alice mentioned the similarities Jacob and &#34;the fetus&#34; shared...unable to be seen and a blind spot for her visions...just IMO...either way, I guess from an outsider's perspective that has never read the stories, you would get the gist of the movies.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|I love this game it gives you unique animals that you can buy from gaining fish from racing on the ice. you should get it because its free and is really fun.  I play this when I get bored and I'm a gymnast so I have to travel and I play this all the time on my way there.
B00APUQJLO|3.0|The movie itself, isn't really that captivating...futuristic, yes, however, the movie itself, was a little hard to follow...not horrible...but not great. If you are wanting to watch this movie just because you like Robert Pattinson, you may be a little surprised at this type of film. DEFINITELY not his usual Dram-edy. Basically it's about a guy (newlywed Eric Packer (played by Pattinson) - a millionaire that thrives off of the stock market) who is a bit numb to his everyday life and he has a bit of a struggle with paranoia in aspect and attempts to fill a void from his jaded life.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Nothing like having  such a valuable resource so near at hand since dictionaries can be difficult to manage.  I have it on the phone and my tablet.

B004ZMWUCU|4.0|It's been a long time since a book has caused me to laugh out loud.  McKenna's  characters are delightful and I will miss them.  However be prepared for the flashbacks of the orphanage.  The author deals with the issues of abuse in a skillful  and sensitive manner.  She successfully balances those with her wonderful and hopeful cast of characters.  Thank you, Christina. I look forward to reading more from her!
B007SYWFRM|3.0|what can I say really. it an okay time wasting game and of course the app developers are money hungry and put in those near impossible to obtain acorns and then require ungodly amounts of them to be used for guest items and animals.
B00AFEYUVG|3.0|While I liked the film, I didn't feel entirely satisfied with it. Often, when that happens with a movie based upon a book, you have the option of reading the book to get the rest of the story. I was a little hesitant to do so with this one since this movie was actually directed by the original author. How different could it be. More than I could have imagined apparently. What often sets the way a book is told from a movie is the inner monologue. With the book being told with a series of letters from Charlie, it is essentially all inner monologue, it is his point of view on everything. You see him writing one of these letters in the opening of the film, but no further details is ever revealed in the movie at all about that. Granted it's the same story for the most part, with a few variations in details, it is just told from a different perspective. We are seeing it as it happens, not as Charlie reports and reacts to it. Without the additional details found only in the book, many of the events come off very differently. For me the film is but a cherry on top of the book, for the film just doesn't stand alone.
B002PEP4HI|5.0|The  Reb ...  So many feelings and emotions. Gives you a perspective on the challanges of dealing with getting old and the way we can handle it.  Faith, it's a small word but it has big consequences for with it you can face life head on and make the best of what you have been given.  Not to say you won't struggle, you will, but with Faith on your side you can come out of the darkness and into  The Light  !!!  It made me laugh; it made me cry; but most of all it touched my heart !
B009CG0102|5.0|Great, true story that highlights the incredible bravery of our astronauts & the tremendous technological feats of the Apollo program, while hinting at the creeping bureaucracy that eventually led to the Challenger and Columbia disasters. Fantastic family viewing, providing great role models and an opportunity to discuss many societal issues.
B006LR0XLM|3.0|If you have a folder with a lot of documents---don't use this.  But if you use folders with smaller amounts of data, this is fine.  It can be a little slow to load, but again, that just depends on how large the file is.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a great game! If you liked the first Temple Run,  then you'll love this version. Best game app IMO. ^^
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the series!  This one was a little harder to read than the first two, but it was still very good.  Very sad and dark to be sure, but good.  I may read all the again!
B004GBIE3Y|5.0|Lighthearted but also serious story about overcoming the stresses in life. Characters are not too complex but are well acted.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Ordered this for my batman/nolan freak boyfriend for his birthday. He looooved it. The box itself is awesome, holographic and shows the logos from all three movies. Movie case itself is quality and nicely done. Would have definitely been worth the money without the book included. The book, although small, sets it off. An awesome extra for batman fans. Definitely 5 stars all the way around.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is wonderful. Great for ages 16-100!!<br />The characters are easy to keep up, perfect way to kick<br />Off my summer reading

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I love everything about this book! It's descriptive, entertaining, and mysterious, and I swear, this is the book I've been looking for since forever! This is coming from the girl who hates fantasy and &#34;magical&#34; books. Jacob's story is so real, and I love it! Can't wait for book 2!!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I was looking for a nice logic puzzle to help me pass time on planes. This keeps me entertained for long enough to get me over bouts of boredom.

B002ZB26AO|4.0|For those interested in the strange world of North Korea,  this is an excellent read.  The author interviews a number of former citizens of North Korea who fled the country.  Its a telling account of their lives and strugles.  The author is a gifted story teller, so it is a compelling read.  She also covers the history of North Korea, and shows the impact to ordinary Koreans' lives.<br /><br />Highly recommend this book for students of North Korea society.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Always good with this game producer. They have made some of my favorite hidden object games. Not impossible to solve, but not too easy either.

193700788X|1.0|I feel like I wasted time, money and years on this series. I should have stopped reading and made my own ending.  Very disappointed.
B002FOQY2M|5.0|If you enjoyed \\"Some Nights\\" by Fun. then I think it's safe to assume that you will dig this album too. Same type of sound, same type of songs, hooks that stay with you, a feel-good vibe, and no filler. Like the other album, I detect more than a bit of Queen influence to their sound, but I like this band MUCH better than Queen; better songs and a less annoying lead vocalist (sorry, Freddie Mercury fans!). Very happy to hear new bands like Fun. that know how to write catchy pop tunes with a bit of bite to them. Another winner.
193700788X|1.0|It breaks my heart to read all of the reviews of this book, but so glad I read them before I clicked the button to buy. Sookie has been a part of my life for a very long time, but I cannot have what I have envisioned ruined by reading DEA. So long, CH. You have lost a long time fan...
B00CBKXGPI|4.0|I am enjoying this game immensely.  I have started having problems with it freezing up and yes, it was right after I purchased it.  I hope the bugs get fixed because I love this game.

B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is very engaging! constant INTERACTION; game does not freeze up. I highly recommend for<br /> all ages. very ADDICTIVE!!
B008K8H9C6|3.0|I was not able to see what needed to be done each time.  Not always clear on the objectives.  I think this is an opposite brain game from what my talents are.  It was fun on some levels, others made me cry.
B0031R5K72|3.0|This book is excellent and written in an original way ... it is though very sad and thus not my kind of reading.<br />Alex
B004SBS8LA|4.0|This was fun!  So much more fun than the original ones!  Love the music!  I had a blast!  The family had a tournament!  I won.  I guess that is what helped make it fun!
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|Very nice to have all the Star Trek movies together. I played them all in a marathon viewing and it was very enjoyable to me to see them in sequence all together for the first time. They have all held up very well, both stories and effects. I bought them at a huge discount, thanks Amazon!<br /><br />NB:<br /> - I am hearing impaired and prefer English subtitles to view. The subtitles are included on all of these movies! And on all of these the subtitles were complete and were accurate! (For those who don't know, CC is *NOT* subtitling and it usually is way, way off, incomplete, gives strange words and sentence structure, etc., so actual subtitling is indispensable to truly understand. CC is a VERY poor substitute and rarely even adequate.)<br /> - I prefer the later Director's Cut of Star Trek the Motion Picture version. This collection includes the original theatrical release version.<br /> - I viewed them on a dvd player and am planning on viewing them again through a BluRay to see how they look. I may now be spoiled by HD as they all seemed slightly fuzzy to me. I was distracted by actually being able to see the moving effects &#34;boxes&#34;, some kind of a visible distortion surrounding the effects in the Motion Picture.<br /><br />And just so other customers know, I received this order two days ahead of scheduled delivery which is always nice. But it wasn't packaged properly. The shipping box had a crushed corner, no padding inside the shipping box, so the dvd collection box's corner was also crushed.
0061353248|4.0|Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions by Dan Ariely<br /><br />\\"Predictably Irrational\\" is a fascinating look at irrational human behavior.  Professor of Psychology and Behavioral Economics at Duke University, Dan Ariely leads the readers on what makes us tick by presenting a wide range of scientific experiments, findings, and anecdotes that are amusing and enlightening.  This insightful 384-page book is composed of the following fifteen chapters: 1. The Truth about Relativity Why Everything Is Relative--Even When It Shouldn't Be, 2. The Fallacy of Supply and Demand Why the Price of Pearls--and Everything Else--Is Up in the Air, 3. The Cost of Zero Cost Why We Often Pay Too Much When We Pay Nothing, 4. The Cost of Social Norms Why We Are Happy to Do Things, but Not When We Are Paid to Do Them, 5. The Power of a Free Cookie, 6. The Influence of Arousal Why Hot Is Much Hotter Than We Realize, 7. The Problem of Procrastination and Self-Control Why We Can't Make Ourselves Do What We Want to Do, 8. The High Price of Ownership Why We Overvalue What We Have, 9. Keeping Doors Open Why Options Distract Us from Our Main Objective, 10. The Effect of Expectations Why the Mind Gets What It Expects, 11. The Power of Price Why a 50-Cent Aspirin Can Do What a Penny Aspirin Can't, 12. The Cycle of Distrust, 13.The Context of Our Character, Part I Why We Are Dishonest, and What We Can Do about It, 14. The Context of Our Character, Part II Why Dealing with Cash Makes Us More Honest, and 15. Beer and Free Lunches What Is Behavioral Economics, and Where Are the Free Lunches?<br /><br />Positives:<br />1. A well written, well-researched book.<br />2. Engaging prose. A page turner.<br />3. The fascinating topic of irrational behavior with a focus on behavior economics.<br />4. Great rhythm to the book.  The author does a wonderful job of keeping the readers' interest by jumping from one interesting topic to another.  He also ties every chapter together by summarizing the findings.<br />5. The book is full of interesting behavioral studies, and anecdotes.<br />6. The notion that we like to make decisions based on comparisons.  \\"This is the problem of relativity--we look at our decisions in a relative way and compare them locally to the available alternative.\\"<br />7. Great concepts are introduced like arbitrary coherence, \\"The basic idea of arbitrary coherence is this: although initial prices are \\"arbitrary,\\" once those prices are established in our minds they will shape not only present prices but also future prices (this makes them \\"coherent\\").\\"<br />8. The irrationality of FREE! \\"WHEN CHOOSING BETWEEN two products, then, we often overreact to the free one.\\"<br />9. The cost of social norms is a fantastic chapter, \\"The conclusion: no one is offended by a small gift, because even small gifts keep us in the social exchange world and away from market norms.\\"<br />10. When social norms clash with market rules, \\"The basic lesson, then, is that when we offer people a financial payment in a situation that is governed by social norms, the added payment could actually reduce their motivation to engage and help out.\\"<br />11. The influence of arousal, how emotions grab hold of us.  \\"In every case, our bright young participants answered the questions very differently when they were aroused from when they were in a \\"cold\\" state.\\"<br />12.  Interesting discussion on gratification and self-control.  \\"In order to overcome many types of human fallibility, I believe it's useful to look for tricks that match immediate, powerful, and positive reinforcements with the not-so-pleasant steps we have to take toward our long-term objectives.\\"<br />13. Understanding why we overvalue, \\"OUR PROPENSITY TO overvalue what we own is a basic human bias, and it reflects a more general tendency to fall in love with, and be overly optimistic about, anything that has to do with ourselves.\\"<br />14. The power of expectations. \\"As it turns out, positive expectations allow us to enjoy things more and improve our perception of the world around us.\\"<br />15. The power of placebos. \\"The truth is that placebos run on the power of suggestion. They are effective because people believe in them.\\"<br />16. Why we distrust, the tragedy of the commons. \\"But because human beings tend to focus on short-term benefits and our own immediate needs, such tragedies of the commons occur frequently.\\"<br />17. The issue of honesty. \\"...individuals are honest only to the extent that suits them (including their desire to please others).\\"<br />18.  Making it perfectly clear that economics makes a lot more sense if it were based on how people actually behave, instead of how they should behave.<br />19. A formal bibliography.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />1. Always take behavioral science with a grain of salt until we get a much stronger grasp on neuroscience.  Very little in this book is grounded in neuroscience.<br />2. The vast majority of the experiments were conducted with college kids, not what I consider representative of the whole population.<br />3. Some missed opportunities.  Very few big business applications.<br />4. Surprisingly, I thought the chapter on sexuality was one of the most predictable.<br />5. Always dangerous to mix politics and economics.<br /><br />In summary, what a fun way to learn about behavioral economics.  Professor Ariely is an engaging writer and has provided the reader a wide spectrum of experiments and anecdotes that are sure to amuse the public.

B004N66XYE|5.0|I should have done the research before I started watching this series.... apparently THIS is the last season as the BBC didn't renew the show for any more seasons after this one.  I very much enjoyed the series and am disappointed that this was the end.  It was an excellent filler for me in between seasons of Downton Abbey.<br /><br />I am happy to say though that with the end, it didn't really leave you with any cliff-hangers... it just left you with the option to make your own ending for each of the characters.
030746363X|5.0|Though I read it cover to cover, I did as Tim suggested and only used what applied to me. As a woman with hypothyroid, it was the eating and exercise that I was keen on. Since January 2013 (it's May), I've lost 25 pounds primarily using the eating plan (slow carb). I was a size 12. Now a size 7! My natural size is a 6. Talk about a revelation! And I never feel deprived because you get one day a week to eat whatever you wish. All day!<br /><br />Having tried many other plans (even P90X) in the past without success, this amazes me. The plan is easy to follow, takes little time. And it works! I've gotten away from it to a degree lately due to other issues (mental, not physical), but am getting back on the wagon.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this book.
0670014893|5.0|When we last were blessed with a John le Carr&eacute; novel, we were confronted with a question not often posed in espionage thrillers --- who is more immoral, the biggest money-launderer in Russia or a London banker? (Maybe the title will give you a clue: \\"Our Kind of Traitor.\\")<br /><br />Now comes his 23rd novel, \\"A Delicate Truth.\\" If you are hoping this title suggests le Carr&eacute; has written about espionage that is sophisticated and civilized --- espionage as an art form --- you should leave now with your illusions intact. In these pages, the dirty deeds are brutal and crude. And so is the cover-up.<br /><br />What is delicate? In these pages, most of the action occurs in England. For the first time in a le Carr&eacute; novel, it's Brit against Brit. They wear good clothes and went to good schools and they sure can talk the talk --- when they speak of protecting our freedom from terrorists, they're quite moving.<br /><br />So\\"delicate\\" is an irony. That cool English charm has worn thin. The bad guys? They're in the government, or were. Since the end of the Cold War, le Carr&eacute;'s books have been moving in this direction. It took George Bush (\\"The US has gone mad\\") and Tony Blair (\\"A leader who takes his country to war under false pretenses is simply not an acceptable person\\") to concentrate le Carr&eacute;'s disgust.<br /><br />Thrillers may be his traditional literary category, but that no longer describes his work. The author of \\"A Delicate Truth\\" has become a moralist, enraged that the powerful commit great crimes, lie and get away with it. In essence, he's writing the books that Charles Dickens would be writing now. For that alone, I say: three cheers.<br /><br />\\"A Delicate Truth\\" may be an angry book, but it begins like a le Carr&eacute; classic: It's 2008, we're in Gibraltar, and American mercenaries are attempting the rendition of some terrorists, using a British diplomat as cover. The operation goes wrong. le Carr&eacute;'s anger is about two unknown, unimportant people --- a woman and a child. In a world where Important People display \\"sheer, wanton, bloody indifference to anybody's interest but their own,\\" le Carr&eacute; still thinks individual human lives have value, that you and I are not \\"collateral damage.\\" How remarkable. How quaint.<br /><br />Inevitably, someone knows what really happened that night and wants to make it right. He's Toby Bell, of the British foreign service; he has a great future, he also wants \\"to make a difference.\\" Good luck to that. His mentor is Giles Oakley (\\"I wheedle, I chip away, I argue, I reason, I cajole, I hope. But I do not expect\\"). He must also contend with Jay --- \\"Jay\\" like \\"Gatsby\\" --- Crispin (\\"your normal, rootless, amoral, plausible, half-educated, nicely spoken frozen adolescent in a bespoke suit\\"). And there is an American woman, rich as Texas, who has predictably vile views and a willingness to finance their execution.<br /><br />You get the idea: The government has outsourced everything unpleasant, starting with war. \\"War's gone corporate, in case you haven't noticed,\\" says a British government minister. \\"Standing professional armies are a bust. Top-heavy, under-equipped . . . and cost a mint.\\"<br /><br />John le Carr&eacute; worked for MI5 and MI6 when it was possible to believe England and the United States were, more or less, the good guys and the Soviets were, more than less, villains. He had to quit in 1963, when \\"The Spy Who Came Into the Cold\\" was published.<br /><br />Half a century later some critics think he's become a crank. They don't say he can't plot, or create memorable characters, or make you stay up late gnawing at a knuckle while you race through his pages. Because he  can still do all that --- and more. As you can learn for yourself.a child.

Some management mishap of this sort apparently overtook Karajan and his family on one occasion, when the maestro was embarrassed about having promised an excursion to wife and daughters and couldn't find a buck in his wallet. But no sooner had he recognised the dilemma, than the solution offered itself. I'll just run over to the Philharmonie, he said to his wife, and make a record of Schubert's C major Symphony.

B000001G8R|4.0|Abbado: 4 1/2<br /><br />This is a triple review of Mendelssohn, Overtures<br />Masur, Gewandhausorchester Leipzig<br />Abbado, London Symphony<br />Flor, Bamberg Symphony<br /><br />Of the many and varied rivals, I pick Masur and Flor for comparison. Many others could have been chosen; but Mendelssohn Overtures are mostly placed as fillers on recordings of his symphonies, so the convenience offered by these discs is not inconsiderable.<br />The oldest, Masur with the Gewandhausorchester, is a lightweight affair, very carefully crafted, beautifully and spiritedly performed and well recorded. You don't expect great depths from these works, but splendid melodies and meticulous craftsmanship. Masur gives it to us in a recording that can hardly be faulted--which is not to say that when the occasion arises, he cannot unleash small storms of orchestral turmoil. The Midsummer Night's Dream is surely one of the best you are ever likely to hear; and his account of Melusine is not far behind. Which is not to say that the others are in any way inferior.<br />Flor's performances are on a similarly high level technically, and indeed better recorded. But I find that his care for nuances, almost self-understood with Masur, is not on quite the same level. There is, for such a young man, an astounding measure of routine here, as if he had played these a thousand times and conducted them from memory. In compensation the Bamberg Symphony produce a rich pallette of orchestral sounds, especially the winds, which enables you better than in Masur's recording, to follow the detailed strands of Mendelssohn's refined orchestration. On balance, however, this richness is for the ear alone. I find this album somewhat lacking in commitment, i.e. the conductor's sense of the necessity for one kind of phrasing over another in crucial moments of the musical argument seems to be driven by chance rather than design.<br />Abbado is even better recorded than Flor. His orchestra is set back from the mikes, so that a large aural space opens out that is most appealing to listener's who like to imagine themselves sitting in the best seats in the concert hall (rather than in the middle of the string corps). As a result, his readings acquire a grandeur that is missing from both his rivals. It is most telling in the Hebrides and Meeresstille Overtures which benefit most from a dense string sound. Ruy Blas is suitably dramatic with full round brass. Melusine is not quite on the same high level, and Midsummer Nights Dream, although exceedingly well played, sound a little too weighty, compared with the fleet performance of Masur.<br />Coming to conclusions: These are all fine recordings, though two are obviously a step higher on the rung than the third. Flor gets my lowest vote, even though (as I've already indicated) his performance gives a lot of pleasure. With Abbado, listeners will divide between those who prefer a large hall sound or a more intimate ambience. Some will feel that he is rather heavy handed with these overtures. I disagree, because I think Mendelssohn can take it, at least in some of these works. Which leaves us with Masur, who fills the gap between these two and might be felt preferable to both, firstly on account of his mastery of the Mendelssohnian idiom, secondly because of his sensible and refined craftsmanship, and also because of the recording which, although it is clear and detailed, does not draw attention to itself.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I had to read this just so I would know how it ended.  I found the storyline predictable and boring.  The entire plot felt very rushed.  It was easy to figure out who the murder victim would be and it was equally as easy to determine who the villains would be.  This series started out so wonderfully and it just felt like it was drawn out for too long.

B00969PR18|4.0|I had been wanting a map app for my kindle for those times I did not have access to wifi or 4g on my cellphone. This app is very good for what it is, though it is important to not overestimate it. It is not Google maps offline, nor is it a GPS device. If you need GPS, get a Garmin. This program gives you searchable, zoomable maps. It's not very robust at searching by content, but the address search is fine, and it's far better than trying to fold an old paper map. The app itself is free, and you can access all maps free so long as you have an internet connection. To get offline maps, which is the real reason anyone would use this over Google maps, is a in-app purchase, by country or state, as you need. I purchased the USA bundle and was very happy with it. To manage storage, you can choose to download all 50 states, or pick and choose, which I thought was a nice feature.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|It is rare for me to enjoy a book after I've seen the movie, but I really enjoyed this book, and I really enjoyed the movie too.  The development of these characters is masterful.  Quick writes with such simplicity especially the inner dialogue  of a broken man  those  sharing those thoughts we have that would embarrass us if anyone knew we had them.  Two broken, emotionally stuck people that find their way to truth and as an added bonus find each other. I'm so glad they are not alone and that Matthew Quick will surely write some more.

I paid $179 several years ago but the current price is not too high for what you get. This is the best way to get almost all of the great Beatles music. But in addition I would strongly suggest Ram and Tug of War by P. McCartney. These two extra CD's will convince you who the mastermind was behind the success of lyrics and vocals of the Beatles.
1400052181|3.0|This book was definately worth my time and I enjoyed the first half of it very much. I'm glad to know about the woman whose cancer cells have made such an important contribution to modern science. The story of the cells was spellbinding, entertaining and educational.  However, I don't think the last half of the book and the minutia was necessary or flattering to the family, most particularly Deborah. It was haunting though, particulary about what became of the daughter who was institutionalized.  The fact that Henrietta lost her battle with cancer and left children who grew up without her is a tragedy. Poverty and ignorance is an injustice and tragedy in our wealthy nation.  All of us, including her family, are served by the miracle of her cells and the brilliant scientists who use them for the benefit of mankind. I would recommend this book becauser the first half of it is great.

Tesla was certainly an intriguing fellow who would probably have helped the world even more had people had more faith in is style of genius. The \\"booklet\\" was interesting and challenging in areas of further thought.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|Disney's move of not including a regular blu-ray in the 3D blu-ray combo is a terrible idea. Collector's under temptation already to move to rental model such as netflix, are short changed by this move. Furthermore, it severely jeopardizes the adoption of 3D at home. The logic of issuing a blu-ray, dvd and digital copy in one set, to make sure a buyer can play the movie across the different players at home, but not doing the same on the 3D version is beyond me. It is not very likely that consumers at home have more than 1 3D TV or 3D player, and then are unable to play the movie in the rest of their home. Dumb move and hopefully Disney will re-think this strategy moving forward.

B009NY43NY|3.0|I've stuck out the series from the beginning, and knew there couldn't be a truly happy ending. Still, the whole book was one long and too-drawn out ending. Even the ending itself was abrupt and cut short. I think all Ms. Harris wanted to do was end the series; the book was dedicated to tying up all the loose ends of the series, and was very unsatisfying.<br /><br />**SPOILERS**<br /><br />Unlike many, I never thought she would end up with the vamps. I mean, it would be cool if she could just throw everything she'd set up about their personalities and made one (or both) swoop in to save/love Sookie. Sam was the only male option in the whole series that would/could give Sookie the normal life she wanted. It made sense to end with him, but the return to NORMAL was abrupt and, well, a let-down after the rollercoaster ride that was this series.<br /><br />**END SPOILERS**<br /><br />So while I can't give it a one-star, I can't bring myself to rate it much higher. It was BORING, but not horrible. Maybe it's because the series was dragged on so very long, but this seemed more like an afterthought than an ending.<br /><br />*sigh* Anyway, two-and-a-half stars, so I'll round it to three. But I'm still meh on everything, although I couldn't tell you where the series jumped the shark. I suppose I'm just glad it's over and can focus on the world of True Blood (which has gone so far off path as to be AU now).

1619491303|4.0|In the book, The Origin of Species by Charles Darwin, he presents his theory about evolution based on the idea of natural selection. As he explains, Darwin began developing his naturalist theories from the observations of numerous species in South America, as well as its nearby islands and recording data to help support his philosophy. From his studies and the similarities observed between species, Darwin concluded that they were not created independently by a single entity. Instead, he argues that each species are descended from one another. Naturalists at this time believed conditions like geography, climate, and food are the primary causes for the variation within species. However, Darwin's naturalist theory is formulated by a different idea. He believes that the primary factor for the evolution of species is variation passed on by parent organisms. From his studies, Darwin argues that the traits and variations that distinguish one species from another also play a key role in how they evolve and gradually deviate over time. Further, he argues, that variations in the characteristics of species are evident in organisms in both the natural world as well as those that are domesticated. This idea of developing variations in both settings provides significant evidence for Darwin's idea that the most influential aspect of variation in species is influence by heredity. Darwin thoroughly describes the importance of variation as it allows for species to adapt and survive in their natural environment as well as surviving the test of time.<br />Darwin argues that the most influential and important factor in the variation in species is reproduction. He argues that the mother and father pass on certain variations or traits that are preserved in later generations. As shown in his work, Darwin admits that science does not fully understand the process for which the laws of inheritance are perpetuated. He argues, for example, that science has not yet been able to explain how sometraits are passed to offspring and why other traits skip generations entirely, and reappear in the offspring's descendants. From a study conducted with the breeding of pigeons, Darwin concluded that species might have descended from one parent as opposed to multiple parent species. He goes further with this idea to discuss the influence that man can have on creation and the development of subspecies and even of new races. This is an important idea to consider because this suggests that in a controlled environment humans have the capability to choose which traits will survive and have an impact on future generations. He explains a practice known as \\"conscious selection\\", which is when a breeder selects desired traits within a species and breeds them with other desired types to create a large stock of these traits. Similarly, Darwin argues that domesticated species are also exposed to \\"unconscious selection\\", which is when come characteristics become prevalent without the influence of the breeder. As he describes, an example of this gradual change can be pointed out by the increase in size and speed of English racehorses as compared to their predecessors, which he argues occurs over numerous generations. This phenomenon is believed benefit different species by helping them withstand the challenges of nature.  Finally, he concludes from this gradual process that this may be the primary reason it is so difficult to determine the original lineage of a species.<br />Darwin also discusses the topic of Thomas Malthus's principle of exponential population growth. Darwin argues that population growth is directly influenced by geographical influences as well as the available natural resources. Due to the fact that natural resources are limited, he argues this will not allow an infinite number of organisms to survive because of the limited supply of water, food, shelter and so forth. This is where Darwin's idea of natural selection has its influence on various species.<br />Darwin believes that natural selection is the catalyst that leads to evolution or what he calls the \\"decent with modification\\".  This idea of evolution is built from the concept that species will repeatedly deliver variations to their offspring of which some of them will have advantageous influences and some of them will be detracting. As these advantageous and detracting adaptations are passed on to offspring, eventually variations will emerge creating a species of their own or bringing others to extinction. Darwin believes that this continual perpetuation of advantageous variations creates a branching effect known as evolution.<br />In this work, Darwin presents the reader with numerous examples of adaptations that allow species to adapt, survive and over generations evolve into the different types of organisms found in the world today. For Darwin, this theory of adaptation and evolution explains the origin of species. More importantly, however, Darwin strongly supports the idea of \\"natural selection\\" as the primary factor for the modifications and survival of earth's inhabitants. From Darwin's observations, he argues, that species are susceptible to this phenomenon and that it is the natural selection process that causes these adaptations to occur. He explains that advantageous variations of triats will be \\"naturally selected\\" over time and that these species will have the best possibility of survival. Darwin argues further that his naturalist theories will present a more in-depth understanding of the origin of species as well as revealing future possibilities to the modifications of the earth's inhabitants.

B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I have yet to read the books by J R R Tolkien, but I now find myself wanting to. When I do not know how a story ends it is difficult for me to wait for the next movie to come out! It is obvious to me that the actors have aged 11 years since doing the first trilogy and that they are trying to hide this fact with makeup. Even so, Cate Blanchett still looks pretty good to me. I am waiting to see if Liv Tyler is in any of the remaining movies.<br /><br />This movie tells how Bilbo Baggins got the ring of power in the first place and why he did not kill Gollum when he had the chance to. It also shows how the trolls got turned into stone and why the elves and dwarfs did not like each other when Gimli met Legolas. I am really looking forward to getting the rest of this tale!<br /><br />Mike Serovey, MA, MISM<br />Owner & Webmaster for Mike Serovey Reviews (website)

193700788X|1.0|Against my better judgement, I went ahead and bought and read this book. I wish I hadn't. After the last three books I should have known to expect more of the same, but at least more of the same would have been readable. Instead, DEA goes against everything from the other books. Charlaine Harris completely changes her characters, having them do a complete 180 to what all the other books have been.<br /><br />I admit, I'm an Eric lover. But, I'm realistic as well. I don't expect every book to go exactly the way I want it to go - if that were the case, I might as well just write the book myself. When I pick up a book, especially a series that I am willing to invest 13 books worth of time and money into, I expect to be taken on a journey that once concluded, leaves me wishing for more but at least knowing that all the loose ends are tied up nicely and everyone lives happily ever after in some way. Instead, this book completely goes against everything we the readers have been lead to through the progression of the story. Eric, who for 9 books was a complete bad a** who allowed no one to dictate rules but instead would fight tooth (fang) and nail to maintain his independence of himself, suddenly becomes a lost puppy, rolling over and allowing his stomach rubbed by anyone who commands it. This is the same Eric who defied the Queen even though he knew it would cost his life by telling Sookie about Bill's betrayal. The same Eric who again defied the Queen and her first (Andre) by blood binding himself to Sookie to protect her and who schemed the \\"marriage\\" in order for the same. The same Eric who deceived the King of Mississipi, entering his kingdom under false pretenses and a false name in order to keep Sookie safe. Suddenly, that Eric is gone, left with a sappy limp version of himself who is willing to do whatever he is told. The Marriage idea between Freya and Eric made no sense anyway after the series pretty much told us marriages for Kings and Queens were only a formality to strengthen the kingdom and reiterated over and over that sex between vampires for long periods of time were frowned upon in the vampire community.. What did Freya gain? What did Felipe gain by letting Eric go? Would Felipe honestly let both Eric AND Sookie go, knowing what assets he had with them? PLEASE!!!  Mrs Harris, I honestly think your readers understand your characters better than you do. The only thing this storyline accomplished was a sloppy way for you to tie your story into the conclusion you originally envisioned. The problem with this is, the original vision was thought out at book 1.. 9 other books (I'm not counting books 11, 12 and 13) unfortunately did not support this conclusion and the last few were so poorly written that the original conclusion Mrs Harris envisioned just did not work without alot of continuity errors, drastically changing the characters personalities, and just generally forcing things down the readers throats that weren't supported in the past.<br /><br />Mrs Harris has stated before she did not understand why readers felt so strong about Eric. But up until the last thee books, Eric seemed to be the only character who was true with himself and Sookie. He was the knight on the white horse, always there to protect her. I think the last few books were meant to make the readers start to dislike the character. Instead, it made the reader only dislike Mrs Harris for creating a character we enjoyed for so long only to change the character without warning and for no reason other than pave the way to her original (but highly unbelievable) ending.<br /><br />And it wasn't just Eric.. Other things in this book highly irked me.. One major one was the \\"sex scene\\" between Sam and Sookie. SERIOUSLY??? This read like it was written by a 12 year old boy trying to fit as many dirty words into a subject that he had no clue about but wanted to impress his friends. After somewhat well written sex scenes with Bill, Eric, and Quinn, this one readso sloppy. This was her way of trying to make us accept Sam as Sookie's HEA??  Another thing was about Amelia.. In the past, how many times had Sookie relied on Amelia's magical abilities to help figure out something important in the book. How many books did we hear how grateful Sookie was for the wards Amelia had placed on her home, wards that had protected her more than once? Yet, this book, time and time again, Sookie is thinking about Amelia's incompetence. When Amelia and Bob offer to once again ward the house, Sookie goes on and on about how Amelia's abilities are subpar. Should I mention that Amelia being pregnant but not knowing without Sookie telling her was in the realms of stupidity?? The girl's having morning sickness, feels bloated and hasn't had a menstral cycle, but didn't have a clue she was pregnant.. Then, there's Amelia's father and his driver, who never before showed any animosity towards Sookie in past books.  But suddenly, both want to kill Sookie with no reason that makes any sense. Johan wanting to kill Sookie made even less sense to be honest. (We're led to believe that he's upset because Sookie didn't rescue him and the Queen in Rhodes but instead chose to save Eric).<br /><br />I should also mention, this book is 3/4 of pointless fillers.. Quinn makes an appearance but really doesn't add anything to the story.. There's more writing about what Sookie cooks at meals, washing dishes and making her beds then there is character development. I think Sookie puts moisturizer on more than she actually has conversations with people. This book lacks any true substance which is one of the reasons I feel alot of people are so disappointed.<br /><br />This book sucks - pure and simple.. I think Mrs Harris lost her passion for these characters 4 books back but was contracted to write them and so she just threw together crap, published it and collected the paycheck.. But no matter how pretty of a bow you put on it, you can't polish a turd.. And the ending to this series is indeed that, a steaming pile of crap.
B000OZ0NXA|1.0|Deceived by reviews which said it was fast paced and a good read, I got the kindle version which is much more expensive than the paperback version (what is up with that pricing btw??). It is slow paced and obvious. In a vain attempt to pull me into the story, each moment drags by as excruciatingly boring details are driven home time after time. I was so disgusted that I just stopped reading it. In over 50 years of reading, that has happened only 3 times. If you do enjoy lively, fast moving mysteries with well developed characters and a hot romance thrown in, try the J.D. Robb books.

B000066C1N|3.0|Even as a longtime Disney fan, I greatly enjoyed DreamWorks Pictures' 2D animated features, especially \\"The Prince of Egypt\\" and \\"The Road to El Dorado.\\"  And while I found the story of \\"Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron\\" to be clich&eacute; and mediocre (essentially \\"Avatar\\" or \\"Dances With Wolves\\" but with horses in place of humans or aliens), the animation was incredible and I loved how expressive and communicative the horses managed to be without speaking.  My favorite part of the film by far was the soundtrack, however -- Hans Zimmer's majestic score soars, and while Bryan Adams is something of a \\"love him or hate him\\" singer, I thought his songs were a wonderful contribution to the soundtrack and complimented various scenes very nicely.<br /><br />When I acquired this CD, I imagined it would contain the songs and score from the movie.  Come to find out... I was half right.  All Bryan Adam's songs from the movie are on this CD.  But we only get the bare bones of Hans Zimmer's contributions, while the rest of the CD is padded with songs that aren't even in the film.<br /><br />Adams' music is very pop-ish, and his voice reminds me of a softer-sounding Rod Stewart with its gravelly undertones.  His songs in the film are some of my favorites by him, and most of them fit their respective scenes like a glove.  \\"Here I Am\\" evokes the innocent wonder of Spirit as a colt exploring the world around him, while \\"You Can't Take Me\\" signifies his desperate bids for freedom.  \\"Sound the Bugle\\" is a haunting, melancholy tune, and both \\"I Will Always Return\\" and its reprise evoke a majestic yet wistful feeling.  The only jarring number is \\"Get Off of My Back,\\" which, while a fun and energetic tune, sort of clashes with its respective scene.<br /><br />Sadly, we only get four tracks of Hans Zimmer's phenomenal score.  While those tracks are very good, I would have appreciated more of the orchestral score of the film on this CD.  In lieu of the score, however, we get some inane, pointless additions by Adams -- repeat versions of songs from the film and even songs that were never even in the film.  I don't know if these songs were cut from the final film or if they were just added to pad the length of the CD, but I feel they shouldn't have been added to the CD, and we should have gotten the orchestral score instead.  (Perhaps these \\"cut\\" songs could have been released on a separate album or as part of a \\"collector's edition\\" CD or something...)<br /><br />Also, the very first track on this CD is the \\"end title\\" version of \\"Here I Am\\" -- basically the song from the movie itself re-written and re-recorded as a pop-radio song.  Am I the only one bugged about this?  The original song was an ode to childhood wonder and curiosity, and altering the words to turn it into a generic love song feels like musical butchery to me.<br /><br />While I love the music on this CD that was actually featured in the movie, the fact that it contains so little of the orchestral score and is bloated with songs not even in the film proper makes me feel cheated.  I dearly wish there was a way to buy individual songs from this album so I can pick out the ones actually in the movie and ignore the rest, but sadly Amazon only allows an all-or-nothing option -- either buy the whole album or go without.  Disappointing.ess additions by Adams -- repeat versions of songs from the film and even songs that were never even in the film.

B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Powerful, intense and emotionally gripping. Dramatic performances by Washington and supporting cast members transport the viewers into the devastating and destructive world of alcoholism and addiction. The lethal, self-destructing disease ravages the human spirit of our heroes, heroines and the common, everyday people who share our lives. Somewhat overly dramatic performances by the actors portraying &#34;religious zealots&#34; and a surprisingly lack-luster performance by Cheadle as the Pilot's Union lawyer detract form the authenticity of the events portrayed in the film. Goodman's performance adds a touch of dark humor to the tragic events that unfold. The film, gritty in it's portrayal of human frailty, ultimately celebrates the strength of the human spirit.

B009NY43NY|2.0|I undertook 13 because I read 1-12.  I hoped since Ms. Harris has stated this would be the last book of the series that if she had one ounce of love and creativity left for the books that made her famous this would be the one to read.  However this was not the case. Such a bad ending for a series that started out so good.  The last 5 books were mediocre to awful but this one takes the cake.  I don't want to put spoilers in my review but I saw most of this coming after book 12 and I was hoping CH would change her mind and try to end the series amending the past wrongs but alas she has really forsaken her fans and her own characters leading me to believe more that she got lucky with her first couple of books.  I don't believe Ms. Harris ever really sat down and figured out who her characters are as people and has been winging it since.  Sookie has changed so much over the series that you could slap another name on her and call it a different series and no one could tell the difference.  I doubt seriously that if CH writes anything else that I will pick it up.  I can't see spending money on something that will leave me disappointed and miserable after reading.  Not to mention for 15 dollars her books are extremely short and lacking any substance to make them worth the price.  If you really, really want to read the last book for this series do so but my advice is pick up a copy at your local library, borrow it from a friend or wait for the paperback unless you are a collector of the hardbacks because the price tag really isn't worth it.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I just finished watching the first season and found the series very entertaining.<br /><br />However, I must warn people about the watchers who do exist in real life. After watching this show you will notice the watchers who actually are completely bald and wear nice suits with very nice hats (were do they get those hats ?) I often wondered about these folk prior to watching this show but now I know their purpose.

So, for Eric to actually marry that vampire and for Sookie to get together with Sam?! NOW?!! How many books have there been? Exactly. She has never moved beyond kissing Sam. It's just disappointing. Like...falling in love with your brother.
1250004217|3.0|I must say Sarah's Key held my attention and kept me reading.  That is sometimes a good sign.  Unfortunately, in this case, I felt a bit abused.  The two plot lines do intertwine well, as long as they go.  However, after the first half of the book, Sarah's story faded into a plot device rather than a separate story and it all turned rather soap opera-ish and too predictable.  Some of the writing was very good but too much was rather weak.  However, this would be an accessible read for younger readers who have not been exposed to much holocaust literature.  To me, it would be an appropriate read for high school level readers.

0895260131|1.0|This book was written with pre-conceived ideas and agendas.  The prejudice and ignorant masses will eat this up, but any one with an objective and truth seeking mind will realize that all the Quranic quotes and Hadiths are taken out of context to the tenth degree.  One could easily write the same book about Christianity.  Yes you can for those that doubt that.  Muslims are at a low in their history and people like Spencer are more than happy to take advantage of their vulnerabilities.  If you want truth, look elsewhere.  If you want BS talking points about why Muslims are evil, than this is a good source.
B009CV7IIA|5.0|I really loved this book. It's got a great blend of science fiction and 80s nostalgia, all wrapped together in a plot that moves like a roller coaster.<br /><br />In 2044, most of humanity is plugged into a virtual world called OASIS, the brainchild of a genius named Jim Halliday, who was raised in small town America and was a child of the 80s. Halliday, before his death, left a series of puzzles and clues that would lead one lucky player to his fortune. Wade Watts (nee Parzival) wants to be the first to find this treasure, and does find and solve the first of many puzzles. Now the world is watching. Wade's friends Aech and pseudo-girlfriend Art3mis aid him, and he meets up with other virtual warriors (Daito and Shoto).  However, a large corporation, IOI, led by a man named Sorrento, also wants to find Halliday's fortune and they've got the firepower and resources to do it.<br /><br />The characters are all likable (with the exception of Sorrento) and the 80s nostalgia is amusing (Halliday codes his puzzles with dialogue from 80s films like 'WarGames'). The pacing is brisk; once Wade finds the puzzles, the action starts and doesn't really stop until the conclusion, where Wade must solve the final puzzle. The author thanks several movie executives in the acknowledgements, and I truly hope this book is made into a film. I can't tell which I'd rather watch first: this, or \\"Robopocalypse.\\"<br /><br />This book is highly recommended. It doesn't matter if you're a diehard gamer, an 80s child, or a WoW guild member. Even if your only exposure to video games was watching \\"Wreck-It Ralph\\" in theaters last year, read this book; you will not be disappointed.
193700788X|1.0|This book is seriously NOT worth your money.  It's a disappointing, wheedling, disgusting, irritating pile of wasted wood by-products.<br /><br />To end the SVM stories this way is a travesty and the way the 'author' treats the characters should be considered criminal.  Throughout the series she grew the lead characters, Eric and Sookie, in such a way as to lead even them most inattentive readers into believing that they would end up together - and then she completely emasculates Eric and turns Sookie into the kind of slug willing to settle for everything she never wanted.<br /><br />She made Sookie into the kind of fool who would befriend her rapist (Bill).<br />She sold Eric into 200 years of useless slavery for absolutely no good reason.<br />She made Sookie settle for Sam - known throughout the books as ONLY her friend and boss.<br />She made Sookie endure a very publicly humiliating divorce AND had her banned, also publicly, from Fangtasia.<br /><br />No where in the previous books had she ever once hinted that Sookie and Sam would EVER become more than friends, and so many places she made a point to have Sookie with Eric, yet she does an unforgivable 180* and hooks her up with the dog.<br /><br />I feel that she purposefully cheated us out of a good story, lied to us about Eric, and did so solely for greed.<br /><br />Every character seemed \\"off\\" - their interactions seemed forced and unimaginative, and the plot was scanty at best.  It felt like she had lost all interest in writing this fiasco and should have taken up pottery instead.<br /><br />I suggest re-purchasing Twilight instead of this mess - at least the sparkly emo vamps there stay true to character....and I hate Twilight.

0061186473|3.0|I read the graveyard book 1st, which was SO captivating. I  have to admit that im disappointed with this one. It's basically fairy tales revisited and doctored up. Like humpty dumpty and the troll under the bridge.
0399226907|5.0|For some reason this has caught the attention of kids as noted from multiple other reviews. It might have to do with the graphics or the way the book is designed with the cut out holes dealing with the whole lot of food that the Very Hungry Caterpillar eats on a particular day! I end up reading it about 10 times a day!!
B00BPWDMP2|4.0|This is yet another great fourth studio album by the very successful and popular country-pop trio Lady Antebellum. The 7 times Grammy Award winners had a X-mas album (covers) in 2012 titled 'On This Winter's Night'. Fans have waited since their 2011 CD release 'Own The Night' for new material. The new CD release is titled 'Golden' (12 new tracks) and the trio has decided to use less instruments during the recording process : but their music is still sound great despite this change from this talented bunch.<br /><br />Stand-outs/gems/my favourites are \\"Nothin' Like The First Time\\" (wonderful melody & vocals; great guitar & drums playing), \\"Better Off Now (That You're Gone)\\", \\"Long Teenage Goodbye\\" (mid-tempo track with great melody) & \\"Better Man\\" (beautiful guitar work & melody). Good tracks include the opening track \\"Get To Me\\" (great harmonies), \\"Goodbye Town\\" (this is the second single from this album), \\"It Ain't Pretty\\" (slow-tempo track), \\"Can't Stand The Rain\\", \\"Golden\\" (slow-tempo-ed title track) & the closing track \\"Generation Away\\". Okay tracks are \\"Downtown\\" (this is the first single) & \\"All For Love\\".<br /><br />On overall, Lady Antebellum does not disappoint in this new CD release 'Golden', great compositions, execution and production. A recommended CD listening.
0449011909|2.0|I'm sorry, but I'm trying to enjoy this audiobook and finding the reader's character voices to be overdone, distracting, and unnecessary - they don't add to the story and I find myself losing concentration often to marvel at how much effort the voice talent seems to be putting into messing up what would otherwise be a great story. Just to take it down a few notches in terms of uniqueness for each voice would make the audiobook far more listenable, for me. The dramatic energy put into the voices may enhance the experience for some if it's subtle, but to me, it just keeps attracting attention to itself because it's so over-the-top in many cases. I know this narrator is talented, far more talented than I'll ever be in terms of voices. What I'd like to urge the narrator and the producers for further projects is to know when enough is enough, and when it's just too much.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I resisted seeing the movie, as reviews weren't encouraging.  However, since the movie director was nominated for an Academy Award, I thought I should at least read the book.  A compelling read, and I enjoyed it.  A very imaginative scenario, presented plausibly.  I'd recommend it for its ability to engross and paint vivid mental images.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great read.<br />...finished it in less then 2 days.....these guys are the real deal we are blessed to have them

B00BWBHIUG|5.0|It's easy to play and it's the first game I've seen that you can progress through without having to buy extras. It takes a few days, but you can collect pearls from fish instead of starting with 10 and never earning anymore.
B001DM1VXE|2.0|I read the other rave reviews and had high hopes.  I kept watching waiting for the movie to get to the good parts, but there were none.  Two stars is me being generous too.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|I really love this app. I have it on all my devices and my kindle Fire of course.<br /><br />What would really put this over the top is a widget for my phone's home screen.<br /><br />Or an app developed just for this that can be downloaded separately.<br /><br />I would love to be able to read directly from my home screen. and to browse my books that way too.
B00009RDGA|5.0|Very good movie and high quality DVD.  This is a movie that would not be suitable for children under about 12 so parental guidence.  I was happy with the quality and content!  Thanks!
B00BQ1DBUS|4.0|I'm a big Rod Stewart fan, in fact, some of my friends and I actually met him once when he was in his 20's. We sneaked into a party in Madison Sq Garden after the Smile's As Good As A Wink tour and Stewart hung around and talked to us for about 20 minutes or so. He was quite humble and gracious. This cd is a collaboration of sorts because he has song writing partners on the songs (except for the Tom Waits cover). Co-producer Kevin Savigar also co-wrote most of these songs and is obviously very talented. The songs are heartfelt odes to Stewart's failed marriage, his children, his career, his past loves. There are some very good songs here. This is a bit surprising because very few song writers have any originality left when they're in their 60's. Almost all song writers write their best songs in their 20's. Think of all of the top songwriters, Billy Joel, Elton John, Paul Simon, Carol King, etc., they wrote all of their classic songs before the age of 30. For Stewart to come out with such a solid album at his age, which I believe is 68, is a testament to his talent. He was always an underrated song writer. The music production is good but a bit vanilla. It's produced to be popular to the masses. This is my only complaint and why I would not give it 5 stars. When Stewart recorded his great albums like Gasoline Alley, Every Picture Tells A Story, Never A Dull Moment, the music was original and sounded unique and raw. This music sounds like his latter stuff, basically recorded with a slick group of studio musicians with the goal to make the music sound as contemporary as possible. But, it's a good album with about a half dozen very good new songs. As for the vocals, it's Rod Stewart, and he is a great singer.
B00AKFG15S|5.0|Jeffrey Archer is a great story teller! Once again he leaves us in suspence, impatient for the next book in the Clifton Chronicles. He keeps the characters and their personalities plausible.
B0083Z614S|5.0|A wonderful book of the human spirit! We can feel a great joy in following this tale of enlightenment through the eyes of children.
B0070DOHQS|4.0|Get online anywhere in life. Make it easier for yourself and get this program or something similar. It will work on mac or windows. I use it on my smartphone and connect to my pc and my mac and can control anything but there is a little bit of a lag.
B002SAUCBC|5.0|I've read this book several times and it never fails to move me.  Are the things we hold on high really what what we want?  One of King's best books. Lets hope they never make it into a movie.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a cute rom-com type book. I liked it! I mean, we've seen those movies where at some point they've gotten so drunk that they've hooked up and gotten hitched? Well, what if the next day the person next to you said they wanted to stay that way? One person is in all the way, the other needs conjoled.<br /><br />I really don't want to give anything away, just know that the writer does a great job of making her world easy to walk into. I could easily see this book being made into a movie. It was funny and witty. Yes, there were romantic moments- racy even- but not super smutty. Think Lifetime movie. These two Megan and Connor were great together, and each had side characters of their own.<br /><br />I will be looking forward to reading more books like this one.
B0064P287I|5.0|If you are a Rush fan and missed this tour then I highly recommend this blu-ray. Great song selection  and love the stage show.

B0073RBQY2|4.0|The pterosaur in Schleich's collection is excellent in terms of accuracy but if only the did not cock its head back(this is impossible on the real creature)<br /><br />Unlike all the other models in Schleich's collection, this one is made out of a thinner plastic that I advise NOT to give to kids who love to beat the detail out of there toys at play time (really I should say this for all of there models, as one reviewer of there Allosaurus clearly found out).<br /><br />The one thing I dislike about this figure is not the color scheme, but the pattern that's on the wings, which are reminiscent of a monarch butterfly. We may never know what the pattern on this pterosaur looked like in real life, but I doubt that it looks this similar to a creature who's a part of a compltely different group of animals.
B005LAJ212|4.0|The acting and writing are quite good and kept my interest and my wife's interest throughout.  The last few episodes seem different from the first 15-18, as it seems like the writers changed direction.<br /><br />However, the DVD set has problems.  Five or six of the episodes get the audio seriously out of sync with the video for the last 5 or 10 minutes of the episode.  The dialog is several seconds out of sync from the video.  It's as though they cut a few seconds from the video, but forgot to do so to the audio.  Not every episode -- just a few.
140120841X|5.0|Although I heard of the book for years, it took me a while to read it. The movie did a huge part in getting me to finally get into it. Admittedly, I'm halfway through but the book is such an engrossing tale where a terrorist is basically branded a hero in a world turned upside down from our own world today. If you've seen the movie, there are definitely some overlapping moments, but it definitely seems different even though I've read up to the halfway mark. I think even if you're not into comics or superhero, one can appreciate this work of body.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like the Easy tap feature and the quick moves make it entertaining to play many times. I recommend it.
B002O3Z4QQ|4.0|HBO always makes solid mini-series and this is no exception. It's a great depiction of America's race to the moon that's well acted, well shot, and well told. The collection itself could use a refresher. Some of the special features look really dated with its lower than standard quality. Still, it's a purchase worthy of any collection.
B0050DZ8J0|1.0|I have always had problems logging in to the linked in application, I get the email notifications but itwont let me log in from that way
B0085A9HXS|4.0|This is one of those movies I recommend to people and they come back thanking me for it. It's something different compared to the usual Hollywood action movie fare. Great plot and terrifically choreographed fight sequences make this a worthy blind buy.<br /><br />Only thing that might deter some people are the EXTREMELY graphic violence depicted on-screen. I usually don't mind stuff like that as long as it's justified and relevant to the story. But those with queasy stomachs might want to think twice before buying this.<br /><br />Other than that, it's a must-buy for any movie buff. Those who saw Dredd (highly underrated film, btw) pointed out the similarity in plot. But The Raid stands on its own.
B000003N7F|5.0|Com'on - Gold, Silver, Guns, Bullets, Liquor and Records (vinyl)!<br /><br />If you can afford it buy this record, classic real American history!

B00ACBN9CI|3.0|Ok well I think it is ok but the controls suck bad but other than that it is ok I love the graphics they r cool but when u get into the game it wants u to buy the full version and u can't play the missions over so all in all good game just the handling for the planes suck dramatically.

B0002PZVHK|5.0|I first heard this album back in the 80's. I had already become a huge Eno/Ambient Fan. However this particular track from this album is my favorite. Perhaps becuase of the time I spent overseas or that I was released from the shackles of musical peer pressure way back when. The entire album is good but as I said this track has special significance for me.
B0085Z3AMW|5.0|this is a great movie, and looks great on blu-ray! I'm very I got this. I love it! thank you!
B009NY43NY|1.0|Full disclosure:  I am not buying this book, but to those of you giving the book 1 star or less, I just wanted to remind you that books can be returned.  I find it interesting that some are rushing in to say that it's Ms. Harris' story and she can tell it how she likes.  True.  Though she has changed her sacred story at the behest of others before--like keeping Bill alive which went against HER STORY and extending the series past her preference--for which it seems obvious she didn't put her heart into doing, at least in the last 2 books.  Is it really okay that she can't remember her own mythology and character traits, etc?  Never mind the character assasinations and miserable outcomes!  So, I encourage all of you, those who might buy the book and those who have and don't want it--to use your power as consumers!  Your purchase is the only way she and her publisher will feel rewarded for the \\"art\\" they have bestowed upon you.  You can use that buying power to deliver a powerful message.<br /><br />I, for one, was not invested in who she ended up with.  For me, it's about taking a journey w/ characters--watching them evolve into something.  This series could have ended w/ the first book and made much more sense.  Another reviewer said it best:  If she'd written Harry Potter, the series would have ended w/ him back at his mean aunt's house, living in the hovel under her stairs.<br /><br />For those of you who enjoy this book, I'm happy for you. For those who did not--YOU CAN RETURN IT AND BUY ANOTHER BOOK BY ANOTHER AUTHOR!  There are lots of great stories out there.  At least w/ the SVM ending, it will make more room for those.
1451673442|5.0|I wish you have this book in audio too.<br />I also bought it in Spanish.<br />I read it with my husband and we got good results since the first week
193700788X|2.0|Honestly I was so disappointed I cried. Why Ms. Harris choose this path I do not know. I've been waiting forever for this book to come out. Seriously how could she destroy the one solid relationship and substitute another of oops didn't know you were the love of my life all along. I've been a loyal reader throughout the series and feel tremendously let down. The plot s dreadful. I know she had to bring the series to a close but it was the wrong choice. Sorry Ms. Harris but I believe many of us will feel the same way.<br /><br />I hope that the 'next phase of happily ever afters' that is supposed to come out will justify why she choose this path.
B0012HRJEA|4.0|Luhrmann somewhat met Shakespeare's intentions.  The dialogue in the movie and the play were similar, however Luhrmann did leave out some aspects of the play.  In the fight scene in which both Mercutio and Tybalt are killed, Tybalt was not accidentally killed like in the play--Luhrmann portrayed Tybalt's death as a result of Romeo's rage over Mercutio's death.<br /><br />While it may have been more dramatic and romantic, the balcony scene in the movie occurred in the pool in the Capulet estate in the movie.  Having the balcony scene in the pool created more suspense, but didn't match with Shakespeare's intentions.  Having the scene occur on the balcony showed Romeo and Juliet's true love and the distance keeping them apart.<br /><br />In the book, Juliet was discovered \\"dead\\" by the nurse then her family came to her room and expressed their sorrow.  Luhrmann, however, decided not to include Juliet's family discovering her \\"dead\\" in his film.  In doing this, the movie audience missed out on seeing Juliet's family as they were grieving over her death and expressing their love for Juliet, especially Lord Capulet as he had been very upset with Juliet earlier in the play when she expressed that she did not wish to marry Paris.<br /><br />Luhrmann did accurately portray the main characters.  Many of the scenes were also accurately portrayed, like the fight between the Montagues and Capulets in the first scene of the play.  The brawl in the book and in the movie both started with the biting of a thumb.<br /><br />Luhrmann's modern portrayal of Romeo and Juliet with Shakespearean dialogue made the movie comical.  Because Shakespeare focused on writing tragedies, he might not approve of this comical spin on the play.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I absolutely love this game. The gameplay is completely unique yet addictive. Actually incorporates<br />being creative into the challenge. Smooth running with adorable graphics. Highly recommend for anyone who likes problem solving puzzles. Great family game without being too easy or repetitive.
0525953728|5.0|This was an excellent book and inside look into the events of the bin laden raid. It's a must read
B00CL0J99K|4.0|Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.<br /><br />Coming off of last year's crossover film, Marvel's The Avengers, Iron Man 3 sets the stage for Phase 2 of this generation's Marvel films. It's been three years since fans have received the lukewarm Iron Man 2 and the third entry in the series attempts to right its predecessors wrongs. The end result is one with a lot of passion, but also one filled with many mistakes.<br /><br />The story is more emotionally driven this time around as we follow a troubled Tony Stark trying to cope during the aftermath of the events in New York. He can't sleep and when he does his dreams are filled with nightmares. To help keep his mind off of things he's constantly recreating new models of his suit. He keeps telling Pepper that it's a hobby, but it's pretty clear that this is nothing more than a distraction and, to some degree, an obsession.<br /><br />After the more lighthearted execution of The Avengers film, this darker story might not fare well with the younger audience, but fear not, Iron Man 3 is not without its laughs. Even though Tony is a bit troubled this time around, he's still Tony. So you can still expect his snarky, sarcastic humor. While I found most of the jokes to be fairly entertaining, there were some bits that felt slightly corny and a little bit unnecessary. A good example would be in the beginning as Tony is trying on a new suit. It'll get laughs from the younger crowd, but I couldn't muster more than an awkward sigh.<br /><br />Overall I found the story enjoyable and I thought the more emotional side of Tony was a nice break from the usual stuff we've received thus far. With that said, some of the scenes in here are extremely cliched and formulaic. What's that? Iron Man fell in the ocean? Oh, how about we get him stuck beneath a metal rod as a huge chunk of cement comes crashing down above him. I'm sorry, what was that? Tony ignores an eager young scientist over a decade ago and he's out to seek revenge? Who would've seen that coming?<br /><br />While the story in this entry is much more enjoyable than the one present in Iron Man 2, this third installment suffers from the same fate as its origin story: the lack of an interesting villain. Technically this film has two villains. Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) and The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) are the antagonists this time around and they're about as interesting as a sack of potatoes. Killian's character is your recycled fanboy who seeks revenge on the evil idol who payed him no attention and The Mandarin is just a joke. In the comics The Mandarin is a serious force to be reckoned with, but here? He's nothing more than a feeble attempt at gaining some laughs from the crowd.<br /><br />One of the things I found most odd about Iron Man 3 was, surprisingly, the lack of Iron Man. Now Tony's in a good 85-90% of the scenes in this film, but Iron Man? It felt like he got put on the back burner appearing in maybe 25% of the scenes. I think they tried to hold off in anticipation for the big finale, but it just wasn't the same as seeing Tony flying around in the suit. There's a lot of down time where the suit he's with just isn't functioning properly (at the worst possible times of course), adding another layer of cliche to the story.<br /><br />Finally, as expected, the cast in here is pretty great. Robery Downey, Jr. came through with another fantastic performance as Tony and Gwyneth Paltrow might have given her best performance of this series getting a lot more screen time and having a bigger role in the story. Don Cheadle finally found his groove as Rhodey, giving a much more enjoyable performance than the uncomfortable effort in Iron Man 2. Guy Pearce did a great job as Killian and Ty Simpkins was a nice touch as the young Harley who assists the troubled Tony Stark.<br /><br />Overall Score: 7/10 - If you can't tell already I'm about as neutral as neutral can get. The writing for Tony's little side story is very well done,but the main story with these two villains is pretty sub-par. The lead performances from Downey and Paltrow were excellent, but the lack of screen time for Iron Man wasn't. The action was intense, but cliched at times. In short, it was an Iron Man film. We have yet to receive an entry to this series that has been mind blowing, but what makes these so enjoyable is the fact that Robert Downey, Jr. is Iron Man. He is Tony Stark. There's no denying that he was made for this role and I think that's why I keep coming back. If you're looking for a good popcorn flick with a touch of heart then I would say see this. Because as flawed as it is, it's a nice ride.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|Ms.Reichs is a great writer. She gives insights into the body and investigating deaths very detailed and interesting to the lay person.I love her books.
B002VISNAS|5.0|This is one OS those books that validates some of those things we already sorta know. It then explores the strengths and weaknesses of our instincts, leaving us with a great sense of when to trust and when not to trust our instincts. It's also well written and entertaining. I recommend it.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I'm 74 and am addicted to these challenging puzzles. Sometimes they seem impossible and then I accidentally conquer it. Love it!
B009G8GRX6|5.0|Madness is a fantastic tune, which is why I bought the album. I was pleased with the other songs as well as they are great. If you like Madness, I'm pretty sure you'll want the entire album as all of their songs are great.
B00785P2QC|5.0|LOVE the way they made it so realistic,<br /> and I don't have to be playing the game to earn money. This makes it a bit too easy though, I like the layout, and I don't think that any other game as well done as this is out there.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I'm a fan of the Angry Birds series. It's a great way to kill time. Above the other games in the series though, this one has the best backgrounds. It's a lot of fun to play. I'd recommend it to anyone!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is simply amazing. I mean I don't know anyone who has said anything bad. A good game and money well spent.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's amazing to me that you can put a game like Minecraft on a cell phone. It feels like Minecraft as well! The controls are a bit interesting to get used to, but after a few minutes your are mining away.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I choose this rating because I think the book has a great story altogether. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys learning about Greek mythology or just thinks the story is entertaining. It's just a great book. Good Rick Riordan
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I'm not a big book reader, but I really enjoyed reading this Ebook. A friend recommended it to me several years ago and I found it on amazon, so I decided to get it and read it. Glad I did.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The book \\"diary of a wimpy kid the third wheel\\" is a really good and funny book. I really enjoyed it a lot. :)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is an outstanding ending to this series.  It could not have been better written and I think any fan of The Hunger Games will find it perfectly satisfying.  Highly recommended, although if you've read the first two installments, you don't require a recommendation, so what are you doing?  Stop reading this drivel and go find out what happens to Katniss!
B009GEDP26|5.0|Clever dialog and great chemistry between the characters keeps me watching. One of my favorite shows this year. Waiting to see what spin they throw in next season.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Amazing book. A very well written manual for any runner! Inspirational and true! Chris brings together the story of many, including his own, creating a unique and true to life tale.
B009IF82SK|5.0|Being in the &#34;science biz&#34; it is nice to see a show that we can laugh and has some interesting humor. As in any sitcom the characters are overdone but this one seems more cleverly done than most. Watch the knickknacks in set, there are many current and classic items from science and regular culture thrown in.
0062014102|4.0|Simple explanations and easy to read. Easy to understand explanation of holograms and how this might effect and influence the universe we live in. It lacked one thing. How the holographic principle was arrived at by physicists and what makes it work on a cosmological scale.
1594204217|5.0|History, cultural anthropology, recipes and techniques that have stood the test of time, in fact of centuries. And funny, informative, mouth watering.
B001DM1VXE|4.0|Outside the box, quirky, psychological thriller. Filmed in bright black and white it's a little hard on the eyes but is not a run of the mill science thriller. It only cost $60,000 to make but is well done. It seems they made the most of what they had. A computer genius and star pupil mathematician looks for an equation that will predict and map patterns for everything in the universe. He tests his equations on the stock market to verify his work. Suddenly the massive computer spits out a 216 digit number and crashes. He decides it was just a glitch and the 216 digit number was meaningless. Or was it? Some mysterious events follow involving his mathematics professor, corporate types, and religious types. Off the wall and over the top movie.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This book, while keeping the reader's interest, does little in the way making it a memorable finale. I fact, it feels like the latter half of the book all ha opened too quickly, with glaring details being lefts unaddressed. For its target audience, this probably won't matter, but for mor experienced readers, this will leave you wanting.<br /><br />Read if you've read the last couple of books, but this is by no means a masterpiece.
B0053PTO7M|5.0|Incredible movie. Incredible Steel Book, A Gnarly an epic buy. Highly recommended. Blu-Ray is \\"REGION FREE\\" which would work on any major Blu-Ray player or PS3. But I love this flick it is the best installment of the franchise, to me.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Bought these for my gamer boyfriend, he LOVES them. They stay charged for a long time, and the cord to plug them in when they die is also very convienant. He games in the basement but has been able to take these all the way upstairs to our dining room without problem. The sound is amazing and super easy controls. They fit very comfortable no matter the size of your ear. My only complaint is he can't hear me once they are on ;-P
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I've had it for a while and I love it so much. I now go around sonicing everything in sight. It makes two sounds. The regular screwdriver sound that is on the show and a buzzing with a slight chirp. When the screwdriver is extended it is about the same size as the Eleventh Doctor's sonic when it is not extended. It has two nibs: A regular pen nib and a UV light nib. I super glued my pen nib in because it kept falling out. That was the only problem I had with the screwdriver and I would definitely suggest this to every Whovian I meet.
B005EGXTEE|4.0|Enjoyed the book and kept me on the edge of my seat wondering where the relationship with Katniss and Peeter was going.  I do think that Tomorrow When The War Began series are better book for teens.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|Entertaining. Worth the time. Not much in the way of suspense nor much of a twist but a really good story.
B007R3AZNK|5.0|I had never heard of Joe Bonamassa until I saw him on our local PBS station during their periodic fund-raising week. Both my husband and I fell immediately for his unbelievable skill and musicianship on both acoustic and electric guitar, his raw emotion in every word of every lyric, and his passion for rock and blues. A few days later, we saw that he was bringing his Driving Towards the Daylight Tour to Detroit and bought tickets. Best concert I've been to in years. Two hours of magic over in the blink of an eye. I loved every song, from the his quiet acoustic numbers to his full out electric rock and blues songs. Especially loved \\"Who's Been Talking\\", and was entranced by his encore with \\"Sloe Gin.\\" He brought out Detroit's own Jim McGarty, fantastic rock guitarist who has played with Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels and featured him on some songs. Wow. I was worried that the album wouldn't hold up to my expectations from the concert, but I was so wrong. You can feel the passion in every note and every guitar lick. Outstanding in every way. So then I bought his acoustic live album, \\"Acoustic Evening at the Vienna Opera House.\\" Very different, but just as good. I recommend both.

B0070DOHQS|5.0|I haven't tried it outside my home network yet, but this application works very well to quickly access my other computers without having to move my lazy self to the other room!<br />EDIT: just tried the free viewer app from the website, and agree with the earlier reviewer, this is a very useful addition.<br />EDIT2: I am less thrilled with the off site performance. We use DSL both at home and at office, and accessing my home desktop from the office is quite clunky. I have used logmein, and it is much faster. This might just be a slow DSL line.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|The Hobbit : An Unexpected Journey was ok.  It tied in with the Lord Of The Rings trilogy.  But the dwarfs, I don't know, it seemed more like a comedy in some of the scenes with them.  The Ork leader was pretty cool.  And the trolls, they were more like the 3 stooges of the middle earth.  On a good note, it left it wide open for the sequel.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I heard about this book from a post by Martin Lewis on Facebook. I figured if he was compelled to tell all his followers how gripping the book was and how much he enjoyed it then it was worth a go for the very little it cost.<br />Some have complained about the language in this book, and yes it starts out with two F words on the first page. I don't agree at all that this is lazy writing. This is a NASA astronaut in a dire situation. I think it wouldn't ring true if he had just said written in his journal \\"oh dear, never mind\\".<br />It also is typical of his personality, that we discover more and more of as we go through each day and experience with him. He had me laughing out loud with some of his comments. He's a great guy.<br />I've also read complaints about the technical content. This is an astronaut, stranded on Mars. It's going to be technical in places. It just makes your realise how intelligent this guy is and how adaptable. I'm a complete maths hater and don't have a technical or engineering bone in my body yet it didn't bore me. I was gripped throughout. I can't say too much more without spoiling the story. I envy anyone who hasn't read this yet as you're in for a treat.
B00A0A6F7C|3.0|Like so many, I first saw Susan on the BGT You Tube vids and loved her.  This is the first of her CDs I bought and I was sadly disappointed.  I think the initial charm to her was how we could all relate to her (being an everage looking genuine lady next door person not all made up & perfect) and how surprised we were with the talent that came from such an unlikely package.  Unfortunately that does not come through on a CD.  I thought several of the songs (or perhaps the arrangements of the songs) were not well suited to her voice and listening to Donny Osmond is akin to having knitting needles shoved into my ears.  Please do not get me wrong, Susan is talented, but this just was not as good as I hoped it would be as I think the major issue is the songs were not well chosen for her abilities.  I am sure I will get blasted for this review, but it really left me flat, which CDs from Paul Potts, Jonathan & Charlotte and so on, for example, did not.  I've listened to it a couple times and will be listing it on ebay.  I wanted to love this CD, I really did, but it was disappointing.
034554398X|3.0|I can't argue that GRRM is a genius at creating a story--from what appears to be endless angles. And the first three books of this series were captivating. But I won't be buying any more of the books, and I really caution others to carefully consider getting into the books of this series at all. Although GRRM knows how to spin a yarn, he doesn't know how to bring closure to it. These books and the tales of their characters go on and on and on, many with one bad thing after another happening to the most loved characters.<br />But wait, just when you think a character has finally escaped the wringer of their storyline via death, he/she often is reanimated somewhere, somehow--that is all except our beloved Ned of Winterfell, may he rest in peace.<br />Speaking for myself, as I said, I'm done with the books. I'll wait for HBO to fill me in (love the way Tyrion is being played!). And besides, I only have to wait a year for the next installment...not six as the readers had to wait for the last book in the series--that was supposed to be the last of the series, but as I said, GRRM seems to have resolution issues.

B00AYQNOLW|5.0|Ron Fricke is a genius. This film was made in 5 years and filmed in many countries. It shows the human condition and how we are all connected without being preachy... or talking. The music is amazing. It feels like a mediation.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|My wife and I were given seasons 1 and 2 as gifts, so naturally we had to see season 3.  We watched a new episode each night, and were only disappointed that we came to the end.  Bring on season 4.
B001XV3LSS|5.0|Acting was fine, as good as could be with the script, but I think the best part of the film is simply the concept and the action that goes into the discovery and consequences of what happens along the way (can't say more without spoiling it!). Watch it!!! Family friendly, but still a great movie even among adults.

0142437611|4.0|The novel Seize the Day by Saul Bellow is a story about a sad, regretful man of his 40s named Tommy Wilhelm. The story consists of the hindsight of memories long past, viewed in a deep psychological level. The lesson seems to be focused around isolation and discontentment and being unable to repair the circumstances of one's life. The thing I love about Bellow's novels are his approach to the mind and his view of the human psyche. I also like how Bellow is not afraid to delve into topic of life's many mistakes that most people refuse to look at or acknowledge. There is nothing I can really think of that I did not find enjoyable with this book. Therefore, I recommend this to any who, like me, find the inner workings of the mind fascinating. As Bello's style is very distinct and prominent throughout all of his works, I would also advise his other books.

B000JMKRKC|5.0|As I read I had to keep reminding myself \\"this is not a George Eliot novel,\\" for it seemed so, and that is high praise! The pace is good, but also reminiscent of George Eliot, tho thankfully not as long. Ms. Setterfield weaves a marvelous tale.  I am looking forward to her next book due out in Nov.

B000VDUWMC|4.0|The book is great!<br />But cannot give 5 stars because Kindle edition is missing all figures. And they are important to understand some parts of the book.<br /><br />O livro é ótimo!<br />Só não dou 5 estrelas porque a versão Kindle que comprei não tem as figuras. E elas são importantes em algumas partes do livro para facilitar o entendimento.
1400069289|2.0|The book has some useful information about research involving habits and willpower (in this point, \\"The Willpower Instinct\\", from Kelly McGonigal, is much better), but, beyond the (a bit suspicious) theory of habit structure (\\"cue, routine, reward\\"), the rest of the book is not much more then a simplistic collection of anecdotes. The reading is light and could be nicer if it wasn't the tone too naive: were your parents drug addicts? Were you born in a poor suburb full of social problems? Do not lose your hope. All you need is a job at Starbucks and they will give you what your family and school did not... self-discipline! (but profits remain with them) To be perfectly honest, this book might deserve 3 stars. But as it is clearly overrated in the Amazon, I'll give only 2.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I guess I'm from the older generation as I'm not into this kink of<br />&#34;romance&#34;.  I don't like the path this book takes!!
1583334386|5.0|A serious book, in which the author has managed to be scientifically rigorous and at the same time, not be boring or hermetic. A book that does not neglect the intelligence of the reader, but want to turn him into a pragmatic scientist of his own willpower. I wanted to read more books just like this, with this style: science help. A reading that is worth. A lot.

B00AAQRNQ8|3.0|My G5 died recently and I went on an epic mouse hunt involving, in the end, 9 different mice of which this was one. In a wasteland of bad things there's a lot of good here, but ultimately it was not satisfactory for me.<br /><br />First, some facts about me: I used this mouse for gaming, shopping (via the GIMP) and web browsing. I did not try any add-on/driver software because I run Linux where these things just never work, so my review does not comment on the quality and or behavior of any such software that may exist.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Large. A lot of mice are just too tiny, this one wide enough to be comfortable and long enough and well-shaped to fit the rest of my hand.<br /><br />Comfortable. No awkward angles or missing rests, just the way I like my mice.<br /><br />Good scroll-wheel action. While not as stiff as I like and without an audible click (which I also prefer) the scroll wheel does have a firm, noticeable action when it ticks over.<br /><br />Adjustable weight. The out of the box weight was a little light, but I was able to adjust it to within tolerances. I like a medium-weight mouse and it can be an issue for me if weight is non-adjustable and the mouse is too light.<br /><br />Extra middle finger button. I like the placement of this button, very handy.<br /><br />DPI. Adjustable and with good default values.<br /><br />Price<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Extra middle finger button means that the scroll wheel is not in a familiar place. I'm confident I could adjust to this.<br /><br />Thumb button placement. This mouse has three buttons along the left-hand side where a right handed grip would place the thumb. I use a sort of a claw grip verging in to a palm grip depending on usage scenario and this places my thumb directly over the three buttons, which incidentally correspond to alt, ctrl and shift. Although I liked this concept the buttons are placed in a dreadful location such that normal gripping results in depressing them accidentally. In addition the action on these buttons is too light; if they were very stiff then I could perhaps deal with them, but they depress so easily that I am constantly hitting modifier keys (a serious problem in a realtime FPS or RTS!)<br /><br />Lack of thumb button. The keyboard buttons were cool, if misplaced, but the fact that I didn't have a regular mouse thumb button as I had on my G5 was an inconvenience. I could bind this button on the G5 to various effects, but rebinding modifier keys is really not something I want to do.<br /><br />For some uses, or for users with a different grip style, this mouse would probably be fine, but for mine it's unacceptable. Had the thumb buttons been lifted higher such that my thumb grip would not depress them when moving the mouse then I would probably have settled on this mouse as my G5 replacement. For the price this is a *remarkably good* mouse with excellent behavior and suitable for all of my purposes, with the major caveat being the intrusive thumb buttons. I had considered just unmapping them and ignoring them, but they click so easily that it was not a very good option. Even when not doing anything the constant clicking would be annoying.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|I watched this out of curiosity, seeing one of the top anime to watch from numerous sites. I was really susceptible about the art style but i am a man of my drama so i went ahead and bought it. Boy o boy was i not disappointing this is now one of my favorite animes previous was Kamisama no memo. DO NOT hesitate to buy this you will not regret. I do not write reviews for my items but this is my second or third time meaning i am taking the time to actually state how well this movie is. The ending will literally rip you're heart out of your chest! Why are you still reading this BUY IT!!!!
B009NY43NY|1.0|WARNING SOME SPOILERS: What was the point in Sookie's journey through 13 books if she just winds up where she started? There's an emotional disconnect with Sookie in the last few books and especially this one that is disconcerting. It makes me think that the title \\"Dead Ever After,\\" as opposed to \\"Happily Ever After,\\" means that Sookie's dead inside. It certainly feels that way. I would've been happy if Sookie ended up alone but strong and comfortable with who she is. Through the course of this series Sookie learns that her telepathy, once her \\"disability\\" that made her a social outcast, is valuable to the vampires and supes and she learns to use it to her advantage. However, Sookie goes back to questioning it in this book and wonders if Mr. C can take it away. Why doesn't she use her gift for the greater good? And what was the point in Niall saying she had an \\"essential spark\\" and would do something special with her life when she chooses an ordinary one in the end? I understand the author's love of small town life and wanting to keep Sookie rooted in Bon Temps. But she could've stayed in Gran's house and been a consultant for the FBI or law enforcement using her special abilities to help people and doing something more with her life than just waiting tables at Merlotte's. Regarding Sookie's choice in suitors, her apathy regarding the breakup with one was hard to read and seemed almost cruel because of the length of the relationship and the intensity of it over the course of the books. The author replacing this suitor with another so quickly didn't resonate emotionally for me and I didn't see a romantic relationship forming until it happened. Also, Sookie's sudden desire to have children could've come to fruition with the infertile suitor and a sperm donor, so her HEA choice seemed forced to me. This series stopped being a fun read after Book 8. But most of all I'm saddened by where Sookie decides to go with her life at the end. Which is nowhere.

193700788X|1.0|I loved this series until this book. This is the most disappointing book I have ever read. Aside from the fact the heroine doesn't end up with anyone she is passionately in love with.....you can tell the author gave up, there is no heart in the writing. It is written as if by someone who is bored and intentionally trying to turn the fans off from it. Don't waste your money or time!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really love this game. Its a great game to play. Different countries but I think they should do more U.S. States. That would be awesome. 5 stars for this game
B0084AZXKK|5.0|The tale never ages!  Great seafaring, swashbuckling, treasure hunting fun.  And the Kindle format makes it so convenient to carry around with other classics.  Stevenson's prose is also a delight to read in and of itself.

B003CI90MQ|5.0|I have this book loaded on my phone and when I am out wanting to take a great picture, I open it up first and check out what he has to say about photographing the specific scene.  Then I go shoot!<br /><br />When reading the book, my head was spinning from all the ideas he shared, but when I went out to take some photos, I couldn't remember all of the specifics he recommended.  Having it on my phone is the perfect solution, I open it, find the chapter about the subject I am shooting, and start shooting with the specifics he recommends.<br /><br />I already see a dramatic improvement in the photos I take.  A great starter and reference book!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I thought this game was really cool and fun because u get to pretty much create your own restaurant and cook the food decorate the restaurant.
B000062XE1|3.0|I am not giving this 3 stars based on the works, or the actors and actresses, which are superb. The 3 stars are based solely on the video needing to be updated, it needs to be remastered, it is dingy and takes much away from the stories and visual enjoyment.  If you can find a newer version with better quality picture, don't walk, run... to buy it. This version takes away from the great stories the visuals and detracts from the brilliant actors.
0393345084|3.0|My impressions about this book was changing during the reading.<br />First 100 pages, I was thinking that this is one of the popular fiction about 2008 crisis and there's nothing new since [[ASIN:0393337804 The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008]].<br />Second, I was thinking that Krugman is unsatisfied envious person, because of total criticism all economists around him.<br />Third, Krugman's ideas of total uncontrollable budget spending seemed too naive for me.<br /><br />But, I can surely say - This Book has changed my mind when I finished it.<br /><br />What interesting spots could I notice?<br />* The book made my economic views more broad-minded (despite I've read a lot about crisises)<br />* The book tells about Keynesianism role in economic science and crisis solving<br />* Krugman proofs that expansive budget policy and money printing is essential in crisis/depression environment and austerity is the devil!<br />* Krugman tells us how it will be possible to reduce US debt later<br />* Why QE-1-2-3 doesnt convert to  inflation

B003Y3BMFW|5.0|If you're a fan of Soundgarden you must have this CD/DVD combo.  The song Black Rain is so good it's almost worth it just for this song.  A few good tracks that are live and a great collection of music videos.  Even a pretty cool little booklet of info that you'll find interesting if you're a fan of Soundgarden.  For the price you really can't beat this collection.
B0098460O4|5.0|Even though I live in the USA, I follow BGT religiously (and I don't bother with the US version). I was in awe of the amazing talent of Jonathan and Charlotte as they revealed their talent to Britain and the world. I rushed to purchase this, their debut album, which came with a free MP3 delivered to my Kindle Fire. What a great deal!<br /><br />The album contains The Prayer, from the audition and final, and Caruso, from the semi-finals. The rest of the songs are mainly pop songs translated into Italian. This can be a little confusing at first...is that Elton John's, \\"Your Song\\"??<br /><br />Jonathan's voice is even better than you heard him before. Charlotte is a revelation; her voice has come a long way. I expect Jonathan to become a star in the opera world and Charlotte to be a star in musical theater - I kept wanting her to do Phantom of the Opera. And I would love them to come back to together every year or two to record another album.<br /><br />This CD is not perfect, I am sorry to say. The arrangements are often so over-the-top that I began laughing. The J&C version of Muse's \\"Unintended\\" probably fared best because the music is so understated. I still give the CD 5 stars because even awful arrangements can't keep J&C's talent down.
B003B96AOW|4.0|This is a very nice action figure, it does not have alot of articulation but it is a Marvel Select. The sculpt is excellent the accessories are awesome ant the paint job is great. So people will wonder why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 since I love this figure so much. After I opened the packaging i realized that the base is missing a piece, i have the ground with all the spent bullet casings but the wall with all the bullet holes was not in the box. This had to happen long before it showed up on amazon because the box was sealed, this may not be a big deal to some people but it was really disappointing to me.

0142421715|4.0|This review contains mild spoilers for both Matched and Crossed. I wrote it prior to reading Reached, which I subsequently did read. It is important to read the books in order.<br /><br />The Matched series is part of the slew of dystopian Young Adult novels. While it doesn't have the wide-spanned biting satire of The Hunger Games (and maybe not quite as much jeopardy), the books are very compelling in their own way. Ally Condie writes beautifully. Her prose has some very poetic elements. Poetry (as well as other written expression) is highly valued in the Matched universe. No surprise there. In a Society where there are only 100 sanctioned items in any category of the arts, off-list art is a taste of freedom and a highly-charged symbol.<br /><br />In Matched, Cassia is somehow given a glimpse of a boy (Ky) she vaguely knows before her Society-approved match (Xander) comes up on the data card. Her curiosity is piqued, and her life is changed forever. She pursues a relationship with Ky and becomes more and more aware of the splintering cracks in the seemingly perfect Society. She discovers that even her parents and grandfather quietly, gently buck the system. She learns how to write, a skill that enables her to express herself without the ever-watchful Society knowing about it.<br /><br />Xander is a perfect boy and has been her friend all of her life. He will have a position of high esteem, and his chances of success (based on Society's data) are astronomical. Ky, on the other hand, is an Aberration, and it does not take long for him to lose even his menial job. Both boys love her, and she loves both of them.<br /><br />At the end of Matched, Cassia goes off looking for Ky, who has been sent to the front to be a Decoy for The Enemy. Crossed is her odyssey, her dual search for Ky and The Rising. Her quest tests both her physical and mental endurance. Crossed is also a journey for Ky. The chapters alternate between Cassia's and Ky's points of view. Ky's difficult lifehas taught him to \\"not go gentle\\" as Dylan Thomas wrote in the most important taboo poem quoted in the books.<br /><br />In Crossed, we learn a little more about The Society's machinations and ruthlessness. New characters are introduced. As the second of three books, Crossed is transitional, but there is a lot of soul searching and self-discovery. Both Cassia and Ky must decide whether love is more important than revolution. (Xander seems to have figured things out some time ago.) In the end, we will have to read Reached to see how things turn out.<br /><br />These books are not for readers seeking high adventure. Even the horrors of war and trials of rough terrain didn't evoke any visceral reactions from me. There is a slow and thoughtful pace to these books. Perhaps more brutal descriptions of war and wilderness would be too jarring. (Not sure.)<br /><br />If I like characters and a story, I don't want the story to end. I love long, drawn-out tales, as long as they are mostly substance and little filler. When the narrative is woven over several books, the story will necessarily be molded by the dramatic structure. Matched was fascinating due to the world-building and character introductions. Reached should answer all of the questions and resolve the plots. Crossed does not have any of these advantages, but it is a lovely read where we gain a lot of insight into two of the three major characters.<br /><br />Just remember, this series in NOT for thrill-seekers.

B00AMBK0X4|2.0|This is a great movie, but if you can't watch it on Android, whats the point?<br /><br />Again, the movie itself is excellent.  The instant video service does not support the device I want to watch it on, so my experience with this product is poor.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Okay, so I'm attracted to certain New Thought concepts. But I am adverse to self-delusion and wedded to the scientific method.  I loved this book, because it maps out scientific experiments to test what some people call the Law of Attraction.  I am still doing some of the experiments but have had some cool results.  Here is what I find truly strange--I bought this book on Kindle for $2.  $2?  Really?  I can't imagine why it is so inexpensive.  This is an interesting, engaging read, humorous, professionally edited, 200 pages, and was published this year (2013).  The author acknowledges the arguments of skeptics, gives her views judiciously, and does not insult your intelligence.  Thank you, Pat Grout.  Thank you, Kindle. One of the absolutely best books on this subject I've come across.  Highly recommended.

0385342071|2.0|I am very  fun  of  Sophie Kinsella Shopaholic  series, \\"Can you  keep  a secret\\" , \\"Undomestic  Goddess\\", etc. Like  her easy  style  , humour  and  the fact  that  you  can link  it  to yourself and  laugh  even if something really  exaggerated.  But this  book was  real disappointment: (1)  looks like  Author just delivers her annual Financial  Plan for  new  book launch to  have  healthy  family  P&L-  no criminal  here  of  course (2)  no  fun, very  predictable, the story more than just  simple ,  heroes behaviour -  far-fetched (3)  boring  starting page #10<br /><br />Maybe it makes sense to wait until you have really  good  insight for  new book... Still love Shopaholic, looking  forward  to  meet  her again and ready  to wait.... :)

193700788X|1.0|Although the last 3 books were weak and felt like filler rather than actual stand alone books, fans of the series still held hope for a satisfying conclusion. But it was not to be. The assassination of Eric's character that started in Death in the Family (or thereabouts) continues to an extreme in the final instalment and for his pains, the character that has captivated most readers is sold into slavery. That of course means that the core relationship throughout the series (Eric & Sookie) do not the happy ending that many were still hoping for. It is hard to reconcile the playful & intriguing relationship they had in the early part of the series with the nastiness that the final book delivers.<br /><br />It is sad that the series concludes on such a low note but still, I am happy to have read the early books in the series for the great characters they introduced at least as they were in those first books before they became the travesty they are in Dead Ever After.

B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book clarifies so much about me and so many members of my family. Growing up, I had teachers and extended family who believed I needed to be &#34;fixed&#34; because I was so quiet.  Even friends would give me directions on how to be more outgoing.  They would say, &#34;Just go to the party and be yourself, its easy!&#34;  Unfortunately, &#34;myself&#34; would just want to go home and curl up with a good book or climb a tall tree and look peacefully down on the world.  I learned to navigate the world of extroverts and hold my own at parties, social events, and in the workplace, but it definitely wasn't by being myself.<br />I loved this book not only because it explains the introvert that I am, but also because it celebrates the need for different kinds of personalities.

The author has done a marvelous job of humanizing one of the most complex business personalities of the last 30 years - Steve Jobs.  Jobs was impossible, passionate, rude, crude, lacked empathy, distant, but he was also brilliant and envisioned things 10 years down the line.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and I would recommend it to anyone.  Steve Jobs was a fascinating individual, and this books puts him and his Apple vision in perspective.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|A high quality, very comfortable full size mouse. The feature that was appealing for my application (I'm using the mouse for AutoCAD and Rhino 3D) was the programmable buttons. The ability to program a macro, or individual letters into the buttons is a very useful feature. My other mice have been \\"programmable\\", but only a few commands that were pre-chosen by the manufacturer. The Anker mouse buttons are truly programmable. All the buttons have a consistent feel and operating pressure, and have a satisfying quality \\"click\\". The downloadable setup software is easy to use, and has high cool factor, as does the mouse design.<br /><br />I'm taking a wild swing here, but the high quality of this Anker High Precision Gaming Mouse, coupled with the reasonable price, makes me think that Anker has chosen to give their customers a quality Chinese product without the attendant huge markups that the other manufacturers are charging. It is obvious that China is able to deliver high quality when asked to do so, but it is clear that most importers have bumped their retail prices so high that their products could be made domestically.<br /><br />Thanks to Anker for this quality product.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00AAQRNQ8 Anker High Precision Laser Gaming Mouse with 8000 DPI, 9 Programmable Buttons, Weight Tuning Cartridge, Omron Micro Switches for PC]]
B0060AY6FO|4.0|\\"Death Comes to Pemberley\\" is the latest of P.D.James' mysteries and starts about six years after the end of Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\"  Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth are now married and have two little boys and live at Darcy's beautiful estate, Pemberley, along with his sister, Georgiana, who has yet to marry.  The year is 1803.  Elizabeth's sister, Lydia, is married to Wickham, and they are unwelcome at Pemberley.  Sister Jane and her husband, Bingley, live nearby and Mr. Bennet visits and enjoys Darcy's library.  Mrs. Bennet is too much of a splutter and too resentful to visit Elizabeth and has yet to find a husband for the last of her daughters, Kitty.  Lydia had disgraced the family when she ran off and eloped with Mr. Wickham.<br /><br />The mystery surrounds a murder that takes place in the woodlands at Pemberley.  A man is murdered after stepping out of a coach while riding through the woods and only one other person is there and confesses that he killed the man and that it is his fault.  This happens the day before the Darcys are to have their annual autumn ball, Lady Anne's ball, named for Darcy's mother. Preparations are well under way when a coach comes flying up to Pemberley and out tumbles an hysterical Lydia screeching that her husband is dead. The mystery begins and continues to the end with the trial.<br /><br />If there is any part that reminded me of Jane Austen's writing, it was right at the beginning of the book, but for the rest of it the writing was P.D. James.  She greatly admires Austen and at the age of 91 took on the job of an Austen mystery and I very much admire her for that.  Some of the other Jane Austen books and mysteries I've read were not as good as this one.  I'm not going to fault James for not writing like Jane Austen because she isn't Jane Austen, but has her own style that make a mystery her own.  This one, however, was not nearly as complicated and multilayered as most of her other books are with numerous characters and subplots that take a lot of pages to resolve.<br /><br />I did enjoy visiting with Elizabeth and Darcy, Jane and Bingley and even Lydia and Wickham.  A lot of family secrets are revealed and one is rather scandalous, especially for those days.  I thought it was a fun read and it made me crave Jane Austen and also Dalgliesh again.<br /><br />Recommended if you like Austen and/or P.D. James.

B008FRFN7A|1.0|I downloaded the free version of this app to my Kindle Fire on 5/6/13.  My intent was to use it with my new HP Photosmart 7520 wireless printer which has ePrint capability. When I contacted HP for technical support, however, I was informed by the Rep that HP no longer supports this android app.  Therefore, I deleted it from my KF. Undaunted, HP offered an alternative solution to my KF print dilemma and I'm happy to report that the process was quick, simple and painless.  HP simply assigned an email address to my ePrint printer.  To print something from my KF, all I have to do is use my KF email account to email directly to my printer, Word and Excel documents created using QuickOffice Pro.  Among other things, I can also email photos and screen shots.  That's the beauty of ePrint.  My printer not only prints the cover email, but also the unopened attachments!  Now, this is COOL technology!

193700788X|1.0|*SPOILERS* Ever since the ending of this book was leaked, we've heard the masses roaring in outrage, and I'm here to tell you it really was THAT bad. Forget up developing characters for an entire series, making readers fall in love with Eric or root for Bill - or Quinn even, and then throwing every story arc out the window by having SAM just randomly win Sookie's heart. Forget about the title of EVERY book in this series that has 'Dead' in the title - did CH forget that she's been leading us on from book one? All of that aside, I only have one thing to say that will forever prove this book is NOT worth your money: Sookie describes sex with Sam as seals slapping together. So, yeah. Wicked gross image and just the epitome of awful considering ERIC used to sex her right. I'd recommend buying TWILIGHT instead, as vampires sparkling in the sun is somehow more believable than this rot. Do not get suckered into this series that will make you fall for characters and then completely destroy them, and you in the process.

0425252868|5.0|If you enjoy WWII historical stories like Erik Larson's Into the Garden of Beasts or Laura Hillenbrand's Unbroken this is your next book to read. What I Iove about this story is that the majority of the insight is from the vantage point of a German WWII ace and the conflict he and is country men often wrestled with. They were NOT loyal to Hitler, G&ouml;ring or the SS party cause, rather they were loyal to each other and to honor. Read this fascinating tale about how a German Fighter Pilot and an American Bomber Pilot ultimately become as close as brothers.<br /><br />The inside look of Germany, like Larson's work, during the WW II is fascinating. I particularly enjoyed learning about the Dessert War as well.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy reading this book as much as I did.<br /><br />Digital Leader: 5 Simple Keys to Success and Influence
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Wow!!  I couldn't put it down. You never know what's happening next or who will die or live. Can't wait for the next book. This is an epic saga.
0062059963|3.0|Ok... I've taken a few days to think and I discussed with the lovely Kassiah and have come to the conclusion that I'm torn on what to rate this book.<br /><br />The problem I'm having here is that for whatever reason I can't look away. I hated the characters, and I hated the very slim and almost non-existent plot of this book... yet I read it in a day and I didn't want to put it down.<br /><br />What the heck is a girl supposed to do with that?<br /><br />So in The Elite, we are still hanging out with Prince Maxon - America has made the cut and is in the final six. Maxon is doing all he can to convince America that she's who he wants... all while dating 5 other girls.<br /><br />I mean, you've all seen The Bachelor and any other of those irritating dating shows right? That's this. In book form and the dude is a prince.<br /><br />Let's start with the plot. I mean, what there is of it. I swear 80% of this book is spent going back in forth in America's mind on whether she can handle being a princess and whether she loves Maxon or whether she loves Aspen.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure at around 30% I wanted to choke her out. The girl couldn't make a decision to save her own damn life, which I get sort of... she's a teenager trying to make an adult decision. I mean there she was at the end of The Selection saying she needed to do this for her and choose for herself... THEN MAKE A GOD DAMN DECISION. She would see Aspen and she'd be all \\"ohhhhh I still love you.\\" and then she'd see Maxon and be telling him she wanted to be there and not to give up on her she just needs time.<br /><br />You've had ALL of book 2 now... make your damn decision already. And to be perfectly honest, at this point in the game, if you're still playing I just don't think you should even be considering Aspen. He almost seems like the ideal back-up plan for her because if she doesn't win she can always fall back on him. I don't like that she expects him to wait in the wings while she does all the things with Maxon and then gets jealous when Aspen is talking with another girl. You can't have everything America.<br /><br />So yeah. I was irritated with her.<br /><br />But I was also irritated with Maxon. Yeah I know... hold on for this.<br /><br />The dude has spent all this time trying to convince America that she's the one for him and when he finally does, suddenly he becomes distant.<br /><br />WHUT?? And the excuses ... I just wasn't buying it. I mean I get that this is a competition, but honestly, I might have bought this reaction earlier in book 1 where he was meant to get to know all the girls, but at this point he has the field narrowed to 6 and he's still kind of playing them all??? THAT DOES NOT MAKE A SWOONY BOY!!<br /><br />I get it. I truly do. I know that he wasn't feeling secure in America's feelings for him, but instead of giving her MORE reason to question them, maybe ... I don't know... try allaying them instead of adding fuel to the fire.<br /><br />yes yes yes... I know that wouldn't have made a book 3 possible right?<br /><br />Okay... aside from the 80% of America being all wishy-washy, the other time is spent on the girls doing tasks to show they could succeed at being the princess and hiding in secret rooms from the rebels who seem to be searching the castle for something and leaving cryptic messages all over the walls after an attack.<br /><br />You guys... I'm making it sound like I didn't like this and that's not true. It's really not. I'm seriously torn here, because like I said, I couldn't look away, and at one point told a friend that I hated every single character in this book yet I kept going. I'm invested. I want to see if America finally gets her head out of her ass and decides which boy she loves more and I want to know what those damn rebels want.<br /><br />I think what Cass did well here was show that even in the throes of competition women don't have to go for the throat. America was able to develop some wonderful friendshipsdespite the competition and we also get to see bits and pieces of her relationship with her father, which I think were really well done. His love and support for her even if she isn't chosen really shows the true bond of family and it's definitely something rare in YA books. I mean in all honesty, America is only seventeen and that's a point in your life when you need that support.<br /><br />Cass even gives us a bit more information on the creation of Ilea and the development of the castes. I'm not sure it was developed enough, but it was there, and I'm not even sure I like how it was done... i.e. reading through the former rulers personal diary. But it was enlightening for sure.<br /><br />So there... I'm not sure what to tell you here. I was frustrated with the true lack of a plot and any movement forward with the story. The story here felt very static and there was only one elimination, which wasn't even really a true elimination. I think by this point we should have the field narrowed down a bit more but ... that's just me. It will be interesting to see how Cass wraps up this series. I imagine the final book will be filled with everything seeing as how this book wasn't filled with much of anything. AND YES. I'll be reading book three even if I end up hating everyone in it.<br /><br />If you're a fan of The Bachelor or any of those other drama filled reality shows, you might just love this series. Though keep in mind, book 1 has a bit more action and drama than this one does. Meanwhile, I'll be waiting around for book 3 like everyone else and shaking my fist at Cass because... I can't quit your series. Even if I hate everyone in it.despite the competition and we also get to see bits and pieces of her relationship with her father, which I think were really well done.

B002VPE1WK|2.0|I take giving an item 2 out of 5 stars pretty seriously. I will offer this disclaimer - the bag in and of itself is not horrible. But read the product description carefully, particularly the dimensions of the bag. My first impression when opening the box: boy is this thing small! I was very disappointed in what I could fit inside the bag; I also had concerns about the lack of padding between the camera and other equipment, or with the front or back of the bag. I sat with the bag and tried arranging my equipment (Nikon DSLR 3100 with an 18-55mm, 70-300mm, and a 35mm portrait lens, plus a remote trigger, several lens caps, filters, cleaners, memory cards/USB memory sticks, a backup battery, etc.) in various ways, but just never felt satisfied that my equipment was secured and protected. Prior to making the purchase I took special care and read other reviews to see if my Apple 13&#34; Macbook would fit inside the bag; while the computer can fit inside the outside compartment, it barely does so. In order to fit a 13&#34; computer into this bag it has to go in completely &#34;naked&#34; (not even a small slip on neoprene cover), and if you have anything inside the bag the pressure makes it so you can hardly close the zipper. The computer is left completely unprotected. The straps were also short and oddly placed for an adult male - I could not close the mid-chest strap, not to mention the &#34;waist level&#34; belt. I am an adult male who is over 6 feet tall, and this bag is just too small for me to carry both from a purely aesthetic standpoint (it looks like a child's book-bag), but also from a practical standpoint (straps don't fit (even fully extended), it won't stay on my shoulder, it can hardly carry a typical intermediate level users gear, etc.). While I would recommend the bag for someone looking for a very low priced small bag for stowing gear, I would not recommend this bag to my peers (adult males or larger persons or people with more than a single SLR body and lens). I purchased this bag to use on an upcoming trip, in order to consolidate several smaller camera bags I've used. Not only did I not take this bag on the trip, I ended up processing a return and sending it back to Amazon. Buyer beware...lens).

0385349831|5.0|Inspired by the Apocryphal Gospels, the narrator transcribes a manuscript written in 1099 by a man on the eve of the invasion of Jerusalem by the crusaders who have surrounded the city's gates.  Inhabitants of the city have drawn together to hear the words of a Greek man known as the Copt.  In a question and answer session, the Copt addresses their fears with wisdom, minus any interruptions from the crowd.  The questions range from beauty, love, wisdom, sex, elegance, the future, loyalty, etc.  In this unique format, an incredibly relevant sampling of human fears and hopes are addressed by the frightened crowd.<br /><br />The broad range of questions, many of which seem unlikely on the eve of potential destruction, are followed by sage advice from the Copt.  The reader is bound to happen upon one or more questions that have current relevance in their lives.  In addition, the reader is sure to find unreferenced quotes from many diverse sources.  There are no story elements in this work - just a smidgeon of backstory followed by dialogue.  To me, it is more a collection of wisdom presented in a unique, didactic format that doesn't really feel sententious.<br /><br />The book's unique format is what initially attracted me to its pages.  It is a bold form of storytelling, at times inspirational and at times emboldening.  For me, it resonated and I recommend it as a quick read.

0345441184|5.0|If you are a fan of Arthurian lore, this is a story told from several women's perspectives of what happened during the time of Arthur. It is magical from the beginning to the end. Timeless!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I have listed to the album multiple times now.  It has a very bluesy, R&B sound that is soulful at times and rebellious at others.
0553386794|5.0|I read the book after watching the first season and it plays along real well with the series which most books don't. Wonderful writing and storytelling style. Won't be able to put it down.
B005CRQ4GU|2.0|All the other books were good, but the third wheel could've been a lot better. I finished it in 25 minutes.
B002UNMW7O|4.0|Lots of people complained about this one, yes it's not as GREAT as the original but I still enjoyed it. I loved seeing them together again. Their chemistry and their new adventures take me on a ride, I had fun with it. I can't go wrong with them.
B00BUADSMQ|2.0|Unfortunately I will have to agree with many of the bad reviews here. I left the theater feeling it was a movie to watch when you are skipping channels late at  night. Cliché and predictible story with lack of excitement. Definitely the weakest of all 5 movies.  I will buy it just to keep my collection complete but very disappointed. Would not recommend it.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|One of the best shows on TV NOW. No it's not just about Zombies people! It's about survival, how far would you go to protect those you love, being tested in a world that changes from one day to the next, who do you trust, etc... It's far more than any Zombie movie, its about the struggle of human nature to survive and what that does to a person. Great cast, crew, and show- amazing!
044654759X|4.0|I bought this for my mother as she collects Nicholas Sparks books but had to read it for myself...... classic Sparks style
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Loved this season and show. And it continues to get better and better. Don't miss it, cast, crew, locations, you name it. VERY well done!
B000001F45|5.0|According to my friend he absolutely loves this CD. I have not listened to it my self but I am happy with the delivery and condition of the product upon arrival. So was my friend.
1452654425|4.0|This is another CD I bought to listen in my car to help me learn to cope and set boundaries for my unhealthy parents. As I listened to the many different cases a lot of them reminded them of me and episodes I would have with my family. This will teach you how you can set limits and learn to say no to them and yes to yourself freeing yourself from an unhealthy cycle in your family life.
B0091REZMW|4.0|yes this is only a free intro but it's not bad....intricate game with lots to explore and more complex than average hidden object game
B00192IV0O|3.0|This music genre isn't really to my taste, but I love &#34;I Got A Feeling.&#34; There were a couple of other cuts I liked well enough, but overall it wasn't for me. Gave it to my grandson; it was much more to his taste.
B005K17RU0|1.0|I have had this app for a long time...was so easy to use.....you could have at least let each person WANT the update.  app went from 5 star to crap!  and leaves me looking for another app:-(
B00013RC66|5.0|Oh how I love this movie! It defies expropriation! I was happy, no... delighted to see it for sale and at a reasonable price too. It came quick, and in perfect condition too. Thanks guys, for having it for sale.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|excellent series my book club ruled against it and then decided to read it...glad we did it isn't as bad as folk say it is many lessons to learn
B00019074O|5.0|Fully old show!

B00005O3VC|5.0|Perfect! I am incredibly glad to get this.
B005DI66N4|5.0|I read this book to my husband while on a 2 day driving trip....we loved it!  All pit stops were shortened because we couldn't wait to get back into the car to read more.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|I've gone though 3 dongles made by other companies before I bought this one. Two of the other 3 were the same brand and had slower transfer times. The first one died and then the warranty replacement died. Even though I was still underwarranty, I didn't waste my time. The third dongle I bought was just bulky and wasn't all that fast either. To quantify fast.... I use an ultrabook and I've been converting home video from other formats to .mp4 and editing them. I don't have a lot of storage on my ultrabook so I move VERY LARGE files to/from a NAS a lot.<br /><br />Anyway, this dongle is getting me the fastest transfer rates I've ever had. I'm sure my bottleneck is at the NAS at this point. It's also a pretty small dongle and easy to travel with...
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This app is GREATLY appreciated and I love it. watching the movie just made me love it but a game is A-W-S-O-M-E =)
B00BBW14YC|5.0|This May Be My New Favorite Movie! It Is The Story Of A Beautiful Relationship That Appeared Impossible At First. If Two People Are Willing To Learn, Grow And Change Then Anything Is Possible.<br />Excellent Soundtrack<br />Great Acting<br />Funny, Moving, Sad & Lovely
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Enjoyable game, even like the music! The graphics are good, easy to navigate. Like the different levels. Can't wait to get back to the game!
B00005QGAT|5.0|This one's the best of what the &#34;little abc, 123&#34; Michael has ever done.  This one reflects the &#34;real&#34; MJ.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This was a very intellectual and deep movie and I loved it. It was interesting to see how human characters were portrayed as animals or vise versa....you decide
B000AAF1U4|5.0|Now that my girl is off on her own, I was happy to buy this to get her own disney collection
B0049VZ222|3.0|From what everyone was saying about this show I thought that this would be awesome right from the start, but season one seemed a bit boring to me. Lets see how season 2 is
B000002HB4|5.0|Most people only remember the big hits but these guys have so many more great songs that people don't realise or have forgotten. This is just a great album of southern rock songs from a talented bunch of rockers that will make you feel good.
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|This is a very funny movie but I warn parents not to watch with children present. Opening scene is sexual in nature so make sure the little ones are put to bed before watching this outrageous comedy. I was sitting there thinking...&#34;Omg! This is my life!&#34; LOL!!!
0061339202|5.0|I work in consulting and this book helped me to understand, identify and manage workflow.<br /><br />I only had to read the first couple of chapters in order to realize the value of this book.<br /><br />If someone told me I only had 10 books to bring to a deserted island, I'm looking for this book first.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My kids loved this movie which of course is the main goal, but I do enjoy being able to watch movies with my kids that are somewhat interesting to parents as well. This one wasn't all that interesting from a parents perspective but as long as the kids like it then thats what matters
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Great album. They've got a wonderful sound and the lead singer has amazing voice. It's the kind of rock and roll I'd been craving for quite a while.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I found this book insightful as a women in the IT world. It allowed me to reflect on my own experiences and realize that there are many things that I can improve on. Some of the stories Sheryl tells are funny, others are dry. But, overall its a good read.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Shia LaBeouf was good, but Tom Hardy was awesome.  I love his movies.  he's a good actor and i love his accent
0345529057|5.0|I love these books. My favorite series ever. This is a great price and definitely worth the money. I promise that if you get through the first book you will be in awe of this world. WINTER IS COMING! Valar Morghulis...
B00BESLHEA|2.0|Too much graphic violence and language.  But I should have known that Quentin Tarantino's movies would be that way.  Hopefully, he'll tone it down in the future.
B009MF56GC|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my brother loved the movie so it was a great buy in book!!!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|No woman  in her right mind would be willing to be treated like a sex slave , and be a virgin. Not sure I want to read the whole trilogy .
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I love this game. The graphics are great, and the story line is good. There were a lot of HO areas, and the action kept me going. I was stuck for a while, until I learned to make good use of the Hint button. I got many hours of good play with this game. It played very well on my Kindle Fire HD. Can't wait for Part Two.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|So far so good. I just begun playing. For the first time I now know what a private eye has to go through.
0345522478|5.0|I was looking for a new urban fantasy series, and I am so happy I chose this one. I absolutely LOVED this book! All of the characters, even the minor ones, are very well-developed. Atticus is an awesome protagonist; he is not perfect and is totally believeable (well, as believeable as a 2000 year old Druid in modern times can be) but Oberon really steals the show! Kevin Hearne is a truly gifted writer. It is very refreshing to find a series that stands head-and-shoulders above the usual \\"monster erotica\\" junk. I am looking forward to reading all of the books in the Iron Druid series.
630018160X|5.0|Some of the best of<br />Bob Fosse<br />especially TGhe Rich Man's Frug.<br /><br />Wonderful to have.  I wish it had beden a DV D.  I guess I didn'tg read the small print
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|its fun to.play as all the different armies. its a shame that the war machine and iron patriot armies don't work the way I expected them to, with an automatic turret, but I still like the game
B00846REIS|1.0|I´m having doubts about actually finishing this book. The \\"relationship\\" between Gideon and Eva is seriously creepy and messed up. It´s really freaking me out. I liked FSoG and even though I found Christian Grey a bit much at times, Gideon takes the cake.<br />All they do is fight, have sex, fight, have sex. They know each other for like a day before deciding to go to couples therapy, suggested by Eva, who is the embodiment of emotional psycho bitch.<br /><br />This is not a romance novel, at all.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|THIS GAME IS FUN. It is an awesome kids game. I really do enjoy this game. This game has Great graphics...
B00846REIS|5.0|I was given this book was recommended by someone who was comparing it to the Greys serious.  I bought it to see if it is true, I have yet to read it.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|It is a fun game but I expected it to be different. I thought it be like an adventure roaming type game.
B004DSX5B6|5.0|This is a Suspension lightened slightly and with rubber gripping surfaces where the holes on the sides of the handle are on the Suspension. So all the same perks and problems. I think the Suspension is a great tool and have had two one stolen the other is now in my bug out bag, as I have a new Bear model. The case is small and barely held the Bear survival guide, (about the size of a watch warranty), and the tool. My old case still in good repair had lots of room for the tool and has a back pouch for the bit set.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I like the story, I like the settings. In all, season 3 streamed to our TV that's free (with Prime), you couldn't ask for more
B007ZI06FE|3.0|05/06/2013 --<br /><br />Overall Rating = 3.5 Stars<br />Book Cover / Book Blurb = 5 / 3 = 4 Stars<br />Writer's Voice = 4 Stars<br />Character Development = 4 Stars<br />Story Appreciation = 4 Stars<br />Worth the Chili = 3 Stars [$5.59 on Amazon]<br /><br />It started with a freebie. I got the second [a novella] free from Amazon the other day. The ratings were good, read the outstanding reviews of friends. But, the anal retentive part of me wanted to start the series and read in order. This is the first one.<br /><br />I have to say, I've never read Steampunk before. Not sure why, but I like it. This was a bit light on the mechanical devices and they sure didn't play a huge role, but it was good and great for my first foray.<br /><br />I liked quite a few things about this one:<br />1 -- The characters pulled you into this story. I loved Blade. I'm a sucker for a great male lead and he had it in spades. At first you're not sure if he is going to be a good guy or not. I actually went back to the blurb to be sure I wasn't getting the warmies for someone who wasn't going to be it, in the end. Nope, it was Blade. He isn't always likeable, but this is what makes him so great.<br /><br />Honoria had courage and spunk. She didn't whine about her lot in life. She accepted it, accepted full responsibility for her siblings and went about doing what was needed to ensure they survived as well as possible. Loved this girl.<br /><br />2 -- The secondary cast of characters were just as good a the MC's. You like them already -- which is a good thing because they will play out in this series.<br /><br />3 -- The whole Steampunk thing. I wasn't sure about it. I liked PN, but I have to really be in the mood. I was in a major book slump. I started 6 or so before I decided to give this a go. I'm so glad I did. I'm reading the second which is a shorter book. It is even better. I think it may be too early to say I'm a Steampunk fan, but I am a Bec McMaster fan for sure.<br /><br />4 --Isn't the cover beautiful? I think it is lovely. I looked at it several times as I was reading it. The guy on the front isn't my vision of Blade, but quite okay. It is still very pretty.<br /><br />What things didn't I like so much?<br />1-- Well, we have to remember this is a debut book. Ms. McMaster does and excellent job, but it did drag in places for me. Obviously, I powered through, but noticeable.<br /><br />2 -- I may be wrong, because this is my first Steampunk, but I think it could have had a bit more of this element in it. Maybe me, but it is almost like calling something a romance and it only contains a single kiss.<br /><br />3 -- The price for a debut book is a bit much. Not over the top, but a bit much for me with an unknown author [\\"new to me\\"], and a new genre'. This really lowered my rating -- coulda' been 4 Stars.<br />Note: I rarely spend more than $5. Don't have to.<br /><br />4 -- The blurb could have been better. There are so many books out there. When I read a good one, I want to tell someone what it would have taken to get me to read this book sooner. Whitechapel was a bit intriguing -- the whole \\"Jack the Ripper\\" thing, but does everyone know this? The significance of it? For me, this was the only selling point in the blurb. Nothing else stood out. READ THIS BOOK. Don't let the blurb sway you. It is a really good book. Promise.<br /><br />As mentioned before, this is a debut. I think the author did a really good job. I enjoyed the story and the characters. I'm going to read the next one and have pre-ordered the 2nd in the series [the next one is 1.5]. My first Steampunk down and I liked it quite a bit. I'm pretty pumped.<br /><br />Definitely give this book a chance. I don't think you'll be disappointed. I was surprised and entertained.<br /><br />Happy Reading!
B006GHA9QQ|1.0|I guess I just loved Phantom too much, but this was not what I expected. Alot of the songs were ...weird. And if you're a Phantom fan, there are alot of holes in the plot that you just can't get past. I was sad that this wasn't awesome :(
B0009RCPY8|1.0|Was Not happy to get my ghostbusters and the book was gone it said like new with all 2 discs and book the case was beat to heck not happy
B007G92QGO|5.0|A compelling story, not just a courtroom drama, but also the story of a family's nightmare where the complicated lives of moody teenagers clash with those of frustrated parents, who don't really know their children. Highly recommended if you are looking for a well-written book that is a bit of everything: courtroom, thriller and emotional. Well-done William Landay!
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Awesome book, I couldn't stop laughing. Even, in class I was laughing. Everyone would stare at me and I told them it was funny, but they ended up agreeing once I showed them it was a diary of a wimpy kid book.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game and very addictive. I could not put this game down until I had finished it, despite telling myself just 5 more minutes! Don't use the clues, I didn't. Can't wait for more.
B001FB55MG|5.0|the person I bought it for really seemed to like it. She is a big Adam Sandler fan. I watched it with her and enjoyed it too
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Yep...definitely worth the read...and WAY better than the movie in my humble opinion. This and Dear John are my two favorite of his more recent books. Though...I gotta say that I loved the movie ending of Dear John better!  :0
B00B2PO148|5.0|The book feels really nice material wise like the book wasn't made cheap and the artwork inside the book is beautiful and interesting!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game its both challenging and fun an  both me and my nephew can play it an  we all have fun.
B005D4YP0Y|5.0|First Pair of Keens and I like them very much.  Exceeded my expectations.<br />Extremely well made with premium materials, stitching, and fasteners.  Toe Guard is Excellent!<br />Very comfortable to start and quickly broken in.<br />Handles a variety of terrain with ease and confidence.<br />I'm glad I took other reviewer's advice and purchased the next size up.  I wear a 12 W and there was no half size available...13 works fine.<br />These have not yet been wet but all other reviewers praise the quick drying feature.  I think these are fine for street and easy trails but would take them as second pair / water shoes for serious hiking.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|An excellent series with great packaging. Came on time with no damage to DVD's or packaging. A definite must have for any fan!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Couldn't put it down!  Filled with so much love and feelings.  Excellent Read!  Love the way Jodi Picoult writes.  Amazing!
B0076DELIG|5.0|I love Michael Connelly. He never disappoints me. Just when you think Harry is done, he rises to the occasion.
B002TXZSLM|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and have quoted from it a number of times when I have conducted funerals. The quote below is worth consideration and the question that needs to follow is &#34;How do we NOT forget them?&#34;<br /><br />“What do people fear most about death? I asked the reb.<br />&#34;Fear?&#34; he thought for a moment. 'Well, for one thing, what happens next? Where do we go? Is it what we imagined?&#34;<br />That's big.<br />&#34;Yes. But there's something else.&#34;<br />What else?<br />He leaned forward.<br />&#34;Being forgotten,&#34; he whispered.”
B00AJAFNIA|4.0|great game, cute graphics, but I wish it would save your progress instead of starting on your journey from the beginning every time! its a great game!
B00992CF6W|3.0|kids wanted it. works ok when working but randomly stops and needs to be reinstalled. buggy. not the best app
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I loved all 3 seasons.  I did not like the finally of season 3.  They really need to change that.  Season 3 just can not end that way.  It's not fair.  I loved the characters and the plot.  Some of the characters I despise but it made it a good story.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Mahjong lovers will appreciate this fun addition to their Kindle's or whatever. The game can be played in a short time or more, depending on whether they are in the doctor's waiting room, or next up for job interview.
B00003CXRM|5.0|THIS SHOULD BE A MUST HAVE IN EVERY MOVIE COLLECTION... THIS MOVIE IS SO FUNNY IN HARMLESS WAY THAT IS NOT OFFENSIVE
B006H5120E|5.0|VERY HAPPY WITH THE QUALITY AND THE 3D WAS EXELENT TO ALSO THE SOUND BLEW ME<br />AWAY ONLY ONE THING WHY DID THEY HAVE TO PUT THE MOVIE OVER TWO DISCS<br />AS I HAVE THE DVD VERSION OF THE MOVIE AND IT'S ONLY ON ONE DISC PERHAPS IT'S<br />BECAUSE IT'S NTSC AS MY DVD IS PAL ??? ANY WAY IT'S GREAT.
B00BEWCJFM|5.0|I recommend this album for some more deep Maiden live cuts. All around great album and a must for your collection.
B000002H97|5.0|Great album, all the songs on the album are great, needed to replace my first copy cause I wore it out. A must.
0425263908|5.0|the storyline in itself was much better send 50 shades. they seem like normal people and not a fantasy the sex was way hotter and I love the way she uses her words to get right to the point. This book will make you wet just reading it. I could not have asked for more very satisfied in more ways than one! I wish I could find another series like that.
B006LSZECO|5.0|First, let me say this is a very good book.  It is twisted and disturbing and very creepy.  It was addictive and I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />If you're like me, and get totally engrossed in a novel as you're reading it, be careful reading this book if you're married and want to stay that way.  Maybe try reading a lighthearted romance book afterward to wash the taste out of your brain...
B009NY43NY|5.0|I am terribly sad to see her go but I have sincerely enjoyed the ride. Sookie is one of my favorite people in the literary world and though I will miss her I will undoubtedly visit her again soon. This last installment was breathtaking and I finally got the sweet moments with Sam I had been waiting for.While. I wish we had a Harry Potter-like epilogue complete with marriage and babies, I am still thrilled that Sook found her way to where I believed she needed to be. Who better to love our Sookie than the one to whom she was always special, even before her abilities were known?
193700788X|1.0|Having a degree in literature, I can tell you that this book is poorly written, and there's no way to get around that.<br />Many of the issues have already been covered in other reviews, but overall the problem is that the characters did not remain true, and the 'world' was changed in the eleventh hour in an attempt to accomodate plot changes. I always thought Sookie's character was changing and evolving throughout the series and was curious as to where she'd end up.  Well she ended up exactly where she started, and considering all of the life lessons she learned, that can almost be considered a huge regression.<br />I thought there was a message of diversity and acceptance in this series, but apparently I was reading something between the lines that was never there.  Sookie chose her tan and remaining in her only little microcosm over true love and an expansive interesting world.  So I guess what is new and different is essentially bad.<br />Charlaine Harris claims that this is the direction she envisioned for the books since book two and that it would all make sense in the end.  Well it the ending makes no sense at all and that is what most editors and publishers consider poor writing - when the author cannot convey accurately the image in their own mind onto the written page.  The disconnect here is that in her mind it ended right, but since she didn't convey the path to getting there in a logical believable way to the reader, it is just a disjointed mess.<br />The series was not about who Sookie ended up with but about her journey.  And her journey led right back to the start implying that the eleven books in the middle were just filler and the main character is not even likeable in the end.<br />This is without a doubt the single worst book I have read this year.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Great writing, fine acting.  Like stepping into a time machine.  The art direction is very fine.  Can't wait to watch the following episodes.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Time killing rail shooter.  Its fun to try out all of the different armor. It takes a significant amount of time to unlock them all, and theres not much variety to the gameplay. but as its free so you cant ask for better.
B0030FUAKW|5.0|The Walker Brothers hit London in the mid-1960s in a remarkable reversal of the British Invasion: UK schoolgirls were going hysterical at these three good-looking Americans -- not brothers and none really named Walker. The rich orchestration on their records, provided by classic pop arranger Ivor Raymonde, set them apart from other teen idols and sent Scott Walker (n&eacute;e Noel Scott Engel) on to a critically acclaimed solo career.<br /><br />But anyone nostalgic for the Sixties should watch out, because those records are not what you get in this Sony box set. Instead we have the three albums from the Walker Brothers' mid-1970s reunion, a desperate attempt to make some money after the solo careers of John Walker, Gary Walker and Scott Walker had hit their respective slumps. They announced their reunion in 1975 with NO REGRETS, a collection of 10 schmaltzy cover tunes. The music is uninspired country and western or soul, and through orchestration is sometimes used, it is more a lame effect here than something majestic integrated with the music. Scott Walker was struggling with alcoholism (on the album cover, he is shirtless and covering his face with a can of Newcastle Brown Ale) and though his baritone is great as always, one can hear that his heart is not in the material. The Walker Brothers' 1976 followup LINES can similarly be consigned to oblivion.<br /><br />But for fans of Scott Walker's late work, this box set is an essential purchase because of NITE FLIGHTS, released in 1978 and destined to be the last Walker Brothers's last album. With their record label about to go bankrupt, the three musicians decided to go whether their individual musical visions took them. John and Gary's songs are as forgettable as any of the covers on the previous album. Scott Walker's four contributions, however, are something from another world.<br /><br />\\"Shutout\\", \\"Fat Mama Kick\\" and \\"Nite Flights\\" sound like the pop music of the future (and still do, 35 years later). Though the backing is simple rock guitars, bass, drums and keyboards, in their lyrics Walker for the first time presents the surrealistic and uneasy imagery that would continue through his late solo albums. The fourth track, \\"The Electrician\\", is less enigmatic but much more disturbing.<br /><br />Shutout: \\"Throw off / Those gimmicks / To the boys / Let them / Send it all up / In the air / There is / Crouching and wailing / On stones / Down here / We must freeze off / This ratmosphere / Scraping out noise / Across night wires / Runs for the distant cities / There is never / A lock / In the fall / Down here / As the / BIG FULL / Pours away...\\" Far from the soporific vocals of the preceding albums, here Scott Walker engages and confronts the lister. There's a screaming guitar solo by session player Jim Sullivan.<br /><br />Fat Mama Kick: \\"Sunfighters / Locked in / Right angle rooms / Watch their lovers / Sleep face down / In the yellow lite / Keep the balance / On a back curve / 'Till the war / With the night Is over...\\" The vocals, on top of a 4/4 beat with saxophone and drums, are distorted as if heard through a filter. Chris Mercer goes all out with a saxophone solo near the end.<br /><br />Nite Flights: \\"The moving has come through / The danger brushing you / Turns its face into the heat and runs the tunnels / It's so cold / The dark dug up by dogs / The stiches torn and broke / The raw meat fist you choke / Has hit the bloodlite / Glass traps open and close on / Night flights...\\" The bassline on this track, played by Scott Walker himself, is extraordinary and the vocal expression possibly the most memorable of his entire career.<br /><br />The Electrician: \\"Baby, it's slow, when lights go low. There's no help, no...\\". Troubled by recent revelations that the CIA was torturing Central American insurgents, Walker depicted such interrogation techniques as a twisted romance, two lovers lustfully engaging in a bondage session. The vocal section lasts only about a minute, but it is of extreme emotional impact. Most of the song, the longest on the album, consists of orchestration, menacing and dissonant at the opening, lush and sweeping after the lyrics are delivered.<br /><br />Those who have not yet heard Scott Walker's late period should probably start with 1995's [[ASIN:B0000019R2 Tilt]]. But if his music proves as lifechanging for you as it did for me, you should go on to his other solo albums, and the four Scott Walker songs here are definitely worth the price of the whole set.<br /><br />(Verified purchase from another retailer)f extreme emotional impact.

B006ZAZ31U|5.0|One of the most inspiring books I have ever read! I couldn't put this book down and the end brought me to tears. I highly recommend this book!
B0097HSS4M|1.0|Disappointing. Too basic and not any better than any other photo editor app available, even the free ones. It was cheap so no great expense but I feel I got even less than my money's worth.
B00992CF6W|2.0|ive heard about minecraft how its awesome and whatnot but I honestly don't understand what's so good about minecraft. when I first got the game downloaded, I was like, ok so what do I supposed to do? I ended up just killing myself a few times by creepers, or just even drowning. but then again, ive also heard u get more stuff if u play it on a computer or xbox. so I'm just saying &quot;what is it really?? &quot; (is it just because I don't have an imagination and not creative? idk)
0307476464|5.0|I listened to the Audio Book of this Murakami, and having it read to me made it go faster. I also bought the hardcover edition for the \\"feel\\" of it.<br />This was a long book and I loved it. I didn't really want the book to end.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I was already excited to read the rest of the series, but after that ending . . . bring on The House of Hades! Wow. What an ending! I loved every minute of this book. Riordan has done a great job writing characters I care about and am invested in. He has developed strong bonds between those characters that make their interactions a pleasure to read, and he has great action and adventure throughout. Loved it.

0307476073|5.0|A compelling story, well written, with a great sense of humor and heart wrenching candor.  I highly recommend this book.

193700788X|5.0|I was leery of the last book in this series, because of all of the horrific reviews here on Amazon.com.  I read the book last night & have to say I thought Charlaine Harris did a good job of wrapping up this story.  I think most of the people who panned it were mad that Sookie didn't get her HEA with \\"their\\" guy.<br /><br />These Sookie Stackhouse books were consistently entertaining.  I didn't read them for the deep plot or to educate myself.  I read them because they were light & fun.  I think this book fits the bill.  CH gave us a lot of clues as to who Sookie was going to end up with, i.e. all the longing for babies, Sookie's continued repulsion to the idea of being turned.<br /><br />I felt obligated to come here & give a good review for this book, to try to balance out some of the vitriol that was being spewed by other reviewers.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Awesome Movie! The movie kept my attention the whole time.  I would recommend this movie.  It does have one sexual scene so I would not recommend for children.  But overall, Great!!  I loved it!
B008JF8O9M|1.0|You know what I'm talking about.  Tells you how great it is, and how it's going to be helpful, but doesn't actually work.
0751517089|4.0|Of all the finance books I have read this one remains near the top because of the value of the lesson. I really love the story that the author delivers particularly because it's one that will be familiar to anyone who wanted to work in the 'front office'. It's a great account of working as a floor trader and it shows the personalities of the bank in a very entertaining fashion.<br /><br />As a book about trading (in the raw sense) it's nothing unique. In fact for those wanting to learn to trade there isn't a lot to be found but that's not what the book is about (though if you need a practical example of why stop-losses are good then look no further). What you will find is the clearest explanation of why the boss of front office can never be the boss of the back office. This is not to excuse the actions of the author but you do have to ask how it was allowed to go on for so long.<br /><br />I guess it boils down to the predictability of money and people. The cover up job is certainly a big part of it but the boundaries of risk vs. reward can only be pushed so far before the reality presented is right out the window. The fact that the 'realities' were ignored serves as another illustration of the need for independent oversight with some risk management teeth. I could go on but better you draw your own conclusion of the rights and wrongs presented.<br /><br />This is not a long read. It is a remarkable tale and is told in a fashion where the stress can be felt pulsing out of the page. Well worth a look to continue to grow your knowledge of important aspects of financial history.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|As with most free Apps, the price is actually the time you have to invest getting past the advertisement.  It's a calculator - whoopee.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game.  Just too short is the only downside.  Please make more, Fireproof.<br />Would love to see a sequel to this soon.
B005NJU8PA|4.0|I use the meta learning chapters. Excellent stuff. Use this book to learn faster. Some of the veggie/vegan sections are useful yet limited. As far as cooking is concerned I would not recommend it to vegetarians or vegans (there are some good tips though). Of course this book is not meant for veggies and I do understand that. I'm a fan of TF's work. I would as a vegetarian have preferred a more meta learning specific version of this book. But hey, non the less this is a must buy and should be on any entrepreneurs book shelf.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|perfect quality, everything I expected. I love this movie, was thrilled to find an affordable version especially of such grand quality
B00CH87HF4|3.0|Tried finding a good action RPG for the Kindle Fire HD. Took a chance on Dungeon Hunter 4. Overall, I will say that I was impressed by the game. The enemies are varied, the enviroments are detailed, leveling is well done, gearing is interesting, and the controls function well. However, the way the game is structured, in order to play for an extended period of time, you will either need to stay in a zone you outgear/outlevel or spend copious amounts of money.<br /><br />The biggest problem with the game is the potion system. You are given three potions, you cannot hold any more. Once a potion is used, it is put on two hour respawn timer. There is no way to pick up potions, either wait for them to respawn in your inventory or spend real world money to get them back. So if you use all three potions to down a boss, it'll be around six hours before you get them back.<br /><br />If you do intend on playing the game and not spending any money, put your skill points into suvivabilty options and gem your gear for health generation. Be prepared to do lots of low level griding before you enter a new area.<br /><br />I would have probably spent between three to five dollars to unlock this game in it's entirety but in it's current \\"freemium\\" state, I don't know if it is worth having on my Kindle Fire HD, taking up space. When you can spend money to unlock high level gear and skills or unlimited potions, it takes away from the point of playing to win when you can pay to win. When the playing to win portion of the game is so heavily handicapped, it just isn't entertaining.<br /><br />UPDATE 5/13/13: Still play some here and there. Tested out PVP and found that potions in PVP work the same. So essentially, you can be immortal, as long as you are willing to spend money.<br /><br />It truly is a shame for this game. What is here, is excellent but the current format hinders it greatly. Free to play games with optional purchases should be for cosmetic content or extra content, not for the best in slot gear and removing the challenge from the game.the best in slot gear and removing the challenge from the game.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I'm upset thought that they have killed off two of my favorite characters!!! Why???????????? Why would you kill off the father of the newborn baby just when he is getting Abbey back in order and is so darned happy!
B003VPWXRO|5.0|Portia de Rossi really lays it all out there in this book and tells a scary story of withering down to less than 90 pounds. She tells of the obsession, the thoughts that she would have and I think it's a good read. Perhaps it's helped people who are struggling themselves to recover instead of fall deeper into the obsession.
B007TK77QE|4.0|Very well written and made me smile...good characters and overall very much worth the effort.  I definitely recommend this book.
B000YHG72E|5.0|I'd seen this movie numerous times before buying it, it's very funny and was a must-have for the Christmas DVD collection.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|At the time of my purchase this was $50, which was an awesome price to me. One of my favorite series of movies and books of all time and I am honored to have this. I do want something a little more in the future. Looking at the Wizard's Collection but I hear a lot of bad things about it.
0446585041|2.0|I had very high expectations for this book as I'm a big fan of Ellen, she's very funny and witty and she carries herself in such a way that you feel like the two of you could easily be friends; however, this book reads in such a way that you don't feel like you're in conversation with her, even though I'm pretty sure it's meant to read exactly like a conversation and it kind of goes all over the place. I read maybe half of it and just didn't feel the need to finish it. This will not, however, prevent me from trying other books she's written.
B009JBZH54|4.0|This collection is awesome and I am happy to have it. It was shipped very promptly after it's release date. The only small complaint I have is that the box was torn in one of the corners before I even opened it. I don't display boxes, just put the discs in a CD wallet and store the box, but I could see this being a problem for a collector that likes to display their collection.

B006FK7SZ4|1.0|The only reason I ever tried Badoo was because it happened to be with my phone. All that awaits you there are people who do not speak english as well as viruses (like the one that sent emails on my behalf to ALL my family/friends) which is not the best thing to happen.
B005LAII1C|5.0|We'd seen this in theaters before buying it and it was funny enough to buy, which should be recommendation enough. I only buy movies I will watch numerous times. Chances are the target audience for this movie is the audience that loves Family Guy, so keep that in mind.
193700788X|1.0|The ending was not unexpected, but it was incredibly disappointing.  After the 12 book story arc chronicling the Eric/Sookie relationship, to have it end like this with absolutely no closure was terrible.  And Eric did end up making extreme sacrifices for Sookie ... agreeing to a 200 year marriage, allowing Sookie a vampire-free life, all without her showing one little iota of gratitude.  His sacrifices were barely acknowledged.<br /><br />Also, Pam was such a good friend to Sookie, making Eric tell her about Freyda, that her response to the end of the relationship was simply anti-climatic (as was everything about the Sookie/Eric relationship in this book).  The only thing she has to say is that she is owed congratulations for being the new sheriff?  No comment on the fact that she can't see Eric for 200 years?<br /><br />And Bill actually relishing getting to tell Sookie about Eric's deal with Sam was bizarre.  While Eric made Bill tell Sookie about his original reason for returning to Bon Temps, Eric certainly took no joy in it.  And by the end of the last several books, Bill should have known he was hurting Sookie somewhat, and at least been less gleeful.<br /><br />Sam was not unexpected, but it was disappointing.  He was the only one she felt equal to when he made her a part owner of the bar; however, he is incredibly boring.  The relationship had no build up.<br /><br />Finally, there are tons of loose ends.  Who let Claude out of the Fae jail?  Who were his accomplices in Fae?  Who created the hex?  What will happen to Amelia and, as Sookie described it, her extremely powerful witch baby?  What about Hunter?  Who else knows about him from Claude?  What about Niall?  I can't believe he'd let Claude return to earth without otherwise providing Sookie any protection.  I thought maybe Claudine would make an appearance as Sookie's guardian angel, but was disappointed she didn't make a showing.  And was the miracle grow garden/yard really Niall's influence?  Or wasit excess cluviel dor energy (the wish was to \\"live\\" and Sam laid in the grass regrouping with nature)?  Anyway, too many questions, no closure, and the characters seemed to act, well, out of character.
0802473156|5.0|I have read this book several times over the years and this is the second copy I have purchased :) I sent my first copy to a friend of mine who was having relationship problems and both her and her husband read this book and now they have a great relationship!!! It has helped me to understand my husbands wants and needs and how he communicates his love for me in such a different way than myself... It has opened my eyes to new ideas and thoughts and has taught me how to think differently and how to see the way my husband thinks differently... I encourage anyone to read this book!!!
B00138KE5Y|5.0|This is a nice variety of songs.  I love Streisand, but sometimes an entire CD of her is too much.  This is a perfect compromise. How can you not love, &#34; You don't bring me flowers&#34;?  So romantic.... (my husband hates it.)

B00BEZTMFY|5.0|All that I expect when I purchase a DVD is flawless playback, the quality of the casing or speed of delivery doesn't ruin the experience of a movie quite like a poorly burned DVD with digital skipping and other issues. Fortunately I received the DVD with great timing, mint casing as well as flawless playback so it's a win/win/win situation :)
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I really enjoyed this thriller. While three was a little predictability in a few aspects, there were several surprises as well. Great fun!

193700788X|2.0|--MILD SPOILERS--<br /><br />To say I was unhappy with the end is an understatement.  Like many of Harris' readers I was an avid Eric fan.  I'm sure we all knew they wouldn't end up together; Sookie may have mentioned a million times that she didn't want to be \\"turned\\" and there were the many references to her maybe wanting children.  However, the lack of Eric's presence in the last book was just sad.  The way Sookie moved on after and never really grieved their relationship ending was shocking.  This is not because it wasn't going to end, but Eric being such a big presence since book 1, to fizzle out like that is just...tragic.  I had problems with the rest of the book, the situations, the characters not really living up to their past selves.  This book as a whole was a big disappointment, made worse since it is the conclusion of the series.<br /><br />I may not want to pick up another series from Ms. Harris if she doesn't want to really see the series through to the end.  This and a few books before just felt rushed and didn't have the heart of the rest of the series.<br /><br />I recommend not paying the inflated \\"Penguin\\" price for this book and borrow it from a friend or wait for the library to get it.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Outstanding!  Probably THE best battery app on the market.  It does everything you could possibly want or expect...and then some.  The thing that especially impressed me was showing what percentage of your battery is being used by the different parts of your device.  Very impressive.<br /><br />If you need/want a battery app, you might as well get the best...and this is it.  (And don't be a tightwad - pay the $2.00 for the Pro version.  Money...well...spent!)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is so very awesome and the best part is the place where the trains move and I get hit with them
B003NHRGSQ|4.0|Terrific series and really like the authors writing style.  The characters are well defined and I'm fully vested in their outcome .  gotta go. Third book ends to be read
B009T8XBBO|4.0|This game has a few elements going for it.  First, the storyline is charming.  You are a knight (Arthur) who is trying to heroically escort a beautiful princess and fix all of the damage caused by a recent devastating tornado.  Along the way, there are many tasks requiring quick thinking and skill.  There is even a dragon that needs to be defeated.  Time management is a factor because you get bonuses for quickly completing tasks.<br /><br />The next element going for this game is that the professionally done graphics are decent.  Weighing in at around 41 MB in used memory, this game is going to occupy a nice chunk of your device's memory.  However, it seems it may be worth it.  There are 50 levels, so there is playing time longevity.  The quality of music and sound is pretty good, and of course, you have the option to mute.  As at least one other reviewer noted, there is a pretty long delay when screens are loading (this is true on my Kindle Fire HD).<br /><br />Ok, now comes the part that really bugs me:  You pay 3.99 for the App., but then (according the game's description as written by the developer) you have the option to pay more for upgraded digital content.  That burns me up.  To begin with, the game is fairly expensive as far as Apps. go.  I have always felt that if you pay up front, all the special perks should be included by way of credits earned from successful game play. Since this is not the case with this game, it will cost this developer two stars.<br /><br />I'll finish by saying that this game really delivers as far as its elaborate detail and challenging tasks.  The storyline will appeal to many.  A negative to some might be that tasks at times can be tedious and repetitive.  Due to its complexity, I can understand why this developer is charging more than the average game typically costs. However, due to its initial price, I cannot understand why users have to pay for perks with actual money.<br /><br />Just a side note:  I noticed that there is a \\"lite\\" version of this game [[ASIN:B009T8X93O My Kingdom for the Princess Lite]].  The developer writes:  \\"TRY IT NOW FOR FREE, THEN UNLOCK THE FULL ADVENTURE FROM INSIDE THE GAME.\\"  In light of this, I see no reason to spend the 3.99 for this paid game version before trying the \\"lite\\" version for free.<br /><br />IMPORTANT UPDATE 5/7/2013 7:50 P.M., EDT:  I have just reviewed this App's description as written by the developer.  The language about this game having in App. purchasing features has mysteriously disappeared.  I am wondering:  Why wouldn't the developer just notify us that 1) it removed the option to make purchases for upgraded digital content, or 2) just come out and say that they made a mistake in the language first used in the game's description (??).  I really don't like when a developer does not come clean about its policies.<br /><br />So, perhaps all of our complaints made a difference. I have to admit, I've never had this happen before.  I want to be fair in my rating.  Based on the merits of the game alone, I think this game merits four stars at the most (the tedium and repetitiveness of the game were factors for me).  However, the developer's sly approach to this matter really wasn't fair to us.  When it comes to issues where money is involved, please just admit the truth.\\"lite\\" version of this game [[ASIN:B009T8X93O My Kingdom for the Princess Lite]].

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I bought.the first of the trilogy out of curiosity buy I highly recommend you get ALL AT ONCE. Sassy, exciting, unpredictable and a definite page turner
B003PIUBZS|4.0|Initially, I thought the show was bloody and crass, and without much depth. By the third episode I couldn't stop watching. Andy Whitfield, R.I.P was amazing as Spartacus, he brought a depth and charisma to his character, that will be hard for his replacement to duplicate. Lucy Lawless' character is manipulative,conniving, and just plain disgusting in some scenes, but her portrayal is amazing.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Less kinky more suspense and twists and turns. Will leave you wanting more. Spent days looking for books just like, was unsuccessful......
B00063F8B2|5.0|This is our favorite version of the soundtrack.  The songs have such happiness and cheer that reach this generations of kids imaginations.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book is nearly impossible to out down.  Great characters and a plot with more twists than your lower intestine.  A worthy read!  What are you waiting for?  Buy this book!

This is a staple in our kitchen and my kids love picking out delicious treats that we can all make together.  The authors are fun to read and the recipes are easy to follow with stellar results.  I haven't tried one recipe from the book that wasn't a hit.
B001AIY58O|4.0|great buy
B000HF6ZR0|5.0|This truly is my most favorite sci-fi movie! The story is intriguing and the message is completely true! we as people really are far more primitive than we think and we give ourselves far too much credit for having a brain when all we really do is use it to come up with more bad than good.... Why Jerry... Why... Why Jerry... Jerry... Why... Why.... ISN'T THIS WHAT WE ALL ASK OURSELVES EVERY SINGLE DAY!!!!!!! (except we don't call ourselves Jerry... ))<br />I think the actors do a very good job of being the characters rather than acting (except maybe samuel l. jackson... who i wish maybe was not in this movie at all... but its fine doesn't ruin it all together)...The background story with Stone and Hoffman is maybe a bit irrelevant to the overall story, but still doesn't take away from it... Overall... great...
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|I really cannot even call this a movie. What in the world were the people thinking, when they made this stinker? Even \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\" is much, much better than this. (At least it's a classic). This mess is not even watchable.
B008602KQI|2.0|Well I watched the movie... after constantly listening to the hype of how great it is and how fantastic Jennifer Lawrence is and blah blah blah...<br />#1. If other people didnt help and save her character - she would have been first to die!! she was not an amazing fighter and whatever like everyone describes this chick... whatever<br />#2. Jennifer Lawrence is not that great.. granted this movie doesnt necessarily require Anthony Hopkins talent... but still.. put some effort into it right? whatever...<br />#3. What kind of a country is this that readily allows the government to have their children kill each other? and how is this a good thing? did I get this wrong? i did not get this thing at all i don't think... ugh whatever<br />#4. Is there a reason the capitol people look like clowns? is it a commentary on the rich vs the poor?<br /><br />Maybe I'm the wrong audience and I didn't read the books (cannot claim to know much about the books)... but the movie and the premise is just lame... so stupid... and yes ... whatever...

I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED!!!<br /><br />This was yet another horrible Cruise movie! Of course the commercial for it made it look 200% better than it actually was! and what was the reason this movie was made with Cruise??? HE PRODUCED IT!! HE PAID FOR IT!!!<br />This monotone, nonsensical, mind-numbing, drab, dry, barren, stale, stupid, tiresome,^%&* [insert more adjectives if you wish] made me want to go to his house and demand he give me my 2 hours back and ask him to RETIRE!! I didn't even care that I spent almost $35 to watch it at the movie theater I just wanted my time and brain cells back!! I was so upset while watching this... this... whatever this was!! Mr. Cruise - STOP MOLESTING OUR BRAIN CELLS WITH YOUR STERILE, PAINFULLY BORING, AWFUL MOVIES!!!!!!<br /><br />Perhaps it would have been somewhat less debilitating were it not for Cruise and this ridiculous editing.

I am a HUGE fan of Kimbra. Her sound, rhythm, voice, colorful presentation, etc. is very captivating. One of the few albums I would consider a classic work of art. I'm really looking forward to her future ventures. I wish she were a local musician where I live so I could watch every one of her shows....

B005NWHE0O|5.0|If Bill Bryson decided to become a Nordic Ski Racer this is the book he would try to write.  There are few books that I can’t read in public this is one of them.  I laughed so hard it had to be put away on our plane trip.  Learning how to rollerski and the attempted races put tears in my eyes and I had the freakin’ giggles (I don’t giggle) for the rest of the day.  The beauty of racing through little Italian towns with snow covered streets made we think that I had missed something in the woods all these years…and that maybe sometime I’ll have to take the time and start on the Worldloppet Passport.<br />So, I’m a sometimes cross country skier.  When I’m into it I’m ALL the way into it and when I’m not, I’m not.  This book got one very important concept across to me…sign up and line up at the starting line and take what the day is going to give you.  I always have worried about times and places and waves but after reading this book I’ll be signing up and lining up for my first birkie this year and taking whatever the day gives me.  What a great book.
B004ZQBOK0|5.0|This was the most amazing CD ever!<br />I absolutely love BVB and I was a bit reluctant to buy a CD from Amazon but I was glad I did because this is an amazing CD that I can play in the car since we don't have a jack for iPhones!
B007T967X4|5.0|Was really addictive and refreshed what I had learnt at school which wasn't yesterday if I keep practising I may be able to do something with my keyboard
B005M2A4DE|4.0|As you might recall, I was very impressed with the 2nd half of series 6, but I recently discovered it was by far the better half.  Here's the episodes with synopsizes from the box, with a little review of each, as well as a review of series 6 as a whole at the end.<br /><br />A Christmas Carol:  The Doctor has one hour to save a crashing spaceship & a miser's soul - but what lurks in the fog?  The episode starts off really good with a nice light-hearted tone.  But when it becomes dark, it feels forced & contrived.  Good finish though.  A-<br /><br />The Impossible Astronaut/Day of the Moon:  The Doctor is summoned by the President in saving a terrified little girl from a mysterious space man then he has to mount a rebellion against an alien invasion dating back to the very beginning of human civilization.  I had a very bad feeling about how the season would turn out when I saw this episode.  It has some very good ideas & moments, but it's also a little too crazy at times for me.  B-<br /><br />The Curse of the Black Spot:  The Doctor must solve the mystery of the disappearance of a pirate crew at the hands of a beautiful siren.  Finally, a really good episode.  A<br /><br />The Doctor's Wife:  By following a Time Lord Distress signal, the Doctor puts Amy, Rory & his beloved TARDIS in grave danger.  We need more Neil Gaiman stories like this.  A+<br /><br />The Rebel Flesh:  A solar tsunami liberates doppelgangers from their human originals in a futuristic factory.  Can the Doctor prevent full-out civil war?  One of the most interesting stories of the season.  A+<br /><br />The Almost People:  The doctor must convince terrified factory workers to work with their doppelgangers to overcome a monster of their own making.  The ending setting up the next episode was a little too much for me, but other than that this was an excellent follow-up.  A<br /><br />A Good Man Goes to War:  The Doctor assembles an army to face the Battle of Demon's Run - and River Song has something to tell him.  Alright, let's be fair.  The first 30 minutes or so are excellent.  But when things started to go bad, so did the quality of the episode.  B+<br /><br />Let's Kill Hitler:  The TARDIS crash lands in 1930's Berlin, bringing the Doctor face to face with the greatest war criminal in the universe.  And Hitler.  More entertaining yet convoluted writing.  B+<br /><br />Night Terrors:  Every child is scared of monsters, but George's terrified pleas for help reach the Doctor because George's monsters are real.  A really good single episode story.  From this episode on, I knew I would love the new Doctor Who series.  A+<br /><br />The Girl Who Waited:  Amy is trapped in a quarantine facility for victims of an alien plague.  Can Rory save her before she is killed by kindness?  A beautiful, thought provoking episode.  A+<br /><br />The God Complex:  The TARDIS lands in a hotel where every visitor's room contains their deepest, darkest fears.  What lies in wait in the Doctor's room?  Another classic episode.  A+<br /><br />Closing Time:  The Doctor's final days are upon him - but when he drops in on an old friend, the Cybermen are waiting.  The sequel to the Lodger is superior to its predecessor.  A<br /><br />The Wedding of River Song:  By the shores of Lake Silencio, in Utah, all of time & space hangs in the balance - because this is the day the Doctor dies.  The setup for this episode was painful at times, but the payoff was worth it.  A+<br /><br />And now, as River Song would say spoilers!  I assume you have seen both series 5 & 6 if you are reading this.<br /><br />What can you say about a season where most of the high points were filler?  I must confess the only other full seasons I've seen of the new show are 1 & 5, but from what I can tell the previous story arcs were alot better than this. The Bad Wolf subplot was interesting & had a good payoff, & the one about the cracks in time was so good.  And while those seasons had bad episodes, you could justforget about them (except for the one where Rory died, but I don't mind just watching that scene again by itself).  While this season is technically better than the previous ones as no episodes are pure agony, the low points are very mixed bags, and they're all part of the main plot.  Where did Steven Moffat go wrong?  He wrote such good stories before this.  As far as I know, none of his episodes before this season were below A in my book, but this season he only wrote 1 really good episode with the last one.  He still comes up with some very creative ideas (the Headless Monks & especially the Silence, who are probably the scariest monsters in the whole franchise), but the stories could have been a lot better.  I must admit the thread about the Doctor dying was excellent but in my opinion where Steven Moffat really botched it up was with the identity of River Song.  While on further reflection I have to admit that her being Amy & Rory's daughter is interesting & does make sense, she could've have just grown up & regenerated into her after they died.  She didn't have to be cruelly stolen from them as a baby.  I'm sorry but THAT is the nadir of this season, perhaps of the franchise.  It felt incredibly contrived, & was a very bad move to increase the drama.  It was like Marvel Comics during the 90s and beyond, when title by title, they destroyed various series at high points with an overload of angst.  The Hulk is no longer angry all the time?  Let's kill off Betty Ross!  Spider-Man is happily married to Mary Jane & expecting a baby?  Let's make the baby a stillborn then a few years later have him sell his marriage to the devil to heal his elderly aunt!  And so on & so forth.<br /><br />But despite all that, I give this season 4 out of 5 stars, because the good episodes are still really good & with a little selective continuity &/or rewriting here & there, it's an awesome season.  I only hope the 7th series is better than this.
193700788X|1.0|As  someone who has followed this series since the beginning I must say my love for the book series has died a bloody death. I fell in love with the characters and the author systematically killed them in my eyes with this final book. It is so sad and tragic to have it end in a slew of inconsistencies and overall poor writing. I am not going to regurgitate all the spoilers and tragedies of this final book because I am sure you already know from the other reviews but I will say that I will endeavor to banish this last book from my memory and follow the true blood tv series which is loosely based on the book series and not fated to end or follow in the direction that the books followed. I will not kick charlaine when shes already down but thank her for giving us the storyline of true blood even though she decided to annhilate it in her book series.<br /><br />So for all sookie stackhouse fans...all hope is not lost! We still have True Blood coming back in a couple of weeks so please stay strong in light of this recent tragedy.
0670026603|5.0|Ever felt like the awkward one, the one most forgotten, that somehow i all the fuss of life your voice you mattering got lost along the way. Then read lou and will story. Its not really about each separately but them as a whole. Its nice to know that sometimes someone gets you.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This was the perfect solution to watch the walking dead episodes that I missed. I easily rented the item and watched it on my xbox with in a minute.
B00101ZOTK|5.0|great plot, co-worker recomended in passing. Was this ever in theatures?<br /><br />so happy that i check it out online, i bought a second copy for the actual home dvd library ^^
B00448SE4S|5.0|Anyone who loves comic books and anime will love this movie. I laughed the entire time. Defiantly a movie I will watch again.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|The game freezes quite often, games get lost and not credited back most of the time. They need to work out the glitches.......
B000002LK1|5.0|I want to start by saying that I am a huge DM fan. It started for me with their Some Great Rewards cd-once I heard that cd I was a fan for life. I have this on cassette and have been getting the old cds for my collection-I have not listened to this in many years-the non hits I mean.<br /><br />Their music has affected my life so much especially when I was young and lost. Their lyrics and dark music was exactly how I felt. I felt that I was not alone in how I felt.<br /><br />The cd-I actually like the non-hits much more than the hits-maybe because I have heard them so many times on the radio and MTV(when they actually played videos). My favorites are Halo, Waiting for the Night and Blue Dress-haunting beautiful music-it was wonderful rediscovering them after so many years. It was like visiting an old friend again. There was only one song that I did not care for on this cd and it was the Sweetest Perfection.<br /><br />I have seen them twice before when they were touring for Some Great Rewards and for Black Celebration-it has been over 25 years since I have seen them live-way too long. I have bought all of their Live Concert DVDs and they are great but it is not the same as seeing them live with all of the live energy of the other fans. They are opening their 2013 concert tour in the USA in Detroit-I will be there front and center smiling and screaming like so many other fans.<br /><br />Great band!
B0091REZMW|2.0|Crashes all the time or won't open. But when working it is fun to play.  Would like to see these issues fixed.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|What can you say? It's Dylan. He's been around forever but still has a lot to say. He's a national treasure.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This FREE app is very much like Temple Run, but with enough different about  it to make itself it's own app. Great way to waste time if you`'re bored.
B00AN93Q0O|5.0|Love this CD. All the songs on this cd are awesome truly just a great cd. Not a bad song on it.
0062238868|5.0|It opened my eyes to some of the reports about the war in the Media.Some of the language was pretty rough but I understand that made it more real.I would recomend it to anyone interested in the war.
B0029BXMAI|5.0|Lost of sense of humor, very mucha what si critized about politics today is in the series. You laugh a lot. Really amusing
193700788X|2.0|The ending of this series was a serious let down and all the characters just seemed like they were making cameos throughout the book. (Spoiler!) Seriously, the big bad was Claude... that is just repeating the last book, then she ends up with Sam WTF?. Also the new layout in which it was written was really annoying, like she was trying to put it script form and detach it from the main character, it felt really disjointed at times and did anybody feel like Sookie was just bleh as the main character. I am so disappointed at the fizzle the end of this series produced.
0756404738|5.0|My boyfriend has read this at least twice, he loves this book and the author.  Would recommend to read this for sure!
B00979CS50|3.0|I have to totally agree with Zinc55's review of this album - not one of my favorites either.  In fact I have a hard time listening to it at all (and I try).  I've been a dedicated NY fan since the Buffalo Springfield days, seen him and Crazy Horse and CSNY live several times over the years, and I think this album is merely so-so. To me, Greendale was the last good album of songs and music he put out - the concept was really unique.  There are a few interesting moments, musically, in this but much of it seems like recycled tunes we've heard before.  I don't expect a return to the 70's era, but would've liked to have seen a little more evolution from what's been released in the last 20 years. The extended jams on this record, to me, are not so much jams with Crazy Horse as they are self-indulgent solos, with Crazy Horse providing background.  Maybe it'll grow on me. Sorry Neil.
0817439390|5.0|Great read. Easy to understand and very informational. Every time I open the book I learn something new. Its worth every penny! I was tired of borrowing it from the library and decided to full on commit. You should too! You wont be disappointed.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|Love this game, best game i have ever played on kinde fire, Invite me to a guild please names nestira
193700788X|1.0|I have been a fan of Sookie and her story for a long time. I found these books humorous and filled with strong, interesting characters. I never thought they were the written by the world's greatest writer, but wow did she have the knack for drawing me in regardless! Books 10-12 started to give the impression that the author was either bored with the universe she created or overwhelmed by the sheer volume of it and the story suffered, but I was still excited to see Sookie through to the end. I have had May 7th marked on my calendar for months and was counting down the days until my copy arrived. Imagine my surprise, after following these characters for twelve books, when I felt like I had jumped into a completely different series that just happened to have the same character names. Each page that I read seemed like a stab in the back. People that I have loved were thrown to the wayside with little explanation and storylines were created just to bring back every possible person that Sookie has met. The book felt both rushed and bored somehow. Rules of the Sookie universe were changed and/or broken to fit the story the author decided to tell with little regard for continuity. I would have been fine with almost any ending to this series if I had been brought there logically, but I just can't wrap my head around what goes on in this book. Hasn't Sookie been telling us her thoughts and feelings for twelve books? I just don't know how I misunderstood so much. I honestly wish I could un-read this book because it taints my memories of the rest of the series. What an awful end to what had been an incredible journey.
B006YTTVHO|1.0|This books title is misleading! It sounds like it's going to help a person become a better conversationalist,but this book is written for people who  are living in the basement of their mothers house playing video games while the only friends they have are on  Facebook. If you are totally incapable of talking  to a live person than this book is what you need.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Once I picked up this book I could not stop reading. I enjoyed every page. I have recommended this book to all  my friends
0062059963|5.0|SPOILERS AHEAD<br />*****<br /><br />So I loved the book and counldn't put it down, however after reading a lot of the reviews posted a lot of people are upset about America going back and forth between Maxon and Aspen, she loves Maxon, no she loves Aspen, no she loves Maxon, no she loves Aspen and I get it!  However you have to remember that she is 17 years old and when you are 17 you are very confussed about life and what you want and she has her first love there complicating her feelings for Maxon so of course she would be torn!  I get that when she is with one of them she feels she loses feelings for the other, but when your with that particular person of course all you think about is your feelings for that person and doubt your other feelings for the other it's only natural.<br /><br />I really was rooting for Maxon throughout the whole book series, but I was devasted to see him do what he did with Celeste out of all the girls he had to do that with her and his reason behind it cause he was lonley and was just using her while he knows she's just using him come on!  I lost a lot of respect for his character and don't know now if I want America with him anymore!  He will really have to prove himself in the finale book.<br /><br />I think America should tell Maxon that her first love is there so that he may realize that his actions may push her towards the other guy and that what he does with the other girls may result in her leaving him for Aspen.  I don't think she should tell him who he is, but he should no that way he may realize he will have to fight for her instead of the reverse.<br /><br />I get why America was upset about seeing Maxon and Celeste, but she was off doing the same thing with Aspen, but I do see her point to Maxon about why it had to be her of all the girls there and that she is so horrible!  I think seeing it hurt her the most, I think she knew he was probably kissing other girls, but to see it hurt her the most.<br /><br />Anybody else haveany thoughts?
0307001369|5.0|As a professional, I love the Richard Scarry books. They are especially wonderful for bilingual children. The illustrations are colorful and creative. I see the children love these books.
B004J64QSI|5.0|I love the movie and thought I want to see the theater version<br />Of it. I love all the songs. It's awesome!
B009NY43NY|4.0|It was very suspenseful and kept you guessing.  I loved it and like the way everything was brought together.  If you have read the series and liked it you will not be disappointed.  Like usual the books are much better than the TV series.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I never leave reviews but this got my attention. I did complete it in 3 hrs but  look forward to more in the future. Not worth price charged as it only takes a short time to complete And I'm a 1 time game round person. So will not play again since its complete. I'll let my kids at it to see how they do. But recommend getting it if it goes on sale.
B00006L85B|5.0|You have to listen and see his concerts. Luis Miguel is the Frank Sinatra (x10000 if you ask me) of Mexico. No one like him.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|A really good MJ collection , and some time later i got the autorip feature that let me have mp3's of the albums.<br />Nice deal indeed.
B003SI3URQ|3.0|The movie is great for little kids in the ages of 4 thru 9. My son, who is 13 had to watch this movie for a report. He was kind of bored of the movie and he kind of said that it was a waste of money. So it would be great for children, but not for middle schoolers.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|What can be said?  It is the complete Star Wars saga in one convenient box.  My husband was thrilled and has already nearly worn them out.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think subway suffers is a real good game because you earn money,you can unlock different characters.My 2 year old sister can play subway suffers really good.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|A very good book, very different the movie.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a classic children's tale
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I have no words... I can't believe it's over.  Thank you Robert for creating a world I called home for many years.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I couldn't get to the words I wanted because it so huge and full of nonsense that I usually used a real one then without touching it at all it would put me a thousand pages away!
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I am the only person who does not like this game it sucks all my friends are telling me to get it sucks
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Never cared for this type game where you have to three of something in a row....this game is challenging and addicting!!
B0090CVJZ4|4.0|Good banana plugs, got the job done. However, a couple details that took out one star:<br /><br />- This is not so &#34;obvious and easy&#34; to assembly, so a little paper with basic instructions would be appreciated.<br />- To be able to screw them tight, had to remove the plastic black/red rings. Not a big deal, some nail paint and/or the cable color coding solves this.<br /><br />Bottom-line, I'm happy with the purchase.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is an intense work out in only 20 minutes! There are 3 levels of 20 minute workouts that provide intervals of cardio, strength and abs.  Jillian is extremely motivating as well.  Intervals are a way to really challenge your body.  If you want to get toned and drop a few pounds quickly, get this DVD!  Level 1 is pretty intense, it took me a long time to move up to Level 2!  This is one of my favorite DVDs and I love that you get a full work out in 20 minutes.
B00CE6E6B2|1.0|I had this in my phone and I really liked it I got up to a very high level and then it crashed! so I saw that this was on my kindle and though I would give it a try. I was too optimistic. I was at level 8 when it kicked me out of the game when I went back in it it was back to the very beginning. This is really annoying don't bother playing it not worth the aggrivation.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Having been a long time fan of this series, it was impossible NOT to have to read the conclusion!  But, what a disappointment!  After all this time, the main character and the fans of the series deserved so much more.  If Mrs. Harris was true to both fans and the series this book would have taken more time and effort to close more loopholes.  As it stands, a companion books is needed to tie everything together!  What a copout!  Very disappointed to say goodbye to a beloved series in this manor!
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|IVE played worse but this is not that bad i mean it not as good as the originals hi hi
0451228731|5.0|It took about 1/3 of the book before I realized I was thoroughly hooked. I attribute that to various factors, including (a) getting used to this author's style; (b) getting to know the characters; and (c) the increase-over-time of more sci-fi/cyberpunk. But wow, once it got going, it just kept climbing and climbing and does not let up! I just downloaded the second book and can't wait to start it!
B003Z39G0O|4.0|I realy like it, but am looking forward to more of the Soundtracks from other Seasons.<br />When will they by out ?
B0013ND30M|5.0|As I mentioned in my review of Lady and the Tramp, I love to snuggle on the couch and watch Disney movies.  This particular one happens to be my granddaughter's favorite and we watched it together over and over. Priceless.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Was a good read. I love the happy ending. Was great that the f word wasn't in the story any place. Thanks.
B0061QD82E|5.0|I love to snuggle with my grandkids on the couch  and  watch Disney movies.  I saw this movie in the theatre  when I was a child and was so happy to see that it &#34;came out of Disney's vault&#34; to purchase. This movie is a classic.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game because I can't interact and playwith the horse and love horses but where I live I can't have a real one and this game is amazing. The only thing they could add that respond on the voice of the person.
B009NY43NY|2.0|Ok, so the last book did give us readers some insight on what to expect. I love Eric. Let me say that first. He is my favorite!!! But I know Sookie was going to end up with Sam and in fine with that. I thought the book felt rushed. I wish CH would have gone more into that relationship instead of ... Ah maybe we will be together forever or maybe he will leave me now and I'll survive. What the ??! That really upset me. So besides being rushed and the ending lacking. I'm okay with how it ended up. We have seen this coming but why they long lead up to Sookie and Sam and basically just end it? Very disappointed with the end of my favorite series :(
B009NY43NY|1.0|I purchased the kindle version and stayed up reading it last night.  I had to force myself to finish it, not because I was tired, but I was so bored.  What the heck was Mrs. Harris thinking!!!  She just gave up the dream, obviously because that was not the way to end this.  Where did this love for boring Sam come from?  Why destroy Eric the way she did?  While I am glad she created the characters, I am so happy she has nothing to do with the actual show.  She let me down and I can honestly say that I would sue her for a refund if it was worth the effort!!!!  Now, I am going on to the world of Jeaniene Frost and Lara Adrian.
B009NY43NY|5.0|While I am sorry that the series is over, this was a good book.  I heard about the spoilers, I did not read any of them.  I like the way it ended.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Love his singing!  I could listen to Josh all day!
B009T8XBBO|5.0|Got this on my original kf (not hd). Everything is smooth graphics are fine. Reviewers keep talking about iap's but i have yet to come across anything asking for money. Im on the second island and around level 17 or 18. I have not once been asked to pay for anything. Highly recommend this!
193700788X|5.0|I was so excited when this book showed up in my kindle yesterday morning and I finished it this afternoon.  I loved this book as much as I loved the other ones.  I thought it was a nice little end to the series.  I am not sure what everyone is fussing about.  I loved it.
B00C1XZ2LQ|5.0|After listening to the film score for the last 2 weeks, I'm finally ready to review.  To say the score is an audio treat isn't saying enough.  This is a thoroughly enjoyable score with memorable themes and a robust range of emotion.  The collaborative efforts of Anthony Gonzalez (M83) and composer Joseph Trapanese have produced a score that's now on my favorites list.  I first listened to a few tracks from a friend and easily made the purchase here for the album.  Usually for me, an album produces a number of tracks I enjoy significantly more than others; this one is different.  The tracks flow very well together when listened to sequentially, so you'll get the feeling you're experiencing a worthy tale, whether you've seen the film or not.<br /><br />Some of my favorite tracks, though, are; Waking Up, StarWaves, Odyssey Rescue, Canyon Battle, I'm Sending You Away and Fearful Odds.  However, all of the tracks are well made, emotive and to be considered as audio candy!<br /><br />As a very small background on my enjoyment of film scores, I've been a fan of them since 1975, long before YouTube and other venues brought us fans together to make the world realize that we're a \\"musical fan force\\" to be reckoned with.  :-)  Some of my all-time favorites are Jaws (my first score listened to, purchased, and revered), Close Encounters of the Third Kind, The Dark Knight Rises (Complete Version) and \\"all things Jerry Goldsmith.\\"<br /><br />If you're a fan of film scores, the $6.99 you'll spend on this will be well worth it.  To Anthony Gonzalez and Joseph Trapanese, please by all means, produce more scores together!<br /><br />For more on M83, go here,<br /><br />  [...]
B00004RFCM|5.0|I really love this series; I saw a few episodes on TV and decided to get the dvd's so I could see it in sequence.  It is so funny and realistic.  I like the characters- they are so very realistic and you can relate to them.  I highly recommend this dvd
B008OOYALE|4.0|Needs to update kind l e version add breed temples x2 fun game but difficult to breed the right dragon  they need  to have a update button

B004SMDJ9U|3.0|I love this show and bought both season one and two on DVD. The DVD came nicely packaged from the seller, and appears to be new, but it skips and stalls. There doen't seem to be any scratches, and I've tried playing it in my DVD player and my lap top but it still skips.<br />The show gets 5 stars from me but the DVD quality gets 2 stars.
B0071DJZZA|5.0|I loved it its to bad I can't afford the second book. Katniss and  Peeta where amazing I could feel the love between them
B005HSL626|5.0|What a fun game!  I've spent hours playing this and it's so much fun.  Glad I stumbled across it because it's a great way to pass some time.
B002SQ3664|4.0|This is a worthy story of the Woodstock music festival, told through the experience of a young teenager who lived nearby. Woodstock was an historic event on many levels, not the least of which was the fact nobody had really ever tried to put on a festival quite like this one before. And many who participated tried to avoid doing so again. Nonetheless, the festival was a major turning point for the music and musicians of the time, for those who attended, for music festivals in general, and for the business of rock music, not to mention society as a whole. To have it told in this manner adds a worthwhile perspective to the story, and captures the time and place very well.
B002PQ1PDS|4.0|Great set of songs but my son recommends getting the cassette of it for a warmer sound. He said the vinyl was very thin.
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|This is the best game in the world!! It's like jetpack joyride in a way.<br />I don't realy know how to explain it though
B000JMKQX0|1.0|This book is probably one of the worst books I've ever read.  I love zombie books, but this one was a snooze fest.  To be fair some of the stories were very interesting but the majority of them were full of so much military war $&@ that it took away from the appeal of survivor stories.  I would not recommend this book and only gave it one star because I had to give it something!
B009NY43NY|1.0|I've read this whole series. And if I'm being honest with myself, for me, the series peaked at around book 4 or 5 and has been a slow downward march to this point. And I was really sure it could get worse than the last book. There was a part of me that was really hoping that this book would recapture the energy that was earlier in the series and the limited character set. I was wrong. I feel like when I read this book and pretty much everything on the downward slide that writing these books had become more of a chore than a work of love.<br /><br />Some of this is strictly my problem I believe. There have been entirely too many characters as the series went on. So when I opened this book I found myself struggling to remember who these people were (aside from core characters), why they are remotely important and generally speaking the story line from the last book because the last book was that bad. Apparently one needs remember pretty much everyone you ever encountered in Bon Temp for this book and then learn at least one new character (maybe more but since I couldn't keep track of all the other ones I can't tell for sure).<br /><br />I never really read these books for the mystery/crime solving aspect. I always read for Sookie's interpersonal relationships. And as the series went on the writing around those things has suffered. Sookie has become a shell of a character. Not the well developed person I was used to in the first books. So this book was no different which left me disappointed.<br /><br />Possible Spoiler's Ahead....<br /><br />With the last book I would have wanted some stuff tied up a little nicer. Like pretty much everything. I care more about what these core characters are doing versus all these ancillary characters that came out of the woodwork. I would have loved see more Pam for example.<br /><br />And Eric... I mean really what is there to say about that disaster that hasn't already been said. There's a dynamic character whose story line was just kind of cut off with a dull meat cleaver. Kind of like, \\"We're done with you now lets just throw you away.\\" I had no feelings about who she should end up with relationship wise but for goodness sakes this has been a major character in many books and really?<br /><br />And Bill. I've been wondering where he's been. And I've always hoped for more friendly interactions. He too was a major character in some of the books (and other he pretty much didn't exist). That was a disappointment too.<br /><br />Sam. Basically unrecognizable the entire story.<br /><br />And so on. And then it just ended with this ending that had no lead up to it in any of the last books though it wasn't a surprise at the same time. I wish the \\"ending\\" would have came much much earlier in the book and that the the majority of the mystery would have been wrapped up much earlier as well and the relationships and lives of these core individuals wrapped up a little better than it was.kind of cut off with a dull meat cleaver.

B004EI924E|5.0|This movie stars Bruce Willis and Morgan Freeman as retired CIA agents. It's decided they have information that is dangerous if it got out, so they are put on a hit list, listed as R-etired E-xtremely D-angerous, which explains the name of the movie. It also has John Malkovich and Helen Mirren. The chase is on to eliminate Willis and it's a VERY exciting cat-and-mouse game. A must see.
193700788X|1.0|Editing this due to the 5 star people assuming you only hate book because of who she ends up with!!<br />There are rules when you world build. She may as well have made vampires shop in daylight and say \\"Oh yeah, didn't you know they could do that?\\"<br />To CH..<br />I loved the world you built Ms. Harris. Story boards help authors recall important details. Like who was raped...or mind reading. Or who was part fairy and could live longer than a human....<br />Ms. Harris, I loved these books long before TB. I even purchased your other series because I was impressed with your ability to tell a good story. I even loved Sam. But what you did was equivalent to Hermione betraying Harry, or Darcy cheating on Elizabeth with Kitty.  When George R Martin kills off a character, it may suck....But, at least it makes sense.<br />Your clever writing of Eric and Sookie was so good, it sold you books because people wanted to follow that relationship. I loved Sam, and I knew you said from the beginning, Sookie would not end up with a vamp. Ok...but then why did you write such a lack luster brother sister relationship between Sam and Sookie? You had the ability to create this world. You knew they would be together...WHY in the flipping world wouldn't you have had  even one sex scene, have Sookie daydream or bring up their one and only  steamy kiss to foreshadow what may happen?  Sookie knew how he felt and  could read thoughts. His thoughts. What happened with the writing? Settling for normal is not a paranormal fantasy. You were not writing the<br />Mary O'Reilly books. You were writing a VAMPIRE series.<br />( editing...I was wrong in that there had been a kiss....This seemed to prove my point, in that Sookie never thought of Sam after that. If you kiss someone, and it is awesome...you will be thinking of that when you talk to the person..etc. If she could go off to meet his family ( another reason some felt it had to be Sam) then why not bring up memories of that kiss and kiss again? It is why I never felt it could be anything more than that guy friend we all have that is the one you take to weddings or office parties if you don't have a date..the guy you can call up and do things with because you have a history that is beyond sex.<br /><br />( editing to add the next critique ) Eric was a vampire, silly....how could that have worked? First of all, Sookie wasn't human. She is part fairy and seems to me when CH made her that, she gave her the potential for an increased life span. She has also had a ton of vamp blood...another reason to prolong life span. I hate when author's build a world, then forget the world they built.<br />Ok, if CH was dead set against Eric, fine. Did she need to completely make his character a jerk and then sell him into sex slavery? Really? CH thought that wouldn't garner anger from the EL's??? Have a scene ( and she is talented enough to do this....) Where Eric is picked as King...Sookie won't turn and he can't have her as his wife if she isn't a vamp. Or she will really be in danger now, so he has to let her go...Whatever. Or Kill Eric. Have her so upset she turns to Sam for comfort. There are ways to please everyone. Not that everyone would have loved it, but could see it happening. Titanic the movie doesn't have the HEA, but...it was written well enough, we the audience, could appreciate it.<br />( editing to add next critique of 1 star reviews.....)<br />People are complaining that 1 star review people don't get it \\"This is not a romance. It is a mystery\\". I have read mysteries. I am reading George RR Martin right now, and there is sex but certainly not considered a romance. I just my new Jane Yellowrock. Not a romance. This series is a flipping romance. She is married to Eric for gosh sake.<br /><br />What CH did was just mean to people who have made her a very wealthy woman. She must think so little of us all. Read JK Rawlings writings about how her fans influenced her writings to keep Ron alive.<br />Won't ever buy another book from CH. Can't trust she won't just change directions of story line as often as she did POV in this last book.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like how the game never ends. The added quests are excellent. An excellent game for anyone who likes find it games.
1616550414|5.0|It's just great to see the actual artwork they do when developing the game. It's also great to have the official timeline of the Zelda series, a lot of your questions will be answered by reading this.
1419707663|5.0|I gave Diary of a Wimpy  Kid Box of Books 1-3 a rating of 5 stars! My son loved the books, reading all three in one week.<br />The packaging is great for storing and keeping books together and neat! I would recommend this book to readers of all ages, you will laugh and it helps the children to learn ways to write in a Journal... Must buy!!!!!!!!!!<br />I just ordered Diary of a Wimpy Kid Box of Books 4-6. My son age 6 does not want to trade 1-3 books, he is going to read them again. Funny!
B00BUCW54Q|4.0|I thought Tom Cruise did a great job as the character Jack Reacher. I haven't read the book so, I didn't have an opinion going in.
1616550414|5.0|I got this cheaper than retail when I pre-ordered it. I can't believe they sold it cheaper for the pre-order but it's a great book none-the-less. If your a fan of TLOZ, you need to have this book!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is amazing and it shows great kindness. Such a simple thing. I loved how much courage is in this book. I recommend this book to everyone. This is truly a wonderful book. Everyone deserves to see the genuine kindness deep down in all people.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|love the variety in the free app! especially the different types of melodies. the waves are some of the best I have heard.
B00B7HQ1DA|5.0|After listening to the samples, I went ahead and ordered it and I am really glad I did.  It's a well-engineered, great sounding album and Boz sounds better than ever.  My audiophile husband was even impressed as he was never a big Boz Scaggs fan. I think this album might have changed that.  I definitely recommend it, not a bad song on it. Gone Baby Gone, So Good To Be Here, Corrina Corrina and a couple others are sweet and soulful, perfect to put your girl in the mood, if you have trouble with that sort of thing. Just keep your mouth shut and let Boz do the talking.
B001G0LBZ6|4.0|Good music and you get two CD's which is nice.  Seems like the same artist is featured a lot, but there is still variety.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Brandon Sanderson has done a wonderful tribute to wheel of time series and it just perfectly fit the story! Engaging and the sense of adventure never leaves! It draws you in and won't let you go. Thank you for finishing it. I have been reading this series since my girls were a sparkle in my eye, I have always loved the tales. Now words can express how much I enjoyed not only this book but the entire adventure! Thanks
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm a sucker for first-person narrative, and this hit the sweet spot. Great background, storytelling, and characterization. This is probably one of my favorite books as of now.

B00A0ABQLM|5.0|With the demise of ethernet inputs in newer computers, I find this is very valuable especially in hotels that are wired but have weak wireless signals.  I also was impressed with the communications from Anker that accompanied the product--very professional, sincere and clear, giving me the sense they really wanted my business
193700788X|1.0|I honestly cannot believe that I am so distraught. I started reading the books six years ago when the tv show came out. I was a Bill lover in season one but after reading the first three books in one week it completely changed my perspective on everything and I was hooked. I honestly didn't care who Sookie ended up with. She was my Girl!! I believe that pretty much anyone and everyone who read every single one of the books just HAD to love Eric though. I mean, how couldn't you?? He was there through EVERYTHING!!!! I am just so upset how the series ended. I've read multiple reviews where fans have felt the same way I'm feeling right now, disappointed, angry, and just overall upset. After all the character development, the romance between Sookie and Eric...it just fell flat on its face. I mean my god. Sookie KILLED Eric's maker bc she loved him so much! And look at everything Eric has done for her through EVERY SINGLE one of the past books. For him to just leave...willingly.... and be petty about Sam??? That is NOT Eric!!! He is not a petty person, he's way too egotistical to be that!!<br />I am just so disappointed. And like everyone else says, do not buy the book it will just break your heart. :(
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I really enjoyed this most recent book in the Game of Thrones series.  If you have not read any of the book you will have to start with the first and you will be in for an awesome reading experience.
B009SSGBOE|5.0|If you are a true Steely Dan/Donald Fagen fan, then I am not going to bore you with some review detail. I simply think it's as great as all his other Solo's. Just give a listen to the track &#34;Weather in My Head&#34; and decide for yourself.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I too have been a Sookis Stackhouse fan from the very beginning. I have waited for each new book to come out every May. Have sat down and read each book in one sitting.<br /><br />Although I may not be happy with who Sookie ended up with in the end. I understand how this came to be.<br /><br />I would have given it 5 stars if Sookie had ended up with my favorite. But it's Charlaine's story and her right to end a story she created anyway she wants. I don't understand how people can be angry.<br /><br />Read the book for yourself.<br /><br />I was sad to see the characters I've come to care about end. Thank God For True Blood!<br /><br />Thanks Charlaine for a wonderful view into &#34;Sookieville&#34;

B002SR2PKG|5.0|Wow, just finished rereading this again after more than 25 years, so glad I did there was a lot I forgot. IT caught me and held on until the very end.
193700788X|4.0|It really is sad that this book has gotten so many bad reviews. I will admit that the series over the last few books were not what I would have wanted, but I was not surprised with this ending, because in all honesty, I think she deserved what she got so I was very happy. I wanted her to find her way and even though it wasn't the way I would have expected, so go Sookie!<br />I get so emotionally involved in the books that I read and have been known to throw my books across the room when I don't get my way lol. This was the author's story and how she wanted it to be so therefore, I loved the series, happy with ending and my hat's off to you Charlaine Harris for the amazing ride &lt;3
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|Although the writer did not dwell on the horrors of the orphanages, it was still just a bit too depressing for me.
B005D6O0IO|2.0|I really love the style, but they are not true to size.  Before I purchased, I looked at item online & zoomed in on the photos.  The bottom of the shoe on the picture clearly said &#34;Made in China&#34; which is the one I wanted because they seemed to be made more true to size.  But what I got was &#34;Made in Mexico&#34; and they are just too snug and not comfortable.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Once finished Dead Ever After and all I could think was how little Ms Harris must care for her fans. Not because of the way the book ended but how little effort she put in to the final book.  The final book basically seemed like she just pounded out this last one just to get the Sookie series over with. Congratulations Ms Harris you made your piles of cash and in the end made sure to give the finger to pretty much every fan that ever paid a penny for one of your books with how poorly you concluded the series. I'm so sorry I wasted my time and spent YEARS following this series.  It was such an utter let down. I wasn't unhappy with the resolution of the series I was unhappy with the quality of the book...crap.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is a pretty fun and addicting game. I think that it is great that it is free. It is also fairly clean. I do not think I have encountered any curse words or anything, which is excellent. May you find God's peace.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|The characters, each person's story, and especially the culture and scenery of India is absolutely mesmerizing. Wonderful acting.  I have watched it over and over.
B001AQQR2S|5.0|I choose this rating cuz you can tell from how many stars I put on it. but it was a good movie and did not mess up at all on amazon and I would recommend this movie to anyone.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I just finished the final book in the Sookie Stackhouse series &#60;sigh&#62;. If you're reading this review to get an idea how it all ends, sorry! Suffice it to say that Ms. Harris wrote a wonderfully fitting end to Sookie's story, and as always included endings for most of the others in Sookie's life. Several nail-biting moments, many moments of mirth and joy and yes, blood and mayhem, but a lovely tribute! You won't be disappointed, except that the journey has come to a conclusion &#60;another sigh&#62;.
B004HMQ7BI|5.0|I choose this rating cuz well I love this movie of course because it has Robert downy jr in it but who does not like him. I would recommend this movie to everyone who loves Robert downy Jr.

B009X01GJ2|5.0|Wow! This cover is everything that I could have dreamed of! I have purchased a number of holders and none of them seemed to be &#34;That One!&#34; It is tasteful in appearance and I love the 360 degree rotation. I guess the only thing more I could have asked for is that it came in patent red foe snake skin.  I would recommend this cover for anyone.

193700788X|2.0|****spoilers*****<br />I knew going into this last book that it wouldn't be a Sookie/Eric HEA. I could have even have been ok w a sam/sookie HEA if sam had been written as a character who seemed more than a Brother type in previous books. And, throughout this last book, he's not true to character at all. The book would have gotten on star from me, but i love the cover. I have followed this series from book one, and somewhere around book 7? It started going downhill, but i continued on....hoping it would get back in line with the expectations set in the first handful of books. I knew this last book wouldn't be what i wanted it to be, i just had hoped it would at least be a good read :/
B00A81MV3U|5.0|this movie does not have action, thriller nothing is a crazy romantic s ...t.. good dialogue, is the story of a bunch of crazy dudes, excellent dialogue...good for see with your wife, girlfriend, husband, boyfriend or f...g friend...this movie is s...t deep... grab your beer and enjoy, good for the family, no kids
0811875040|5.0|a great business deal and product. prompt delivery. the recipes are so very good, especially the hot milk cake. i cannot praise it enough. the book binding and pages are especially lovely.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I enjoyed it. I will read walking disaster but not as head over heals as some. Good book I would recommend it
193700788X|1.0|I have never seen an author break faith with her readers the way CH has done in this book.  I mean, who are the characters in this book?  I hardly recognize them any more.  What a lazy and disengenuous effort on the part of the author.  Sookie deserved better.  Eric deserved better.  Every character in the book deserved better.  CH's readers deserved better.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome! I want more! What a great twist to the story. The new characters and events make me ready to buy th  next book!
B00C2VGAW2|4.0|This is perhaps one of the best movie soundtracks I have heard in a very long time ... It reminds me of the classic 80s movie soundtracks like Footloose and Flashdance that produced several top ten singles some of which have become music  classics.<br /><br />Credit must be given to Jay-Z and Baz Luhrmann for getting some of today's best artists and in turn having them create new or cover versions of well-known songs to fit a 1920s themed movie.<br /><br />Get the Deluxe version for two reasons: firstly, for the orchestral version of Lana's \\"Young & Beautiful\\" which is undoubtedbly the best track on the album and is already drawing comparisions to Celine's \\"My heart will go On\\" - Titantic or Adele's \\"Skyfall\\" in terms of its effectiveness as a great musical score. And secondly for Sbtrakt's electro re-work of Florence's song \\"Over the Love.\\"<br /><br />Other songs that demand radio airplay and recognition come from Sia, Nero, XX, and Gotye.<br /><br />The only two tracks which I find as \\"weaker\\" are Beyonce and Andre 3000's rework of Back to Black that seems at times a conversation insttead of a song and Emeli Sande's cover of \\"Crazy in Love\\" - she hits the notes perfectly but the arrangement seems out of place...<br /><br />There is something here for fans of all music genres - dance, rock, pop and jazz.

193700788X|1.0|I usually don't read reviews because I like to form an opinion of my own. After stating that let me say that I am so disappointed. In this end I wanted to HEA, with someone. Instead we got an ok after all this I am a woman on my own. When I read I enjoy losing my self, not waiting for the other shoe to drop and read the same story I have already read. Some dies at Merlotts, she is accused, she did not do it. I was hoping Sookie would end up with Eric or Bill. This end left me wanting to return all her books back to her. I will never purchase another Charlaine Harris book. Not worth my hard earned money.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It kept my attention all the way through and I couldn't wait to start book two.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I didn't enjoy as much as the first book but it was good. Would still recommend it to read for fun.
193700788X|1.0|Yep, I have to say that this book sucked, I am angry and disappointed, this book bombed and in the worst way. I am not surprised that the author is hiding from the world right now. Even Amazon has cut the price for this book it should be much lower than it is listed. And its not a novel its a short story. I wouldn't even give it 1 star. Nope

B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love this game and im a kid so i think everyone should get this because its fun trying to collect the pets
193700788X|1.0|This book was s***. It read as if the author was rushed to get the product out there to the public with no regard for the previous stories or the fans. After reading 13 of these books you fall into a pattern. All of a sudden in the final book Charlaine Harris decides to change her writing style to POV (point of view). Only she doesn't do this gracefully and it appears disorganized and screws up the continuity. This is an expensive book, even the kindle edition and I would recommend people DO NOT waste your money. This was supposed to be an epic finale for the book series and to give the fans some closure on the characters they've read about for over a decade. #FAIL. Bottem line like I started this review, This book was S***!
B00CL68NOG|4.0|This movie serves as a reminder of Barbra's acting talent.  I recommend you watch her early movies like Funny Girl, What's Up Doc, etc.

0345803493|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was a lot better than the book one. Yes, Anastasia is still a nag but if you pay her no mind and focus on Christian then it is a pleasure to read. This book really had me turning the pages because of the suspense that was happening. Christian is a mystery and I can't wait to read book three to see what more I can learn about him.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|I've seen this movie a thousand times.  It's amazingly funny and great for just about any crowd.  A very quote-worthy movie too.
B009MYARIK|5.0|I loved Wedding Night!  It had everything that I love Kinsella's books.  Romance, wittiness,and a happy ending.  The characters are real and so darn crazy yet, believable.
193700788X|1.0|WTF?!<br /><br />I am so glad a friend of mine loaned me her hardcover so I didn't waste money buying this crap of a novel.  I will NEVER read a series by Harris again.  Good job alienating major portions of your fan base by totally making the majority of the books in the series pointless and completely morphing your main characters into totally different individuals....cause that always works out well for authors.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br />Eric got screwed over so royally that I'm just angry thinking about it. Plus, after all the angst and drama of getting Eric and Sookie together you bring Sam in out of left field for the ending?  Uh what the hell?  If that was truly the ending Harris felt needed to happen then the series needed to be written differently because this crap was pathetic.<br /><br />Don't waste your money or time reading this book.  The paper from the pages is more valuable as toilet paper. Way to crap on your fans, your characters and the series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a great game. Very addictive. My goddaughter loves playing and she's only 3. Great for people of all ages.
B00C2VIA52|3.0|Game is better a lot of ftp card games, and is actually fun. The question you have to ask yourself is if you want to spend 20 dollars for 12 cards three of them rare. Or spend 4 hours to collect enough in game currency for a single common. Decks are a minimum of 30 cards and the starting cards you get are basically only usable by the one of four races, which you choose at the beginning. So unless your going to spend a hundred or so hours per deck. Or a hundred or so dollars per deck, you might want to pass on this one.

0345803485|5.0|Wow.  I had heard all kinds of reviews about this book and after a while you just have to see what all the noise is about.  OK...now I know.  I have to say that if erotic romance is not your cup of tea you won't like this book.  I love romance books and a little erotica is nice too, but this has little different spin with its special brand of sex.  I really did like the story (sounds like when the guys say &#34;I only buy it for the articles&#34;) about Anna and Christian.  Anna is smart and strong regardless of some of the situations she finds herself in.  Christian is complicated and sexy and Anna finds herself torn between her love for him and his lifestyle.  I like that she isn't judgmental and is willing to look for ways to make it work for both of them.  E. L. James really writes some graphic sex scenes and it might be a bit much for some.  My friend and I talked about it and I was way more ok with these scenes than she was.  After all...it is just a story.  Of course I also read book two and three.  All in all...I think this is a good series and worth the read.

B00BEYYEE4|2.0|Exactly the type of film that is typically right in my wheelhouse, with 2 actors of whom I am a huge fan... Needless to say I had to see it.<br /><br />Now I am dumbfounded that it could have been THIS bad. Well it was... And if you have a couple of hours of your life that you want to throw away - then don't take my word for it and find out for yourself.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Frightening and captivating at the same time.  Scary to think there are minds that work that way.  Great read.  Wish there was a follow up.
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|Then you should thoroughly enjoy this film. Take it for what it is, an entertaining film with a decent plot that will keep you guessing, plenty of action, and a good cast who make for some interesting characters.<br /><br />Oscar-worthy or socially redeeming & thought provoking? Certainly not. But entertaining and a nice diversion for a couple of hours? Absolutely.<br /><br />And pretty original, which is tough to do these days.....
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I had to have my grandchildren teach me how to play the game. It is very interesting and all my grandchildren love to play it. So they said to give it five stars.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|So happy to see our Rod Man making music again ,just cant stop listening to \\"TIME\\" ,Love,Love,Love ,but than again all Rod's music is good .You get five stars for sure <3
193700788X|1.0|I will not be purchasing a C Harris book again. The Eric and Sookie relationship was built up slowly for most of thr books only to end abruptly with not much conversation between the 2. I skipped reading that whole section with her and Sam towards the end.  This book was boring and it just ruined the whole series.
B00C2VGAW2|1.0|Rap sucks in more ways than I can even describe. All rap sucks. Rap artists suck. Rap producers suck, and rap fans suck.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Finished book one yesterday and had to buy book two. Just finished it, and now I'm buying book three. I can't stop reading
B00AAQ7LP6|5.0|Love her performances. Didn't like the extra stuff in the middle, but at least i had a chioce to just play the live shows. Loved it.
B0076DELIG|3.0|Very straightforward with no real side story.....perhaps it's inevitable conclusion is what makes it an ok but forgettable read.  Connelly has done way better.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|I love sports dramas. They can be completely awful and I still find a way to like them. This, in my opinion, is far from awful. I think it shows how sports can bring people together in a variety of ways. Each person has their reason for relating to baseball/football etc. but when you look at it from another fans point of view you learn to appreciate the sport even more. Which is what happens between a gruff man, his long independent daughter, and a player turned columnist who's trying to accept his new life.
B00A8MGLAI|3.0|\\"Our lives are not our own. From womb to tomb, we are bound to others. Past and present. And by each crime and every kindness, we birth our future.\\" This is usually the part where I give a little synopsis of what the movie is about before I give my opinion. The problem with this one is that I don't think I'm smart enough to tell you what the movie is about, mainly because I'm not 100% sure. I do know it's about how the life of one person affects others throughout time, but after that I don't know what to say. I'm sure many will figure it out and think I'm dumb for not catching on though. As far as what I thought about it...to me there was just too much of everything. The movie is basically little vignettes of characters that are supposedly connected to the others but it jumps around so much its hard to follow. Most movies like this have one main plot line they follow and branch off of that...this one just put them all together and I had a hard time following. The other big distraction was the make-up. I do like the way they had the same actors in each section to show their point but the whole time I was thinking...I think that's Hugh Grant, or is that Agent Smith? It seemed to take me out of the movie. It may seem like I'm bashing this movie but the truth is I couldn't follow it enough to form a real opinion. I will admit that by the end I thought I was following it a little better but this is one I am not smart enough for. Overall, to me this is another movie where the writers and directors try to prove they are artsy and smarter then the audience...congratulations...you win. I give it a C+
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This was a great first book for the author. The poetry pieces were amazingly written and the concept of the characters connecting over art was refreshing for the teen romance/drama genre. The conflict plays out well between Will and Lake and you really get a feel for both of their perspectives without hating one or the other because they're being over dramatic about a situation or completely unreasonable. It's a very relateable story line about how life/careers/perspectives can get in the way sometimes, and how people must reevaluate their situations. Go with the life given to you, though it may not be the one you planned.
B000EZ7ZXQ|4.0|I had seen this before I was terribly injured in a skydiving crash but totally get it now. The lead character, Drew Barrymore has what is called retrograde amnesia. I have it, and it can be very tough. Watch the film and it is pretty accurate.
B004U8VWLE|5.0|Great film! This adaptation was an interesting contrast (...and comparison) to Swan Lake story and Portman was excellent. I think the inner portrayal of conflict was brilliantly done. It shows the turmoil that can arise from constantly pursuing perfection or reaching that top tier of a profession...which can relate back to many types of careers. In that sense it is a very relateable topic. It was difficult for me to picture Portman younger than she is. Although she certainly doesn't look older by any means, it was hard to see her as more of an adolescent in this movie. Sometimes you would forget this, and then see her in a pink room arguing with her mother, and then dancing the black swan as if shes well beyond her years. Overall great movie.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I really enjoyed World War Z.  It isn't playing at this and takes the subject pretty seriously.  That made it really easy to get into this world.  And that made the experience a lot of fun.<br /><br />I wanted to read this before seeing the movie, and now I have no idea how they're going to show this.  Still looking forward to it though!
0439023513|5.0|Had me on the edge of my seat from page 1...which is a rarity. Usually it takes me a few chapters to really get into (or back into) a book. Well written and layed out at a good pace.
B006LSZECO|3.0|So typically I read a narrative of books and make my own decisions to read or not to read, but I read this soley on the number of reviews which was huge.  I WISH I HAD READ THE REVIEWS.  I really, really had a hard time keeping with the story..it did have alot of turns and twists, but the end totally, totally dissappointed me.  I didn't care about the language or how it was written from the different views, but I hate to quit reading a book midway thru--this one again, disappointed.  Sorry
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I can watch this movie over and over and not get tired of it. And I have! I love Nicole and Ewan and think the story line is well played out. The music is great and fun to sing to (Especially trying to match Ewan's voice in Come What May). Overall, great classic movie that may take some getting used to at first (a little trippy) but it's worth it!
B0085YNML2|3.0|Was a free app from the Amazon Store for Android.  Only played the game for a little bit. Didn't really care for it.
B002G1K82Q|5.0|I usually don't like musicals...especially if I think they will wreck my view of the actors and/or band it portrays. But this movie is different and has landed in my top favorites! The cast is GREAT! And every single one of the absolutely nails the songs with their own touch (without completely changing the sounds of the songs by over doing them). Fuchs has an amazing voice and everyone should know that she has a band and music that is out from both before and after this movie. Sturgess  and Anderson surprised me with their vocals and do an excellent job. I love the overall story telling from the lyrics and it plays out perfectly. Highly recommend to Beatles fans, music fans, 60's fans, and even those people that don't like musicales (as I!).
B004DM0UII|3.0|I haven't really used this app.  Downloaded it because it was free. I have other apps that do the same thing but wanted to see if this was anything special. It wasn't.
B008PHN6F6|5.0|I've loved this movie since it first came out when I was barely old enough to understand it. Hah! While some call it cheesy, I've always thought the story behind it was of great entertainment. Yes, we all know that Jack could have fit on the board with Rose (as proven by Mythbusters ;) ) BUT, the way it plays out..as much as we hate for Leo to go... its really the only way to give the audience a feeling of great loss. You feel for the other passengers lost, but you connect with the romance behind Jack and Rose. Overall, classic Leo movie (and Kate) and I think their acting is well beyond their years in this.
B00005JL78|5.0|Minority report lots of action lots of twists and turns very happy to have in my collection arrived as advertised in excellent condition will be doing future business
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Shipped fast and price was great! Condition was used but it was still great condition with no scratches. Went through this season in a day or so non stop! Amazing to see how far the show has come since these initial non-connected stories.
B009R659L8|5.0|It is one of her best books  I didn't figure it out until the end  I am always wait for her next book
0439023521|5.0|Had me on the edge of my seat from page 1...which is a rarity. Usually it takes me a few chapters to really get into (or back into) a book. Well written and layed out at a good pace.
193700788X|5.0|After following the series for more than three years it's sad to say good bye. But I loved the ending.<br />I'm neither Team Bill nor Team Eric. I've always been Team Sookie. And maybe this is way I'm totally happy with this book and the ending of the series. I really loved Sookie and her voice in the whole serie and I'm happy to see she's happy in the end. I really understand her choice.<br />I've read a lot of comments and reviews from people who are totally disappointed with the ending of the series and I can understand why. It's not Eric, it's not Bill so both fan groups walk away disappointed.<br />But that Sookie won't end up with one of them is a long time coming. It's not just a developement of this book.<br />I like how a lot of stories are ended and resolved in this last book. I liked that we meet all these characters of former books again to say good bye.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Nothing more to be said that what has already been said. Great movie especially if you like an entertaining way to learn more about historic events in a pretty accurate way. The roles were played wonderfully and D-L is amazing as always! Sometimes these movies seem to change a lot of historic detail to conform with entertainment over accuracy and I did not notice that in this piece. Granted, I'm sure there were some discrepancies, but all in all a great film.
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|awesome game! was not expecting such a fun game. most action games do not have so many upgrades. lots of fun. great game for a buck.
0439023491|5.0|Had me on the edge of my seat from page 1...which is a rarity. Usually it takes me a few chapters to really get into (or back into) a book. Well written and layed out at a good pace.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I really enjoyed the earlier books in the series, but this book was lacking in substance.  I did not care who Sookie ended up with but the characters actions were off and it was not a satisfying read.
B009NY43NY|1.0|After years of LOVING this series, I feel like I've been kicked in the gut. I know the last few installments of the series have been pretty bad, but not horrible. I thought Sookie had lost some of her spark.. But was going to come back at the end and show us what she was made of, and why I fell in love with the series in the first place. Instead, I feel like she just decides to settle. I knew that things didn't look good for her and Eric, and although I was rooting for him, I kinda knew in the back of my mind that it wasn't going to happen. But I didn't think that Sookie would settle for someone who she kissed in the first few books and referred to it like kissing her brother. Hmmm.. Sounds like love to me.... I could have handled most of the suitors, because at least she seemed attracted to them in some way. But Charlene never even put Sam in the running. Sookie mostly just told us that he was a good friend and her boss. Actually, I could have handled a \\"I'm Sookie Stackhouse and I don't need a man\\" ending better than this, because truthfully I believe that is what the old<br />Sookie would have done, rather than settle for something. So it's over, and the ending sucks, and I have tons of money and time invested.., soooo... Guess you win this round, CH. However, I will never purchase another of your books again.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Great game, fun to play, challenging on my Kindle Fire, take with me on all my travels, love to play.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|i like how there is the dvd and blue ray in this set up.  It is a great musical.  The actors are actually singing while being filmed...not dubbed in later....realy amazing to realize how difficult of a job the actors had.  This package was a great deal and arrived fast.
B009JBZH54|5.0|La verdad sin palabras me encanta batman pero mucho mas desde que vio estos blu ray son impresionantes escuchar y ver al guason en hd y sonido 7.2 es impresionante. Gracias Christopher Nolan y gracias Heath Ledger
B00AKFG15S|3.0|I was so disappointed in this book. I felt the authors only interest was to finish it as it was the last of a trilogy. The ending felt that there was another book to come as it made no sense.
B002C4YYEU|4.0|This is a great movie. It's very interesting. But the length is daunting. It's hard to sit through. It's just so very long.
B005PZ857K|5.0|This was a good season for a great series.  On a side note, I contacted Amazon customer service when four of the season's episodes weren't subtitled, and they corrected the problem within a day.
B000K8EQ5W|4.0|I didn't like this movie, but it was very well done for what it is. I personally thought the premise was dumb. Maybe I didn't like it because I was expecting something else, I don't know. However, if you like romantic movies and don't think too hard about technicalities, this movie is probably five-star for you.
B005K17RU0|5.0|The app has very up to date info with recorded forecasts and I love the radar!! Would suggest this application to all my friends in the area.
B001B2CPH2|5.0|I highly recommend this movie to those of us who like romantic comedies. This is a modern classic that I'm sure will never truly die out.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I am enjoying this game and have discovered I'm willing to use funds for acorns on this one. I wish there was more opportunity to earn acorns<br /> though, it's discouraging and keeps me from playing more.
B007AFB868|5.0|I love all things Frida, for a movie of her life it's a nice one andI believe the only one. Salma is very energetic in capturing Fridas' emotions and feelings.
B0079R8IYW|5.0|Look nice in my kindle fire, I love the strap,looks very professional I love it, and you can watch your movies in bed it stands very firmly I love it
B003TSEEDY|2.0|The book is boring and I stopped after 30 pages. It makes me fall asleep.  Totally didn't like it .
B0097C8XL0|3.0|I have some words to say about this app RETARDED BUT ADDICTING!!!!!! You can't  change the tilt sensitivity but the updated version is better but still retarded
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Sanderson did a fantasitic job bringing this series to a close.  I've enjoyed each book as it became available and while I was a bit apprehensive when Robert Jordan died, this worked out really, really well
193700788X|1.0|I have read all the books and always enjoyed them.  Of course, I always like Eric, but I never expected for Sookie to be with him.  The Eric in this book wasn't similar to the Eric in the past books at all, and no one would believe he gave up what he had to be kept arm candy. CH must really hate her fans to write a book this awful.  All the past characters briefly showing up was just plain cheesy. She put Sookie right back where we found her at Merlotte's....with boring, unsexy, wimpy loser Sam.  This Soookie was half the girl that we all loved in the past books.  Literally, she could not have written a more terrible ending to this series is she tried.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was a super fun, beautifully designed game. I wish there were a second chapter already available. The puzzles were challenging, but not ridiculous, and the payoff for solving each segment was really satisfying.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is just sooooo..... awesome it's so fun I can barely stop playing it. My little brother likes the game and he's always begging to play.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Good read, now on to book 3! Kept me interested, now can't wait for the movie in November. Love it on the iPad
0439023521|5.0|Great futuristic fantasy. Peeta, the male main character is faced with the difficulty of choosing to die so the girl of his dreams survives,or let her die so he can live to see another day. Don't think it's all about him though Katniss is faced with making sacrifices herself. This book was amazing with twists at every turn, if you love a novel with action and romance this is the book for you!
B003F5WOEC|5.0|no other word to describe this album other than amazing. listening on cd is good, on vinyl is way better
B000F8O35U|4.0|The disc came as promised. The case was pristine and the discs play wonderfully. My kids love watching this movie and I'm glad I have a copy on DVD.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is totally awesome and fun, it's a simulation game to breed awesome different dragons. If you are wondering to get this game or not, totally get it!
B00005JKGK|5.0|I read the book in high school and later watched the movie and it follows the book nicely. The acting was good and the storyline is sentimental and touching.
0486278077|5.0|Oscar Wilde had a literary style to be loved and admired. I also like the fact that he caricatured important English nobility for some of the characters in his works. Beautifully written.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It's cool. It just doesn't update as fast as it should. Like the version that you have when your online is different from the app because there hasn't been a new update for the app. It isn't slow so I gave it 3 stars. It is better than the other facebook apps.....
B007IXWKUK|5.0|After reading the second book I am still a fan!  Now I am impatiently waiting to read the third book.  :)
193700788X|1.0|I'm a neutral reader. But I cannot believe how she ended things for Sookie and Eric. I always wanted her to end up as a strong independent women not having to give in to what society thinks are \\"accomplished\\" women. I was over the moon when I was able to connect with an author that was writing freely about how society really want women to get married and have children and live happily ever after. I was heartbroken when she crushed that in this book. And that came from her feeling she HAD to choose someone at the end.<br />Every damn book had \\"dead\\" in the title. So why would she just throw away all these amazingly funny vampires to the curb? I honestly don't like the ending, but not because of who she ends up with, but because it felt rushed and did not follow through with Sookies determination to keep Sam as her friend. She always hating having magic influence her feelings (Eric and the blood bond, etc.) so why is this so different? The CD changes her more than anything.<br />Eric was a character I enjoyed to read. After everything they've gone through, Niall claiming Eric really loved her, sookie taking him in when he was bewitched, saving him from the bomb, etc etc etc. There isn't really anything in the books that creates an arc for Sam and sookie.<br />Regardless, I think we can ALL agree, that Eric, a major character, more so than Sam for all the previous books, was given a brutally and cheap ending.<br />Harris, you could have ended him and Sookie on more satisfying and realistic terms. The fact that the only man who ever really protected Sookie and did things like re-pave her driveway for her, was absent from this book was really unjust as an author.<br />We deserve an ending where we can understand the choices.<br />Did Sookie really feel that nothing for him? She showed no heartbreak or anything.<br />Again, I'm a neutral reader, but with a story arc that has taken all the pages of pretty much all your books, you can't end it in 6 pages and expect us to becontent.<br />At least with Bill, there was a reason for their break-up and time to heal. Sookie still felt hurt a bit when she would see him. Not the case with Eric though? Did she love Bill more than him? Or just not at all?<br />This book was an unfair ending for all the characters, including Sam who was neglected from the entire series too, and most importantly, the fans.
B009NY43NY|5.0|The book was good and i really enjoyed it. It's sad that this will be the last book in the series.
B00000427L|5.0|These recordings made in 1970-71, have been basic staple recommendations in the catalogues since they were made. Since then they have reappeared in various forms but this latest remastered and budget priced version must now be the best version of these recordings yet.<br /><br />Ashkenazy and Previn clearly developed a mutually satisfying musical empathy in the 70's and this was particularly apparent in these concerto recordings and also the two-piano works such as the suites and Symphonic Dances.<br /><br />Both have also made notable recordings of the symphonies with the set by Ashkenazy being the more consistent and 'Russian' of the two. Ashkenazy first made his name as a Rachmaninov pianist with his recording of the third concerto with Fistoulari. That remains a very special disc. The later set with Haitink did not have the sparkle of the earlier recordings, reliable though it was.<br /><br />Since those days there have been many more fine complete sets of these concertos. Those by Lugansky and Andsnes stand out among the recent entries. I personally find them far more satisfying than the set by Hough, digitally spectacular as finger-work though those may be. I eventually passed them on to a friend of mine and have not regretted that.<br /><br />I would suggest that the set discussed here by Ashkenazy and Previn is a very hard act to match let alone beat and, as such, it certainly deserves to continue being listed as a main consideration for purchase. No one recording of such core repertoire can ever claim to be the 'best' or 'definitive' of course, but Ashkenazy's set with Previn can certainly claim to be one of the best to which I would add Lugansky and Andsnes plus several single concertos by other pianists who have had particular individual successes. The joys of collecting .....!
0062124293|1.0|This is a book chosen as a monthly read by my book club. I do not like the book at all. A lot of over the top description and crassness in the writing. Women don't have to act like men to write a best seller. There are much better subjects this author could be addressing in a much more interesting way. Better luck next try, she'll need it.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|If you are  able to get past the sex scenes and see the plot of the story, it isn't that bad. It can be monotonous but I enjoyed the storyline.
B001BKTEZA|3.0|I was required to read this book for my high school AP English class. This book was rather enjoyable to read until the end which was somewhat disturbing.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This novel has interesting, well developed characters and a charming ,heart wrenching  story line. It's about second chances. forgiveness and the meaning of family. A must read.
B001O1O71C|5.0|The Boy In the Striped Pajamas was a good book, but the \\"Fury“ and \\"Out-With\\" were confusing. I bet Bruno was sent to the gas chambers. Poor Shumel. And Bruno's family.
193700788X|5.0|As usual Charlaine Harris has done it again. I'll be sorry to see Snookie Stackhouse go!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We'll miss you Snookie!
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|My opinion give me my blocks lol thnks live ur game though its really fun to play even my three year old son likes and plays it ........
B009R659L8|4.0|Interesting story and fast paced plot. My only criticism may be that there were more characters than necessary so some of them were written fairly shallow.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Well first of the cop has a stunning outfit in the game and the dog has a awesome style. Second the game updates for you that's the best service you can ever expect.
0091939526|5.0|This is not your typical health and exercise book. This book is a great read and also a great reference guide. I like that i can pick and choose different chapters in the book and refer to them after i've read the book.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Extremely short, no new revelations, predictably happily ever after with Sam. This feels like a &#34;get it over with&#34; short story. Sorry that you are bored with Sookie, and sorry that you've gotten more of my money.
B000060O58|5.0|This version of the Brandenburg Concerto no.2 is the one that was chosen for the golden record in the Voyager spacecraft. Richter was a great musician and a great director. Is a shame that he died so young (he was only 55). I recommend this triple disc very much. It deserve 10 stars because this music is LITERALLY in the stars.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I love this game. Should probably give it 5 stars but I don't play a lot of games so there may be others that are better. Perfect while waiting at the dentist's, or between the time the girlfriend says and when she comes down the stairs.
B0065GC0PG|4.0|Cinder is a story about a teenaged cyborg who was an orphan until a man came along and adopted her. Shortly after her adoption the guy died and left Cinder under the care of his wife, who was not happy with having Cinder in the first place. She is not treated as a human but rather as a slave. However, unlike the Cinderella story that we've all come to know, there is more to this that meeting the prince and living happily every after.<br /><br />The spin on the classic Cinderella story is awesome. I don't generally find myself enjoying the retelling and I'm not a huge fan of dystopian either. So I was pretty shocked when I was instantly sucked into this futuristic world. Cinders world consists of androids, cyborgs, hover crafts, aliens and a deadly plague. The world that Marissa developed is solid and I loved that it takes place not in America but in China.<br /><br />I don't want to go into too many details and give things away because a lot happens in this story. However, I will say that Cinder is light on the romance and heavy on the dystopian. Granted, there is the prospect of romance between Prince Kai and Cinder but nothing actually develops there.<br /><br />My only complaint about this book was that I saw some grammar issues. Mainly words missing or in the wrong order. It was easily overlooked but I tend to take more notice in published books than in indie or self published books.<br /><br />Regardless of the little hiccups I found, I still really enjoyed Cinder. I liked how the author took a classic story and made it her own. There are some nods to the Cinderella story but don't expect the same outline or even ending. Cinder ends on a cliffhanger that will leave you clamoring for the next book in the series.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|So easy to create across platforms, devices.  I think it's awesome and I use it seamlessly across my phone, kindle, pc and mac.
B005T87QCI|4.0|All it did when I got the update was say now introducing the new robots then just load and load and load and never open the game
B00C2VGAW2|1.0|Haven't seen the movie but if these songs are part of it - this is one big strike against it.  Instead of creating a piece of art they are trying to go for the Bucks and attract more young people to this movie I guess.  With Redford's Gatsby, the music put you in the era - I don't think they played rap/hip hop during the 20's.  They should have included music that came from that time period or at least sounded like it.  Glad Nelson Riddle and F. Scott Fitzgerald are not alive to see what they did to this soundtrack.
1589944607|5.0|I want to start out this review saying that this is the best board game I have ever played. I've never seen a game make you so paranoid and unwilling to work with people unless you have to and it stay so fun. Players who are new to the game will be slightly overwhelmed with the seeming complexity of it but once you actually start playing you realize the game is deceptively simple. One of those easy to learn, impossible to master type things.<br />I won't go into the rules and the such because other reviewers have very well covered those but don't let it intimidate you because once you start playing the entire games goes smooth and is easy to get the grasp of. The game is also well balanced between humans and cylon so the entire game feels like a close run between the two to win.<br />One of the few reccomendations I make for people who are starting to play is that you go online and look up the expanded rules especially if you have questions about things the instructions don't cover which will happen fairly often. The instruction book is large at 32 pages long but doesn't cover ever specific situation. Luckily the manufacturers of the game have clarified most everything online.
B006H5120E|5.0|this has always been one of my favorite movies. i had been meaning to buy the dvd a couple years ago, so i was really happy to see there is a bluray out now. the 3d is anazing on this movie. it totally inmerses you into the story. i have seen this movie way too many times to be impressed with it anymore, but watching in 3d had me glued to the screen again. it's a must have for anyone's collection
193700788X|3.0|**Spoiler** Are you people blind or just stupid? She has been circling back around to thoughts of Sam throughout the series. It was inevitable no matter how much I wanted Eric. In the last 3 or 4 books Sookie keeps having baby urges. That told us she was not gonna end up with a Vamp, not to mention Eric has been so hot and cold throughout their relationship. And, of course the book is rushed. She had to finish up a dozen different character's stories and throw a little mystery in there to boot. I won't say it was my favorite of her books, but I think she did a damn fine job tying up loose ends in a logical way. Well, except for Claude. Man was I over him from the start. I didn't need to revisit the fairy community at all! All in all, I'm going with logical not outlandish conclusions win out over predictability. 3*** for leaving me not wondering about any character in the Sookie universe. Still a devoted fan!
B004G6009K|4.0|this was my first 3d bluray. i have seen the movie before so i was only purchasing to see the 3d aspect of it. we were enjoying it halfway through until it started skipping and freezing, then it just cuts to the next chapter. i am using a ps3 to view it and i even upated the firmware, but it still had the same problem. when i had opened the case (purchased brand new sealed), there were already some marks on the bottom of both bluray discs. i have to return for a refund and buy it again. all i can say is disney needs better control because i have seen people complaining about defective discs on other disney bluray releases. so please check your discs all the way through after purchasing. i've never had this kind of problem with any other discs before even if they weren't spotless on the bottom.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is a great way to pass the time. We play it all the time. It is fun to play while trying to relax.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game..it's very addicting..I wait every day for my daily bonus credits so I can play again.I would recommend this game to anyone that loves bingo
1439170916|5.0|I found this book absolutely fascinating. Heavy on medical history, research and cases. But, still an easy read. You will know more than you expected about cancer by the end.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|This book is good, but it is deep.  It is good for challenging your reading comprehension skills.  The author does a nice job of explaining how habits form and how we can change them.  You won't come away with a short checklist that will change your life, but if you are committed to changing, this book will help.
B002V6RB1C|5.0|Always a good watch<br />Love how the plot develops and the rest of the cast all play there personal role<br />The ending is fantastic real COOL
B004UHL9EK|4.0|Pretty much does everything when it comes to timers. I love the nap time setting.  The only thing I would add is a custom snooze for each alarm.
0345803485|3.0|An erotica story about a love affair between Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele, it was a good read and, perhaps, it would make an interesting psychological study.  I found it entertaining. The protagonist, Christian,  was expertly portrayed as a control freak who totally dominated  Anastasia. The ending, in my opinion, was a stand up and clap for Anastasia. Promotion of the book was effective and a bit overdone but none-the-less it was more enjoyable than eyeballing the TV. It's an okay adult read.
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|The Woman in Black is a wonderful film, artfully and eerily done, with a great cast.<br /><br />Daniel Radcliffe's performance was top rate and has no relation to his Harry Potter character.<br /><br />I also loved the performances of Ciaran Hinds and Janet McTeer, who plays his wife.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed with this movie.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Cheryl Strayed is an excellent storyteller. I found myself caught up in her story from the start. Couldn't put the book down, wanted to find out what happened next.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|I loved this documentary! I felt like it presented the facts without being biased or pushing one viewpoint. I love the concept behind the film of respect life, both human and animal. I think this is a must see for everyone. You will not be dissappointed.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Okay, there are MANY full reviews so I will not spend any more time than necessary to help other readers make an educated decision about spending the money to buy this book.<br /><br />We would have all been better off if we stopped reading the series at book 10 and made up our own ending to the series.  All of the other reviews I have read are accurate if they are talking about how the story died. I am not at all sure I believe that the the person that wrote the last thee books is the same as the author who wrote the first 10. Clearly, there was no real interest in keeping up the original story line and this wrap up book was lacking in any authenticity to the original characters and had almost no emotion at all. Well unless you view Eric's leaving as anything but painful and totally lame. I would like to point out that another book is coming in October, a book that is supposed to tie up loose ends. What?  Why do we need another book to do that when this book could have accomplished everything necessary???  Hhhmmmm.... I smell a money maker attempt so beware.  Just sayin!
0061950726|4.0|This book introduced me to the concept of Orphan Trains in early 1900s.  Well-intentioned idea to move NYC orphans west, and adopt them out to new homes in elsewhere is the US to save them from a life on the streets.  However, its execution was flawed in that often people's motivations to adopt were not honorable. Equally, many who adopted were ill suited parents.  As this book shows, several parallels with current day foster system.<br /><br />In addition to the plot, the pacing of the story was even - not too fast or slow, the characters were interesting.  Liked the parallels between two main characters. I'm intrigued by the history of Orphan Trains and intend to learn more about them.  Meanwhile, I recommend this book to folks interested in historical fiction.
B000F8O35U|1.0|The first dvd we received would freeze at the same spot every time, we used different dvd players to make sure it was the dvd. We emailed the company and they graciously sent us another one, unfortunately this one freezes also. We have tried to email the company several times and they wont respond. Very unhappy.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It took me 10 minutes to become addicted to this series!  I can't wait for the new season to begin.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I have been looking ALL over for a cover that looks like a book under $50. This exact case was $45 at my local Wal-Mart. I was thrilled to see it for much less on here. I have a Nook Tablet and I was worried that it wouldn't fit once it got here. It took a minute  to get it in there but it fits perfectly! When I first put the case on the strap pushed on the power button and turned it off, but once I got it situated it wasn't an issue.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|my grandson loves these birds so I got it for him and he plays it a lot. a go for him
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is great!!! I love playing solitaire on my iphone and kindle fire!! I don't enjoy the ads but they aren't bad.
B00A7YZ1KI|3.0|I am sad at the way Eric was portrayed in this book. I am not surprised that Sookie ended up with Sam as she never wanted to be a vampire. I just think the break up could have been handled better. If Eric spoke to Sookie and told her they do not have a choice, that he loved her as a human but had to follow vampire politics, it would have been better. Eric was built up through the series. We all loved him. To suddenly portray him as this jerk that only cares about himself is unfair to all the fans of this series. Also feel Pam's friendship with Sookie was a severe let-down. AS she interfered in the other books surely as a friend she should have had sympathy? She could have explained why Eric and the other vampires behaved the way they did. The vamps were built up in all the books. Suddenly in the last book they are shown as insensitive jerks that only care for themselves. I will just have to create my own version of the ending in my mind. Will keep Sookie with Sam but Eric and the vampires would be treated a lot better!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|At the start it's a little slow, especially with that extra download but afterward it's a fast paced game with good graphics and challenges.
B00CA9Y6Q8|5.0|Please buy this album!  If you like being the kind of person who finds something special and significant before anyone else, then Laura Mvula is for you.  I feel like I have been waiting for her.. this.  Her influences are Lauren, Jill, and Erykah; and she (a brit) came up with this master piece (definitely giving her influences a run for their money)... I am truly blown away.  PS, I have never written a review here, and I buy at least two albums a week for several years.  This album made me write these words.. Please enjoy.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This is a amazing book about a boy who was a no one and becomes a cool cat!! I loved it
B0063IH60K|4.0|great for a travel or just relaxing especially since the internet does not have to be on and it saves the game until later.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|My husband and I saw Les Mis in the theater and<br />were astounded. It's a must see especially if you enjoy musicals.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I and my husband like to play games when traveling, this is great especially since I do not need to be on line.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I was a bit discouraged at the beginning when it seemed like Sookie was all alone with her problems. She had depended so much on the vampires. I was glad to see some of the characters of the other books come to Sookies' aid. I think the last book definitely lead into this book & the conclusion.<br />SPOILER** There is no way that Sookie could have ended up with Eric  and still have remained human, which she wanted to do. I liked how one reviewer pointed out that Eric was a product of his times-marrying for wealth or political motivation. I do think Sookie has grown through the series. She knows herself much better, not so naive. Sookie also knows what is important at the end of the day, so the friends coming around proved that to her.<br />I was happy with the book-not the greatest in the series but it made sense.
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|I am always needing a dictionary for when I read library books and now I have a great one. It's easy and convenient.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I played the original on Facebook for a long time. Wish I could port that profile over, but the gameplay is even faster now.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a fantastic book. Thoroughly good read!!!!!!<br />Will be looking forward to the next book.<br />This is the best book , I've read in a while.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|I have been a Rod Stewart fan for a very long time and have most of his albums. I have also seen him in concert at least ten times and I must say, he never disappoints.  He is a fantastic singer and performer. I also read his great autobiography when it came out and loved it because it was so real and funny as well as very moving..  Still, I didnt know what to expect when I heard that his newest album, \\"Time\\", was coming out, featuring all new songs that Rod either wrote himself, or co-wrote with others . I even stood in line yesterday to buy it, and rushed home to play it last night. Well, the bottom line is that the album is just wonderful, the very best I have heard from Rod in years. My boyfriend and I played it  three times and every time we heard it, we loved it more.  This morning it is playing for the fourth time as I write this review. The songs are fantastic, and Rod's raspy, simply fabulous voice has lost nothing with the years.  In fact, I think he just gets better and better. I would suggest that everyone who reads these words rush out today to buy it, or download it if that works for you. And don't forget Mothers Day. I don't think there is a mother in the world who wouldnt be thrilled to receive \\"Time\\" as a gift this Sunday. Thank you, Rod, for another thrilling musical experience.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Flight mechanics are good, pretty simple controls.  They nailed Tonya humor too which is a plus. A must have for any Iron man fan.
B00AW28HF6|5.0|Tsunami Connection is a well written, compelling thriller that draws you into the narrative right from the start. The fascinating 'black ops' world of spies and covert operations is covered convincingly in this international thriller. If you like fast paced action, adventure and intrigue you will love this book.
B009NY43NY|1.0|To say I have been a fan of this series in an understatement. I have every Sookie novel, anthology, short story and Sookieverse book published... hardcovers and first editions if they were available. I marked my calander, pre-ordered and counted the days until each and every one was available for purchase. I don't regret purchasing any of the books previously, though I do think I was cheated a bit in this last work.<br /><br />I knew I was going to be disappointed that this beloved series was coming to an end, I just never thought it would be this type of disappointment. I am having difficulty even associating this book with the rest of the series. I am heart sore for Eric.<br /><br />While I want to thank Mrs. Harris for creating such a wonderful fantasy world in which I could immerse myself in, I am deeply saddened in the way she ended the entire affair.<br /><br />I have read and re-read many of the earlier books, but I don't think I will turn the pages of this last work again.<br /><br />Is it too late for a re-write?
193700788X|1.0|It has all been said. Just awful. If I could give zero stars or even negative stars I would. Never again will you draw me into a series Ms. Harris.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Swift key is a very nice and customizable keyboard. I don't always like the flow feature but the predictive words are a big time saver. I always try new keyboards and I always come back to SwiftKey.
193700788X|1.0|This book makes Breaking Dawn look like an award winning novel. And that is saying something. It's like Harris is mocking the fans with this. does she honestly not know what is was we wanted? F- 0/10 would not buy.
B009T8XBBO|3.0|This is a Good Adventure game that has you Collecting Resources and Building things with them.  It is nicely designed with Good Graphics and Smooth progression.  The Music is Soothing and the Sound Effects are Real and blend nicely with the given tasks.  There are options to adjust or mute all sounds.  The main challenge is to Reconstruct Tornado Damage, Rebuild Bridges, Clear Roads, Build Cottage with collected Wood, etc.  For each level completed, your Reward Castle is built up progressively.  This is all TIMED so you have to plan and execute tasks Quickly or you have to start level all over again.  This all works very well and is Challenging, Entertaining and Satisfying Fun to make progress.<br /><br />The Challenges are good and keep your Brain busy with planning and strategy to get higher scores.<br />The Story Line is simple:  Repair damage, Build a Route, Save a Princess, Fight a Dragon, etc.<br /><br />Sadly, the loading of each level is somewhat SLOW.  Most of the Play is very REPETITIOUS and becomes a little tedious.  Also, the Material Icons are TINY and hard to see clearly.  Like most NEVOSOFT games, it gets old after awhile making the Replay Value dissipate.  It is good but could be better if they added a little Excitement and Reduce the Tedious Repetition of identical tasks.<br /><br />OVERALL:  A nice game but somewhat slow and tedious so the Fun Factor wares off early.  The In APP PURCHASING is a Negative considering it is a $4.00 PAID app.  Therefore I deduct 2 Stars.
1892005034|4.0|I wish I had read this book a long time ago.  \\"Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life\\" by Marshall B. Rosenberg, Ph.D. is full of wisdom.<br /><br />The book starts off by explaining the process of Nonviolent Communication which boils down to four steps:<br /><br />1. Observe what's happening - what's really going on?  What is happening or being said that you either like or dislike?<br />2. Identify your feelings about it - anger, joy, hopeful, inspired, lonely?<br />3. Figure out what need you have that is driving that feeling<br />4. Ask for what you need (explicitly)<br /><br />When you feel an emotional response to a situation, Rosenberg contends that it's always based on some unmet need.  So figure out what that need is and then request (don't demand) for the other person to fulfill it.  Use phrases like:<br /><br />\\"Would you be willing to set the table?\\" rather than \\"Set the table.\\"<br /><br />So, that's the process of non-violent communication in a nutshell.  He then goes on to talk about \\"communication that blocks compassion,\\" such as moralistic judgements, making comparisons, communication that implies that we do not have responsibility for our own \\"thoughts, feels and actions,\\" and communicating desires in the form of demands.<br /><br />The next several chapters delve further into each step of the process.  Using great examples from his own workshops and personal experiences, Rosenberg presents each step in a thoughtful and straightforward way with exercises at the end of each chapter to test your understanding of the subject matter.<br /><br />The book then goes on to explain how to receive communication in an empathic way, which is based on those same principals, but now, your honestly trying to get to the bottom of the other person's needs to find out how you might be able to help fulfill them.  He describes different ways that we prevent ourselves from being fully present for someone including: advising, one-upping, educating  consoling, story-telling, shutting down, sympathizing, interrogating, explaining and correcting. And, the many benefits of empathy.<br />Rosenberg refers to all of this compassion and need-filling as finding ways to \\"enrich our lives or the lives of others.\\" I love that.  When you approach every communication with that question, \\"how can I enrich my life or theirs?\\" it's amazing how differently you think about approaching a situation!<br /><br />He says that \\"NVC's most important use may be in developing self-compassion.\\" One way in which we do this is to recognize that we always have choice.  Even if it feels like we don't - we do.  There might be ramifications for not doing something that you feel you have no choice in, but you still choose to do it.  And, once you realize that there's a choice and WHY you are choosing to do what you are doing, you may actually be able to find a better way - one that makes you happier.<br /><br />One of the most important chapters in the book has to do with expressing anger.  Rosenberg says that NVC doesn't suggest that you can't be angry about anything.  Quite the opposite.  If you're experiencing anger, you need to fully express it.  However, you need to accurately identify the cause of your anger, which is always your own thinking - not someone else's actions.  Their actions might have been the catalyst, but the emotion is your own. Then, you basically use the same four steps to work through your anger and attempt to get your needs met.<br /><br />For me, an HR Lady, one of the most interesting chapters was \\"Expressing Appreciation in Nonviolent Communication.\\" I've always felt like reward and recognition programs including praise and compliments in most workplaces don't usually provide the intended behavior changes. Now, I think I understand why - the intention behind these practices.  Rosenberg states, \\"recipients of such praise do work harder, but only initially.  Once they sense the manipulation behind the appreciation, their productivity drops.  What is most disturbing for me, however, is that the beauty of appreciation is spoiled when people begin to notice the lurking entent to get something out of them.\\" From my experience, I believe this is true. So, how do we provide meaningful appreciation?  Rosenberg lays out three components:<br /><br />1. \\"the actions that have contributed to our well-being.\\"<br />2. \\"the particular needs of ours that have been fulfilled.\\"<br />3. \\"the pleasureful feelings engendered by the fulfillment of those needs.\\"<br /><br />If the appreciation is delivered succinctly with all 3 of these components, then the receiver will be much more likely to realize that the appreciation is genuine.<br /><br />Like I said in the beginning, I wish I had read this book a long time ago.  I gained a lot of insight from this book and will definitely be doing more research and reading on nonviolent communication.  I think I might order the workbook next.<br /><br />I started this book yesterday morning and finished the last chapter of it this morning, so it's also a quick and easy read. I give it four stars out of five, only because some of the ways that he states certain questions when trying to take regular communication to the NVC process just do not sound real. I can't imagine someone saying some of the statements that he says we should use in real life and some of the things that he claims to have said to people actually sound pretty harsh to me.  Perhaps they did get at the heart of an issue or reveal a \\"truth\\" but I'm not sure about the exact means used to get there.  Overall a GREAT book!rops.

B000FC1192|5.0|I read this book a few years back,I loved it and decided to read it again.It was just as good,if not better,the second time. It's creepy enough to make you think and grab your attention, but not enough to leave a child scarred.I do not recommend it to any kid under the age of 10,though.
B009R659L8|4.0|As she always does, Marty Higgins Clark has delivered her newest thriller that keeps you mystified until the very end even while furnishing you with every necessary clue to solve the mystery.
B009NY43NY|1.0|My original review was deleted for being \\"spiteful\\". It is obvious that Harris's group is under full damage control mode after this, so that does not surprise me. I am not going to bother re-writing all of the faults of the book, because they have been covered so eloquently by other reviewers. I cannot really add much to all of this except that I was sorely dissapointed, and that I feel disrespected by Harris. I just wanted to come back and make sure my one star was counted amongst the many.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is great for any fan of iron man. You get to fly around as Tony stark and save the world. I wish however the game would add a little more storyline to it but besides that, great game.
193700788X|1.0|What a sad excuse for a book... and an author.  The series started off amazing, but the author clearly got full of herself.  Emboldened by a sense of entitlement due to her success, she decided she could write crap for the last several books while she thumbed her nose at the readers by creating a ridiculous ending that went against everything the previous books suggested. If she didn't care about the ending (which she clearly did not) she could have at least given her readers what they wanted as a thank you for their support.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Thought-provoking and insightful... A book for women or men who are trying to balance any mixture of work and family. Worth the time and money.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is actually really hard compared to what it looks like and plus I really like it is because this game gets up dates which makes it even nicer with different cities
B0058YPILY|3.0|Packaging/ housing of the discs in good shape. However there wasnts a single disc that didn't skip on mulitple episodes. That pretty much sucks
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|This guy is talented...TOTALLY!  His first cd was what I called THE HAPPIEST CD ON THE PLANET.  Now with this release, he let go some of the happy, but made a mark on music.  Yes, it did have vulgarity, but, just like my novels, I can overlook some things and keep it moving.  Each song was a Bruno hit, number 4, TREASURE, being my favorite!  I will admit, tracks 1 & 3 took me getting used to, especially track 3, GORILLA.  I mean that line, \\"MAKE LOVE LIKE A GORILLA\\"?  REALLY?  Bruno, you know how to come outta your bag.  After 3 spins, they totally grew on me.  This was a very good cd and I totally enjoyed it, from beginning to end.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great read for everyone, don't have any thing else to say highly recommended smooth read goes to fast can't wait for more from this author
B00AFOS6QG|5.0|The CD is amazing if you enjoy the mellow side of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. For those who like their more raucous offerings, this will not be a favorite CD. The lyrics show Nick's love of words; there is some interesting (and entertaining!) imagery. It included a free mp3 download, which I immediately put to use. The book heralds back to a day when publishers took time and care with their products. The binding is woven cloth (like the good old days). The pages are thick paper and show mark-ups and changes on the lyric sheets. The photographs make a good product better. I have not watched the DVD, but imagine it is just as entertaining and high-quality as the rest of the package.

B00913P6G0|5.0|This album is one of the most notable in recent memory for me. Kendrick Lamar represents a very unique style of rap that I haven't seen done in quite a long while. Kendrick has begun to enjoy mainstream success, and it's fantastic to see. This album is everything you could want from an artist like Kendrick Lamar.<br /><br />Good Kid, m.A.A.d City paints a picture of Kendrick's life growing up in Compton. Production on this album is top-notch with many standout tracks. Perhaps my favorite on this album is \\"Swimming Pools (Drank)\\". The lyrics are top-notch, his flow is on point, and the chorus is perhaps one of the most memorable of 2012. Kendrick even manages a section of the song with his conscience speaking - an idea many rappers have used, but he pulls if off without sounding derivative of other rappers' efforts.<br /><br />\\"Poetic Justice\\" has a quality feature from Drake, and a simple, elegant beat. It's a strong track, and it is one of the album's most accessible for those who may be unfamiliar with Kendrick's style.<br /><br />\\"Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst\\" is a daring endeavor that Kendrick pulls off perfectly. The track comes in at over twelve minutes long. It's a medley of sorts, and it is a fantastic musical experience. Kendrick keeps the song interesting throughout the entire run, and he doesn't lose his flow or momentum. This is something that really shows off Kendrick Lamar as an artist, and it affirms his skills as a hip hop performer.<br /><br />There are those out there that argue that rap is dying. They say every rapper today sounds exactly the same, and that rap is doomed to corny punchlines, misogynistic and violent lyrics, and loud bashing beats. Kendrick Lamar proves that rap still has its energy. There is much more music to be made for years upon years to come, and the genre is still very well alive. Creative artists will continue to further the genre.<br /><br />Kendrick Lamar's Good Kid, m.A.A.d City is certainly worth the purchase forany rap fan looking for something (and someone) new. It is undeniably one of the top albums of 2012.
0142000671|5.0|This book was truly amazing and touching. You will fall in love with Lennie and George. They have a nice friendship. George always looking out for Lennie, no matter how much trouble Lennie got in. Everybody needs to read this book, its simply wonderful.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|I got this to replace the stock AMD FX-8120 cooler that came with my CPU.  The original cooler had a high-pitched tone while running at full pitch that got on my nerves and concerned me as it seemed my cooler was running at capacity most of the time.  This cooler installed easily, and immediately achieved the desired effect of quietly cooling my CPU well beyond the capability of the stock cooler.

193700788X|1.0|If you read this book and stop before the last few chapters and make the rest up in your head, it's quite ok, maybe 3stars of a fluffy visit to Sookieville, but definitely not a fitting ending for such a nice series.<br /><br />The ending, ugggggg.  Beyond disappointing.<br /><br />To sum it up, if you're an Eric and Sookie fan, you're going to be angry and disappointed.  If you're a Sookie fan, you're going to be disappointed and in disbelief of what a coward Sookie turned into with regard to her love life.  If you're a Sam fan, rejoice!  The boring / safe guy got the girl.<br /><br />It would've been more interesting if she wound up alone, at least there would've been hope!
B004ZA9HB4|3.0|I cant give this game a review as I have not played this game. When I do play it I will do a review.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|OMG I was almost done. I had one more to go. The I walked a little farther than I turned and there Slendy was. I was like 0.0 and I was so scared but it the coolest scary game I have ever played. And its Sooooo fun!!!!!!!!!!! I didn't know that that Slendy had those tentacles. IF THERE WERE MORE THAN 5 STARS, I WOULD RQTE AS HIGH AS I COULD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B009O2XY12|3.0|It is fun to pop the bubbles. After a while I get bored. I like more interesting games. This is more for kids under 15.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|If you had a computer in the 90's and no internet connection, you already know all about this game. This is pretty much the exact windows version, except it isn't on a 50 billion pound non-portable computer and monitor. This is the classic pinball that we all know and love!
B000FA675C|5.0|Intriguing novel. Completely enjoyed reading, immersing myself into the story. Bold in putting forth some of the facts and interested me to now try and more historical info on the grail legacy.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|This is one of the best movies we've seen. I just purchased a copy so as to be able to watch it whenever we want! We loved it the first time we watched it but found that after watching it the second time the other night we got so much more out of it and understood things we missed. That is one thing to keep in mind, watch for little things that are said and it will clear up some confusion at the end. This is a movie that has you laughing one minute, and feeling heavy another. It is good in that it keeps your emotions constantly going, not being straight comedy or emotionally gripping which I think is a very good thing. I can't recommend it enough and do suggest that if it is not totally clear the first time, watch it again.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|A lot of movies go over the top with the action. Most was believable in this movie which made it a great movie to watch.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a badass game its soo addicting but fun to play!  Its a good ass  game:) soooo if i were you i would get it(:
6305922756|1.0|This product will not play without skipping. I'm using a perfectly good, Region 1 DVD player that I've used for years and years. I returned this product for a replacement, and was given a disk in the same condition. It's not worth playing games with Amazon trying to get a working disk. Very sad for a Spinal Tap movie fan! Would give zero stars for wasting my time, twice.
B000X418UO|5.0|I am entertained and can revisit this Blu Ray production repeatedly, and will do so. Video and Sound are up to the Blu-ray standard and show off my HT to my delight!!! Will recommend.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A well written page turner.  Can't wait for sequels.  A fun read for anyone who likes science fiction novels.  Cheers
B000NU2CY4|5.0|This Blu Ray with the video and audio quality deserves to be in any videophiles collection. The story is well paced and engrossing. It brings out the best in my equipment, which also makes me smile.
193700788X|1.0|The author spent more time describing the food Sookie was eating and the way her garden was growing than she did creating emotional scenes between Sookie and Eric. I was never a Sookie/Eric shipper, but a relationship that was built up over so many books deserved a better fleshed-out ending, if not a better ending altogether. I've been a fan of the series from the beginning, but this book was a disappointment.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's free, can't beat that. Fun game for kids too. My roommate's kid plays it all the time. Slightly jittery sometimes but not game-breaking.
B00BI6SSMC|4.0|Is this new album \\"poppy\\"?  Yes.<br />Is it a departure from the earlier stuff?  Yes.<br />Is it a bad album?  No.<br />Is it better than the last album, Kiss Each Other Clean?  Yes.<br /><br />I really only liked two songs on the last album; I have about 4 on the current album that I love, and others are getting me interested.<br /><br />I'm ambivalent about Iron and Wine's new direction, and I do prefer the older albums overall.  But this is not bad!
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|fun game. nice and moody. way too short. still really fun. one recommendation to the developer: make it longer please.
1423140605|5.0|A fan of Percy, my sister also finds these books loaded with humor in the right places and this one will be right up there.  Keeps your attention page after page until the end then you hunger for more.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I like this book a lot you get to see Greg and Rowley grow up a lot and lots and I mean lots of laughs
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addicting. I love playing it on down time. It is a lot of fun. Recommend it to all.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Omg my 7 year old girl is so happy I got this game. Her face is always in this game. I give a five star.
B00867GJYK|5.0|This is a fun movie. We love watching it as a family, and we are thrilled they are making a second one.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I'm more than a little bit unstable, so when my GF bought this game, I pretty much kidnapped her Kindle and spent the weekend killing off humanity- over and over.<br /><br />Now I have my own Kindle and a copy for myself.  I found that I didn't have as much incentive to play once I'd unlocked everything.  I've only scorched the earth a few times on my own game. But I do play it once in a while.<br /><br />There is a lot more fun that you would think to be had in the few simple screens this game provides.  You can begin your plague in different countries to see how their climate and other factors affect the spread. You can make it better or worse in a variety of different ways to try to coax it to work differently to affect countries that are resistant to the effects.  You also have to stay on top of reducing the efficacy of cure research. It's a lot to juggle and you spend much of your game time actively participating in the game- until it all falls apart, then you can just watch the world go red. You can also lose- fail to infect every country or have the infection cured before it can spread.<br /><br />Updates to the game to change the popup news stories would be nice, it gets a bit tiring to read the same funny things over and over since they're only funny once. I never had any issues with crashing or lagging. This game was so well done I went to get the rest of the company's games, only to find that aside from an expansion pack for this one, there aren't any yet. Sigh. They should make one about curing diseases or something so I can balance my karma for all these plagues.
B001NEXEEG|4.0|Two of my favorite stars (Stewart and Wayne of course) - their contrasting styles make for a great Western tale. And the movie is topped off with sort of a twist of an ending. Very enjoyable.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I got this one for my kindle and it works so well! And the most important thing is that it is free!
B001EBYM62|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. The sing and dance is spectacular. And I could get &#34;Singin' in the Rain&#34; stuck in my head for days. The only thing that can cure it is watching this movie again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is the best game every and more people should get it and they should make more.<br />This better than temple run 1 and 2
B008EEBBIY|4.0|No one can accuse Family of the Year of breaking new musical ground -- no, they seem quite content churning over well-plowed earth.  There's certainly nothing wrong with that, particularly because they do so to rather good effect on Loma Vista.  I downloaded the album after hearing &#34;Hero&#34; on local alternative radio -- enchanted by the plucky guitar and the humble, immensely refreshing anti-self-aggrandizing theme.  Ah, so nice to see that the wisdom of &#34;Less is More&#34; is beginning to permeate the airwaves!  Throughout the album, you can hear influences ranging from the Beach Boys to Simon & Garfunkel to Nada Surf to Plain White T's and perhaps just a little mid-career R.E.M. (minus the politics).  Plumbing the eternal themes of romance, distance, family, and comfort lost and found, you might call this &#34;the&#34; (or perhaps &#34;a&#34;) quintessential college album.<br /><br />&#34;I don't wanna be a big man...&#34;  Amen, my friends!
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|It was a good book overall.  It kind of got a little boring when it kept changing the point of view
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is a really fun game.  It's surprisingly addictive!  The characters are cute and fun to watch. I'm glad I tried it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think that minecraft  P.E. is a very good app. I have the PC version myself. But I think that pe is a good game and mojang has done very very good on this game. And if you think that minecraft pe is going to be as good as the PC version than think again. Because it's not. It's already as good as it can be. I mean in the 0.6.0 update they've added armour,signs,leather. What else can they add? Good job mojang.
B006VZS1EA|5.0|My son and I (hes 7) enjoy watching this movie together. We have watched it more then once. Im glad I purchased it for download so we can watch it anywhere and it wont get scratched.
193700788X|5.0|The last book of the Sookie Stackhouse Series was engrossing and I was not able to put it down. I do not understand the negative comments about the outcome of this series and find it quite appalling that anybody would show such criticism to an author, who quite frankly can write whatever she wants. I enjoyed the series as a whole and i loved the ending and feel that it ended exactly where it needed to, in a happy way. I was very happy with this story and will miss Sookie, but will go back and enjoy her story time and time again. Great work Charlaine Harris!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I love cut the rope time travel. It keeps getting better and better. I deffenitly recomend this to someone else.
B0071NOU78|5.0|Incredible product: Sounds and colors are perfects. Its a outstanding toy, the best gift for a child who loves starwars.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|my son had told me how great this movie was and that Daniel day Lewis made a great Lincoln. I agree. I really enjoyed this movie very much.
B00B5P37IG|1.0|Not 1 channel I would watch, when you can even get 1 to come in or on. Honestly,I cannot even give it 1 star. Misleading title for the app for sure.
B008OLO7ME|5.0|I love this bag although it really is just for your computer, cords, a notebook and a few odds and ends. You still need a purse for other essentials. That said, it looks great, protects my mac book and I have had many compliments.
B003DZX44I|5.0|Although I've always really liked this movie I have to say what really sold me on the Disney Diamond Editions was the bonus material.  This product has a 2nd blu-ray disk just for bonus material.  One of the titles was \\"Composing a Classic.\\"  It is a remarkable and heart-felt tribute to Howard Ashman by Alan Menken.  It took me back to those dark days of the AIDS epidemic.  Recently I saw another tribute, by Brian May for Freddie Mercury, in [[ASIN:B006GH6IS4 Queen: Days Of Our Lives [Blu-ray]]].  Both Howard Ashman and Freddie Mercury worked to the very end.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|It's a fun game that my grandsons like to play. The down side is it only keeps them busy for as long as they have coins. They tend to lose interest when they run out because they don't have patience to wait.
B008L5FFP6|5.0|Excellent CD. It was recommended by my son. I enjoyed it so much I ordered their older one to listen to.
B0096CDG0O|4.0|Fast paced fun game to play....come play with us.. it needs notification though. I have to check every once in a while to see if it's my turn. Other than that it's a good game...
B000OYC7A8|5.0|Buyer beware, amazon states that this DVD comes with the audio option \\"PCM Stereo Sound (48kHz/24bit),\\" which is lossless audio. This audio option, however, is what you get with the Bluray purchase, NOT the DVD. The DVD audio comes in AC3 (a Dolby product), which means that the audio stream is compressed to fit on the DVD, and is lossy (about the same as a high bitrate mp3). This might be no big deal for those using their stock TV speakers or earbuds, but for the audiophile with high-end equipment, you may notice the difference. If you're looking for lossless audio, do NOT buy the DVD. Go straight for the Bluray. This is an amazon error which should be corrected.
0345803493|5.0|Normally I hate drama but in this story I don't mind it because it is in companion with hot monkey sex
B000FVQM2Y|4.0|This was a fascinating film.  The quality of the acting was excellent.  The production reminded me of British police procedurals such as Cracker(Robbie Coltrane) and Prime Suspect (Helen Mirren).  The manner in which the story line was developed could be distracting to some people, however it was one that has been used frequently in films.  This film would be one recommended to people who like British gritty crime dramas (see above).  As those are some I like very much, this was a film I really enjoyed seeing.  Since I am comparing it to the dramas mentioned above, I couldn't give it a 5 star rating.  It is very very good.
0345803485|5.0|In this story it was nice to see something other than the traditional romance novel and it expressed a more detailed series of sex scenes
B00CBRAD2A|4.0|Now if those of you that are fans of \\"Aunuld\\" don't like the movie you are allowed.  The rest of you we don't much care.  Schwarzennegger movies aren't about complex drama with Oscar acting skills.  They are about action, carnage, and sometimes some humor.  It's simple, you're a fan or you're not.  If you are this is right on target with something you would expect an aging Arny to do.  Arny is a sheriff in a small Southwestern town where some bad guys are going to plow through on their way to the border.  Arny may not still be a terminator, but he can still exterminate some bad guys with style. I like it.<br /><br />Recommendations:  [[ASIN:B002ID09DK The Negotiator [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:B000IXZ7MA 16 Blocks [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:B000NUYTK4 Bad Day at Black Rock]].<br /><br />P.S. Bring popcorn, not a la te da attitude.<br /><br />CA Luster
0345803507|5.0|This book is an end to a dream series that made me wish that books were able to come to life
B009NY43NY|1.0|This book is so disappointing in so many ways. I'm heart broken over what Harris decided to do with the characters. I've been a fan since book one and hoped that after the last couple of books things would turn out differently. I can't believe that Harris wouldn't keep her fans in mind when writing this final book. I'm glad it's over though because now I can write my own ending that will actually match up with how she had the books playing out to begin with. This last book makes me want to read the Twilight series again because at least in those books I get what I'm hoping for a perfect HEA. Maybe Harris should consider retracting this book and leaving us hanging on the previous one because honestly, I'd rather be hanging on waiting for something that never comes than to have my heart crushed because I read this book. Harris has so much potential as a writer it's a shame she got everyone interested just to let them down. Writing was good but the plot and ending suck. I just can't express how heartbroken I am over this final book. Oh well maybe someday we will get a writer who knows what their fans want and give it to them in just as an exciting way as Harris failed to do.<br /><br />My suggestion for anyone thinking of purchasing this book.............. Don't do it. Wait until your local library has it and check it out for free and be heartbroken with the rest of the fans.
B00985E3UG|3.0|It's good reading material but it only gives one point of view. As per salt, sugar and fat, as they relate to processed food and some of the background research that goes into developing a product this book is very informative. The con is that as it relates to each aspect it only gives one point of view. It does attempt to interview leaders within each aspect so that the point of view is educated and well supported.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I bought this book with the expectation that it would be consistent with the quality of all the other Sookie Stackhouse books, and I was deeply and completely disappointed. Can I get my money back? It seams to me that she counted on the success of the other stackhouse books, enough that we would let this junk ride. This book was a lazy substitute.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a pretty good book.  I really liked this one, can't wait to read the third one.<br /><br />Thank you.
B00BXLU1EU|5.0|i know my wifi password by heart but the app gave me something different i tried it and it worked to i was in shock id recomend
B00BIRRDZ4|2.0|Doesn't have harmonies,  Doesn't have the Jackson Brown sound.  The best song is the single however do yourself a favor and just by that one.  But really do you want to listen to a song that is about the fear of flying anyway?
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I love it. there's a bunch of armies you can unlock and by. you fly through city's fighting robots and copy cats. could play forever if kindle had unlimeted battery
B004UID2LC|4.0|Watch videos whenever you want w/o a connection. Downloads right to my sd card without any problems and can be moved.
B006MPKD54|5.0|Interest capturing throughout, I could not guess the unexpected twist in the story until it was revealed towards the end
B009NY43NY|1.0|Disgusted, disappointed, disillusioned and yet not surprised.  Charlaine Harris is a horrid writer who should thank Alexander Skarsgard's portrayal of Eric for her series success.  Even though her quality of writing is not worthy of my time nor attention, I have been a loyal fan to her series.  Despite seeing spoilers for this book, I read it the day it came out hoping they would be wrong.  Surely, someone would not revise the history, motivations and personalities of all of their characters in the last book of a series.  But, alas Ms. Harris does just that in a way that is unbelievable, far-fetched and difficult to read.  I will never read another word that she writes.  Save your money! Imagine your own ending as anything would be better than this drivel.
B000YDE43C|4.0|Somewhat big for my size (about 1 size bigger). The shoes' bottoms do not seem durable, but I like the shoes' style.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|so so takes to long to get up grades but fun could be better if you had money lol but it's. a real fun game cant stop playing it
B000JIHP88|5.0|My daughter has been drawn to this from about three months on. She is now almost eight months and still loves to watch the mobile. The music is nice too.
0345349571|5.0|I remember noticing this book as a kid, before I knew the meaning of the word \\"calamitous.\\" It was sitting on one of my Dad's bookshelves, and I found myself intrigued by the title, mentally picturing an ornate enchanted mirror that reflected images from far off centuries.<br /><br />While I may have initially picked this book up because of a nostalgic childhood memory, I'm glad that I did. I knew so little about the 14th century before delving into its pages. I suppose I could have told you that it was the century when the plague broke out in Europe, but little else. The Battle of Poitiers, the Black Prince, a ransomed king (as in \\"a king's ransom\\"!), peasant revolts, misguided crusaders, bands of roving mercenaries, eccentric noblemen, the seeds of the future protestant reformation, a king trying to rule amid fits of insanity -- all of these had previously escaped my notice. I found it a very engaging and accessible read: denser than, say, David McCullough, but not at all laborious.<br /><br />When an author tackles a subject as immense as an entire century, I'm always curious as to the organization of the book and how it will hang together. The thread that unifies this work is the life of Enguerrand de Coucy VII, a nobleman who played a central role in the political events of the day. I found it to be a good choice: not a king, but still someone involved in national upheavals of the time. And while much of the narrative focuses on key social and political figures, Ms. Tuchman also opens windows into the lives and perspectives of ordinary people of the day.<br /><br />The mirror may not have been enchanted, but I am glad to have finally peered in to see reflections of this far off century.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I really liked the interview format and all the different perspectives from different people at different times of the z war. Unlike many zombie apocalypse stories out there Brooks presents glimpses of post war society along with the issues you might be facing after such an event.
0765325950|5.0|Brandon Sanderson has succeeded in in tying together the many strings spun by Robert Jordan.<br />A good read if you have followed the series.<br />The ending is both unexpected and fitting.<br /><br />I will have to order some Brandon Sanderson books as a result.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Advice is very practical and helpful. Would suggest reading this together with your partner and it's def worth reading more than once the realize the full benefit. This helped my relationship and I've learned a few things about myself at the same time.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is a very good game for people who like marvel comics needed game very good I give this game 5 stars
0451450523|3.0|Like many, I learned about The Last Unicorn from beloved author Patrick Rothfuss (Name of the Wind). This is his all-time favorite book, and he is constantly singing its praises. Since Pat's books rank among my favorites, it should be a no-brainer that I'd be a fan of his favorites too. Not so fast.<br /><br />Beagle's prose is elegant and inspired so there's no question we're in the company of a master. Still, neither the story nor the characters ever captivated me, and that's what really matters. I suspect it's a taste issue for me.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved this book so much! So worth the five dollars! Buy it now and care about life more in a touching way...
193700788X|5.0|As always, CH is true to her characters and her creation. Negative reviewers seem to be upset because their own fantasies haven't been fulfilled, ignoring the fact that Sookie's dreams were simple ones - a home, a family, someone to love who would love her back. How much worse the series end would be if, carrying the scars of her many adventures, Sookie had turned into someone entirely different. Congratulations to the author.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this series and the happy ending was awesome a rare treat. I will watch for more books from this author
B00969PR18|2.0|Doesnt have the country that I needed. Plus a lot of the futures dont work. Keeps saying coming soon and that was a while ago.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I have always been a fan of Abraham Lincoln, and knew I would love this movie.  I especially liked that it showed a side of Lincoln that is not normally brought out in movies and books.
193700788X|1.0|I am a huge Sookie Stackhouse fan but the last several books have been a let down and the final one was the worst. I can only say that if I re-read any of the series I will stop at the ninth book(which i have done in the past)because it goes no where after that. I think CH was tired and done and the fans paid the price. Oh well.
B009NY43NY|1.0|SPOILER- DON'T READ IT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED<br />AGAIN SPOILERS!!!!!<br /><br />I'm very sad about the outcome of this series. Too many years invested in the relationship between Sookie and Eric.  It seems Mrs Harris has shown that she can benefit from the readers money but not from the readers opinions.<br />Let me explain myself first. I joined CH's board years ago after I watched a New Year's marathon of Trueblood's first season.  when I found the series was based on the books, I went to amazon and bought the box set. Over the next week, I read all of them. At the beginning because of Trueblood, I was a Bill fan. after reading book 2, that changed and by book 4 (my personal favorite) I was an EL.  Eric is feature in every book, he has more page than any other suitor. So you can understand the shock when The HEA is revealed as Sam. Not Bill, not Alcide, not Quinn. Sam, her friend, her boss.<br />Sookie wanted something different at the beginning of the series. She wanted to meet someone she can't read telepathically. That's why she fell for Bill in the first place but in the end she ends up with a guy who she can read easily.<br />Eric has done many wonderful things through the years for Sookie. But, it the last book he is written as a selfish vampire.<br />But, not only does Sookie looses the man she loves, and settles for not even a second choice, she looses her friend. Pam is gone for the most part, since Sookie is banned from Fangtasia.<br />Worse, is that Eric, who is a rape victim, now is forced to marry a woman he doesn't love and has to be enslaved for 200 years.<br />My understanding is that some writers were defending CH about the fans been upset at her. I will recommend for them to first read her books (from the library, don't pay for them), then listen to the fans. Over the years, her board was the most hostile place I have ever been too. Her mods were extremely rude to EL's and newbies. Most of us left because there is no reason to tolerate the abuse. We have lives, lol.<br />Let me give you examples, if you are familiar with these writers, this is more or less what CH had done to us:<br />It will be like Kim Harrison- killing Trent on her last book and Itchy witch ending married to Jenks.<br />It will be like Jeaninne Frost's Bones leaving Cat and moving away. And Cat starting over with Tate.<br />It will be like Ilona's Kate Daniels going into hiding with Witness Protection and Curran falling for a vampire.<br />It will be like JWR's Zhadist getting captured again and Bella settling with Rhev.<br />It will be like Richelle Mead's Rose, not choosing Dimitri, not even Adrian, but running away with another teacher.<br />It will be like Stephanie Meyer's Bella, not ending with Edward or Jacob, but one of the pack like Sam.<br />It will be like Karen Marie Moning's Mac going back to USA, and Barron's dying.<br />It will be like  Patricia Briggs' Mercy marrying Stephan, while Adam marries someone within the pack.<br />Please feel free to insert your favorite couple next.<br /><br />At the end, Sookie is worst than when the series started, because she now knows what she is going to be missing. She will have a dull existence. And are we to believe that after one year of Sookie's protection, Sam will be able to protect her from the vamps? The same vamps that CH says we CAN'T trust?<br />Last, this author should be ashamed of calling her fans: malicious, disgruntled, entitled, immature, virulent and trolls. This is childish behavior, leaning towards a narcissist personality disorder and she is unable to take any criticism. I abjured you from my reading list.<br />The only good thing that came out of CH's boards, were the friends I made in meebo, full of intelligent, sweet, charming, happy women who shared the love of the vampire Eric. (EL's and my sinners, yay!)<br />This book is DEAD to ME.<br />1/5 starsthe abuse.
